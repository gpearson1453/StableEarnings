Footnotes
EXCELLENT MARK was urged between foes disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, edged forward leaving midstretch while shifting
inwards under pressure and narrowly maintained the advantage to the end. GIOVANE'S PROMISE, bumped by ATTU ISLAND, then forced out at the start,
was collected, then guided to the inside leaving the gap while being prompted to commence a steady advance, saved ground to upper stretch drawing into
striking distance, shifted out four wide nearing the sixteenth marker and surged to challenge nearing the wire while just failing to gain even terms with the
winner. TWO STEP DANCE, urged inside foes disputing the pace through the backstretch to upper stretch, altered course avoiding tight quarters while
losing the advantage to the eventual winner near the furlong marker and weakened approaching the wire. LIL GREEN MACHINE broke sharply, vied for
command three deep between foes through the backstretch into the lane and faded in late stages. NONA RAC tracked off the first flight well off the inside
racing to the turn, angled five wide nearing upper stretch but offered no rally. BOURBON BROWN joined the pace four wide in the opening quarter, pressed
the issue in that path racing into the turn and gave way after a half. ROYAL BIZ, reserved well off the leaders along the inside through the backstretch,
shifted out racing into the lane but never seriously menaced. ATTU ISLAND swerved out at the start bumping GIOVANE'S PROMISE soundly and never
menaced thereafter.

Footnotes
ACTING LUCKY broke readily, dictated the pace between foes on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, went clear entering the turn and maintained
a comfortable advantage along the inside to the end under mild encouragement. MISS ITALY was settled along the rail in the opening quarter, saved
ground on the turn gathering momentum, came through inside foes racing past midstretch and edged a rival for the place honors. MONIQUES DAREDEVIL
was settled between foes in the last flight in the opening stages, shifted inwards splitting foes while angling to the rail nearing the half mile marker, steadily
gained position racing into the turn, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch and continued with interest in that path while being outkicked for second.
LETS TAKE IT IZZY, forwardly placed along the inside prompting the pacesetter, continued in pursuit of that foe to upper stretch, faded between rivals in
late stages, then was vanned off the course following the race. MY BLONDE MARY exchanged with CATIRUSIA after the start, was collected, then urged to
gain some position racing four wide into the turn, then continued in that path to the stretch while lacking the needed late bid. ME SAY SO settled between
foes in early stages and never gained contention. DRILL'S VALENTINE, urged three deep prompting the pacesetter through the backstretch, emptied out
early. CATIRUSIA exchanged bumps after the start, was settled into stride dropping well back, swung out six wide entering the stretch but offered no rally.
LOVIN LIVIN settled outside foes in the last flight, was fanned five wide into the stretch but had no closing bid.

KHOZANDO, in touch with the leaders three deep racing to the first turn, was rated just off the leaders on the backstretch, was prompted to challenge three
deep nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage and went clear through the lane under firm encouragement. SKILLFUL, bumped, then squeezed
between foes in the opening stages, was reserved between rivals in the last flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide nearing the far turn while
being prompted to advance, rallied to contention in that path leaving the far turn but couldn't gain terms with the winner while clearly second best. MR.
EINSTEIN was prompted to a forward placing along the rail racing to the first turn, tracked just off the pacesetter inside the eventual winner on the
backstretch, tipped off the inside awaiting an opening between leaving the quarter mile marker to upper stretch but advanced between foes to prevail for a
share. THRU THE VINE was urged prompting the pace between foes, then outside a rival racing through the backstretch, dueled between foes on the far
turn and gave way into upper stretch. FEISTY KITTEN, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, then shifted out
four wide racing through the stretch to gain some position while making no impact. ACTION WARRIOR made brief pursuit of the leaders four wide into the
first turn and steadily faded after a half. STARSHIP OREO, came through close quarters while being urged to the lead along the inside racing into the first
turn, dueled for command inside foes through the far turn and gave way into the lane. SPANISH SOUL bumped, then shuffled out of tight quarters in the
opening stages, pulled his way outside foes while a bit rank to race five wide into the first turn carrying out ALPERES and quickly emptied out. ALPERES,
carried wide racing into the first turn, never gained contention. STRIKING IT LUCKY broke outwards bumping SKILLFUL forcing that rival into SPANISH
SOUL, was held up avoiding tight quarters nearing the first turn, dropped out racing into the backstretch, then was vanned off the course following the race.

Footnotes
SMART SPENDING broke readily, moved to lead just off the rail racing to the first turn to dictate the pace in hand on a narrow advantage, maintained that
margin while shifting to the inside racing into the far turn, then was roused clear racing through the stretch to prove best. FEETS OF FEATHER tracked off
the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance shifting out four wide nearing upper stretch, then continued in that path to
the end to edge a rival for the place honors on the wire. LEXOPHILIA angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, steadily
gained position along the rail racing into the far turn, tipped off the inside racing past midstretch while being roused to advance but lacked the needed final
kick. LULLABY LAND, reserved in early stages, angled to the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch gaining some position but
lacked the needed final kick. BALL LIGHTNING, firmly rated outside a rival as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out three deep after
a half gaining striking distance racing into the second bend, moved to lodge a brief bid between foes in that path nearing upper stretch but flattened out in
the drive. SWEET MOOCHIE, reserved between foes to the backstretch, switched out nearing the far turn while being urged to advance, was caught five
wide nearing the lane and had no late response. MUSETTA, reserved between foes to the backstretch, never gained contention. FALL MOON broke in the
air, then stumbled badly at the start, raced well off the field to the backstretch and never menaced thereafter. MASTERING BELA, urged to a forward
placing along the inside pursuing the pacesetter to the backstretch, gave way between foes after a half.

Footnotes
MARKHAMIAN broke readily, disputed the pace inside a rival leaving the chute, angled to the rail dueling for command racing into the turn, was headed
racing into upper stretch but gamely resisted racing past midstretch to regain the advantage and edged forward under brisk right handed pressure.
PROVOCATEUR stalked just off the leaders along the inside under light rating through the backstretch, shifted out three wide midway through the turn while
being prompted to advance, bid for command three deep entering the lane while striking the front but was outkicked by the winner. CATTIN tracked just off
the leaders outside a rival in the opening stages, moved to striking distance while being fanned four wide racing through the turn, couldn't match terms with
the top pair racing into upper stretch but continued evenly through the closing stages to prevail for a share. MAGICAL MOUSSE, in touch attending a rival's
pace on his own courage in the opening stages, pressed the issue nearing the turn to strike the front, dueled for command between foes through the bend
to upper stretch and gave way leaving the furlong marker. CYBERVIKING, outpaced in early stages while shifting well off the inside, shifted out four wide
racing into the lane and edged some rivals for position late while making no real impression. MORGAN POINT settled well off the leaders, saved ground
through the turn to upper stretch but offered no rally. GOLD SPECIAL settled outside foes on the backstretch and offered no rally.

Footnotes
OUTFOXED raced unhurried while shifting out to the four path tracking the first flight from just out of striking distance on the backstretch, was prompted to
advance in that path through the bend, steadily drew on terms with the leader racing into upper stretch and responded to firm left handed pressure to edge
forward of that foe in time. GODDESS OF FIRE was settled well off the second flight while racing well off the rail on the backstretch, gathered momentum
nearing the lane, swung out five wide in upper stretch and continued with solid momentum to close the gap on the winner while edging a rival for the place
honors at the wire. STRATEGIC BIRD, in touch with the leaders three deep attending the pace on her own courage racing through the backstretch, pressed
the issue entering the turn, edged forward racing into upper stretch, shifted to the inside resisting the winner's bid past midstretch but couldn't quite fend off
that rival, then lost second on the wire. HA' PENNY tracked off the first flight inside foes racing through the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into
upper stretch and continued with an effort to gain position between foes. DEVINE CHARGER, urged along the rail disputing the pace through the
backstretch, dueled for command inside foes racing into the turn and gave way racing into upper stretch. SHE NASTY settled last racing to the turn, then
passed outside some tiring rivals in the closing stages. EROS'S GIRL angled inwards to track off the first flight between foes on the backstretch, angled to
the rail racing through the turn and gave way into the lane. PLATINUM GEM, urged between foes pressing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way
into upper stretch.

Footnotes
PRINCESS ELIN came through close quarters just after the start, then raced unhurried along the inside dropping well off the leaders on the backstretch,
switched off the inside gaining some position racing into the turn, swung out five wide entering upper stretch and produced a solid closing response to wrest
the advantage in the closing stages under firm handling. QUALITY settled well off the field while angling to the inside in the opening quarter, shifted out five
deep following the winner's path into the stretch and was going well late to close the gap on that foe nearing the wire. BELLE OF THE BALL, bumped at the
start, switched out three deep while being prompted in pursuit of the leaders to the turn, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch, altered course nearing
midstretch, shifting inwards bumping BROOKWOOD HILLS, then shifted to the inside in the final stages while continuing well enough to prevail for a share.
LI'L MISS CAMILLE, urged to the lead between foes racing through the backstretch into the turn, dueled outside a rival into upper stretch but yielded once
headed by the winner. ILLOGICAL LOVE, in touch with the leaders three wide prompting the pace to the turn, steadily faded in late stages. UNBRIDLED
ENSIGN settled outside foes dropping well off the leaders racing to the turn, then made some belated progress five wide through the stretch.
BROOKWOOD HILLS tracked just off the first flight in the opening stages, shifted inwards splitting rivals racing into the turn, moved to press the issue along
the rail midway through the bend, but flattened out while being bumped racing past midstretch. LAUGH AND PLAY swerved in sharply at the crossing the
path of ATOMIC ROSE, then bumping BELLE OF THE BALL, was settled near the inside, saved ground to the lane and had no closing bid. SUMMER OF
MISCHIEF angled to the inside briefly pursuing the pacesetter on the backstretch but emptied out early. ATOMIC ROSE was off slowly while being cut off at
the start and never gained contention.

Footnotes
SHIRL'S SPEIGHT broke readily, was carried inwards racing through the chute by DRIFTWOOD, stalked that rival along the rail into the backstretch, saved
ground through the far turn while continuing under patient handling, tipped outside the leader racing into upper stretch, wrested the advantage and went
clear late under firm handling. HIDDEN STASH, held up along the inside racing to the first turn, tracked off the second flight along the inside to the far turn,
angled three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady late bid to edge a rival for second. DRIFTWOOD pulled his way to the lead while
angling to the rail midway through the chute, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin to the far turn, held sway into upper stretch but yielded once headed
by the winner. KURAMATA (IRE), caught in tight quarters nearest the inside in the opening stages, was reserved near the inside to the backstretch, swung
outside foes on the far turn to race four wide into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick to miss for a share while finishing in hand nearing the wire.
KYGO (GER) reserved outside foes racing to the backstretch, was fanned five wide into the stretch to gain some position but made no real impact.
PATRIOT DRIVE shifted inwards racing through the chute while crossing over the path of SONNY SMACK, tracked off the second flight between foes to the
backstretch, shifted out three deep between foes racing through the far turn while being urged to advance but had no closing response. A ROSE FOR
RAVEN tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted three wide into the far turn to lodge a brief bid, but flattened racing into
the stretch. TWO STEPPIN KLUKI, forwardly placed tracking just outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, emptied out early. SONNY SMACK,
caught in tight quarters, then squeezed between foes in the opening stages, clipped heels racing through the chute, was collected while dropping out last
and trailed the field to the lane.

Footnotes
NANTUCKET RED was urged clear racing into the first turn while shifting off the rail, came under pressure switching well off the inside to maintain a clear
margin racing through the far turn, drifted out racing through the stretch while under right handed pressure but kicked away nearing the wire to prove best.
ALLWORTHY was settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into the far turn while being prompted to
advance, drew into striking distance while angling to the inside racing into upper stretch and prevailed for the place honors between foes while proving no
match for the winner. DON'T GET KHOZY was rated off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three wide between
foes racing through the far turn, angled to the rail racing into upper stretch and narrowly prevailed for a share nearing the wire. STRIKING CHROME tracked
just off the second flight three deep to the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path racing into the far turn, was fanned four wide into upper
stretch, then shifted inside the winner in the closing stages while being outkicked for a share. MOLLY'S ANGEL tracked the pacesetter from just out of
striking distance between foes in the opening half, advanced on the leader to lodge a brief bid between foes racing through the far turn, lost her path to the
eventual winner while shifting inside that foe racing into the stretch but flattened out late. SERENE angled to the inside racing to the backstretch while being
urged in brief pursuit of the leader inside foes but emptied out entering the second bend. SPECIAL PRINCESS, forwardly placed tracking the pacesetter a
bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, emptied out after a half. WE THE CLOUDS, caught four wide racing into the first turn, settled outside foes in the
last flight and never gained contention.

Footnotes
INVESTMENTSTRATEGY (GB) was rated along the rail stalking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, came through inside that foe to gain the
advantage nearing upper stretch, switched off the inside while being roused to turn back LALOBA FEROZ, drifted wide in the closing stages but maintained
a narrow advantage to the end under strong handling. The latter angled to the rail racing through the chute to track off the second flight along the inside,
shifted out nearing upper stretch splitting foes three deep, moved to challenge the winner leaving midstretch, was floated out in late stages but continued to
close the gap while her rider appeared to misjudge the wire. STARSHIP BELMONT, urged to the lead between foes, dictated the pace a bit off the rail to the
far turn, dueled outside the eventual winner into upper stretch and kept on well enough to earn a share. WEEZY DOES IT was rated between foes dropping
off the second flight, conceded some position under patient handling racing to the second bend, shifted out four wide racing through the far turn, angled
inwards a bit entering the stretch and continued with an effort to gain some position. SILVER SEA, reserved along the inside in the last flight to the
backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, then tipped off the inside in the closing stages to improve position between foes. DAKOTA DANCER worked
her way to the inside racing to the first turn, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid. BEACH BREEZE settled outside foes racing to
the far turn and displayed some belated interest four wide late. FANTASTIC RAFAELA tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the
backstretch but emptied out early. VENUS OYZO, forwardly placed four wide tracking the pacesetter to the far turn, gave way nearing the lane.
RICHEBOURG, forwardly placed three deep between foes tracking just outside the pacesetter to the backstretch, came under pressure in that path racing
into the far turn but quickly emptied out. FAREWELL LADY tracked off the second flight outside foes early, switched out five wide on the backstretch while
being urged along with a brief bid but emptied out racing into the second bend.
