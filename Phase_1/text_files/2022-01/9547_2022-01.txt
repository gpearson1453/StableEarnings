Footnotes
ARDTREA chased leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, ranged up three wide in upper stretch and edged away under a stiff
drive. SOUTHERN VENTURE away well and cleared rivals quickly, entered turn clear, entered stretch clear, overtaken in upper stretch by rival and stayed
on gamely to be second best. LAKER JET tracked clear leader along the inside, continued to save ground into the turn and into the stretch, launched bid
along the rail and kept on to hold show. SEA GLASS stalked paced two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered stretch widest and
made some late progress. SURPRISE PARTY off slow and settled, two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn and never launched a rally
three wide in the stretch. MISS HELEN BACK head turned when gates opened and came away slow, settled at the rear of the field two wide, continued two
wide on the turn and never improved position. BLUE BUTTERFLY off slow, settled along the inside on the backstretch, continued to save ground and never
a factor.
