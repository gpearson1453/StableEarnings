Footnotes
FROSTED BOURBON just off the inside in pursuit, tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and
came in under a right handed crop bumping U SHOULD B DANCING straightened away, dug in under a drive trading light bumps with that rival through to
inside the eighth pole before coming in under a right hand stick again inside the sixteenth marker taking over the lane directly in front of U SHOULD B
DANCING albeit not breaking that rival's momentum and rallied to just get up in the last jump to the finish. HEY MAMA hustled from the gate, showed the
way lightly coaxed along the inside two path under pressure from a pair to the outside, tucked inside into the turn shaking off those rivals to widen away to a
brief safe lead, spun just off the inside for home under renewed threat from a pair, dug in under a drive coming outwards slightly near the sixteenth marker
tightening up the lane of U SHOULD B DANCING loosely between foes and was nailed in the final stride to the wire. U SHOULD B DANCING stumbled at
the start and was bumped between foes who each broke her way conceding four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased along the inside
down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from just past the seven-sixteenths, advanced into contention nearing the
quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got bumped straightened away by FROSTED BOURBON, dug in loosely between foes trading light
bumps under a left handed stick through to inside the eighth pole, had her seam tighten up as HEY MAMA came out slightly near the sixteenth pole, and
was tepidly handled before FROSTED BOURBON took over the lane in front, got hand ridden to the finish to be along well clear and best of the rest.
MADAME ROSE hustled from the start, pressed the pace three then two wide between foes getting shaken off with seven-sixteenths to go, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired. BANK STATEMENT broke in a step at the start bumping U SHOULD B DANCING in
concert with ARDUOUSLY, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and made no impact. ARDUOUSLY broke
out at the start bumping U SHOULD B DANCING in tandem with BANK STATEMENT, prompted the pace four then three wide, got shaken off with
seven-sixteenths to go and then came under coaxing from the three-eighths, went five wide into upper stretch and tired. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into
the stretch run focusing on FROSTED BOURBON as well as a Claim of foul by the rider of U SHOULD B DANCING alleging interference in the stretch
against FROSTED BOURBON. After review, the claim of the foul was dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.

ZOOMER stumbled at the start but recovered quickly, tracked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under the
crop, gained to take the lead inside the furlong marker and prevailed under strong urging. SOMEDAY JONES angled in at the rear of the field, settled at the
back, was roused three then four wide on the far turn and finished with good energy to garner the place. LITTLE MENACE was hustled from the start,
contested the pace on the inside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, led under a drive into the final furlong then was
overtaken while clear for the show. STRIKING SPEED was hustled from the break, disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn,
dropped back into upper stretch and tired. HIEROGLYPHICS was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path
and failed to respond then faltered.

Footnotes
GLASS CEILING was rated just off the pace under a snug hold, drafted behind foes in the two path for most of the turn, shifted three wide while let out late
on that bend, rallied to the lead into upper stretch, shook clear into the final furlong then drifted in some under the crop and powered away under strong
urging to prove much the best. ITS COLD IN DEHERE broke out and lost her footing some at the start and was off a bit slow, was urged along at the rear,
moved up then was placed under a hold near the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, angled out into the final
furlong and finished willingly for the place. AUNT KAT was sent hard from the start, showed speed on the inside of a foe then was taken back at the
three-quarter pole and switched out, moved up to dispute the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive,
jostled with a foe around the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened while just able to get the show. OXANA was hustled from
the gate, angled in while going to the front, out-sprinted AUNT KAT to set the pace, was joined by that foe on the outside before the five-eighths, took an
awkward stride while brushing the rail inside the half-mile pole, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked for her best into upper stretch, jostled with a foe
near the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and tired then just missed the show. VILLANELLE moved in early then was urged along near
the back, gained closer around the nine-sixteenths, was roused in the two path on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed
response. LETMETAKETHISCALL tracked the pace on the outside, chased three then four wide on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
BISTRITA hustled from the gate, showed the way along the inside down the backstretch and through the turn getting set down spinning just off the inside
into upper stretch, drew off under a drive before getting geared down through the final sixteenth to the finish to prevail comfortably on the line. LINARITE
coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch, tipped out nearing the eighth
pole, proved no match for the top one while running on clear of the rest and second best. MAJESTIC SPIRIT hustled from the start, chased three to four
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. CLOSING DEALS chased two to
three wide under a ride from three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. GRACIE O'MALLEY coaxed from the
gate, chased along the inside coaxed along from midway on the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. GLITTERING PRIZE stumbled at
the start conceding three lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased four to five wide down the backstretch and through the turn getting placed to
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. KOKUTAI broke in at the start, chased three to four paths off the inside until
tucked to the two path through the turn, got coaxed along midway, continued in the two path into upper stretch and trailed.

CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, took the lead outside the five-sixteenths, shook clear under a
drive in upper stretch, drew away under the crop into the final seventy yards then was eased up while much the best. EQUAL MEASURE was hustled from
the start then coaxed along early, had the rider take a hold near the three-quarter pole when a foe crossed in front then leveled out again, chased inside to
the two path on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. CHARGE ACCOUNT showed
good speed, set the pace under pressure to her outside, was asked while along the rail on the turn, lost the lead to the winner outside the five-sixteenths
pole, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and weakened but was clear for the show. BLUE PAYNT stumbled badly at the start, was taken in hand
early then rated off the pace, moved out near the nine-sixteenths, chased four then three wide on the turn and tired. BEE BIT moved out early then tracked
the pace, came up empty in the three then four path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
CAZILDA FORTYTALES coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn, got set down taking the inside
route into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. SNICKET chased along the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun three then two wide into upper stretch straightened away and ran on to chase the winner home safe for the place honors. BELLA
PRINCIPESSA broke in a step at the start and bumped MIA BEA STAR, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing
at the seven-sixteenths and advancing, swung three to four wide for home, offered up a bid to the eighth pole, kept on well clear of the rest for the show
honors. ENTER SANDWOMAN chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and improved
position for the last major share. MIA BEA STAR got bumped at the start by BELLA PRINCIPESSA, chased three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, tipped five wide into upper stretch and tired. THAT IS KEY chased just off the inside under coaxing from midway on the turn, took the inside
route into upper stretch and tired. CAPTIVATING CARA brushed the near side stall at the start, came under coaxing and chased two to three wide from just
off the pace, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, faded and went seven wide into upper stretch, then faltered in the drive. ANCIENT BROWN brushed the
off side stall at the start getting away a half a beat slow, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, spun
three wide for home and folded.

Footnotes
MAGIC CIRCLE bumped with a rival at the start, went to the front, raced inside on the first turn, was well rated while setting the pace, traveled around the
far turn in the two path, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, shook clear into the stretch, drew off under a drive into the final furlong and maintained a
safe advantage under steady urging. MORNING MATCHA bumped with a foe just after the start and was in tight, saved ground around the first turn, moved
out on the backstretch, was urged along passing the five-eighths, went three then four wide on the far turn and finished willingly for the place. REIGNING
CHICK broke in and bumped with a foe, angled to the rail early, settled on the inside, jostled with a foe while trying to squeeze through along the rail inside
the three-eighths and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. ROSEBUG raced in the three path around the opening bend, stalked the pace on
the outside, chased in the three path on the far turn and tired. WATERS OF MEROM bumped with an opponent at the start, rounded the first turn in the two
path, was rated under a hold, dropped back late on the backstretch, was urged along in the two path on the final turn, jostled with a rival inside the
three-eighths and came up empty. GAMESTONKS bumped with a rival just after the break and was in tight, went around the first turn in the two path,
lagged at the rear and faltered.

Footnotes
MAZAL EIGHTEEN broke on top, then briefly lost command to VIOLENTIAM before advancing to knock heads with that rival while four paths off the inside,
tucked to the two path half a mile from home and shook away into the turn before widening away from the field through the bend, took the inside route into
upper stretch, got roused with three-sixteenths to go and held clear to the finish to prevail. VIOLENTIAM coaxed from the gate, took sole command briefly
tucking to the inside before dueling with the aforementioned foe to the half mile pole, got shaken off inside that station and gave chase through the turn
coming under coaxing three furlongs out, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive chasing the winner home while holding for the place
honors over a trio. SEAHORSE D'ORO three then two wide at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six to seven wide into
upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the show honors. TELLAPERFECTTALE coaxed from the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, lugged in near the eighth pole despite a left handed crop, dug in under a drive keeping on and brushing
the rail inside the final sixteenth when getting inwards again and was along to share in the last major share on the wire. RED PEPPER GRILL coaxed from
the gate, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and improved position to dead heat at the finish for
the last major share. WRITE THIS DOWN chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened. HANDLE THE TRUTH chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. HALF
DAY PAM coaxed from the start, raced two to three wide forwardly placed early on, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and retreated, swung four wide
into upper stretch and folded.
