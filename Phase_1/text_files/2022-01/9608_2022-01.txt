Footnotes
AZURA was urged disputing the pace while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, gained a narrow advantage approaching the backstretch, dictated
terms to the second bend, then responded to firm handling to maintain a clear margin to the end. EXCEPT TEMPTATION, caught in close quarters, then
held up between foes to stalk just off the pacesetter to the backstretch under light rating, was prompted to close the gap on that rival racing through the far
turn while his rider took a look back nearing upper stretch but settled for second when failing to gain even terms with the winner. ZURI was rated off the first
flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was prompted to gain position between foes after a half, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch but
lacked the needed final kick while earning a share. CECI'SAPRILHOTTIE was rated off the first flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance midway through the backstretch to the far turn but lacked the needed closing bid. MORENA DANCER ducked outwards a bit at the
start, was settled last to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. SENA THE DUCHESS, urged to a forward placing three deep racing through the
first turn to the backstretch, emptied out after a half.

Footnotes
RIDE EM was urged inside a rival disputing the pace through the backstretch, shook away from that foe racing into the turn, forged well clear racing into
upper stretch and was kept to pressure. CHRISTMAS PRESENT was rated inside foes from out of striking distance foes to the turn, continued a bit off the
rail into the turn, then angled inside foes in the closing stages while finishing with interest to prevail for the place honors. CUZ broke out brushing a rival, was
settled out of close quarters while switching outside foes in early stages, was fanned five wide racing through upper stretch but continued to make some
mild progress while being outkicked for second. AKTHAM angled inwards a bit while being prompted to a forward placing, was urged three deep pursuing
the leaders into the bend, couldn't maintain striking distance and weakened between rivals late. JACKSON STRONG angled inwards while being urged to
force the pace outside a rival through the backstretch, lost terms with that rival racing through the turn and gave way nearing midstretch. POLITO tracked
the leaders between foes racing to the turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch but had no late kick.

GIVE IT A GO broke readily to gain a forward placing along the inside, conceded some ground to the leaders entering the first turn, tipped out three wide
after a half while coming under some prompting to advance on the pacesetter, moved to wrest the advantage leaving the three furlong marker, shifted to the
inside nearing upper stretch and held sway on a commanding advantage while being kept to firm left handed encouragement. GREAT JUNIOR tracked the
leaders from out of striking distance inside a rival as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance inside a rival racing into
the far turn, but could never gain striking distance while proving best of the others. JOEY THE CARPENTER was settled along the inside racing to the
backstretch, switched outside rivals racing through the far turn and continued with interest to gain some position three wide in the closing stages while no
real threat. QUICK HIT, forwardly placed stalking just outside the pacesetter racing to the first turn, advanced to press the issue midway through the
backstretch, set the pace into the second bend but proved no match when confronted by the winner and quickly gave way. THATZA ALPHA tracked off the
first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch and came up empty racing into the far turn. COLORS sprinted to the lead from between foes racing to the
first turn, then angled to the inside, set the pace into the backstretch and gave out once headed after a half. FURRY BEAR broke slowly, tracked off the
second flight racing to the backstretch and emptied out early.

INDY RIDE sped to the lead while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin while in hand through the backstretch,
maintained the advantage under light prompting to upper stretch, then held sway to the end in a ridden out effort. TAPSOLUTE, forwardly placed stalking
just off the pacesetter in early stages, was prompted to close the gap on the leader racing into the far turn, then continued with a steady bid to close the gap
late while always second best. WHISTLE ME HOME tracked off the first flight inside a rival racing to the backstretch, conceded some position under patient
handling nearing the far turn but continued with interest under confident handling to edge a rival for a share in the closing stages. PAINTER'S PRIDE
tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted three wide after a half while being urged to lodge a brief bid in that path racing into
the far turn but soon flattened out. SHAKEM N BREAKEM tracked off the second flight along the inside in early stages, switched outside rivals racing
through the far turn but offered no rally. MIRIAM'S SKY settled last to the backstretch and failed to menace. ZONIC tracked off the second flight along the
inside and came up empty racing into the far turn.

LATIN NIKKITA was rated just off the second flight in the opening quarter, gained some position three deep after a half, was prompted to advance with a
sharp move in that path on the far turn racing past the midway point of the bend, then continued with a sustained response to wrest the advantage past
midstretch and edged clear late under firm handling. ENDLESS was urged inside foes dictating the pace on a narrow advantage into the backstretch,
extended that margin racing into the far turn, resisted the winner's bid racing to midstretch but proved only second best. RIPLEY EFFECT was rated off the
second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped outside foes to race four wide into upper stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for
a share. HALLANVAARA settled last racing to the first turn while angling to the inside, saved ground throughout and gained some position inside rivals in
the closing stages while being outkicked for a share. SIGN AND SEAL, in touch between foes racing to the first turn, angled to the inside entering the
backstretch stalking just off the pacesetter to the second bend and steadily faded on the far turn. SONG OF THE HEART tracked off the second flight
outside foes to the backstretch and offered no rally. CAPETOWN CANDY, forwardly placed three wide racing to the first turn, shifted inwards nearing the
backstretch to track just off the pacesetter between rivals to the second bend and steadily faded nearing the lane.

MOLLY'S ANGEL, caught four wide racing to the first turn, was taken under rating while angling nearer the inside to track off the first flight to the
backstretch, continued under patient handling awaiting an opening racing into the far turn, swung out four wide approaching upper stretch and produced a
solid closing response to wrest the advantage late under firm handling. STRIKING CHROME was urged three deep between foes to gain terms with the
leaders racing into the first turn, prompted the pace in that path through the backstretch, edged forward racing through the far turn, briefly disputed the issue
inside the winner into the lane but proved no match late. BIG BAD DIVA, urged between foes pressing the pace from the outset, dueled for command to the
far turn and gave way into the lane. TONAL VERSE, urged along the inside to dictate the pace on a narrow advantage into the first turn, dueled for
command inside foes through the backstretch to the far turn and gave way.

EIGHT WEEKS LONG ducked out at the start while breaking slowly, settled last dropping well off the leaders racing to the first turn, was prompted to
advance inside foes on the backstretch, advanced with a sharp move along the rail approaching the three furlong marker to challenge for command, quickly
went clear approaching upper stretch while shifting a bit off the inside, then held sway through the stretch under steady pressure. COACH PAUL, forwardly
placed three deep between foes racing to the first turn, tracked just off the leaders to the second bend, was urged to advance three deep racing into the far
turn challenging for command, couldn't match terms with the winner but continued with a steady effort to edge rivals for the place honors late. BEACH
BANDIT was eased off the leaders while angling inwards racing to the first turn, was rated off the first flight a bit off the inside on the backstretch, was
prompted to advance racing between foes into the far turn, then shifted to the four path in the closing stages to edge a rival for a share. ASSERT
DOMINANCE, urged between foes racing to the first turn prompting the pacesetter, pressed the issue challenging for command racing into the far turn,
continued in pursuit of the pacesetter between foes to the lane and gave way in the drive. HIGHJUMP CHARLIE, caught four wide racing into the first turn
while under some prompting to contend, tracked the leaders outside foes to the far turn but had no closing response. CREATIVE CHOICE was urged
dictating the pace a bit off the rail racing to the backstretch, dueled inside foes in the two path racing to the far turn and abruptly gave out entering the
second bend.

Footnotes
FRU FRU ZAN was urged inside rivals prompting the pace while shifting to the inside racing through the backstretch, tipped out racing into the turn to press
the issue between foes through the bend, went clear racing into upper stretch and held WILLOUGHBY GAP on a safe margin to the end under firm
encouragement. The latter tracked just off the leaders along the inside racing into the bend, shifted out four wide in upper stretch, was roused to close the
gap on the winner and proved best of the others. EAST WING settled near the inside in the opening stages, swung outside rivals racing into the turn,
continued five wide leaving the bend into upper stretch but finished with interest to gain position while prevailing for a share. KITTY KITTY, held up off the
leaders while switching out four wide in the opening stages, was prompted to advance outside foes racing into the bend to lodge a brief, three wide bid
nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. DAILY BRIEFING, forwardly placed three wide prompting the pacesetter in the opening stages, faded between
foes into the lane. HITECH IS BACK, slow to gathered stride, raced wide to the turn and never gained contention. PHARAOH'S FASHION, urged to the lead
while angling inwards in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a narrow margin a bit off the rail in the opening quarter, angled inwards entering the turn
dueling for command inside foes and gave way after a half.

Footnotes
SILENT SONATA, caught four deep racing to the first turn, continued in that path to the backstretch tracking just off rivals in the second flight, made steady
progress three deep racing into the far turn to close the gap on the pacesetter, continued in a prolonged drive in that path to challenge for command leaving
midstretch and narrowly prevailed between foes in an all out drive. DIVINE CONTROL was rated off the second flight inside foes racing to the backstretch,
saved ground through the far turn while being prompted to advance nearing the lane, shifted off the inside racing through upper stretch to bid for command
four wide between foes in the final sixteenth and just missed. KING RAMOS broke outwards exchanging solid contact with STAR CHAMBER at the start,
was collected to track off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, switched outside the leaders while being prompted to advance four wide
nearing upper stretch, was fanned five wide midstretch and found his best response in the final stages to close the gap on the winner while edging rivals for
a share. ESTILO VARONIL, urged three deep between foes to gain a forward placing racing to the first turn, conceded the lead to track the pacesetter
between rivals while pulling against restraint racing to the backstretch, was urged to challenge for command between foes on the far turn, continued in a
protracted skirmish past midstretch while striking the front but was outkicked by the top trio while being taken in hand in the final strides. SHALDAG, urged
to the lead from between foes racing to the first turn, soon went clear in the second furlong, dictated the pace just off the inside through the backstretch, was
urged to fend off rivals racing through the far turn to upper stretch but faltered in the drive. STAR CHAMBER broke inwards exchanging solid contact while
momentarily dislodging his rider from his irons, was settled into stride but never gained contention. BIG POLO, urged along the inside pursuing the
pacesetter through the first turn, emptied out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT
TOOK NO ACTION.
