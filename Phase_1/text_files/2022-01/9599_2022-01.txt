CIRCLE BACK prompted the pace to the turn from a two wide path, was asked for run nearing the quarter-marker, shook free of the pacesetter inside of the
furlong marker and edged away in the end. PHILIPIE FAST saved ground while tracking the pace through the turn, the rider lost his crop inside of the
sixteenth-marker and was outfinished in the late stages. MIZZEN POWER was forwardly placed while two wide through the turn and was outkicked in the
drive. UNION BLISS stalked the pace outside of rivals, came under a ride leaving the turn, did not offer a late bid in the stretch and was reported to have
bled when pulled up. SMILING PATRICK was away alertly and was sent to set the fractions while saving ground, was pressured through the turn by the
winner, yielded the lead nearing the top of the lane and weakened in the late going. VENTRY saved ground while chasing the pace to the quarter-marker
and gave way in the stretch.

MARILYN'S SMILE stalked the pace from an inside position on the turn, angled out leaving the furlong grounds, gamely split foes nearing the sixteenth
marker, dueled with CROWN KITTEN in the final stages and dug in to prevail on the line. CROWN KITTEN tracked the pace outside of foes, was three wide
on the turn, closed well in the stretch under firm handling, vied for the lead inside of the sixteenth-marker and was nipped on the wire by the winner while
clear of the rest. I LOVE ROMANCE prompted the pace from a two wide position, vied for the lead inside of the furlong marker and was outfinished in deep
stretch. MOMMY ROSE stalked the pace from a two wide path on the turn and lacked a late bid in the stretch. NO COVER CHARGE was away alertly and
was sent to set the fractions while pressured through the turn, led to the furlong marker but ceded the lead at that point and gave way in the late stages.

Footnotes
DANIELA BELLA stalked the pace from an inside position, found a seam in upper stretch to vie for the lead, took command inside of the furlong marker, was
coaxed along through the lane and held driving in the end. DAMN THE TORPEDOES stalked the pace outside of rivals to the turn, gained ground along the
bend while four wide, was firmly urged through the stretch and while not able to reel in the winner was up in time to claim second. TORREY'S GIRL vied for
the early lead to the turn, set the fractions along the turn while being challenged, could not hold off the bid of DANIELA BELLA leaving the turn but kept on
in the stretch to secure third. SHE SAID YES contested the early pace to the turn then took back to track the leaders from a three wide path, was urged
along in upper stretch and was outkicked in the drive. LILA AT THE BEACH bumped with HOLY ZAGS at the start and was a bit slow in the early stages,
was two wide along the turn while still near the back, improved position into the stretch and continued that run in the late stages to close willingly at the
finish. PHANTOM INDIAN chased the pace from a three wide path and weakened in the late going. HOLY ZAGS exchanged bumps with LILA AT THE
BEACH leaving the break and was away slowly, saved ground through the turn while chasing the leaders and was not a factor. LA REINE'S LEGACY was
away in good order, disputed the early pace to the turn, vied for the lead to the quarter-marker and gave way in the stretch.

away alertly and set the pace to the second turn, was able to shake free of the prompting rival heading into the stretch run, felt pressure from the winner in
the final sixteenth and was gamely bested while well clear of the rest. CONFIDENCE BUILDER stalked the pace from a two wide path to the quarter-marker
and gave way in the drive. J AND M EXPRESS was bumped by the winner leaving the gate then stumbled sharply and was slow in the early going, was
three wide on the second turn while gaining ground but weakened in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
MISS SKI was hustled to press the pace into the turn, wore down the pacesetter along the turn and into the stretch, was urged through the final furlong and
held safely in the end. SOMARA stalked the pace outside of rivals, swung widest into the stretch, gained ground through the lane to close on the winner but
could not reel her in while besting the rest. CLOCHARD STREET stalked the pace from a two wide path, gained ground on the turn, angled out for the drive
and was outkicked in the late stages but was up in time to claim the show. RUN LIKE KONA was away alertly and was sent to set contested fractions, came
under pressure nearing the top of the stretch, weakened in the late going and just missed for third. SLEW OF FASHION saved ground while chasing the
pace to the turn and did not offer a final bid in the stretch. GEE STREET was slow leaving the break, trailed the field to the turn and lacked a late rally.

Footnotes
COUNTING CARDS stalked the pace while maintaining a ground saving position on the turn, waited a bit for room in upper stretch, tipped out leaving the
furlong marker when room opened, was firmly urged through the final sixteenth and was up in time to prevail. LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH was away well and
was sent to set quick fractions from the inside, extended the lead leaving the bend, was firmly urged in the final sixteenth and was nailed on the line while
clear of the rest. FLICFLAC stalked the pace from a three wide path on the turn, gained ground into the stretch, was outkicked in the drive but held on for
third over an oncoming rival. MEET THE SHERIFF was bothered at the start and was slow in the early going, chased the pace outside of rivals on the turn,
closed in the stretch and just missed for third in the end. HANDSOME GARY stalked the pace from a two wide path on the turn and did not mount a late
rally. MOHAWK KING (IRE) tracked the quick pace from a two wide position on the turn, lost ground into the stretch and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
STORMY SAMURAI exchanged bumps with STANFORD BAY leaving the start, stalked the fast pace from the second flight through the turn, swung out to
five wide for the drive and surged under firm handling to prevail. LOVE CANDY was allowed to settle in the early going while off of the rail, swung widest for
the drive, made a good rally through the final furlong and was gaining on the winner in the final sixteenth but could not reel him in while besting the rest.
NUESTRO ENGREIDO showed good early speed while dueling for the lead with STANFORD BAY, led inside of the furlong grounds but was caught by the
winner nearing the final sixteenth and was outfinished in the end. STANFORD BAY traded bumps with STORMY SAMURAI at the break, was sent to duel
on the lead with NUESTRO ENGREIDO through the turn, vied for the lead into the stretch run and tired in the late going. FASCINATED stalked the pace
from a two wide path on the turn, improved position into the stretch and weakened in the drive. TRIP TO SPAIN saved ground while chasing the early pace,
swung out three wide for the drive, lacked room in upper stretch, was steered out inside of the sixteenth-marker and bumped TOLONISITO and faltered in
the late stages. TOLONISITO stalked the pace from a three wide path on the turn, gained ground into the stretch run, was losing ground in the final

Footnotes
EXHALTING was hustled leaving the break to set fast fractions while being challenged, shook clear of HARBOR KITTY leaving the turn but was engaged by
the runner-up in the final furlong, held that foe at bay through the lane and held safely in the end to prevail. AWHITESPORTSCOAT tracked the early lead
from a two wide path, improved position along the turn, challenged the winner nearing the furlong marker and through the lane on the left lead but could not
reel him in in the late stages while clear of the rest. HARBOR KITTY steadied in traffic in the early going, pressed the pace from a two wide path on the turn,
lost ground into the stretch and was outfinished in the final stages but saved third in the end. PERFECT D stalked the pace while saving ground, was boxed
in in tight quarters approaching the quarter-marker, found room in upper stretch and was outkicked in the drive. ECOLOGIST stalked the pace from a three
wide position on the turn, gained along the turn and finished evenly in the late stages. WHOA BUDDY saved ground while stalking the pace from the second
flight, steadied in tight quarters along the turn and gave way in the stretch. EMERALD MAGIC showed no early speed to the turn and did not offer a late bid
in the stretch. ARNO'S MANE MAN chased the pace from a four wide path on the turn and did not mount a late rally. STREET MOXIE was away alertly and
tracked the early fast fractions while outside of rivals, lost ground along the turn and tired in the drive. STONE GROOVE was up close in the early going,
pressed the pace along the turn while three wide and faded in the stretch run.
