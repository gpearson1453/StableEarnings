Footnotes
RULER OF ANGELS settled off of the early pace, improved position while two wide approaching the quarter-marker, closed the gap on JUNGLE ROAR
inside of the furlong marker and wore that foe down in the final sixteenth to prevail. JUNGLE ROAR pressed the pace from a two wide path through the
second turn, overtook the tiring pacesetter heading into the stretch, was on the left lead when confronted by RULER OF ANGELS and could not hold that
one off and was outfinished while besting the rest. SPOONLEY rushed up to stalk the pace leaving the clubhouse turn, gave a bit of ground to the top pair
on the second turn while three wide, could not keep up entering the stretch run and was outkicked in the drive. RICH WARRIOR was sent to set the
fractions through the backstretch run, was confronted by JUNGLE ROAR nearing the top of the stretch, stayed on within aim nearing the furlong marker and
weakened in the late going. TRUTH TO POWER stalked the pace through the second turn and gave way in the stretch run. BUBBLES IS ON FIRE was a bit
rank and hard to place on the first turn while two wide, settled off of the pace through the backstretch run while saving ground and gave out in the late
stages.

Footnotes
ALISO BEACH settled off of the pace outside of rivals while in hand through the backstretch run, swung widest for the drive, was coaxed along in the final
furlong and had a late push to get by the tiring runner-up to preavil. RUN FOR MY HONEY was four wide on the first turn while pressing the pace, took the
lead along the second turn while two wide, had a clear lead nearing the furlong marker but was tiring in the final stages and was caught by the winner while
clear of the rest. SHAMAN'S PRODIGY broke in a bit at the start and settled off of the pace, gained ground while two wide between foes on the far turn and
was outfinished by the top two in the stretch run, while staying on to be a clear third. CONFIDENCE BUILDER was hustled to dispute the early pace, yielded
the lead to AVERY ON POINTE along the first turn then stalked the pace through the second turn, gave ground into the stretch run and weakened in the
final stages. DASHING DEMI tracked the pace outside of rivals into the second turn, gained ground along the second turn to come within range and gave
way in the stretch run. AVERY ON POINTE was hustled leaving the break to dispute the early pace, shook free of CONFIDENCE BUILDER leaving the first
turn, felt pressure from RUN FOR MY HONEY along the backstretch run, relinquished the lead nearing the quarter-marker and gave out in the drive.

OUR BOLD PRINCE tracked the pace inside of foes through the turn, closed on the runner-up inside of the furlong marker and kicked clear in the end.
MOHAWK KING (IRE) was sent leaving the break to set quick fractions from the inside, had a clear lead inside of the furlong marker but was caught by the
winner in the final sixteenth while besting the rest. KNOCKOUT BERT pressed the quick pace from a two wide path on the turn and was outkicked in the
stretch run. HANDSOME GARY chased the pace outside of foes through the turn and finished evenly in the stretch drive. FOSTER BOI tracked the pace
outside of rivals on the turn, lost ground into the stretch and did not offer a late bid. OUR EXPECTATION was a bit slow into stride in the early stages, was
three wide on the turn and did not rally in the stretch run. CASHLINGS chased the pace into the turn while saving ground and faded in the stretch.

BLUEBERRY EYES tracked the pace outside of foes through the second turn, gained ground while three wide into the stretch run, found a stubborn foe in
SACRED BEAUTY, was firmly hand-urged and while never able to shake free from that foe was able to prevail in a drive. SACRED BEAUTY was hustled to
dispute the early pace, cleared along the first turn, set moderately fast fractions into the second turn while saving ground, was headed leaving the second
turn and battled back against the winner but could not reel her in in the end while clear of the rest. MAGGIE FITZGERALD settled just off of the early pace
while inside of rivals, improved position along the second turn, was outkicked by the top pair in the stretch run but kept on to secure the show. LOUD
FUSAICHI disputed the pace along the first turn, stalked the pace through the backstretch run, closed on the leader to vie for the lead nearing the furlong
grounds but was outfinished in the lat going. THISONESFORBARRY settled off of the pace, traveled three wide between foes through the backstretch run,
was in tight along the second turn and lacked a final kick in the stretch run. KITTYBE QUICK was a bit rank and hard to place along the first turn, settled
outside of foes along the backstretch run, was four wide on the second turn and did not rally in the stretch.

Footnotes
SPEEDING STYLE was away well and was sent to show early speed while setting the pace, extended the lead along the turn and drew clear in the end.
LEMON ZINGER hopped at the start and was away a bit slowly, chased the pace outside of rivals on the turn and was no match for the winner in the late
going but kept on to claim the place. MR BOTANICALS lagged a bit in the early going, improved position from a three wide path on the turn and was
outfinished while on the left lead in the stretch run. UNION BLISS stalked the pace from the second flight and weakened in the stretch run. ALARMING
MOMENT tracked the pace outside of foes through the turn and tired in the stretch. PATH TO PARADISE chased the pace in the early going, saved ground
on the turn, was asked for run leaving the turn while still in aim and gave way in the drive. U S TALE stalked the pace while two wide between rivals and
faded in the late going.

Footnotes
JAN JAN CAN was a bit slow in the early going and settled toward the rear inside of rivals, was two wide on the turn, waited for racing room nearing the
furlong-marker, found a seam in the final sixteenth and surged in the last stages to prevail. BARBARIUS stalked the pace from the inside, swung out for the
drive, headed RUN LIKE KONA nearing the sixteenth-marker and gained the lead into the late going but was outfinished by the winner in the final strides,
while holding for second. RUN LIKE KONA was sent to set the fractions from a ground saving position while being pressed, was able to shake free of the
pressing rival inside of the furlong marker but was caught inside of the final sixteenth and was outfinished by the top two. CLOCHARD STREET stalked the
pace inside of foes through the turn, lost ground into the stretch and lacked a final bid in the drive. SHARP CURVE pressed the pace from a two wide path
through the turn, continued to be within range inside of the furlong marker and weakened in the late stages. PERFECT EDITION stalked the pace outside of
foes through the turn and tired in the stretch run. AFTER SUNDOWN chased the pace outside of foes through the turn and gave way in the stretch drive.

DRUMADOON stalked the pace outside of foes on the turn, gained ground on the tiring pacesetter to take the lead into the stretch run, was kept to task
through the lane and held to prevail. BETTER TOMORROW chased the pace inside of foes along the turn, angled out nearing the furlong marker, pressured
DRUMADOON inside of the final sixteenth while on the left lead, lost action in the final strides prior to the wire and was vanned off. MIZZEN POWER saved
ground while tracking the pace through the turn, mounted an inside rally in the final furlong and was outfinished in the late going. PHILIPIE FAST settled off
of the early pace while inside of foes, closed well leaving the turn, could not keep pace with the top pair in the final sixteenth and was outfinished and took
up at the finish line to avoid the runner who lost action. LUCKY CHAMP was away slowly and showed no early speed, was two wide on the turn and while
not able to impact the leaders rallied well in the late going. SMILING PATRICK was away alertly and set the pace while three wide through the turn, was
confronted nearing the top of the stretch and weakened in the stretch run. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE
FINISH INVOLVING BETTER TOMORROW LOSING ACTION AND RULED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF
FINISH STEMMING FROM THAT INCIDENT.

Footnotes
IMA HAPPY CAT stalked the pace outside of rivals, gained ground along the turn, confronted the tiring pacesetter heading into the lane, was firmly urged
through the final sixteenth and just lasted over an oncoming runner-up. SQUARED SHADY saved ground while sitting off of the early pace, gained ground
along the rail inside of the furlong marker and continued that run to pressure the winner in the final strides but just missed for the win while clear for the
place. GO SMILEY GO chased the pace inside of rivals through the turn, swung out for the drive and closed well to get up in time to secure third.
GRINNINGEARTOEAR stalked the pace from the second flight while outside of rivals and lacked a late kick in the stretch run. MIDNIGHT FLOWER was
unhurried through the turn while inside of foes and closed willingly in the stretch drive. LOTSA PEPPER pressed the early pace while three deep between
foes, gave a bit of ground heading into the stretch and weakened while on the left lead in the final stages. GAYLES EVENING was away alertly and set
quick fractions while being pressured, was confronted leaving the turn and gave way in the stretch run. TONI TWO POCKET pressed the pace into the turn,
was four wide between foes on the turn, dropped back approaching the quarter-marker and faded in the drive.

SMOKINHOTREDHEAD was unhurried through the early going while outside of foes, gained ground from a five wide position on the second turn, was set
down for the drive and determinedly got up in time to prevail in a blanket finish. RED DAHLIA was away in good order and set the pace while rating nicely,
was headed by FANTASTIC SECRET leaving the second turn, dueled with that foe inside of the final furlong, was all out in the end and was nipped on the
wire by the winner while holding for second. FANTASTIC SECRET was forwardly placed while tracking the pace through the backstretch run, gained ground
while three wide on the second turn, confronted RED DAHLIA nearing the quarter-marker, dueled with that foe inside of the sixteenth-marker and was
tagged by SMOKINHOTREDHEAD in the final strides, while just missing the nod for place. FIRE DIAMONDS stalked the pace from the second flight while
inside of rivals, gained a bit of ground on the second turn and finished evenly in the stretch run. BREAKING THE CODE stalked the pace from the midflight
while outside of rivals, gained ground while four deep on the second turn but could not continue that run and flattened out in the stretch drive. FRIEND OF
AUTISM saved all of the ground while settling toward the rear of the field and did not mount a late rally. AMERICAN ROYALTY stalked the pace from an
inside path and gave way in the stretch run. PULPIT SINGER stalked the pace through the backstretch run, steadied between rivals nearing the
three-eighths marker and faded in the stretch run.
