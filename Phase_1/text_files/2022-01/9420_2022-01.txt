Footnotes
SUPERTALEOFHOUDINI laid close up inside of a pace setting VICIOUS VELMA into the first turn, got keen when asked to alter course outside of that rival
around that bend, pulled to bid for the lead two wide entering the backstretch, vied before leading into the far turn, cleared approaching the three furlong
pole, and held sway as her inner counterpart re-challenged through the lane. VICIOUS VELMA set the pace, vied inside of SUPERTALEOFHOUDINI down
the backstretch, failed to keep pace with that foe into the far turn, but kept on turning for home, attempted a re-bid inside of that rival approaching
midstretch, but was kept at bay, and proved second best. SURREY tracked from the two path, moved up to a stalking position passing the three quarter
pole, then chased the clear leader under steady urging around the far turn, and sustained stride through the lane for a minor reward. JUDY'S DESIGN
tracked three to four wide around the first turn, but failed to keep pace with the leading group down the backstretch, came under a drive into the far turn, but
only offered a mild response. HERO'S DAUGHTER stalked along the inside into the first turn, pulled turning into the backstretch, slightly steadied off heels
while shifting three wide at the seven sixteenths pole, then chased three wide around the far turn before tiring through the lane. FACE CARD CONTESSA
showed little.

Footnotes
CRUSADER EXPRESS took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, set the pace along the inside, inched clear of her pressing stable-mate entering
the lane, and lasted safely from an outer rival late. CUSTOM KAT tracked the pace, shifted three wide entering the lane, and stayed on, but did not have
enough to catch the leader despite cutting into her margin late. GALLANT STAR bumped an inner foe at the start, pressed the leader from the outside, but
failed to keep pace entering the lane, chased thereafter, but lost place at the furlong grounds. VON DOM chased along the inside, but tired through the lane.
MISS JENNY'S HALO broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, then was outrun.

Footnotes
SHIPPINGPORT established a loose lead early on, widened his advantage into the far turn, drifted out to the center of the track through the final furlong
while well clear, and held sway under very confident handling. MR. QUALITY took a bump from an inner foe while being forced outwardly by that rival at the
start, stalked two wide, and was second best. ONE TIME GEM raced off of the pace along the inside, shifted out entering the backstretch, took the far turn
three wide at the rear, and moved up around that bend without threatening. COLOR FAST never got involved. SHAR'S TREASURE broke outwardly and
bumped a foe, stalked the loose leader along the inside, but weakened after a half mile.

PERFECTURE stalked three wide, bid outside of a leading CHAMBLISS at the five sixteenths pole, battled with that foe through the lane, and edged clear in
the final sixteenth. MY GUITAR trailed along the inside around the first turn, came under urging while off of the pace into the far turn, cut the corner turning
for home, gained along the rail through upper stretch to claim show, then tipped outside of the leading pair at the sixteenth pole, and reached place late.
CHAMBLISS set the pace along the inside, met PERFECTURE's bid at the five sixteenths pole, dueled with that foe through the lane, but yielded entering
the final sixteenth, and was caught for place approaching the wire. SEMI CHARMED LIFE bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked from the two path
around the first turn, but was steadied by the rider when getting too close to the leaders at the thirteen-sixteenths pole, shifted three wide around the far
turn, then hung on his left lead through the lane before passing a tiring foe for a minor reward in the final furlong. WILD FIREMAKER bumped with an inner
foe at the start, pressed the pace two wide and between horses, came under a drive into the far turn, failed to keep pace with those rivals turning for home,
and tired in upper stretch. READY REDDING tracked from the four to three path around the first turn, but faded into the far turn. BOLD ZARB rushed the
gate a bit pre-race, then raced at the rear in the four to three path around the first turn, and was outrun.

TOTAL MALICE set the pace, vied inside of PRINCESS RENEE around the far turn, but shook clear at the quarter pole, and inched further away through
the lane. COLD HEARTED WENCH solidly bumped an outer foe at the start, stalked the top pair along the inside, shifted outside of those foes into the far
turn, ranged up turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the inner leader while sparking a duel for place at the quarter pole, then prevailed for that
position entering the final sixteenth. PRINCESS RENEE firmly bumped an inner foe at the start, pressed the pace two wide, vied around the far turn, but
proved no match for her inner counterpart entering the lane as COLD HEARTED WENCH bid for place, dueled with that rival for that position through
midstretch, but was bested a sixteenth out. J Z'S FIRST was sandwiched between horses at the start, raced off of the pace three to two wide, and failed to
factor. NOFANSINTHESTANDS saved ground off of the pace, improved to midpack into the far turn, chased under urging around that bend, but tired
through the lane. VEILAZIG outrun. BABY MAYBE tracked the pace two wide, but faded three wide around the far turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
ORDER FOR PORKY stalked the dueling pair from just off, pressed outside of those foes around the far turn, bid entering the lane, led at the three
sixteenths pole, and gamely held from bidding foes on either side in the late stages. MY BARILEY settled far off of the fast pace two wide, gained four wide
and outside of foes around the far turn, shifted five wide in upper stretch, rallied outside of foes to bid at the furlong grounds, but was kept at bay, and saved
place from his inner stablemate. ZANESVILLE took up soon after the start from a bit of tight quarters, lagged well behind the field into the far turn, narrowed
the gap turning for home, then rallied along the rail through the lane in hopes of producing a late bid, but did not have enough to catch the leader, and
missed place. DANVILLE saved ground off of the pace, gained on the top two around the far turn as the leaders tired, but waited racing room behind traffic
at the five sixteenths pole, remained blocked behind the leaders before shifting four wide and between horses at the three-sixteenths, but found other foes
had gotten jumps, and chased those rivals home. TAKAFUMI (BRZ) dueled inside of SHAKE SOME ACTION through a fast pace, and weakened in the two
path in upper stretch. SHAKE SOME ACTION dueled for the lead two wide through a collapsing pace, and weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SCARY LARRY stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the clearing leader entering the lane, ranged up to that foe at the furlong grounds, then dueled
before forging an advantage late. STEELY DANZA set the pace along the inside, shook clear at the quarter pole, dug in at the furlong grounds as SCARY
LARRY menaced, dueled with that foe thereafter, but was bested late. EL MIC TIESUN broke slowly and trailed the field, swung four to five wide entering
the lane, and stayed on to claim show at the furlong pole. COACH HUDSON bobbled out and bumped a foe at the start knocking himself off stride, raced
forwardly placed two wide and between horses, but only managed to chase the leading pair entering the lane before fading. OXBOW WIND was pinched
back while taking significant bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, raced off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path at the five
sixteenths pole before cutting the corner entering the lane, and lacked a bid thereafter. YOUKILLINMECAT bumped with an inner foe at the start, prompted
the pace two wide, and faded entering the lane. COAL TOWN ROAD chased the pace three wide and weakened turning for home.
