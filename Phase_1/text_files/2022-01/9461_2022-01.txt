Footnotes
CUPID'S GHOST ducked out a bit at the start, was hustled to join the pace outside foes racing into the first turn, went clear entering the backstretch, then
held sway throughout while being kept to firm encouragement. HICKORY COURT, reserved last to the backstretch, came around foes racing into the stretch
and prevailed for the place honors late. ROJO TORO was rated off the second flight near the inside, saved ground to upper stretch and improved position
inside foes late. BROADWAY RUCKUS stumbled at the start, was settled between foes tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch and never
menaced thereafter. GIVE IT A GO angled to the inside tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance entering the far turn but steadily faded nearing the lane. CAPTURED DREAMS switched outside foes racing to the backstretch, was urged to
advance three deep on the leader entering the far turn but came up empty nearing upper stretch. HEAVY WEIGHT was urged disputing the pace inside the
eventual winner through the first turn to the backstretch, then gave way between foes racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
BELLARIFIC, in touch prompting a rival's pace from the outset into the turn, took over leaving the quarter mile marker, kicked away under firm
encouragement and was taken in hand at the wire. GRAND MAMOO shied outwards at the start crossing into the path of BE BOP A LOLA while bumping
that rival, was collected quickly to make pursuit of the leaders along the inside racing into the turn, tipped out racing into upper stretch and continued with a
steady effort to prove best of the others. BE BOP A LOLA, bumped, then squeezed at the start, was collected to track off the second flight racing into the
turn, angled four wide nearing upper stretch and continued well enough to gain a share. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE ducked out at the start, was righted, then
urged along the inside disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn and gave way in the drive. CASANOVA QUEEN tracked off the first flight
outside a rival racing to the turn, shifted out three deep nearing upper stretch but offered no rally. SHANGHAI KIMMY drifted outwards a bit at the start, was
settled into stride racing well off the inside early and never proved a serious threat. JARA broke slowly and never menaced thereafter.

Footnotes
TIZ LOTTIE was urged setting the pace on a clear margin between foes racing well off the inside racing to the backstretch, held sway on a comfortable
margin through the far turn to upper stretch and was kept to pressure. AMERICAN EMPRESS was urged prompting the pacesetter along the inside racing
to the first turn, switched outside that rival entering the backstretch, continued with a steady bid in the three, then four path racing into the stretch but
couldn't gain terms with that foe while proving best of the others. UPPER SPEED DS raced unhurried along the inside dropping well off the leaders racing to
the backstretch, saved ground to the lane and continued with an effort to improve position. MAY BEAU, cut off at the start, settled near the inside racing to
the backstretch and passed inside some tiring rivals racing into the stretch. C'EST PARTI ducked in sharply at the start, then switched outside rivals racing
to the backstretch dropping well off the pace and offered no rally. MALIBU LIFE was urged to a forward placing three deep pursuing the pacesetter into the
backstretch but steadily faded after a half. PASS THE SALSA, caught four wide racing to the backstretch while being prompted to contend, retreated early.

Footnotes
TONY SMALL angled to the rail while tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance in the opening quarter, saved ground to upper stretch gathering
momentum, tipped out racing past midstretch and wrested the advantage in time under firm handling. CREEKMORE was urged to the lead a bit off the rail
racing through the backstretch, dictated the pace to upper stretch while shifting inside in the closing stages and couldn't fend off the winner. MAGICAL
TALE, forwardly placed along the inside in the opening stages, switched outside the leader continuing in pursuit of that foe three wide into the lane but
lacked the needed final kick. DOODLE HOPPER tracked off the second flight while coming under some pressure to maintain contention racing into the
bend, shifted inside foes entering the stretch and continued with an effort to gain some position. NICK THE CARDSHARK switched out three wide in early
tracking the leaders outside the eventual winner racing into the turn, continued in pursuit outside foes to upper stretch but proved empty in the drive.
BERHANU stumbled at the start dislodging his rider from his irons and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CARPENTERS CALL, forwardly placed stalking the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, advanced to press the issue on the far turn, took over leaving the
quarter mile marker and made the balance of the pace under firm encouragement. ST. JOE LOUIS (GB) tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight
racing to the backstretch, continued with a steady advance to loom outside the winner racing into the stretch but failed to gain terms with that rival while
proving best of the others. FEBRUARY SON reserved between foes from out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance a bit
off the inside racing into the far turn, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a mild bid while prevailing for a share. SEVEN
CHANNELS, reserved inside rivals racing to the backstretch, gained some position along the inside entering the far turn, tipped off the rail racing into upper
stretch and finished evenly late. MR. KRINGLE, outpaced in early stages, came around foes racing into the far turn to gain some position but made no real
impact. PIRATE PARADE, urged along the inside setting the pace on a narrow margin racing to the backstretch, dueled for command inside the winner
through the far turn and gave way into the stretch. COMMENCE settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and never mounted a serious challenge.
ABUMPINTHEROAD tracked the leaders along the inside as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch and gave way entering the far turn.

PEACEFUL SURPRISE was rated outside foes racing to the backstretch dropping well off the second flight after a half, angled to the rail racing into the far
turn while being prompted to advance, saved ground through that bend while moving readily into contention, tipped outside TAKE A STAND leaving the
furlong marker and wrested command from that foe in time under firm handling. The latter, forwardly placed attending a rival's pace under light rating in the
opening half, pressed that foe on the far turn to gain the advantage with a quarter mile to go, was roused clear into upper stretch while shifting to the inside
but couldn't contain the winner's late bid. LATIN NIKKITA angled inwards racing through the first turn to gain a position between rivals tracking off the first
flight after a half, was prompted to advance in tandem with several rivals racing into the far turn, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch and
prevailed for a share while proving no match for the top pair. AULENTI, urged inside a rival setting the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the
backstretch, dueled for command inside that foe into the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. APPALACHIANHEIGHTS tracked off the first flight along
the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance on the second bend, tipped off the inside nearing upper stretch but quickly emptied out.
WINGSPUN switched out three deep racing to the backstretch tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, was prompted to maintain contention nearing
the second bend but steadily faded on the far turn. CHROME SAVAGE, reserved well off the second flight racing to the backstretch, offered no rally.

Footnotes
POSEIDON'S PASSION, in touch with the leaders from the outset three deep prompting the pace, pressed the issue in that path into upper stretch, then
continued outside a rival contesting the issue to late stages and gamely prevailed under firm handling. SISTER RULER was rated just off the leaders in the
opening stages while angled to the inside after the opening furlong, was prompted to advance along the rail racing into the turn, came through inside the
leaders when presented an opening in upper stretch to challenge for command, continued in a protracted skirmish for the lead to the final stages but was
just outfinished. BILLYJANE, off slowly, was prompted to gain some position between foes just behind the second flight racing into the turn, split foes while
shifting out three deep racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap while gaining a share. SILVER TUNES was urged disputing the
pace inside foes from the outset while angling to the rail in the opening stages, dueled inside foes racing into the turn, shifted a bit off the rail nearing upper
stretch contesting the issue between foes but gave way leaving the furlong marker. PROPER MANNERS was rated between foes in the opening stages
dropping off the second flight, angled to the inside nearing the bend, saved ground to upper stretch but offered no rally. MOANAS POWER angled inwards
to prompt the pace between foes racing through the backstretch into the turn and emptied out nearing upper stretch. TRIPLET, forwardly placed four wide
racing just off the first flight in the opening stages, continued three deep into the turn, swung out five wide nearing upper stretch but offered no rally.
BOURBON GAL was under pressure early pursuing the leaders along the inside in the opening stages but was soon outpaced.

Footnotes
SHINNECOCK HILLS was settled in hand between foes in the opening stages, switched out four wide on the backstretch, made a steady rally to contention
in that path racing through the turn, swung out five wide in upper stretch while being roused to challenge leaving midstretch, gained a clear advantage
between calls and just held MACALLAN to the end in an all out drive. The latter was settled outside foes racing three deep on the backstretch, gradually
gained contention between rivals nearing upper stretch, shifted out six wide entering the lane and produced his best stride late to challenge the winner at the
wire. GIANT'S FIRE raced in close quarters five deep between foes in the opening stages, shifted inwards to track between foes nearing the turn, angled to
the rail midway through the bend while being prompted to advance, came through inside foes nearing upper stretch to gain a brief advantage between calls
but proved no match for the top pair late. BALLOT BOX, urged inside foes through the backstretch disputing the pace, tipped a bit off the rail dueling for
command outside a rival into upper stretch and gave way. EXXEL ducked out at the start, was righted, then urged to join the leaders while angling inwards
to press the issue three wide into the bend, then gave way between foes into the lane. BRUCE BANNER, urged between foes disputing the pace from the
outset into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. CHROME'S RIGHT switched out four wide in early stages while being urged in pursuit of the leaders into
the bend and gave way after a half. MENELAO settled inside foes in the opening stages and never gained contention. MEAN JOE BRO angled to the inside
early while making brief pursuit of the leaders through the backstretch but emptied out early. PROFESSOR J broke awkwardly and never gained contention.

Footnotes
FORBIDDEN DREAM, reserved between foes racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch and produced a stout rally to reel in
SHE'S JUST QUALITY in time with a determined effort to prevail under firm handling. The latter was urged to the lead along the inside leaving the chute,
dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the second bend, responded to maintain the advantage past midstretch but couldn't contain the winner's final
bid. BRAMBLE BUSH angled to the rail in early stages tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, then
came under pressure to advance inside foes racing into the lane but made no real headway while prevailing for a share. FIRST LADY DI DA tracked off the
second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance but finished evenly in
late stages. TWELVE RED ROSES tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance on the pacesetter three
wide after a half, prompted that foe through the far turn to upper stretch but proved empty in the drive. STARSHIP MISSION was rated off the second flight
inside foes racing to the far turn but offered no rally. PRETTY DEVIL, urged to forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the first turn, faded
between rivals after a half. CECI'SAPRILHOTTIE hopped at the start, was reserved last to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch
and failed to make an impression while finishing in hand through the final furlong. PHONE A FRIEND, reserved while angling to the inside leaving the chute,
saved ground to the far turn but offered no response when called upon to advance. AS IT SEEMS, bumped at the start, raced wide to the backstretch and
dropped out of contention early.
