Footnotes
BATTLE OF BERLIN vied early outside, eased back, rallied clear into the stretch and lasted under steady urging. DOCTOR DOOM lacked speed inside,
moved very wide into the stretch and closed well. KODAPENDENT broke a step slowly, split foes on the turn and continued well to the finish. MY
BROTHER NEIL saved ground within range then flattened out in the stretch. STARSHIP GOTHAM settled just off the leaders outside, made a brief bid on
the turn then tired. EIGHT DANZAS dueled early, drew away into the far turn then proved empty by the quarter pole. LA LA LUCY trailed throughout losing
contact with her field.

SPEIGHTSTER'S GOLD in the final furlong, dug in gamely and was up late for the win. SPEIGHTSTER'S GOLD raced four wide early, then stalked outside,
bid three wide entering the far turn, rallied to the front, edged away turning for home, then dug in gamely and battled on to the end. BELLAMY'SPARTYGIRL
vied inside for the lead, briefly shook free, dueled midway on the far turn, weakened in the lane and held for the show spot. SHARON'S LAW tracked on the
inside, chased inside on the far turn, lacked a rally and finished evenly. OUI MADAME raced two wide off the pace and bested the others. SHES
EUPHORIC raced off the pace and did not factor. IOVA raced off the pace inside, faded and never factored. ALLEGRETTO raced off the rail, off the pace

Footnotes
AUSTIN WHYLIE raced off the pace, made a four wide middle move into contention, bid on the far turn, rallied outside of MAJESTIC SKY turning for home,
wore down that rival and pulled away under urging. MAJESTIC SKY vied inside for the lead, shook free on the backside, responded when roused, dueled
with the winner in upper stretch, dug in and came up second best. LOULOVESTHERIVER had a three wide trip off the pace, rallied mildly outside in the
lane and got up for the show spot. WILL TAKE CONTROL raced off the pace, chased the leaders on the far turn and then weakened. NO TOLERANCE was
bumped at the start, raced off the pace between rivals, saved ground on the far turn and lacked a rally. ENANO raced off the pace inside and did not factor.
FACTUM LOVE STYLE was bumped at the start, raced three wide early and was outrun. RICKIE'S MELODY tracked the leaders in the early stages, then
chased and gave way. MR. SHENANIGANS raced four wide early, vied outside for the lead, then chased, gave way and stopped in the lane.

DIVINE MIRACLE saved ground behind the dueling leaders then rallied clear through the final furlong under a steady drive. RACK GIN made a three wide
bid to the front near the quarter pole then led to the final sixteenth just holding on for the place. CANT STOP THIS MAN dueled along the inside and
continued gamely to the finish. PERFECT REVENGE bobbled badly just after the start, made a menacing wide move on the turn then flattened out.
EXCURSION dropped far behind then closed the gap without menacing. THE BIG GREY broke slowly, chased wide and failed to threaten. MAINE dueled in
the two path for three furlongs and faltered. DON'T RECALL trailed along the inside and was always outrun. GREYZER saved ground off the leaders and
began stopping on the turn.

NONEEDTOWORRY trailed early, circled his field on the final turn and pulled away while kept to his business. VINE JET prompted the pace between rivals,
steadied slightly at the quarter pole when passed by the winner and continued gamely. UNCLE IRISH steadied on the first turn, forced the pace the steadied
slightly at the quarter pole. FLORIDA GATOR settled outside the leaders, moved inside on the final turn and lacked a rally. NOSTALGIC RUN vied outside
then inside, and weakened at the quarter pole. MISCHIEF ROAD lacked speed and was never in contention. EGOT A POKER FACE steadied in tight on the
first turn, moved closer before the half then faltered. DANGNABBIT flashed speed inside then stopped abruptly and was eased. MIKE J dueled briefly inside
then stopped abruptly and was eased in the stretch. An objection by the runner-up against the winner for interference at the quarter pole was dismissed.

furlong, dug in gamely on the rail and prevailed late. DIESEL showed good early speed to set the pace, shook free on the turn, raced off the inside entering
the stretch, responded when challenged and dug in gamely outside of BARILKO to the finish. WEEKEND IN COURT was off a bit slow, trailed the field,
moved up at the quarter pole, came four wide into the stretch and rallied late outside for third. MISSION WRAPITUP chased inside, chased on the turn,
finished evenly in the stretch and held on for fourth. GOLDENLINEOF raced off the pace, came four wide into the lane and rallied mildly between horses.
