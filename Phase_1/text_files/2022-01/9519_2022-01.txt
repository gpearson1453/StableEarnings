Footnotes
SECRET PRIZE stalked the top pair down the backstretch, moved up five to six wide through the upper stretch and edged clear late under strong handling.
COLOROFACLOUD was forwardly placed down the backstretch, was ridden well off the inside through the upper lane and couldn't match strides with the
winner through the drive to finish second best. HUMMIN' THE FUNK was unhurried early on, moved up four wide around the far turn and made a good late
gain. BIRTHDAY WISH stalked the pace from the outside, raced five wide near the quarter pole and had no final winning bid. TIKTOKNAWAY was allowed
to settle off the early pace, moved up near the inside around the far turn through the lane and had not enough. BELLSWILLBERINGING was slow early on,
raced five wide around the far turn, raced widest through the lane and never was a factor. CELESTIAL DIVA was allowed to settle to middle of the pack
early and failed to respond. KITTEN'S BLESSING was slow early on and never threatened. BIZZY BIZZY was quick to begin to set the early pace and tired
readily.

BEHIND THE COUCH, under a snug hold off the early pace, moved up three wide around the far turn, angled five to six wide through the upper stretch and
finished well to be clear under strong handling. COMBAT QUEEN stalked the early pace, race near the inside around the far turn, led inside the eighth pole
couldn't hold off the winner in the latter stages to finish second best. BOURBON WILDCAT was quick to begin to take the early lead while racing in hand,
raced off the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. JOURNEYTOTHEMOON bore out sharply at the break, corrected and was allowed to settle
early, raced five wide through the upper stretch and had no late rally. LUCRE dropped back early, raced four wide around the far turn, angled in late and
had no response. FACTOR IN stalked the pace while racing three wide and tired.

speed to set the early pace, raced near the four wide path through the stretch, led near the sixteenth pole and was caught late in a game effort. DR. GRANT
stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide near the quarter pole and kept on to the wire. RIDICULOUS was allowed to settle early, raced six to
seven wide through the stretch and had not enough. DONTCROSSFUZZY was forwardly placed to lay up close in the early stages, raced five wide into the
upper stretch and weakened late. B B BAD was unhurried early, raced four wide through the far turn and had no response. DONTFORGETTOBLINK settled
off the early pace, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and never was a factor. HEAVENLY TRIP was sent along to show good early speed and gave
way.

towards the back of the pack early, moved up widest through the lane and had not enough. LOTTACLASS LILSASS settled off the early pace, raced five
wide through the far turn and had no response. MISS SEDUCTIVE broke in at the start, bumped with Party Monster, raced five wide around the far turn and
never threatened. HOLY PINK was unhurried in the early stages, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and never was a factor. SUPERIORITY was
bumped at the break, raced near the inside around the far turn through the upper stretch and never threatened. CIVIL UNREST stalked the pace and failed
