Footnotes
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT was briefly fractious in the gate, came away in good order and raced off the top pair entering the turn, coaxed four wide into the lane,
cleared command in the upper stretch and finished going away. IT BEAST ALL raced outside off the early pace, was ridden along three to four wide into the
stretch run, responded under pressure and steadily gained through the lane. GOGEES vied three deep for the early lead, briefly sat off the leader then
advanced to duel midway through the turn, held a slight edge entering top stretch, got collared by the winner and weakened to show. TAPATERM raced
inside near midpack entering the turn, hustled along two wide into the lane, remained in contention but lacked the needed kick for serious impact.
SINGINTHRUTHESTORM saved ground through the turn, tipped out a path wider for the drive and lacked a needed rally. EL CARDINAL vied inside for the
early lead, briefly cleared on top then came back under pressure midway through the turn, fought back at the head of the lane then gave way. VOLTE FACE
was fractious in the gate and came away slowly at the start, remained reserved off the pace, raced along the outside into the lane and never threatened.
TRINNI SURPRISE saved ground throughout and failed to move into close contention. LAGERFELDT raced near mid-range through early stages and
steadily weakened through the turn. CHARLEMAGNERETURNS vied between foes in the opening quarter and retreated.

Footnotes
WEIGHT OF GLORY set the pace in the two path, widened in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. TIZ ROMANTIC settled off the early pace outside,
advanced three wide around the turn and finished willingly. ZIP LINE TO HEAVEN was bumped at the start, steadied soon after, raced off the pace two
wide, swung five wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and just missed second. LOYAL LOUIE chased the pace two wide, angled four wide near the
quarter pole and had a mild rally between foes. THE GREAT OZ was in range inside and lacked a rally. LORD DARNLEY was off slow, raced well back
three wide and had some belated gain. HIGH YIELD KITTEN lacked early speed, raced three wide around most of the turn, switched to the right lead and
drifted six wide nearing the quarter pole and was no threat in the lane. AWESOME PUDDING bumped with ZIP LINE TO HEAVEN at the start, prompted the
pace two wide and came up empty in the lane. HE'S ROYALTY was outrun inside.

Footnotes
PARTNER'S HOPE pressed STRIBLING from inside early, let that one go entering the turn, moved off the rail to rebid between horses approaching the top
of the stretch, took over once straightened away and drew off under a drive. ROGERS GINGER saved ground in midpack for three furlongs, shifted to the
two-path in the stretch and finished willingly between horses for the place. POLSAR trailed two wide to the stretch, moved to the rail leaving the furlong
grounds and offered a mild response to snag the show. JULIUS THE GREAT tracked the pace three wide to the top of the lane, and weakened. MIDNIGHT
TEQUILA raced two wide around the turn, and lacked a closing response. THEREGOESMYMIRACLE broke a step slow, and failed to factor while four wide.
STRIBLING vied early outside PARTNER'S HOPE, cleared off on the turn and moved inside, could not cope with the latter turning for home and retreated.
PIYPA DE LYNDA was finished early three wide.

Footnotes
GLOUCESTER was forwardly placed and three wide entering the turn, loomed a threat to the leader late on the turn, roused forward and took command in
the upper stretch and finished going away. KLUGMAN ranged up closer moving through the turn, coaxed two to three wide into stretch run, sustained a
steady bid and gained place. CALCULATED BREEZE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held firm through the turn, got collared by the winner in
the upper stretch and weakened to show. BATTER UP BUD hustled along three wide into the turn, stayed on four to five wide through the lane and needed
more for late impact. HOORAYHOORAYHOORAY raced inside through early stages, tipped three wide turning for home and lacked a needed rally. HEY
HOMBRE raced near mid-range four wide entering the turn then weakened turning for home. STONE AGE raced off the pace, came four wide into the lane
and never threatened. DR. CERFOLIO raced two to three wide and steadily retreated. MISCHIEVOUS GUY broke in and bumped the side of the gate at the
start, remained five wide reserved in the back and had no response.

Footnotes
SOUPER LEGACY set the pace along the rail, dug in inside of BIRD WILCAT when that foe reached near even terms approaching the top of the stretch,
dueled inside of that foe through the lane while exchanging several light bumps and prevailed. BIRD WILDCAT stalked the winner two wide, reached near
even terms leaving the quarter pole, continued on the left lead through the lane, exchanged several bumps in the final furlong and just missed. PANORAMA
TRUCK stalked the pace from the rail and was one-paced through the lane to hold third. BIRDMAN RICHIE raced off the pace two wide between foes,
advanced three wide around the far turn but flattened out in the lane. THE SKIPPER TOO saved ground off the pace, angled out nearing the lane, angled
back to the rail in midstretch and never threatened. HEY PORTER chased the pace three and four wide and came up empty in the lane. THE TWINS
SNEAKERS trailed in the two path and was eased in the lane. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND HEARD AN
OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF BIRD WILDCAT AGAINST THE WINNER AND FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF
FINISH.

Footnotes
AMERICAN STARLET sprinted clear after the start, showed the way in the two-path to the stretch, and remained in command under a mild drive. BIG
INVASION hit the left side of the gate coming out, moved off the inside approaching the stretch with aim outside AMERICAN STARLET, could not seriously
threaten and settled for second best. VOCALIZE broke a step slow, saved ground throughout and rallied mildly into the lane to go clear of the remainder.
ICING chased two wide to the stretch, and lacked a closing bid. PRESUMPTIVE CLOSER broke a couple lengths slow, and never reached contention.
RAFF'S VENTURE broke a step slow, and was finished early outside. SWIFT DANCER pursued the pacesetter three wide to the end of the turn, and tired.
RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
BAHAMIAN RHAPSODY was forwardly placed behind the leader in opening stages, moved up to challenge for the lead near the quarter pole, cleared on
top in the upper stretch and held late under a driving finish. CHEROKEE CHATTER raced in range in the opening quarter, coaxed three wide into stretch
stretch, stayed on with response and steadily edged up closer to the wire. SHE'S CLASSY tracked the pace along the rail, came out a path turning for
home, sustained a steady bid near the inside in the final furlong and prevailed for a share. FOR EVER OURS got bumped at the start, was ridden along two
wide through the turn, came out wider for the drive, stayed on with interest but needed more for late impact. BONHEUR raced near midpack into the turn,
fanned out wide into the upper stretch and chased evenly in the final furlong. FILLMORE EAST raced three to four wide off the early pace, hustled up into
the lane and lacked a needed rally. SHEZA SAVAGE raced in contention three wide through the turn, fanned five wide into stretch run and failed to move
on. GREGS POSSE broke out and bumped rival at the start, was a bit tight two wide between in early stages, raced inside through the turn, tipped two wide
for the clear path near the furlong marker and failed to kick on. LADY MECHANIC lacked early speed, came four wide into the lane and failed to rally.
BROADWAY PEGGY saved ground throughout and had no response when called upon. BAHAMA PEARL cleared on top and angled over soon after the
start, vied for the lead with the winner at the quarter pole and came up empty in the upper stretch.

BALLERINA prompted the winner two wide, bid in upper stretch but was turned back in the final furlong. JOIN THE DOTS stalked the pace three wide, had
aim outside of the top two in upper stretch but was one-paced through the lane. TWILIGHT was up close inside, angled out nearing the lane, could not gain
on the top two and was outfinished for the show. ELUSIVE MOLLY bumped with FRANKIE'S GIRL at the start, raced three wide and failed to menace. MET

COLLABORATE was well rated and three wide in range going by the half mile marker, was ridden along two wide through the turn, raced in traffic in the
upper stretch, shifted four wide for a clear path, responded willingly under right-handed pressure and kicked clear. VIOLENT CITY sped to the lead and
angled inside soon after the start, vied inside a duo through the turn, battled back gamely along the rail into the lane, shook free to a slim lead then failed to
be a match when the winner swept by. CHOCOLATE BAR raced inside off the early pace, shifted out moving through the turn, swung six wide into the lane,
rallied along the outside and just missed place. BANK ON SHEA was forwardly placed in opening stages, vied two wide between foes around the turn,
remained in striking distance into the final furlong and weakened late. MUTASAABEQ bumped with COLLABORATE and steadied losing position in opening
stages, moved back up to race in striking distance near the half mile marker, vied three deep through the turn, continued to battle for the lead past the
furlong marker then gave way. SPUN AND WON tracked the pace in early stages, hustled up four wide late on the turn, stayed on with response in the
upper stretch then steadily weakened. WHERE PARADISE LAY raced up close along the rail, stayed inside through the turn, tipped out wider for the drive
and gave way. STRIKE APPEAL saved ground through the turn and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
CANELO sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace by a comfortable margin up the backstretch, held firm around the final turn, saved ground
into the lane and stayed sharp under steady encouragement. EAGLE CHIEF was unhurried and saved ground up the backstretch., shifted out and hustled
up late on the far turn, closed with response along the outside and captured place. GOLDEN INDY steadied along in opening stages and steadied into the
first turn, stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, launched a two wide bid around the far turn, sustained a steady bid in the lane and got edged for place
in final stride. TRUPIA rated inside up the backstretch, came three wide into the lane, chased on evenly in the final furlong and got vanned off after the race.
BIG ART settled through early stages, was ridden along the outside around the far turn, came five wide into the lane and had a mild improve. RAVE ON
broke in and bumped with rival at the start, raced in range up the backstretch, was ridden along two to three wide around the far turn then weakened past
upper stretch. NO DRAMA was unhurried through early stages, roused along the rail into the stretch run and lacked a needed rally. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE)
bumped with rival at the start, steadied around the first turn, rated three wide up the backstretch, hustled up around the far turn and faded in the upper
stretch. LUCKY LUCAS tracked the pace up the backstretch and steadily retreated. FRACTIONAL TIMES UNAVAILABLE, RACE WAS HAND TIMED, RUN
