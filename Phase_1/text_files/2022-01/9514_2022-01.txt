Footnotes
SWEET SURPRISE established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand three paths off the inside under some pressure through the
presence of a pair to the outside, tucked briefly to the two path into the turn and got out three wide at the seven-sixteenths pinching back RVALENTINA
mildly between foes at that station, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch under challenge dug in and was headed a
furlong out, dueled through to the finish taking back narrow command a sixteenth from home and prevailed gamely at the end. SOLID TUNE broke in at the
start bumping AFILADA, prompted the leader from the outside five then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six to seven wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive taking command a furlong out, dueled through to the finish getting headed a sixteenth from home, fought on to the wire
getting shaken off in the final jumps. AFILADA bumped at the start by SOLID TUNE breaking inwards, chased six then five wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung five then four wide straightened away into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. RVALENTINA broke in a step at the
start bumping SEALITHIC, prompted the pace four paths off the inside loosely between foes, tucked three wide into the turn, got pinched out lightly as
SWEET SURPRISE drifted out three wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and angled in to spin just off the inside into upper stretch, then
weakened in the drive. ET'S PREMONITION chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. SEALITHIC got bumped at the start by RVALENTINA, who broke inwards, grew detached at the tail
of the field two then three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
PRINCE JAMES was carried out at the start then angled in early, settled comfortably in third position, moved up outside the half-mile pole while inside of the
pacesetter, took the advantage with seven-sixteenths to run, shook clear along the rail at the five-sixteenths, extended the advantage while put to a drive
into upper stretch and widened under steady urging. CONFORMIST broke out while leaving the gate in front then was hustled, set the pace while well off
the inside, lost the advantage at the seven-sixteenths, went around the turn in mostly the three path, dropped back into upper stretch and proved no match
for the winner while just able to hold the place. CONFECTIONER was carried out at the start, settled well back in the field, was urged along in the two path
on the turn and just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show. DEMO DOCTOR was hustled while breaking alertly, chased the pace on the
outside then in the four path on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and tired then lost the trifecta. GREAT WORKOUT was carried out at the start, raced
at the rear while ridden along on the outside, went three wide on the turn, dropped to the two path into the stretch and failed to threaten. IRISH GIANT was
carried out at the start, raced on the outside while ridden along, went five wide on the turn and failed to respond.

IT'S TATI got bumped at the start by HORSESHOE FALLS, who broke outwards, prompted the leader from the outside in the three path, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide for home, proved no match while chasing the winner home well clear of the rest to be along second
best. BIG TONY'S GIRL bobbled at the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened. GAME THEORY five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and tired. LOT OF

Footnotes
MY COUSIN RICH was slow into stride, raced at the rear under urging, went two to three wide on the turn, was caught behind horses at the three-eighths,
rallied between foes at the three-sixteenths and closed well to get up late. MOTION TO STRIKE showed the way down the backstretch, went around the
turn in the two path, was set down into upper stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. ROMANTIC MAN
bumped with a foe shortly after the start, was urged along off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed response while able to get the show. MISTER J T settled on the inside while inside of an opponent, was hesitant while in tight against the rail from
the half-mile pole to the seven-sixteenths, moved from the inside to the two path at that point and was put to urging, shifted three wide late on the turn, was
driven five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. KENTUCKY KNIGHT was reluctant to load, raced on the outside under some urging, dropped from the
two path to the rail early on the turn and came up empty. WE READY broke a half-step slow then bumped with a rival, was urged along on the outside, went
four to five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. TOUGH WORKOUT chased then pressed the pace on the outside, vied in
the three path on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
HONEY MONEY dueled from the four path with DANCING KIKI to her inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn and came under
threat in tandem with her main pace rival from FROST ME to the outside, shook off DANCING KIKI at the five-sixteenths placed to coaxing confronted to the
outside, spun just off the inside into upper stretch on near even terms, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing threat from a pair
in the late stages and held gamely to the wire. EPONA'S DREAM six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily gaining through the final furlong but was ultimately
rebuffed at the finish. FROST ME bobbled slightly at the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn
advancing to stack outside the top pair three furlongs from home, knocked heads with HONEY MONEY through the latter portion of the turn and continued
three wide into upper stretch, got shaken off nearing the eighth pole, dug in loosely between foes and fought on to the finish coming again mildly at the end.
B B'S BUSTED four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six
wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. CHOOSE HAPPINESS coaxed from the gate, chased three wide until tucked inside half a
mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide for home and weakened. DANCING KIKI dueled from the three path with
HONEY MONEY to her outside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got shaken off through the latter portion of
the turn and went three wide for home, then weakened in the stretch.

SUPER JOHN displayed good speed, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path under urging on the turn, shook clear before the
five-sixteenths, responded well when put to the crop in upper stretch, drew off under a drive into the final sixteenth then was eased up while much the best.
FAMISHED charged the front of the gate just as the gate was sprung then reared, was forced out while off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled
on the outside, was urged four wide on the turn, dropped inward in upper stretch and got up for the place. ROMAN EMPIRE tracked then pressed the pace
on the outside, vied in the three path under urging on the turn, dropped back late on that bend and weakened then lost the place while clear for the show.
MANDATORY PAYOUT broke a step slow, settled near the back, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail outside the quarter-pole, moved out outside
the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. IT'S MANDATORY broke a step slow, settled near the back, was urged along in the two then three
path on the turn, came five wide into the stretch under a drive and failed to respond. ORB IN THE TOWER veered out at the start, was coaxed along in third
position, dropped back with six furlongs to run, fell well behind in the three path on the turn and faltered.

PRIMACY four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into
upper stretch, rallied up the rail inside a trio through the final furlong to take command a sixteenth out, then inched away in the late going to prevail. TIMED
OUT crossed to the two path after the start and chased just off the inside down the backstretch before tipping four wide through the turn placed to coaxing
three furlongs from home, continued four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors in the late stages. GOLDEN PLUME
coaxed from the gate, pressed the early pace of MORE MOONSHINE along the inside from the two path, took over command nearing the nine-sixteenths
and showed the way through the turn under some pressure from MY ROXY GIRL to the outside, spun just off the inside for home and yielded the front
narrowly to that rival, dug in under a drive fighting on to the finish and was along for the show honors. MY ROXY GIRL just off the pace five paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked four then three wide advancing on the front to apply pressure three furlongs from home and under coaxing, spun three
wide into upper stretch, seized narrow command straightened away, dug in under a drive under threat from a trio and relented near the sixteenth pole, then
weakened in the very late stages. FIRING CAROL hustled from the gate, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home
and weakened. BRAVO REGINA six then five wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
MADERA broke on top at the start, then prompted the pace from the outside four paths off the rail, tucked three then two wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths pole, faded through the latter portion of the bend and went four wide into upper stretch, then folded in the drive. MORE
MOONSHINE hustled from the gate, showed brief speed from the three path under pressure from a flanking pair of rivals, conceded the front nearing the
nine-sixteenths and tucked to the two path into the turn in full retreat coaxed along, tipped five to six wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
GIMMEDAMONEY was away alertly, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path while still inside of foes on the turn, shook clear under
a drive in upper stretch and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. RIA'S ANGEL was off slow and spotted the front several lengths, raced near
the back while hard ridden, went three wide around most of the turn, gained fast coming to the five-sixteenths, shifted five wide late on the bend, remained
on his inside lead while flattening out in pursuit of the winner to the sixteenth-pole, swapped to the proper lead at that point and safely secured the place.
WILD CARP DIEM pressed the pace down the backstretch, vied in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, dropped back inside
the three-sixteenths and weakened but was clear for the show. BOSSHIP chased the pace on the outside then in the four path around the turn and tired.
BOINTHEBACK was urged along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path and failed to respond. JOHNSELECTRICRIDE broke in and hit the
gate, dropped back under urging, saved ground on the turn and also failed to respond. CROSTATA B C was fractious in the gate then backed out and
reloaded, raced off the pace under urging, dropped back four wide on the turn and capitulated. WALK THE BANK was restless in the gate then broke a step
slow, raced very greenly towards the rear, rounded the turn in the two path and was no factor. WINETASTIC broke a step slow, was urged along on the
outside, went five wide on the turn, suffered an injury inside the three-eighths and was pulled up then euthanized on the track.
