Footnotes
GOLDEN ISLE broke awkwardly at the back, quickly recovered rushing up outside to chase LADY YOUNES, caught that rival and moved clear approaching
the stretch, stayed on her left lead and had just enough to hang on. CUPID AUSTIN saved ground outsprinted early, shifted out three wide nearing the
stretch, lugged in leaving the furlong grounds, surged late and just missed outside the winner. GRAN MAMIBELLA stayed in range to the stretch two wide,
got crowded and forced in by CUPID AUSTIN in deep stretch, and ran on best of the others. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH had a rail trip, and steadied inside
GRAN MAMIBELLA in deep stretch. MIAMI SOUVENIRS was outrun to the stretch, and passed only tired horses. UNCAPTURED FAITH raced three to four
wide, and lacked a response. LADY YOUNES set the pace inside, got collared by the winner late on the turn, and folded up. BLAME THE MEDIA steadied
entering the turn while a bit green, and dropped far back. AN OBECTION BY THE RIDER OF WE'VE HAD ENOUGH AGAINST GRAN MAMIBELLA FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
BOLDNESS vied for the lead out of the chute then settled off the pacesetter and tracked rival into the turn, launched a two wide bid near the five sixteenths
pole, vied for the lead with METEORITO into the stretch run, dug in gamely under firm handling and edged ahead in late stages. METEORITO vied for the
lead with the eventual winner out of the chute then cleared on top and set the pace, came under attack from rivals late on the turn, dueled for the lead with
BOLDNESS into the stretch run, fought back under firm pressure into the final furlong then had no closing kick left in reserve. TWO PRINCES angled off the
inside in early stages and settled while rated just off the early pace, was ridden along three to four wide around the turn, swung wide approaching the upper
stretch, came in a few paths under pressure, sustained a steady bid and secured show. SPIN RATE was not too far off the early pace and saved ground up
the backstretch, launched a rail bid around the turn, gained closer contention in the upper stretch then flattened out in the final sixteenth. KING SLEW (ARG)
tracked the pace up the backstretch, was ridden along two wide through the turn, stayed on two to three wide into the stretch run and failed to kick on.
CHROME FINISH stumbled at the start and quickly recovered to be forwardly placed, stalked the top two leaders up the backstretch, loomed a threat three
wide at the quarter pole, drifted out wider turning for home and steadily faded.

RECONFIGURE stalked the pace three wide, seized command in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. NEW YORK'S FINEST was in range inside,
swung four wide nearing the lane and was along late for the place. GRAN MALBEC settled off the early pace while racing two wide, angled five wide leaving
the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and was along for the show in the final strides. FOREST SURVIVOR set the pace along the rail, was
collared in upper stretch and weakened. HARD BELLE was bumped at the start, raced four wide and never threatened. NO NAY MAYBE (IRE) pressed the
pace two wide and tired in the lane. STAR WEAVER was bumped at the start, dropped far back, was eased around the turn, jogged across the wire and
walked off.

Footnotes
HOLDING COURT pressed the pace outside ICE LOVE and HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES, reached a short lead approaching the quarter-pole with pressure on
both flanks, and turned back HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES after a long drive. HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES got the best of an early dispute with ICE LOVE, dug in
when HOLDING COURT ranged alongside late on the turn, fought on gamely inside that rival but was bested to the wire. DISCO QUEEN trailed for a
half-mile, shifted out four wide to loom a threat outside the leaders with five-sixteenths remaining, but flattened out through upper stretch. ICE LOVE
contested the pace inside HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES for a half, and weakened on the turn. FERMINA DAZA was four wide off the leaders leaving the
backstretch, but retreated before reaching the midway point on the turn.

vied for the lead inside into the late backstretch, edged back just off the leader entering the far turn, tipped two wide and launched a re-bid at the head of the
lane, took over the lead with a furlong left to run then got collared by the winner shortly after. STARSHIP NTERPRISE got carried out five wide around the
first turn, was unhurried and raced in the back of the pack, hustled up midway around the far turn, got carried out six wide entering the upper stretch, came
in a couple paths under pressure and got up for show. HAVANA LOVE (IRE) raced four wide around the first turn, vied for the lead in the early backstretch,
weakened off the leader then launched a four wide rebid around the far turn, remained in range until mid-stretch then flattened out. UNDISTURBED vied for
the lead up the backstretch, shook free entering the far turn, continued to lead the way into the upper stretch, got collared by INTO VANISHING with a
furlong left to run and gave way. INGRASSIA vied three wide for the lead up the backstretch, could not match strides but remained forwardly placed two
wide around the far turn then came up tired in the drive.

STORMY PATTERN broke inwardly, set the pace in the two path, shook clear nearing the quarter pole, widened under right-handed urging in upper stretch
then held clear under confident handling in the final furlong. MACHISTO prompted the winner while racing between foes in the three path, could not
seriously gain on that foe in the lane but stayed well clear of the rest. CARNIVORE lacked early speed, saved ground throughout and ran on for the show.
POSEIDON'S SON tracked the pace four and five wide, bid near the quarter pole but faded in the lane. KING TSUNAMI stalked the pace four wide and
faltered nearing the lane. DUBROVNIK was eased around the turn, pulled up near the sixteenth pole and walked off.

Footnotes
PERFECT KIMBERLY S tracked the leaders two wide to the far turn, shifted out four wide to challenge for command at the top of the stretch, kicked clear
through the furlong grounds, then dug in to keep BELLE'S KINGDOM at bay late. BELLE'S KINGDOM saved ground in the second flight early, got shuffled
back to last along the rail midway on the far turn, moved out three wide for room nearing the stretch, bid outside PERFECT KIMBERLY S into the final
furlong but could not get by. KENTUCKY PRIDE hugged the rail just off the pace, was in a bit tight along the rail in upper stretch, and was up inside
ENGLISH CHARMER to snag the show. ENGLISH CHARMER set the pace in the two-path for six furlongs, and weakened through the lane. EAGLE EYE
broke outward and was last away, prompted the pace from outside to the stretch, and tired. CACTUS KITTEN raced four wide and made no impact.
BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY raced two three wide on the turns, and had no response when roused into the far turn.

Footnotes
BIG DADDY DAVE sped to the lead and angled inside soon after the start, continued to show the way around the turn, roused for more turning for home,
responded willingly, widened to a clear advantage on top and finished going away. AERONAUT was forwardly placed racing just off the early leader,
launched a bid for BIG DADDY DAVE mid-way through the turn, was ridden along two wide into the upper stretch, stayed on with response but could not
reach the clear winner and settled for second best. DEMOCRACY was away last and raced five paths wide through early stages, came under a ride four
wide entering the turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and secured a share. CAJUN COMMANDER raced in contention on the inside in early
stages, tipped out mid-way around the turn, came three wide into the lane, sustained bid to mid-stretch then flattened out. CREATIVE CLOUD raced three
to four wide not too far back in early stages, lost position entering the turn, saved ground into the upper stretch and had no late response.

Footnotes
FISH MOONEY settled off the early pace while racing two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, closed outside and was up in deep stretch.
MYFAVORITEDAUGHTER stalked the pace two wide, bid between foes leaving the eighth pole but was outkicked. PALMACH set the pace along the rail,
drifted out a bit in upper stretch, led to deep stretch and was vanned off after the finish. SISTER NELL raced four wide in midpack and was one-paced
through the lane. SUNSTRIKE (IRE) was up close two wide around the first turn, saved ground just behind the leaders rounding the far turn, had a clear
path inside of the pacesetter throughout the stretch but weakened through the final furlong. EASY COME EASY GO failed to menace while racing three and
four wide. VANDALIA had early speed inside, was in tight rounding the first turn, steadied and dropped back late on that bend, saved ground from there and
lacked any further bids.

Footnotes
TIMMY M. was a step slow at the start, trailed for a half-mile, advanced with a five-wide sweep on the far turn, reached the front through midstretch and
drove clear. MISTER LEONARDO saved ground unhurried early, steadied behind TIGER along the inside midway on the far turn, remained bottled up in
traffic on the rail into the stretch, altered course outside entering the final furlong and finished with good courage. ASTROTURF settled in the second flight
two wide for six furlongs, moved out to the four-path turning for home, and offered a mild response. TIGER was close up inside for a half-mile, steadied and
lost position waiting for room on the far turn, came back on through upper stretch inside, but flattened out late. EXCHANGE DAY set the early pace near the
inside, stayed on to the furlong grounds, then gave way. FEAST prompted the pace outside for six furlongs, and tired in the stretch. SUPER DESIGN
steadied between TIGER and FEAST entering the first turn, lodged a three-wide bid to reach a short lead after six furlongs, but faltered through the lane.
MAYOR REMO saved ground early, advanced with a mild run on the far turn three then four wide, but had nothing left into the lane.
