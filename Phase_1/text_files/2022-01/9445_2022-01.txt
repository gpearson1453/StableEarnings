Footnotes
WORLD OF FOOLS chased through the backstretch, came between horses with the lead entering the stretch and dug in under steady encouragement to
hold off the challenge of SLOE GIN BIZ, who pressured the pace and contested at a close disadvantage three wide on the turn, but was outfinished in a
stretch long duel. CURLIN'S MALIBU chased outside, ran in the seven and eight paths on the turn, raced widest leaving the turn and dueled through the
stretch for third. SUPER JORDAN was eased toward the outside to give chase, rounded the turn in the six and seven paths then outfinished in the stretch
duel for third. HE IS BONAFIDE set a pressured pace, was headed at the rail nearing the top of the stretch then weakened toward the sixteenth pole.
BUCKS LODGE chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail then flattened the final sixteenth. BIG PERFECTION chased outside, ran in the five path of the
turn and showed little further. MYGIDGETMARIE pressured the pace to the quarter pole then flattened in the four path of the turn. This race was hand
timed.

Footnotes
LADIES SIGNATURE chased through the backstretch, challenged from the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn off the rail, dug in from the head of the
lane to take over later yards and raced clear under the wire. DEALER'S GIRL chased, rounded the turn at the rail, eased out entering the stretch and dug in
to take second the final strides. GANDHI'S CASTLE cleared the field leaving the chute and set the pace, dug in to the challenge of Ladies Signature at the
five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn at the rail, was steadily encourged leaving the eighth pole but succumbed in later yards. ANAZARA chased, rounded
the turn in the three and four paths and ran evenly in the lane. CAT LAK chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail and finished evenly.
MAE SAI PRINCESS gave chase toward the outside, ran in the six path of the turn and passed rivals outside. BRING IT ON HOME was pinched back on
the chute, gave chase through the backstretch, left the turn at the rail but showed little more. WORLD IS MY CITY gave chase then flattened in the four path
of the turn. I AM I WILL gave chase then flattened in the five path of the turn. DIMITRI'S ROMANCE was not a factor. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
TINA'S SONG stalked off the rail, closed for the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole, drew clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled through
the lane. QUINCYS WAY rated off the pace inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then dueled for second mid-stretch.
CHARITABLE MISS rounded the opening turn about the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn two deep and ran evenly in the
lane. PROUDLY ELEGANT rated a short lead inside, was caught approaching the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, dropped back at
the rail midway on the far turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. SISTER SECRET LEE rounded the opening turn about the three path and raced outside
into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn but had little left. CHOPRA ran in the four path the first
turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the three path and showed
little more.

Footnotes
CHARGING LION stalked inside then took the nod at the seven sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, dug in while in tight between horses leaving the
far turn, was jostled past the sixteenth pole but held on determinedly. TIVANO settled off the rail, bid nearing the quarter pole, dug in while in tight quarters
at the rail leaving the far turn, exchanged contact with Charging Lion past the sixteenth pole and continued on gamely. MOTI rated close about the three
path, bid past the three eighths pole and raced close in the three path of the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane, made contact with Charging Lion
mid-stretch and was outfinished the final sixteenth. CANTAKEITANYMORE broke outward to make contact with Blue Sky Painter and settled off the pace,
bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then flattened in the lane. TIZEZZY settled off the early pace about the four
path, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn and showed little more. EXCALIBUR broke in to make contact with BLUE SKY
PAINTER then closed to the lead four wide midway on the first turn and rated the pace, was met at the seven sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, but
dropped back into the far turn and weakened, while the latter was jostled at the break and never factored. GIO DUDE was through after a half mile. The
Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Charging Lion, lodged by the rider of Tivano, though, found no cause for change.

Footnotes
PEPPA STARR pressured the pace inside and dueled at even terms from the five sixteenths pole, took the nod at the rail nearing the quarter pole, drew
clear midway on the turn and was steadily handled down the lane. COLLEGE KID chased, rounded the turn about the three path, dueled for second inside
the sixteenth pole and was gaining on the winner. LADY STORM chased, rounded the turn about the three path, eased outward through the upper stretch
and dueled for third while gaining on the top two. COACH RUBE was bumped leaving the gate then gave chase toward the inside, angled out nearing the
head of the lane, left the turn about the six path and finished well widest. MANAROLA broke in to make contact with Coach Rube then picked up the chase,
rounded the turn off the rail, lacked room leaving the turn but finished well. BACI gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and finished evenly.
JUSTALITTLEVIOLENT ducked out at the break and raced wide early. DARK TRICKS took over and tapered in to set a pressured pace, dueled at even
terms from the five sixteenths pole, ceded the nod at the quarter, dropped back midway on the turn, showed no further response and was eased the final
sixteenth. This race was hand timed.
