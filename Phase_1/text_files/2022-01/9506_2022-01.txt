BRINEE vied for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, pulled away down the lane and won under steady urging. BOURN pressed the pace,
forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. RAVENS BLING dueled on the front end, raced close throughout and
lacked a late kick. ANGIE AT THEOFFICE raced within striking distance, came around the turn on the outside and finished evenly. QUALITY BOW broke a
step slow, racing in the rear, showed late interest, but was no factor. CERTAINUNCERTAINTY raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the
final turn and put forth an even effort. SHE'S GOT CHROME raced evenly near the back, came around the turn on the outside and lacked a bid. I LOVE
YOU MORE always raced near the back, finished wide and was no threat. CHARMING KAT bobbled at the start, raced in the middle of the field and faded.
HURRICANE SIREN lacked early speed, finished wide and showed little.

HEART THAT BINDS unhurried in the beginning, made a steady gain, raced outside around the second turn, drove clear down the lane and won under
steady urging. ZYDECO MUSIC pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, made a late rail bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear
second. BYANYMEANS trailed in the early going, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a bid, proved no match for the top two, but was a
clear third. A. K. A. GRAMS vied for the early advantage, saved ground around the final turn and faded. ENDURING PEACE raced within striking distance,
came around the second turn on the inside, weakened and finished evenly. AMERICAN REBEL raced in the middle of the pack, weakened and was no
threat late. MOLLY GOLIGHTLY raced evenly near the back, came around the first turn on the outside, finished wide and was never close. BIND ON
EARTH vied for the early lead and dropped back. OLD FASHION AMOUR raced near the middle of the field and retreated. ONETWOMANYROCKETS
refused, walked off.

Footnotes
DA'MONEY ALARM went to the front, drove clear, was collared around the turn, while saving ground, drifted out down the stretch and won under urging.
CUSTOM BLUE GRASS raced within striking distance, saved ground around the turn, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear
second. BOUJIE ONE raced within contention, was close throughout and lacked a late rally. HELLO HEARTBREAKER lacked early speed, came around
the turn wide, made an outside bid and was outfinished for third. RODESSA FLASH raced near the back, made a mild bid, but was no factor.
PRODUCTION TIME void of early speed, came around the turn wide, improved position, but was no threat. KANNON WITH A K broke out, bumped, raced
within contention and faded. JACKIE MOON dueled on the front end and dropped back. LOUISIANA LEE always raced near the back and showed little.
PREOCCUPIED was fractious in the gates, bumped at the start, raced in the middle of the field and retreated to the rear.
