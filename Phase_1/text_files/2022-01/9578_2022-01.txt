Footnotes
CAGUA raced two wide around the first turn, settled nicely while rated two to three wide up the backstretch, made a move mid-way around the far turn,
angled out and swept by three wide at the head of the lane, cleared command and finished going away. SPLICER sat in good position tracking the pace up
the backstretch, launched a three wide bid around the far turn, sustained bid into the stretch run and got up late to take place. BRAIN TRUST was forwardly
placed three wide around the first turn, stalked the pacesetter through early stages, advanced to engage rival for the lead late on the far turn, edged ahead
turning for home, got collared shortly after by the eventual winner and lost place in final strides. PLAYA INCLUSION secured inside position around the first
turn, tracked near midpack up the backstretch, hustled up along the rail around the far turn, tipped two wide for the drive and failed to move on. ENOUGH
RAIN saved ground around the first turn, angled out and settled three wide through early stages, shifted out five wide in the upper stretch and lacked a
needed rally. STORMY STELLA sped to the lead at the start, set the pace inside up the backstretch, got collared by BRAIN TRUST leaving the far turn and
steadily faded. LLUVIA was headstrong and steadied heading into the first turn, tugged before settling mid-backstretch, saved ground then shifted out five
wide for the drive and had no response. LUNA CIAO raced three wide in the back throughout and never menaced.

Footnotes
PRETTY RACHEL set the pace in the two path and widened under a drive. TIME TO TWO STEP chased the winner three wide and was clearly second
best. CHEZ PAREE was in tight at the start, saved ground off the pace and was along for the show. DANCE TILL DAWN pressed the winner down the
backstretch, checked while appearing to try to get out leaving the three-eighths pole and had no further bids. INFATUATING tracked the pace two wide and
tired after a half. DON'T MAKE ME BEG played no factor while racing four wide.

STACIAS RUBY took control after an alert beginning, shook off ULTIMATE BREEZE around the turn, and widened the advantage through the stretch while
drifting out. ARTIFICIAL INTELL raced two wide in the second flight for a half-mile, moved inside finding her best stride in midstretch, and went clear of the
rest while never a threat to the winner. O PRINCESS bumped with GOSSIPING at the start, chased outside to the stretch, and had no closing bid.
GOSSIPING bumped with O PRINCESS at the start, and was no factor inside. ULTIMATE BREEZE pursued STACIAS RUBY from outside to the stretch,
and tired in the final furlong. CROOKLYN stumbled at the start, and trailed outside.

Footnotes
CHACALOSA was not tooo far back in early stages, picked up the pace between foes mid-way around the turn, roused forward three wide to challenge the
top pair approaching the upper stretch, vied for the lead into the final furlong then kicked clear. MOUNT SINAI was forwardly placed inside soon after the
start, was patiently handled along the rail on the turn, shifted out four wide at the head of the lane, closed with response and gained place. ALA TURKA was
away last and raced outside in the last flight, was set down five wide at the head of the lane, steadily edged up closer and gained show. RUNAWAY
BREEZE was forwardly placed racing just off the leader in early stages, moved up two wide to engage PRINCESS CUPID for the lead late on the turn, vied
between foes into the final furlong then gave way. PRINCESS CUPID sped to the lead soon after the start, continued to show the way into the turn, took on
the challenge from a duo at the head of the lane, dueled into the final furlong then came up empty. SUSANS NOVELA raced in the back saving ground,
shifted out five wide in the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. BLAME IT ON ROSE was reluctant to load, raced outside in range through early stages
then came up empty late on the turn.

Footnotes
BRAVO ZULU set a rated pace along the rail, shook clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive. OMIXOCHITL stalked the pace three wide, bid
nearing the quarter pole, was no match for the winner in the lane and lasted between foes for the place. JAIMIE'S WARRIOR bobbled at the break, steadied
entering the first turn, raced two wide in midpack, angled four wide near the quarter pole and ran on to gain the show. LINN PIER stalked the pace from the
rail and was one-paced through the lane. SPOOKY SPICE prompted the winner two wide for six furlongs and faded through the stretch.
COUNTESSOFLOVELACE was shuffled back not long after the start, saved ground and played no factor. ZAMBAK failed to menace while racing two wide.
MAGNOLIA ROAD was off slow, raced two and three wide and never threatened. FREEZE THE DAY was outrun while racing three and four wide. ALL IN
JEST chased the pace four wide and was through after a half. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH FRACTIONS AND RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
KINGSTON QUEEN broke to the lead, showed the way inside two pursuers, and dug in through the stretch to keep K COTTEE at bay. K COTTEE pressed
KINGSTON QUEEN from the outset, had aim through a long drive but could not get by. SHEZ RECKLESS chased outside the leaders, drifted to the
five-path turning for home, and ran on evenly to remain clear of the remainder. DOLCE APRILE broke a step slow and was outsprinted to the stretch, and
improved position outside without threatening. I B NASTY was no factor inside. BRODY'S CAUSEWAY brushed the right side of the gate and was slowest
away, and never got close. AWESOME APEAL raced three to four wide, and faded steadily after three-eighths of a mile. BLUSHING KEYLEN was finished
early two wide.

Footnotes
LEVIOSA sped to the lead at the start and angled inside, showed the way into the turn, continued on top still unleashed at the quarter pole, given cue
turning for home, hustled along two to three wide into the upper stretch, edged ahead from PEACHY WEACHY under a drive and finished clear. PEACHY
WEACHY hustled up out of the gate and raced up close just off the early leader, launched a bid for LEVIOSA approaching the quarter pole, was ridden
along three wide into the upper stretch, stayed on with response under a left handed drive and secured second best. CAJUN COUSIN raced in contention
along the inside, remained in close range along the rail around the turn, briefly came out a path then angled back to the inside and ran on to finish well clear
over the rest. DIGNIFIED was not too far back and chased two wide past the half mile marker, failed to respond under a drive around the turn, came three
wide into the lane and steadily faded. CANDYMEISTER was not too far back on the outside in the early going, failed to respond under pressure around the
turn, came four to five wide into the upper stretch and retreated.

Footnotes
MISS DELICIOUS tracked the pace two wide, tipped four wide near the quarter pole, kicked in outside, seized command near the sixteenth pole and drew
off readily. SYSTEMATIC stalked the pace four wide, took the lead near the quarter pole, led to the sixteenth pole and was no match for the winner from
there. ALPHA BABE had her head turned at the start, saved ground while trailing early, advanced four wide around the far turn, was brushed in upper
stretch and rallied for the show. MIA AT MIDNIGHT saved ground off the pace, swung four wide in upper stretch, brushed ALPHA BABE leaving the
three-sixteenths pole, battled inside of that foe for the show and was outfinished. MONGOLIAN MISSION pressed the pace in the three path, led between
foes midway around the far turn and weakened through the stretch. ROSA STAR was washy pre-race, set the pace in the two path and tired in the lane.
RASPBERRY BALLET was outrun inside. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH FRACTIONS AND RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
PAPA HONOR saved ground in striking range to the far turn, waited for room behind the leaders with a quarter-mile remaining, got through in the two-path
between horses into the stretch, battled inside VELOCE and ON THE COUCH through a long drive, and finished on even terms with the latter. ON THE
COUCH was never far back, got floated to the four-path by VELOCE turning for home, challenged outside that rival and PAPA HONOR through the last
eighth of a mile, and took a share of the win. RACE CRAFT settled in the second flight three to four wide, and finished willingly outside the top two to get up
for the show. VELOCE prompted FINDING MISCHIEF from outside early, bid for command a quarter-mile out, drifted to the three-path vying up front into
the stretch, fought in close quarters between PAPA HONOR and ON THE COUCH into the final furlong, weakened slightly with 50 yards remaining and
steadied unable to hold his position. EASY STRIDE broke a step slow, raced four to five wide throughout, and gained only mildly late. NOT SO EASY went
along two wide to midway on the far turn, shifted out a couple more paths into the stretch and gained some ground on the far outside while not a factor.
GENERAL was forwardly placed to the far turn, and lacked the needed response. OCEAN RIDE had an inside trip, and could not reach contention.
FINDING MISCHIEF bumped with CHURCHILLS VICTORY at the start, moved in from the three-path up the backstretch, and made no impact. RESIDENT
LIBERAL raced wide and was never prominent. CHURCHILLS VICTORY bumped with FINDING MISCHIEF at the start, cleared for the lead and moved
inside leaving the first turn, and gave way soon after completing six furlongs. PROSPECT PROJECT was through early. THERE WAS A STEWARDS
INQUIRY FOCUSING ON THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.
