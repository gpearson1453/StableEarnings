A FAREWELL YODEL saved ground off the pace, closed toward contention three wide nearing the seven sixteenths pole and took the nod at the five
sixteenths, contested the edge two deep on the far turn, drew clear approaching the head of the lane and was steadily handled to hold on. JACKSON MAN
settled off the rail on the opening turn then closed to the lead two deep while between horses past the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the nod at the five
sixteenths, continued close at the rail on the far turn, dropped back toward the head of the lane, though, came back in late stretch to close the gap. QUID
PRO QUO was detained in the gate and broke in the air then saved ground, steadily improved from the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far
turn and was along for third later yards. SALTY J J rated the pace inside, was caught leaving the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, but
dropped back past the three eighths pole and faded on the far turn. MY BOY STRYKER bobbled at the break then saved ground, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, though, faded past the five sixteenths. ROCKET BALLAD dropped well back early on.

Footnotes
SHERIFF'S KID settled off the earlier pace in the two and three paths, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and dug in
the final furlong to take the nod in the last jump. COURAGEOUS GRACE broke a step slow then saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole and
dueled at even terms from the five sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn, dug in gamely to the wire but was nipped in the final jump while best for place.
LADY KAZA stalked inside and dueled at even terms nearing the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge off the rail on the far turn and dug in gamely to
deep stretch before relenting. CHINA CAT settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, started an outside bid leaving the three eighths pole, ran in
the five path of the far turn and finished evenly. JUST A BIT SASSY raced well off the pace in the three path the first turn, left the turn outside and bid
toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the six path and ran evenly in the lane. ZIG saved ground, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn in the three and four paths and showed little further. CHIT CHAT GIRL became fractious in the gate, saved ground on the opening turn
and showed little response through the backstretch. EARNED THE SHOT rounded the first turn in the three path, eased outward into the backstretch, bid
toward the seven sixteenths pole and showed little response. BEND THE KNEE took the lead shortly after the break and tapered in to rate the pace, came
under pressure at the three eighths pole, was met toward the five sixteenths and faded on the far turn. HARDSCRATCH raced close to the early pace, gave
chase from the three eighths pole, though faded on the far turn and was eased in the lane.

hustled clear and angled to the inside to set the pace, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the turn but was caught in the final strides. MISS

lane. HEROIC DEED saved early ground then eased outward into the backstretch, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path
and dueled for second mid-stretch. POSTINO'S STORY saved ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the four path of the far turn,
angled to the seven path toward the head of the lane and finished evenly to take third the final yards. NEW SOUTH stalked the early pace two deep, bid
leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then flattened the final sixteenth. FASHIONABLE rounded the first turn in the four path
and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid approaching the three eighths pole but flattened off the rail on the far turn. NOW I'M BROKE came through
the first turn in the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole then flattened in the four path of the far turn. SWEET
