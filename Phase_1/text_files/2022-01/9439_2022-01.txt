Footnotes
CREATIVE FEATURE was away in good order to duel for the lead with KEARNEY while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by AG MINISTER
approaching the stretch, vied with that rival and edged clear through the closing yards. DAREABIGDREAM was never far back, raced three-wide through
the turn, angled in with a furlong to run, could not gain on the winner late but finished well to gain the place. AG MINISTER was reserved just off the leaders
early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied with the winner and gave way in the drive. KEARNEY rushed to vie soon after the start,
steadied nearing the half and gave way. SARGE'S SERMON showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. BLAME THE
DEVIL showed brief speed, raced six-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
CLUB MESQUITE was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, slipped through to take command with a sixteenth to run and drew clear. CLASSIC
LUCK was never far back, raced five-wide through the second turn, responded when set down for the drive and rallied late. BARELYSTILLCOUNTS was
void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and finished with good energy. GREENBRIER sprinted clear at once, responded when
challenged nearing the quarter and gave way through the final furlong. FAST GALLITO was away in good order to press the pace of GREENBRIER while
racing three-wide, moved up to engage that foe nearing the quarter and gave way through the final furlong. ATLATL settled off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. RANCHER was off slow, lagged early, moved four-wide through the second turn and did not reach
contention.

run and failed to gain late. BALAS settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly. LIP'S OF WINE lacked early foot,
raced six-wide through the turn and failed to threaten. PARTY POLICE was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
KOWBOYS SISTER dropped far back early, moved four-wide through the turn and did not threaten. MAGIC START chased the leaders from the inside and
weakened after going a half. JADED SECRETS chased the leaders from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
OUT ON SATURDAY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a quarter to run and drew
off. ROWDYROOSTER settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished with a
steady bid. OUTLAW BY NATURE pressed the pace from between foes, checked nearing the half, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished
willingly. FATS DOMINUS was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. FORT YORK lacked
early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. REGAL CANDY was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn
and was not a factor. INDY'S OUTLAW chased the leaders from the inside and weakened after going a half. SUPER ACCORD was off slow, raced
three-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. NORTHERN QUEST reared at the start and unseated his rider.

Footnotes
KENNEBEC settled just off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out nearing the quarter and wore down MY INDY in the final
strides. MY INDY sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, responded when challenged by BECKHAM JAMES nearing the five-eighths
marker, re-cleared with a quarter to run but could not resist the winner from over the top. HEIR (FR) was reserved just off the leaders from the inside
throughout and failed to gain late. BECKHAM JAMES tracked the pace of MY INDY from the inside, moved up to engage that rival nearing the five-eighths
marker, vied and gave way after going six furlongs. STEAL HOME showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and failed to menace.
SEEKING REFUGE lugged at the start, lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn and did not offer a bid. HOLLYWOOD HEAT was off slow,
raced four-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders, moved three-wide through the second turn and weakened.
