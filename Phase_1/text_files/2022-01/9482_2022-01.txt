UPTOWN RHAPSODY settled off of the early pace while saving ground, improved position along the second turn while three wide, continued that run into
the stretch, closed fast on BALL LASS inside of the furlong grounds and drew clear in the end. GINGERDOODLE was unhurried through the initial half-mile,
gained ground while outside of foes on the second turn, was unable to reel in the winner in the final stages but closed well late to earn the place. BALL
LASS disputed the pace along the first turn then set solo fractions into the second turn, had a clear lead leaving the second bend but was tiring in the final
furlong and was quickly overtaken by the winner but kept on to secure third. DEELITEFUL LIZZY stalked the pace outside of foes, gained ground on the
second turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch run. HAYDEN'S ANGEL stalked the pace outside of rivals, improved position on the second turn while
three wide and weakened in the drive. LADY OF FAITH contested the early pace then ceded the lead to BALL LASS leaving the first turn, stalked the pace
to the quarter-marker and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
NAVY QUEEN was away alertly and was sent to set the fractions, rated nicely through the backstretch run, extended the lead leaving the second turn,
pulled away in the late going and was geared down in the final strides. FABRIANA was unhurried through the early stages while trailing, was steered outside
of rivals on the second turn, gained ground into the stretch and continued that run in the final sixteenth to claim the place. MISTY CAT was pinched at the
start, settled just off of the pace while outside of rivals, lost ground into the stretch run and did not have a late bid. LORETTA was three wide on the first turn,
slipped to the rail for the run into the second turn while stalking the pace, lost ground leaving the turn and gave way in the late going. DEL MAR FLASH was
fractious in the gate, pressed the pace through the first turn then took back to stalk the pace into the far turn, was three wide on the second turn and
weakened in the stretch.

DRESS REHEARSAL stalked the pace from a three wide path on the turn, was firmly urged while closing in the final furlong and had a late push to get by
the runner-up in the final stages. MISS UNION was sent after breaking well and disputed the early pace, took back along the turn to stalk the pace, vied for
the lead in the drive, led in the final sixteenth but was outfinished by the winner while holding for second. SKY MAKER stalked the pace from a four wide
path and closed willingly in the lane but could not reel in the top pair. TIZ A TIGER chased the pace outside of rivals, mounted a five wide rally into the
stretch and closed well late but was outkicked in the end. O'NEILL'S LEGACY was hustled leaving the break and dueled on the front end into the turn,
shook clear of MISS UNION along the turn, was coaxed along while on the lead into the stretch and led to the sixteenth-marker but was caught and
overtaken in the late going. THISONESFORBARRY trailed in the early stages though was never far back, was two wide on the turn and did not rally in the

Footnotes
RICH WARRIOR sat off of the quick pace while outside of rivals through the backstretch run, slipped to the two path to improve position while between foes
on the second turn, overtook the leading pair inside of the furlong marker and was urged clear in the final stages. LOVE OF THE SPORT was off a bit slow
leaving the break, saved ground while stalking the pace through the second turn, vied for the lead in the final furlong, was overtaken by the winner leaving
the furlong grounds, dueled with ALARMING MOMENT for second and dug in to secure the place. ALARMING MOMENT contested the quick pace with
MIZZEN POWER through the second turn while saving ground, shook free of that foe leaving the quarter-marker, was collared by the winner inside of the
final furlong, dueled for second in the late going and just missed for place honors. TRUTH TO POWER was allowed to settle through the early stages, was
steered five wide on the second turn and did not mount a late rally. MIZZEN POWER disputed the fast fractions to the second turn with ALARMING
MOMENT, came under pressure nearing the quarter-marker and tired in the drive. DREAMED IT tracked the pace outside of rivals to the half-mile marker,
was three wide between foes on the second turn and faded in the stretch run.

BENCH JUDGE tracked the pace outside of rivals along the first turn, pressured the pace on the second turn while two wide, closed on the pacesetter
leaving the second bend, took a narrow lead leaving the furlong marker and pulled away in the end. HOLY GHOST was unhurried through the backstretch
run while saving ground, gained ground while still on the inside in upper stretch and closed in the late going to win the nod for second. ARCH PRINCE
stalked the pace from the second flight, mounted a three wide rally on the second turn, gained ground into the stretch, was bumped out a path in mid-stretch
and kept on to challenge for second while holding safely for the show. RIVER ROSE pressed the pace pace from an inside position to the second turn, was
confronted by the winner nearing the furlong marker, could not hold off BENCH JUDGE and weakened in the drive. IMPERIAL CREED saved ground
throughout while settling just off of the pace, gained ground leaving the second turn, drifted out under firm left-handed urging in mid-stretch, came out a path
into GOING AWAY PARTY and flattened out in the late going. GOING AWAY PARTY saved ground while settling just off of the early pace, improved
position while two wide on the second turn, was pinched in mid-stretch when IMPERIAL CREED drifted nearing the sixteenth-marker and gave way in the
late stages. MUGARITZ was away in good order and set a pressured pace to the half-mile, lost action at that spot, was pulled up into the far turn and was
vanned off.
