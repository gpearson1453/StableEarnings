GLORY CALL gained command of the early pace and set the fractions while in hand into the turn, was clear into the stretch, felt pressure in the final
sixteenth from ECOLOGIST, was urged using left-handed encouragement and dug in to prevail. ECOLOGIST stalked the pace outside of rivals, made a four
wide bid into the stretch, was set down for the drive leaving the furlong marker, pressured the winner in the final sixteenth but could not reel him in in the end
while clear of the rest. COOLCROSS pressed the pace through the turn, gave ground entering the stretch and was outfinished in the drive. MAHI MAHI
stalked the pace inside of rivals into the turn, saved ground into the stretch and lacked a late kick. TWIRLING DERBY saved ground while chasing the pace,
checked in tight quarters along the turn, improved position along the rail in upper stretch, came into tight quarters in the final sixteenth and did not offer a
late rally. ARNO'S MANE MAN chased the pace outside of rivals on the turn and finished evenly in the stretch run.

and had a clear lead into the final furlong, came under pressure in the final sixteenth and held on under left-handed urging. GETTIN SIDEWAYS was
allowed to settle through the early going, gained ground outside of foes on the second turn, swung five wide for the drive, closed fast through the final
furlong and challenged the winner in the late stages but could not reel her in while besting the rest. IDA CLAIRE stumbled at the start and recovered well to
stalked the pace from an inside position, gained ground nearing the top of of the lane and was outfinished in deep stretch. REV REE stalked the pace
outside of rivals through the backstretch run, gave a bit of ground while three wide on the second turn and did not offer a late bid in the stretch run. TIZ AN
EDVENTURE was hustled from the inside leaving the break and set pressured fractions through the backstretch run, was confronted nearing the
quarter-marker, ceded the lead to MISS SUPER SAINT and weakened in the stretch drive. BLUE DIVA stumbled strongly at the start and was away slowly,
settled through the backstretch run while saving ground and did not offer a late rally.

Footnotes
DEL MO stumbled a bit at the start and was away slowly, was three wide outside of foes while settling at the rear of the field, was three wide on the second
turn, split horses nearing the quarter-marker to vied for the lead while five wide off of the turn, closed fast to overtake the runner-up in the final sixteenth and
kicked clear in the end. MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH tracked the pace along the first turn, was under a tight hold along the backstretch then was given rein to
press the pace into the second turn, took to the front into the stretch run, was overtaken by the winner nearing the sixteenth marker and was outfinished,
while clear of the rest. M K HEART steadied in tight quarters along the first turn while stalking the pace, made a middle move to track the leaders into the
second turn, lost ground into the stretch run and yielded in the final stages. ARTEMUS GORDON was sent to set the pace leaving the break, was met by
MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH along the backstretch and those two dueled into the second turn while carving out the fractions, ceded the lead nearing the
quarter-marker and weakened in the drive. CAT GAMER saved ground while stalking the pace from the midflight, lost ground on the second turn and gave
way in the stretch run. TIZ A THRILL was forwardly placed in the early going while stalking the pace outside of rivals, gained ground on the second turn
while three wide but did not go on with that run and tired in the drive. FLOYD KNOWLES was allowed to settle in the early going, was four wide on the
second turn, steadied nearing the quarter-marker while being passed by the winner and faded in the stretch run.

R M C HOOK'EM was hustled leaving the break and cleared the field to set the quick pace into the turn, extended the lead into the stretch and won in a
drive. LONG LANCE chased the pace from the second flight while three wide between foes, angled out for the drive and closed well in the late stages to get
up for second. BANG FOR YOUR BUCK stalked the pace into the turn from a two wide path, lost a bit of ground to the winner leaving the turn, was firmly
urged in the stretch and was outfinished in the final sixteenth, just missing for second. TORPEDO AWAY chased the pace from the inside and was
outkicked in the stretch run. PAINT ME LUCKY chased the pace into the turn while two wide between rivals, was two wide on the turn, was blocked and
lacked room in upper stretch and had no late rally. MEET THE SHERIFF stalked the pace outside of rivals into the turn and did not have a late response.

Footnotes
ANITANEWMERCEDES was forwardly placed while saving ground through the backstretch run, took over the lead on the second turn when HYPERSONIC
stopped nearing the quarter-marker, was under a firm hand ride in upper stretch, dug in when pressured by MY SUNSHINE and held on to prevail. MY
SUNSHINE stalked the pace while saving ground into the backstretch run, improved position along the second turn, tipped out for the drive, closed ground
on the winner under left-handed encouragement and just missed for the win in the end, while clear of the rest. GOING AWAY PARTY settled just off of the
pace outside of foes through the first half-mile, gained ground while two wide on the second turn, was coaxed along into the stretch and finished willingly to
claim the show in the final strides. UPO was four wide on the first turn, was unhurried while outside of rivals into the second turn, found his best stride late in
the final sixteenth and was gaining in the end, just missing for the show. CANNONBALL COMIN tracked the pace into the backstretch run, gained ground on
the pacesetter nearing the second turn, was within aim nearing the quarter-marker and was outkicked in the drive. HYPERSONIC was sent leaving the
break to clear the field into the first turn, set the fractions into the second turn, dropped back quickly along the second turn and was empty in the stretch run.
OH BE ONE was unhurried in the early going while saving ground inside of foes, went three wide along the second turn to avoid a quickly retreating foe and
lacked a late rally in the stretch run.

Footnotes
HEY MATE was off alertly and showed good early speed while setting quick fractions, steadily extended the lead along the turn and pulled away in the end.
TRUTH SEEKER was away a bit slowly and was unhurried in the early stages, was three wide on the turn, swung to eight wide for the stretch run and
mounted a bold late rally and while unable to catch the winner was up in time for the place. A MAN'S MAN bumped with JAZZ HANDS at the break and then
was rank and hard to place in the first quarter, chased the pace from the second flight while three wide on the turn, swung to the seven path for the drive
and rallied through the lane, just missing for second. JAZZ HANDS traded bumps with A MAN'S MAN leaving the break and chased the pace into the turn
between foes, continued to be in tight along the turn and gave way in the late going. MISTER BOLD saved ground while stalking the pace into the turn and
weakened in the stretch run. FLICFLAC had no speed in the early going, improved position on the turn while two wide and flattened out in the stretch run.
UNCLE FRED chased the pace outside of rivals under a hold, was four wide on the turn, swung to six wide for the drive, took up in mid-stretch while being
passed and yielded in the late going. COPPER HALO pressed HEY MATE in the early stages and into the turn while two wide, lost ground on the winner
nearing the furlong marker and tired in the stretch run. SQUARE DEAL was forwardly placed in the early going and into the turn, was three wide between
foes on the turn, lost ground into the stretch and gave way in the drive.
