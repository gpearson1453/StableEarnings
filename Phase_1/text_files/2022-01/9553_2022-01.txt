Footnotes
SUSIKIN, bumped soundly just after the start, was righted quickly to press the pace between foes racing through the backstretch, edged forward to a narrow
advantage nearing upper stretch, then gamely held her challengers to the end under firm encouragement. TALE OF V K tracked just off the first flight racing
four wide into the turn, continued in that path finding her best stride and closed the gap while edging a rival for the place honors. SALSA RITA swerved out
in the opening stages bumping the eventual winner, prompted the pace inside the foe into the turn, moved to challenge for command nearest the rail
midstretch but flattened out nearing the wire. PEACEFUL WAY, in touch with the leaders three wide attending the pace on the backstretch, couldn't match
terms with the winner after a half and gave way racing into the stretch. OFFLEE IRISH settled last, angled to the inside on the turn but offered no rally.

Footnotes
JULIE'S GRACE broke readily to gain a position stalking just off the leaders three deep on the backstretch, pressed the issue to strike the front nearing
upper stretch, shifted out while being roused to repel a rival's bid racing past midstretch and just held that foe under firm handling. WATER WIZARD was
rated between foes just off the first flight racing to the turn, steadily gained terms with the eventual winner four deep nearing upper stretch, struck the front
midstretch, then was carried out in the closing stages while just failing to match the winner's kick. J D'S VISTA was rated off the second flight outside foes
on the backstretch, swung out six wide nearing the lane while being prompted to advance and continued well enough to prevail for a share. WINNING
MANDATE tracked the leaders five wide in second flight, was prompted to lodge a brief bid in that path nearing the lane but had no late kick. MYRA
FLEENER settled between foes on the backstretch, then continued with an even effort to improve position three wide between foes racing into the lane.
ADRIANA ES BONITA angled inwards tracking the leaders between foes in second flight, shifted out three wide to gain position racing through the turn but
flattened out racing past midstretch. MISCHIEF REIGNS, off slowly, settled last, swung five wide racing into the lane and passed some tiring rivals. KATY
AND EMMA settled between foes and offered no rally. ANOTHER SAUCY SIX tracked off the first flight inside foes racing to the turn and steadily faded on
the bend. BELLABOO, urged between foes pressing the pace into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. THAWED was urged inside foes pressing the pace
but emptied out abruptly after a half.

Footnotes
SHE DAZZLE tracked just off the pacesetter between foes through the backstretch, switched outside that foe to advance in the three path racing into upper
stretch and produced a solid late response to wear down LADY JEAN in time under firm handling. The latter moved clear in the opening stages dictating the
pace on a narrow margin between foes on the backstretch, widened that margin on the turn, held sway racing off the rail past midstretch but couldn't fend off
the winner's late bid. BION MAGIC tracked the leader three wide between foes in the opening stages, was eased back conceding position racing into the
turn, then angled to the inside to regain some position while gaining a share in the closing stages. DR. ANN tracked the pacesetter four deep in second flight
on the backstretch, continued three wide through the bend and faded in the drive. CEFALO settled off the second flight in early stages, raced four wide into
the turn while being prompted to advance but had no closing bid. MASTERING BELA settled along the inside early and failed to menace. PRINCESS
JAVONCIA tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside racing into the turn and faded on early.

Footnotes
KATIES A LADY was prompted to terms with the leaders three deep racing through the chute, stalked just off the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the
backstretch, steadily drew on terms with the pacesetter bidding for command between foes racing past the quarter mile marker, then wrested the advantage
and went clear under firm handling. TEA'S DREAM was rated along the inside tracking just off the first flight in the opening half, shifted out to bid three deep
for command nearing upper stretch, couldn't match terms with the winner but continued with interest to narrowly prevail for the place honors. ANAHIYA'S
DREAM, in touch with the leaders between foes attending the pace in early stages, stalked just off the pacesetter to the second bend, continued under
patient handling nearing upper stretch, switched out racing into the lane to bid between rivals but couldn't close the gap on the winner while just missing for
second. REDZILLA, urged to the lead inside foes racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the far turn and gave way racing past
midstretch. TIZ NENA, exchanged bumps while caught in tight quarters just after the start, was reserved to the backstretch, shifted to the rail nearing the far
turn while commencing her advance, saved ground to upper stretch, then lost momentum when racing inside a tiring foe midstretch, was taken in hand in
the closing stages and switched off the inside nearing the wire. BELLE GOSSE settled along the inside dropping well off the leaders, swung outside foes
nearing upper stretch, then altered course five wide in the stretch while continuing with an effort to gain some position. STARSHIP PRECIOUS tracked the
leaders outside foes in second flight, shifted three wide nearing the lane and came up empty. DURA THE EXPLORER tracked off the second flight along the
inside, switched out racing into the far turn but had no rally. TIPHARAH exchanged bumps early, raced wide to the lane and proved no threat. PRINCESS
ZURI dropped out early.

wide pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, moved to close the gap nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. MIAMI CHROME settled outside foes
in early stages, was fanned five wide into the lane and continued to improve position. FIFTY CENTS urged inside foes dictating the pace on a narrow
advantage racing into the turn, drifted out racing into upper stretch and gave way. TITHED was settled while guided inside early, switched out to race four
wide between foes into the lane and made no impact. BUSHIDO'S WAY, urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
SWEET DUTCHESS, reserved in early stages, shifted out four wide racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance, produced a steady rally racing
into the lane to bid inside STANDUP COMEDIENNE in late stages and went clear under firm handling. The latter was urged clear outside rivals racing into
the first turn, held sway on a commanding margin past midstretch, then drifted out in the closing stages while just failing to contain the winner. DREAM
NORTH was rated out of striking distance tracking the pacesetter outside a rival in second flight, shifted three wide racing into the lane and made some mild
progress to close the gap between foes. NOVEL IDEA, reserved in the last flight early, tipped outside foes on the backstretch while being prompted to
advance, swung five wide racing into upper stretch and made some belated progress. PRINCESS VOODOO tracked off the second flight along the inside to
the far turn and continued evenly. COFFEE BEAN, held up just off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, lacked the needed late
response. SAFE TRAVELS tracked off the second flight outside foes in early stages, made brief progress three deep racing into the far turn but came up
empty in the drive. CONSISTENTLY settled along the inside early and failed to menace. SABELLE, reserved while angling to the inside racing to the
backstretch, offered no rally. ALLEZ LELE, urged to a forward placing along the inside tracking the pacesetter in second flight, steadily retreated racing into
the far turn.

Footnotes
ALLEN tracked just off the pacesetter three wide to the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path racing into upper stretch and produced a solid
closing response in the final stages to prevail under firm handling. DREAM KEEPER broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow margin just off the rail
racing to the far turn, resisted the winner's challenge past midstretch but was collared late. VICARAGE was rated off the second flight along the inside to the
backstretch, dropped out last under patient handling racing into the far turn, gathered momentum while swinging out four wide in upper stretch and finished
with interest to close the gap on the top pair. STYNER raced just off the pacesetter, then steadied between foes in close quarters midway through the first
turn, continued pulling a bit to the second bend, was urged to advance between foes, then shifted inwards in the lane and had no final bid. CORRADO, off
slowly, settled well off the leaders to the backstretch, was prompted to advance swinging out five wide in the lane but had no closing bid. GUINESSEY
tracked just off the pacesetter inside rivals in the opening half, saved ground on the far turn and faded in the drive. IRISH VALOR settled outside a rival
racing to the backstretch, swung outside foes on the far turn but offered no rally.

AND WON was guided to the inside leaving the chute tracking the leaders inside a rival as part of the second flight, was prompted to advance along the rail
racing into the far turn, was urged to challenge for command inside the pacesetter midstretch, then drifted out in the closing stages but just edged
DAZZLING TRUTHS under firm encouragement. The latter was rated just out of striking distance tracking the leaders outside a rival to the backstretch,
steadily gained terms with the leaders three deep nearing the lane, was fanned four wide midstretch bidding for command and just missed. ISAIAS DREAM
was rated off the second flight while angling inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, shifted out racing past midstretch and was
going well four wide between foes to close the gap on the top pair. SANDY LANE KITTEN, forwardly placed tracking just off the leader in early stages,
conceded some position on the backstretch, advanced to press the leader on the far turn into the lane but weakened nearing the wire. FLY FLY AWAY
broke readily, dictated the pace along the inside while going clear after a half, set the pace into the second bend, dueled inside a rival into the lane, shifted
out while being urged to resist challengers but yielded in the final sixteenth. BIRD'S EYE VIEW tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch,
was fanned five wide racing into the lane and had no closing bid. MOTATAABEQ tracked off the second flight between foes to the far turn, shifted out racing
into upper stretch but had no rally. FAST FIRE settled along the inside racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. THOMOND PARK, reserved along the
inside in the opening half, never seriously menaced. ATREYU trailed throughout. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY

Footnotes
MIL DOSCIENTOS tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight on the backstretch, steadily gained on the leaders four wide nearing upper stretch,
came in to challenge the leader in upper stretch, wrested the advantage and went clear late under firm handling. REGAL HOLIDAY tracked just off the first
flight between foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside nearing the turn while being urged to bid inside the leaders, pressed the issue on the turn to
gain the advantage nearing upper stretch but proved no match for the winner in the drive. ROCKY DICE tracked off the second flight outside foes into the
turn and continued four wide through the closing stages while gaining a share in the drive. PELLEGRINI settled off the second near the inside early, tipped
out nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance and gained position between foes. OXBOW KID, urged along the inside pursuing the leaders
into the turn, was steadied while shifting a bit off the rail racing into upper stretch and had no further response. DANCING SOLDAT settled last, angled to
the inside racing into the bend, switched out racing into the lane and passed tiring foes. DADASHEV settled near the inside as part of the last, drifted out
nearing upper stretch crossing into the path of BUSTER BURNS and TAPINTOYOURBEER and had no rally. CHARLIE'S NO SAINT, urged to dispute the
pace inside a rival in the opening stages, dueled between foes racing into the turn and gave way nearing the lane. TAPINTOYOURBEER broke in the air,
settled outside foes racing to the turn, was carried wide into upper stretch and proved no factor. BUSTER BURNS settled between foes in the last flight,
then was forced out nearing upper stretch. EXQUISITE DUDE broke sharply, pressed the pace outside foes racing three deep into the bend and gave way
abruptly after a half. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF OXBOW KID LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF PELLEGRINI
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
SALIMAH (IRE), off a bit slowly, settled into stride racing to the first turn, switched outside foes midway through the backstretch gathering momentum,
circled foes five wide racing into upper stretch, shifted inwards under pressure but quickly drew off to prove clearly best. DAWN was rated off the second
flight outside a rival racing to the far turn, then came through close quarters splitting foes three deep in the final stages to narrowly prevail for the place
honors. CROSS FLEET sped to the lead while angling over, dictated the pace along the inside to the second bend, resisted several challengers to maintain
the advantage to midstretch but gave out once headed by the winner. CHANGE PLANS worked her way to the inside early tracking behind the second flight,
came around a rival racing through the far turn, then was prompted to advance along the rail in the lane but was outkicked for a share. CUPIDS DREAM
tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight, advanced to lodge a brief bid between foes entering the far turn, drifted out racing into upper stretch
and weakened in the drive. SOCIAL ANIMAL settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, then split foes three wide in the closing staged to
gain some position while making no impact. SHESASCOLDASICE settled last, saved ground to the lane and passed only tiring rivals. DONNA LIRICA
tracked the pacesetter three deep in the second flight to the backstretch, was urged to lodge a brief bid entering the far turn but soon emptied out. XCARET
tracked the leader inside rivals in second flight but steadily faded racing into the far turn. AFRAID NOT settled along the inside dropping off the second flight
racing to the backstretch and steadily retreated.
