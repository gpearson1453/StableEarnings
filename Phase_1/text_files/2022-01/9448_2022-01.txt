Footnotes
FROSTED WILD RIDE went to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, inched clear leaving the backstretch, controlled the action along the rail
on the far turn, extended the advantage while set down into upper stretch, remained clear under a drive into the final sixteenth and held while shortening
stride under strong urging. BECAUSEOFTHEBRAVE pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive, kept on in pursuit of the winner in the final furlong, gained on that foe to the wire and finished willingly but missed while clear for the place. S OH S
was well positioned just off the pace, chased inside on the turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. DARIO'S ANGEL was coaxed along
on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, had the rider lose his crop inside the three-eighths pole and failed to rally.
BAD BRETH was bumped in the hindquarters just after the start, dropped back while climbing approaching the furlong marker, went two to three wide on the
turn and was no factor. LONDON GOLD was taken up briefly early then moved out, went three wide under urging on the turn and capitulated.
LORDHEARMYPRAYER broke a bit slow then bumped the hindquarters of a foe and dropped back, settled at the rear on the outside, went around the turn
in the four path and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
JUST RIGHT coaxed from the gate, vied four then three wide outside a pair taking sole command when placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to
three wide for home, drifted out despite a right handed crop and edged clear to the finish kept to task. EASY SHOT three wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home clear for the place honors. SOMEBODY broke out a step
at the start under coaxing, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and improved
position to procure the show honors. ALCOOLS lost his hind footing momentarily at the start and came under hustling to vie from the two path inside a pair
of rivals, made his way to the inside into the turn and came under coaxing three furlongs from home, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened.
MOUNT TRAVERS hustled at the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, tipped out to swing four wide at the top of the
stretch and weakened. BANYAN BREEZE vied three then two wide between foes getting placed to coaxing midway on the turn, spun three wide for home in
retreat and tired in the stretch.

COVER PHOTO established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under coaxing nearing the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, came under threat to the inside, had her main danger get
on even terms a sixteenth out, dug in gamely to prevail on the wire. GENTLE ANNIE brushed at the start by STARSHIP REINA, who broke out a step,
chased three then two wide advancing through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, rallied to issue a challenge
inside the final furlong getting on even terms a sixteenth out, fought on to the finish valiantly but was ultimately denied on the line while well clear of the rest
for the place honors. SHADOLAMO broke in at the start bumping CARTWHEEL in tandem with STARSHIP GODDESS and squeezing that rival back in
between, raced six paths off the inside early on before tucking to the two path with nine-sixteenths to go, tipped out four wide through the turn getting placed
to coaxing near the three-eighths pole, swung five wide for home and kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. AMOS chased four then three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and improved position. STARSHIP REINA broke out at the start brushing GENTLE ANNIE,
chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened. CARTWHEEL got bumped between
foes who each broke her way and was squeezed back at the start conceding four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased along the
inside down the backstretch before tipping out steadily into the turn to be four wide when placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper
stretch and tired. STARSHIP GODDESS broke out at the start bumping and squeezing back CARTWHEEL in tandem with SHADOLAMO, chased just off
the inside in close aim of the leader early on, tucked inside through the turn and faded under coaxing midway, spun two to three wide into upper stretch,
folded, and was eased home to the finish. PADDY'S PRINCESS showed brief speed along the inside, was in retreat through the turn coaxed along briefly
three furlongs out, took the inside route into upper stretch and was eased home to the wire.

HAMMERIN AAMER brushed with a foe at the start while last to commence, settled towards the rear, was roused while moving from three to five wide on
the turn, rallied outside into upper stretch, closed well to make a nearing the furlong marker, was carried out some while dueling outside of the runner-up
from that juncture into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong handling. TWO THIRTY FIVE was urged along on the outside, chased three to four
wide on the turn, gained to make a bid in upper stretch, took the lead outside the furlong marker, drifted out some while dueling with the winner from that
point into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while clear for the place. MEXICAN WONDER BOY broke in at the start, moved out leaving the chute,
advanced to contest the lead with six furlongs to run, vied in the three path on the turn, led into upper stretch, lost the advantage to the runner-up outside
the furlong marker and weakened but was clear for the show. MONEY RIDE disputed the pace on the outside of multiple opponents then between foes
starting inside the three-quarter pole, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, vied inside a foe around the bend, dropped back in upper
stretch and tired. STRIKING SPEED contested the pace between horses, dropped back with a half-mile to run, went two to three wide on the turn and
capitulated. HIEROGLYPHICS settled at the rear, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor.
MUSICAL AMERICA disputed the pace on the inside of rivals, dropped back leaving the backstretch and retreated. MO GOTCHA brushed with a foe at the
start, contested the pace between horses, dropped back near the half-mile pole, raced inside to the two path on the turn and faltered.

from three to five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch under a drive and was along for the place. BOOM ROASTED bumped with a foe at the
start, was urged along off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn and got up for the show. EUDAIMONIA bumped hard with a rival at the start, was
urged along off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch and improved position. UNBRIDLED'S REIGN brushed with a
rival at the start, was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and also improved position but missed the superfecta. ENDLESS CRUSADE

along off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to rally. STRONG ALPHA was urged along well off the pace, went two to three wide on the
turn and never reached contention. ROCK LOBSTER broke a bit slow, was ridden along near the back, raced inside into the turn then came out, moved to
the four path by the five-sixteenths and failed to threaten. SWEETIE PIE was ridden along off the pace, went five then four wide on the turn and was no
factor. HALF BIRTHDAY was ridden along in the front half of the field, dropped back while saving ground on the turn and retreated. LOST ANCHOR
