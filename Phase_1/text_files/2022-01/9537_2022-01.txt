Footnotes
RATIONAL was unhurried early, made a steady advance around the far turn, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished well to just get up
under all out pressure. INFO'S TREASURE tracked the early leader down the backstretch while racing just off the inside, was asked around the far turn,
raced in the two path through the stretch run, led near the wire and just missed in a game effort. FILTHY showed good early speed to set all the pace along
the inside and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. WIN LIKE COACH P was allowed to settle early, raced two to three wide in the lane and had not for
the top trio. RANDOM PLEASURE dropped back early, raced towards the inside throughout and had no response. HEAVENLY ARCH stalked early on and
failed to sustain a bid.

TIM'S BUDDY showed good early speed to set the pace, dug in late and prevailed in a determined effort under all out pressure. MR VIEW stalked the top
pair early, moved up three to four wide and finished gamely to just miss. AL RHYTHM was shuffled back at the break, moved up six wide into the upper
stretch and made a good late gain. BULLET TIMES dropped back early on, raced in the two path through the stretch and had not enough in the drive.
OVER EZ was off slow, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch and had no rally. VIX HERO was hustled early, raced four wide near the quarter pole
and had no late response. VIDAKS BACK pressed the pace from the outside, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and tired. CONFIDENTIALLY
WHO was slow early, raced along the inside through the far turn into the lane and never was a factor. SORRISO was hustled from the inside and tired.
COUNT ALEXEI raced six wide around the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
BULLY BABY stalked the top pair early on, moved up four wide through the lane and finished well to get up under strong pressure. MULLIGAN stalked the
early pace, moved up to challenge four to five wide through the stretch run and finished willingly to the wire. BLACK DROP dropped back early, angled six
wide near the three sixteenths pole and gained ground in the latter stages. OUR LITTLE TIGER was slow early on, moved up six to seven wide through the
upper stretch and made a good late gain. COASTAL RUN pressed the early leader and weakened the final eighth of a mile. ALLIE'S PAL vied for the early
lead along the inside and gave way.
