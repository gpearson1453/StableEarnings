Footnotes
BOOGIE TWO SHOES sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, was headed in mid-stretch by GOLD ROSE and came back to finish
on even terms with that rival. GOLD ROSE was off a step slow, clipped heels, raced just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to take a brief lead into
the stretch, vied wtih BOOBIE TOW SHOES and held for the dead-heat. SIZZLING GRACE was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn
and failed to gain in the drive. AKSARBEN SUMMER chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gradually gave way. MAYBEE A DIVA was void of early
speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. STELLAR WAY settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.

CATS TOUCH lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn, checked nearing the quarter, angled out into the stretch and wore down MAD
LUTHER in the closing yards. MAD LUTHER broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside, opened a clear margin into the stretch and yielded to the
winner late. DYF showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late response. SOUTH FRESNO was off slow, settled off
the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. WICKED FORTITUDE raced four-wide through the first turn, chased the
leaders while racing five-wide and weakened after going a half. KONA COAST was fractious at the gate, disputed the pace while racing three-wide and
weakened after going three-quarters.

Footnotes
BLUE AZUL stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole and held sway to the wire. PLAYOFF
BOUND was reserved just off leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, reached a striking position but could not gain on the winner late. MO
BOB (IRE) settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, drifted out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished evenly. REAL GLITTER
lagged early, raced five-wide through the second turn, checked nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly when clear. THIRTY SECONDS OUT was
void of early speed, saved ground through the second turn, checked into the lane and was not a factor. GORDY'S RULES disputed the pace from the inside
and weakened after going five furlongs. MY COWBOY dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin after going a quarter and
weakened after going five-eighths.

Footnotes
EXETER dueled for the lead with CIBERTRUCK while racing three-wide, vied with that foe through a prolonged drive and proved best through the final
yards. CIBERTRUCK broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner from the inside, vied into deep stretch and gave way grudgingly late. I WILL YEAH
(IRE) settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady rally. WILLTOBELUCKY raced off the leaders early,
moved three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. JAKE THE GREAT chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way in the drive.
MUSKYMAN raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and weakened. HAVEULOSTYOURMIND showed brief speed and
weakened. STEAL HOME steadied nearing the three-quarter pole and did not offer a bid thereafter. WARRIORS HERO jumped the fallen rider nearing the
three-quarter pole, rider lost irons, was pulled up after going three-quarters and vanned off. MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) clipped heels nearing the
three-quarter pole and unseated the rider.
