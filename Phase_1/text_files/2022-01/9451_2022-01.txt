Footnotes
GET NONE trailed the field while off of the rail around the turn, swung four wide and outside of foes entering the lane, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds,
led leaving that marker, and edged ahead late. DOUBLE DARE YOU set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pair of outer pressing rivals
around the turn, shook clear of them entering the lane, but met GET NONE's bid at the furlong grounds, and got bested. BLUES MARY stalked along the
inside, but only managed to chase the leaders through the lane, and prevailed for show a sixteenth out. RANK AND FILE pressed the pace two wide and
between horses around the turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader entering the lane, chased, and got outfinished by an inner foe for show.
NORTHERN ALLIANCE stalked three wide, pressed around the turn, but faded in upper stretch. NO HEAD-ON REPLAY SHOWN.

Footnotes
TENSAS VIRGINIA broke inwardly and possibly bumped the gate while coming out a step slow, quickly rushed to be the clear leader's closest pursuer,
stalked that foe from the outside around the turn, bid at the furlong grounds, and drove clear entering the final sixteenth. ZUMRA BAYOU sped clear early
on, held sway through upper stretch, but was tested by an outer foe at the furlong grounds, proved no match while tiring a sixteenth out, and lasted for
place. EASY ACES broke a step slowly at the start and raced far off of the pace along the inside, shifted two wide entering the lane commenced a rally in
upper stretch, surged inside of BEANIE to claim show late, and was gaining between horses through the wire. BEANIE tracked along the inside, but failed to
progress while chasing off of the rail through the lane, and lost show late. STOP SHOP N DROP tracked the pace two wide around the turn, but tired. PAT
HAND GIRL broke a step slowly and never got involved. BODE'S CONNECTION failed to factor. COME ON BIRDIE was briefly fractious in the gate, then
broke on top, but quickly failed to keep pace with rivals, faded through the field into the turn, and got outrun. NO HEAD-ON REPLAY SHOWN.

WATRUGONNADOKAREN vied for the lead two wide, then from between horses turning for home, fought on between those foes while sustaining vying
position through the lane, and gamely prevailed late. PAYTONSATTHEPLATE took bumps from rivals on either side at the start, stalked the soft pace two
wide, shifted three wide into the far turn to bid at the five sixteenths pole, vied outside of foes through upper stretch, forged a very short advantage at the
furlong pole, but was outgamed by an inner rival late. JUDY'S WAY bumped an inner foe at the start, tracked the soft pace out the back of the short field,
stalked behind the leading trio in the three path around the far turn, tipped outside of them entering the lane, rallied into quick closing fractions as the
leaders held together, attempted a late bid, but did not have enough. TOURRISTA vied along the inside, clung to an advantage inside of a pair of foes
turning for home, but was headed at the furlong grounds, and yielded in the final sixteenth. ZANDREA'S bumped an outer foe at the start, stalked along the
inside, but only managed to chase the leaders through the lane, and failed to bid.

BEHEMAH STAR laid closed up inside of the leader early on, backed off to stalk and set up shop outside of that foe into the far turn, rebid for the lead at the
quarter pole, quickly assumed command at the three-sixteenths, and drew off under vigorous hand urging. DRILLING REPORT set the pace two wide,
cleared into the far turn, but met his once-vying counterpart's rebid entering the lane, proved no match passing the three-sixteenths pole, and was second
best. MARTINIZED settled off of the pace four wide, moved up three wide around the far turn to attempt a bid entering the lane, but flattened out at the
quarter pole, and tired on his left lead. DUSTY BOY tracked along the inside around the first turn, but failed to factor. SHANGHAI RONNIE stalked three
wide, but weakened into the far turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
SWEET BAY tracked three wide, ranged up turning for home to bid at the quarter pole, dueled outside of CANDY ANNE through midstretch, and cleared in
the final sixteenth. CANDY ANNE veered outwardly multiple paths at the start while breaking on top, quickly sped clear, dug in to resist SWEET BAY's bid
while shifting to the two path passing the quarter pole, battled inside of that rival through midstretch, but was bested at the sixteenth pole. MIZ
TROUBADOUR stalked two wide, but was outmoved by an outer foe turning for home, then kept on to secure show. PI YO PRINCESS chased along the
inside, but failed to bid before tiring. HELLO HERO trailed, shifted outside of a trio of foes turning for home, and improved without threatening. TALENTED
TAPPER laid off of the pace three wide, hung on his left lead, and failed to factor while getting outfinished. CANDY CALL bumped an outer foe before being
knocked into by an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, and made little impact. TAPPIN'TIME stumbled before being
forced outwardly at the start, then was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
LADY CLARE stalked the run-off leader from the two path as that foe's closest pursuer, took aim in the four path in upper stretch, grinded away before
drifting outwardly in the final furlong, but sustained a bid for the lead at the sixteenth pole as an outer LADY MAEVE (IRE) did the same, and gamely fended
that foe off to the wire. LADY MAEVE (IRE) bumped an inner foe at the start, rated far off of the pace along the inside, commenced a gain while shifting four
wide around the far turn, fanned to the eight path entering the lane, but sustained a rally through midstretch to bid for the lead outside off LADY CLARE at
the sixteenth pole, but was denied. ZEN (IRE) tracked two wide into the first turn before tucking to the rail around that bend, stalked around the far turn,
chased the clear leader along the rail through midstretch, shifted outside of that foe at the sixteenth pole after outer foes got jumps, then reached show
shortly after, and just held that position from an outer surging rival late. BEE RIGHT bobbled slightly before bumping with rivals on either side while in tight
quarters at the start shifted outside of foes soon after and rushed four wide into the first turn to achieve a midpack position, tracked three wide around the far
turn, shifted to the seven path entering the lane while getting outkicked by an outer foe, then stayed on in the late stages to miss reaching show. CHATON
ROUGE opened up, managed a loose lead around the far turn, held sway through upper stretch, but tired in midstretch, and was overhauled a sixteenth out.
SWIZZLECITY tracked three wide, shifted to the six path entering the lane, but lacked a true rally before being outkicked by an outer foe leaving the furlong
grounds, and flattened out. ALLOCATE settled off of the pace two wide, got oumoved by an inner foe while in the four path around the far turn, then stayed
on late to cut the gap on the leading group, but failed to threaten. CLARA BELLE took a bump to her hind quarters from her outer stable-mate at the start,
trailed the field around both turns, and never got involved. AUNT RUTH got rank through the lane the first time, settled off of the pace along the inside
around the first turn, saved ground, but faded through the lane.

MORE MEMORIES stalked the loose leader two wide, ranged up entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, and drove clear entering the final sixteenth. BIG
CHOPPER set a clear pace, but met MORE MEMORIES' bid in upper stretch, and got bested approaching the final sixteenth. LETSTAKEITOUTSIDE
tracked three wide, but failed to keep pace with the top two in upper stretch, and held show. BRON AND BROW was wrestling with the assistant starter
when the gates opened, was unprepared and stuttered a step at the start, raced off of the pace two wide, chased under urging around the far turn, but
lacked a response, failed to rally, and was unable to reach his outer chasing counterpart for show. COSMIC TRAIN tracked along the inside, and faded at
the three furlong pole. CHEROKEE TAKEOVER trailed early on, and never got involved. MY HEAVY SON laid off of the pace three wide, but was through
after a half mile.

Footnotes
GRAY ATTEMPT hopped at the start, tracked from midpack along the inside, rallied inside of the leader in the final furlong, forged an advantage a sixteenth
out, and held. SEVEN SCENTS tracked three wide, fanned to the seven path in upper stretch to stay outside of the drifting leader, but was outkicked by an
inner rival in the process, then rallied late to reach place in the final sixteenth. HIGH LIMIT ROOM sped clear and set a quick pace while opening up on the
field into the turn, managed that wide lead around the bend, but drifted to the six path approaching the final furlong, and was surpassed by rivals on either
side in the final sixteenth. COLTONATOR saved ground far off of the pace, and improved along the rail to reach fourth late. MAY HOUR stalked in the two
to three path around the turn, chased in the six path through upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, and missed reaching fourth. BEACHCOMBING
trailed three wide, swung to the eight path entering the lane, but made little impact. LAMARTINE (BRZ) raced far off of the pace two wide and between
horses, but played no factor. JACK THE UMPIRE laid off of the pace four wide and never got involved. HOPE AND DIGNITY chased the loose leader from
the two path, but weakened between horses in midstretch.

Footnotes
SPEEDY DUDETTE stalked along the inside, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, bid outside of the clear leader at the furlong grounds, and drove clear
late. SUMITUP set the pace along the inside, shook clear passing the quarter pole, dug in to resist SPEEDY DUDETTE's bid at the furlong grounds, but was
bested late, gave way, but held place. RUE LALA was bumped off stride by an outer foe soon after the start, tracked the pace five wide, but was outkicked
by an inner foe entering the lane, chased thereafter, but missed reaching the early pace-setter for place. PHILLY WINS bumped with an inner foe at the
start, raced off of the pace in the two path, improved inside of foes to claim fourth passing the quarter pole, and finished up evenly. MAGGIE'S RETURN
solidly bumped an outer foe at the start before knocking into an inner rival, laid in the four path far off of the pace, shifted five wide in midstretch, and moved
up. LIL ADEAU was fractious in the gate, saved ground well off of the pace, tipped to the three path in upper stretch, shifted inwardly in midstretch, but
lacked a rail kick. OUR SOUTHERN GIRL firmly bumped with an inner foe at the start, pressed the pace three wide and between horses, but faded at the
five sixteenths pole. RONNIE'S PESO was put to tight quarters soon after the start causing him to be shuffled back, trailed the field in the three path around
the turn, then passed tired foes late. MRS. JUDY raced forwardly placed two wide and between horses, but weakened in upper stretch. BRAVE NUGGET
was restless in the gate, briefly pressed the pace four wide for a quarter mile, but faltered into the turn, then lugged inwardly before wandering about through
the lane. STEPH'S SPIRIT prompted the pace five to four wide and outside of foes, but weakened entering the lane. HALF DIALED bumped with an outer
foe at the start, and got outrun.
