ROMANTICAL NOTE went evenly through the turn firing from the quarter pole emerging in the three path upper stretch edging clear under a drive. BLUE
SAGE stalked the pace rallying to clear along the rail in upper stretch unable to hold under outside pressure late. DEEP DISH stalked the pace vying evenly
down the lane needing more at the end. LELAWALA went evenly coming five wide down the lane mustering enough to best the others. AWESOME
WONDER set a pressured pace through the turn ceding in upper stretch drifting out while fading late. DANCE ON OVER in close between horses would
steady briefly at the break. STORMY BELLA played no factor. HAPPYPLACE a step slow on the outside would tire down the stretch. ZOEYS TOUCH was
never involved.
