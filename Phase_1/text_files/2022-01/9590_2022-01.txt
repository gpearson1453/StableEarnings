Footnotes
FRAN'S STRIKE set the pace in the two path, shook clear near the quarter pole, drifted a bit in upper stretch then straightened out under mostly hand
urging in midstretch and drew off. U U STAR pressed the winner in the three path, was no match for that foe in the lane but dug in inside of DANLEY to win
the place duel. DANLEY prompted the pace four wide, was no match for the winner, dueled outside for the place and just missed that placing.
TAKEMYSHOT failed to menace while racing three wide. TIME OF PEACE chased the pace from the rail, swung out in upper stretch, continued on the left
lead and came up empty. REGIO was outrun inside. TRINNI SURPRISE played no factor while racing three wide. NATHANIEL'S HOPE was in tight and
slammed into the rail not long after the start, plummeted to the rear of the field and never threatened. HOOT GIBSON had brief speed while racing two wide.

Footnotes
KITTEN STREET vied early inside UNPUBLISHED, took over after five furlongs and drew clear under a drive, and was kept to pressure unthreatened
through the stretch. CHUCKY saved ground to the turn, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, and outfinished MR TITO'S for the runner-up spot.
MR TITO'S was well placed just outside the early leaders, had KITTEN STREET get away from him on the turn, and was outfinished for second. MALIBU
MAX moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and had no rally. GODS PROMISE broke a step slowly, raced wide and made no impression. ROYAL
SQUEEZE raced four to five wide, and faded steadily after five furlongs. UNPUBLISHED set the early pace pressured from both sides, could not match
strides with the winner by midway on the turn, and retreated.

Footnotes
PERFECT PICTURE broke readily, held a slim lead over MAGIC PRO in early stages, continued on top under pressure from WORDLY MANNER around
the turn, shook free turning for home, widened to a clear advantage under right handed encouragement and remained well clear. MISCHIEVOUS GUY was
not far back near the inside in opening stages, tipped out two to three wide and launched a bid mid-way around the turn, set down three wide for the drive,
was no match for clear winner but stayed on with solid response and finished clearly second best. WORLDLY MANNER hustled up out of the gate, chased
four wide in range in the early going, moved up two wide to race in close contention around the turn, weakened off the leader turning for home, churned on
two wide then inside in the stretch run and secured a share. SLOE GIN BIZ raced outside in range of the early leaders, chased three to four wide around the
turn, came out wider for the drive and gave way. MAGIC PRO was forwardly placed along the rail applying pressure to the leader in opening stages,
weakened off of rival entering the turn, cut the corner entering the upper stretch and steadily faded. SPANISH NOBLE bumped with rival just after the start,
was slow into stride and raced in the last flight, came two to three wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. CASSIDYS GOLD bumped with rival
just after the start and was slow into stride, raced outside in the last flight, came four wide into the upper stretch and never menaced.

Footnotes
VIVA LA RED tracked the pace from the rail, tipped out near the quarter pole, closed determinedly while drifting out under steady left-handed urging and
was up in the final strides. MINE FOR PASSION set the pace in the three path around most of the first turn, angled in a bit late on the turn, kicked clear
around the far turn, angled to the rail nearing the lane, held clear past the sixteenth pole and was nailed. AUNT NAUGHTY bobbled at the break, raced in
range two wide, angled four wide near the three-eighths pole, lacked the needed rally and was along for the show. RED LIGHT RACER broke in a tangle,
advanced five wide around the first turn, bid three wide nearing the far turn, pressed in the three path around much of that bend but tired in the stretch.
CONFIDENCEINTERVAL failed to menace while racing three wide. UNION TATTERS pressed the pace four wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
HARPER'S IN CHARGE sprinted clear soon after the start, moved off the rail for the drive and kept two pursuers at bay under a drive. STARSHIP NEBULA
moved off the inside to take a run at HARPER'S IN CHARGE approaching the stretch, finished willingly to hold second but could not seriously menace the
winner. THE GREAT KATH advanced after three furlongs in the two-path, moved outside the leaders in the stretch and finished evenly. NURSE JUDY
turned in an even effort three to four wide. THELASTBULLETSMINE gave chase between horses into the turn, shifted to the rail for the drive and had no
rally. ISLAND MAGIC trailed outside.

Footnotes
NIXON JOY (ARG) raced off the pace and saved ground up the backstretch, shifted out approaching the quarter pole, came five wide into the lane,
responded willingly under right handed encouragement and drew clear. FLIPPING FISH was forwardly placed racing just off the leader in early stages,
moved up to engage DIMENNA for the lead approaching the quarter pole, vied outside of rival into the stretch run, battled heads apart at the furlong marker
then shook free, stayed on with response but could not hold off the late challenge from the winner. DIMENNA held a slim lead out of the chute, cleared and
angled inside, showed the way into the turn, took on the challenge from FLIPPING FISH approaching the quarter pole, dueled inside rival into the final
furlong then weakened and held show. SIR KAHN raced four wide in range up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid around the turn, was ridden along
four wide into the upper stretch and ran on evenly. SOSOSUBTLE raced in a bit tight between foes out of the chute, tracked the pace up the backstretch,
hustled up two wide around the turn, stayed under left handed pressure in the stretch run and failed to kick on. FUEGO CALIENTE raced five paths wide
while reserved in the back, came four wide into the upper stretch then drifted out wide and offered no late bid. KING CAIRO stalked along the rail up the
backstretch, failed to progress under pressure around the turn and steadily weakened.

FACE OF VICTORY was hustled to the front, set the pace along the rail, shook clear in upper stretch and held sway under a drive. AEQUOR pressed the
winner two wide, could not match strides in upper stretch but stayed on willingly to the place. YOU'RE KILLIN ME settled off the pace outside, raced three
wide between foes around the turn, rallied outside and just missed second. UNCORK THE BOTTLE had his head turned at the start, raced off the pace four
wide and lacked the needed rally. GAME BOY BENNY chased the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. YOUCANTCATCHCURLIN trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HOT PEPPERS was bumped lightly between horses at the start, vied early outside AMAZING TRIP, put that one away after three-eighths of a mile, moved
inside for the drive and widened under pressure. RAPTUROUS was ridden along near the back around the turn, saved ground into the lane and rallied to go
clear late for the place. ADIAMO bumped lightly with HOT PEPPERS at the start, raced three to four wide around the turn, and lacked the needed closing
kick. AMAZING TRIP was hustled from the gate to contest the pace inside HOT PEPPERS, could not match strides after three furlongs, and faded in the
stretch. KAEKO was outrun two to three wide. POIEMA bumped lightly with HOT PEPPERS at the start, eyed the battling leaders in the clear early, and was
empty leaving the turn.
