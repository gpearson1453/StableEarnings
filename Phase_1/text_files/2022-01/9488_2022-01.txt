Footnotes
BELLA DONA set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, opened up and was best. RUNNING FOR GRACE tracked the early pace, raced
seven wide though the turn, was no match late and finished second best. REAL ME pressed the early pace, went four wide into the turn and weakened late.
DELIA raced in mid pack early, went five wide into the turn and offered no late rally. INDIAN EXCELLENCE was unhurried early, raced nine wide into the
turn and never fired. FOXY RED was void of any early speed, raced between rivals and was no factor. SHELLY D'ORO was outrun early, raced along the
inside and was no threat. SUERTUDA was reserved early from between rivals and faded. SUNNY JEWEL was allowed to settle early, raced six wide into
the turn and tired.
