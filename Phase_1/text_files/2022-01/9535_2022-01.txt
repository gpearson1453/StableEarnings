SEA EMPEROR was void of speed, advanced nine wide through the turn, was gaining, took control and edged clear. SOUTHWESTERN HOPE pressed the
early pace, raced eight wide into the turn, drifted out, was no match late and finished second best. KRIS WHO set a pressured early pace, raced five wide
out of the turn, kept on and weakened late. DIABOLICAL RULER was allowed to settle early, made a six wide middle move and flattened out. DESERT
DANGER stalked the early pace from the inside and tired. FRANKS DEHERE was off a step slow, raced along the inside and was empty.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI MIKE was outrun early, raced six wide intro the turn, took a brief lead, met the bid of FABOZZI, dueled to the wire and prevailed. FABOZZI was
unhurried early, raced seven wide through the turn, made a bid on the winner, dueled to the wire and just missed. PLEASE THE COURT tracked the early
pace, raced five wide into the turn, eased back through the turn and re-rallied. COWBOY TOBY pressed the early pace, raced six wide into the turn, took a
brief lead and faded. NICE WORK stalked the early pace from the inside and tired. MORO APPEAL reared at the start, was reserved early, raced between
rivals and offered no rally. SAMURAI JACK was taken back and was no threat. RINESHAFT set a pressured early pace from off the rail and gave way.

Footnotes
CANYON DEL ORO set a clear early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, opened up and drew off as an easy winner. FANTASY SUITE chased the early
pace, raced three wide into the turn, was no match and finished second best. ELUSIVE ACCOUNTING tracked the early pace, raced six wide into the turn
and was empty late. WHISKEY THERAPY was allowed to settle from between rivals and flattened out. MINISTERTOMYHEART was void of any early
speed, angled out through the turn and offered no late rally. BE COOL IF YA DID was reserved early from between rivals and faded. SHACKEY'S LOVE
was unhurried early, raced seven wide and never fired.
