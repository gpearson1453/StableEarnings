E J'S REVENGE vied for the early lead three wide, then dueled for the lead with SPIN CYCLE to the furlong marker, then slowly edged clear in the furlong
grounds to prove best under a drive. SOLAR WARMING broke in the air at the start, then was rated along and was on the inside on the backstretch, eased
off the inside on the far turn and came three wide into the drive, finished well late to gain the place award at the wire. SPIN CYCLE was off slowly, then
stalked the early pace before moving up to duel for command by the five eighths marker on the inside, then continued that duel to the furlong marker and
gave way grudgingly, lost place award at wire. BUILT THAT WAY stalked the early pace five wide, then chased the pace four wide on the far turn and then
was slowly gaining late. CATTLE DRIVE stalked the early pace four wide and weakened. FLEET IRISH was void of early speed then found best stride late.

while making a move, then rallied well in the stretch but could not get to the winner late, second best. ROYALBONNIELEGACY chased the early pace and
was four wide on the turn, angled in leaving the turn and had no kick, held show award. TUXEDO LEMON was reserved early, raced five wide down the
backstretch and six wide on the far turn, came seven wide into the drive and had a mild late rally. MOMENTS TO SAVER chased the pace three wide and
lacked the needed late rally. GRACEYGAB was well placed on the inside and tired. THANXFORLASTNITE set the early pace while three wide and stopped

TRENDING UP stalked the early pace and raced on the inside on the turn, then tipped out three wide leaving the turn for aim on the front runner, made a
bid and went on even terms by the sixteenth pole and then drew clear late to prove best under a drive. JOJOMAR set the pace and was well handled,
remained clear by the furlong marker but was headed by the sixteenths and stayed on to be second best. RIPPOLINO was allowed to settle early, then was
on the inside on the turn and had a mild rally on the inside but needed more. ST. PADDY'S DADDY was rated along early on the inside, then moved to the
outside on the turn and came six wide into the lane and had a belated rally for the minor rewards. THIS ILL DEFEND chased the pace three to four wide,
came five wide into the drive and had no kick. PRATT stalked the pace three wide and came four wide into the drive and came up empty. SWEEPIN HARD
failed to menace.

Footnotes
KIRBY set a pressured pace early, then vied for the lead on the inside on the turn, made a bid leaving the turn and shook clear then held sway to prevail
under a drive. GRAY LOLLIPOPS tracked the early pace and made a four wide move on the turn to vie for command four wide by the quarter pole but hung
in the drive. COUNTESS SHANAKILL lunged at the start and was off slowly, then settled in the back, advanced five wide on the turn, came seven wide into
the drive and closed well late. QUEEN'S DREAM was allowed to settle early, made a five wide move on the turn and was slowly gaining late but needed
more. MAGICALLYDELICIOUS pressed the early pace three wide, made a bid on the turn and vied for command between horses by the quarter pole and
weakened. ABOVE THE LINE tracked the early pace three wide, then moved to the inside on the turn and swung out three wide for the drive and had no
rally. SUPER BELLE was well placed early on the inside, then stopped while getting out in the drive.
