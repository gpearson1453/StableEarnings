Footnotes
EXPONENTIAL was unhurried racing in then back, circled up closer along the outside late on the far turn, coaxed six wide into the lane, dug in under steady
pressure and kicked clear. MEAN MACHINE raced off the early pace, was ridden along four wide around the far turn, vied for the lead past the furlong
marker then lasted for place. ROYAL WAR secured inside position around the first turn, tracked the pace up the backstretch, sat patiently late on the far
turn, raced in traffic in the upper stretch, shifted out four wide for a clear path and gained in late stages. WINDY CITY RED set a pressured pace up the
backstretch, dueled for the lead around the far turn, battled on to the furlong marker then weakened late. SOUPER FORTUNE rated inside through early
stages, launched a rail bid into the lane and chased evenly. SMALL REASON settled off the early pace, came five wide into the lane and failed to move on.
SPECIAL MEISTER stalked up the backstretch, dueled around the far turn and faded in the final furlong. HARDREDCANDY prompted the pace up the
backstretch, dueled for the lead around the far turn and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
MERZAZ was bumped between foes at the start, prompted the pace two wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, drew clear near the quarter pole
and widened under a steady drive. ZIGGY set the pace along the rail, was collared by the winner near the five-sixteenths marker, angled out when that foe
cleared turning for home and stayed on to hold the place. BILLY YANK was bumped just after the start, chased the pace inside and was along for the show.
SANDY DUDE was bumped just after the start, tracked the pace two and three wide and lacked a closing bid. ONLYAMATTEROFTIME played no factor
while racing two wide around most of the turn and swinging six wide near the quarter pole. NEVERENOUGHCOCO broke inwardly and bumped MERZAZ
into BILLY YANK into SANDY DUDE, was up close three wide down the backstretch and was done after a half. MACEDONIAN bobbled at the break,
dropped far back early, advanced widest down the backstretch, went four wide around the turn and was through early.

TIME TO TWO STEP bumped with SHADILEE at the start, set the pace in the two-path, and widened under a drive. SHADILEE bumped with TIME TO
TWO STEP at the start, pursued the pacesetter between horses on the turn, and kept on with good courage inside LUNAR BLAST to get up for second.
LUNAR BLAST was taken off the inside early, raced three to four wide around the turn, and was outfinished for the place. MISS ITALY trailed inside to the
turn, swung four wide approaching the stretch, and finished evenly on her left lead. GYPSY WIFE never made her presence felt. QUEEN DOMINA was
hemmed in along the rail around the turn, and was empty when clear.

Footnotes
MISS YOU ELLA stalked inside up the backstretch, angled out and roused four wide into the lane, steadily edged up closer under right-handed pressure
and got up in time. STAR OF INDIA tracked the pace two wide up the backstretch, loomed three wide late on the far turn, hustled along turning for home,
lugged in greenly on her left lead in upper stretch, dueled outside of GOLDEN BELIEF, stayed on determinedly between horses and got caught on the wire.
GOLDEN BELIEF held a slim lead around the first turn, set a pressure pace up the backstretch, dueled for the lead through the far turn, rider lost the crop
mid-stretch, continued to battle gamely inside of STAR OF INDIA into deep stretch then lacked a final kick. HOT BODE raced two wide around the first turn,
remained unhurried up the backstretch, was ridden along three wide into the lane and had a mild improve. CULDEE steadied around the first turn, raced off
the top two flights up the backstretch, urged inside heading into the lane and failed to kick on. MAGIC LIGHT applied pace pressure to GOLDEN BELIEF
through early stages, dueled for the lead through the far turn, continued in striking distance turning for home then checked sharply when STAR OF INDIA
shifted in a path upper stretch and dropped back. AMAZING MSKITTY raced three to four wide into the first turn, raced off the pace, saved ground through
the far turn and had no response.

Footnotes
GLIDER settled off the pace while racing two wide around the first turn, advanced four wide around the far turn, angled in in upper stretch, seized command
inside of the pacesetter leaving the eighth pole and powered clear. SOSUA SUMMER set a clear pace in the two path, drifted out in upper stretch, was no
match for the winner in the final furlong but held clear of the rest. ROADTRIPTONOWHERE had his head turned at the start, raced well back two wide,
advanced three wide around the far turn and was along for the show. DARK AND FITZY chased the pace three wide around the first turn, moved a bit closer
while saving round around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. ANDY CANT lagged inside, swung six wide near the quarter pole and improved position.
NEVER SAY KNOW (IRE) stalked the pace in two and three wide, angled in in upper stretch and weakened. FIERY HEART tracked the pace two and three
wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and came up empty. DEFENSIBLE was fractious in the starting gate and made little impact while racing two
wide. FREDO steadied into the first turn, saved ground and never threatened. CHUCKA MOON was fractious in the gate, steadied while appearing to try to
get out around the first turn, raced two and three wide and played no factor.

DIAL TO WIN saved ground in easy striking range early, moved off the rail with a quarter-mile remaining, overpowered MISSING LINK from outside at the
top of the stretch and drew off under a drive. DESIGNED BY KITTEN circled five wide leaving the turn, rallied outside and clearly bested the remainder. MY
MASTERPIECE moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and offered a mild response to go clear for the show. KITTEN'S COVERGIRL pursued the
leaders three wide to the stretch, and weakening while attempting to lug in. MISSING LINK set the pace inside, was no match for DIAL TO WIN turning for
home, and gave way. SAMMY'S TOWN chased two wide early, and faded before reaching the stretch. PATRICK'S LASS moved inside approaching the
turn, and remained far back.

Footnotes
HOT PEPPERS cleared on top soon after the start, continued with the advantage inside through the turn, cut the corner entering the stretch run, responded
willingly under a strong hand ride and drew off. DOVE IN CHARGE raced off the second flight heading into the turn, coaxed inside into stretch run,
sustained a steady inside bid through the lane and captured place. WILDCAT STAR was ridden along in range through the turn, coaxed five wide into the
lane, stayed on with response and got edged out for place. ADIOS BABE hustled up two wide around the turn, angled out wider past the furlong marker and
needed more for late impact. CHITIENNE was forwardly placed out of the gate, remained forwardly placed behind the lead around the turn, drifted out
turning for home and steadily weakened. ULTIMATE BREEZE raced in the last flight five wide through the early going, came in a couple paths into the turn,
was ridden along three wide into the lane and had no response. GOLDEN ISLE chased three wide in range through early stages and retreated late on the
turn. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

Footnotes
STARSHIP NALA pressed the pace two wide, took over nearing the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and just lasted under a drive. FOUR
GRACES tracked the pace two wide between foes, tipped out in upper stretch, rallied between foes and just missed. MISS T TOO raced off the pace two
wide, angled four wide in upper stretch and closed widest. MON PETIT CHOU was in range inside, stayed on the rail through the stretch and lacked the
needed rally. HEIRESSALL set as pressured pace inside of the winner and weakened through the lane. COMPENSATE was outrun inside. MUSIC CITY
STAR was a bit rank down the backstretch, raced in range three wide, drifted out nearing the lane and retreated.

Footnotes
SOVEREIGN OF SPEED angled in from the outside post and prompted the early pace, cleared on top at the head of the lane, widened to a clear advantage
under steady pressure and remained clear. PERFECT PICTURE raced inside near midpack, tipped out and hustled up around the turn, sustained a steady
two to three wide bid through the lane and cleared second best. PHILZANO tracked the top flight into the turn, coaxed four wide into the lane, stayed on with
response and secured a share. IRISH KING got bumped and steadied strides out of the gate, raced off the early pace, came five wide into the lane and
improved position. MY BROTHER MIKE raced inside into the turn, tipped out two to three wide for the drive and chased on evenly. BOUND LUCKY broke
in, got bumped and forced to steady at the start, raced off the pace, came four wide into the lane and passed tiring rivals. LEE ANN'S WARRIOR set a
pressured pace through early stages, got overtaken by the winner in the upper stretch and weakened. THOUSAND LETTERS raced off the early pace, cut
the corner into the lane and lacked a needed rally. HEART OF ROMAN was ridden along the outside through early stages, came three wide into the stretch
run and never threatened. MIMI'S BEACH HOUSE raced in range around the turn and faded in the lane. SPANISH NOBLE took a solid bump at the start,
raced in the back and had no response. SOCIAL REVOLUTION lacked speed, came five wide into the lane and never menaced.
