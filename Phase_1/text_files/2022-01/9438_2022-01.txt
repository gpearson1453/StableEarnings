Footnotes
GOLD WING, reserved along the inside racing into the turn, saved ground through the turn, gained position gathering momentum inside foes nearing
midstretch, tipped off the inside and produced a solid late response to surge past I KICKN in time to prevail under pressure. The latter angled inwards in
early stages to force the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn, edged forward to a clear advantage leaving midstretch but couldn't fend
off the winner. HOT AND HEAVY, urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset to the stretch, yielded leaving the furlong marker while prevailing
for a share. FIVE STAR CREEK tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, was prompted to advance nearest the rail approaching the
stretch, then shifted out racing through the lane but had no rally. MR. EDGAR was rated off the second flight racing to the turn, angled out in upper stretch
but had no closing bid. SUNSHINE CHARLIE tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn, shifted out three deep racing into the lane, but
steadily faded. SOURCESANDMETHODS was off slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
STERLINA moved readily to the lead under light rating in the opening stages, dictated the pace just off the rail racing into the turn, held sway past
midstretch and just lasted to finish on even terms with DOLCISIMA at the wire. The latter angled inwards while being rated off the second flight on the
backstretch, steadily gained position splitting foes leaving the turn, then reeled in the pacesetter through the final furlong to finish on even terms at the wire
under firm right handed encouragement. READY TO RUMBLE was rated behind the second flight along the inside racing to the turn, tipped out in upper
stretch and continued with interest to improve position to the end while earning a share. ANAHIYA'S DREAM tracked just off the pacesetter inside rivals in
second flight racing into the bend and weakened in the drive. QUEEN'S BEST tracked the pacesetter in the three path as part of the second flight racing into
the turn, continued in that path to upper stretch but had no closing bid. BALLYMENA tracked the pacesetter four wide as part of the second flight racing into
the turn and faded in the drive. BEAUTIFUL ROSALIA settled between foes in the opening stages and offered no rally. SECRETIVE MISS, caught five wide
on the backstretch, came under pressure to maintain contention nearing the turn but soon dropped out.

Footnotes
JOE PHILLIPS was urged to a forward placing along the rail stalking just off the pacesetter leaving the chute, came through inside that foe to contest the
lead entering the far turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch and held CREATIVE CHOICE to the end in a prolonged drive. The
latter was urged to the lead while angling over racing to the first turn, dictated the pace just off the inside through the backstretch, was headed by the winner
racing through the far turn, then lost some ground to that foe in upper stretch but grudgingly contested the issue in a prolonged drive to the wire. ASSERT
DOMINANCE, forwardly placed tracking just outside the pacesetter to the backstretch, was urged to challenge shifting out three wide on the far turn but
lacked the needed final kick. POSEIDONS MYTH tracked the leaders three deep behind the second flight to the far turn, was fanned four wide into the lane
and finished evenly late. RAMIRIN reserved outside foes racing to the backstretch, swung out entering upper stretch and continued with interest to improve
position. TUTANKHAMUNATCHA tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide entering the lane but had no
rally. GRUNDER angled inwards to race between foes well off the second flight racing to the far turn and offered no rally. PONGO LOUIE, off slowly, then
pinched back at the start, tracked off the second flight flight along the inside to the backstretch but faded early. COACH PAUL, held up along the inside in
the opening stages, tracked just off the second flight along the rail racing to the far turn and came up empty in the drive. KING FORCE tracked off the
second flight between foes racing to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
HIMELSTEIN was urged inside a rival disputing the pace in the opening stages, dispatched that foe entering the bend, dueled for command racing a bit off
the rail through the turn to upper stretch on a narrow advantage and maintained a safe margin to the end under firm handling. SARASOTA BOY was rated
three deep racing just off the leaders to the turn, continued with a steady bid to challenge the winner in that path racing into upper stretch but proved only
second best. POSEIDEN was rated between foes just off the leaders racing to the turn, angled to the rail to bid inside the pacesetter neaing upper stretch
but was outkicked by the top pair. STRONG ENDING was rated from just out of striking distance along the inside racing to the turn, swung out four wide
nearing the lane and continued with an even effort. OVERPRAISE, reserved off the leaders racing in the four path on the backstretch, was prompted to
make brief progress in that path racing into the turn but emptied our nearing upper stretch. CASTLE KING settled near the inside racing to the backstretch
and never gained contention. DRAMATIZED angled inwards to prompt the pacesetter in the opening stages but gave way early. SAINT BENEVOLENCE
was never a factor.

Footnotes
IN ITALIAN (GB) sped to the lead on her own courage while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin while under light rating through the
backstretch, was prompted to go clear racing into upper stretch, widened the margin under a few right handed taps and held sway on a comfortable margin
to the end. KITTEN TALES tracked just off the leaders while angling to the rail racing into the first turn, continued along the inside into the second bend and
came through inside foes in upper stretch to prove best of the others. JEAN V'S LEGACY, reserved near the inside racing well off the second flight in the
opening half, steadily gathered momentum on the far turn, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch and continued to improve position. JOYOUS
TIMES, in touch with the pacesetter stalking that rival under firm rating in the opening half, was prompted in pursuit of that foe nearing the lane but gave way
between foes midstretch. MAP THE MOMENT was settled last along the inside to the backstretch, angled four wide racing into the lane but had no rally.
WORLD TOUR tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight racing to the far turn and steadily retreated nearing the lane.

Footnotes
PALMGIRL tracked just off the leaders three deep between foes in the opening stages, continued under patient handling conceding some position racing
into the turn, shifted inwards to split rivals just off the inside nearing upper stretch, bid for command along the rail entering the lane and drove clear.
LYRICAL, carried at the out start, continued unhurried five wide behind the second flight, was prompted to advance in that path entering the turn, gained
terms with the leaders four wide racing into upper stretch and finished with interest to prevail for the place honors late. IZSHEFROSTED joined the pace
three deep in the opening stages, shifted inwards nearing the turn to gain the advantage, disputed the lead between foes into upper stretch but weakened in
late stages, then was vanned off the course following the race. GONE DREAMING tracked off the first flight inside rivals, then shifted out to race between
foes nearing the turn, shifted out three wide on the bend to press the pacesetter between foes nearing upper stretch but flattened out nearing midstretch.
TRULY AMBITIOUS tracked off the first flight three wide in early stages, was fanned four wide racing through the turn and faded between rivals entering the
stretch. DE PURA SANGRE ducked out at the start momentarily impeding LYRICAL, was settled outside foes on the backstretch and never proved a
serious threat. PROSPETTIVA D'ORO was urged inside rivals prompting the pace through the backstretch, was taken up avoiding tight quarters entering
the turn and soon gave way. THATS JUST HEARSAY, urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, dueled inside a rival entering
the bend and gave way racing into upper stretch.

Footnotes
GOLDEN ROCKET broke readily to race on terms outside the leaders through the chute, eased off the pace, then worked her way to the inside nearing the
backstretch to track behind the second flight, saved ground into the second bend, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, shifted out entering the
lane to race five wide past the furlong marker but produced a smart rally to wrest the advantage in time under firm encouragement. BIG TENTATIONS
angled to the inside early tracking just off the first flight to the backstretch, advanced through close quarters nearest the rail approaching upper stretch,
wrested the advantage entering the lane, shifted out while being roused to resist the winner's challenge in the closing stages but proved only second best.
CAPETOWN CANDY was rated outside rivals tracking off the first flight to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while being fanned four wide nearing
upper stretch and couldn't match the top pair while prevailing for a share. SONG OF THE HEART settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to split foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch gaining some position but lacked the needed final kick. ENDLESS was
urged prompting a rival's pace from the outset to the far turn, was carried out racing into upper stretch and quickly gave out. RIPLEY EFFECT, off slowly,
tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the far turn but offered no rally. WICKED GAL settled last while angling to the inside on the backstretch
but never gained contention. JEWEL OF WINTER, urged along the inside disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn, drifted out racing into upper
stretch carrying out several rivals and abruptly gave out entering the lane.

Footnotes
DR. ANN was urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter through the backstretch, continued with a steady bid to close the gap midstretch, prevailed under
right handed pressure leaving the sixteenth marker and was taken in hand nearing the wire. NOTHINS FREE was urged clear of the field racing a bit off the
rail through the backstretch, held sway on a comfortable advantage to upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum. MIZZEN AIR tracked the
pacesetter three wide from just out of striking distance racing into the turn and continued evenly in the closing stages to edge a rival for a share on the wire.
HUSH Y'ALL shifted off the inside racing past the chute to track just off the second flight, angled inwards racing past the half mile marker and continued
evenly inside a rival to late stages while missing for a share. LEA ME ALONE, slow to gather stride, never gained contention. SPIN CLASS dropped out
early.

MINNESOTA LUCKY sped clear of the field while angling over nearing the first turn, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin in hand through the
backstretch, then was roused left handed to maintain that margin through the stretch, holding sway to the end to prove best. TOSS broke inwards bumping
GO HIPPO GO, was reserved well off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance splitting rivals three deep nearing midstretch
and proved best of the others. KING ANDRES tracked the pacesetter outside rivals in second flight racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside entering
the far turn and kept on well enough to prevail for a share. CROI MOR was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the far turn, tipped out
entering the lane but offered no rally. JOJO'S DREAM hopped at the start bumping JUPITER BLUES, was held up inside foes behind the second flight in
the opening stages, switched outside foes on the backstretch to race three deep to the second bend and steadily faded into the lane. GO HIPPO GO,
bumped, then squeezed back at the start, raced last to the far turn and passed only tiring rivals. THREEOHTWOCASSIE was rated tracking the pacesetter
inside a rival as part of the second flight to the backstretch and steadily faded after a half. JUPITER BLUES, off slowly, then squeezed between rivals at the
start, switched outside foes racing to the backstretch, continued three, then four wide into the lane and proved empty in the drive.
