Footnotes
OUTSIDE THE LAW settled off the leaders from between foes, moved four-wide through the turn, responded when set down for the drive and up with a rush
to prevail in the closing yards. J T'S LA NENA set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by RIVER JUMPER nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, vied with that rival but could not resist the winner from over the top. IN THE RED was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the
turn and finished with good late energy. RIVER JUMPER pressed the pace of J T'S LA NENA while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that rival
nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied and gave way in the drive. RAIDERETTE was bumped at the start, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn
and finished evenly late. DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out approaching the stretch and was not
a factor. M FAST was bumped at the break, showed no early speed, saved ground throughout and did not threaten. LAST PUNCH chased the leaders while
racing five-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
MINISTER OF SOUL stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to engage nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lead with a sixteenth
to run and drew off through the closing yards. ANNIE'S BOY sprinted clear at once, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the five-sixteenths
pole, vied with that rival and gave way through the final sixteenth. HEY PILGRIM was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn
and finished evenly late. EL CHAVO DEL OCHO was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor.
TIZHOTNDUSTY lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. DARNQUICK chased the leaders while racing three-wide and
weakened after going three furlongs.

five-wide through the second turn and finished with good late energy. SWAMP SOUFFLE was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the second

Footnotes
THEY'RE GRRREAT drew off on the first turn, set the pace to the second turn, was headed and carried out leaving the turn, dueled through the stretch and
proved best in a long drive. SHAKELAS DESTINY broke slowly and was crowded at the start, raced mid pack, closed steadily, was gaining ground and got
up late for place. AUTISM SAVANT rallied on the turn to assume command, swung out leaving the turn, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished in a
good effort. LOOKIN FOR GOLD advanced inside on the turn, closed steadily and didn't have enough late. NORTH FORK was unhurried early, rallied
around the turn, bid and came up empty late. MONTANA JACK was outrun in an even efort. LAZARUS COME FORTH showed speed to the second turn,
tired and gave way. CAPPER was not a factor. LT. BULLITT showed good early speed while racing inside, was through after a half, stopped and was not
urged late. WED O'S CHAMP pulled up and was vanned off.

Footnotes
I'M LEAVING YOU vied inside, inched clear at the top of the stretch and held well in a driving finish. CHEST CANDY stalked the pace while racing inside,
angled out on the turn, bid willingly, didn't have enough late and finished second best. AUDACE was unhurried early, rallied inside on the turn, closed
steadily and got up for show while no threat to the top two. DILLON ROCKS raced close to the pace, bid inside on the turn to be within striking distance, had
little left and hung late. STITZY raced between horses, vied to the turn, weakened and faded from contention. VICENTE'S SHADOW raced in the back,
angled out for the drive, offered a mild bid only and did not threaten. MAD AT MONEY was outrun in an even effort. OPTIMISTIC VALOR showed speed to
the second turn and flattened out. FINAL ROSE pressed three wide to the turn, leveled off and dropped back. OSTINI trailed the field and failed to contend.
