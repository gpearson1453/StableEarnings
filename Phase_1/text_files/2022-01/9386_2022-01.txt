Footnotes
ARCHER'S HALL was well rated early, eased out to make a four wide move on the turn, took over leaving the turn and drew off in the stretch to prove much
the best under a mild drive. RUN LAURA RUN dueled for the early lead and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole but proved to be no match for
the winner in the drive, second best. SPUNKY ZOEY dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened in the drive, lasted for the show award. LOIS'S
CAUSE was settled and early and chased the pace five wide on the turn and came six wide into the drive and offered no rally. FINE ENTHUSIASM chased
the pace from the inside and swung out four wide for the drive but offered no rally.

PRATT was allowed to settle early on the inside, then made a inside bid leaving the far turn to gain a short lead by the furlong marker and then held on
gamely to prove best under heavy left handed crop urging. SIMMONS was allowed to settle early while three wide, then made a five wide bid leaving the
quarter pole, shifted in by the sixteenths pole and was gaining late but needed more to just miss. PIGGYBANK was reserved early, advanced on the far turn
and came five wide into the driver and had a mild late rally. COOL COMEDIAN set the early pace and then vied for the lead on the inside on the
backstretch, came off the inside leaving the turn and faded in the final furlong. ALL TACKED UP tracked the early pace four wide, then went up three wide
to vie for command by the five eighths pole, then continued to vie for the lead leaving the turn four wide, was bumped nearing the furlong marker and faded.
ECONOMIC POWER was reluctant to load, then stalked the early pace three wide and then was getting out badly and stopped.

GALILEE broke in the air at the start, then was settled in the back, advanced towards the inside on the turn and eased out to be three wide by the quarter
pole, then angled in leaving the furlong marker to close well up the inside to get up in late to prove best under a drive. DIXIE CANNONBALL dueled for the
early lead and made a bid leaving the turn to shake clear, but was caught late while saving the place award. FICTIONALFAIRYTALE dueled for the lead
three wide and kept on to the wire to just miss the place award. SPOOKY ONE was reluctant to load, tracked the early pace, made a four wide bid on the
turn but hung in the drive. MY MAN GEORGIO was allowed to settle early and made a mild bid on the turn and came five wide into the drive but had no late
kick. DEB'S GUNFIGHTER lacked a rally. SACHMO failed to respond. MR DUBAI showed some speed four wide early and stopped.

Footnotes
COOS BAY set a pressured pace while racing off the rail, drew clear on the turn and then widened the margin leaving the turn and remained clear to prove
best, driving. SCREEN STAR lunged at the start and was off slowly, then advanced on the turn on the inside, tipped out three wide for the drive and finished
willingly to be clearly second best. GEM JUAN was settled back early while five wide, then came seven wide into the drive and had a belated rally. PHIL
THE BANKER chased the early pace two wide and weakened. HAPPY GUY was reserved early and was three wide on the turn and had no rally.
COMMUNICATION FAIL pressed the pace three wide and weakened. DREAMING OF LOVE chased the pace four wide and stopped.
