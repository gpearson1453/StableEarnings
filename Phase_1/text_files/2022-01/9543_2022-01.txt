Footnotes
THAT'S BIND BABE stalked the pace outside of rivals to the turn, mounted a five wide bid into the stretch, took command into the final furlong, was firmly
urged while on the left lead, was confronted in deep stretch by GOBSMACK and just lasted in the final strides. GOBSMACK settled off of the early quick
pace while two wide, mounted an inside rally into the stretch, confronted THAT'S BIND BABE inside of the final sixteenth and was denied the win while clear
of the rest for second. HYPERSONIC pressed the pace into the turn, lost ground on the turn while two wide between rivals, chased the leaders into the
stretch and went by tiring foes in the late going to claim third. ELUSIVE VIRTUE was away in good order and showed good early speed while setting quick
fractions into the turn, was collared by the winner inside of the furlong marker and gave way in the late stages. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET was a bit slow into
stride in the early going, gained ground along the turn, tipped out to the two path for the drive but could not keep pace into the stretch run and was empty in
the final stages.

second turn, was given a left-handed reminder leaving the furlong marker, ducked in a bit in the final stages but was clear at the wire. DIMMI QUANDO
stalked the pace to the second turn while two wide, chased the winner into the stretch and could not make up ground in the late going but was well clear of
the rest. AWESOME CURLIN was allowed to settle in the early going while outside of rivals, was three wide on the second turn and offered a mild late gain
in the stretch run. HANDSOME HUSSAR was allowed to settle in the early going while saving ground, made a mild gain into the stretch and weakened in
the drive. NATIONWIDE PRIDE stalked the pace from the midflight, was two wide on the second turn and gave out in the late stages.

Footnotes
DASHING DEMI was bumped at the start and was away a bit slowly, settled at the rear through the second turn while saving ground, rallied along the rail in
the final furlong, engaged REMEMBER SUE approaching the sixteenth-marker, bumped with that foe when that one drifted in and outdueled the runner-up
in the final stages. REMEMBER SUE tracked the early pace while saving ground, mounted a three wide bid along the second turn, swung out to the five
path for the drive, took command into the final furlong, met the bid of the the winner nearing the sixteenth-marker, drifted in two paths in mid-stretch and was
outdueled by the winner to the wire while clear of the rest. ROCK N ROLL SONG pressed the pace to the second turn, lost ground into the stretch and gave
way in the late going though was an easy third. CHELINA saved ground while stalking the pace in the second flight and weakened in the stretch drive.
ROUSING YOU BABE settled just off of the pace to the second turn and did not offer a late rally. BRITTANY BREEZE was away alertly and cleared the field
into the first turn to set the pace, was pressed to the second turn by ROCK N ROLL SONG, felt pressure nearing the top of the stretch and faded in the late
stages. NIZHONI YEE tracked the pace from a two wide path through the backstretch run, lost ground on the second turn and tired in the drive. THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT BETWEEN DASHING DEMI AND REMEMBER SUE OCCURRING AT THE
SIXTEENTH-POLE AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF FINISH.

CHULA GIRL stalked the pace to the turn, gained ground while two wide on the turn, steadied in tight quarters leaving the five-sixteenths marker, was boxed
in upper stretch, angled out for the drive and closed fast in the late going and drew clear in the end in a good debut. TAM TRICKY tracked the early pace to
the turn, gained ground while three wide on the turn, was three wide between foes into the stretch run, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker and was
outfinished in the final stages, while holding for second. LASSIE CAT was a bit slow in the early going and trailed into the turn, swung widest into the stretch
and rallied well in the late going while on the left lead to earn the nod for third. SAVAGE LOVE saved ground while chasing the pace, steadied in tight traffic
on the turn and did not have a late kick in the stretch run. TROPICANA GIRL was sent leaving the break to duel with ARTISAN DANCER on the front end,
came under pressure leaving the turn and weakened in the drive. ARTISAN DANCER was away alertly and disputed the early pace with TROPICANA
GIRL, was confronted by TAM TRICKY in upper stretch and tired in the late stages. DON'T TELL HYDEE was forwardly placed to the turn while outside of

the late going but kept on to secure third. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS was three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace outside of rivals to the second turn,

Footnotes
BACK RING LUCK was hustled leaving the break to dispute the pace on the first turn then took back to prompt the pace to the second turn, mounted a two
wide bid to confront TED leaving the second turn, was firmly urged through the final sixteenth, wore down TED in the late going and dug in to hold off the
oncoming runner-up. MANILA MISCHIEF was allowed to settle through the early stages, was steered to the three path along the second turn, angled out
five wide nearing the furlong grounds, closed fast in the late going and just missed for the win while securing the place. TED was away alertly and was sent
to set the pace while being prompted by BACK RING LUCK, was headed by that foe nearing the furlong marker, battled back and stubbornly kept on until
the final stages while just holding on for third. LOAFERS BOY saved ground while sitting just off of the pace through the second turn, improved position
leaving the second turn, was blocked in mid-stretch and closed well to just miss for third. OF GOOD REPORT settled outside of rivals through the
backstretch run, mounted a four wide rally on the second turn but lacked a late final kick in the stretch. FUENTE (GB) stumbled at the start and stalked the
pace outside of foes from the second flight, gained ground on the second turn while four wide and into the stretch but was outkicked in the final furlong. ON
RAGLAN ROAD was forwardly placed while tracking the pace outside of rivals, gained a bit of ground on the second turn while three wide and gave way in
the late stages. NOWHERE MAN was a bit slow leaving the break and was unhurried through the second turn, mounted a two wide rally leaving the second
turn and closed on the leaders but could not make a late impact.

Footnotes
MOB BOSS was away alertly and took back to prompt the pace through the turn, mounted a two wide bid leaving the turn to confront the runner-up, headed
DUDE IT'S A PARTY inside of the furlong marker, wore him down and held safely in the end. DUDE IT'S A PARTY was sent to set the early pace to the
turn, was prompted through the turn by MOB BOSS, was firmly urged through the lane and could not hold off the winner but was best of the rest. HEAVEN'S
MUSIC chased the early pace from a two wide path and closed well in the stretch to dead heat for show. CHIEF WILD EAGLE chased the pace from the
second flight, swung widest into the drive and under firm handling offered a good late rally to share for third. TIZ A THRILL tracked the pace while saving
ground on the turn, was still within aim leaving the bend and was outfinished in the late going. NORTH SEA chased the pace from a four wide path on the
turn and did not offer a final bid in the stretch. GALLANT OAK stalked the pace while outside of foes to the turn, lost ground into the stretch and weakened
in the drive. BID ON THE PRIZE was bumped at the start and was a bit slow in the early going, was three wide while trailing on the turn and lacked a late
rally in the stretch run. FRISCO KID had no early speed while saving ground through the turn and was not a factor. BLUE SILVER was away alertly, ducked
in at the gap, was pulled up and walked off under his own power.
