ON A WHIM rated close off the rail, challenged leaving the three eighths pole and moved to even terms in the three path midway on the far turn, then dug in
determinedly to edge out the game effort of A BIT OF HARLOW, who rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and was
met at even terms nearest the rail midway on the far turn, dueled gamely through the lane but relented the final yards. MEGALODON'SREVENGE settled
off the pace about the three path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn in the three and four paths, then flattened
stride the final sixteenth. GHOST MINE saved ground racing well off the pace, bid mildly leaving the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn.
CAYATANO stalked the early pace from the three and four paths, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole then weakened off the rail on the far turn. IL MIO
REGALO raced with the early pace two deep but dropped back past the three eighths pole and faded from the five sixteenths. TAKE A SWING saved early
ground, eased outward into the backstretch then faded toward the far turn.

Footnotes
I'D LIKE TO KNOW accelerated to the lead nearing the three eighths pole and rated the pace, came under pressure into the turn and was steadily
encouraged to hold on. HARTEL came away sharply and engaged in close chase leaving the chute, had range on the leader in the three path through the
turn and finished well to gain on that one. RICHIE'S B L had a brief early lead then gave chase from the three eighths pole, ran in the four path of the turn,
dug in through the lane and just lasted in third. NATIVE COURAGE gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn mostly in the three path,
angled to the six path toward the eighth pole then just missed in the stretch duel for third. ZIP THE LIP chased, ran in the five path of the turn, was carried to
the seven path toward the eighth pole and raced evenly through the lane. DOESN'T MAKE CENTS gave close early chase, ran at the rail on the turn then
flattened inside the eighth pole. TANELEER gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail and showed little further. COSA MAS LINDA chased from the
outside, rounded the turn in the six and seven paths then weakened. MAGIC OF LOVE raced well back and was eased the final quarter. This race was hand
timed.

was kept alert through the stretch. GALILEAN MOON rated close inside, bid toward the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn, eased out entering
the stretch and finished evenly. GRECIAN ADMIRAL stalked off the rail then challenged leaving the three eighths pole, dropped back toward the quarter,
was carried out leaving the far turn then flattened stride. LUFTY'S KISSES settled off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, ran in the four
path of the far turn and showed little further. NAUTICAL WARRIOR stalked in the three and four paths the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole then
flattened at the rail on the far turn. STEP OUT DANCING saved ground after being shuffled back at the start, and showed little response through the

SHOOFLY PIE settled off the pace in the four and five paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead two deep past the quarter and was steadily
handled to hold on well. MAGNIFICENT ROCKET saved ground on the first turn and settled off the pace, bid toward the three eighths pole, raced off the rail
on the far turn, took second past the eighth pole but couldn't improve in the lane. LIL PERFECT settled off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths
pole, ran in the five path of the far turn and came along for third later yards. SILVER AND BLUES clipped the heels of the errant Nicky D soon after the start
and rounded the first turn about the five path, left the turn outside, bid toward the three eighths pole, raced in the six path of the far turn and could only
improve her position. CASTLE'S TUFFY rated off the early pace in the three path, was met while between horses at the three eighths, gave chase toward
the five sixteenths but flattened in the three path of the far turn. NICKY D came in and had her heels clipped by Silver And blues early on then rated the
pace inside, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, was caught at the rail past the quarter pole and gave way in the stretch. CLASSY JEAN
steadied between horses into the first turn, rounded the turn in the three path and never factored. LAURA'S GRAND was not a factor.

EISELE stalked in the three path the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn then dug in from the head of
the lane to get up the final strides. MIO GRACELAND took the lead and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearest the rail
approaching the quarter pole, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but was caught in the final strides. TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS stalked off the rail
then gave chase from the three eighths pole, remained close off the rail on the far turn and stayed on to deep stretch before relenting. A FAREWELL
YODEL settled off the pace inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and raced evenly through the lane. AZURE FIRE
saved early ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole and ran in the four path of the far turn, then passed rivals in the stretch. PONTICELLO rounded the
first turn in the four path, bid into the backstretch but faded in the three path of the far turn. WEAVINTHEBLOCKS broke a step slow and rounded the first

MY PRETTY EYES pressured the pace three wide while between horses, contested at a close disadvantage two deep into the turn, moved to even terms
toward the head of the lane and dug in determinedly to win the nod late yards. JUBA'S HOUSE set a pressured pace inside, contested the edge nearest the
rail into the turn, was met toward the head of the lane and dug in gamely to deep stretch before relenting late yards. EYE OF THE NEEDLE chased through
the backstretch, ran in the three path of the turn and finished well while gaining on the top two. I'M A TOTAL DIVA broke awkwardly and in to make contact
with STROLLNTOTHEBANK then gave chase inside, angled to the six path on the turn and passed rivals. The latter was bumped off stride soon after the
start then pressed the pace two deep while between horses, raced at the rail on the turn and flattened the final furlong. BRONZE DIVA pressured the early
pace four wide but dropped back leaving the three eighths pole and weakened in the four path of the turn.

BIG BOY POTTS pressured the pace through the backstretch and dueled to the lead two deep at the quarter pole, drew clear mid turn and was steadily
handled in the lane. RUN TO DAYLIGHT chased toward the inside, ran in the three path of the turn and dug in to take second later yards. UOTTALIKEIT set
a pressured pace inside, was caught at the rail at the quarter pole, dropped back midway on the turn and flattened the final furlong. ROLL DEM BONES
chased outside, rounded the turn about the four path and passed rivals outside. GOODLUCKWITHTHAT engaged in close early chase off the rail but
dropped back leaving the five sixteenths pole and flattened at the rial on the turn. CAIRO CALLING gave close early chase then weakened in the three path
of the turn.
