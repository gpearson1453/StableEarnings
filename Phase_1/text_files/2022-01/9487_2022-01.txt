Footnotes
RIO OCHO (IRE) cleared early and moved to the inside, controlled the pace in hand, pressured from outside past the half-mile pole, maintained a short lead
through the second bend, then shook free in upper stretch and held safely in the end. FLINTMORE was off step slow and broke in a bit, unhurried in the
early going at the back and moved inside, saved ground to the stretch then steered out and put a late run to earn the place honors. ONCOMING came away
a step slow, tucked inside on the first turn, tipped out into the stretch and got outkicked for second. FLINT STROLL stalked along the inside then went
between rivals on the first turn, bid outside past the half-mile pole, kept the pressure on through the turn, drifted in and almost made contact with the winner
in upper stretch, then weakened in the furlong grounds. DANIEL'S MAGIC stalked two wide then got pushed out to the three path on the first turn, chased
two then three wide on the second bend as well and lacked any response in the late stages. JUST ABOUT ENOUGH coaxed from the gate, went two to
three wide around both turns and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
ISSA COURT stumbled at the start, chased inside then shifted to the two path and went up between rivals to press the pace, lost contact with the leader
after four furlongs, gained ground on the far turn and took aim two wide into the stretch, drew alongside DELTA WIND in midstretch, then took over at the
sixteenth pole and inched ahead late. DELTA WIND broke alertly from outside, pressured around the first turn and into the backstretch, cleared nearing the
halfway point and inched away, showed the way along the inside into the lane, challenged again by ISSA COURT in midstretch, lost command with a
sixteenth remaining and stayed on well. ROSE'S CRYSTAL bobbled leaving the gate, traveled three wide early, angled out to the four path and passed a
pair of rivals on the second bend, came three wide into the drive, finished willingly in the lane but was unable to threaten the top pair while well clear for
third. GOTTA BE LUCKY chased two then three wide on the first turn, went three then four wide on the second bend and came up empty. SECRET
SQUARE got fanned four wide on the first turn, dropped to mid-pack on the backstretch, crept closer nearing the far turn, started to weaken around the
bend, eased in the stretch and walked off. BIG MAMA SUE chased a bit off the rail, dropped back in the middle stages, eased leaving the backstretch,
pulled up early on the far turn and walked off.

Footnotes
MENDHAM MILL was off alertly to take the front, set all the pace on the inside to the stretch, challenged by M IS FOR MAGIC at the eighth pole, drifted out,
floating that rival out in the process and held gamely. M IS FOR MAGIC stalked between foes into the turn, chased outside a rival in the two path to the
stretch, bid outside the leader with a furlong left to run, got floated out by that foe and could not get by. WHAT A FEELING stalked the pace from inside,
paused briefly behind the leader at the quarter pole, started to drifted out then was angled out past the eighth pole, drifted out a bit further after and held he
show. LAURA MARS (IRE) broke slow and stumbled badly at the start, chased along the inside, advanced and tipped to the two path around the bend, got
bumped by VIGILANTIA in upper stretch, moved out a bit by inside rival in the lane and kept on willingly. VIGILANTIA tracked off the rail, went three wide
into the turn, angled to four path around the bend, came three wide into the lane, drifted in and bumped rival in upper stretch and flattened out. SHE SHOT
ME DOWN dropped back early, got blocked behind SINNERS SAINTS at the five-sixteenths pole then steered to the inside on the turn and could not rally.
SINNERS SAINTS stalked three deep early, dropped back around the bend and tired. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND A RIDER'S OBJECTION FROM
THE RIDER OF M IS FOR MAGIC AGAINST MENDHAM MILL, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH THERE WAS INCIDENTAL CONTACT
BETWEEN THESE RIVALS IN THE STRETCH, THE INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION.

Footnotes
GERLACH'S broke a step slow then went up to press the pace from outside, took over in upper stretch and kicked clear. BOLD VOYAGER brushed inner
rival at the start, stalked the top pair to the turn, gave chase three wide around the bend and got up for second. PERFECTO AMOR sped to the front, set the
pace under pressure to the stretch, lost command in upper stretch and flattened to third. LIGHTNING FAST stumbled leaving the gate, steadied off heels at
the seven-sixteenths pole, raced along the rail then two wide into the drive, moved out a bit midstretch and could not rally. SOMETIMES ALWAYS settled off
the rail, traveled two wide into the turn, angled out and entered the lane four wide and never threatened. MONGOL ALTAI broke slow and got brushed from
outside leaving the gate, raced three wide at the back into the turn, moved out and came five wide into the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MY SUMMER DREAM stalked off the rail then steered down to the inside, came out and bumped bumped rival twice past the five-sixteenths pole, took aim
two wide into the lane, drew alongside in upper stretch and drove clear late. SAI CON (FR) showed speed from the rail position, remained unchallenged into
the stretch, was tested with a furlong remaining and yielded to the winner. DIXIE'S TWO STENTS chased off the rail up the backstretch, traveled two wide
then angled to the rail leaving the turn, moved off the fence in the drive and finished willingly to gain ground late. WEEGEE tracked outside a rival early on,
steadied off heels at the three-eighths pole, bumped with CARDOZA late on the bend and kept on earn a minor award. EXIT ROW was closest in pursuit to
the outside of the lone leader early on, stalked two wide into the turn, got bumped by the winner twice past the five-sixteenths pole and weakened down the
lane. STING LIKE A BEE got brushed from inside at the start, chased along the rail into the turn, cut the corner into the stretch and failed to menace.
CARDOZA trailed early, went three deep into the turn, bumped with rival leaving the bend and weakened. THERE WAS A RIDER'S OBJECTION PLACED
BY THE RIDER ABOARD EXIT ROW AGAINST MY SUMMER DREAM FOR INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS
RULED THAT BOTH RIVALS CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHAGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

DEL MAR DRAMA was off alertly then ceded control and was well placed behind the top pair, bid three deep with a quarter mile left to run, took over leaving
the turn and kicked clear. LITTLE RACHEL dueled for the lead from inside, vied with a pair of rivals past the quarter pole, could not keep pace with the
winner in upper stretch but was clearly second best. LITTLE MISS ELLIE stalked the speedy pair from inside, eased out to the three path late on the turn
and edged SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH for the show. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH stalked the pace well off the rail, took the turn four wide and lost the photo to
LITTLE MISS ELLIE for third. ROSES R BLUE sent for the lead from outside and dueled with LITTLE RACHEL for command into and around the turn, vied
between leaving the bend and weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
WISHTHEYALLCOULDBE tracked widest up the backstretch, bid four deep on the turn, fought with the runner-up in the drive and drove past in the final
sixteenth. SMITTEN BY KITTEN broke a bit slow, brushed with rival at the nine-sixteenths and was crowded a bit soon after, angled four wide leaving the
bend and rallied late to get up for second. MUCHA WOMAN set the pace with company to the outside, lost the lead past the three-eighths pole, regained
command approaching the quarter pole, carried a short lead into deep stretch, was overtaken by the winner and got edged for the place. LI'L GRAZEN was
off a bit slow to begin, brushed with rival at the nine-sixteenths pole, saved ground through the turn and lacked a late bid. SHANGHAI SUNRISE raced up
close three deep then outside a rival, lacked room and steadied late on the turn, angled out in the stretch but could not summon the needed rally. HOT
RAGEOUS pressed from outside, vied between and took a short lead past the three-eighths pole, lost the lead nearing the quarter pole and weakened.
SATURDAY HEIST broke out, vied three deep for command on the turn, bobbled in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
CONSTITUTIONAFFAIR sped to the front and set the pace early on, met the bid from NILES CHANNEL on the far turn, cleared that rival at the top of the
stretch and held gamely in the closing moments. LIBERAL (IRE) settled in the two path early, angled three wide on the far turn, tipped out to the four path in
the stretch, rallied but was too late. IRISH HEATWAVE angled to the inside early and sat off the pace, split foes at the five-sixteenths pole then tipped three
wide leaving the turn, closed well in the late stages and earned the show. NILES CHANNEL stalked in the two path, bid outside on the far turn, lost contact
with the winner at the top of the stretch but stayed on through the final furlong while getting outfinished for the place and show. FLY TO MARS stalked along
the inside throughout and needed to find more in the final furlong. HAPI HAPI was unhurried in the early going, checked behind FLY NIGHTLY on the first
turn, angled to the inside for the second bend, came two wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. FLY NIGHTLY traveled in mid-pack three wide on the first
turn, moved closer and outside the top pair nearing the second bend, lost ground and exited the turn four wide and tired.
