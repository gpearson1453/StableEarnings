Footnotes
LIFE'S EMOTIONS bobbled at the start, chased leader along the inside, shuffled by rival entering the turn, eased out into the two path, ranged up on leader
at the top of the lane and drew off well. LASYA DANCE away clean, and dropped back on the backstretch, saved ground into the turn and went three wide
in the stretch, rallied well enough to earn second. TRIPDOWNMEMORYLANE stalked pace along the inside, continued along the inside on the turn, had to
pause and wait for room approaching the quarter pole, found room late in upper stretch, dueled for second to the wire and edged. TIERNA showed good
speed, cleared rival entering the turn, headed late on the turn, kept on in upper stretch and finally faded inside the final sixteenth.
