Footnotes
LONG CROW void of speed, asked along midway on the second turn, began to rally soon after, five wide when roused into the lane, closed with good
resolve to be up in timie. BRODY'S STREAK broke toward the front, worked way out to three wide by late in the first turn, stalked the leader up the
backstretch, took over from that one midway on the final turn, clear into the lane, could not contain the winner while remaining clear for the place. SILENT
DISCO last to leave, raced in the back with the winner, came four wide out of the final turn, rallied well off the inside to be clear for the show and to be
closing the gap on the runner up. DEALMEINBUD settled in mid pack well off the inside, three to four wide in the second turn when moving closer, chased
the runner up past midstretch and flattened out. GALACTIC EMPIRE angled in through the first turn, went one paced throughout in lacking a closing kick.
SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY broke well, set a lively early pace, clear before a half, faltered when headed by the runner up in the second turn while in the two
path. CATCH THE SMOKE four wide through the first turn, failed to menace. REQUISITION off the pace while saving ground, in some traffic while
remaining inside through the second turn, two path into the stretch, failed to rally when clear. AQUITANIA ARRIVAL dueled up front through a quick opening
quarter, chased in the run up the backstretch then began to stop after a half.

Footnotes
TWISTED DIXIE in the second flight off the inside, ranged up when asked to challenge three wide late in the turn, drew clear past the furlong marker, kept to
task to the wire while increasing that advantage. BELLAMYS ROAN dueled up front closest to the inside, offered little resistance to the winner through the
stretch, edged clear for the runner up spot. ROLL DINERO ROLL dueled up front while racing off the inside, also proved no match for the winner in the
drive, weakened a bit late to lose contact with the runner up, remained far clear of the others. POINT BLANK void of early foot inside, continued to save
ground turn, improved position through the stretch while never a threat to the top three. JACKS SPRING BREAK went one paced three wide, lacked closing
kick. ROLLIN N THE MONEY off slowly, moved up steadily the opening quarter, steered out in the turn, went evenly through the stretch. MY KINDA TETON
saved ground to no avail. RIANTE SKY four wide trip throughout, failed to rally. COINCIDENTAL broke up front, chased the dueling leaders for four furlongs
along the inside, faded through the stretch. MOONSHINE SURFER dwelt at the start, raced three wide and was never a factor. STARR'S MISCHIEF was
never close. MACHO APPEAL mid pack, lost action into the turn, pulled up in apparent distress and was vanned off.

Footnotes
CATHOLIC GUILT allowed the pace to go early, began to advance after, lodged a rail bid midway on the final turn, dueled past the furlong marker closest to
the inside, edged clear late under firm handling. EASTSIDE COOL closest to the leader, advanced and challenged three wide and between foes with a
quarter mile remaining, dueled outside the winner past midstretch stretch, could not match that one late, remained clear for the place. TILLIS unhurried
while racing toward the inside, came in the two path when moving a bit closer out of the final turn, shifted out for the drive, along for the show down the
middle of the strip. GREAT FACES settled off the early pace, loomed a threat four wide turning for home, flattened out in the run to the wire. BIG THORN
moved up the inside to sprint clear before a quarter, expanded that advantage through a quick opening half, offered little resistance when challenged
midway on the final turn. SHOFAR broke back, lacked speed, turned in an even effort while racing three wide. GENERATOR remained always back and
was never a factor. ALL WEST off a step slow, was also always outrun. THE ROCK SAYS reluctant to load, stopped after a half, fell far back and was
jogged in.

Footnotes
TOMA TODO forwardly placed after breaking on top, stalked the leader off the inside up the backstretch, collared that one from the outside midway on the
final turn, shook clear into the stretch and increased that advantage under steady handling. ASSUMPTION also forward early, saved some ground through
the first turn, moved out to be three wide backstretch, moved closer in the far turn, proved no match in the drive for the winner while holding sway for the
place. BEACHWALKER raced in mid pack while four down to three wide in the first turn, continued outside, mild rally while drifting in a bit stretch, slowly
getting to the runner up late. FAY DAN reserved early toward the inside, continued to save some ground in the second turn, waited then steadied along the
rail turning into the stretch, improved position a bit in the rail while not posing a serious threat. RIFT VALLEY void of speed, continued back into far turn,
angled out to be four wide turning for home, picked off a couple of tiring foes down the middle of the strip. MEGA MAX void of speed, never threatened.
ONE LAST HAND last away, was used to move up the inside past the wire the first time, clear before a quarter,continued to set the pace the middle half
mile, faltered when headed midway on the final tur4n. SPEIGHTSTOWN AGAIN settled in mid pack, stopped three wide out of the final turn, distanced after
quickly losing contact with the field, jogged in.

DEVIL'S TOWER with the pace from the start outside, vied three wide through the turn, shook off the other speed when straightened for home, held the
runner up safe late under steady handling. MOLTO VIVACE off a step slow, moved up to race closest to the three vying leaders, steered out, came three
wide into the lane, roused, slowly getting to the winner late. MARVIN settled off the pace and the inside, raced three out to four wide late in the turn, staged
a mild rally out in the strip to annex the show. SAG HARBOR lacked speed, came in the two path out of the turn when still in mid pack, steadily steered out
through the stretch to improve position slightly. RIDE RICHIE RIDE with .the pace along the inside, appeared to get out slightly to bother BRAD'S TIME
when beginning to weaken turning for home, continued to falter in the run to the wire. BROTHER AARON lacked any early foot, two path through the turn,
improved slightly through the stretch as well without posing a serious threat. BRAD'S TIME vied between horses for a half, appeared to be bothered slightly
when RIDE RICHIE RIDE came out a bit exiting the turn and then gave way. REEF'S DESTINY well back early, made little impact. OPUS EQUUS fell back
to trail after the start, passed tiring rivals. O DOGG hesitated at the start, four wide through the turn, remained back. BATTLE OF MEMPHIS (IRE) staged a
steady retreat three wide. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF BRAD'S TIME AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ENTERING

Footnotes
A C EXPRESSWAY broke back, lacked any early foot, saved some ground turn, steered out a bit then dropped back to the rail to slip through entering the
stretch, split foes past the furlong marker and drew clear. RIBBONS AND MEDALS unhurried early in the two path, also dropped to the inside for room while
in front of the winner exiting the turn, challenged along the inside past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner, game for the place. TANGO
CHARLIE with the pace from the start inside, narrowly showed the way through the turn closest to the inside, edged clear of the other speed while moving
out for the drive, also was not a match for the winner while outside that one late, outkicked for the place. HERD IMMUNITY last to leave, trailed for over a
half, three wide into the lane, dropped to the inside nearing midstretch and improved position. U. S. STEEL behind the first flight toward the inside, in traffic
while in the two path exiting the turn, came up empty when clear for the drive. DEFLATER raced in mid pack while outside, four wide entering the stretch,
lacked a closing kick. ALL THE DIAMONDS lacked early foot, fanned five wide out of the turn, also failed to muster a rally when called upon. COLD AS
HELL with the pace for four furlongs between horses, gave way in the drive. MONEY MIKE set or forced the issue up front on the outside for a half and
stopped.

Footnotes
DOCTOR LOVE off slow, raced back and off the inside, came six out to seven wide when advancing out of the turn, rallied down the middle of the strip to be
in time. DRAG MALIBU with the pace from the start inside, vied closest to the rail into the turn, fell back off the leader late in the bend, tipped out, rebid, led
late, could not quite contain the winner late in giving ground grudgingly to that rival. SUMMER IN MALIBU forward and firmly in hand in the run up the
backstretch while in traffic, continued behind the leaders turn, once again encountered traffic issues late in the turn and through upper stretch, up for the
show when clear. AMITY ROAD lacked early foot outside, four wide exiting the turn, improved position while remaining well out in the strip.
ONYOURMARKGETSETGO broke on top, dueled outside the runner up in the run up backstretch, larger lead in the turn and into the lane, faltered in the
late going while along the inside. CAMARGO void of speed racing just off the inside, asked along turn, improved position through the lane while not a
serious threat. MILLARD'S SMILE off a step slow, raced well back, displayed a modest amount of late interest in picking off a couple of rivals. TREATY
within striking distance early outside, moved closer four wide late in the turn then tired in the drive. HELLEPHENT fractious while loading, pressed the issue
three wide for a half and faltered. MR FROST off slow, moved up to race in mid pack well out in the strip, five wide into the turn, three wide exiting, faded.
CLASSIC SHINE within striking distance early, steadily faded three wide. COASTAL CHAOS fell back after the start and was never involved.

Footnotes
MAN IN THE CAN broke well, cleared in the two path through the first turn, rated kindly in the run up the backstretch, cruised around the far turn and was
not threatened in the drive under token encouragement to win ridden out. SOUIXPER CHARGER forwardly placed along the inside, tapped on the brakes a
bit when in tight first turn, asked along and angled out three wide, proved no match for the winner through the stretch, fully extended to prevail for the place.
K J'S NOBILITY lacked speed off the inside, angled out steadily to be four wide late in the final turn, late bid for the place position, outkicked. DINNER AT
CRUMPIES closest to the winner three wide, chased that foe up the backstretch and into the far turn, asked for run soon after, little in the way of a
response, weakened through the lane. IMPLICATOR off a step slow, raced back and off the inside, three wide through the final turn, improved slightly in the
drive while not a threat. MO BETTA made little impact while racing toward the inside. FIVE O ONE broke out but alertly outside the winner, fell back in mid
pack, had little for the drive. HAMAZING WISDOM steadied when breaking in and being a bit tight, trailed throughout in showing little.

stalked the early leaders four wide through much of the first turn, continued outside, advanced on the first flight four wide second turn,came five wide into
the lane when putting a head in front, proved no match for the winner when straightened for home, narrowly saved the place. TONALTALITARIAN off a step
slow, raced back and outside, mild rally three to four wide out of the final turn, getting to the runner up late. SPORTS FAN settled off the pace and the
inside, came four wide into the stretch when mounting a modest rally, flattened out in the final furlong. REVENIO in hand after the start, raced well back and
toward the inside, two path second turn, three wide into the lane, improved position a bit in the drive without posing a serious threat. GAINER one pace
inside, in slight traffic when angled out into the two path into the stretch, failed to muster a late kick. LAKE NAKURU off a step slow, raced off the inside,
steered out to be five wide late in the final turn, passed tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. CHARLIECANDO broke on top, prompted the issue
early, took over in the three path, faltered when headed by the top two entering the stretch. GEORGIA DEPUTY raced back and was never a threat. BUGLE
OF WAR raced in mid pack off the inside, had little for the drive. JUSTIN'S QUEST set the pace for five furlongs along the inside and gave way. GRAND
DESIGN pressed the issue early, vied midway up the backstretch, stopped far turn.
