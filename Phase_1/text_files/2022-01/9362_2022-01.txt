Footnotes
RESERVENOTATTAINED vied early inside POINTER and FINANCIAL SYSYTEM while in the two-path, shook clear into the stretch shifting out further, and
widened well off the rail. LUSITANO saved ground through the opening half-mile, moved out widest for the drive and was up in the last strides outside
FINANCIAL SYSTEM for second. FINANCIAL SYSTEM contested the pace outside rivals, got shaken off by the winner after straightening away for the
drive, and yielded second late. AWESOME BEACH brushed with OLD TIME REVIVAL away from the gate, then steadied as POINTER came over in front of
him, moved inside and posed no threat. POINTER vied up front between rivals early, and was finished midway on the turn. OLD TIME REVIVAL brushed
with AWESOME BEACH shortly after the start, and tired outside after a half.

Footnotes
SCALDING broke alertly, dueled inside UNEXPECTED while in the two-path early, began to edge away after six furlongs, went clear into the stretch and
widened under pressure. ABUNDANT HONOR raced three to four wide throughout, had aim at the leaders on the far turn, could not reach SCALDING
through the lane, and just saved the place. CHROME REPUBLIC had a ground-saving trip, finished willingly on the rail and just missed second.
UNEXPECTED pressed SCALDING from outside for six furlongs, and stayed on his left lead weakening through the stretch. TONAL IMPACT trailed near
the two-path for six furlongs, came wide for the drive and was empty.

Footnotes
NOVO SOL (BRZ) settled off the early pace four wide, edged closer four wide around the far turn, moved to the front nearing the eighth pole and drove
clear. LONESOME FUGITIVE (IRE) raced two wide in midpack, went three wide around the far turn, angled five wide turning for home, bid outside of the
winner in midstretch but was second best in the final furlong. REGAL SPEAKER raced off the pace two wide, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied between
foes to gain the show. SIGRUN FAST BOY was in range inside, bid between foes in midstretch but was outkicked. GINSBURNED was unhurried while
racing three wide early, angled five wide near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and never threatened. ARTURO TOSCANINI (IRE)
saved ground and failed to menace. PERFECT SILENT CAT played no factor while racing three and four wide. RICOCHET set the pace in the two path and
tired in the drive. ANOTHER DUKE lacked early speed while saving ground, made some progress five wide around the far turn but lacked a closing bid.
LOUDER THAN BOMBS stalked the pace in the clear in the three path, led in upper stretch and wilted.

PANOTTI saved ground advancing on the far turn, bid along the rail into the stretch, outdueled CAPSTONE GIRL entering the final furlong and drove clear.
CAPSTONE GIRL tracked inside to the far turn, moved out three wide to challenge outside EMIRATES AFFAIR approaching the stretch, could not match
strides with PANOTTI coming to the furlong grounds and ran on clearly second best. ROSA STAR prompted the pace in three-path to the far turn, and
lacked a solid closing response. MISS MAMBA was three wide early, moved inward through the middle stages, and failed to menace through an even effort.
CHECK TWICE broke a step slow, had the rail trailing into the far turn, and could not reach contention. ANONYMOUS SOURCE was always outrun.
EMIRATES AFFAIR moved in from the four-path clearing the others on the first turn, remained a bit off the inside showing the way for six furlongs, then
gave way between horses turning for home.

OFFICER COUNTRY raced off the early pace, steadied entering the turn, angled four wide soon after, closed widest, swept to the front nearing the eighth
pole and drew off with authority. ZAMFIR pressed the pace in the four path, took the lead in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane, was
collared leaving the eighth pole and held second. MONY was in range inside, tipped two wide near the eighth pole and was along for the show. PERSONAL
MEADOW set the pace in the two path and tired in the lane. BEINFUN never threatened while racing two wide. HUSHED HIJINKS pressed the pace
between foes and faded nearing the lane. BIG CITY RED trailed inside.

Footnotes
RAPTUROUS dropped back to last after an alert beginning, trailed into the turn outside, put in a five-wide run to contention approaching the quarter-pole,
rallied steadily on the far outside through the lane and drew clear after catching SEA ART a sixteenth out. SEA ART dueled inside AMAZING TRIP early, got
the best of that dispute after a half-mile and went clear into upper stretch, could not withstand the winner late but bested the others. ROSY APPLE broke a
step slow, recovered to a forward position in the two-path, shifted out four wide at the top of the stretch, but could not gain. AMAZING TRIP pressed SEA
ART from outside for better than a half-mile, and weakened in the stretch. SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL raced three wide on the turn, moved inside for the drive
and could not threaten. CANDYMEISTER raced inside to upper stretch, moved to the far outside past the eighth-pole and was empty.
