Footnotes
MEDINA MAN pressed the pace from a two wide path to the quarter-marker, wore down the pacesetter inside of the furlong marker and edged clear in the
end. THE CALABRESE KID saved ground while stalking the top pair on the turn, tipped out for the drive and closed well in the stretch under firm urging to
secure second. SPLIT ACES was away well and set the pace while being pressured by the winner, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and was
outfinished in the end but kept on to claim the show. INTO BOURBON saved ground while unhurried early, was a bit green and erratic in upper stretch while
improving position and offered a mild late bid in the final sixteenth. UNCLE DANNY chased the pace while outside of rivals and weakened in the stretch run.
SIERRA SNOW STORM was unprepared at the start and was away a bit slowly, chased the pace from a four wide path on the turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE LOVE saved ground while stalking the pace through the turn, angled out to the three path for the drive, was firmly urged and closed well in the
final sixteenth and was up in time to prevail. BOURBONWITHATWIST sat just off of the early quick pace, mounted a three wide bid leaving the turn, wore
down the tiring pacesetter leaving the furlong grounds, led into the late stages and was tagged in the final strides while besting the rest. LUCK IS GOLDEN
stalked the pace from a two wide path, was boxed and lacked room leaving the turn and in upper stretch, was steered out a path in the final sixteenth and
made a mild gain but was unable to reel in the top pair. LUCAS MCCAIN was away well and was sent to set a quick pace while being pressured, shook free
of the pressing rival and led into the final furlong but was caught nearing the sixteenth-marker and weakened in the late going. LASTBESTHOPE settled off
of the pace into the turn while two wide, improved position into the stretch and was outkicked in the drive. EXCESSIVE CAT was hustled leaving the break
to dispute the early pace, gained a bit of ground on the pacesetter nearing the quarter-marker and gave way in the late stages.

WEARENOTBADPEOPLE bobbled at the start and recovered to stalk the pace to the turn, saved ground along the bend, angled out leaving the turn,
confronted the leading pair inside of the furlong marker and dug in in the final strides to prevail. NICKEL NICKEL NINE tracked the early quick pace from a
two wide path, steadily gained on the pacesetter nearing the quarter-marker and into the stretch, was set down for the drive and vied for the lead in the final
sixteenth but could not hold off the winner while clear of the rest. SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS was away well and showed good early speed while carving out
fast fractions through the turn, felt pressure inside of the furlong grounds, was caught at the sixteenth-marker and gave way late, while clear for third.
LEMON DROP SHOT chased the pace to the turn while outside of rivals and weakened in the stretch run. LEAVEITONTHEFIELD chased the pace from a
four wide path to the turn, was outrun heading into the lane and was not a factor.

Footnotes
KEEP ON DANZING was a bit wide on the first turn while stalking the pace, was given rein along the backstretch and pressed the pace to the second turn,
was asked for run nearing the quarter-marker, took command into the stretch and pulled away in the end. WOLF MOON WILSON was allowed to settle in
the early going, mounted a four wide rally along the second turn, was outkicked by the winner but kept on in the stretch to secure second. EVEN STEVEN
tracked the pace inside of foes, was two wide on the second turn and was outfinished in the stretch run, while well clear of the rest. FLOYD KNOWLES was
away in good order and was sent to set the pace, was pressed through the backstretch run and into the far turn by the winner, was overtaken by KEEP ON
DANZING nearing the top of the stretch and tired in the late going. NORWESTER was four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace outside of foes into the
second turn and gave way in the stretch run. WELL CRAFTED settled just off of the pace while saving ground, gave ground on the second turn and faded in
the stretch run.

Footnotes
RINSE AND REPEAT settled toward the rear of the field in the early going while outside of foes, circled the field while seven wide in upper stretch and
surged in the final sixteenth to prevail. SUNSET DRAGUNN saved ground while tracking the pace along the turn, angled out in the drive, closed under firm
handling and just missed in the end while earning the nod for second. STONE GROOVE was sent to dispute the early pace, took control from PRINCE DE
PRINCE into the turn, had a clear lead along the bend and into the stretch, came under pressure in the final sixteenth and was tagged in the final strides
while clear of the rest. BIGFOOT CITY stalked just off of the pace while two wide, was in tight along the turn, drifted out nearing the quarter-marker and
bumped PRINCE DE PRINCE, rallied off of the turn but was outfinished in the late stages. OUR EXPECTATION was pinched at the start and chased from
the rear to the turn while saving ground, improved position leaving the turn and was outclosed in the stretch. WHOA BUDDY tracked the pace outside of
rivals to the turn, was carried out by PRINCE DE PRINCE leaving the quarter-marker and was outfinished in the stretch run. PRINCE DE PRINCE was
away alertly and was sent in the early going, ceded the lead to STONE GROOVE into the turn, stalked the pace while three wide along the bend, was
bumped by BIGFOOT CITY leaving the quarter-marker and in turn carried out WHOA BUDDY at that point and tired in the late stages.

PSYCHO DAR tracked the pace from a two wide path along the turn, gained ground leaving the bend to confront the pacesetter and kicked clear in the end.
SQUARE DEAL chased the early pace into the turn, improved position while two wide along the bend and was outkicked in the late stages while besting the
rest. HONEYMOONZ OVER was away alertly and set fast contested fractions through the turn, could not hold off the bid of PSYCHO DAR leaving the turn
and weakened in the drive, but was well clear of the rest for the show. EXHORTATION was a bit slow in the early stages, was two wide on the second turn
while improving position and lacked a late rally in the drive. EXCEED SPEED LIMIT pressed the quick pace from an inside path and was empty in the
stretch run. RUNKERRY chased the early pace, lost ground while four wide outside of foes on the turn and gave way in the late going. EXCLUSIVE
SPEAKER showed good early speed while tracking the pace to the turn, lost position while three wide on the turn and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
SHEZARUNAWAY pressed the pace to the turn, was asked for run nearing the quarter-marker and kicked clear in the end. LIVIN' AT THE BU tracked the
pace from a three wide path and was outfinished in the stretch run while clear of the rest. ZAFFERANA stalked the pace outside of rivals to the turn and was
outkicked in the drive but kept on to win the nod for third. ROSARITA CARMELITA saved ground while chasing the pace through the turn, weakened in the
late going and just missed for third. CLEVER CHIEFTESS bobbled at the start and was away a bit slowly, chased the pace from the rear to the turn, was in
tight quarters while lacking room nearing the quarter-marker and gave way in the stretch. PERFECTLY JULIE was away alertly and set the pace through the
turn, was pressured by the winner through the turn, could not hold off the bid by SHEZARUNAWAY nearing the quarter-marker and faded in the stretch.
