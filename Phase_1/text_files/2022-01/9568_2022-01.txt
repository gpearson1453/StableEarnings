Footnotes
FLASHY KING GEORGE was allowed to settle early and saved ground, angled out three wide in the stretch, closed determinedly and was up in the final
stride. EXPRIMIR dueled on the lead throughout, held grudgingly in the stretch drive while between horses and just missed. MONSTER HUNTER dueled on
the lead from the rail and held well in the stretch battle in a good effort. IT'S A MANS WORLD raced close up for three quarters, then faltered in the stretch.
KONTAR raced wide early and was no menace. NAMBITI never far back early, had no rally. RUN FOR CASH saved ground and was outrun. Due to a timer
malfunction the seven eight time was unavaible

good position early rallied three wide at the quarter pole an drew close, held grudgingly in the stretch. NATURAL BLING raced mid pack early, rallied in the
stretch three wide and closed strongly. HEIDI'S BACK never far back early, lacked a late response. CHARDON was no threat. ADVENTURE LAND had
