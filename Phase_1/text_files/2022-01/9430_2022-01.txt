Footnotes
STARS OF BLUEGRASS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a quarter to run and held
sway to the wire. PAIGE RUNNER was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the second turn, bumped with AVISSE into the stretch and
rallied when straightened away. COPPER CHARM lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn, reached a contending position but failed to
gain late. AVISSE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, bumped with PAIGE RUNNER nearing the three-sixteenths pole
and finished with a belated bid when clear. CHEROKEE PAPOOSE was forwardly placed from the inside throughout and gradually gave way. TIZ
WONDERFULLY dueled for the lead with YOU NEVER CALL from the inside and weakened after going six furlongs. YOU NEVER CALL disputed the pace
with TIZ WONDERFULLY while racing three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters.

Footnotes
TIZ MANNY broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear lead nearing the five-sixteenths pole, widened that advantage into the
lane and was ridden out to extend that margin. ROYAL SEEKER lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the
drive but finished well to gain the place. WILD WILD KINGDOM was away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner from the inside, gave way to
that rival after the opening quarter but stayed on well in the drive. PURELY POLITICAL was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and
gradually gave way. BRETT raced off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly. RED CHARGER showed no early speed,
raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MOONLIGHT BLUE raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened in
the drive. INTIMIDATING showed brief speed and weakened. AL RHYTHM was void of early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not menace.

Footnotes
HURRICAIN HUNTER sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and held sway to the wire. LADY
LANA chased the winner while racing three-wide throughout, could not gain on that rival in the drive but finished well to hold the place. MS SALLY showed
no early speed, saved ground through the second turn and finished with a steady bid. RED VENUS was forwardly placed from the inside, angled out into the
stretch and gave way in the drive. WIND TARTARE (FR) was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.
MICHELLE WHO chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. BRIGHTSIDEOFLIFE was void of early speed, raced
five-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
MARQUE IT UP was away in good order to stalk the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter and drew off with
complete authority. TIME TO ZOOM settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a
steady bid. THE KOHEN raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished
willingly. SAND WALKER raced off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled out nearing the quarter and finished evenly late. PLANET
NINE chased the leaders from off the rail and gave way in the drive. THIRTYMINUTEMASS was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and
did not threaten. JUGGLES lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. ACTIVE PASS was void of early speed, raced off the rail
through the turn and was not a factor. MI MALDITO AMOR was off slow, showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.
PAPA'S HONEY was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. CLEVER EMMA disputed the pace from the inside for a half
and weakened. MINEHUNTER dueled for the lead while racing three-wide and weakened after a half.

Footnotes
MO BOB (IRE) sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off through the lane.
THETRAILERGUY broke sharply to chase the winner while racing three-wide, angled inward nearing the sixteenth pole and failed to gain on that rival late.
SURPRSINGLYPERFECT was forwardly placed from the inside throughout and lacked the needed closing response. WE'RE JUST SAYIN settled off the
leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly. BOB'S ALL IN raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and
failed to rally. ANGELINO lacked early foot, moved four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. PERFECT COME BACK lacked early foot,
saved ground through the second turn and did not threaten. REAL LUTE raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and
weakened. TEDDY TIME showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. MATSON lacked early speed, saved
ground through the second turn and did not reach contention.
