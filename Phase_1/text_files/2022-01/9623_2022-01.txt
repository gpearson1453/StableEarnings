Footnotes
SAVVY GAL stalked the pace from inside then angled off the rail and went between past the half-mile pole, was caught in traffic on the turn, losing some
ground, tipped three wide leaving the bend, closed fast in the final furlong and inhaled the runner-up to win clear. LOTSA PEPPER sped clear and crossed
over to the inside, led through the turn and into the stretch, remained unchallenged into the furlong grounds but yielded to the winner in the final sixteenth.
ON PURPOSE got bumped and crowded between foes at the start, tracked two wide then moved to the rail on the turn, angled out in the stretch and
summoned a mild late bid and finished well to earn the show. STORMING LADY tracked the pace on the inside, tipped two wide into the stretch, chased
within range through the drive but needed to find more late. SWIRLING was forwardly placed outside rivals, took aim two wide leaving the bend and could
not offer a bid in the furlong grounds. RESPECTFULLY stalked between foes, steadied at the three-eighths pole, came three wide into the stretch and
lacked a rally. A NEW PEACE tracked in mid-pack off the rail, navigated the turn three then four wide and offered no response when called upon. ANA LISA
bumped inner rival leaving the gate, raced up close early, was a bit rank early on the turn then again past the quarter pole and weakened through the lane.
MISS CAROUSEL stumbled at the start, went three wide into the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and made no impact. VEGAS PALM trailed along the
inside into the turn, tipped out off the rail and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FORBIDDEN KINGDOM sped clear from inside, set all the pace a bit off the rail through the turn and into the stretch, put to right-handed urging in the drive
and remained clear to the wire. PINEHURST stalked the lone leader up the backstretch, raced along the inside then tipped two wide with a quarter mile left
to run, could not find the needed late kick in the furlong grounds but stayed on to secure second. MCLAREN VALE stalked off the rail, took the turn two then
three wide, was bothered a bit in upper stretch and kept on in the final sixteenth. DOPPELGANGER settled early, went up outside a pair of rivals at the
seven-sixteenths pole, chased three deep around the turn, came four wide into the stretch and needed to find more in the late stages. WHAT IN BLAZES
broke alertly from outside, dropped back off the pace, went four wide into the turn, angled to the rail around the bend and tired.

SHE'S GOT A WAY tracked off the rail, went up three deep, vied three wide on the turn, cleared into the stretch and held gamely. RUBY RAY showed early
speed then had to steady at the nine-sixteenths pole, chased the pacesetter on the inside, bid inside the winner in upper stretch and lacked the late punch
to get by. CUBAN CRISIS (GB) broke a bit slow and inward, checked off heels early then again near the seven-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into the
stretch, tipped out late and finished a game third. GRANOLA GIRL raced off the pace outside a rival, went two wide into the turn, angled out and came five
wide into the stretch, closed well and rounded out the superfecta. JERUSALEMA (IRE) dropped back early and angled to the inside, hugged the rail through
the turn and improved placings in the lane. BANJO QUEEN raced off the pace early on then moved within range of the leader up the backstretch, went three
deep into the turn, four wide into the stretch and could not rally. MIDNIGHT SILENCE was off slow to begin, stumbled crossing surfaces early and had to
steady, trailed a bit off the rail into the stretch and was not a factor. WORK TO LIVE sped to the front, cleared and angled over, vied inside on the turn,
drifted a bit late on the bend, lost contact with the winner entering the stretch and gave way. DARLING DONNA showed speed then ceded the lead early,
bid between foes and got put in tight quarters nearing the quarter pole, then faded down the lane.

Footnotes
CANOODLING cleared and crossed over to the inside, set the pace to the far turn, was tested by BURGOO ALLEY (IRE) on the second bend, maintained a
short lead then cleared again into the stretch, led into the final sixteenth and held gamely. WARREN'S SHOWTIME rated along the inside in the early going,
saved ground into the stretch, looked to make a run but lacked room behind CANOODLING from upper stretch to the sixteenth pole, finally gained a clear
path and finished well for the place. AVENUE DE FRANCE (FR) steadied off heels into the first turn, was unhurried along the inside at the back, saved
ground to the stretch, moved out in the lane, rallied four wide and missed the place. BODHICITTA (GB) stalked in the two path, took closer order three wide
into the far turn, entered the lane three to four wide, bid in the stretch but got outkicked in the final sixteenth. MADONE reserved in the early going on the
inside, moved off the rail on the backstretch, pulled at the seven-sixteenths pole and angled to the two path, was coaxed two wide around the far turn but
failed to launch a serious bid. BURGOO ALLEY (IRE) bobbled a bit at the start, pulled early outside the leader, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, bid
two wide around the far turn, lost contact into the stretch. SLOANE GARDEN (GB) was taken back shortly after the start and steered down to the two path,
advanced four wide into the second bend, entered the lane four to five wide and weakened.

Footnotes
ESSENTIAL WAGER vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals then inched ahead to take control, held a short lead over TEAM MERCHANTS through the turn,
put that rival away in upper stretch, met the challenge from SHOOTERS SHOOT in the final sixteenth and held gamely. SHOOTERS SHOOT vied between
rivals early then got crowded near the nine-sixteenths pole, chased the top pair three wide into and around the turn, came back in the final furlong, drew
alongside ESSENTIAL WAGER with a sixteenth remaining but could not get by. CEZANNE dropped back off the pace early, moved to the inside, exited the
bend two wide and produced a mild rally to gain the show. TEAM MERCHANTS broke awkwardly but recovered quickly, went up to vie three deep for the
lead then pressed the pace from outside past the half-mile pole, continued outside the leader in the two path around the bend, could not kick on with the
winner in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. DARK VADER was off slow and broke inward, steered out well off the rail, took the turn four
then three wide and weakened.

Footnotes
PAMMY'S READY cleared early and was guided to the rail, controlled the pace through the early stages, saved ground into the lane, inched away in upper
stretch, then was challenged by a pair of rivals in the late stages and lasted. DUVET DAY (IRE) tossed her head and came away slow, traveled between
foes on the first turn, raced outside a rival up the backstretch, swung four wide into the lane, closed well in the final furlong, drew alongside the top pair in
the final sixteenth but was too late. ANNIE'S SONG (IRE) stalked the leader outside a rival, tipped three wide at the five-sixteenths pole, rallied outside the
leader in the final sixteenth but was not enough. LET FREEDOM REIN stalked three wide around the first turn, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch,
coaxed two wide on the second bend, chased within striking distance through the lane but finished evenly late while losing placings. GIMME MO BABY
settled along the inside, exited the far turn two wide, split foes with a furlong remaining but lacked then needed late kick. EXIT SOUL tucked inside prior to
the first turn, saved ground from off the pace to the stretch, started to make a run but lacked room and was forced to check hard in upper stretch, was
guided off the rail after and was ridden out. VULIN stalked the pace from inside, saved ground into the lane and weakened along the fence. MISSING
PENNY went three deep around the first turn, chased outside a rival off the pace, entered the far turn two wide, moved out and came four wide into the
stretch and had little left for the drive. SQUILLIONS hesitated and the start and came away very slow, trailed throughout and never got involved.
