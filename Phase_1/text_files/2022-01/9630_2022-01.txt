Footnotes
MONSTRODAMOUS lunged at the start and was away a step slowly, improved position along the first turn, was under a tight hold into the backstretch run,
mounted a three wide bid leaving the second turn to confront the leading pair and dug in while on the left lead in the final strides to prevail. DARCEE'S LOVI
DOVI was fanned five wide into the first turn, stalked the pace to the second turn, closed on AMITY HARBOR into the drive, had a slim lead into the final
sixteenth but was outfinished in the late stages by the winner while holding for second. AMITY HARBOR lugged out into DARCEE'S LOVI DOVI into the first
turn, set the fractions to the quarter-marker, yielded the lead at that spot but kept on in the stretch to save third. FOUR O'FIVE stalked the pace while just off
of the rail, was three wide on the far turn and closed with late interest but could not reel in the top three. COLLUSION DELUSION settled off of the pace
through the first half-mile, was steered to the four path on the second turn, mounted a rally in upper stretch but was outkicked in the late going. BROKEN
FINGER was unhurried while saving ground to the second turn, gained ground into the stretch but lacked the needed late response.

SATANTA was content to settle through the early stages, was in tight quarters midway through the turn while two wide, gained ground into the stretch and
under firm handling made a late surge to prevail. STORMINSIDE was away alertly and showed good early speed while dueling on the front end, vied for the
lead inside of the sixteenth marker but could not hold off the oncoming winner while holding for second. FOSTER BOI dueled for pace duties from a two
wide position on the turn, vied for the lead inside of the final sixteenth but was outfinished nearing the wire. CANNONBALL COMIN tracked the pace from a
three wide path on the turn and was outkicked in the stretch run. MINOSO saved ground while stalking the pace from the inside and weakened in the drive.

BIG PAPA STEVE tracked the pace to the turn, improved position while two wide into the stretch, was given his cue at the furlong ground, responded well
and drew clear in the end. UNTO THEE was away alertly, was sent to set quick fractions while being prompted on the turn, edged clear into the lane but
was tiring in deep stretch, was caught inside of the final sixteenth but held for second. MEETMEATTHECLUB took back in the early stages to stalk the pace,
slipped to the inside for the drive, improved position in upper stretch but was outkicked in the late stages. STANFORD GRAD tracked the pace to the turn,
gained ground on the pacesetter along the turn, swung widest for the drive and weakened in the late going. MILEYS BLUECAT chased the early pace to the
turn, lost ground while two wide on the bend and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SEAHAWK CODY saved ground while stalking the pace to the backstretch run, mounted a three wide on the second turn to improve position, collared
SHORT RIB nearing the furlong grounds and pulled away in the end. SHORT RIB was away in good order and set the fractions to the second turn while
under pressure, was collared by SEAHAWK CODY nearing the furlong grounds and was not a match for the winner in the stretch but kept on to secure
second. MAYBE SOMETIME was content to settle to the half-mile marker, improved position while two wide on the second turn, checked off of heels
entering the stretch and weakened in the late stages, but held for third. CAPE POINT stalked the early pace, gained ground from a five wide path on the
second turn, gave way in the drive and just missed for third. RICH WARRIOR prompted the pace from a three wide path, challenged SHORT RIB nearing
the quarter-marker, lost ground into the stretch and faded in the late going. SLEEP OVER broke awkwardly and was away slowly, recovered to stalk the
pace outside of rivals to the half-mile, was outrun on the second turn, was eased in upper stretch and walked off under his own power.

GEE GEE WHIZ settled off of the pace while saving ground, angled out leaving the furlong marker, headed DESERT DUDE in the final sixteenth, dueled
with the runner-up and gamely dug in in the final strides to prevail. DESERT DUDE prompted the pace from a two wide path to the second turn, made a
three wide bid into the stretch run, took command into the final furlong, was confronted by GEE GEE WHIZ nearing the sixteenth-marker, dueled and was
gamely bested in the end, while clear of the rest. COOLCROSS was a bit wide on the first turn, tracked the pace outside of foes to the second turn, slipped
to the two path along the far turn, swung widest into the drive, improved position in upper stretch but was outkicked in the late going. MAHI MAHI was away
alertly and was hustled to set the pace while being prompted, came under pressure approaching the quarter-marker, ceded the lead nearing the furlong
grounds and gave way in the drive. ROCKY TOUGH was content to settle through the early stages, saved ground to the second turn while trailing and did
not offer a late rally in the stretch.

Footnotes
AUSTRIAN NAVY was bumped at the start by SWEET KAELA, took command of the early pace and set the fractions to the turn, was kept to task through
the lane and held safely in the end over the oncoming runner-up. GET'EM TIGER tracked the pace outside of foes, was roused while four wide approaching
the quarter-marker, found her best stride in the final sixteenth and while unable to reel in the winner kept on to secure second. SHOUT IT OUT was away
alertly and pressed the pace to the turn from a three wide path, chased AUSTRIAN NAVY to the furlong grounds and was outkicked in the late going, while
holding for third. LIAM'S SECRET was allowed to settle through the first three furlongs, was three wide outside of foes while trailing on the turn, improved
position into the stretch and continued that run in the late going after the rider lost the crop at the sixteenth-marker. HALF HOPING was a bit slow getting
into stride leaving the break, chased the pace to the turn from the rear, was two wide on the turn and did not mount a late rally. SWEET KAELA broke out at
the start and bumped AUSTRIAN NAVY at the break, chased the pace to the turn from the inside and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
LOVER BOY TOM was content to settle in the early stages while saving ground, rallied off of the bend into the stretch, vied between foes inside of the
sixteenth-marker and dug in in the final strides to prevail. THECHIEFHASTRICKS tracked the pace from a two wide path, closed in the drive to take
command into the final sixteenth and was nipped on the wire for the win while holding safely for second. DANNY'S IRISH BOY chased the pace outside of
rivals, swung widest into the lane, rallied well in the stretch and came within aim of the lead but could not close the gap while getting up in time to claim the
show. FULL OF LIFE stalked the early pace while three wide and made a mild late gain in the stretch run. ROISTER was sent to dispute the pace through
the turn, took command nearing the furlong marker and was outfinished in the late stages. HAKUNUI was away alertly and was hustled to set contested
fractions through the turn, came under pressure leaving the turn and tired in the drive. QUEEN'S MARQUE chased the pace from a two wide path and was
not a factor. WIND IN HIS SAIL ducked in at the start, lost the rider and walked off under his own power. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
INTO THE START INVOLVING WIND IN HIS SAIL AND DETERMINED THAT THE RUNNER CAUSED HIS OWN ISSUES AT THE BREAK, DUCKED IN
AND LOST THE RIDER AND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF FINISH STEMMING FROM THE INCIDENT.
