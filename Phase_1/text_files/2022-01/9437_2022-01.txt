Footnotes
SASSY LAD vied for the early lead between horses, then was rated back off the duel, eased out nearing the quarter pole and came four wide while making
a bid, then drew away in the furlong grounds to prove much the best, driving. BE THE BOSS stumbled at the start, then dueled for the lead on the inside,
then kept on to the wire staying on for the place gamely. BLO MY BUDGET chased the pace and was three to four wide on the turn but had no kick in the
drive. DOWNTOWNCHALYBROWN dueled for the lead and made a three wide bid on the turn to gain a short advantage nearing the quarter pole, then
weakened the final furlong. AWESOME WOLF failed to menace.

ORIGINALY FROM DOT was well placed early on the inside, awaited room, made a inside move leaving the turn, went on even terms for command by the
furlong marker. KIT KAT KATIE was away alertly to set the early pace while in the two path, then was headed on the turn, shook clear leaving the turn but
then was headed by the winner by the furlong marker and proved to be no match for that rival while saving the place. SHE'SMYRISENSTAR was allowed to
settle early on the inside, then steadied slightly by the quarter pole, then had a mild late rally to just miss the place award, bested rest. DISCREETLY
TOUGH chased the early pace three wide, came four wide into the drive and weakened. BRYNBELLA chased the pace and was between rivals on the turn
and weakened. RUSSIAN MELODY pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command but came up empty in the drive,
pulled up bad and was vanned off.

turn and dueled for command by the quarter pole, then led in deep stretch and was denied late to just miss. SCARLET LILY vied for the early lead three
wide and in between rivals, then dueled for command and moved to the inside on the turn, then was still battling for command by the furlong marker and

BETTER YET stalked the early pace three wide, then shifted to the inside on the turn, made a inside bid leaving the turn, and got up latye to edge clear
under a drive. LIL MISS HOTSHOT tracked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid by the quarter pole, then continued that bid but was outfinished.
COLOR FORCE set the pace in the two path, was well handled on the lead and was headed leaving the furlong marker and gave way grudgingly. NOTE TO
SELFIE was bumped at the start, chased the early pace, came four wide into the drive while making a bid but lacked the needed closing bid late.
ROYALBONNIELEGACY was rated along the inside, then angled out leaving the turn for racing room and offered a belated rally. CARMELTINI was dwelt at
the start, then was far back early and failed to menace. IL MIO AMORE was reluctant to load, then settled early and tired.

CUTEFACECHUBYWAIST set a pressured pace early while racing in the three path, shook clear on the turn, then drew out by the furlong marker and
maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove best under a drive. FIRST FOREVER was rated along early three wide, made a four wide bid by the quarter
pole, then was gaining late but could not get to the winner, second best. LITTLEBITALILY pressed the winner early from the inside, then stalked that rival on
the turn, but lacked the needed stretch bid while besting the rest. SNIFF tracked the early pace and made a mild bid between horses by the quarter pole and
flattened out. PROMISE OF JOY chased the early pace on the inside and weakened. GROTON ST SCOUT trailed.

NAUGHTY PRINCE stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole, then wore down the pace setter and held off HIS NAME IS SUE
late to prevail under a drive. HIS NAME IS SUE tracked the early pace five wide, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole, then was gaining late. HEY
CONGRATS set the pace and was headed nearing the sixteenths pole and faded late. KITTEN'S SOLUTION was settled along on the inside early, then
tipped out two wide leaving the turn and had a belated rally in traffic late. READY AND RICH was allowed to settle early, advanced three wide by the five
sixteenths pole, then moved down to the inside by the quarter pole, continued that bid into the stretch but lacked room in deep stretch, losing all chance.
TORAZO passed the tiring rivals. WAHOOWA WAHOOWA was reserved early on the inside, swung out five wide for the drive but had no rally.
VENOMOUS STATE stalked the pace four wide and weakened. PEANUTS PERFECTION chased the pace three wide and weakened.

NICE WEATHER was away alertly to set the early pace while clear, then was put to left handed crop urging in the stretch and responded well to prove best.
THINKIN OUT LOUD chased the early pace on the inside, tipped out three wide leaving the turn for aim on the front runner, but could not gain on that rival
while finishing willingly to be clearly second best. CHAIN REACTION was reserved early, advanced on the inside on the turn, eased out by the quarter pole
and swung out five wide leaving the turn and had a late rally, bested rest. GANDI was bumped at the start, tracked the pace three wide and weakened.
ADY'S MUNNY chased the pace five wide and weakened. LTL BEAR SALOON chased the pace three wide and weakened. ORASHI was settled and was
three to four wide on the turn and had no rally. NAZARENO showed no speed and trailed.

Footnotes
VITESSE stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command, then gained a short advantage leaving the turn, but was challenged
by ASK NEAL by the furlong marker, dug in gamely in the furlong grounds and edged clear late to prove best under a drive. ASK NEAL was allowed to
settle early, made a five wide move nearing the quarter pole, then continued that move to challenge for command by the furlong marker but hung. BIFF was
between rivals into the first turn, chased the pace two to three wide, angled in leaving the far turn, but came up empty in the drive on the inside. VISHNU
was away alertly to set the pace and moved down to the inside and weakened in the drive. OSCAR WINNER stalked the early pace and made a four wide
move on the turn to loom boldly but weakened. MASTERFUL TOUCH was well placed on the inside and weakened. TEMPTING THE TIGER was void of
speed and was not a factor. WHERE'S THE BEN'S failed to menace.

Footnotes
PAGE DOWN dueled for the early lead and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, drew clear leaving the turn and drew off in the final furlong to
prove much the best, driving. AMERICANO chased the early pace and was five wide on the turn, then rallied well for the place award. FUEL THE BERN
tracked the early pace on the inside, eased off the rail by the quarter pole, swung out four wide for the drive and had no kick. CUMBERLAND GAP dueled
for the lead on the inside and weakened in the drive. LETORT was allowed to settle early, then had some run in the lane, but was in traffic and then angled
in for racing room by the sixteenths pole and had a belated rally. RANDOM THOUGHTS was reserved early, then was three wide by the quarter pole,
shifted out in the stretch, then was in traffic in the furlong grounds and passed the tiring rivals. DISCO'S BRIDGE tracked the pace four wide and weakened.
EXECUTIVE DECREE lacked a rally. PETTINBERG chased the pace in between rivals and weakened. STONE SCULPTOR tracked the early pace three
wide and weakened. The rider on RANDOM THOUGHTS claimed foul against the rider on FUEL THE BERN for alleged interference in the furlong grounds,
after the Stewards reviewed the replays there was no change.
