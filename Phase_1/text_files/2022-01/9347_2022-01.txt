Footnotes
OLIVIAN away in good order, pressed the issue up the backstretch in the three path, dropped to the inside early in the bend with clear, increased that
advantage into the lane, maintained a daylight advantage to the wire under steady handling. SIP broke out bothering SWEETNESS TO, was straightened
and raced behind the leaders three wide, set down for the drive, finished willingly to be edging clear for the place and slowly getting to the winner. MISS
RITA lacked speed early, moved a bit closer in some traffic late in the turn, waited briefly, clear, lugged out late while still getting up for the show spot. RUN
FEARLESS with the early pace in the two path and between rivals, fell back off the winner through the turn, weakened in the drive. HALF SCOUT with the
early pace inside, also chased the winner through the turn, gave way in the drive while remaining along the rail. FLIRTATIOUS SMILE made little impact
while racing off the inside. COURTNEY FAY in the second flight outside, raced four wide through the turn and came up empty for the stretch ru.
SWEETNESS TO bothered at the start, raced three out to four wide midway on the turn while under pressure, tired in the drive. LORI'S EYES trailed inside
throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
SOUIXPER CHARGER came in just after the start, was straightened to race within striking distance outside, three out to four wide turn, challenged on the
outside when straightened for home, drove clear then held the runner up safe late. MRS. BEANS back off the pace while racing inside, moved closer while
continuing to save some ground turning for home, moved out for some room and finished willingly to be clear for the second spot. BEBOP SHOES forwardly
placed early off the inside, came three wide into the lane, challenged inside the winner and between foes nearing midstretch, flattened out in the final
sixteenth. FIVE O ONE midpack while racing outside, raced five wide through the turn, widest in the drive, improved position down the middle of the strip.
JAMES'S MOONSHINE lacked speed, saved ground through the turn, came off the rail for the drive then improved a bit through traffic.. MACHO ROCCO
pressed the issue early off the inside, briefly put a head in front midway on the turn, could not last. DESTINEDTOBEASTAR broke back, trailed for over six
furlongs, moved out for the drive, improved position with some belated interest. CHICKEN HAWK broke sharp, helped set the pace for three furlongs then
gave way in the drive. DARK NINJA bothered at the start, raced back, three to four wide turn, picked off a couple of tiring foes midtrack while never a threat.
WHENTHEDOVESCRY off the pace well out in the strip, four wide turn, tired in the drive. AGAVE KID was never a factor. HERITAGE PARK broke in, raced
in the second flight early, backed up drive.

Footnotes
MOTION PICTURE forwardly placed into the first turn inside,moved out late in that bend, tracked middle half, three wide into the lane, bid, took over, drove
well clear. UNCLE MO'S CAT pressed the issue into the first turn three wide took over to be clear onto the backstretch, set the pace two path, proved no
match for the winner in the drive, remained clear for the place. KNIEVEL four wide through the first turn, continued outside in the second flight up the
backstretch, four wide into the far turn, three wide into the lane, finished up best of the rest. PISSARRO'S MANDATE broke on top, prompted the issue off
the inside, remained in the two path second turn, went evenly for the drive. LOVING LUCKY void of speed, remained back far turn, steadied slightly behind
a checking ROUSING SIREN, recovered and swung out five wide for the drive, improved position down the center of the strip. BIG PETE void of speed,
asked along threat three wide in some traffic turning for home, improved a bit while never dangerous. REMEMBER NORMANDY lacked speed, four wide
first turn, four wide again through most of the second turn, lacked a significant closing response. FALCON HEAVY broke back, dropped inside in the second
turn, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. SPA in mid pack early, shuffled back onto the backstretch, moved out to be four wide, tired in the
drive. UNEMBELLISHED jostled back in some traffic soon after the start, dropped inside first turn, moved closer while continuing along the inside into the far
turn, failed to sustain that advance in the drive in tiring. SPEND AGAIN settled off the pace while just off the inside, three to four wide turning for home, gave
way. ROUSING SIREN in mid pack early, checked up in traffic far turn, fell back, trailed home.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD'S BEAUTY narrowly set the pace off the inside, angled in a bit when clear early turn, two path into the lane, held off the runner up in a
determined effort while under firm handling. PERFECT HAPPINESS off the early pace, saved ground through the turn when moving a bit closer, shifted
outside the winner for the drive, could not get to that one in the run to the wire, fully extended to hold the place. CANDURA last to leave, trailed early, angled
out to be five wide turning for home, set down for the drive, getting to the runner up late while widest through the lane. JETS A GINNIN back off the pace
and the inside, four wide through the turn, lacked a closing response. JOY'S ROCKET within striking distance, came up empty for the drive. HEADLAND
pressed the issue early just off the inside, gave way in the turn.

Footnotes
PRESS SNOOZE rail, checked up late turn, moved out, bid, took over inside the leader past the furlong marker then held runner up safe late. MAJOR
ATTRACTION in mid pack early outside, steady gain three wide the middle part, drifted out when mounting a mild bid on the winner just inside the furlong
grounds, could not get to that one late, remained clear for the place. POP'S BISCUIT away in good order, prompted the pace off the inside, three wide into
the turn, took over entering the stretch, could not last. CAN IMAGINE in the second flight off the inside, in some traffic into and through much of the turn,
came up empty when clear for the drive to finish up early. OPUS EQUUS off a step slow, raced well wide early, four wide through the turn, hit a seam when
steered five wide into the lane, improved position while too late. GEORGIA DEPUTY off a step slow, raced well back while saving ground, improved inside
of considerable traffic turning for home, lacked a further advance. JUSTIN'S QUEST off a step slow, raced back off the rail, three wide into the lane, made
little impact in finishing up evenly. TOOBADSOSAD lacked speed, came four wide out of the turn, also lacked a closing punch. ESCAPE FUND broke sharp,
cleared soon after, set the pace closest to the inside, faltered when headed for the drive. KAT'S HITMAN off the pace well wide, five to six path turn, faded
through the lane. TORIN forwardly placed early, tired while five wide turning for home.

Footnotes
ONE FOR RICHIE forwardly placed outside, pressed four wide into the turn, ranged up and took over by late in the bend, shook clear when straightened for
home, maintained a comfortable advantage through the stretch while being kept to task. AMERICAIN JOEY off a step slow, trailed early, raced in the two
path through the turn, improved inside of traffic and finished up willingly to be clear of the others, no real threat to the winner. BACHELOR PAD off a step
slow, also raced well back early, came three wide out of the turn, proved no threat to the top pair, best of the rest. BEVERLY PARK with the pace between
foes, weakened in the drive. MR. ANKENY pressed the issue for a half three wide and between horses, gradually faltered in the drive. PULL MY CHAIN fell
back after breaking with the leaders, roused in the two path turning for home, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing response. JACK VAN BERG broke
sharp, set or forced the pace closest to the inside, stopped before midway on the bend.

Footnotes
SKY AND SAND bothered slightly soon after the start, closer into the turn, three wide bid in the turn, shook clear, drew off, ridden out. FRISCO LINE in mid
pack early well out in the strip, four wide advance through the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, proved determined late to earn the place.
ISLAND MUSIC steadied just after the start when COASTAL CHAOS lugged out, raced back, four wide through the turn, rallied on the outside for the place,
willingly. MINICONJOU bothered slightly just after the start, mid pack toward the inside, three wide into the lane, staged a mild rally to improve slightly.
UNSTABLE PRINCE well off the pace, three to four wide through the turn, also improved position with some mild late interesdt. BOAT SONG moved up the
inside to set the pace, briefly clear into the turn, faltered when confronted late in the bend. COLE SPUR away in good order, prompted the issue from the
outside up the backstretch, challenged between rivals midway on the turn, faded through the stretch. SINNER'S SIN in the second flight toward the inside,
had little for the stretch run. COASTAL CHAOS broke alertly, lugged out soon after to fall back and trail, not a factor after swinging out wide for the drive.
ALOGON moved inside when off the pace in the turn, steady fade through the lane.

Footnotes
WHISKEY DOUBLE outrun early well wide, came five then six wide into the lane, rallied, closed with good resolve to be up at the wire. FULL AUTHORITY
moved up to set the pace along the inside, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home, clear late, nipped in the late going. JOE FRAZIER
outrun early, moved closer five then down to four wide to be in a challenging position turning for home, hung in the drive. CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK lacked
speed, raced four wide through the turn, widest in the drive, staged a mild rally to improve late, not enough for the show. UPSTRIKER forwardly placed early
just off the inside, three wide into the stretch, had little left the furlong. MO'S MOJO last away, trailed early, swung out to be six wide turning for home,
picked off some tiring rivals while not a serious threat. MOLTO VIVACE within striking distance in mid pack inside, saved ground into the lane and then was
finished the final furlong. SPEITFUL SAM forwardly placed outside, raced four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, tired through the lane. VULCAN was
never a serious threat. SILVER MOON ROAD prompted the pace while racing outside. FULL IMPACT forwardly placed early while three wide, stopped in
the turn, jogged in late to finish far back.

Footnotes
FAN CLUB allowed the early leader to go off the inside, remained patient in the run up the backstretch, collared the pacesetter turning for home, quickly
clear, ridden out. HELLMAN bothered at the start, raced well back for five furlongs, rallied five wide turning for home, finished well to annex the place, no
threat to the wnner. CENTURION one paced three wide, lacked a closing response to finish up best of the rest. TEN GAUGE lacked speed, moved off the
inside, three to four wide turning into the stretch, also finished up evenly in lacking a closing punch. GOOD LUCK CHARM broke back, lacked speed,
improved position with some modest late interest, not a real threat. CONSTITUTIONAL LAW broke out, moved up to take control into the first turn, well clear
onto the backstretch after a rapid opening quarter despite snug restraint, continued to hold a large advantage, into the far turn, offered little resistance to the
winner turning for home, backed up readily down the lane. GRACE'S SECRET in the second flight, was finished after four furlongs. CHISHOLM TRAIL
failed to menace while racing three wide. SERBIAN SAILOR five wide into the first turn, in mid pack, tired in the drive. OR'EFFICE chased early, stopped
after a half, distanced, walked in.
