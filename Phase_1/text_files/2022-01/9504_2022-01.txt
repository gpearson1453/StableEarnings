Footnotes
PLATINUM GREEK exchanged a light bump at the start then angled in early, tracked inside on or just off the rail, took the lead in upper stretch, drifted out a
bit but held. ICY CAPE exchanged a light brush in the early going, settled in to stalk mid-pack, went five to six wide on the turn, was gaining but too late.
LONG RANGER stalked mid-division in behind the leaders, went three wide on the turn, angled inside foes coming out of that bend and finished strongly.
ZIVA DA'VID exchanged a light bump at the start, stalked from off the inside, went four wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. MARIA'S TOWER
settled well back early, saved ground on the turn, ran on mildly. FLAMING BESITOS broke a bit awkwardly then veered far out in the early going, moved in
from five to two wide early on the turn, raced between rivals on that bend, angled out at the head of the stretch and ran on. DESERT BEAUTY dueled inside
a rival but racing three wide, gave way. CATHRYN VALENTINA dueled outside a rival four wide, faltered and faded. SPANKEY THUNDER exchanged a
brush early and was in slightly tight quarters, moved in from five to three wide on the turn, failed to menace. TRAVELIN LADY raced off the inside going four
wide on the turn and was not a factor. D ORO CANYON broke outwardly, pulled up in the early going, was vanned off.

Footnotes
HENNESSY'S SQUIRT stalked the pace, edged closer four to five wide on the turn, took over and was clear into upper- to mid-stretch and held sway while
being kept to the task. SECRET'S DOUBLE stalked the pacesetter, went three to four wide on the turn in striking distance, was no match for the winner but
secured the place. ALL CHROME settled mid-pack, moved in from four to three wide on the turn, gained mildly. QUANTUM BULL steadied slightly at the
start then angled in and was unhurried, steadily advanced three to four wide into and on the turn, came out further turning for home and gained late.
BONFIRE PARTY was forced in and bumped a rival at the start, set the pace in the clear racing well off the rail, went three then two wide on the turn,
weakened in the stretch. WATFORD saved ground into the turn then moved out midway on that bend to be four wide by the five-sixteenths, passed some
tired rivals. TIME TO RUMBLE was bumped and steadied at the start, went two deep on the turn and was not a threat. STORMIN TEXASON broke
inwardly, moved from three to two wide on the turn within striking distance of the leaders but came up empty. FLYING PHANTOM chased mid-pack from
outside going six wide on the turn, faded. POSTMANFOURTYEIGHT was not a factor going five wide on the turn.

Footnotes
NOWORRIESTODAY attended the pace from outside, went three to four wide on the turn taking the lead by the head of the lane, drove clear under steady
handling. FEISTY HALO stalked from mid-pack taking closer order four to five wide on the turn, was second best. MAX A MILLION RSS saved ground on or
just off the rail on the turn, came out at the top of the stretch and improved position. UNBRIDLED DIVA set the pace racing off the rail in the two to three
path, was challenged through the turn and weakened in the lane. CONNIE'S LINDA was in tight at the break, settled into stride, fanned seven wide into the
stretch and ran on mildly. THE PACESETTER was well-positioned mid-pack, tracked three wide through the turn but failed to threaten. MIDNIGHT
SPECIAL T angled six wide turning for home and was not a threat. SPEED SEAL was in tight quarters about the three-eighths between rivals, dropped back
and moved nearer the rail, failed to rally. MISS EASYGO chased briefly, dropped back three wide, faded. JEDI JENNIE was not a threat.
