Footnotes
MISS DIAL vied for the early lead, challenged on the front end throughout and drove clear late. DIAMOND INDY SKIES raced near the back in the
beginning, came around the turn on the outside, made a wide bid, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. UNDEFINABLE dueled for the
early lead, saved ground around the turn, couldn't match strides with the winner late and got caught for second at the wire. TURF DANCER pressed the
early pace, raced close throughout and lacked a finish. I SEE BLING void of early speed and was never a factor. MOLLI WAY hopped at the start, raced
near the back and showed little.

MISTER K vied for the early lead, dueled throughout and proved the best late. CHIEF CHEETAH raced within contention, had an outside trip, made a wide
bid and was just up for second. OXXON dueled on the front end, saved ground and was caught late for second. POSEIDON WRATH lacked early speed,
came around the final turn wide and was never close. BOBBY JR. broke opened gates before start, had an awkward start and was never a threat.

early lead, forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for the winner late. CLOCKED IN TYME lacked early speed, moved up, within contention and
finished evenly. STREAMER raced in the middle of the field, eased back, made a mild bid and was no factor. HANGING LAKE void of early speed,
improved position, but was no threat. MY REBEL GIRL pressed the early pace and faded. QUICK HEAT raced near the middle of the pack, finished wide
and was outrun. MISS DAWN challenged for the early lead, raced outside around the first turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
SI ES GOYA within contention, forwardly placed throughout, drove clear down the home stretch and won under steady urging. ARCHIE vied for the early
lead, took the advantage around the final turn, proved no match late for the winner, but was best of others. EASTSIDE BOY lacked early speed, had an
outside trip, gained ground and proved no match for the top two. MIDNIGHT REVOLT void of early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. FULL OF
RUN raced near the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. HONOR MY SPEED dueled on the front end in the early part and faded. INVASORS
WIND raced near the middle of the pack and weakened. TAKING NOTES always raced near the back and was outrun. SOUTHPINE GIFT pressed the early
pace and dropped back. WHISKEY'S GONE raced within striking distance and stopped.
