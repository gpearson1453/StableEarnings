Footnotes
DRIFTER within striking distance along the inside, continued to save ground turn, put in tight while still on the rail past the furlong marker by a drifting
BEEASY, continued with good determination while remaining inside to be up at the wire. POPSTER well off the early pace while off the inside, ranged up to
challenge four wide late in the turn, long drive while continuing widest of the first flight, outkicked in the late goilng. BEEASY broke on top, narrowly set the
pace toward the inside, continued to hold a narrow advantage into the lane, drifted in putting the winner in tight approaching the furlong grounds, weakened
from between the top two late. PRINCE DARE hesitated at the break to spot the field several lengths, continued back up the backstretch and into the turn,
angled out three wide turning for home, improved position while not a threat to the top three. WILD APPEAL moved up to press the issue three wide before
a quarter, weakened in the drive. DOX BIZ forced the pace outside the early leader, gave way in the two path late in the turn. PIONEER BOB was finished
early, trailed home. BOURBON DELIGHT awkward beginning, unseated rider.

Footnotes
LIVING FOR TODAY in mid pack early while off the inside, dropped toward the rail when being asked and advancing late ln the second bend, moved back
out, split foes, drew clear under pressure. MADAM PIE forwardly placed while saving ground for five furlongs, steered out and challenged outside the early
leader turning for home, took over and showed the way past the furlong marker, could not match the winner late, clearly second best. PURE SILK broke
well, pressed the pace in the three path, continued in good position through the final turn, raced flat through the stretch but managed to come back a bit for
the show spot late. MOONLIGHT BLAZE off slowly, trailed early after tucking toward the inside to save some ground first turn, continued well back in the run
up the backstretch, swung out five wide turning into the lane, finished willingly to miss the show. MISS ALPHA BELLA broke alertly, cleared toward the
inside into the first turn, set the pace until a quarter remained, began to weaken when headed. JERI DAWN saved ground when off the pace, continued
inside second turn, improved position slightly while not a serious threat. SMOKING BOSSA NOVA void of speed when five wide into the first turn, continued
back and off the inside, four wide midway on the final turn, angled in late in that bend then passed tiring rivals while not a threat. TIZ MY PLAN remained
back in failing to menace. GRACIE WILL SMILE well back and three wide first turn, continued outside, four wide through the second bend, failed to muster a
rally. CAGED BEAR off a step slow, moved up to race in mid pack in the three path, began to tire in the second turn. MY DADDY'S TRAINER was finished
early while racing four wide. COURAGEOUS CAPPEN gave way after a half, well beaten.

Footnotes
RICHNESS moved up to set the pace in the two path, continued to show the way by a slight margin through the turn, kicked steadily clear through the lane
while being kept to pressure. FASTEST SPIN also forwardly placed from the start, saved ground while closest to the winner through the turn, could not
match strides with that one through the lane, clearly second best. FLASHY BIZ last to leave, raced well back early, came four wide out of the turn, finished
well clear of the rest while not a threat to the top pair. VERY SPICY back off the pace well out in the strip, came five out to six wide for the drive, improved
position slightly while not a serious threat. UNHERDOF pressed the pace while racing three wide and weakened. WICKED STREET went one paced up the
backstretch in the three path, dropped in slightly behind the first flight late in the turn, continued evenly to the wire. PURRFECT LOVE was never dangerous
while racing in the two path. AND ISLES fell back after a quarter, trailed into the turn, three wide, passed some tiring rivals while never a threat. MISS ALLIE
GRACE void of speed, came five wide out of the turn, lacked a closing kick. FAST SOPHIA in the second flight early along the inside, began to fade before
a half. TOMS MAXIMILLIAN behind the early leaders outside, moved closer four wide late in the turn then stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
CATANIA broke alertly from the inside, clear into the first turn, set all the pace in the two path, drew out through the lane under steady handling. WEST
SIDE GIRL off step slow, raced back while saving some ground first turn, moved closer in traffic late in the final turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied
while continued to be surrounded by rivals, finished well to be up in time. PERSISTO settled off the pace while well wide early, continued outside and was
four wide again through the second bend, closest to the winner a furlong out, weakened a bit to be caught for the place, narrowly saved the show.
KALALOU void of speed while in traffic entering the first turn, continued back, came five wide out of the final turn, displayed some late interest down the
middle of the strip to miss the show. BID FOR POWER off a step slow, five wide into the first turn when well back, moved in a bit to be three wide through
the second turn, finished up one paced. LEA RO in the second flight just off the inside, continued two path final turn, raced in some traffic late in that bend
then lacked a significant closing response when clear. CLOSE TO ME four wide when well off the pace through the first turn, continued outside, five to six
wide turning into the stretch, failed to produce a rally. WAY TOO SMARTE off a step slow, back early, middle move four wide, gave way in the drive. FIERY
LADY in mid pack early, dropped to the inside second turn, waited, shuffled back then steadied along the rail entering the stretch, picked off a couple of
tiring rivals when clear. SOCIAL CIRCLE chased the winner early, moved a bit closer before a half then gave way. HOPING FOR A RING was finished after
a half. LOVELY LADY LEXI forwardly placed for a half, stopped.

Footnotes
OJITOS raced in the second flight after breaking with the field, moved closer in the four path turning for home, lost considerable ground to the runner up as
a result, set down for the drive, late push to nip that same rival at the wire. WHELEN SPRINGS vied up front along the inside, continued to narrowly show
the way through upper stretch, extended that advantage a bit with less than a furlong remaining, nipped late by the winner, clear of the others. EV'S
SHERMAN contested the issue up front while between rivals, continued to force the issue past the furlong marker, proved stubborn until late, saved the
show. WHERE'S RANDY off a step slow, lacked speed, came five wide and between horses into the lane, brushed, staged a mild rally to improve position.
ALLO ENRY in mid pack early, saved ground through the turn, went evenly in the drive. KILGORE in the main body off the inside, came four wide out of the
turn, one paced to the wire as well in lacking a closing response. JACKYS BACK fell back after the start, raced in the two path while still well off the pace
turn, picked off some tiring rivals while not a serious threat. ATTA PARTY vied up front while racing three wide, first to blink turning into the stretch. FETCHS
BRAHM off slowly, fell further back when sluggish, passed a couple of faltering foes while never a factor. STREET COMMANDER in the second flight for a
half four wide, fanned six exiting the turn, backed up through the stretch. ORBITAL STARR off a step slow, was always outrun while four wide.

Footnotes
EGO last away, trailed early, began to move far turn, circled to the front five wide turning into the stretch, put a head in front when straightened for home and
drove clear. COLOSI closest to the leader after moving out a bit in the first turn, chased up the backstretch, took over from that same rival late in the final
turn, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner in upper stretch then could not keep pace, all out to last for the place. GAMBLER'S FALLACY lacked
speed, began a three to four wide advance in the second turn, set down for the drive, getting to the runner up late. BOTSWANA five wide when well off the
pace through the second turn, continued to race outside, four wide through the second bend, widest in the drive, improved a bit. PINSON within striking
distance while three wide, came up empty for the drive. CASHANOVA lacked speed, saved ground far turn, shuffled back to trail behind traffic late in that
bend, moved out into the lane for room, passed tiring rivals. RIVER CACTUS settled off the pace, lacked a response in the drive. TASHKENT broke alertly,
clear early, set the pace, gave way when headed by the runner up turning for home. KING FORD raced in the second flight inside, backed up through the
stretch.

Footnotes
SARAH HARPER moved up to take control after the start, pace off rail, moved out a bit for the drive, clear, kept to task. NOVEL SQUALL off step slow, four
to five wide turn, drifted past the furlong marker, finished up willingly when straightened. ALBERTA SUN pressured the winner for a half in the three path,
weakened gradually through the lane, lasted comfortably for the show. BREAK CURFEW broke a step slow, moved out to race three wide through much of
the turn when off the pace, managed to displayed a modest amount of late interest. CHERISHED behind the leaders, raced four wide through the turn,
came up empty for the drive. NORTHERN DIAMOND failed to menace while racing in the two path. RECODED off a step slow, saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
STRONG TIDE tracked the along the inside after breaking in good order, continued to stalk into the far turn, worked way out three wide to challenge by late
in that bend, took over and drew clear in track record time. MY SIXTH SENSE prompted the early leader after moving off the inside in the first turn, chased
that one up the backstretch, challenged inside the winner and between rivals entering the stretch, could not keep pace with the winner the final furlong,
clearly second best. TRIDENT HIT settled off the pace well off the inside, three to four wide second turn, lacked a closing response. NIGHT OPS last to
leave, trailed off the rail, three wide into the lane, staged a mild rally while not a serious threat to the top three. TAISHAN showed the way early, shook clear
before a half, continued to show the way into the far turn, offered little resistance to the top two when confronted late in that bend and gave way when
headed. YOU'RE TO BLAME lacked speed along the inside, saved ground to no avail. TENFOLD raced off the inside early, four wide into the far turn, had
nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
LEAGUE OF LEGENDS within striking distance outside, ranged up to challenge four wide turning for home, long drive, proved best under firm handling.
STRATOFORTRESS in the second flight toward the inside early, moved out three wide bid turning for home, took over, showed the way past the furlong
marker, gave ground grudgingly to the winner late. VICTORY MARCH off a step slow, raced outside, four wide through the turn, narrowly held the show late.
GO WEST lacked early foot, four wide exiting the turn, staged a mild rally to narrowly miss the show. CRONUS off a step slow, raced back and outside, five
wide out of the turn, improved position while not a serious threat. UNCLE BERLEY in the second flight early, fell back through the turn while angling in a bit,
improved slightly by passing tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. TAXIT broke with the leaders, fell back while dropped in toward the inside turn,
came up empty for the drive. BEST BET sprinted clear soon after breaking well, set the pace for a half then gave way when confronted in the drive.
PREGAME remained back in failing to menace. BENEDICTUS trailed throughout in showing little.
