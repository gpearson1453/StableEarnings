Footnotes
SEIZE THE DAY , snugly rated mid way down the backstretch, advanced along the inner rail to take command approaching the turn, remained along the
rail, held sway under urging and galloped around the track after the finish. VOLTAMOUR stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide and rallied.
STRAIGHT UP GUY bumped with DA;ER'S DRINK soon after the break, raced forwardly in the two path between horses on the turn, remained inside rivals
in the stretch and flattened out. BOURBON AND ICE set the early pace off the rail, raced in the two path around the turn, floated to the three path in upper
stretch and weakened. YOWZA YOWZA YOWZA bumped with DAPER'S DRINK leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail on the turn and failed to
rally. DAPER'S DRINK , jostled leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail on the turn, swung out turning for home and failed to be a factor.
MUCHACHO MACHO , wide leaving the turn, was not a factor. IMTHEPRINCE , always well off the inner rail, trailed.

Footnotes
DILLY DILLY PHILLY was sent from the gate and angled a bit to gain forward position, tracked three wide under some asking, bid outside ALWAYS
TALKING entering the lane, dueled under strong handling then gained a slim lead in mid stretch, kept up the battle to the sixteenth marker then kicked clear
late. ALWAYS TALKING quickly went clear and dropped in to set a rated pace two wide, dug in when collared soon into the stretch, dueled inside the winner
to about the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. CALYPSO GHOST , taken to rate off the pace while saving ground, eased out in upper stretch then
advanced between rivals under some hand urging, churned on and gained the show. BLUE SKY VENEZUELA chased the leaders while off the rail, circled
four wide into the stretch but came up empty in the final furlong. LADY MAGICA had speed inside and edged up to the inside of the leader past the five
eighths to prompt, eased back a bit nearing the turn, was under asking chasing into the lane then faded. ELOQUENT LADY , three wide pursuing, was
trying to get out a bit around the turn, wandered six wide and gave way. DANNY DEEP CUTS broke slowly, dropped far back and was eased late.

Footnotes
NOTION INTERRUPTUS broke a step slow, edged up in hand leaving the five eighths to be forward, stalked a contested pace mid turn, eased out into the
lane, shifted further out in mid stretch, straightened and closed determinedly under pressure and forged ahead in the final jumps. HUFFLEPUFF vied three
deep, shook clear past the three sixteenths, kept on under solid handling past the sixteenth pole, finished gamely but just could not contain the winner.
AMERICAS WOMAN , off the pace while saving ground, angled out advancing nearing the lane, worked between runners in mid stretch and closed steadily.
ONE NIGHT STAND , pinched back at the break, regrouped and saved ground off the pace, swung out seven wide for the drive and had belated action.
RAPIDAMENTE stalked the pace off the rail, advanced four wide between rivals nearing the stretch but failed to seriously kick on in the final furlong.
WINDRUSH KARMA , away alertly, sparred between rivals to the quarter pole, raced three wide in upper stretch and weakened. GYPSY'S IMAGE , five
wide, ranged up outside rivals past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and faded. EASY ON THE SUGAR dueled inside a pair
of rivals for a half mile, ceded command in upper stretch and faltered through the final furlong. FLAVA'S DREAM bobbled at the break and was outrun.
EXPECT THE SUNRISE , sluggish from the gate, was used wide early and faltered.

Footnotes
SUNDAY MISCHIEF accelerated to the early lead, set the pace off the rail and was kept to his business in the drive. PRINCE OF FENTON lacked speed,
saved ground around the turn, eased off the rail turning for home and split horses near the eighth pole. BLISS THIS , four deep entering the turn, chased the
winner to the stretch, remained on his left lead and faltered the final furlong. JUSTFORSPEIGHTOFIT worked between horses on the turn and lacked a
rally. ESPRESSO LUNGO , outrun, was five deep entering the stretch. QUITE READY saved ground on the turn and weakened in the stretch. IRISH
BOOLUM lacked speed, raced along the inner rail in the stretch and was never a factor. TIZ A GIANT , wide on the turn, was outrun. CALL ME A
DREAMER chased the early pace racing along the rail and gave way.

HOPE HAS A NAME , away alertly, dueled two wide outside AWAY TO RETURN, gained a short lead in mid stretch and held firm after and extended drive.
AWAY TO RETURN broke a step slow, recovered and accelerated to the inside of rivals to join the pace fray, dueled on a short lead past the five sixteenths
and into the lane, lost the advantage in mid stretch but kept on valiantly to the wire. SWEET HOME DIXIE , three wide outside a rival early on, circled four
wide into the lane and churned on. VIBRANCY saved ground in range of the pace scrum, edged up leaving mid stretch then flattened out late. FLASHY
CHARGE , off last after stumbling, found herself far back after a quarter mile, raced three wide into the stretch, swung out for the final furlong and finished
with interest. MISS CHESAPEAKE , two wide and to the inside of a rival early on, was under heavy pressure mid turn but failed to respond. MENDING ,
away alertly, sat a perfect trip three wide spying the dueling leaders, was coaxed along to maintain position past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on leaving
the three sixteenths and faded. BACKSTREET GAL , sluggish from the gate, lagged well back, angled wide for the drive but failed to threaten.

Footnotes
MARVELLA NASTY prompted the pace two wide, secured command mid way on the turn and pulled away with something in reserve. TEQUILA FOG saved
ground around the turn, eased out to the two path approaching the stretch and had a mild rally inside horses. DEVILISH AFFAIR bumped with RAN CHAR
at the break, four wide on the turn, floated to the five path in upper stretch and failed to sustain her move. MAUREENLOVESFRANK , three wide chasing
the pace around the turn, weakened. TWIRLING WIND showed speed along the inner rail and gave way in upper stretch. RAN CHAR bumped with
DEVILISH AFFAIR at the start, hugged the inner rail on the turn, gave way and was eased late.

Footnotes
SWING WEST vied inside a pair of rivals early on, eagerly went clear heading towards the turn, opened up under a light hold mid turn, responded when
roused two wide in upper stretch, kept on under solid handling past the furlong grounds, drifted out some late and held firm to keep SOLOMONIC at bay.
SOLOMONIC , well placed off the inside, picked up the chase three wide past the three eighths, gave hard pursuit of the winner through the lane and stayed
on well. BELLARMINE HALL disputed the early pace between runners, eased back leaving the three quarter pole, dropped further back leaving the half mile
marker, saved ground under pressure into the stretch and came back willingly. SPOTTED BULL , bumped at the break, was taken to rate inside, eased out
leaving the far turn, circled four wide making some progress into the stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. BAHAMA CHANNEL , bumped at the start,
was urged three wide between runners past the half mile marker but failed to generate a solid kick. CLUBMAN leaned in at the break and caused a chain of
bumping, lost ground four to five wide and failed to rally. TWITTY CITY , bumped at the break, dropped far back early and failed to threaten. BARDOLINO ,
quickly to the front, was joined by a pair of runners to his inside leaving the chute, battled three deep, chased the winner leaving the far turn, stayed on to
about the five sixteenths then retreated.

Footnotes
ARMANDO R stumbled at the break, circled the turn three deep, angled to the six path in mid stretch, closed strongly, swept to command about forty yards
from the finish and drew out. MOHAAFETH stalked the pace three wide around the turn, advanced to challenge for the lead near the eighth pole and
flattened out. FRIENDLY FELLA sprinted to the early lead, set a comfortable pace in the two path around the turn, remained in the two path in the stretch
and tired the final furlong. TIZ MANDATE saved ground around the turn, angled out in upper stretch and failed to rally in an even effort. ROYAL NUMBER
hugged the inner rail, chased the pace to the eighth pole and gave way. INK raced in the two path around the turn and was not a factor. SASSY KING ,
along the inner rail throughout, was never a factor. REASSURED trailed.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC FRONTIER , five wide into the first turn, dropped in soon after then pulled his way up between rivals, steadied briefly approaching the
backstretch, was nicely handled as the five others got involved in a pace battle past the five eighths, saved ground and edged up leaving the far turn, sat
idled past the five sixteenths, took advantage of a seam along the rail entering the lane, burst through to challenge, quickly cleared then eagerly widened
while ridden out. ICY MINISTER , bumped at the break, bid five deep to entertain the pace leaving the five furlong pole, dropped in some then came back to
bid for the lead approaching the stretch, drifted out from left handed asking soon after, was corrected and kept on with some interest to be clearly second
best. VIRGINIA FULLA came out at the break and bumped with a rival, vied four wide between runners past the five eighths, dropped back past the five
sixteenths then out kicked a tiring rival to get the show in the final jumps. WATERMELON CRUSH rated back off foes early, was used along the rail to
challenge rivals past the five furlong pole, briefly went clear, was re engaged around the final turn, sparred to the quarter pole then weakened. HOLIDAY
AVENUE vied three wide between runners mid way through the backstretch, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths and weakened. KAZU took a slim lead
inside foes while two wide around the first turn, was engaged from both sides heading to the five eighths, failed to go on leaving the three eighths and
faltered.
