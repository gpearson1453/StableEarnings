Footnotes
CUSTOM SIERRA stalked the clear leader from the two path, ranged up to bid in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, led at the furlong grounds,
and drew off. P T'S FLASH raced off of the pace in the three path around the turn, tipped four wide in upper stretch, then to the six path approaching the
furlong grounds to be outside of a drifting CRYPTORITHM, then rallied to reach place inside the final sixteenth. GRAND PRIORITY tracked two wide,
chased through midstretch as the eventual winner kicked away, claimed place at the sixteenth pole, but was outfinished by an outer rallying rival for that
position late. CRYPTORITHM tracked three wide, ranged up turning for home, but drifted outwardly in upper stretch, got outkicked for minors approaching
the final sixteenth, and kept on to catch a tiring foe. LOUISIANA THUNDER sped clear early on, met CUSTOM SIERRA's challenge in upper stretch, was
bested at the furlong grounds, and faltered. YOAKAM failed to factor. RICHARDS DREAM raced far back along the inside, and made little impact. DAVES
FRIEND DEWEY chased along the inside, but faded through the lane. BROOK IS GOLDEN bobbled at the start, laid off of the pace in the four path, and
tired turning for home.

Footnotes
HOLY EMPEROR tossed his head inconsequently at the start, tracked from midpack along the inside, was driven to launch his rally two wide and between
horses at the five sixteenths pole, tipped outside of the leading trio inside the quarter pole, rallied to bid at the sixteenth marker, and drove clear. GUNNER
PAUL vied inside of HOT STOVE LEAGUE, prevailed in the long battle at the sixteenth pole, but was bested by an outer rallying rival soon after, then just
saved place. FULL DINNER JACKET saved ground far off of the pace, rated two wide and between horses around the far turn before shooting five wide at
the quarter pole, then rallied with a good kick in the final furlong, but missed reaching place on the wire. HOT STOVE LEAGUE vied for the lead two wide,
sustained the long duel through midstretch, but yielded a sixteenth out. GROOM LAKE stalked the leading pair from the outside, pressed them around the
far turn, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, got outkicked at the furlong grounds for minor rewards, then kept on while hanging on his left lead.
RONITHELIMODRIVER rated far back two wide and between horses, took the far turn in the five path before floating to the six path entering the lane, and
moved up. ANICLUDE tracked along the inside, then faltered without cause into the far turn losing multiple lengths of positioning, saved ground far off of the
pace around the far turn, and failed to re-rally. BOLD MINISTER broke a step slowly, trailed around both turns, and failed to factor. EXCLAIM raced in
midpack in the four path, drifted to the five path entering the lane, and faded thereafter. FIFTYFIVE STRONG tracked two wide, then along the inside
around the far turn, but faded in midstretch. FLYING CURLIN raced off of the pace three wide, and weakened between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
SCHNELL pressed outside of the pace setter while inside of another rival, bid passing the quarter pole, and drew off at the furlong grounds. GOLD PUNCH
set the pace along the inside, but proved no match for an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, and was second best. MUCHO MARVIN laid off of the pace
two wide, shifted four wide at the quarter pole, and stayed on to reach show at the furlong marker. BOURBON ST TAPPIN was slow into stride and trailed

COURAGEOUSLY stalked two wide, bid outside of AWE SHACKLE turning for home, led while shifting to the four path at the quarter pole, and drove clear
through the final furlong. AWE SHACKLE took a bump from an inner foe at the start, set the pace while intentionally a path off of the rail, cut down into the
far turn, met COURAGEOUSLY's bid around that bend, got headed entering the lane, failed to keep pace at the furlong grounds, and held place. POLICY
OPTION tracked along the inside, then chased along the rail to claim show at the furlong grounds, and stayed on outside of the early pace setter late, but
failed to reach him for place. CITADEL stalked along the inside, tugged inside of the leader down the backstretch, but was restrained back to the pocket into
the far turn, tipped to the three path at the quarter pole, and chased the leaders home evenly. HALEYS SAILOR tracked two wide, then from between
horses turning for home, came into the lane in the four path, but lacked a kick to produce a bid, and faded. SMOKEY HARBOR laid off of the pace two wide,
inched closer three wide around the far turn, fanned to the five path entering the lane, but flattened out while flopping back to his left lead inside of the
furlong pole, and tired. CAVE HILL trailed, attempted a four wide gain outside of foes around the far turn, but failed to sustain a bid and was no factor.
ELUSIVE D'ORO bumped an outer foe at the start causing him to toss his head, then was briefly rank passing the wire for the first time, settled off of the
pace along the inside into the first turn, then trailed around the far turn, and was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
MISTY VEIL was sent between horses passing the wire for the first time to clear off into the first turn, managed a loose advantage down the backstretch,
then widened his margin passing the quarter pole. SUKI broke outwardly and bumped a foe, tracked along the inside, shifted three wide at the five
sixteenths pole while commencing a rally, came into the lane four wide as the leader kicked away, then gained place at the three sixteenths, and was
second best. PERFECT CHOICE was brushed by an inner foe at the start, stalked along the inside, chased the clear leader around the far turn, then was
outkicked by an outer foe for place at the three sixteenths pole. FIRE CORAL took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, trailed the field, shifted from
the two to the four path in upper stretch, and improved mildly. GIANNA'S GIFT stalked two wide, but faded three wide and between horse entering the lane.
JUDY'S WAY tracked two to three wide, but was outmoved by an inner foe at the five sixteenths pole, and faded. GOOD PENNY stumbled at the start,
raced off of the pace two to three wide around the first turn, then four wide around the far turn before fading.

NEW YEAR'S EVE took a mild bump from an inner foe at the start, rated at the rear two wide around the first turn, inched closer in hand in the two to three
path around the far turn, altered course to the five path in upper stretch for clear racing room, quickened after flopping back to his left lead at the furlong
grounds, then surged outside of the leading pair in the final sixteenth, and got up on the wire. PEARL EARRING stalked the loose leader from the outside,
bid for the lead two wide and between horses into the far turn, cleared passing the quarter pole, held sway through midstretch, but tired approaching the
final sixteenth, met a pair of late bids, and was nailed on the wire while saving place. WHENTHEDAWNBREAKS bobbled a bit at the start, tracked along the
inside while in the two path around the first turn, then two wide and between horses around the far turn while surpassing an inner tiring rival, switched
outside of the top pair at the quarter pole as PEARL EARRING shook away, flopped back to his left lead at the furlong grounds, then sustained a grinding
advance outside of the tiring leader, bid for the lead in the late stages as an outer rival did the same, but just missed. MAXINE MACHINE broke a step
slowly while bumped an outer foe a the start, settled at the rear along the inside, took the far turn in the three path, swung to the six path entering the lane,
and moved up. MISSION BELLE broke inwardly, stalked from the three path, bid three wide into the far turn, vied outside of PEARL EARRING around that
bend, but failed to keep pace at the quarter pole, then lugged inwardly multiple times through upper stretch while hanging on her left lead, and faltered.
BIZYMALINE laid off of the pace in the three path, tipped from the four path to the five path entering the lane, but failed to factor. LOLA FLO sped clear early
on, but met a pair of bids into the far turn, and weakened around that bend. CHARGING NELLIE saved ground off of the pace, but weakened around the far
turn, then was eased through the lane, and was vanned off after failing to return to be unsaddled.

Footnotes
AIN'T SHE DAHRLIN set the pace along the inside, inched clear of a prompting LOVE OF MY HEART at the quarter pole, then drew off through the final
furlong under strong hand urging. CURVETTE broke a bit flat-footedly while last away, tracked the leading trio, was urged along to keep pace in the three
path around the turn, tipped to the four path entering the lane, then chased the clear leader while mildly progressing through the final furlong, and reached
place on the wire. LOVE OF MY HEART broke a bit outwardly, prompted the pace three wide, vied two wide from the three path turning for home, but failed
to match strides in upper stretch, faded in the final furlong, and was nailed on the wire for place. AUNT JOIE pressed the pace two wide and between
horses, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, and lost show a sixteenth out. MELODY ROSE saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. ROOKERY
trailed the field in the four to five path, and was outrun.

Footnotes
ELLE Z set the pace along the inside of a pressing CHANGE OF CONTROL, resisted that rival's bid turning for home, battled gamely through the lane after
getting headed in upper stretch, and tenaciously regained an advantage on the wire to win a tight photo. CHANGE OF CONTROL pressed outside of the
pace setting ELLE Z, then from between horses into the turn, bid for the lead turning for home sparking a duel, forged a narrow advantage in upper stretch
as her resilient counterpart fought on, but was outgamed on the wire. BROOKE MARIE raced off of the pace along the inside into the turn, shifted three wide
at the five sixteenths pole to commence a rally, then stayed on between horses to claim show a sixteenth out. DRAPES bumped an outer foe at the start,
tracked the pace two wide, then chased through the lane without progressing. ONEROLLOFTHEDICE took a bump from an inner foe at the start, rushed
outside of rivals into the turn to press the pace three wide, but drifted outwardly while failing to keep pace with the leaders at the quarter pole, and tired. SHE
CAN'T SING was shuffled back behind a wall of horses at the half mile pole causing her to trail the field, switched three wide into the turn for clear sailing,
took the bend in the three to four path, but lacked a rally, and made little impact. PATHETIQUE tracked along the inside, but steadied hard approaching the
lane, and faded. EUPHORIC was outrun.

Footnotes
INTHEALY stalked the pace in the three path, pressed the leader around the turn, bid entering the lane, led passing the quarter pole, and held from a pair of
chasing rivals on either side. DUVEE tracked from the four path, then chased the leader through the lane, and reached place on the wire. COFFEE
COUNTY broke multiple paths outwardly at the start, stalked in the two path, split the leaders in upper stretch to attempt a bid inside of INTHEALY, but
flattened out in the late stages while getting repelled, and was nailed on the wire for place. MR ELVIN laid off of the pace in the two path, then stayed on for
a minor share. IT'S A BIRD raced outside of MR ELVIN around the turn, and chased along with that foe through the lane. ADIEU LE CHAT made little
impact. HALF MAGIC set the pace two wide, then inside of a pressing INTHEALY around the turn, but was headed by that foe while tucking to the rail at the
quarter pole, and weakened in upper stretch. MAXIMUM FURY broke slowly, then veered out sharply soon after while shying from an inner rival, trailed the
field around the turn, and never got involved. HOTPIN broke slowly, then rushed in the opening furlong to vie for the lead along the inside, but weakened
into the turn.
