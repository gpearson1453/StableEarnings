Footnotes
CREME DE LA CHROME dueled for the early advantage while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin inside the furlong marker and drew off while being
kept to task. GODGUNSNCOUNTRY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and was up for the place. SILVERBULLITBADGER
broke sharply to duel for the lead with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. DRISKILL was off a step slow, raced just
off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly. MR FREEBIE showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled
out further approaching the stretch and failed to threaten. KYNLIE'S EMPIRE was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn
and was not a factor. GATO SICILIANO veered in at the start, lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not offer a bid. WREXHAM
showed brief speed and weakened.

Footnotes
THE BEAT stalked the leaders while racing five-wide, moved up to take command nearing the furlong marker and drew clear. CLAVICHORD pressed the
pace while racing three-wide, moved up to engage nearing the three-sixteenths pole, led but could not match strides with the winner late. PROVOST chased
the leaders while racing four-wide and lacked the needed closing response. FULL DRAW set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way after going
three-quarters. TAKE CHARGE DEPUTY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. COURAGEOUS lagged
throughout.

Footnotes
FENESTRA was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with MR NAVIGATOR while racing three-wide, vied with that rival into deep stretch and
gamely prevailed. MR NAVIGATOR broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner, vied through a prolonged drive but could not get by that rival late.
REBEL WAR was reserved just off the leaders early, responded when set down for the drive and finished with a steady rally. SOMETHING SUPER was off
a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. HIT THE SEAM was forwardly placed early, moved
four-wide through the turn and gradually gave way. BROTHER ROBERT was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten. NO
PASA NADA settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and weakened. GOLDENEYED lacked early
foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FAMOUS ROCK STAR set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged into the lane by MR. VIEW and held that rival off gamely to the
wire. MR VIEW was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the winner into the lane, rider lost whip near the sixteenth
pole and could not get by that foe. VALLEY WILDCAT lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with a late bid. SMOOTH PAPA
pressed the pace from between foes and gave way in the drive. BLANK IT chased the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened. OVER EZ showed
no early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and was not a factor. CURRENTLY KRAZY lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not
offer a bid. JAQUET was off a step slow, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened.
