Footnotes
TINCANDANCE hard to load, broke slow, racing from the back, came around the turn on the outside, made a wide rally and got up in time. REMI'S ROSE
raced near the back in the beginning, saved ground around the turn, made a late rail bid and was outfinished for the win. SOUVENIR CHANNEL pressed
the pace, made a bid and was outfinished by the top two. LA SMOOCHIE dueled for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, took the advantage and
hung late. TIME TO SLEEP raced near the back, moved up and was no factor. CHARLIE SKY pressed the pace, came around the turn four wide and faded.
APRIORITY GIRL dueled on the front end, saved ground around the turn and dropped back. ELLIE'S A WILDCAT showed early speed and was finished
early. PADIOLI broke slow, raced in the rear and was never close.

TRICKY MOM vied for the early advantage, saved ground around the turn, drove clear down the lane and was kept to the task. ZIPITY raced within striking
distance, made an inside bid, proved no match for the winner, but held on for second. MY GAL CHARLOTTE lacked early speed, made a steady gain and
was outfinished for second. SPORT PALACE raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, made a late wide bid and closed well. CUPIE CUTIE raced
near the middle of the field, came around the turn five wide and put forth an even effort. E R'S MIREYA flashed early speed and faded. POINT ME OUT
pressed the early pace and was finished early. KEEP ON DREAMING was an early factor, came around the turn four wide and had nothing left late. MISS
EMMA JEAN broke slow, raced in the rear and never mounted a bid.

Footnotes
KING NATE unhurried in the early part, moved up on the outside around the final turn, entered the stretch wide, drove clear and finished well. LAST TO
KNOW void of early speed, saved ground around the final turn, made a late gain and got up for second. QUANA DUDE lacked early speed, entered the
home stretch five wide and was outfinished for second. FLAT OUT LOVE raced within contention, made a late inside bid and hung deep in the stretch.
SHAR'S TREASURE vied for the early lead, forwardly placed until late, weakened down the final stretch. HOT LE ROY raced near the back, had a wide trip
and was never a threat. PAT ME DOWN went to the front, saved ground and dropped back. SLOW was fractious in the gate, left without rider and walked
off.

THE BIG SHOW dueled for the early advantage, took command around the turn, pulled away down the lane and was ridden out. FAMOUS YANKEE
challenged on the front end, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but held on for second. BRIAR lacked early speed, saved ground
around the turn, made a late gain and missed second. WEDINGTON broke out sharply, racing near the back, came around the turn wide, made a mild bid,
but was no factor. IM JUST JOKIN pressed the early pace and weakened. MISCHIEVOUS DEVIL raced within contention, faded and finished wide. BLUE
RIDGE RED raced in the middle of the pack and faded. BAYOU SARGE void of early speed and showed little.

throughout, saved ground around the turn, made a rail bid and was a clear second. KENSLEY'S HIPPIE dueled on the front end, raced close throughout
and proved no match for the top two. B B MOODY challenged for the lead, dueled throughout and faded late. LENAPE DRIVE raced evenly near the back,
made a mild bid, but was no factor. FAZIO raced in the middle of the field, came around the turn wide and put forth an even effort. WONDER RUN raced
near the middle of the pack, weakened and was no threat late. RISKY STEPS raced evenly near the back and was never close. CROCODILE JACQUES
always raced near the back and was outrun.

JONATHAN WHO hesitated at the start, racing in the rear, moved up around the turn, swung to the outside entering the stretch, made an outside rally and
got up in time. NOSBOR unhurried in the early part, came around the turn wide, made a late bid and was outfinished for the win. PAPA BRO vied for the
early lead, took the advantage and was outkicked by the top two. LION HEART LEGEND dueled on the front end and lacked a finish. MCLEAN lacked early
speed, improved position, but was no factor. IMPACT PLAYER pressed the early pace, weakened and went to the wire evenly. O'L RED challenged for the
early lead and was finished early. PRAY IDE SING pressed the pace, came around the turn wide and retreated. KNOCKALITTLELOUDER showed early
speed and dropped back.
