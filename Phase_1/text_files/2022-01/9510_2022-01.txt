CALL THE PO PO dueled two wide for the lead, three wide on the turn, battled it out with SEA FRET passing the furlong marker and edged away late for
the win. SEA FRET dueled inside for the early lead, dueled with CALL THE PO PO into the stretch, dug in gamely on the rail and came up second best. NO
SYMPATHY was bumped at the start and off a bit slow, recovered quickly to chase the pace, made a brief rail bid on the turn, then angled out and finished
evenly. BIG EYE JOY chased three wide, lacked a rally and weakened in the lane. CONDUTTORE bobbled at the break and was bumped, chased between
rivals and tired. EVERYBODY'S PAL chased inside and gave way.

dug in gamely between horses in the final sixteenth and earned a share of the place spot. JARLIAN was fractious in the gate and off slowly, raced off the
pace inside, moved up five wide nearing the quarter pole, rallied five wide into the stretch, dueled, dug in gamely outside to the finish and shared second.

set a pressured pace inside and began stopping midway on the final turn. MR. AGALLAS prompted the leaders three wide for half a mile and stopped
abruptly.

COLONEL JUAN settled early, split rivals to the front at the three eighths pole, drew off and remained safe driving. RUBY BLEU stalked the pacesetters
three wide, was asked on the final turn and continued willingly for the place. ROAN MOUNTAIN trailed early, angled very wide and finished well while no
threat. THORNY TALE forced the pace outside, tried to move with the winner but faltered in the stretch. BARINGER SPRING saved ground off the pace,
faded before half a mile and was no factor. EXCHEQUER moved clear briefly inside, was pressured into the far turn and stopped.

DIVINE HUNTRESS raced off the rail, off the pace, three wide on the backside, made a strong three wide bid on the far turn, quickly took charge, pulled
away and galloped home in hand. BURANO stalked three wide, bid two wide entering the far turn, was no match for the winner and well clear for the place
award. LANDSLID raced two wide off the pace, chased the leaders on the far turn, lacked a bid and earned the show spot. SEA PINES raced off the pace
inside, chased the leaders on the far turn and had no rally. EXTRA CRUNCHY tracked on the inside, chased, gave way, was eased up in deep stretch and
walked off. COLLIN'S GREY LADY set the pace racing a bit off the inside, dueled briefly on the far turn, lugged out at the quarter pole, was pulled up and
walked off.

SHOOGER RAY TOO settled off the leaders outside, bid into the stretch and edged away driving. MAYBE AFTER LATER took over after three furlongs,
was collared into the stretch, could not stay with the winner but held on gamely. LUXERO vied inside, eased to the outside after the half, bid in midstretch
but was outfinished. OLYMPIC ROMP unhurried early, advanced near the inside with a mild rally. FAST BOB chased wide throughout, faded after half a
mile and proved empty late. EDDIE'S CHARGE dropped back outside and was never in contention. RONIN WARRIOR angled inside on the first turn then
stopped after three quarters. ICY DUDE lagged far behind and trailed throughout.
