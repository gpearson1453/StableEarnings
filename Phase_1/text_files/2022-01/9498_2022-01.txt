Footnotes
MUCHO DEL ORO was off slow and impeded at the start, advanced up the backstretch, bid three wide around the turn, cleared in midstretch and held over
the runner-up. GOLD PHOENIX (IRE) was off slow and broke inward then lost his path at the start, trailed early then went outside a rival, tipped three wide
leaving the turn, closed well in the final furlong but was too late. NEWPARK (IRE) set the pace from inside, cleared past the half-mile pole, held a short lead
into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and flattened to third. ELUSIVE TREAT (GB) dropped back early and moved inside, tipped two wide into the
lane, angled out in upper stretch and summoned a mild rally. I'LL STAND TALLER broke inward, steadied slightly off heels past the half-mile pole, exited the
turn two wide and lacked a rally. NOBLE REFLECTION showed early speed outside the leader, chased that rival leaving the backstretch, went two wide
around the bend and weakened. TIGERHON (FR) chased along the inside, steadied briefly off heels into the turn, saved ground to the stretch and failed to
menace. RUN SNAPPY stalked off the rail then angled in entering the turn and faded.

bend and lacked a late bid. SCREAM AND SHOUT broke a step slow, went up to duel for command along the rail into and around the turn, then weakened
down the lane. TIPPY TOP came away a bit slow, settled inside, exited the turn two wide and had little left for the stretch.

Footnotes
FLORAL ESSENCE got bumped from outside at the start, stalked from inside then went up to press between rivals, took over past the three-eighths pole,
cleared at the quarter pole, drew away in upper stretch, then lasted in the closing moments. ACOUSTIC SHADOW was off a bit slow from outside, stalked in
the two path entering the far turn, was caught in some traffic and angled three wide past the quarter pole, rallied through the final furlong but was too late.
WITCH MOON settled in the two path early, looked to make a run but lacked room into the stretch, steered out to a clear path, rallied late and prove a game
third. GOLDEN JOURNEY pulled and steadied on the first turn, stalked from inside, tipped two wide and was coaxed along at the five-sixteenths pole but
weakened in the stretch. TWIRLING GRACE broke in and bumped at the start, attended the pace three deep, lost touch into the far turn, chased four to five
wide into the lane and tired. LADY MACARENA got bumped on both sides at the start, vied between briefly then cleared nearing the first turn, set the pace
inside a pair of rivals up the backstretch, lost command past the three-eighths pole, could not keep up with a quarter mile left to run and tired in the lane.

TOM BOMBADIL chased early then went up to vie between rivals, was outrun into the turn, exited the bend four wide, re-bid with a furlong left to run and
dug in late to outkick CARELESS KITTEN and DUTCH BUS in the final sixteenth. CARELESS KITTEN vied for the lead two wide then moved to the rail,
could not keep up with the top pair early on the bend, got put in tight by VARRAGIO angling to the rail on the turn, steered out to the three path, re-bid
outside the leaders with a furlong left, took a brief lead in midstretch but got outkicked by the winner. DUTCH BUS broke well from outside, pressed the
pace five then four deep, dueled four wide into the turn, battled two wide into the stretch, lost the lead in upper stretch but stayed on well from inside and
missed second. BIG WELL raced up close on the inside, chased into the turn, lacked room behind rivals past the five-sixteenths pole, angled in leaving the
bend and kept on for a minor award. THE BOSS HARTY was off slow and lagged behind early, angled to the two path on the turn then steered back out four
wide entering the stretch and never threatened. VERRAGIO vied four then three deep on the backstretch, dueled three wide into the turn, angled down to
the rail, then weakened in the lane. ROCKETCENT chased outside rivals and steadied early, went three to four wide around the turn and tired.

stretch, kicked clear and coasted in nearing the wire. FEARLESS GIRL (IRE) was off slow and broke in a bit, sat off the pace, drew closer leaving the
backstretch, got blocked behind the early pacesetter on the far turn, tipped out at the quarter pole, finished well but could not threaten the winner. BUZZ OF
NEW YORK (IRE) tracked outside a pair of rivals early then moved into the two path for the clubhouse turn, traveled between rivals on the backstretch,
stayed off the rail into the stretch, split foes in deep stretch and gained the show. CIDER APPLE (GB) unhurried in the beginning and moved inside, moved
out and went between rivals in the middle stages, advanced three then four wide on the second turn but faltered in the lane. SOMMER DAISY (FR) got
bumped from outside at the start, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, closed in nearing the far turn, drew alongside and took over with at the quarter
pole, lost command into the stretch and weakened. DERBY QUEST turned his head, broke in and bumped rival at the start, settled in two then three wide
outside a rival at the back, went three deep on the backstretch, exited the bend three wide and was not a factor. NOBLE HEARTED rated along the inside,
saved ground around the far turn then tipped out into the stretch but came up empty. SOARING SKY (IRE) opened up a large lead early, held a diminishing
lead into the far turn, lost command with a quarter mile left to fun and folded.

NEIGE BLANCHE (FR) ceded the lead early and stalked inside, moved closer along the rail but lacked room at the seven-sixteenths pole then brushed the
rail shortly after, waited for room around the final bend, tipped out into the stretch, closed fast and overhauled DISAPPEARING ACT in the final stages.
DISAPPEARING ACT stalked the leader in the two path, bid outside on the final bend, took over into the stretch, cleared with three-sixteenths remaining but
yielded to the winner late. SCHERZO (GB) hit the gate and got brushed from inside at the start, was bothered by the same rival and steadied entering the
first turn, advanced three to four wide on the final turn and flattened out in the stretch. FROSE sped clear to establish the front, controlled the pace through
the early stages, pressured by rival on the final bend, lost the lead into the stretch and weakened. REIWA broke out and brushed rival at the start, pulled a
bit entering the first turn, stalked in the two path, coaxed two then three wide leaving the final turn and weakened.

Footnotes
BIG BUZZ trailed three then four wide on the first turn, advanced four wide on the second bend, reached the front in upper stretch and drew clear.
UNBROKEN STAR sped to the front from inside, took pressure on the backstretch then cleared past the half-mile marker, tested again by BUTTERED
NOODLES at the quarter pole, held a short lead into the stretch, relinquished control to BIG BUZZ in upper stretch but stayed on well for second.
BUTTERED NOODLES chased in the two path and brushed with outside rival on the first turn, went up to press the leader from between foes, lost contact
past the half-mile pole, re-bid alongside with a quarter mile left to run but weakened in the late stages. GOING WITH STYLE brushed with rival while three
wide on the first turn, pressed the pace three deep up the backstretch, lost some ground around the far turn, exited that bend three wide, weakened in the
lane, bled following the race and walked off. TEMBO settled along the inside early on, moved out to the two path on the backstretch, traveled along the
inside to the far turn, eased off the rail into leaving the second bend and lacked the needed response. SLY settled three to four wide on the first turn, went
two then three wide on the second bend and came up empty.

Footnotes
BYE BYE BERTIE pulled and steadied from the rail on the first turn, stalked the top trio in the middle stages, angled three then four wide on the second
bend, rallied four deep in the stretch, surged clear and won going away. KLEEN KARMA was off slow from outside, advanced four wide around the first turn,
vied three deep up the backstretch, battled around the turn and into the lane, could not kick on with the winner in deep stretch but held the place. CLEARLY
GONE steadied off heels on the first turn, tracked along the rail and brushed with rival near the three-eighths pole, tipped out leaving the far turn, angled
down to the rail but could not find room, steered back to the outside and got up for the show. TRICKLE IN was forwardly placed in the two path on the first
turn, went up to vie for the lead while taking control in hand, battled around the far turn and down the stretch, was no match in the final sixteenth and got
edged for the show. A NEW PEACE took control early, vied with a pair of rivals from inside, fought hard to deep stretch and flattened late. OVER
ATTRACTED tracked two wide and had to check between rivals on the first turn, brushed with rival near the three-eighths pole, angled to the rail around the
bend, lacked the needed response and tipped out late. ZABAVA went three deep around the first turn, trailed off the rail up the backstretch, went three then
two wide around the second bend and had little left for the drive. NICE ICE climbed for a bit early prior to the first turn, rated in the three path, driven three
wide into the lane and tired.
