Footnotes
PIONEER PRIDE vied for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, pulled clear and won under steady urging. IMA SUNNY SONG broke in, showed
early speed, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but held on for second. MONZZA raced in the middle of the field, came around
the turn on the inside, made a bid and was outfinished for second. WICKED FITZ challenged on the front end and lacked a late kick. SING LOUD shuffled
back at the start, moved up to the middle of the field and finished evenly. BRAD EYE bothered at the start, raced near the back and was never close.
TRAELEE always raced near the back and showed little. EBONY FLASH broke out, raced within contention in the beginning and faded. LUCKY PEGASUS
had an awkward start, raced in the back and was never a threat.
