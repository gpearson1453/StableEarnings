Footnotes
TERAWATT dueled up the backstretch off the inside, shook off the other speed to be clear in the bend, given a breather soon after, shrugged off a mild bid
nearing the furlong marker, clear again to the wire under steady handling. MEGA CHARLIE settled off the early pace, angled in when advancing to save
ground into the lane, brief bid inside the winner nearing midstretch, proved no match the final furlong, clearly second best. BOURBON DELIGHT broke
back, lacked speed, floated out five wide turning for home, mild rally down the middle of the strip to be along for the show. BLAME GEORGE broke in and
slowly, lacked speed, raced three out four wide when moving a bit closer turning for home, flattened out in the final furlong. HARRY dueled up front inside
the winner up the backstretch and began to fade. OSIYO saved ground to no avail. SPA broke back, trailed in the run up the backstretch just off the inside,
raced three wide through the turn and was not a factor in the drive drive. FREER forwardly placed while racing three wide for four furlongs, gave way
through the stretch.

Footnotes
HONORARY DEGREE broke on top, set the pace in the two path after being angled in, pulled away steadily through the lane while being kept to pressure.
INCORRUPTIBLE away in good order, chased the winner in the three path, could not keep pace with that one through the lane, remained clear fore the
place. THE FEATURE back off the early pace along the inside, moved off the rail late backstretch, steered out again in some traffic while three wide turning
for home, rallied to be closest to the top two nearing the furlong marker, did little with that pair in the late going while saving the place in the final strides.
VIOLENT GIGI off a step slow, raced back off the pace toward the inside, came three wide into the lane, improved with some late interest and was gaining
for the show spot late. HOLDING PATTERN also away slowly, raced back and outside, four out to five wide through the turn, improved with some modest
late interest. TRAIL DRIVER settled in the second flight off the inside, had little left for the drive. AFRICAN WARRIOR off the pace while racing along the
inside, weakened in the drive. HARD TO PARK off slowly, void of speed, steered out a bit in some traffic turning for home, picked off a few tiring rivals
nearing midstretch while never a threat. SPORTY FLYER another who was off slowly, failed to menace. BEAUMONT BEAUX lacked speed, four wide
through the turn, failed to muster a rally. AMERICAN CHAOS within striking distance in the early going, steady fade. FUNANDFUNNY lacked speed while
four wide into the turn, roused, steered in a bit then gave way soon after.

TAPALONG took command from the start, clear late backstretch, steadily increased that advantage through the turn, roused approaching midstretch,
continued to draw out to the wire under a brisk hand ride. LOVELY LADY LEXI broke well, fell back off the winner and chased that one into the turn,
continued that pursuit through the bend, proved no match in the drive, held sway for the place. LIL MISS HOT MESS off slowly, raced well off the pace, in
some traffic late in the turn, split foes when straightened for home and was steadily gaining for the second spot. DIVA DE KELA lacked early speed along
the inside, continued to save ground through the turn, improved slightly in the drive without posing a serious threat. BOATHOUSE VIEW in the second flight
while between horses, four wide into the stretch, failed to muster a rally. FIELD DAISEY forwardly placed for a half, had little left for the stretch run. LADY
GUSTO four wide into the turn when well back, three wide into the lane, failed to muster a rally. LADY MAGNA finished early, fell far back, jogged in late.

IPSUM GRATUS within striking distance, advanced in the two path and took over late in the final turn, slight drift when clear a furlong out, drew out the final
furlong under a firm right handed crop. AUTOSTRADA settled in the second flight off the inside, was four wide when moving slightly closer in the final turn,
up late to gain the nod for the place, no threat to the winner. MY CORALENA broke alertly, showed the way into the first turn, clear in the run up the
backstretch, began to gradually weakened when headed late in the second turn, narrowly lost the place late. BAJA FOG away in good order, stalked the
pace off the inside, three wide while remaining within striking distance stretch, lugged out with a furlong remaining then finished up evenly. SIMPLY
BEGUILED four wide through the first turn when well off the pace, improved slightly the third quarter, lacked a closing kick in the drive. BRIAR THICKET last
away, failed to menace while racing toward the inside. SMOKING BOSSA NOVA remained always back. ALITA four wide into the first turn when racing in
mid pack, stopped after six furlongs to finish up far back.

Footnotes
CHICKEN HAWK broke well, allowed the leader to go early, tracked that one into the turn in the three path, challenged outside that one inside the furlong
grounds, wore that rival down under firm handling. HERITAGE PARK sprinted clear soon after the start, showed the way into and through the turn in the two
path, continued to show the way by daylight past the furlong marker, responded when the winner came alongside late, gave ground grudgingly to that one,
well clear of the others. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN settled off the pace just off the inside, chased the top two into the lane in the two path, did not seriously
threaten those two late, well clear of the others. MR. COUGAR off a step slow, raced back early, steadily improved position just off the inside while not a
serious threat. BURTNJOE forwardly placed early, two out to three wide through the turn, came up empty for the stretch run. MARVELOUS THUNDER
settled off the early leaders, crept a bit closer while saving ground in the turn, flattened out in the run through the stretch. MAX BET lacked early foot off the
inside, steered in a bit in the /turn, made little impact in the run through the stretch. STOMPING HOTROD in the second flight well out in the strip for a half,
came four out to five wide into the lane, backed up in the run to the wire. DESTINEDTOBEASTAR raced in mid pack and off the inside, four wide exiting the
turn, failed to menace while remaining back. C H JAY stumbled start, trailed for a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided.
KAT'S HITMAN was never a factor off the inside. JAMES'S MOONSHINE tired while racing four wide through the turn.

JAZZY LADY last away, raced back while off the inside, continued in the two path second turn, dropped inside for room late in that bend, squeezed up
inside the leader to challenge when straightened for home, edged clear under firm handling while drifting out slightly the final sixteenth. TEXAS RAIN broke
on top, set the pace off the inside, continued to show the way through the second bend in the two path, could no match the winner late, well clear of the rest.
ABSOLUTE LOVE prompted the leader from the three path for six furlongs, had little for that rival or the runner up in the drive, clear of the rest. BID FOR
POWER forward and four wide in the first turn, continued outside, four wide again in the second bend, had little for the drive. LEA RO inside when off the
pace through the first turn, raced two to four wide through the second, had nothing for the drive. TAKE CHARGE GAL was finished after a half, far back.

Footnotes
WINTERWOOD forwardly placed early outside, four wide onto the backstretch, closer while remaining four wide through the final bend, took over into the
lane, drew clearly best under steadily handling through the lane. GROUP EIGHTEEN raced back off the early pace just off the inside, closer in the second
turn, dropped inside exiting the final turn, proved no match for the winner the final furlong, clear for theplace. COLE SPUR sprinted clear soon after the start,
moved out into the two path before a quarter, rated through a soft three quarter split, allowed the runner up the inside into the lane then proved no match for
that one or the winner. OILER prompted leader in the three path, called on for run turning into the stretch, came up empty for the drive. VIGANO settled in
mid pack and in the two path, turned in an even effort throughout. DECLARE THE MOON in the second flight inside, continued to save ground through the
final turn, had little for the drive. MESMERIZED four wide in the first turn when off the pace, three wide through the second, failed to muster a rally. LA
FLECHA remained back in failing to menace. PRINCE DARE off a step slow, improved slightly the middle part then began to fade in the far turn. JACKYS
BACK four wide through the first turn, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S CHARGE broke to the inside but with the leaders, settled in closest to the leader, took over from that one from the outside, turning for home,
quickly clear, drew off under mostly his own courage to win ridden out. BEAVER HAT off step slow, raced back in traffic into the first turn, advanced in the
two path second turn, rallied for the place to finish up willingly, no threat to the winner. TRIDENT HIT void of speed inside, saved ground through the first
turn, continued inside through the second bend, shifted out nearing the furlong marker, rallied and was also going well at the end. SONNEMAN within
striking distance along the inside, continued to save ground second turn, came up empty for the drive. MO MOSA off a step slow, steadied slight in traffic
into the first turn, continued back, angled out four wide turning for home, improved position. FACT FINDING broke well, sprinted clear in the first turn,
showed the way up the backstretch, offered little resistance to the winner when that one challenged turning for home, weakened when headed. ALLEGE
void of speed was never dangerous while racing just off the inside. DIGITAL settled on the outside and off the pace, three wide through the second turn,
weakened steadily through the lane. CATDADDY steadied when in a bit tight when the winner broke in, continued back and was never a factor while four
wide throughout. SHARED SENSE sluggish from the start, fell further back, pulled up second turn, vanned off.

Footnotes
MY DAMS ATITUDE off the early pace, steered out five wide into the stretch, set down, finished with good resolve to collar the leader late, going away.
PUNCHY GIRL moved up to show the way up the backstretch, edged clear in the turn, extended that advantage despite lugging a bit in upper stretch, could
not contain the winner in proving not match, comfortably clear for the place. RUN FEARLESS in mid pack early while racing outside, four wide through the
turn, displayed a mild amount of late interest to be up late for the show. CHOCTAW CHARLIE in the second flight while racing off the inside, four wide into
the lane, continued in even fashion through the lane to finish up evenly. BUCKLE BUNNY RED broke slowly, raced back, improved position while three wide
into the lane, improved. EPWORTH in the second flight while along the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground turn, came up empty for the
stretch run. MISS RITA pressed off the inside, three wide exiting the turn, tired in the drive. DANCIN N THEPULPIT made little impact in racing off the
inside. GRAMERCY PARK was off slowly, never serious involved. STORMY SERMON broke back and was always outrun. MO WANNA GO forwardly
placed early out in the strip, staged a steady retreat three wide.
