Footnotes
CRAFTY PRINCESS rated off of the pace two wide and between horses, improved among rivals around the far turn, then sustained a rally to split the
leaders with a furlong to go, and drew clear. RECKLESS SERGEANT took mild bumps from rivals on either side at the start, tracked in midpack from the
three path, inched closer while tipping three to four wide turning for home, bid approaching the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an inner foe, and
edged place. I'M A CUSTOM TO IT tracked three wide, bid for the lead outside of SCRAPPY into the far turn, led turning for home, but hung on his left lead
in upper stretch, then yielded between bidders passing the furlong grounds. LAKE RUNNER broke inwardly and brushed the gate, but was put to tight
quarters inside of MAC LEGACY while forwardly placed into the first turn, smoothly rated back to midpack soon after, shifted two wide down the backstretch,
but was shuffled back behind that rival into the far turn to be far off of the pace at the three furlong pole, tipped six wide entering the lane, and rallied for a
minor share. JIG TIME BANDIT broke inwardly, then lost momentum when she got rank due to rider correction that kept her from bumping an inner rival,
saved ground far off of the pace, then improved between horses in the lane. MAC LEGACY put an inner LAKE RUNNER into tight quarters while achieving
an inside stalking position into the first turn, but lost that positioning into the far turn, sustained her chase around that bend, but faded through the lane. BAD
GAL RIRI bumped an inner foe at the start, trailed the field around both turns, swung eight wide entering the lane, and passed tired rivals. SCRAPPY set the
pace along the inside, but was headed by bidding rival turning for home, then weakened through the final furlong. TWO PUNCH FIST bumped an outer foe
at the start, prompted the pace two wide from the three path around the first turn, stalked into the far turn, but chased around that bend before weakening
entering the lane. ANSLIE'S GUMDROP hopped while breaking slowly, raced off of the pace while hung out four wide around both turns, and faded.

Footnotes
SUMMER IS HOT stalked along the inside, gained three wide around the far turn to take aim on a clear CHEAPSKATE DIVA entering the lane, but drifted
many paths outwardly in upper stretch while stalling her advance, straightened in the final furlong, bid at the sixteenth pole, and cleared. CHEAPSKATE
DIVA set the pace while tucking to the rail around the first turn, shook clear of pressing foes into the far turn, held sway through upper stretch as SUMMER
IS HOT pursued, dug in inside the final furlong, but was bested in the final sixteenth. SERIOUSLY SAM raced in midpack in the four to three path around
the first turn, then in the three to four path turning for home, but lugged inwardly and bumped CONNECT IT passing the quarter pole, drifted outwardly soon
after, but sustained a bid for show in midstretch as an outer MS. CAJUN QUEEN did the same, and fended that foe off to the wire. MS. CAJUN QUEEN
settled off of the pace in the three path, advanced in the four to five path and outside of foes around the far turn, sustained a bid for show in midstretch
outside of SERIOUSLY SAM, but remained on her left lead through the final furlong, and hung for that position. CONNECT IT tracked from midpack in the
two path, but was bumped by an outer SERIOUSLY SAM while in the three path passing the quarter pole, and kept on thereafter. MOMENT TO DREAM
veered inwardly at the start and severely hampered MON DANSEUR, settled far off of the pace in the two path, then in the three to four path around the far
turn before swinging to the six path entering the lane, but lacked a rally. SAVANNAH'S HERE laid close up two wide around the first turn, backed off to stalk
along the inside, but chased a clearing leader around the far turn, then lost show at the furlong grounds and weakened. SHELLI'S ANGEL raced far off of
the pace in the six to four path around the first turn, and never got involved. SKY HIGH SUSAN prompted the pace three to two wide, but failed to keep pace
with her inner counterpart into the far turn, chased between horses around that bend, and weakened entering the lane. RESPOSADO never got involved.
MON DANSEUR was forced inwardly and severely hampered at the start, trailed the field soon after, and got outrun.

Footnotes
MR. PETERKIN saved ground far off of the pace, commenced a rally into the far turn, closed in quickly on the top trio, split them three wide entering the
lane to bid at the quarter pole, and drove clear at the furlong grounds. COACH HUDSON set a quick pace inside of a stoutly pressing RIVER'S RAGING,
met PREMANENTDETENTION's bid around the far turn after his prior foe wilted, dug in and repelled his bidding counterpart passing the quarter pole as
MR. PETERKIN menaced, but proved no match for that foe approaching the final furlong, and was second best. PERMANENTDETENTION stalked while
tucking from the three to two path around the first turn, shifted outside of a leading COACH HUDSON into the far turn, bid approaching the five sixteenths
pole, vied turning for home, but was repelled and outkicked by an outer rival passing the quarter pole, gave way, but saved show. DOVER STRAIT tracked
from midpack while tucking from the five path to the two path around the first turn, closed in outside of the leading pair around the far turn, but was floated
four wide while getting outkicked by an inner foe entering the lane, kept on through the final furlong, but missed reaching show. XIETELEHUAS was slow
into stride and raced at the rear two wide and between horses around the first turn, improved in the four path into the far turn, but failed to threaten. EL MIC
TIESUN trailed three wide around the first turn, improved inside of foes into the far turn, chased the leaders entering the lane, but lugged inwardly after
flopping back to his left lead passing the furlong pole. YANKEE HAIL CAT broke outwardly and bounced off of RIVER'S RAGING at the start, laid off of the
pace in the three path, and never got involved. DIGNIFIED N KRAFTY raced forwardly placed in the four to three path around the first turn, but steadily
faded down the backstretch, got shuffled back behind a stopping RIVER'S RAGING at the three furlong pole, and was done early. RIVER'S RAGING took a
bump from an inner foe at the start, sparred two wide early on, failed to keep pace down the backstretch, then wilted between horses into the far turn.

Footnotes
PRAIRIE stalked outside of the clear leader, ranged up around the far turn to bid turning for home, cleared at the three sixteenths pole, and held from a
rallying rival late. MR. J. MCKAY tracked along the inside from the two path, stalked behind the leading pair around the far turn, chased entering the lane
before tipping outside of them at the three sixteenths, rallied to take aim on PRAIRIE, closed in late, but was kept at bay. FLYING FRED broke outwardly
and bothered WINDSOR ACADEMY at the start, settled off of the pace in the two path, tracked around the far turn, tipped to the four path while advancing
inside of UNORTHODOX at the quarter pole, bumped that foe in the process, then stayed on outside of that rival's entry-mate through the final furlong, and
gained show late. WAR LIGHT saved ground off of the pace, then stayed on between horses through the lane, but was denied reaching show. TENOR set a
clear pace, met PRAIRIE's bid around the far turn, but gave way at the three sixteenths pole. UNORTHODOX broke a step slowly, tracked from midpack in
the four to three path around the turns, but was bumped to the five path by an inner foe passing the quarter pole, and faded. WINDSOR ACADEMY was
bumped and bothered by an inner foe at the start, raced at the rear three wide, and never got involved. THE KUKRI raced at the rear two wide and between
horses, and was outrun.

SWEET CONFUSION stalked between a pair of foes while in the three path and just off of the leader around the turn, tipped outside of that foe entering the
lane, ranged up to bid approaching the furlong grounds, and drew off. SUPERTALEOFHOUDINI chased along the inside, secured position inside of the
faltering early pace setter into the turn, then sustained his chase along the rail through the lane, and reached an outer rival for place on the wire. THIEF OF
HEARTS vied for the lead two wide from the three path, led at the three furlong pole, but met an outer rival's bid at the furlong grounds, gave way shortly
after, and got nailed for place by an inner foe on the wire. JOANIE GAL set the pace inside of a vying THIEF OF HEARTS while staying a path off of the rail,
faded between horses passing the three furlong pole, and weakened through the lane. LETS GO ALL THEWAY saved ground at the rear of the field, but to
no avail. CAVIAR RESOLUTION raced at the rear two wide, and got outrun. STONE ARCH BRIDGE tracked while forwardly placed four wide and outside of
foes, got floated to the five path entering the lane, and weakened.

Footnotes
BOUT TIME tracked along the inside, easily slipped inside of the leaders passing the quarter pole, assumed command at the three-sixteenths, and drew off
under light hand urging through the final furlong. DYNAMITE GIFT brushed an outer foe at the start, stalked along the inside, shifted to the two path into the
turn, grinded away inside of the leader passing the quarter pole, but was outkicked by an inner bidder approaching the three sixteenths, then reached place
a sixteenth from home. QUICK MUNNY set the pace, cleared into the turn, was intentionally steered to the five path passing the quarter pole, but proved no
match for a inner rival at the three sixteenths marker, then was bested by another inner foe for place at the sixteenth pole, and saved show. FROSTERIA
bumped the inner part of the gate before being brushed by an inner rival at the start, then tracked in the four path and outside of foes around the turn,
fanned to the eight path in upper stretch, and stayed on in the final furlong, but just missed reaching show. PARKER EVA stalked in the three path around
the turn, altered to the six path in upper stretch to be outside of the pace setter once again, but lacked a kick. MA CHERIE raced at the rear along the inside,
shifted three wide entering the lane, and moved up. PLANTS AND BIRDS saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. CHOPIN DRIVE never got involved.
QUEEN CORDELIA laid off of the pace two wide, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
SECRET VISTA broke a beat slowly, tracked along the inside, shifted two to three wide while gaining turning for home, took aim on the clear leader in upper
stretch, bid at the furlong grounds while hanging on her left lead, and drove clear. C'MON VE sped clear, held sway entering the lane, but proved no match
for an outer rival at the furlong grounds, and was second best. PRIZELESS broke a step slowly, saved ground far off of the pace, gained turning for home
before altering course five wide in upper stretch, then stayed on for show while hanging on his left lead. BIG BELLA BROWN stalked the pace in the three to
two path into the turn, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the quarter pole, and chased thereafter. ZELIG laid off of the pace two wide, got floated three to
four wide at the five sixteenths pole while getting outmoved by an inner rival, and leveled off. GRACIDA was last away, trailed the field around the turn, and
passed tired rivals. DIXIE STREET was never involved. JIMMY TWO TIMES stalked from the two path, but weakened into the turn.

Footnotes
APACHE TEARS vied for the lead outside of AHIMAAZ while in the three path around the turn, led turning for home, drifted out through upper stretch, then
drew off through the final furlong. CALIFORNIA HOLIDAY saved ground while rating off of the pace, then rallied along the rail to claim place in the final
sixteenth. K C ROCKET tracked along the inside while a path off of the inner railing, reached place while shifting to the four path at the three sixteenths
pole, but flattened in the final furlong, and lost place late. BEDUIN FIGHTER laid off of the pace in the three path, fanned to the eight path in upper stretch,
and moved up between horses late. GOLDEN FLASH stalked the leading pair from the three path, floated to the nine path in upper stretch to stay outside of
the drifting leader, but lacked a kick. AHIMAAZ set the pace inside of a vying rival while in the two path around the turn, then weakened in upper stretch.
ACTION SEEKER laid off of the pace in the four path around the turn, and failed to factor. FAHAN broke a step slowly and got outrun.

Footnotes
SILLY SILLY established a clear margin early on, then held sway under driving pressure through the lane. SADIE'S PORT broke a step slowly, raced far off
of the pace in the two path, then rallied through the lane to reach outer foes for place in the final sixteenth. LAWSUIT LUCY tracked two to three wide,
chased in the four path in upper stretch, bid for place a sixteenth out, but was outkicked by an inner rival. COSMIC BELLE was reluctant to load, then broke
outwardly, stalked the clear leader from the two to three path, chased through the lane while holding place into the final furlong, but was bested by rivals on
either side in the final sixteenth. LOOKING HOT raced in midpack along the inside, but failed to threaten. SWEET JACKIELEIGH laid off of the pace two
wide, floated five wide in upper stretch, but lacked a rally. SATISFY U chased along the inside, altered four wide in upper stretch, but failed to gain. JULIA'S
CHANCE never got involved. DOUBLE APPEAL tracked three wide, but bore out turning for home, and faltered. LEGSNAHALF broke a beat slowly, and
made little impact. ABSOLUTELY MINDY also broke a step slowly, and got outrun.
