Footnotes
ROARING RIVER broke readily to race in attendance to the pace between foes in the opening quarter, was eased off the leaders conceding some ground
nearing the turn, shifted out to the four path nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance, then wrested the advantage approaching the sixteenth
marker and went clear under firm encouragement. BROADWAY PETE tracked off the first flight outside rivals in the opening stages, advanced on the
leaders three deep racing into the turn, couldn't match the winner's kick but edged a rival for the place honors late. BLAKENSTEIN was urged forcing the
pace outside rivals in the opening quarter, edged forward while shifting nearer to the inside approaching upper stretch, held sway past the furlong marker
but yielded to the top pair late. BARAHIN was hustled up inside rivals disputing the pace in the opening stages, was headed nearing the turn and gave way
racing into upper stretch. SAVVY LAYLA trailed throughout.

KILLARGUE'S GIRL was rated between foes from just out of striking distance racing to the turn, shifted out three wide in upper stretch commencing a
steady advance and took over nearing the wire to go clear under pressure. I'M A CUTIE was urged prompting a rival's pace racing in the three path into the
turn, pressed the issue into upper stretch, exchanged bumps with BLAZE AWAY N HIDE leaving the furlong marker, continued to exchange contact to the
sixteenth marker and lost momentum nearing the wire while edging his rival for the place honors. BLAZE AWAY N HIDE broke readily, was urged along the
inside setting the pace in the opening furlong, disputed the issue inside a rival into the bend, shifted out nearing midstretch making contact with I'M A
CUTIE, then continied to exchange bumps to the sixteenth marker while steadily losing momentum. MACLEAN'S BELLA ducked out slightly at the start,
was settled outside rivals in the second flight racing to the turn and offered no rally. VEGAS SLIPPERS tracked off the first flight along the inside to the turn
and steadily faded nearing upper stretch. REDZILLA angled to the inside in early stages and soon retreated. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF
BLAZE AWAY N HIDE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF I'M A CUTIE WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT
INQUIRY BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
AUBURN was rated four deep behind the leaders racing through the backstretch, shifted in nearing the turn commencing a steady advance three wide
nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage racing into the lane and moved well clear late under pressure. CRYSTAL ORB shifted inwards a bit gaining
terms with a rival prompting the pace, dueled for command between foes into upper stretch but couldn't match the winner while narrowly prevailing for the
place honors. CHARGING RENEE was rated just off the leaders between foes racing through the backstretch into the turn, shifted out four wide in late
stages and continued well enough to edge a rival for a share. FIRST GOLD was urged along the inside disputing the pace from the outset into the turn,
dueled for command into upper stretch but yielded leaving the furlong marker. CSILLA was settled between foes dropping off the second flight racing to the
turn, angled five wide racing past midstretch but lacked a rally. AUDREY settled last between foes in the opening stages and failed to menace thereafter.
RACHEL'S WISH was prompted to a contending position inside foes in the opening stages but emptied out early.

Footnotes
FANCYSOUL broke slowly dropping out last racing through the backstretch, switched outside rivals racing past the half mile marker gathering some
momentum, steadily gained position racing four wide through the turn to upper stretch, shifted inside THAWED when losing her path to that foe nearing
midstretch and continued with a steady effort to go clear under pressure, then was taken in hand once the issue was decided. THAWED broke readily,
shifted inwards to attend the the pace between foes on the backstretch, was prompted to go clear racing into the turn, bore out racing into upper stretch,
was corrected while being urged to resist the winner's bid but proved no match. C'EST PARTI settled off the second flight on the backstretch, shifted out five
wide nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to gain position to the end. ANOTHER SAUCY SIX tracked off the first flight along the inside racing
into the turn, tipped off the inside nearing upper stretch, then shifted six wide in the closing stages while continuing to improve position. PASS THE SALSA
tipped outside rivals racing just off the leaders in the opening stages, pressed the pace three wide racing into the turn and gave way between foes leaving
midstretch. LYLA'S MARK was urged inside foes disputing the pace racing to the turn and gave way after a half. BOB'S LADY tracked off the first flight
between foes on the backstretch but faded early. MARYMOTHEROF JESUS switched outside foes while racing a bit erratically in early stages, tracked the
leaders outside foes racing three deep into the turn and emptied out nearing the lane.

Footnotes
GLOVANNA raced a bit wide to the first turn dropping off the second flight, tracked the leaders from just out of striking distance three deep into the far turn,
was prompted to advance in that path racing into upper stretch to bid between foes and just wrested a narrow advantage in time to prevail. DEPUTY DORA
settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the first turn, steadily gained position racing four wide into the far turn, continued in that path between foes
into the lane and finished willingly in that path to just miss at the wire. STRONG GEM, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, switched outside
foes nearing the second bend, was caught five wide between foes racing through the far turn to upper stretch but continued willingly outside the top pair to
close the gap to the end. LUNA QUEEN, forwardly placed tracking the pacesetter in the opening half, advanced between foes entering the second bend to
press the issue through the far turn, dueled inside rivals past midstretch but yielded to the top trio late. CEFALO threw her head while being rated between
foes in the opening stages, switched outside rivals entering the backstretch commencing an early move, pressed three issue three deep racing into the far
turn, gained the advantage nearing midstretch but failed to sustain that momentum. SENSIBLE MYTH tracked off the leaders outside a rival in the opening
half and continued evenly between foes into the stretch. WORKING OVERTIME, reserved near the inside in early stages, switched off the inside on the
backstretch, was caught six wide racing through the far turn to upper stretch and had no closing response. CLEM GEM tracked the leaders along the rail
racing to the backstretch but gave way after a half. JOSEFA was urged clear along the inside racing to the backstretch, set the pace to the second bend but
gave way abruptly once headed entering the far turn.

FIREHORN tracked the leaders outside rivals in the opening stages, was prompted to advance four deep racing into the turn, shifted inwards disputing the
issue three deep into the lane and edged forward to prevail under firm right handed pressure. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY shifted off the inside to race on
terms with the leaders between foes leaving the gap, angled inside to track off the first flight racing into the turn, came through inside foes when presented
an opening in upper stretch to challenge nearest the rail in late stages but was outkicked. MR LIGHTNING BOY broke in the air while getting away well
behind the leaders, settled between foes in the last flight racing to the turn, swung out five wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance and
continued with an effort to improve position. HIGHLAND PARK HERO angled to the inside racing through the chute, then pressed the pace along the rail in
the second furlong to gain a narrow advantage, dueled inside foes into the bend and weakened between foes nearing the wire. STRIKING HEIR shifted out
three wide racing just off the first flight in the opening stages, was prompted to lodge a brief bid pressing the issue in that path racing into the turn but came
up empty in the drive. FRONTIER MESA, prominent outside foes in the opening stages, shifted inwards prompting the pace in the opening quarter, dueled
for command between foes racing into the turn, gave way early and was vanned off the course following the race. INDY RIDE angled inside tracking behind
the second flight on the backstretch, saved ground racing through the turn to the stretch but had no closing bid. MIGHTY GHOST was settled outside foes,
raced four wide into the turn and dropped out early.

Footnotes
SPIRITUAL KING was urged to the lead while angling to the rail dictating the pace on a clear margin to the backstretch, turned back a rival's challenge
leaving the far turn and went clear again in the closing stages under firm handling. DIVINE CONTROL, forwardly placed stalking the pacesetter under light
rating to the backstretch, advanced to challenge the leader racing through the far turn but proved no match in the drive. BODIE CODY angled to the rail
leaving the chute to track just behind the second flight to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, tipped out three wide racing through the stretch
and edged a rival for a share while no threat to the top pair. EVIDENCE angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, saved ground
on the far turn, shifted out racing through the stretch contesting third but was outfinished. QUINTO SOL reserved well off the leaders along the inside, saved
ground throughout and made an effort to improve position. CANDY KINGDOM settled last racing to the backstretch, switched out three deep on the far turn
and passed some tiring rivals. OUR STUIE, carried wide avoiding TIZ TRIUMPHANT while shifting into the path of GOLD CZAR racing into the first turn,
settled outside foes and never gained contention. GOLD CZAR, forced six wide racing into the first turn while being prompted to contend, continued to make
brief progress four deep on the backstretch but came up empty racing into the far turn. BIG TREASURE, forwardly placed three deep tracking the leaders to
the backstretch, steadily faded after a half. TIZ TRIUMPHANT, pulling hard against restraint between foes leaving the chute, drifted wide racing into the first
turn impeding several rivals and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
BAHAMIAN MOON was held up between foes tracking just off the leaders in the opening stages, shifted out to advance three wide between foes racing into
the turn, bid for command in that path to gain the advantage in upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm handling. FRU FRU ZAN swerved in
sharply at the start crossing the path of FAN FAN, was urged disputing the pace outside a rival, then inside foes racing into the turn, lost some position
racing into upper stretch but continued with a game effort in close quarters through the lane to prevail for the place honors late. TAPIT'S GIRL tracked off
the first flight outside foes under rating in the opening stages, was prompted to advance four wide through the turn to upper stretch, was outkicked for
second in the closing stages but narrowly prevailed for a share. BAND SWEETHEART tipped outside the leaders in the opening stages, then was urged to
press the pace outside a rival through the backstretch, dictated terms between foes a bit off the inside into the bend but failed to sustain that momentum
once headed by the winner. MS. MALEVOLENCE settled along the inside racing into the bend and failed to gain striking distance. LOVIELEE tracked just
off the first flight along the inside on the backstretch, was prompted in pursuit of the leader switching out four wide nearing upper stretch but quickly came up
empty. FAN FAN, cut off at the start, came under pressure to gain a position off the second flight outside foes on the backstretch, suffered an apparent
injury leaving the half mile marker, was quickly pulled up by his rider and was subsequently vanned off the course.
