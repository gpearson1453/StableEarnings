Footnotes
ANNAGHLASA (IRE) controlled the pace from inside, was tested by BUY AMERICAN on the far turn, cleared entering the stretch, inched away under hand
urging then tapped once with the right-handed crop inside the sixteenth pole and held safely. SUNNY MORNING (FR) was a bit fractious behind the gate,
broke slow and got pinched back at the start, settled down on the inside, went two wide into the far turn, angled out from behind runners and came three
wide into the stretch, tipped out widest at the top of the lane and put in a late run to gain the place. RHYTHM AND GRACE broke in and bothered SUNNY
MORNING (FR) at the start, tracked three wide around the first turn, chased outside a pair of rivals on the second bend, between foes with a furlong
remaining and finished evenly while moving to the inside. BUY AMERICAN raced along the inside then moved to the outside of the leader on the first turn,
was closest in pursuit in the two path, bid two wide on the far turn, could not sustain the challenge into the stretch and weakened down the lane.
TMORROWISALONGTIME stumbled a bit shortly after the start, stalked the pace outside a rival, chased two wide into the lane and lacked a late bid.
FORBIDDEN (FR) was off a bit slow and got brushed leaving the gate, stalked the pace from inside, cut the corner into the lane and had little left for the
stretch run.

Footnotes
SHUT UP MICHAEL (IRE) tracked the pace off the rail, angled in entering the turn then tipped back out with a quarter mile left to run, collared MO GOLD in
the final sixteenth and drove past. MO GOLD was off slow from inside then rushed up to take the lead, showed the way up the backstretch with company to
the outside, brushed with RIVIERA CHAMP into the turn, led clear around the bend and into the stretch, pressured by SHUT UP MICHAEL (IRE) in deep
stretch and yielded grudgingly. KO SAMUI (IRE) angled to the inside and stalked along the rail, lost his path entering the turn, remained inside to the stretch
and gained the show. TUSKEGEE CAT bobbled shortly after the start, trailed early, angled to the inside and saved ground to the lane and improved
placings. WALL STREET TRADER stalked outside the top pair, bothered by RIVIERA CHAMP coming out a bit into the turn, chased three deep around the
bend and weakened. RIVIERA CHAMP pressed the pace from outside, brushed with the leader into the turn, chased that rival between foes around the
bend, steadied off heels at the top of the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
MIKE OPERATOR was closest in pursuit to the stretch, drew alongside in upper stretch, took over at the eighth pole and drew clear, had the rider lost the
whip at the sixteenth but remained strong to the wire. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE sprinted clear early and angled to the inside, showed the way a bit off the
rail into the stretch, relinquished command with a furlong left and stayed on for the place. T BONES TRICK stumbled a bit leaving the gate, lost his path
shortly after, chased inside a pair of rivals off the rail up the backstretch, went two then three wide around the second bend, put in a mild late bid and was
along for the show. NEXT REVOLT raced in range on the inside, moved off the rail leaving the first turn, angled back to the inside around the far turn,
roused with a quarter mile left to run but lacked the needed late kick near the fence. CAMINO DE ESTRELLA lagged behind early, saved ground to the
stretch and failed to menace. SAYIN GRACE chased between rivals to the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and made no impact. THE BLACK
ALBUM (FR) tracked three deep in mid-pack, started to weaken on the far turn, trailed two wide into the lane and tired.

RENEGADE PRINCESS stalked two wide outside a rival, raced three deep briefly near the half-mile pole, closed in from inside on the second bend, headed
rival at the quarter pole and quickly took over, cleared into the stretch, met the challenge from MEDUSA'S GAZE in the lane, turned that rival away and held
gamely to the wire. AWESOME PAMELA went two wide around the first turn outside a rival, traveled near the back of the pack, between foes on the
backstretch, came three wide into the lane, moved in a bit in the stretch and got up for second. MEDUSA'S GAZE settled on the inside, moved off the rail
and ranged up three to four wide into the stretch, challenged RENEGADE PRINCESS in the drive but faltered in the final sixteenth. GLORY OF CHROME
went four then three wide on the first turn, tracked well off the rail up the backstretch, went outside rivals on the far turn then came five wide into the stretch
and finished well but outkicked by the top trio. QUEEN OF LOVE stalked on the inside, closed in around the far turn then had to wait for room behind a rival
entering the stretch, gained a clear path shortly after but flattened out. DYNAMITE QUEEN went five wide into the first turn, angled down to the three path
around the bend, was unhurried up the backstretch outside rivals, raced between foes with a quarter mile left to run, exited the bend four wide and
weakened. STOIC LUNA sent between rivals early then cleared and angled from the four path down to the two path on the first turn, jumped a shadow at
the three-quarter pole, opened up a large lead on the backstretch, started to weaken around the second bend and was collared at the quarter pole, lost
command soon after and folded in the lane. ROSES FOR MARILYN bobbled a bit at the start, raced on the inside off the pace, trailed into the stretch and
tired.

ZERO TOLERANCE forwardly placed in the early stages, bid outside late on the turn, took over at the eighth pole and lasted over the runner-up.
TAPWATER was off slow to begin, traveled along the inside off the pace, angled out on the turn, drifted inward in the drive while the rider tried to correct
course, finally straightened out under the left-handed crop, angled to the outside in the final sixteenth, surged late but missed. HEAR MY PRAYER sprinted
clear to take control early, was challenged late on the turn and into the stretch, relinquished command with a furlong remaining and was outkicked for the
place honors. GINJA chased off the inside then two wide outside a rival on the turn, offered a mild response in deep. QUIET SECRETARY raced in range
along the inside through the turn but flattened out in the furlong grounds. CONSTANTIA was off slow to begin, lacked early speed and moved to the inside,
angled out nearing the dirt crossing and could not summon the needed rally. GOLD FOR KITTEN traveled three deep off the pace early, entered the lane
three wide and came up empty.

BYE BYE BERTIE stalked off the inside, bid three deep into the far turn, took a short lead at the three-eighths, dueled around the far turn and into the
stretch, put away LA PULCINELA past the eight pole and prevailed over the runner-up. BRISTOL BAYOU went four wide into the first turn, angled down to
the two path then steered out exiting the bend, bid four deep into the second turn, lost a bit a ground and chased the top pair into the lane, came back in the
final furlong and just missed. MIDNIGHT JAMBOREE was off a bit slow to begin, angled to the two path then steered out leaving the first turn, went three
then four wide on the second bend, rallied but was not enough. LA PULCINELA dueled for the lead from inside, vied with rivals into the far turn, dueled with
BYE BYE BERTIE into the stretch, fought to midstretch and weakened late. CHOLLIMA broke a step slow, tucked inside at the back, saved ground to the
stretch and was no factor. FULL OF GRACE dueled for the lead from outside, vied between foes into the second bend, dropped back past the
five-sixteenths pole and gave way.

Footnotes
POP POP'S DREAM dropped back early and tucked inside, went between foes past the three-eighths pole, angled four wide into the stretch, overhauled
FREEDOME LASS in deep stretch and drove clear. FREEDOM LASS stalked outside a rival, raced three deep with three-eighths remaining, took aim two
wide into the stretch, bid outside in upper stretch, took over past eighth pole and yielded to the winner. JIMMYSSMOKEDCARROT settled two wide then
outside a rival, spun three wide into the lane, chased within striking distance in the drive but finished evenly late. AGREETODISAGREE rated along the
inside early, steadied entering the far turn, checked off heels at the quarter pole, angled three wide into the stretch and rallied for a minor award. UNICORN
dueled outside MISS TOKYO to the far turn, cleared with three-eighths remaining, led a bit off the rail into the stretch, was challenged in upper stretch, lost
command past the eighth pole and weakened in the final sixteenth. BESTRELLA (IRE) stalked the pace from inside, moved out and went between runners
into the far turn, was crowded and lost a bit of ground at the quarter pole, angled to the inside with a furlong left to run but could not rally. MISS TOKYO
dueled along the inside for command, lost contact with the leader at the three-eighths pole, chased from the rail position into the stretch and weakened.
PEACE PIPE got shuffled between foes early, went three wide around the first turn, exited the far turn four wide and was not a factor.
