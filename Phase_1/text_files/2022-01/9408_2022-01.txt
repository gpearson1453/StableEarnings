NOBALS rushed to the front from inside, nurtured along while well handled from the rail on the wrong lead through the stretch and held sway with a
profound performance to hold sway. DETERMINED KINGDOM inside run to turn, steadied along briefly into turn while no match for the winner. AMICABLE
dropped far back to turn with a late run for show while gaining after the fact PRIVATE ROAD pressed winner to the turn but could not keep up in the stretch.
RED LABEL bumped slightly at the start, never really a threat from the turn. TRIKITRAKI bobbled start, bore out while never far back to turn but was used
up while on empty in the final furlong. LUCKY SHOT never menaced. VIDAL sprint from gate outside, could not keep up gave way readily.

RHUBARB MARTINI had a horrendous trip from the start but managed to still get up in a gallant effort after slipping to the inside through the final sixteenth
to prevail. QUARIA THUNDER steadied back into first turn, angled out at the half to continue on with a gutsy effort to the wire. PELLETIER bumped and
squeezed back start, trailed to half, had a rough trip from the start and still salvaged the show spot. LA NEBLINA floated out very wide first turn, raced along
widest stretch run to improve position. JUSTASTAR veered out first turn, bumped, raced along in the stretch run. U SO MONEY BABY angled in sharply first
turn to rail, improved position late. DREAM STREAK tracked while three wide, widest to lead between calls, faded. TOTO'SRUBYSLIPPERS bumped rival
start, veered out 1st turn, wide run nothing left. BELLA ASTERN inside run, blocked to far turn, dropped back from that point. UP EARLY dueled from two
path thru far turn, gave way readily. TUNNEL steadied first turn, rail trip far turn, angled out sharply 1/4p. SPLIT DECISION dueled from inside to quarter
