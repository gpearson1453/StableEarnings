Footnotes
THIRTYSIX G'S dueled for the lead inside of CAEUS IN PASADENA, disposed of that foe entering the lane as GREELEY WENT WEST bid, battled with
that foe through the lane, and held gamely. GREELEY WENT WEST stalked the top two from the inside, shifted outside of them turning for home, bid
outside of THIRTYSIX G'S in upper stretch, dueled to the wire, but was denied. POWER JET trailed in the four path around the first turn, gained around the
far turn before being floated five wide turning for home, but only managed to chase the top two through the lane while proving best of the rest. CAEUS IN
PASADENA dueled for the lead two wide, but yielded between horses entering the lane, and weakened. LUCKY STREAKER stalked outside of the top pair,
chased from between horses around the far turn, then tired entering the lane. BINDING laid off of the pace while shifting outwardly to the four path around
the first turn, but came under a drive passing the half mile pole, and lacked a response before tiring.

Footnotes
BALLINONABUDJET saved ground in midpack, advanced along the rail at the five furlong pole, stalked just off the top two into the far turn, smoothly split
those foes two wide at the five sixteenths pole, then drew off at the the three-sixteenths, and widened under light urging. RANCH BADGE set the pace in the
two path, led inside of a pair of foes turning for home, but proved no match for BALLINONABUDJET at the three sixteenths pole, and was second best.
CPRIORITY prompted the pace three to two wide around the first turn while staying in the three path, but was floated three wide by an inner bidding foe at
the five sixteenths pole, and faded entering the lane. WISH UPON A STAR trailed the field, swung five wide entering the lane, and rallied willingly outside of
foes. IBEAM stalked the pace from the two path, but drifted out through upper stretch while failing to keep pace with the leaders. GREY SLOAN took the first
turn in the four path while off of the pace, and failed to factor. WE NEED A FIVE stalked two wide, chased the top trio from the four path around the far turn,
but lacked a bid before being herded outwardly approaching the final furlong, and faded. BITSY'S OTHER HALF never got involved.

Footnotes
CLUB SODA sped well clear and set a blazing pace in the three path around the turn, tired noticeably in midstretch as an inner foe attempted a bid, but held
sway safely to the wire. WILL KNOWS saved ground far off of the quick pace, rallied inside of foes through midstretch, claimed show while shifting to the
three path approaching the final sixteenth, and sustained his charge to reach place on the wire. CHAPEL BARN stalked along the inside, chased through
the lane with an attempt to produce a rail bid, but flattened out in the final furlong. LEMON AND DIEM tracked from midpack in the three path, shifted to the
five path entering the lane, and stayed on mildly. MURDO took the turn in the five path while far off of the pace, tucked down two wide entering the lane, but
failed to make an impact. THE GRAY BLUR fanned from the four path to the six path while far off of the pace entering the lane, and failed to factor.
JURISDICTION trailed around the turn, and never got involved. JACK THE RIPPER (FR) stalked two wide while in the three path around the turn, shifted to
the four path entering the lane, but tired on his left lead in upper stretch, and weakened between horses through the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
CECILITA broke a step slowly at the start and trailed the field, circled leading rivals with a four wide charge turning for home, bid outside of PORONUI at the
three-sixteenths pole sparking a duel, sparred through the final furlong, and forged an advantage in the final sixteenth. PORONUI set a clear pace in the two
path, dug in in upper stretch as CECILITA bid, battled inside of that foe through the final furlong, but was bested late. GIRLS HOUSE stalked in the three
path, then three wide around the far turn, but was outkicked by an outer rival entering the lane, and chased to secure show. SPRING MAGIC broke inwardly
at the start, stalked along the inside, but was outkicked entering the lane, lacked a bid, and faded. CHOPIN DRIVE tracked two wide and between horses,
but failed to make an impact. ZISISIT (IRE) failed to factor. HONEY RUN broke outwardly, tracked four wide around the first turn, and was done early.

was wrapped up through the late stages. MERCEDES LADIES pressed the pace three to two wide, got outkicked for place by an inner foe at the quarter
pole, but kept on, and regained that position on the wire. DELTA TRAVELER stalked along the inside, shifted two wide entering the lane, claimed place
passing the quarter pole, but was nailed by an outer foe for that position on the wire. THAT'S MY MAMA tracked three wide, got floated four wide entering
the lane, and failed to factor. FUHR MEO showed little.

I HEAR YOU stalked along the inside while in the two path, tipped outside of the leading pair at the three furlong pole, ranged up turning for home to bid
while being floated to the four path entering the lane, and assumed command passing the three-sixteenths pole. MAGICAL PEAPOD set the pace while
hugging the inner rail, but offered little resistance to a bidding I HEAR YOU at the three sixteenths pole, and was second best. APPLE DAPPLE broke
slowly, tracked four wide, then kept on in the final furlong to catch a tiring foe for show without threatening. STROLLIN THE BAYOU pressed the pace two
wide while in the three path around the first turn, but was outkicked by an outer foe entering the lane and tired in the late stages. JOY OF TREASURE got

SHORT SUMMER DRESS set the pace along the inside, inched clear of pressing rivals while in the two path passing the quarter pole, and held sway from
an inner chaser. MALLOY stalked along the inside, then chased the leader home to prove second best. HONORIFIQUE laid off of the pace early on, gained
three wide around the turn to attempt a bid entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with the pace setter passing the quarter pole, leveled off, and failed to
reach an inner foe for place. GIANNA'S GIFT pressed the pace three to two wide, but weakened in upper stretch. GREEN MONSTER pressed two wide and
between horses, but faded into the turn. READY SEEKER trailed four wide around the turn, and was outrun.

Footnotes
HANA ROAD pressed the pace three to two wide, vied around the far turn, then assumed command in upper stretch. MO NORMAL stalked along the inside
from the two path around the first turn, came into the far turn two wide, tipped outside of the leading pair entering the lane, and stayed on to prove second
best. BLOSSOM ROAD set the pace inside of a pressing HANA ROAD, vied inside of that foe around the far turn, but proved no match in upper stretch,
then tired on her left lead. YOUENS raced at the back of the pack in the five to four paths around the first turn, moved to a tracking position into the
backstretch, pressed the leading pair three wide around the far turn, but drifted back to the five path entering the lane, and faded. NOW YUS CANT LEAVE
laid off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the four path, and failed to factor. GAMBLING CAT settled off of the pace in the two path around the
first turn, advanced to an inside stalking position at the half mile pole, but only managed to chase turning for home before fading. MUCHO MACHO MOMMA
pressed the pace four to three wide, but weakened between horses approaching the half mile pole, was eased turning for home, then walked across the
wire before walking off.

Footnotes
BODOCK stalked the leading trio around the turn, split foes two wide in upper stretch to gain an advantage approaching the furlong grounds, then repelled
STRAVA's bid approaching the final sixteenth, and inched clear. STRAVA stumbled at the start, raced off of the pace two wide, swung five wide entering the
lane while commencing a rally, ranged up to bid approaching the furlong grounds as an inner BODOCK gained an advantage, but lugged inwardly from right
handed urging at that marker, and was repelled approaching the final sixteenth. LINE CHANGE pressed the pace three wide, then four wide entering the
lane, but was outkicked by rivals on either side in upper stretch, and kept on to secure show. CANDY LANDING set the pace from a pair of vying rivals
around the turn, vied inside of a quartet of foes passing the quarter pole, but yielded in upper stretch. BALADI raced at the rear along the inside, shifted to
the five path in upper stretch, but failed to factor. PESO IN MY POCKET vied for the lead two wide and between horses, then three wide passing the quarter
pole, but faded in midstretch.
