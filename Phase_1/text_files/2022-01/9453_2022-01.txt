Footnotes
FROLIC MAN applied pace pressure to PRAYIN ON CURRENCY shortly after the start, continued to force the issue into the turn, vied past the quarter pole
then shook free turning for home, came two wide into the upper stretch, widened to a clear advantage under steady pressure and stayed sharp. GOGEES
was forwardly placed inside off the top flight in early stages, tipped out three wide moving through the turn, sustained a steady bid for the leader through the
stretch run and cleared second best. TAPATERM raced off the top two flights in early stages, came under a ride around the turn, shifted out five wide in the
upper stretch, responded under a drive and closed with response. PEMBERTON chased outside in close contention up the backstretch, remained forwardly
placed around the turn, came four wide into the upper stretch, sustained bid to the furlong marker, then flattened out. SHIRLEY'S SHERMAN raced between
foes in the second flight into the turn, roused three wide into the upper stretch and failed to move on. PRAYIN ON CURRENCY cleared on top and angled
inside soon after the start, set a pressured pace through early stages, vied inside of the winner around the turn and tired in the drive. TORDO raced in the
back, saved ground around the turn and had no response.

Footnotes
MISTER KELLY sped to the lead soon after the start, widened to a clear advantage moving through the turn, roused two to three wide into the upper stretch,
responded willingly, drew off under right handed pressure and kept to task while ridden out late. SMILING TEUFLES got restless right before the break and
came away a step slow, remained in the back outside through early stages, was ridden along two wide through the turn, tipped three wide entering the
upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and dug in to captured place. FIRST RULE raced off the top two leaders and chased three wide through the turn,
tipped out wider for the drive, stayed on with response and got nipped for place. GRAINGER COUNTY was forwardly placed behind the leader in opening
stages, continued to chase after MISTER KELLY around the turn, then came up empty in the lane. PACIFIC LEGEND was not too far back in early stages,
saved ground around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
KOBLA MAS settled off the pace while racing three wide around the first turn and four wide around the far turn, closed outside and was up in deep stretch.
MO HAWK set the pace along the rail, repulsed a bid in upper stretch, re-cleared, drifted a bit in the final sixteenth and was unable to resist the winner in the
final yards. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) stalked the pace three wide, bid nearing the lane, turned for home on even terms but weakened soon after. KITTEN'S
SPA was lightly bumped at the start, raced well back two wide and rallied belatedly. ISLAND BOY saved ground well back and passed tiring rivals. TRIPLE
JEOPARDY lightly bumped with KITTEN'S SPA at the start, saved ground early, went three wide around most of the far turn, drifted very wide nearing the
lane and was not encouraged through the stretch. SURPRISE FACTOR pressed the pace two wide and retreated nearing the lane. VEGAS KITTEN chased
the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane. UNCLE FUN was outrun while racing three and four wide. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

LOVE HER LOTS advanced to contention on the far turn, challenged outside DEMOGORGON at the top of the stretch, drifted out into the final furlong and
prevailed while being bumped near the wire. DEMOGORGON vied early outside DATTTSAFANCYFOX, edged clear after six furlongs, responded when
hooked by LOVE HER LOTS turning for home, drifted out under left-hand pressure bumping her adversary in deep stretch and just missed.
VEXEDNRELAXED was four wide into the first turn before moving inward, attempted to rally inside the leading duo coming off the far turn, but could not stay
with them after straightening away and ran on clear of the others. DATTTSAFANCYFOX vied early inside DEMOGORGON, dropped back after a half-mile,
and had nothing left after six furlongs. SCENIC VIEW was five wide into the first turn, retired after six furlongs, and jogged in.

Footnotes
LIVING WATER got lightly bumped at the start and quickly advanced to take over the early lead, continued with a clear advantage entering the turn, came
two wide into the upper stretch, felt the oncoming pressure from SMOKIN BOW near the furlong marker, given cue for more, found more in reserve, turned
back bid and held firm. SMOKIN BOW got bumped at the start, tugged a bit while forwardly placed on the inside in early stages, was ridden along the rail
midway around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, remained determined in pursuit of LIVING WATER but could not reach the winner and had to settle
for second best. BRIT'S CANDYMAN raced three deep in close contention leaving the backstretch, chased three wide around the turn, weakened off the top
pair in the upper stretch and held on for show. SARAWAT raced two wide between rivals in close contention through early stages, weakened from between
past the three eighths pole, came two to three wide into the upper stretch and failed to threaten. STREET FACTS came out and bumped with SMIKIN BOW
at the start, dropped back to race in the back, failed to progress under pressure around the turn, came four wide into the upper stretch and never menaced.

DESIGNED BY KITTEN tracked the pace four wide, moved to the front in midstretch, briefly cleared and held safe. RED WIND rated off the pace three
wide, closed through the lane and just missed. DADDY'S JOY raced two wide between foes in midpack, lacked the needed rally but was along for the show.
DAY'S HUMOR set the pace along the rail to midstretch and weakened through the final furlong. MOTHERWELL hopped at the start, trailed two wide and
improved position in the lane. CAPTURINI was in range three wide and faded in the lane. TORN JEANS saved ground and failed to menace. FAST
VENEZUELA had early speed inside and retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
DOMINEER dashed clear after an alert getaway, ambled along two to three wide to the stretch, and faced no serious threats while kept busy late. KOZY
DREAMS was outsprinted early, rallied in the two-path coming off the turn, and finished willingly to best the others. FOXY LADY saved ground throughout,
gained mildly after three-eighths of a mile, but could not sustain the bid. AMERICAN OF COURSE chased outside DOMINEER to the stretch, and
weakened. FREAK saved ground and never reached contention. FRANKLY MY DEAR was outrun to the stretch three to four wide, and had the rider drop
the crop while widest and out of contention late. RAKASA chased outside for three furlongs, tired in the stretch, then suffered a catastrophic injury past the
wire.

OVER THE CHANNEL raced two wide around the first turn and settled nicely while tracking the top two leaders up the backstretch, roused forward to
challenge for the lead entering the far turn, dueled with ALLEY OOP JOHNNY late on the turn then shook free turning for home, hustled along two wide into
the upper stretch, widened to a clear advantage and stayed sharp under steady urging. DUROCHER raced two wide around the first turn and remained
unhurried in the back outside, swung five wide into the upper stretch, rallied along the outside and captured second best. HAIL TO THE CHIEF saved
ground around the first turn, angled out and settled off the early pace, responded under pressure around the far turn, came four deep into the upper stretch,
stayed on with response and got edged out late for place. STIRLING DRIVE raced inside in range up the backstretch, came under a ride two wide midway
around the far turn, sustained bid into the stretch run then yielded and finished evenly in the final sixteenth. ALLEY OOP JOHNNY stalked the pacesetter up
the backstretch, dueled for the lead around the far turn, could not move on with the winner approaching upper stretch and steadily weakened. ARCHER
ROAD rated outside of a rival in early stages, remained in range two wide around the far turn then tired in the drive. JUSTINTIMEFORWINE set the pace by
a comfortable margin up the backstretch, vied for the lead around the far turn and faded in the lane. FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE, RACE WAS HAND
