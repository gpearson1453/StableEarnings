Footnotes
PAINTBRUSH tracked outside the early leaders, took over three wide coming to the five-sixteenths, and remained clear staying on her left lead. VINTAGE
GIRL was never far back, came four wide off the turn, could not reach the winner but was much best of the others. ONLY GIRL broke slowly, improved on
the turn while shifting out five wide, and did enough to wind up a distant third. CLEVER KITTEN settled in midpack early, came three wide approaching the
stretch, and posed no threat. NADINE'S GIRL stumbled at the start, lagged far back for six furlongs, and passed tired horses. HAPPY'S NICE CANDY vied
early outside RECORD, and gave way before reaching the stretch. BITTY BABY was no factor three to four wide. MOSA MIA was widest early, came five
wide into the lane and remained well back. MUDSHAFT was always outrun. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH hesitated at the start, and faded steadily after a
half-mile. RECORD showed speed for a half, and retreated.

Footnotes
FULL SEND sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start and took the inside position, showed the way into the turn, came under pressure from ADIOS
SENIOR near the quarter pole, roused for more turning for home, responded willingly, pulled away to a commanding lead and kept to task under a strong
hand ride. EXTRACTION WILL raced in range tracking the pace from the outside, moved up into closer contention midway through the turn, launched a four
wide bid heading into the upper stretch, was no match for pulling away winner but stayed on with response and captured show in final stride. ADIOS
SENOR raced in close range of the leader in early stages and chased rival into the turn, loomed up to issue a challenge to FULL SEND near the quarter
pole, failed to be a match for pulling away winner in the upper stretch, stayed on with response and got nipped for place in final stride. THE ZIP FACTOR
bobbled at the start and quickly recovered to be off to a decent start, raced inside in range into the turn, hustled along in pursuit two to three wide into the
upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. GHOST FIGHTER raced four wide off the early pace, came under a ride around the turn, swung four to
five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. CHIEFICIA raced off the pace, was ridden along two to three wide around the turn and failed to
respond.

BLUE TIMES set the pace in the two path, shook clear nearing the lane and held clear under a mild drive. CONTROL FUNCTION prompted the winner in
the three path, could not reel in that foe but kept trying to remain clear of the rest. ASKEW trailed in the two path around the first turn, advanced outside
down the backstretch, gained three wide around the far turn and evened out in the lane. ISLA BONITA was up close inside for three-quarters and faded
through the lane. GABBY SQUARED chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. UNICORN SALLY was outrun inside.

CAJUN LOVER sprinted clear after an alert beginning, extended the advantage around the turn in the two-path, and widened through midstretch ridden out.
AWESOME CRUSADER was outrun early inside, came through between horses two wide at the top of the stretch, moved out a bit further and rallied to go
clear of the rest. UNION FREEDOM was urged along in pursuit of CAJUN LOVER three wide on the turn, made no progress but held for the show. BOUND
LUCKY was a step slow at the start, saved ground to the turn, moved out three wide into the stretch and made no headway. CONNECTING lacked room
shortly after the start, raced two wide and never factored. WILDCAT ECHO was outrun three to four wide. CASH EXPRESS was a step slow at the start,
went up to chase after CAJUN LOVER under urging, and tired after a half-mile. SHEA D CAPTURE raced four to five wide, and was through early.

Footnotes
SAYYAAF sped to the lead at the start, showed the way under some pressure from UNCLE B entering the turn, widened advantage while still unleashed
late on the turn, came under a ride turning for home, responded, kicked away to clear command and stayed sharp. COOP TRIES HARDER raced in close
contention and tracked the pace racing three wide, came under a ride late on the turn, came three wide into the upper stretch, stayed on with response and
secured second best. UNCLE B advanced out of the gate to apply some pressure to SAYYAAF in opening stages, remained forwardly positioned into the
turn, came under a ride midway around the turn, came two to three wide into the upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and cleared the rest. THE
PREDICAMENT raced off the initial speed and moved closer to the inside, roused two wide through the turn and into the upper stretch and failed to move
on. INTER MIAMI was not far back three wide entering the turn, came four wide into the upper stretch and flattened out. MILITARY DRILL raced inside in
range around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and steadily weakened. CALORIC was off slow at the start and trailed throughout.

SEABROOK SUMMER settled off the early pace between foes, advanced two wide around the turn, angled in to cut the corner into the lane, bid inside of
CHESS NOT CHECKERS in midstretch, took over near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead. QUEEN CUPID tracked the pace three and four wide, stayed
on through the lane and was up for the place late. CHESS NOT CHECKERS pressed the pace in the three path, took over near the seven-sixteenths pole,
angled into the two path soon after, vied outside of the winner through much of the lane, yielded near the sixteenth pole and lost second late between the
top two. UNBRIDLED GLITTER prompted the pace four wide and weakened in the lane. ARETE'S CHALICE was in range while racing four and five and
tired in the drive. JUANITA R was outrun while saving ground around the turn and angling four wide turning for home. TOUCH OF LOVE hopped at the start
and was never close while racing four and five wide. HARD CHOICE set the pace in the two path and stopped after a half.

Footnotes
DRINKS ON ME broke alertly, stayed in range three then four wide to the stretch, rallied determinedly and wore down OPEONGO from outside in the
closing yards. OPEONGO sprinted to the front with a sharp start, showed the way in the two-path, remained clear into the final furlong but could not hold on.
VEIL was outrun early, found her best stride in the two-path through midstretch and was up for the show. ALIZEE broke a step slow, then bobbled a stride
out, raced well back early, came six wide for the drive and improved for the last major share. HEART OF GOD came in after the start forcing BEAUTY
QUEEN inward, and raced evenly four to five wide. NOBLE INTENTIONS got bumped into CANARSIE ANGEL by BEAUTY QUEEN soon after the start and
steadied back, trailed to the stretch, and passed tires horses. MIDSHIP LADY saved ground to no avail. CANARSIE ANGEL was bumped by NOBLE
INTENTIONS shortly after the start, and never reached contention. LIZA STAR chased outside OPEONGO to the stretch, and tired. MS BIG SPRING was
forwardly placed inside for three furlongs, and tired. BEAUTY QUEEN was herded into NOBLE INTENTIONS by HEART OF GOD early, and was outrun
four to five wide.

Footnotes
MILES AHEAD was forwardly placed up the inside in early stages, tipped three wide and advanced to issue a challenge late on the turn, came three wide
into the upper stretch, took over the lead from DOC AMSTER, widened advantage under a mild drive and finished in hand. DOC AMSTER raced in
contention off the top two leaders in early stages, roused forward three wide entering the turn, led the way turning for home, got collared by MILES AHEAD
in the upper stretch, stayed on with response and finished clearly second best. SENOR JOBIM was not far back outside through early stages, headed in
pursuit three wide mid-way through the turn, roused forward into close contention late on the turn, came four wide into the upper stretch, weakened off the
top two leaders and stayed on for show. GANGLY raced inside in range in early stages, tipped out late on the turn, was ridden along five wide into the upper
stretch and needed more for late impact. LAVERY lacked speed and raced in the back, swung wide into the stretch run and failed to kick on. VINNIE VAN
GO led the sway out of the gate, showed the way into the turn then got collared by DOC AMSTER past the three eighths pole, continued forwardly placed
around the turn then retreated at the head of the lane.

pole, drew clear leaving the eighth pole and held safe under a drive. ONENIGHTSTANDARDS tracked the pace from the rail around the first two turns and
in the two path around the far turn, tipped three wide in upper stretch and was gaining on the winner late. JARREAU prompted the pace two wide, bid
between foes nearing the quarter pole but was outkicked in the lane. LANDBISCUIT set the pace along the rail and weakened in the lane. CONQUER THE
WORLD chased the pace three wide and had no response around the far turn. ROYALE raced off the pace three wide, angled in nearing the far turn and
retreated.

Footnotes
SUMMER BEAUTY pressed the early pace, took over three wide around the turn, and remained in command under a drive. ELUSIVE UNCAPTURED raced
behind the first flight entering the turn, came three wide rallying into second approaching the stretch, ran on willingly but could not menace the winner.
LATTE LOVER turned in an even effort racing three to four wide. BET ON DRAMA was slowest away, raced toward the rear three wide to the stretch, and
offered a mild response to get a share. CERTAIN HEARTS raced four then three wide around the turn, and posed no threat. SENORITA SALSA raced two
wide on the turn, cut the corner with a mild run into the stretch, then gave way a furlong out. CRYSTAL LAGOON was difficult to load, raced four to five
wide, and tired after three furlongs. BORDEAUX LEGACY showed early speed inside, and was through before reaching the stretch. RED PRIESTESS vied
early two wide, moved inside yielding to the winner past the midway point on the turn, and folded up. FIVE K KITTEN was finished early inside.
