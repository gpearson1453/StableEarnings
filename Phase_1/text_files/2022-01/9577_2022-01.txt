Footnotes
SARAHS HOME raced within contention, came around the turn four wide, drove clear down the lane and won under steady urging. JUS MY IMAGINATION
broke poorly, racing near the back, moved up on the outside around the turn, rallied down the lane and finished willingly. SHESTHECATSMEOW vied for
the early lead, saved ground around the turn, forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for the top two. KELLYS THE BOSS lacked early speed,
came around the turn wide, showed late interest, but was no factor. LIL' SISTER LOU challenged for the early advantage and weakened. STOP THE
FRIEND raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. RIVETRIX raced near the back, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.
CHICKEN OR THE EGG always raced near the back, came around the turn wide and was no threat. QUEEN BINDALA flashed early speed and dropped
back.

Footnotes
CABOT TRAIL pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, made a late bid and got up in time. GETALOADOFTHIS sprinted to the front, drove clear and
was caught at the wire. BAPTISM was an early factor, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late kick. ONEHOLYLION raced near the middle of the
field, came around the turn on the outside, made a wide gain, but was no real threat. TROY OUNCE raced within contention, saved ground around the turn
and finished evenly. FREUDIAN SIP raced in the middle of the field, put forth an even effort and lacked a bid. FIRE BLASTER void of early speed, came
around the turn on the outside, finished wide and was never a threat. SPREAD THE FAITH lacked early speed and showed little. BLACK JUSTICE always
raced near the back and was outrun.

Footnotes
QUESTION AUTHORITY pressed the pace, moved up on the outside around the final turn, pulled away and won handily. LIAM SKYE unhurried in the
beginning, came around the final turn wide, made a bid down the lane, proved no match for the winner, but held on for place. TEXAS RULE void of early
speed, made a late gain, racing wide and was outfinished for second. SOURNOIS raced within contention, saved ground around the second turn, put forth
an even effort and lacked a late kick. INCA WARRIOR raced in the middle of the field, put forth an even effort and was no real factor. POPPI IS SMILING
raced in the back of the pack, had a wide trip, moved up, but was no factor. MR. PAYCHECK vied for the early advantage, saved ground around the second
turn and faded. HOT TEN lacked early speed and showed little. STONE SECRET dueled on the front end in the early part, dropped back and was eased to
the wire.
