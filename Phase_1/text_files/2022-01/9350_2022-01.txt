NATIVE HAWK switched off the inside in early stages tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance racing to the turn, steadily advanced three wide
on the bend to close the gap, took over nearing midstretch and went clear under firm encouragement. MYSTERY MAN tracked the leaders just inside the
eventual winner on the backstretch, tipped outside foes racing into upper stretch and proved best of the others in the drive. LITIGANT, urged inside a rival
disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, switched outside that foe racing into upper stretch and edged her for a share while no match for the top pair.
CREEKMORE was urged forcing the pace outside a rival on the backstretch, edged forward nearing upper stretch while angling to the inside but faltered
leaving midstretch. NICE OF ME settled outside rivals racing to the turn and offered no rally.

Footnotes
SPEEDY ENOUGH broke readily, raced three deep tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening stages, shifted inwards nearing the bend while advancing
on the pacesetter between foes, wrested a narrow advantage nearing midstretch, then continued with a steady late response to hold safe the challenge of
FOLK HERO to the end under firm right handed encouragement. The latter raced unhurried in the opening stages settling off the second flight, shifted out
four wide nearing the turn while being prompted to advance, continued with a solid response to close the gap on the winner leaving midstretch but failed to
gain even terms. BLUSHING KEYLEN swerved out sharply at the start, was quickly righted, then hustled to the lead while angling sharply to the rail after the
opening furlong, dictated the pace into the turn, briefly resisted the winner's bid but gave way leaving the furlong marker. FALL CAMPAIGN shied outwards
avoiding BLUSHING KEYLAN at the start, was collected to track just off the second flight, was urged three wide into the turn pursuing the leaders through
the bend but came up empty in the drive. MILL LAKE LADY tracked just off the pacesetter between foes in the opening stages and steadily faded nearing
the lane. SCOOP THERE IT IS, urged to a forward placing along the rail, tracked just off the pacesetter inside foes in the second furlong while steadying
then altering course outside the leader and soon dropped out.

ASTERS D'ORO was hustled to gain the lead racing a bit off the rail in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the turn, shifted out to
the three path racing into upper stretch and steadily widened her advantage under firm encouragement. KIZZY worked her way to the inside tracking just off
the pacesetter nearing the turn, was roused to advance inside foes nearing upper stretch and proved best of the others. BET ON DRAMA, forwardly placed
three wide in the opening stages, continued in pursuit of the pacesetter in that path between foes racing into the turn, couldn't match terms with the top pair
in upper stretch and faded in late stages while prevailing for a share. RANSOMS REWARD tracked the leaders between foes racing into the bend and
continued evenly into the stretch while missing for a share. ADRIANA ES BONITA, off a bit slowly, was switched out four wide approaching the turn, was
urged to lodge brief bid in that path midway through the bend but soon flattened out. MATCHA tracked the leaders along the inside in the opening stages
but faded early.

Footnotes
BOURBON WISDOM, forwardly placed between foes racing into the first turn, switched outside the pacesetter racing into the backstretch continuing with a
steady bid, pressed the issue on the far turn, took over racing into upper stretch and kicked well clear under firm encouragement. THANK YOU, knocked
back by MINNESOTA LUCKY at the start, was settled last dropping well off the field, gradually gained terms with the field while switching outside foes on
the far turn, was fanned six wide racing into upper stretch but continued with interest to gain the place honors in the closing stages. END ALL GET ALL,
reserved well off the leaders while angling to the rail racing to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, then tipped out racing through the stretch
to gain some position between foes while gaining a share. AYCAPOTE raced three wide between foes in tough with the leaders racing to the first turn,
dropped back to track off the second flight on the backstretch, was prompted to advance three, then four wide nearing the lane but had no closing bid.
MITZRAYIM, bumped at the start, settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, angled five wide racing into the stretch but offered no rally. MINNESOTA
LUCKY ducked inwards at the start bumping THANK YOU soundly forcing that rival into MITZRAYIM, was righted, then hustled four wide into the first turn
challenging for command, went clear into the backstretch to dictate the pace along the inside to the far turn but gave out once headed by the winner .
NIETZSCHE, urged to a forward placing along the inside, steadily faded racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
SUMMER ASSAULT, reserved outside a rival in the last flight racing to the first turn, shifted out four wide nearing the second bend while gradually gaining
position, advanced four wide through the far turn to gain terms with the leaders in upper stretch, wrested the advantage leaving the furlong marker and held
BLUE SKY KOWBOY on a narrow margin to the end under firm handling. The latter was held up out of close quarters at the start, then angled to the rail
racing through the chute, saved ground in last racing to the far turn, swung out five wide while being roused to advance racing into upper stretch, loomed
outside the winner nearing the sixteenth marker but couldn't match that rival's kick while prevailing for the place honors. GROUNDED broke readily, dictated
the pace on a narrow advantage along the inside, dueled for command through the far turn into upper stretch, was headed nearing the furlong marker but
kept on contesting the issue grudgingly while just failing to contain the top pair. BRAMBLE QUEEN angled to the rail racing to the first turn tracking just off
the leaders, saved ground through the far turn to upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. DRAMA CHORUS was firmly rated stalking just outside the
pacesetter in the opening five furlongs, advanced to press the issue nearing upper stretch, struck the front racing past the furlong marker but gave out
abruptly in the closing stages. CAROM was rated off the second flight racing to the backstretch, came under pressure to advance between foes racing
through the far turn but had no closing bid. A THREAD OF BLUE tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half, shifted three deep while being
urged to lodge a brief bid between foes on the far turn but soon emptied out.

Footnotes
MY WAY OR NO WAY bumped soundly at the start by PELLEGRINI, was righted, then switched outside foes in the opening stages to track the leaders in
second flight, shifted inwards racing into the bend while steadily gaining position, angled out three wide in upper stretch and produced a stout rally to wrest
the advantage leaving the sixteenth marker, then go clear under firm encouragement. DOUBLE WARRIOR was hustled clear of the field while angling to the
inside racing through the backstretch, held sway past midstretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. CHROME'S RIGHT swerved out
sharply at the start, was settled into stride dropping well off the leaders on the backstretch, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch and displayed
some belated interest while gaining a share. PELLEGRINI broke outwards bumping the eventual winner soundly at the start, was righted to track the leaders
between foes racing to the turn, steadily faded nearing the lane and drifted well wide in the closing stages. WOOTDAREITIS broke readily, was urged
pursuing the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn and gave out midstretch. HEAVY WEIGHT, off slowly, came under prompting in the opening
stages along the inside to gain a position inside foes tracking just off the leaders but was spent early. THUNDER ROLLED dropped out of contention early,
was soon outdistanced, then walked off the course under his own power.

Footnotes
VIOLENT FIGHT angled to the inside leaving the chute to track behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, gained some position inside foes after a
half, switched off the inside splitting rivals on the far turn, shifted out three wide racing into the stretch and continued with a steady gain between foes to
strike the front in time, narrowly prevailing under firm encouragement. VAN, off slowly, settled last to the first turn, switched out entering the backstretch
pulling his way three deep between foes after a half, shifted out four wide leaving the midway point of the far turn and continued willingly in that path to the
end while just failing to collar the winner. SILENT SONATA, off a step slowly while losing his path to PALIZA at the start, shifted inwards while settling
between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while angling to the inside racing into the far turn, tipped out two wide,
then three deep between foes through the closing stages but continued to advance while caught in tight quarters nearing the wire. COCHISE CHARLIE
tracked off the first flight along the inside leaving the chute, was held up momentarily when avoiding traffic entering the first turn, shifted out three wide after
a half while being prompted to advance, moved to challenge in that path nearing upper stretch, struck the front midstretch but yielded to the top trio leaving
the sixteenth marker. ESTILO VARONIL in touch prompting the pacesetter along the inside racing through the chute, was rated just off that rival along the
inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, shifted off the inside nearing midstretch
avoiding some tiring rivals but lacked the needed late kick while finishing on his own courage. WESTWARD LOOK broke readily, was urged along the inside
dictating the pace to the far turn, dueled for command inside foes into the stretch and gave way leaving the furlong marker. NOT INVENTED HERE,
reserved while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch but offered no rally. PALIZA
popped the gate just before the field departed the starting stalls while ducking inwards, then bobbling, was prompted to join the first flight five wide racing
through the chute, shifted inwards sharply racing into the first turn while crossing the path of ROLL ON DUDE to gain terms with the pacesetter, raced just
off the leader to the backstretch prompting that foe to the second bend but emptied out nearing upper stretch. UNIMPEACHED raced four deep between
foes through the chute, was steadied while being carried wide avoiding ROLL ON DUDE racing into the first turn, continued outside rivals into the
backstretch and dropped out early. ROLL ON DUDE broke readily, raced between foes just off the pacesetter under light rating leaving the chute, clipped
heels with PALIZA while being checked off that rival racing into the turn, switched out four wide racing to the backstretch while under some prompting to
maintain contention and abruptly gave way racing into the far turn. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE
INCIDENT ON THE FIRST TURN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
ESTILO DIFERENTE, a bit restless loading in the gate, gained a position tracking off the first flight four wide on the backstretch, was prompted to advance
three deep nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage approaching the furlong marker and edged clear under pressure. MAARTY'S DILEMMA broke
slowly while swerving sharply to the outside, settled outside foes racing widest to the turn, was fanned six wide racing into upper stretch and found her best
stride in the closing stages to close the gap on the winner. BEAUTIFUL ROSALIA was rated off the second flight outside foes in the opening stages, was
fanned five wide between foes racing into upper stretch but continued with late interest to close the gap on the leaders while edging a rival for a share on the
wire. WITHOUT A VIEW was settled outside foes in the opening quarter, was prompted to advance four wide through the turn to upper stretch but lacked
the needed final kick. BRASS BAND was urged to gain the lead while angling to the inside, dictated the pace under light rating to the turn, dueled inside
rivals into upper stretch and gave way leaving the furlong marker. NIGHTMIDST, bumped, then squeezed back at the start, was collected, then urged
between foes to gain some position in the second flight racing into the turn but steadily faded in the drive. OUR ELECTRA GUITAR tracked off the first flight
along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch and faded in the drive. BELLE GOSSE tracked off the second flight inside racing to the turn but failed to
menace. DURA THE EXPLORER, very reluctant when loading in the starting gate, broke outwards bumping NIGHTMIDST and dropped back early.
BALLYMENA was urged to terms prompting a rival's pace on the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes on the turn to strike the front nearing the lane
but gave out abruptly leaving the furlong marker.

Footnotes
HOITY TOITY angled to the rail racing through the chute tracking just off the leaders, continued under light rating along the inside to the far turn, came
through inside foes to bid for command nearest the rail when presented an opening and responded to firm handling to edge forward to a clear advantage
nearing the wire. BEAN COUNTER tracked just off the first flight outside the eventual winner racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced on the pacesetter
three deep on the far turn, moved to gain the advantage in that path midstretch but was outkicked. POSTINO'S IDOL was urged to the lead while angling to
the rail racing through the chute, dictated the pace along the inside on a narrow advantage to the far turn, dueled inside foes while shifting off the rail racing
into upper stretch, resisted the top pair past midstretch but weakened late. KITTEN WITH A WHIP settled outside foes in the opening stages, shifted
inwards on the backstretch pulling her way between foes gaining position racing into the second bend, shifted outside a tiring foe to race four wide nearing
upper stretch and continued in that path to the end while making a mild gain. GO YEOWOMEN angled to the inside tracking off the second flight in the
opening half, shifted out three wide in upper stretch and continued evenly between foes late. SHE FLED THE SCENE, reserved between foes racing to the
first turn, switched outside foes to race four wide on the backstretch, was prompted to advance while being fanned five wide nearing the lane and had no
further late response. NOT ORBINARY, off slowly, was settled last along the inside racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. MORGAN'S Z VA,
forwardly placed attending a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, was urged to maintain that position racing into the far turn but gave way between foes
into the lane. LIL HOOH'S HOOH was settled between foes racing to the backstretch and lacked a response when called upon to advance.
