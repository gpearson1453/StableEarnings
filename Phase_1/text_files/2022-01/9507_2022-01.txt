Footnotes
K. C. CHIEF chased the pacesetter from a distance for a half-mile, closed in rapidly from outside entering the far turn, reached a short lead after six furlongs
and moved inward, and dug in through the stretch while remaining on his left lead. DOCTOR NASH swung four wide approaching the stretch, finished
willingly between horses and edged CALIFORNIA FROLIC for the place after brushing lightly with that one. CALIFORNIA FROLIC lagged far back for a half,
fanned five wide into the lane, rallied outside brushing lightly with DOCTOR NASH and lost the place in a head bob. SUN VIKING chased outside K. C.
CHIEF to the far turn, challenged for command approaching the stretch, weakened through the last sixteenth of a mile and was outkicked for larger shares.
TANG saved ground early, raced two wide on the far turn and could not gain under pressure. PETER D was never in the hunt. AFIKOMAN was never
prominent outside. ANGELUS DIAMOND sped off early while well removed from the inside, and stopped after six furlongs.

Footnotes
NO DRAMA stalked the pace two wide, took over nearing the head of the lane, continued on the left lead, kicked clear in upper stretch and lasted under a
steady drive. WARN lacked early speed while racing two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, closed outside and just missed. EL PECADO
stalked the pace three wide, had aim outside of the winner turning for home and was outkicked between the top two. ASCENDING MOON set the pace
along the rail, was collared nearing the stretch and weakened. I GEN failed to menace while racing two wide. CROWN OF HONOR trailed inside, had no
response when roused around the far turn and was easing through the lane.

Footnotes
HIGH FAIR was away in good order and settled while rated inside through early stages, remained patiently handled around the turn, tipped out two wide
approaching the top of the stretch, quickly shifted back to the inside and headed in pursuit, vied for the lead past the furlong marker then drew clear under
strong handling. JAZLA was not too far back in early stages, hustled up three wide around the turn, swung five wide into the upper stretch, gathered
momentum under steady pressure and got up late to take place. HONOR THAT applied pace pressure to SHAWNEE PRINCESS from the onset, moved up
midway around the turn and matched strides for the lead, battled on past the furlong marker then lacked closing response and lost place. SHAWNEE
PRINCESS set a pressured pace over HONOR THAT through early stages, vied for the lead mid-way around the turn, fought back into the final furlong then
gave way. TESTIMONIAL was forwardly placed inside soon after the start, weakened off the frontend and hustled up two wide around the turn, came out
wider into the drive and faded. SUNDAY SUZANNE raced in the back, saved ground around the turn and had no response. EVELYN slightly bobbled at the
start, raced in contention along the outside in early stages, hustled up three wide to race in close contention at the quarter pole, failed to sustain bid out of
the turn and faltered through the lane.

FIFTH ANNIVERSARY tracked outside the leaders three wide early, challenged outside BABY'S DIALED IN turning for home, took over entering the final
furlong and drew off. BALI DEL SOL was outsprinted for three-eighths of a mile, shifted widest into the lane and rallied with good energy while never a threat
to the winner. BABY'S DIALED IN set the pace inside to midstretch, and gave way. LI LI BEAR pressed the early pace between horses, and faded steadily
through the stretch. MAJESTIC D'ORO was three wide and urged along behind the leading trio on the turn, and came up empty. RIGBY saved ground
throughout, and was finished early.

Footnotes
MY PHILLY TWIRL set the pace along the rail, shook clear in upper stretch and widened under left-handed urging. LADY PUCHI raced off the pace two
wide, angled four wide in upper stretch, continued on the left lead to deep stretch and rallied for the place. ULTIMA COPA broke a bit awkwardly, raced off
the pace two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, came five wide into the lane and was up for the show. PHAROAH'S SONG saved ground in
range, went three wide between foes around the far turn and went evenly. GOLDEN EFFECT saved ground behind the pacesetters, checked when getting
rank late on the first turn, remained up close inside around the far turn, moved into second inside of foes in upper stretch but weakened through the final
furlong. INES'S HATS pressed the winner two wide to upper stretch and tired. AMAGE chased the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane.
FREDERICIA failed to menace while racing three wide. LEMON RED was outrun inside. SOUL OF AN ANGEL checked not long after the start, saved
ground and was never involved. YANKEE CHRISTMAS steadied along through the opening furlong, saved ground and made little impact. THIS RACE WAS
HAND TIMED WITH FRACTIONS AND RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
RACE DAY SPEED was well rated while never too far back along the outside, edged up closer moving through the turn, roused forward four wide at the
head of the lane, roused forward to duel for the lead, gained a slight edge at the furlong marker then widened to a clear advantage and held firm.
CELESTIAL CHEETAH was allowed to settle three wide just off the early pace, continued patiently ridden around the turn, shifted out to race five paths wide
in the upper stretch, closed willingly along the outside and gained to the wire. TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR was forwardly placed in striking distance of the top pair
in early stages, moved up to challenge midway around the turn, dueled for the lead into the stretch run, could not move on with the winner past the furlong
marker but stayed on with response and secured show. TIZ ENOUGH came away last and angled to the rail soon after the start, continued reserved in the
back although never too far from the frontend, shifted out leaving the turn, came six paths wide into the upper stretch and improved position without
threatening. PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL vied for the lead racing outside of STARSHIP NANA in opening stages, dueled between rivals around the turn, fought
back past the furlong marker then gave way. STARSHIP NANA vied for the early lead racing inside of PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL, dueled between foes around
the turn, fought back to the furlong marker then came up empty and steadily faded.

ODRAMARK broke to the lead, set a slow pace in the two-path to the stretch, and was under mild hand urging to the finish. FLYING BLACK raced close up
inside to the stretch, moved off the rail leaving the furlong grounds and finished well to best the rest. BAYOU BELLE prompted the pace from outside to the
stretch, and could not gain late. ISADORABLE AIDA raced close up three wide to the stretch, and had no rally. MIDNIGHT BELLA bumped a couple times
with ON A TOUR leaving the gate, and posed no threat widest throughout. ON A TOUR exchanged bumps with MIDNIGHT BELLA at the start, raced three
wide and never menaced. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN raced two wide on the turns, and had no final rally inside. PLAYERA made no impact two wide.
CURRENT SITUATION saved ground and never factored.

LUCCI vied two wide early, cleared and angled to the rail entering the turn, set the pace inside from there, was headed in upper stretch then kicked clear
under a drive. CLASSICSTATEOFMIND vied inside of the winner down the backstretch, angled two wide when that foe cleared entering the turn, re-bid two
wide turning for home, took a brief lead in upper stretch but was no match through the final furlong. TOPS THE CHART lacked speed while saving ground,
tipped two wide near the quarter pole and ran on to gain the show. HOPE IN HIM chased the top two in the clear in the two path and weakened in the lane.

SHOOTLIKEAGIRL sat just off the pressured pace in early stages, circled up four wide to threaten the leaders late on the turn, roused forward to challenge
R GIRL'S WERTH IT in deep stretch and prevailed under a driving finish. R GIRL'S WERTH IT sped to a slim lead out of the gate, vied for the top spot into
the turn, saved ground turning for home, shook free under pressure in the upper stretch, fought back when challenged by SHOOTITLIKEAGIRL in deep
stretch and got denied in final strides. DEVILLY raced two wide between foes entering the turn, raced in traffic at the head of the lane, shifted out for a clear
path, responded under pressure and closed with response. MANDORLA forced the pace in opening stages, dueled for the lead between foes around the
turn, could not move on with R GIRLS WORTH IT at the head of the lane, sustained bid into the final furlong then evened out. BULLET ON TAP raced up
close outside through early stages, edged up and dueled three deep around the turn, sustained bid past mid-stretch then flattened out. CALL ME PENNY
raced inside not far back into the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and steadily weakened. GATE CLOSURE was off slow at the start, remained
reserved in the back, came four wide into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally.
