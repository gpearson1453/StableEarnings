Footnotes
FLOWER MOON coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, advanced through the turn to take over command nearing the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, edged away under a drive kept to task. WICKED HAPPY bobbled at the break, chased three wide under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued three wide for home, ran on to chase the winner home well clear of the rest and along second best.
SUPERBLOODWOLFMOON stumbled at the start and recovered inwards bumping GAILHORSEWIND, then got taken in hand as MY DELICIOUS came
inwards, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five
wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. GAILHORSEWIND got bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe who recovered
inwards from a stumble, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and offered no response. MY DELICIOUS
broke in at the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
SOUPSTER hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing midway on the turn under pressure and relented nearing
the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
BROCKMONINOFF was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked coming to the
quarter-pole, shook clear into upper stretch, responded well under a right-handed crop in the final furlong and held under strong urging. SCORPION
DYNASTY was hustled from the start, chased the pace on the outside then in the four path on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop, pursued the
winner in the drive and finished willingly for the place. LITTERBOX was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was given his cue outside
the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved out into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while just able to get the show. MR
FANTASY pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch and was out-kicked. MAJESTIC
TIGER bumped with a foe just after the start, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the three path, came into upper stretch under a drive
and failed to rally. I'M BLAMING YOU bumped with an opponent just after the start then was in tight, raced on the outside while ridden along, went five wide
on the turn and lacked the needed response. BLACK IRISH was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
GHOSTMON five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung four
wide for home, dug in under a drive threatening through the final furlong and steadily gaining to get up in the final jumps and prevail. BOOM BOOM
KABOOM four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn getting placed to coaxing near the five-sixteenths, took the inside
route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive taking command just inside the eighth pole and was caught in the final strides to the wire. TAMBURRO'S SOX
pressed the pace of DATA DEAL from the outside three then two wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home,
seized command at the three-sixteenths, dug in under threat and was headed just inside the eighth pole, ran on well clear of the rest for the show honors.
SONIC SPEED six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide
into upper stretch and weakened. SIR WILLIAM hustled from the gate, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the
turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. DATA DEAL showed the way in hand just off the inside
under pressure from TAMBURRO'S SOX to the outside, tucked inside through the turn and was coaxed along from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside
for home under threat from a flanking pair, yielded near the three-sixteenths marker and weakened. HARDLY WORKING four then three wide in pursuit,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired. REMEMBERMOM lunged at the start to the right side striking the gate and
lost the rider in the process, then got apprehended by outrider following the finish and walked off under his own power. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into
the start focusing on REMEMBERMOM prior to the result standing and the race being declared official.

Footnotes
MISS PEPPINA disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied inside to the two path on the turn, lost the lead to the runner-up in upper stretch, was carried
out badly by that foe started outside the furlong marker, kept on in pursuit to the wire and got up to prevail. CHARLOTTE WEBLEY was well placed just off
the pace, dropped to the inside early on the turn then drafted behind the leaders, squeezed through along the rail to make a bid into upper stretch then took
the lead, began to drift out outside the furlong marker then was put to a left-handed crop shortly thereafter, drifted out badly under a continued left-handed
crop and bothered several foes, was straightened near the sixteenth-pole then switched to a right-handed crop late and denied on the wire while just able to
hold second. ADDILYN was hustled from the gate, settled off the pace, moved from the rail to the three path under urging on the turn, came four wide into
upper stretch under a drive, was forced out near the furlong marker, bumped with a foe then steadied at that point, gained into the final sixteenth and just
missed while clear for the show. MEBS WEB settled off the pace, was roused four then five wide on the turn, raced under a drive late on that bend, was
forced out near the furlong marker then bumped with a foe, moved in late and lacked the needed kick. AWESOMENEWYEAR contested the pace on the
outside then in the three path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and capitulated. DAZZLING SPEED broke a bit slow, moved up on the outside to
stalk the leading duo under tight restraint, rounded the turn in the four to five path, was let out then asked at the five-sixteenths, floated six wide into the
stretch, was forced out while dropping back inside the furlong marker and had nothing left. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND A JOCKEY CLAIM
OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF ADDILYN, CHARLOTTE WEBLEY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED LAST FOR INTERFERENCE IN
THE STRETCH.

three wide on the turn and secured the place while no match for the winner. IRISH GIANT was slowest into stride, settled at the rear, moved from three to
five wide under urging on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was along for the show. OUR AMERICAN STAR was ridden along on the outside,
went four then five wide on the turn and failed to threaten. QUINTARELLI chased the pace on the outside then in the two to three path on the turn and tired.

turn and came up empty. EXXTOP was bumped lightly near the five-eighths pole, went around the turn in the two path and capitulated.

Footnotes
WAXMAN coaxed from the gate, raced three then two wide through the first turn before tipping to the five path down the backstretch, steadily gained joining
a pair just in behind the leader nearing the far turn, continued four wide through that bend coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went four wide into
upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, edged away under a drive kept to task to the finish. WINTER POOL three wide through the
first turn, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to be along
clear of the rest for the place honors. SOUTHERN DISTRICT got bumped lightly at he start by KING KUMBALAY due to pressure from NO BURN, chased
along the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and nudged with DUST DEVIL straightened away, then
improved position to secure the show honors. DUST DEVIL just off the inside through the opening bend, chased six paths off the inside down the
backstretch before tucking four to five wide through the turn, went six wide into upper stretch and traded a nudge with SOUTHERN DISTRICT straightened
away, then passed tired rivals to the finish. NO BURN hustled from the gate, bumped KING KUMBALAY three times while under hustling to establish the
front, showed the way along the inside through the first turn under some pressure from a pair to the outside, tipped to the two path down the backstretch and
settled into a comfortable rhythm, came under increased pressure into the far turn as TOP GUN TOMMY advanced to knock heads into that bend, shook off
that rival near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside for home confronted by the eventual winner, got displaced from command inside the
three-sixteenths and weakened to the wire. AUBURN HILLS forwardly placed three wide through the first turn, raced four then three wide in aim of the
leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went three wide into upper stretch and tired. KING KUMBALAY got bumped thrice at the start as NO
BURN came out under hustling and in turn bumped SOUTHERN DISTRICT when bumped for the last time, chased along the inside, came under coaxing
just off the inside three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. TOP GUN TOMMY just off the inside
through the first turn prompting the leader from the outside, went three wide down the backstretch and advanced into the far turn to duel with NO BURN now
tucked to the two path and placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, got shaken off with five-sixteenths to go and cornered just off the inside into upper
stretch, then faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
BARESE settled on the outside, was roused five wide on the turn, rallied outside in upper stretch, closed strongly to get the lead inside the furlong marker
then drew clear under good handling. AGILITY settled just off the pace on the outside, was urged four wide on the turn, pursued the leader into the final
furlong, lugged in late and narrowly earned the place. DAUFUSKIE ISLAND was hustled from the start, chased the pace on the outside, went three wide on
the turn, pursued the leader while still on his inside lead in the stretch, vied between foes late and just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show.
UNIQUE UNIONS was hustled to the front, went around the turn in the two path, led under a drive into the final furlong and was overtaken then lost the
trifecta. CUT THE CORD was slowest into stride and last to commence, raced towards the back under urging, went two to three wide on the turn, was
driven six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY dropped well behind the rest of the field, went two to three wide on the turn,
came seven wide into the stretch and gained but missed the suiperfecta. G MUNNING settled off the pace, was taken in hand near the nine-sixteenths,
remained under some restraint into the turn, was asked while two to three wide on that bend and came up empty. ALWAYS CHARMING lacked speed while
urged along, raced inside to the two path on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch then moved further out and lacked the needed response. BALI'S
SHADE was well spotted just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, dropped back under urging into upper stretch and faltered.

HOT STEPPER coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three then
two wide into upper stretch straightened away, angled to the rail and rallied up the inside in tandem with CLASH A. J., to his outside, engaged the embattled
top pair near the sixteenth marker trading bumps with that rival as the pair threaded a seam not quite sufficient enough for both of them inside of RAW
COURAGE and was up in the final jumps to the wire. CLASH A. J. five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four then three wide through
the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, rallied in concert with HOT STEPPER to his inside to confront the embattled
top duo with a sixteenth to go, split foes inside that station trading bumps with HOT STEPPER jostling for a seam between that rival and RAW COURAGE
and missed at the end in a good effort in a blanket finish. RAW COURAGE hustled from the gate, showed the way safely in front just off the inside down the
backstretch, had BEACH BOY AL advance with seven-sixteenths to go and was under pressure from that rival through the turn getting placed to coaxing at
the five-sixteenths in response, swung two to three wide for home, dug in dueling through the length of the stretch headed for command by BEACH BOY AL
a furlong out, got joined by a flanking trio near the sixteenth marker, came again narrowly to take command inside that station brushed and lightly bumped
by the pair now to his inside before being caught in the last strides to the finish. EMINENCY bumped at the start by BERT BERT BERT, who broke inwards,
chased just off the inside from just off the pace coming under a drive at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and
whittled away at the leaders inside the final sixteenth running on to the finish but was out-finished in a blanket of rivals to the end. BEACH BOY AL coaxed
from the gate, raced three wide in aim of the leader before advancing to prompt that rival from the outside through the turn briefly coaxed along
intermittently, got set down continuing three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive dueling with RAW COURAGE and took narrow command a furlong
from home, fought on among a quintet clinging to command until headed just inside the sixteenth pole, then got out-finished in the final strides. HE'S GOT IT
four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch, made up ground late while being outkicked.
CAVE MAN hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside down the backstretch before tipping four wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. BERT BERT BERT broke in at the start bumping EMINENCY, chased two to three wide
under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. STATE PLANNING dwelt at the start conceding eight
lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and was
unable to make an impact. DEVIOUS BANKER five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing
at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.
