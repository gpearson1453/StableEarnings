Footnotes
SCORING DRIVE set the pace along the inside, met BATTLE OF WILL's bid in upper stretch, dueled gamely with that foe through the final furlong, and won
the head-bob on the wire. BATTLE OF WILL stalked two wide, shifted three wide down the backstretch, bid outside of a clear SCORING DRIVE in upper
stretch sparking a duel, battled through the final furlong, but lost the nod on the wire. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN tracked from midpack in the two path,
chased in the three path around the far turn, shifted to the four path entering the lane, stayed on thereafter, and held show from an outer bidding. RONALDS
GATSBY broke slowly, raced far off of the pace in the four path around the first turn, then in the two path around the far, shifted five wide in upper stretch,
rallied to bid for show in the final furlong, but was fended off for that position. OLE STUD MUFFIN lunged inwardly and bumped the gate at the start, stalked
along the inside early on, but lost position to outer foes at the half mile pole, saved ground off of the pace around the far turn, then failed to re-rally. BLAZE
OF GRAY pressed the pace three to two wide around the first turn, but faded turning for home. INTO WISHING tracked from midpack in the three path,
chased the leading trio from the inside around the far turn before tipping back to the three path entering the lane, but lacked a kick and tired. HALF
CAPPUCCINO was wrangled back between horses through the stretch for the first time, got rank due to the restraint, took the first turn in the three path
while off of the pace, shifted out to the five path entering the backstretch, improved to a tracking position shortly after, but faded around the far turn.
CATCHIN DRAMA broke slowly, and got outrun.

Footnotes
MRS. DELLA bumped an inner foe at the start, dueled for the lead two wide, assumed command turning for home, and widened under mild hand urging.
MAC LEGACY trailed along the inside into the turn, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, rallied to bid for place between horses at the furlong grounds,
and was second best. BOTH OURS stalked three wide, gained place in the four path entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with the leader shorty after,
then got outkicked by an inner foe for place at the furlong grounds. DOUBLE APPEAL bobbled slightly before bumping an outer foe at the start, raced off of
the pace along the inside, but bore outwardly approaching the three furlong pole, faltered while getting out passing that marker, trailed entering the lane, but
regained stride on his left lead in upper stretch, and passed tiring rivals. KELLIE MAE was inconsequentially bumped between horses at the start, dueled for
the lead inside of the eventual winner, but proved no match with five-sixteenths to go, and weakened through the lane. TUGBOAT tracked four wide, ranged
up turning for home, but bolted to the outer part of the track entering the lane, and subsequently faded. DISTORTED KITTY stalked along the inside, but
faded.

Footnotes
PRAYFORPEACE laid close up along the inside early on while a bit keen and bottled up behind the leader, shifted outside of that foe entering the turn with
a bit of rider encouragement to stay engaged, bid at the five sixteenths pole, vied turning for home, forged an advantage leaving the furlong pole, and drove
clear through the final sixteenth. BET HE'S READY set the pace along the inside, dug in to resist PRAYFORPEACE's bid passing the five sixteenths pole,
battled through upper stretch, but was headed at the furlong pole, and proved second best. B D VALESKI raced at the rear along the inside, split foes two
wide in upper stretch to bid for show outside of LUNAR ROCKET at the furlong grounds, and prevailed for that position a sixteenth out. LUNAR ROCKET
saved ground off of the pace, was coaxed into the turn, gained show from outer foes entering the lane, but only managed to chase the top pair thereafter,
and was bested for that position at the sixteenth pole. CYCLONE settled at the rear two wide, swung five wide entering the lane, but failed to factor. MIZZEN
MAN tracked the pace two wide, shifted four wide entering the lane, and made little impact. FRAMED pressed the pace three wide, but faded turning for
home, then weakened between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
OURPERFECTPRINCESS prompted the pace three wide, bid for the lead entering the lane, drove clear at the furlong grounds, and held sway. PLATINUM
QUEEN broke a step slowly, but rushed inside of foes to a stalking position behind the leading trio in the early staged, stalked before shifting three wide and
between horses in upper stretch, stayed on to bid for place inside of SPEAK TO ME at the sixteenth pole, and prevailed for that position. SPEAK TO ME
tracked four wide, ranged up turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the leader while vying for place in upper stretch, then got outfinished by an inner
foe for that position late. THE MISSING PIECE tracked two wide and between horses, then three wide entering the lane, but lacked a rally before tipping five
wide in midstretch, and failed to bid. THETRUTHISTHETRUTH broke inwardly, set the pace inside of a pair of rivals around the turn, but was headed soon
after the quarter pole, and gave way. EVE'S DELIGHT trailed around the turn, and never got involved. HOTMOLLY vied for the lead two wide and between
horses, but weakened passing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
ZIPPIN GIGI set a clear pace along the inside, met MARQUEE RIDE's bid into the far turn, shook away from that foe at the five sixteenths pole, drew clear
in upper stretch, and lasted to the wire. OVERANALYTICAL stalked three wide, chased the clear leader without progressing through upper stretch,
produced a late kick to narrow the leader's margin in the finals furlong, attempted a late bid, but ran out of ground while requiring mild rider-correction from
lugging in on the wire. MARQUEE RIDE stalked the clear leader two wide, bid into the far turn, but was turned away and failed to keep pace at the five
sixteenths pole, and tired. HADDASSAH'S DEVIL tracked the pace in the two path, drifted outwardly in midstretch, but kept on mildly to maintain a minor
reward. LIONESQUE laid off of the pace in the two path around the turns, and failed to threaten. GRAN MUCHACO rated far off of the pace along the
inside, then two wide around the far turn before tipping to the three path in upper stretch and stayed on between horses late, but missed reaching a minor
share. LUCKY CRUSADER trailed around the first turn, then took the far turn three wide and made little impact. MRTANDROSEYSBOY took a stuttered
step at the start, raced far off of the pace in the three to two path around the first turn, and failed to factor. OLD FORTY FIVE broke slowly, recovered to be
forwardly placed two wide and between horses around the first turn, but weakened in to the far turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
SIR GIANNIS trailed two wide, swung four wide and outside of leading rivals entering the lane, rallied to bid for the lead in the final sixteenth, and forged an
advantage late. INVINCIBILITY stumbled at the start yet still broke on top, set the pace along the inside, inched clear passing the quarter pole, held sway
into deep stretch, but was bested late. ONCOMING TRAIN pressed the pace two wide, but came under urging between horses at the three furlong pole, got
outkicked by an outer foe for place while sustaining stride, then kept on between horses in the final stages. FIRST GLIMPSE tracked along the inside,
chased along the rail through the lane, but lacked a bid. FLYING CURLIN stalked three wide, ranged up turning for home to attempt a bid approaching the
lane, but flattened out in upper stretch, and tired between horses.

Footnotes
HOLY CITY stalked two wide, bid outside of a tiring STREET N SOUR at the furlong grounds, led shortly after, and held sway to the wire. LORD ZED broke
slowly, laid off of the pace three to four wide around the turn, then chased well while staying on through the lane, and prevailed for place. LAPIS LAZULI
broke a step slowly, tracked along the inside, but had to pause behind the tiring pace-setter at the furlong grounds as an outer HOLY CITY got the jump,
altered course two wide passing that marker, then stayed on between late, but missed in the photo for place on the wire. TWENTYONE N CHANGE
bumped the inner part of the gate at the start, tracked the pace two to three wide and between horses around the turn, then chased well through the lane,
but did not have enough while getting outkicked by rivals on either side for minor rewards late. STREET N SOUR sped clear of an inner foe approaching the
half mile pole, took the turn in the two path, tired while drifting to the rail at the furlong grounds, and weakened inside of a group of rivals at the sixteenth
pole. KEYS INCLUDED brushed the gate while breaking slowly, lagged behind the field early on, then showed belated interest without threatening. MOSH
PIT got outrun.

Footnotes
DOCTRINAIRE pressed the pace two wide, assumed command in upper stretch, and held from an inner foe late. PERMANENTDETENTION bumped with
an inner foe at the start, saved ground off of the pace, rallied along the rail to produce a bid in the final sixteenth, but was kept at bay. FORTY THREE broke
a bit inwardly, stalked two to three wide around the turn before being bumped five wide entering the lane, and stayed on for a minor share. CUSTOMIZE MY
QUEST stalked along the inside, shifted to the four path entering the lane, solidly bumped an outer FORTY THREE in the process, then got outkicked by
that foe in upper stretch, wandered inwardly while giving way among rivals in midstretch, but saved a minor share. CATALINA LATRINA was bumped
between horses soon after the start, raced off of the pace in the three to five path around the turn, lugged a bit inwardly passing the quarter pole while
hanging on his left lead, delayed his lead change to inside the furlong grounds, and kept on thereafter. R AND R STAR took a bump from outer foes soon
after the start, raced far off of the pace, came into the lane six wide, and improved. PRIORITY POINTS bumped with an outer foe at the start, saved ground
far off of the pace, and moved up. CONQUISTADOR GOLD shied inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, chased from midpack in the two to four path
around the turn, and tired. HOLDEN PASS set the pace inside of the eventual winner, but was headed passing the quarter pole, and weakened between
horses. REACHFORTHESABER broke slowly, and showed little.
