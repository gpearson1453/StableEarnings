GAMESTONKS trailed briefly, advanced wide on the final turn, took over into the stretch and quickly pulled away under mild coaxing. OUR UPTOWN GIRL
stalked the loose leader. led briefly at the quarter pole but proved no match for the winner. STARSHIP LAOBAN hustled to the front early, was collared on
the final turn and offered little resistance. ONE WILD WOMAN dropped well behind, moved wide and was no factor. HALLIGIRL saved ground off the pace
and weakened steadily. SEVEN YEARS LATER flashed speed for half a mile and stopped.

near even terms in the stretch but could not get by the winner. STORMBEAM lacked speed, angled wide in the stretch and closed well. FAIRY WISH trailed
for half a mile then passed tiring opponents. WEST HORIZEN dropped back inside and was never in contention. UNO TIGRESS hustled to the front inside,
dueled through the turn and faded. LUSCIOUS LOLA raced along the inside and gave way readily.

HOISTTHEMAINSAIL urged to front off the inside before quarter mile, led clearly into stretch, ducked out sharply under left handed whip, was straightened
and edged off. ROAD TO SUCCESS prompted the winner outside, moved inside in the lane and was second best. FLIMFLAM MAN settled just behind the
leaders, moved inside and flattened out. ALONZO MOSELY broke awkwardly and raced far back then passed fading rivals. FRENCH TOAST lacked speed
saving ground and failed to respond. BUFFALO SHUFFLE raced close up early inside then weakened steadily.

boldly three wide to the front at the quarter pole, led briefly but was outfinished. BULLET BUTCH dueled between rivals then weakened nearing the eighth
pole. EDDIE'S CHARGE stumbled at the start and trailed then passed tiring rivals. STONEGATE chased off the pace in the two path and was finished on
the final turn. IMAGINE THIS saved ground within range for half a mile and stopped.

inside after the half, angled out, rallied, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. IRISH RIVIERA lacked speed, bid wide on the final turn and gained
late. HANDY dropped far behind, made a strong move wide on the final turn and was too late. MY AMANJENA broke slowest and trailed for half a mile and
lacked a response. MISSION OBERON raced close up for half a mile, chased inside and gave way. FOREST FIRE chased wide in striking range then faded
on the final turn. CAUSEIDIDITMYWAY earned a narrow advantage inside then stopped after three furlongs. BURN AND TURN reserved inside early, gave
way after half a mile losing contact with his field.

MILITARY HOP stalked wide, bid to the front into the stretch and edged away under steady encouragement. IRISH COLONEL broke alertly and angled
inside, was challenged into the stretch and weakened slightly. KADENS COURAGE lacked speed, angled wide advancing on the turn then flattened out
late. LOVERBOY LOU dropped far behind, moved extremely wide into the stretch rallying. ANZIO BEACH settled outside, moved wide on the turn and
lacked a rally. APPEALING FUTURE saved ground within range then gave way readily. MANOLETE trailed along the rail early then caught stopping
opponents. STRONG BREEZE was urged close up in the two path weakened steadily. CATCH FIRE forced the pace briefly then stopped abruptly.

THOUSAND PERCENT saved ground, angled out the turn then wore down the pacesetter and quickly moved clear. STAR LUCK vied briefly, drew away on
the turn, but proved no match for the winner. PHARAOH'S CITY steadied early and raced far back, circled on the turn and was up for the show.
CHAMPERS prompted the pace four wide and began fading on the turn. KOWBOY KARMA broke sluggishly and trailed early then passed tiring rivals.
DISCO'S BRIDGE was urged close up three wide then gave way. FARA'S KID lacked speed and failed to respond. SHANDIAN saved ground and
weakened steadily. IRONBOUND lagged far behind throughout. TACTICAL PURSUIT (IRE) stopped abruptly losing contact with his field.
