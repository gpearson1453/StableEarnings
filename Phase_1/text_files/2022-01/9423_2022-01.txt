A BIT BAD N BOUJEE raced off the rail, off the pace, stalked outside rivals on the backside, bid entering the far turn, dueled with BRODY SLAM, led into
the stretch and edged away, driving. BRODY SLAM stalked close up two wide, bid between rivals entering the far turn, dueled inside on the turn, dug in
gamely and came up second best. FASTLIFE raced off the pace inside, moved up on the rail on the backside, lacked room and was shuffled back at the
three eighths marker, angled out in the stretch and failed to rally. TREASURE SEEKER raced two wide off the pace, then three wide, chased the leaders on
the far turn and tired. CRIMSON LILLE raced four wide early, cleared off to set the pace on the inside, dueled briefly and gave way. RELENTLESS CANDY
bobbled at the start, vied inside for the early lead, then chased, gave way and stopped in the lane.

outside, moved clear briefly on the turn but was no match for the winner. INVENTIONIST prompted the pace inside began tiring on the turn and proved
empty in the lane. EXPLAIN chased outside, angled inside on the turn and weakened. JACKS AMERICAN PIE trailed early inside then passed rivals without
menacing. WE BE THERE raced outside between rivals and was never in contention. HALSTAAT raced very wide down the backstretch and faded steadily.

SOCIAL GROUP prompted the pace outside, took over before half a mile, repelled a challenge in the stretch and edged away. IMPACTFUL fanned wide on
the first turn, engaged the winner into the stretch but could not get by. YONDERING settled well behind along the rail, loomed threat near the quarter pole
but flattened out. LUCKY HERO was urged just off the leaders between foes and faded after five furlongs. MARTIAL EAGLE lagged far behind then caught
a fading opponent. CAPE MAY STYLE hustled to the front inside then was finished after three furlongs.

Footnotes
SKY TEMPLE raced two wide off the pace, moved up between rivals on the turn, rallied between horses passing the furlong marker, bumped with
DISTRACTANDATTACK and drew clear under urging. DISTRACTANDATTACK pressed the pace racing close up outside, bid on the far turn, took over,
dueled past midstretch, bumped with SKY TEMPLE, dug in gamely and then came up second best. SCOOP DAWG raced four wide early, then stalked
three wide, chased three wide on the far turn, rallied outside rivals in the stretch drive and was outkicked. HORSE BE WITH YOU was reluctant to load,
stalked between rivals, raced inside on the turn and lacked a winning bid. GO HUSKIES raced three wide early, went four wide on the backside and failed to
threaten. GRAZELY raced three wide off the pace and did not factor. DRONE SWARM raced off the pace inside and did not factor. JOHNNY OIL was
reluctant to load, set the pace in the two path, dueled and tired. MR. TUTTLE raced close up inside, chased inside and gave way. A Jockey's Objection by
the rider of the runner up against the winner was dismissed.

angled inside advancing on the turn and closed well. RELISHMENT settled outside, rallied wide on the final turn then flattened out. TY RAN A HOMER
prompted the winner outside to the stretch and weakened. ALEJANDRO'S TEAM lagged far behind, bid very wide moving on the final turn. TOMATER
GATOR chased wide throughout and lacked a response. MONTELEONE saved ground, moved closer on the final turn then gave way. OFF THE MEDS
raced close up inside and retreated into the far turn. DENNARD saved ground off the pace and gave way readily.

CARTOUCHE settled behind the leaders, bid, took over midway on the turn, drew well clear and lasted. LULA'S ROADRUNNER advanced wide then rallied
into the stretch with a gradual late gain. CAUSE I SAID settled three wide within range, bid on the turn then proved empty in the stretch. AMATERASU
saved ground well behind then moved very wide in the stretch. HICKORY DICKORYDOC dropped back off the inside then passed rivals without menacing.
GIA'S FUEGO set a pressured pace in the two path to midway on the turn and faded. SOLID GOLD DANCER forced the pace along the rail then stopped
abruptly on the turn. PRESTO CHANGE O lacked speed and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MACH TRIAL stalked close up outside, moved up on the turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied steadily outside, collared the leader in deep stretch and
prevailed. JERSEY JOE B set the pace on the inside, responded when roused, turned back a bid from HARD WEST, edged away, then dug in gamely in the
final furlong and yielded grudgingly. JUMP SHOT chased two wide, raced three wide on the turn, rallied mildly outside and earned the show spot. HARD
WEST chased close up two wide, bid at the quarter pole, could not go with JERSEY JOE B, then weakened. HIZAAM raced off the rail, off the pace, moved
up four wide on the turn and closed belatedly outside. CAN'T SAY NO raced three wide off the pace, three wide on the turn and failed to rally. RIVERS OF
LITE raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. MUCHO MAS GRANDE raced off the pace between rivals and failed to threaten. STRAWBERRY RED
tracked inside, then chased and faded. FED FEVER raced off the pace, saved ground on the turn and did not factor.
