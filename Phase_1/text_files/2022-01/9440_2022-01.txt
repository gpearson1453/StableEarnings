Footnotes
MASHNEE GIRL went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, controlled the action in the two path around the turn, responded well when
asked at the quarter-pole and drew off under steady urging. SHALIMAR GARDENS broke out then brushed with a foe, moved out early then was taken in
hand, tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased in the three path on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no
match while clear for the place. THAT IS KEY settled just off the pace on the outside, dropped back under urging in the four path on the turn and lacked the
needed response while up for the show late. DESTINATIONWNRSCIR was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, moved up with five furlongs to run,
saved ground under coaxing on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch, shied in from a right-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths then was taken
under a protective hold while faltering, was placed under very light coaxing under threat from THAT IS KEY for third in the final sixteenth and lost the show
while continuing to falter under the wire. VOICE OF SPRING settled on the outside, was urged along in the two path on the turn and failed to respond. LEFT
LEANING LUCY brushed with a rival at the start, was taken in hand after being carried out some early, moved to the outside around the three-quarter pole,
was urged along outside the half-mile pole, went five wide on the turn and capitulated.

light coaxing near the three-eighths pole, widened away through the latter portion of the turn to a commanding lead, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive growing a bit leg weary late while holding clear to the finish kept to task. ANNIKA GOLD chased along the inside advancing
through the turn and coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide for home and offered up a mild kick to chase the winner home
clear of the rest for the place honors. GRINGOTTS four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn before making
his way along the inside placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, proved no match for the top pair while
keeping on well clear and best of the rest. STEFANIE ON FLEEK four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths, continued four wide into
upper stretch and tired. SUBIACO chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, tipped out nearing the quarter pole and went seven wide
into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. FOXTAIL showed the way early on from the two path while in hand, had LADY BY CHOICE range up
inside and was displaced from the front with five furlongs to run, came under coaxing in pursuit at the three-eighths, faded through the latter portion of the
turn and went five wide for home, then folded in the stretch. WAIT A MINUTE chased three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide
into upper stretch and gave way. INDIAN BELLA chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and

Footnotes
NORMAN QUEEN went to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, shook clear coming to the quarter-pole,
responded well when set down into upper stretch, came under a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker and drew off under strong urging. STEPPIN'
HAWK pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back coming to the five-sixteenths, moved to the rail nearing the
quarter-pole and proved no match for the winner while able to get the place. BAVARIAN CREME was reluctant to load, bumped soundly with a rival at the
start, chased the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and tired while able to get the show. OUR JESSICA
bumped hard with a foe at the start, angled in at the rear around the five-eighths, hesitated before going through inside a foe around the nine-sixteenths,
saved ground on the turn, passed the three-eighths under coaxing, was taken back in hand and hesitated again behind horses approaching the
five-sixteenths, was roused outside the quarter-pole, turned into upper stretch in the two path and failed to threaten. VIVAZANO dropped back early then
was urged along off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, went three then two wide on the turn and failed to respond. LUCKY GIRL moved in
while urged along off the pace, came under stronger encouragement while moving from the rail to the two path on the turn, dropped back four wide into the
stretch and came up empty. DOROTHY'S THE BOSS was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was driven five
wide into the stretch and was no factor. SABREEN chased the pace, went around the turn in the two path, dropped back three wide into the stretch and
retreated.

Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE POETRY hustled from the start, came inwards placing GLITTER UP in tight early along the rail before chasing that rival in closest aim just off
the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily gaining outside to get up in the
final jumps and prevail. GLITTER UP broke out under hustling at the start bumping and pinching CONTINENTALCONGRES back against CHAMPAGNE
POETRY, then got placed in tight briefly on the rail before establishing command to show the way in hand along the inside, came under light coaxing at the
three-eighths pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under threat and was caught in the last strides to
the finish. CONTINENTALCONGRES bobbled at the break and was pinched back due to pressure from GLITTER UP and conceded two lengths to the
front, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied along the rail and was
forced to pause when stymied in behind GLITTER UP a sixteenth out while awaiting CHAMPAGNE POETRY to clear outside, then altered out in the late
stages while clear for the show honors. MOSTLY HARMLESS bobbled at the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and kicked on belatedly for the last major share. CUPIDS GIRL bobbled at the start, came
under hustling and chased four paths off the inside early on before tucking steadily to the inside with nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing midway on
the turn, angled out four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. PARAPLUIE broke a half a beat slow and conceded three to four lengths to the
front before settling into stride, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and offered no
response. BELLESHAZZA chased three then two wide coaxed along from the get go, angled in to take the inside route into upper stretch and tired. DOLCE
SERA broke out at the start and came under hustling five paths off the inside early on, tucked in tandem with CUPIDS GIRL to her inside near the
nine-sixteenths to the three path, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, went three wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
GIOCARE just off the inside through the first turn near the rear of the field, tipped three to four wide down the backstretch before tucking back to the two
path through the far turn, came under coaxing nearing the three-eighths and advanced, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge
through the final furlong taking command seventy yards from home, then edged away to the finish to prevail. PIER FORTY hustled from the gate, raced
forwardly placed four then three wide through the first turn before advancing to vie outside a quartet with five furlongs to go, emerged from that fracas in
tandem with HIGH TIDE to his inside and dueled through the far turn with that rival under coaxing from near the three-eighths, spun three wide for home,
dug in under a drive taking command near the eighth pole and under growing threat to the outside, got collared seventy yards from home and was along
well clear of the rest and second best. HIGH TIDE just off the inside through the first turn just off the pace, advanced in tandem with rival to vie among a
quintet with five furlongs remaining, emerged to duel with the aforementioned foe to his outside through the far turn under coaxing from the three-eighths
tucking from the two path to the inside, took the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front nearing the eighth pole and weakened to the finish while
along for the show honors. JOHNNYPUMP chased just off the inside throughout coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and weakened in the stretch.
ROYAL TRYST saved ground growing detached well behind at the tail of the field, came under urging with seven-sixteenths to go, advanced improving
position through the latter portion of the far turn, swung three wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. FINGAL bobbled at the break,
settled just off the pace just off the inside early on, tipped out three then four wide through the far turn getting placed to coaxing midway, angled five wide
into upper stretch and tired. BLU GROTTO came under coaxing and established the front to show the way along the inside through the first turn under some
pressure from SANDRO THE GREAT to the outside, tipped to the two path down the backstretch and got joined by a quartet nearing the five-eighths marker
and vied inside those rivals to emerge briefly in concert with PIER FORTY and HIGH TIDE before being displaced from the front nearing the
seven-sixteenths, chased through the far turn and began to retreat when taking the inside route into upper stretch, then folded in the drive. LIAM'S FIRE
hustled from the gate, raced three wide in aim of the front through the first turn before advancing to vie between foes midway down the backstretch, went
four wide through the far turn under coaxing and faded, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish. SANDRO THE GREAT
coaxed from the start, prompted BLU GROTTO to the outside three then two wide through the first turn and then three wide into the backstretch, got joined
by an additional trio five furlongs from home and backed away overwhelmed placed to coaxing with half a mile to run, chased through the turn giving way
and was eased near the five-sixteenths and finished under his own power to the wire.

the two path inside the three-eighths, extended the advantage into upper stretch, was given one pop of a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker then
another pop outside the sixteenth-pole before being placed under a hand-ride to the wire while much the best. HANALEI'S HOUDINI was coaxed along on
the outside, chased four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. LIL

five-sixteenths and tired but held the show. MAJESTIC DUNHILL moved in at the rear of the field, settled at the back, was urged along in the two path on
the turn and failed to respond. THE SOUND was bumped at the start, set the pace under pressure to the outside, lost the lead at the five-eighths, dropped
