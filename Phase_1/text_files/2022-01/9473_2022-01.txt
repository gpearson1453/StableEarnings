CALL OF HONOR away in good order, raced closest to the leader, took over late backstretch with minimal encouragement, shook clear turning for home,
increased advantage under steady handling. GRAVES MILL ROAD within striking distance out in the strip, continued forwardly and outside, chased the
winner into the stretch, proved no match for that one, clear for the place. BEHAVIN MYSELF lacked speed off the inside, raced five wide into the far turn
when beginning a mild advance, came four wide into the stretch, continued to rally modestly to be along for the show late. DEMIGOD void of speed, four out
to five wide turning for home, belated interest to miss the show spot. AXIS went one paced throughout off the inside, three wide second turn, lacked a
closing kick to finish up evenly. AFRICAN WARRIOR within striking distance for six furlongs just off the inside, came up empty for the drive. CHASE
TRACKER settled off the pace, also lacked a closing response in the two path. OREGON COUNTY four wide into the first turn, continued outside, four wide
again by early in the second turn, steered in a bit later in that bend but tired through the stretch. INTO ORBIT off a step slow, remained always back. STUD
PUPPY was finished early. TRAIL DRIVER a bit unruly loading,broke on top, cleared early, stopped when headed by the winner into the far turn while
continuing inside.

Footnotes
NISI PRIUS broke alertly, dueled up the backstretch along the inside, headed into the turn, battled back to retake a short advantage by late in the bend,
shook clear inside the furlong marker then held the runner up safe under firm handling. LET'S CRUISE raced in the second flight toward the inside, shifted
out a bit midway on the turn, tracked the winner from the outside past the furlong marker, could not get to that one late, held sway for the place. HARD
STREET broke just behind the winner, dueled with that one on the outside, put a head in front entering the turn, remained on near equal terms into the
stretch, gradually weakened to lose the second spot late, remained well clear of the others. PREMIER WISH off a step slow, raced well back early as a
result, swung out four wide turning for home, lacked a significant closing response to finish up evenly. CAUGHT LOOKING lacked speed while racing three
wide, failed to muster a rally. BITTER VIXEN in the second flight while racing three wide, tired in the drive. SIMONA'S CHOICE was finished early while
racing four wide.

Footnotes
SHI O'SHI broke with the field, mid pack early, moved closer while angling in entering the turn, shuffled back along the rail soon after, continued in traffic
through the bend, eased out a bit and split foes past the furlong marker, edged clear under steady handling. GIRLS A BULLET raced back off the early pace
outside, fanned six wide into the lane, challenged on the outside approaching midstretch, could not match the winner late, proved determined for the place.
LICHITA moved up to sprint clear before a quarter, narrowly showed the way through and out of the turn, continued to hold a small advantage past the
furlong marker, could not contain the top two late, saved the show.. MY BOSS LADY off a step slow, trailed early as a result off the inside, angled out

Footnotes
MAGNOLIA MIDNIGHT within striking distance off the inside, three wide and behind traffic turn, eased out a bit for the drive for room, roused, kicked down
leaders. AMERICAN XPERIMENT narrowly set the pace early while between foes, continued to hold a narrow advantage into the stretch, headed past the
furlong marker, retook the advantage late, caught in the final strides. PRESSURE bumped with FORTY STRIPES at the break, quickly recovered to race
with the pace while closest to the inside, continued to contest the issue into and through upper stretch, gave ground grudgingly to the top two late. BACK TO
NORMAL pressed the issue from the outside in the run up the backstretch, three wide through the turn, gained a brief advantage with a furlong remaining,
could not last. SWIFT TAP within striking distance outside, four wide when moving slightly closer then flattened out in the drive. FORTY STRIPES broke
sharp while bumping with PRESSURE, quickly fell back to trail into the turn off the inside, moved out a bit turning for home then lacked a significant closing
response.

Footnotes
FUNTIMEGIRL close from the start toward the inside, steered out late in the turn, three wide rally down the lane, kicked down leader late.
PRINCEDREAMCESS broke sharply, relinquished the advantage to an inside rival before a quarter, took back over entering the stretch, shook clear, could
not contain the winner while clearly second best. DISTORTED SECRETS last to leave, began a steady advance in the two path midway on the turn, along
for the show late, no threat to the top two. AIN'T SHE A PISTOL in mid pack and toward the inside early, angled out to be four wide turning for home,
closest to the top two past the furlong marker, flattened out a bit to be caught for the show spot. ARGUMENTAL lacked speed well out in the strip, raced
four wide through the turn, came five wide for the drive, improved position, no real threat. FASHIONABLY QUICK lacked speed inside, continued to save
ground through the turn, also picked up a few rivals through the lane while never dangerous. HOT TUB HOTTIE broke mid pack, used a bit early to move up
and show the way, dueled through much of the turn inside the runner up, gave way in the drive. FIGHTINGTEMPTATION lacked speed, asked along three
wide turn, passed tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. VITA BONA tired while racing off the inside. BLAME NELLIE in mid pack and outside, faded
while racing three out to four wide. RACEDAY ATTIRE prompted the issue for a half three wide then backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
SPECIAL PRYCE lacked speed well wide, advanced steadily while five wide through the turn, six path into the lane, kept coming to be up in time.. ERNIE
BANKER raced in mid pack in lacking early foot, waited in traffic late in the turn, shifted out for room, bid inside the furlong marker, led late, nipped at wire.
BIG BOSS BEN with the pace two path into the turn, took over to show the way past midstretch, weakened a bit in the late going to be caught, remained
clear for the show. APPRAISAL within striking distance off rail after breaking in good order, steadied behind the first flight midway on the turn, fell back
slightly then went evenly through the lane. WINDCRACKER in the second flight inside, waited behind a wall of horses then steadied a bit entering the
stretch, shifted out and also finished up in one paced fashion. ROAD BIBLE void of speed, encountered some traffic while four wide midway on the turn,
came five wide into the lane, also found lacking in the run through the stretch when called on. FIVE DREAMS settled in mid pack and off the inside, five
wide into the turn, is another who encountered traffic and lacked clear racing room late in the turn, came four wide into the stretch then tired a bit. WISE
KHOZAN off slowly, raced back while saving ground, steadied nearing the furlong marker, remained back in the run to the wire. AMERICAN CHAOS broke
inward but alertly, cleared to the inside, narrowly showed the way into the turn, folded up when the real running began at the head of the lane. WHEREVER
HE IS failed to menace while racing four wide. THAT'S SOMETHING prompted the early pace three to four wide, backed up in the drive.

the second bend, took over when straightened for home, drew well clear. SKATE TO HEAVEN carried out five wide into the first turn, raced three wide up
the backstretch and into the far turn, steadied behind traffic nearing and past the furlong grounds, moved outside and finished up evenly. ROME balked at
loading then broke sharp, vied up front into the first turn, allowed the leader to go before a quarter, took over when asked along and got clear into the
stretch, proved no match for the winner the final furlong, caught late for the place. FAST LANE maintained inside position into the first turn, got clear before
a quarter, showed the way the middle half, began to weaken when headed in the far turn, continued to gradually weaken in the run to the wire. SWITZER
four wide when within striking distance in the first turn, continued well wide, four wide far turn, three wide into the lane and tired. KENTUCKY BOURBON off
a step slow, raced back, dropped inside second turn, improved position while not a serious threat. PINCH HITTER lacked speed, three wide through the
second turn, failed to muster a significant rally when called on for the drive. PAID IN FULL forwardly placed, continued within striking distance toward the
inside, gave way in the drive. BLUE NORTHER prompted the pace while racing three wide, had little left for the drive as well. LITTLE FRAPPUCINO saved

Footnotes
RATED R SUPERSTAR unhurried early along the inside, moved closer up the inside into the far turn, brief wait, lost some position soon after, steered out to
be three wide for the drive, roused, willing rally to be up in time. MUCHO broke sharp, cleared toward the inside before a quarter, set a brisk pace along the
inside, shook off his closest opponent inside the furlong grounds to be clear again late, could not contain the winner. THOMAS SHELBY forward early
inside, moved out onto the backstretch, challenged the runner up from the outside through the second turn, could not keep up the final furlong, remained
comfortably clear for the show.;. NECKER ISLAND lacked speed while off the inside, three wide into the far turn, encountered some traffic soon after,
dropped inside midway on that final bend, improved position a bit in the drive while not a threat to the top three. SILVER PROSPECTOR five wide through
the entire first turn, continued to race outside, four out to five wide in the second bend, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response.
SNAPPER SINCLAIR settled off the pace and the inside, steered three wide turning for home, came up empty in the drive. ATOKA last away, trailed early
while four wide in the first turn, lodged a five wide move briefly into contention in the second bend then gave way. LONG RANGE TODDY was finished early
while turning in a four wide trip. CONCERT TOUR moved out a bit to be three wide, within striking distance while remaining three wide through the second
turn, gave way readily in the drive.

Footnotes
GAR HOLE back off the pace outside, four wide gain through the turn, took over when straightened for home, kicked clear under his own courage to win
ridden out. NAVY SEAL lacked speed, race four out to five wide through the turn, up late for the place, no match for the winner. GOODNIGHT ARCHIE
forwardly placed while three wide, also proved no match for the winner in the drive, caught late for the place spot. DATA STORM chased the leader from
along the inside up the backstretch, fell back a bit in the turn, through the stretch. CITRUS BAY void of speed, swung out five wide turning for home,
improved position with some belated interest down the middle of the strip. IMA BLING CAT went one paced three wide in lacking a closing response. MO
CHOCTAW broke on top despite bobbling slightly, set the pace just off the inside, gave way when headed by the winner into the stretch. HOLDING
PATTERN off slowly, trailed for a half, came four out to five wide out of the turn, passed tiring rivals while never a threat. RUBIGINOUS in traffic into the turn
while three wide, dropped inside, faded through the stretch. CAPTAIN DON within striking distance just off the inside, tired. PRIVATE LAKE remained
always back. STOMPING HOTROD asked along to maintain position, steadied in traffic three wide early in the turn, faded down the stretch.
