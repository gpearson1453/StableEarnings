Footnotes
EPOCH underwent a shoe repair, stalked along the inside then a bit off the rail into the lane, tipped outside MO GOLD in the stretch, drew alongside with a
sixteenth remaining and edged past. MO GOLD got bumped from outside at the start then quickly cleared, set all the pace to the stretch, remained clear into
the final furlong, collared by the winner past the sixteenth pole and was overtaken while finishing gamely to the line. GODSEND was off slow from inside,
saved ground from off the pace through the turn, showed a mild response to urging and bested the rest. ST ANTHONY was off slow from outside, lagged
behind early off the rail, angled to the inside for the turn, steered out entering the lane and upper stretch and passed tired rivals. BLUE DOG tracked off the
rail then outside a rival, went three then two wide on the turn, angled out from behind rival in the stretch and lacked further response. GUSTAV got knocked
into inside rival at the start, lacked room behind foes on the turn and checked approaching the quarter pole and had little left for the stretch run. RING
GENERAL brushed the gate then veered in and bumped rival at the start, tracked in the two path around the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
ALL DIALED IN was off a bit slow then got bumped a few times between rivals at the start, trailed early then advanced outside a rivals into the turn, ranged
up three deep with five-sixteenths remaining, took over nearing the top of the lane, kicked clear quickly and drew off under some right-handed urging and
strong handling. FEELING FLUSH broke out a bit then sped to the front, set the pace with BELLEO'S MUSIC alongside, maintained a short lead through the
turn, was overtaken leaving the bend, could not kick on the with the winner in upper stretch and stayed on to secure the place. BELLEO'S MUSIC was off
alertly, pressed the pace from outside into and around the turn, lost contact into the stretch and flattened out. YES YOUR GRAZE chased off the rail,
navigated the turn two to three wide and lacked a rally. LITTLE SUSIE bumped inner rival two times at the start, chased a bit off the rail into the turn, started
to weaken around the bend, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
ANACONDA settled off the pace, drew closer around the turn and angled out with a quarter mile left to run, came four wide into the stretch, reached the
front in midstretch and drew clear. SEE THROUGH IT got bumped leaving the gate, vied four deep up the backstretch, three deep leaving the turn, cleared
in upper stretch but was soon challenged by ANACONDA, yielded to that rival and kept on to hold second. RIDING WITH DINO stumbled leaving the gate
but still came away quickly, was quickly taken hold of to sit off the pace, saved ground to the stretch along the rail, then steered out in the lane and
summoned a mild rally for the show. AUGUSTA MELODY broke a step slow, vied between foes into and around the turn, fought to upper stretch and
faltered in the furlong grounds. SPIRIT MAKER broke a step slow but came away cleanly, hand to steady off heels early, went two wide into the turn, swung
six wide leaving the bend, improved placings in the lane but failed to threaten. CITY RAGE broke in and bumped rival at the start, sat off the pace and
moved inside, steered four wide leaving the turn and could not rally. ESCAPE ROUTE dropped back early, saved ground into the lane and was not a factor.
SILARDI was off a bit slow, went up to vie for command from inside, battled through the turn, then gave way in the lane. LOVE MY JIMMY vied for
command three deep and between foes, was getting out and around the bend which caused him to lose touch with top trio, continued to drifted out a bit
further before entering the stretch and faded in the drive.

HAPPY TRAILS broke out and bumped rival at the start, steadied slightly off heels early, traveled along the inside, angled out and made a swift move
outside the top trio at the quarter pole, took over then cleared in midstretch and stayed strong to the wire. LA PULCINELA got bumped from inside at the
start, stalked the leader up the backstretch, lacked room along the rail through the turn, finally gain a clear path at the top of the stretch and finished well
along the rail to gain the place. FLAT OUT JOY bobbled leaving the gate, chased off the rail, moved up outside the top pair under confident handling at the
quarter pole, roused by the rider in upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. VEGAN came away well to grab the lead, set the pace under pressure
from DIRT FLIRT, vied with rivals around the bend, was overtaken nearing the stretch, was outkicked for the place and show but stayed on to the wire. DIRT
FLIRT pressed the pace from outside, bid two wide around the turn, lost contact leaving the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
FRIAR'S ROAD stalked the pace in the two path, angled to the rail on the final turn, came a bit off the rail into the stretch, moved out in the lane, rallied to
the front in midstretch and won going away. BOB AND JACKIE traveled up close to the outside of ACCLIMATE early on, engaged that rival at the
five-eighths pole, dueled into and around the far turn, took over with a quarter mile left to run, held a short lead into the furlong grounds but was overtaken
past the eighth pole and kept on to save the place. SAY THE WORD was off slow to begin, drifted out a bit crossing surfaces, was reserved in the two path
outside a rival, went two to three wide into the lane, angled out in the stretch and showed a mild late response to miss second. LINCOLN HAWK (IRE)
settled off the pace on the inside, lacked room behind a rival on and was hemmed in by another foe on the far turn, found room to run and was roused at the
quarter pole but could not rally in the stretch run. ACCLIMATE took control early and steered to the inside, pressured by BOB AND JACKIE at the
five-eighths, dueled inside that rival into and around the far turn, lost command at the quarter pole, had the rider lose the whip in upper stretch, fought to the
furlong grounds and weakened.

Footnotes
UNWRITTEN CODE was off alertly to taken control, set the pace in the two path entering the turn, angled to the rail around the bend, drew away in upper
stretch and held well in the late stages. BOLD CHOICE raced up close on the inside, lost some ground to the leader entering the turn, traveled a bit off the
rail into the stretch, came back in the final furlong and whittle the gap late. EVERLYS GIRL brushed the gate and came away slow, chased along the inside,
spun three wide into the drive and finished willingly to earn the show. PRESKITT stumbled a bit leaving the gate but was still forwardly placed outside the
pacesetter, chased two to three wide around the turn and flattened in the drive. ADDYDIDIT chased off the inside, angled out and came five wide into the
lane and lacked a rally. ROMAN EMPRESS tracked outside rivals, went four wide around the turn, bothered by EVERLYS GIRL coming out at the top of the
lane and could not rally. WARREN'S QUEEN BEE chased outside rivals, three then two wide on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
MAGLEV (IRE) broke a step slow, was reserved in the early going and steered off the rail, closed in four wide through the turn, rallied to the front in upper
stretch and cleared approaching the eighth, then drew off while coasting in late. DON'T SWEAR DAVE chased three deep while pulling between rivals, was
forced to check past the three-eighths pole, dropped back and angled down to the inside, steered out in the stretch and rallied gamely for the place under
mild encourgament. OLYMPIC LEGEND broke well and took control early, set the pace under pressure from outside, dueled along the rail through the turn,
was overtaken approaching the eighth pole, took a bad step past the sixteenth pole while weakening late but saved the show. ECHOSMITH (IRE) was off a
bit slow to begin, chased between foes while pulling hard early, continued between foes around the turn, moved out in the stretch and missed the show.
FRANKLIN ONE STAR pressed the pace from outside, dueled two wide through the turn and into the lane, then weakened in the final furlong.
SMUGGLER'S RUN was rated inside a trio of runners up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, steadied in upper stretch and continued to lack
room through the lane and never found a clear path. SHUT UP MICHAEL (IRE) chased four deep to the turn, three deep around the bend and weakened. IL
CAPITANO was off slow and lost his path at the start, angled to the rail then came back out and entered the stretch three wide and was outrun.
