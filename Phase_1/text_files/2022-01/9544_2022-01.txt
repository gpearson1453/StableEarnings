Footnotes
SAVAGE SAILOR settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled three wide midway around the far turn, closed outside, was up leaving the eighth pole
and powered clear under left-handed urging. BOARD CERTIFIED stalked the pace four wide around the first turn, bid three wide around the far turn,
reached near even terms midway around that bend, vied outside of POETIC CODE from there past midstretch, was no match for the winner but won the
duel to earn the place. POETIC CODE bumped with FORT ATTITUDE at the start, set a pressured pace in the two path, dug in inside of BOARD
CERTIFIED when that foe reached near even terms midway around the far turn, led past the eighth pole and was outfinished. CLASSIC FILM saved ground
well back, tipped two wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. DAKOTA BOY broke awkward, steadied incessantly, rushed up between foes down the
backstretch, chased four wide between around the far turn and faded in the lane. MUROMEC was off slowly, raced off the pace two and three wide and
never threatened. FORT ATTITUDE bumped with POETIC CODE at the start, pressed that foe while hard held three wide and tired nearing the lane.
SUMMER SHANDEE had early speed inside and steadily faded. ONE MORE DAY played no factor while racing three wide. ELBRILLO was outrun inside.
ECCENTRICO failed to menace while racing at least five wide throughout. PAPA CHARLES raced four wide, had no response around the far turn and was
vanned off.

Footnotes
AWESOME FAMILY sprinted to the led and angled inside soon after the start, took on a pair of rivals mid-way around the turn, dueled inside into the stretch
run, held a slight edge over ADMIRAL TRUFFLES in the final furlong, dug in gamely and held firm. ADMIRAL TRUFFLES hustled along two wide in pursuit
of the early leader, edged up to engage AWESOME FAMIY mid-way around the turn, dueled into the upper stretch, remained in striking distance through
the lane could not get by. NOBEL raced in close range along the inside in opening stages, roused forward and vied for the lead mid-way around the turn,
angled inside in the upper stretch, stayed on with inside response and prevailed for a share. FIVEFINGERDISCOUNT broke in and bumped with rival at the
start, raced between foes off the second flight entering the turn, dropped to the inside and saved ground entering the lane, sustained a steady bid on the rail
but lacked the needed surge for serious impact. JOYFUL SURPRISE raced in pursuit along the outside, was ridden along three wide around the turn,
stayed on three to four wide in the lane and needed more. MIDNIGHT TEQUILA raced in the back three to four wide, came four wide into the upper stretch
and lacked a needed rally. LOVE ME ARCHIE got bumped at the start, raced inside of a duo off the second flight leaving the backstretch, weakened
mid-way around the turn, tipped out wider for the drive and had no late response.

furlong and edged clear. MORNING COLORS pulled early prompting APPOINTED from outside, took over after six furlongs, was clear with an eighth of a
mile to go but could not hold the top one safe. I'M LISTENING raced three wide on the turns, had aim into the stretch but needed more. STARSHIP
MALLOMAR saved ground to the far turn, moved out three wide into the stretch, and lacked a solid closing response. GREY CHARLOTTE saved ground to
no avail. APPOINTED set the pace for six furlongs, and tired.

Footnotes
LURE HIM IN stalked the pace two wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, drifted into the four path turning for home, repulsed a bid in upper stretch
and widened under a drive. SIGILOSO set the pace in the two path around the first turn, angled in early on the backstretch, set the pace along the rail from
there to the five-sixteenths marker, could not match strides with the winner but fought on inside to regain the place. SHAMROCKET bumped with CUCINA
at the start, trailed two wide early, went three wide around the far turn, came widest into the lane and had a mild rally to gain the show. MAX K. O. had his
head turned at the start, raced in range three wide, bid three deep nearing the lane, was floated out turning for home then weakened while getting in a bit
through the final furlong. HERCULES broke a bit awkwardly but near the front, raced off the pace two wide, was pulling around the first turn, continued two
wide around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. CUCINA bumped with SHAMROCKET at the start, stalked the pace from the rail and faded through
the lane.

FREEZER BURN sped to the lead and angled inside soon after the start, held firm still unleashed around the turn, saved ground entering the lane,
responded under right handed encouragement in the upper stretch, widened to a commanding lead and kept to task. YOU'RE THE BEST raced in range
two wide in early stages, was ridden along three wide around the turn, stayed on two wide in pursuit of the winner through the lane and finished well clear
for second best. BAHAMIAN BEAUTY was forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, chased two wide around the turn, sustained a three wide bid in
the lane and secured show. LADY MECHANIC was not too far back and five paths wide in early stages, hustled up on the outside through the turn, came
five wide into the upper stretch and lacked the needed response for impact. IDEAL BREEZE raced in contention along the inside, chased the pace around
the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and steadily weakened. MUSICALLY INCLINED raced inside off the early pace, tipped three wide turning for home
and failed to respond. MISS LAMARR chased four paths wide through early stages, came five wide into the upper stretch and faded.

ONE IDENTITY vied inside HARD TO CAPTURE for a half-mile, shook that one off turning for home and widened while kept busy. MILES OF SMILES
raced three to four wide around the turn, and was along outside to go clear for the place. LONDON LADY bobbled at the start, saved ground around the turn
and into the stretch, and had no final response. TAG HER was urged along outside the leaders on the turn, and could not keep pace into the stretch. HARD
TO CAPTURE dueled outside ONE IDENTITY for a half, and tired. UP IN THE AIR broke a step slow, and was outrun three wide. FOLKLAW dropped far
back after a half, and jogged in.

Footnotes
CREDIBILITY settled off the pace while racing two wide, edged closer three wide around the far turn, rallied outside and was up in the final strides.
ETERNAL REST set a clear pace in the two path, held clear past the eighth pole, lugged in under right-handed urging in deep stretch and was caught late.
ALWAYS GAMBLING saved ground in midpack, rallied along the rail in the lane then was forced to check when shut off in deep stretch. LAMENT saved
ground at the rear of the field, swung four wide nearing the lane, continued on the left lead in the stretch and rallied despite lugging in throughout the stretch
run. WAKE SURF stalked the pace in the clear two and three wide and faded in the lane. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION FROM THE
RIDER OF ALWAYS GAMBLING, ETERNAL REST WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP
STRETCH.

Footnotes
LIAM'S KISS sped to the lead and angled inside soon after the start, set the pace up the backstretch, took on the challenge from BUTTERBEAN midway
around the far turn, dueled into the stretch run, held a slim advantage past the furlong marker, dug in gamely and edged clear. BUTTERBEAN raced two to
three wide around the first turn and stalked the early pacesetter, moved up two wide to engage LIAM'S KISS midway around the far turn, dueled into stretch
run, stayed on with response but could not match with the winner in late stages. BLAMETHECHAMPAGNE secured inside position around the first turn,
rated near midpack up the backstretch, launched an inside bid around the far turn, sustained inside bid into the stretch run, angled out three wide in late
stages, finished with response and gained show. MITIGATION was well placed tracking the pace in close range, launched a three wide bid mid-way around
the far turn, turned for home three wide, ran on evenly in late stages and lost show. SIEMPRE ELEGANTE raced three wide around the first turn, settled
outside not too far off the early pace, was ridden along three wide into the upper stretch and failed to kick on. SPREAD JOY was unhurried and saved
ground up the backstretch, hustled up four wide into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. PRETTY PROVOCATIVE was unhurried out of the gate
and raced three wide around the first turn, continued reserved in the back, hustled up along the rail leaving the turn and passed tiring rivals in the lane.
HOLIDAY PRINCESS raced three to four wide off the early pace, swung six paths wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. AGRAFFE got in tight
and steadied heading into the first turn, raced off the pace and saved ground, came five wide into the lane and failed to menace. RITA MARGA raced up
close inside around the first turn, stalked up the backstretch, came up empty after entering the far turn and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
MACK set the pace in the two-path, and was driving to remain well clear late. SWEENEY'S CAT raced four wide most of the way, and won the battle for
second outside IMPRESSIVE SPEED. The latter bumped with SPECIAL MEISTER at the start, then had his heels clipped by that one a few strides later,
angled four wide leaving the far turn, and just missed the runner-up spot. COUCH DREAMS bumped with LUCKY AS A SEVEN at the start, swung five wide
leaving the far turn, and offered a mild response to share fourth. SKYWALKING broke slowly, fanned six wide into the stretch, and gained mildly without
threatening. BIG BLUE was strung out five wide on the first turn, pursued the pacesetter outside to the stretch, and weakened through the late stages.
BACH raced forwardly three wide early, and retreated after a half-mile. WESTERN ADVANTAGE was no factor inside. LUCKY AS A SEVEN bumped with
COUCH DREAMS at the start, fought rating early inside, raced close up to the stretch, and tired late. LORD DARNLEY bumped with SPECIAL MEISTER at
the start, stayed close early four wide, and gave way after six furlongs. SPECIAL MEISTER got bumped between LORD DARNLEY and IMPRESSIVE
SPEED at the break, then clipped the latter's heels a few strides later, and trailed. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
LOVELY LUVY had her head turned at the start, raced off the pace three wide under a hard hold, angled in early on the far turn, tipped three wide in upper
stretch, kicked in, swept to the front nearing the sixteenth pole and drew off while ridden out. SUGAR FIX stalked the pace in the three path, bid around the
far turn, reached even terms nearing the quarter pole, edged ahead in upper stretch but was no match for the winner late. KEY BISCAYNE threw her head
at the start, raced off the pace in the two path around the first turn, advanced inside down the backstretch, was in range at the rail around the far turn but
lacked the needed stretch rally. QUINOA TIFAH set the pace in the two path and weakened in the drive. SISTER OTOOLE chased the pace two and three
wide and lacked a closing bid. KELSEY'S CROSS failed to menace while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
STAR SHOPPING was allowed to settle out of the gate and saved ground around the first turn, was taken back off the early pace and settled nicely through
early stages, picked up the pace on the far outside late on the far turn, swung six wide into the lane, gained sharp momentum under steady urging, swept by
embattled rivals and finished clear. BELOVED WARRIOR tucked in to race two wide around the first turn, rated near midpack up the backstretch, edged up
closer then launched a three wide bid late on the far turn, vied for the lead into the final furlong, stayed on with response but failed to be a late match for the
winner. BLUTO'S CANDY bumped with FROSTY WARRIOR leaving the first turn, settled four wide in midpack up the backstretch, hustled up four wide
around the far turn, vied for the lead to the furlong marker and stayed on for a share. BIRDNOTE tracked the pace while saving ground through early
stages, was patiently handled around the far turn, given cue along the inside turning for home, raced in striking distance for the lead at the furlong marker
then flattened out. MILLENNIUM CONDO took over the lead around the first turn and set a pressured pace up the backstretch, vied for the lead around the
far turn, fought back into the upper stretch then came up tired in the final furlong. FISHING FOR FUN was forwardly placed in the early backstretch,
weakened past the half mile marker, steadied nearing the far turn, lost position, rebid three to four wide into the upper stretch and failed to move on. GLORY
AND VICTORY prompted the pace up the backstretch, dueled for the lead around the far turn and came up tired in the upper stretch. MACHO TIME raced
off the pace, swung wide into the lane and never menaced. FROSTY WARRIOR bumped with BLUTO'S CANDY coming of the first turn, tracked in close
range through early stages, came up empty late on the far turn, steadied and dropped back, vanned off after the race. CATATUMBO raced in the back
throughout and had no response.
