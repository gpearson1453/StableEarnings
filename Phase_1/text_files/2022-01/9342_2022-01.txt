Footnotes
SMART PEGASUS tracked along the inside, rallied two to three wide around the far turn, took aim on the leading pair entering the lane, and got up in the
final sixteenth. YOUNMEHONEYBUNNY vied along the inside, drew clear at the half mile pole, held sway while hanging on her left lead in upper stretch, but
was worn down in the closing stages. BLUE RIDGE QUEEN vied two wide early on, chased her inner counterpart into the far turn, and kept on through the
lane while well clear of the others. JUANANDORA stalked along the inside, but lacked a bid. MEG AND CLAIR trailed around both turns, shifted four wide in
midstretch, and improved. KITTENOFTHE COURT stalked two wide and from between horses around the first turn, then weakened around the second.
CAJUN SHOTS raced forwardly placed three wide, but was done entering the backstretch. BIRDCATMOUSE was put to a bit of tight quarters between
horses soon after the start, and got outrun.

Footnotes
THEBOYZGALAXY tracked along the inside, stalked three wide around the far turn, grinded away at a clear DISTRACTOR FACTOR's advantage while
hanging on her left lead, and reeled that foe in late. DISTRACTOR FACTOR set the pace, showed the way from a pressing CRIMSON FELINE around the
far turn, drew clear passing the quarter pole, but tired in the final furlong, and was worn down strides from the wire. LIL ASHLEY B. broke slowly and lagged
well behind the field early on, cut the gap on the rest of the field around the far turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, and stayed on willingly. CRIMSON
FELINE stalked three wide around the first turn, prompted DISTRACTOR FACTOR around the far turn, but failed to keep pace passing the quarter pole, and
weakened through the final furlong. SPECTACULAR IZZY stalked two wide, but faded at the half mile pole.

QUEST FOR AVETTE set the pace two wide, cut down to the rail into the turn, drew off at the quarter pole, and was driven home under strong urging
through the final furlong. MISTER DON tracked the pace four wide, then stayed on in upper stretch to gain place passing the furlong grounds, and lasted for
that position. HEREWECOMETOGETYOU trailed along the inside, then improved along the rail through the lane, attempted a late place bid, but did not
have enough. WIDDLE ZEE laid close up along the inside of a leading QUEST FOR AVETTE while in a bit of tight quarters, checked mildly to avoid being
pinched into the turn, shifted outside of the rival shortly after, pressed turning for home, but failed to keep pace at the quarter pole, tired, and was bested by
rivals on either side in the final furlong. VELVET RIDGE pressed the pace three wide, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. THE RIDER OF WIDDLE
ZEE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF QUEST FOR AVETTE FOR INTERFERENCE INTO THE TURN, BUT IT WAS DISALLWOED BY THE
STEWARDS.

Footnotes
BELEOUT vied three wide early on, drew off approaching the seven sixteenths pole, widened around the turn, maintained that margin through midstretch
while under strong encouragement, and was driven into the final sixteenth to seal the deal. THE GREY BEAUTY tracked three to four wide, bid for place in
upper stretch, and drove clear for that position in the final furlong while not threatening the leader. HONEYSUCKLEDELIGHT chased two wide and between
horses, bid for place at the quarter pole, but was outkicked for that position at the furlong grounds, and saved show. MOMENT TO DREAM tracked from off
of the pace two wide, shifted four wide in upper stretch, stayed on late to bid for show, but missed reaching that position on the wire. VIOLET SHADOWS
trailed after being slow into stride, rallied through midstretch, shifted to the four path at the sixteenth pole while picking off rivals, and split foes in tight
quarters late, but ran out of ground to reach show. MACEE vied two wide and between horses through the opening furlong, allowed her outer counterpart to
go on at the half mile pole, stalked that foe from the two to three path while many lengths off around the turn, then tired between horses in midstretch. MISS
CARUSO vied along the inside for a furlong, but failed to keep pace with outer foes at the half mile pole, sustained midpack chasing position around the
turn, failed to bid for place passing the quarter pole, and faded. WHEELS LIKE NALA was reluctant to load, raced well off of the pace early on, shied from a
veering COME ON BIRDE at the half mile pole, and never got involved. COME ON BIRDIE steadied when HONEYSUCKLEDELIGHT shifted across his
path at the nine-sixteenths despite that foe being well clear causing the rider to lose his balance, veered outwardly from behind kickback shortly after and
hindered WHEELS LIKE NALA, then took the turn in the five path while far off of the pace, and got outrun.

Footnotes
STAT showed speed outside of a pair of rivals out of the gate, but shifted inwardly and interfered those foes after a sixteenth of a mile, set the pace inside of
a pressing RUNANDHIDE WIND around the turn, then drew off at the quarter pole, and held sway. ALEBRIJE broke close up inside of a pair of foes, but
was pinched along the rail and steadied after a sixteenth of a mile, chased from midpack along the inside around the turn, bid for place inside of
RUNANDHIDE WIND at the furlong grounds, and edged that position a sixteenth out. RUNANDHIDE WIND vied between horses out of the gate, got forced
into his inner rival at the eleven sixteenths pole, then steadied shortly after as his outer counterpart continued to shift in, altered course two wide at the five
furlong pole, pressed around the turn, but proved no match at the quarter pole, tired, and lost place to an inner foe a sixteenth out. TRICOLOUR raced off of
the pace two to three wide, and failed to factor. T G'S NELSON got pinched back between horses at the start, and got outrun. THE RIDERS OF ALEBRIJE
AND RUNANDHIDE WIND CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF STAT FOR INTERFERECE IN THE EARLY STAGES; STAT WAS
SUBSEQUENTLY DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED THIRD.

READY TO POUNCE tracked along the inside, rallied along the rail to bid for the lead inside of a pair of rivals at the furlong pole, and drove clear. YES HE
CAN prompted the pace outside of SOUL STREIT while in the three path around the turn, led at the quarter pole, but was headed by a pair of rivals on
either side at the furlong grounds while hanging on his left lead, then reclaimed place from an outer hanging foe late. CHARGE THE LINE stalked the
leading pair around the turn, tipped to the five path turning for home, ranged up in upper stretch to produce a bid, led briefly in midstretch, but remained on
his left lead, got outkicked by an inner foe passing the furlong grounds, then hung for place. LEMON AND DIEM laid off of the pace in the three to four path
around the turn, and failed to factor. SOUL STREIT set the pace inside of a vying YES HE CAN while staying a path off of the inner railing around the turn,
but got headed by that foe at the quarter pole, and faded. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE got outrun.

O BESOS took a bump from an outer foe while put to a bit of tight quarters between horses at the start, laid off of the pace in the four path into the turn,
tucked down to the two path into the backstretch, gained inside of foes passing the five furlong pole, pressed two wide and between horses into the turn, bid
turning for home along with an outer INTREPID HEART, edged away from that foe passing the three sixteenths pole, but failed to kick on in the final furlong,
hung, but lasted via a very tight photo finish. INTREPID HEART broke step slowly at the start, stalked three wide, then four wide into the far turn, ranged up
outside of foes turning for home to bid outside of O BESOS entering the lane, briefly failed to keep pace with that foe passing the three-sixteenths, kept on
and came again in the final sixteenth as the leader hung, re-bid late, but missed. BOYFRIEND MATERIAL bumped an inner foe at the start, prompted the
pace along the inside, moved forward and led at the five furlong pole, showed the way from pressing rivals around the far turn, met a pair of bids entering
the lane, but gave way passing the quarter pole. NATE'S ATTACK trailed, swung from the three path to the five path turning for home, and moved up. AWE
SHACKLE showed the way two wide around the far turn, but got headed by an inner foe at the five furlong pole, pressed before being entering the far turn
three wide and between horses, then faded at the five sixteenths. MATH WIZARD tracked in the three path around the first turn, but failed to keep pace
between horses into the far turn, chased under a drive around that bend, but faded.

Footnotes
CRIMINAL DEFENSE stalked along the inside, tipped to the four path entering the lane to bid for the lead along with an outer SOUL COAXING, led from
that foe at the three sixteenths, and held firmly to the wire. SOUL COAXING stalked the clear leader from the three path, bid entering the lane while getting
floated to the five path, go outkicked by an inner foe at the three-sixteenths, but stayed latched on, sustained the battle through the final furlong, but was
denied. CHIEF CHEETAH saved ground off of the pace, and chased along the rail to claim show at the sixteenth pole. LONG AND STRONG sped clear
early on, showed the way in the two path, widened around the far turn, but came back to a pair of rivals entering the lane, yielded to those rivals at the three
sixteenths pole, and lost show a sixteenth from home. DREWPOWER was slow into stride and trailed the field around the first turn, moved between horses
approaching the half mile pole, tipped three wide into the far turn, then stayed on through the lane for a minor share. LEROY JENKINS raced far off of the
pace in the four path around the first turn, shifted six wide down the backstretch, improved a bit before taking the far turn five wide, then failed to menace
through the lane. RONITHELIMODRIVER broke a step slowly at the start, settled far off of the pace in the two path, took the far turn in the six path while at
the rear of the field, and moved up. FULL DINNER JACKET broke a step slowly at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, tucked five to four wide
into the far turn, got outmoved to trail the field at the five sixteenths, then passed a few tired foes in the lane. BIRTHDAY PARTY tracked three wide, but
tired through the lane. TOURIST'S DREAM tracked two wide and between horses, but came under strong urging among foes at the half mile pole, failed to
respond into the far turn, and weakened at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
BERTIE'S GALAXY set the pace along the inside, drew off at the quarter pole, was driven passing the furlong grounds, drifted outwardly entering the final
sixteenth as WIN YA WIN closed in, but lasted to the wire. WIN YA WIN laid off of the pace while under steady urging along the inside, shifted to the four
path in upper stretch rallied with a good kick to take aim on the clear drifting leader in the late stages, but missed reaching that foe on the wire. BINDING
AGREEMENT stalked along the inside, bid for place inside of foes at the three sixteenths pole, but was outkicked for that position at the furlong grounds.
SIR WELLINGTON prompted the pace setter from the outside, but faded entering the lane. ZELIG got a bit antsy waiting for the start, then was outrun.
