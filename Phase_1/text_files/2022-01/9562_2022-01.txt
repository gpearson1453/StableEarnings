Footnotes
MILLIGANMIKEANDME unhurried in the early going off the inside, began to advance in the three path midway on the final turn, came in the two path for the
drive, challenged inside a drifting leader inside the furlong marker, pulled clear under steady handling. COURTNEY FAY broke with the field, narrowly
showed the way into the first turn, shook clear in the two path far turn, drifted out when nearing midstretch while still clear, could not match the winner late,
lasted for the second spot. WAR MUSIC forwardly placed inside, tipped out three wide late first turn, prompted pace, continued three wide in the second
turn, closed the gap on the runner up late but was not up to outfinishing that one. GOLD STRATEGY settled off the pace and the inside, four wide onto the
backstretch, continued outside and raced four wide through the second turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a late kick. CHAI TEA void of speed
while four wide into the first turn, three wide the middle half, four wide again into the stretch when improving position, flattened out in the final furlong. HALF
SCOUT five wide into the first bend, five wide again through the second turn, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. JERI DAWN void of early
foot while five wide into the first turn, remained back the middle half then picked off some tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. ON A SHOESTRING
mid pack off the inside, raced in the two path second turn, raced in the two path second turn, tired in the drive. COURAGEOUS CAPPEN rank first turn,
continued forwardly placed while saving ground, also tired in the drive. FEMININE ALLURE remained always back. WAR SHOES moved closer before a
half, gave way while also racing along the inside.

Footnotes
A REAL JEWEL away in good order, raced behind the leaders while along the inside into the turn, in traffic through much of the bend while continuing along
the rail, switched to the outside when straightened for home, engaged the leader with a sixteenth remaining and wore that foe down under firm handling.
EMERALD PRINCESS broke on top, set the pace in the two path, shook clear in upper stretch, responded when tested late, gave ground grudgingly to the
winner. SUPER WONDER GIRL lacked early foot, raced three wide through the turn, encountered some traffic entering the stretch, along for the show late
while not a threat to the top pair. FIFTH RISK off a step slow, raced back off the pace, closer into the turn then raced behind traffic through the bend, clear
for the drive only to finish up evenly. DIXIE PENNY away well, pressured the runner up in the three path for four furlongs and had little left for the stretch
run. GUEST IN MY HEART within striking distance while racing outside, lacked a closing response through the stretch while remaining widest. LITTLE BIRD
FLASH stumbled at the start, remained back in failing to menace. OFF WE GO forwardly placed and four wide for a half, tired in the drive. VERKLEMPT off
a step slow, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DUTCH TREAT hesitated at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, continued back early, closer on the outside through the turn, four wide into the
lane, kicked down the leader to be edging clear late. EURO ME in the second flight into the turn outside, proceeded four wide through the bend when
inching closer, took over into the lane, well clear past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner, remained clear for the place. B'S LIL' BUMBLEBEE
in the second group while saving ground, in a bit tight late in the bend remaining inside, steered out steadily through upper and midstretch, up late for the
show. MOCHA KISS pressed the issue up the backstretch outside, continued four wide through much of the turn, came three wide into the stretch and
began to tire. TIGER BAIT in the second flight while between rivals, two path into the stretch, came up empty when called on through the lane. PRESLEY
set or forced the pace inside, also faltered in the drive. MY GRACE vied up front while between horses, gave way through the stretch as well. SUPERSTAR
BEA fell back to trail after the start, three wide trip, made little impact. PROUD VICTORIA with the pace while three wide and between horses, first to give in
late in the turn. ROSE MARIE B in the second flight two off the rail and between rivals, checked up in tight quarters early in the turn, fell back, moved out
four wide late in the bend, trailed home.

Footnotes
W W FITZY took control into the first turn, rated when clear up the backstretch, shrugged off a tepid bid by the runner up turning for home, maintained a
comfortable advantage to the wire under a firm left handed crop. MISS IMPERIAL six wide into the first turn when with the first flight, angled into be three
wide onto the backstretch, chased the winner the middle half mild, moved a bit closer with a tepid bid turning for home, proved no match in the drive.
BOBBIN TAIL bothered when put in tight just after the start, raced back off the pace inside, continued to save ground into and through the second bend, had
little for the top two through the stretch, drew clear of the others. DUPLICITOUS forwardly placed when four wide into the first turn, settled in the second
flight the middle part, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. IZZYBELLA in tight then steadied just after the break, settled toward the
inside, dropped all the way to the rail second turn and also went one paced through the stretch. INVALUABLE five down to four wide first turn, remained
back in failing to menace. CATECHISM four wide into the first turn, also had nothing for the drive. SHABAM broke out, was rank in some traffic in the first
turn, stopped in the second turn, jogged in while far back.

Footnotes
DR. FORMAN closest to the leader while just off the inside, continued to pursue that one up the backstretch, collared that rival at will entering the stretch,
quickly clear. SOMETHING NATURAL four wide through the first turn when racing in mid pack, two out to three wide when advancing through the second
turn, closest to the winner a furlong out, could do little with that rival to the wire, held sway for the place late. SPLASH FOR GOLD off a step slow, lacked
early foot, rallied three wide out of the final turn, finished clear of the others while slowly gaining for the place. LOVE NEST settled behind the pace off the
inside, raced four wide through the second turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing kick. FLATOUTJUSTICE behind the pace while steered
toward the inside first turn, saved ground through the second bend when with the second flight, came up empty for the stretch run. SO ALIVE lacked speed
just off the inside, remained in the two path second bend, displayed a mild amount of interest to improve position slightly in the drive. COACH ADAMS five
wide into the first turn, continued outside and was five wide into and through the second bend, also was found lacking when the real running began at the
head of the lane. MAJOR BROWN in some traffic into the first turn, dropped inside the middle half, saved ground second turn, remained back through the
lane. SEEK N JUSTICE away in good order, clear early, extended that advantage in the run up the backstretch, faltered when headed by the winner into the
stretch. THAT'S WHAT I SAY devoid of speed while four wide into the first turn, continued back, four wide again late in the second turn, failed to respond.
ALTITO was never involved. MEISTERMIND within striking distance early, began a steady fade before a half while three wide.

Footnotes
PEACE PEDDLER close from the start along the inside, showed the way into the turn, shook clear late in the turn, drew off through the lane under steady
handling. MADELYN'S MAGIC lacked speed, three wide into the far turn, floated out five wide turning for home, rallied down the middle of the strip to be
well clear for the place. DECADE OF DREAMS off a step slow, moved up outside, raced four wide through the turn, had nothing for the top two in the drive,
held the show. FIREWOLVES broke with the leaders, fell back off the pace off the inside, three wide through the turn when going evenly, continued one
paced through the stretch. XTREME GEM forwardly placed while three wide, came up empty when called on for the drive, outkicked for the show. TASHA
broke sharp, pressed the winner for a half from the outside, weakened in the drive. CAMPAIGNING settled in mid pack in the two path, had nothing for the
drive. ZMUDA in mid pack early outside, four out to five wide turning for home, also came up empty for the stretch run. MOST EMPRESSIVE off a step
slow, remained back. MUSE fell back to trail, showed little in remaining well back.

Footnotes
ESKENFORIT raced well back off the pace for five furlongs, dropped to the inside when advancing late in the final turn, challenged inside the leader, kicked
clear, kept to pressure. RED AGAIN chased the leader off the inside, advanced on that one in the second turn, carried out a bit by that same foe exiting that
bend, challenged three wide as the winner was lodging his bid turning for home, proved no match for that one, held the place late. VENTURE FORTH fell
back off the pace inside, continued to save ground into and through the second bend, rallied up the inside and was getting to the runner up late. DAVID'S
GEM away well, quickly sprinted well clear into the first turn, larger lead up the backstretch, got out a bit turning into the lane, began to weaken soon after
when headed by the top two. COAL TRUTH void of speed off the inside, raced four wide into the far turn, steered in a bit inside a tiring rival midway on the
final turn, improved into stretch and flattened out to finish up evenly. PEPPER PIKE off a step slow, trailed far back for six furlongs, angled out four wide
turning for home, improved position while not posing a serious threat. FIRST LINE off a step slow, was not a threat while racing outside. HOOKED A
GOODWIN four wide through both turns when running toward the front, began to tire in the second turn. CANADIAN GAME never a threat while racing two
path. KNIGHT'S CROSS in mid pack early, stopped after a half, fell far back and was distanced after losing contact with the field, jogged in. PER RULING
DATED 2/14/2022 RECEIVED FROM THE ARKANSAS RACING COMMISSION (RULING #2022-OP-11) FIRST LINE WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE
TEST.

Footnotes
CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK pressed the leader from the two path, tried that one from the outside turning into the lane, drove steadily clear. HEART RHYTHM
within striking distance while well wide, four path into the turn, three wide exiting, proved no match for the winner. EDGE TO EDGE with the early leaders
inside, lost some position while saving ground through the turn, moved out for the drive then came back for the show while not a threat to the top two.
MANHATTAN UP off a step slow, continued back in the turn, two path into the lane, shifted out then improved position with some late interest. HAPPYMAC
in the second flight toward the inside, moved closer in the two path entering the stretch, flattened out the final furlong. ONE FAST CAT settled in mid pack
off the inside, three wide through the turn, continued one paced through the lane to finish up evenly. FULL AUTHORITY narrowly set the pace up the
backstretch between horses, dropped a bit more toward the inside turn, faltered when headed by the winner exiting the turn. VULCAN remained back in
failing to threaten. SHACKLEFORD'S JOY fell back to trail after the start and was never involved. BLAME J D within striking distance while three wide,
continued off the inside turn, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
HOT AND SULTRY broke alertly, set all the pace in the two path, shook off a couple of foes turning for home, clear again, kept to task. LITTLE MOMBO
prompted the issue in the three path up the backstretch, advanced and lodged a brief bid outside the winner turning for home, proved no match, remained
clear for the second spot. HEARTYCONSTITUTION broke with the field, raced forwardly while covered up along the rail for a half, had little for the top two
late, clear of the others. BEGUINE in mid pack while racing outside, loomed a brief threat while four wide late in the turn, failed to sustain that advance in the
drive. CHESTERETTE went one paced throughout in the two path. THREAVE'S COMPANY off a step slow, passed a few tiring rivals while not a serious
threat. BICAMERAL saved ground to no avail. COMEDY ACT settled off the pace and the inside, three to four wide turn, came up empty for the drive.
FIVEDCONSCIENCENES off a step slow, trailed throughout. MAJESTIC FREEDOM off slowly, remained sluggish afterward and was soon pulled up after
losing contact with the field. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
