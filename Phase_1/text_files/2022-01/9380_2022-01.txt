Footnotes
TIZ LIGHT THE WAY tracked two wide, gained three wide around the far turn to bid for the lead entering the lane, repelled FREEDOM FACTOR's challenge
after forging an advantage at the three sixteenths pole, and drew clear. FREEDOM FACTOR saved ground off of the pace along the inside, inched forward
four wide around the far turn, gained to attempt a bid outside of TIZ LIGHT THE WAY in upper stretch, but failed to keep pace approaching the final furlong,
and chased that foe home to prove second best. UPHAM settled at the rear of the field in the two path around the first turn, took the far turn four wide before
getting floated five wide entering the lane, then rallied outside of foes through the final furlong to reach show on the wire. THE GREEN MO'STER stalked
the embattled leaders from the two path around the first turn, saved ground around the far turn while slipping into place, tipped two wide and bid for the lead
entering the lane while between horses, but was outkicked by a pair of outer bidding foes at the three-sixteenths, kept on, but was nailed on the wire for
show. MANGELSEN vied outside of DICTATOR around the first turn, cleared and crossed over approaching the five furlong pole, showed the way around
the far turn, but met a trio of bidders at the quarter pole, and weakened. MAYBERRY SALOON rated far off of the pace three wide, came into the lane four
wide, and failed to factor. GUITAR SLIM trailed around both turns, then passed tiring rivals. CONVICT PIKE raced far off of the pace two wide and between
horses, shifted three wide entering the lane, but tired. DICTATOR got fractious in the gate, vied inside of MANGELSEN around the first turn, rated back to
stalk outside of that foe entering the backstretch, but weakened around the far turn. REDOUX got antsy in the gate, tracked along the inside, but faded
around the far turn.

Footnotes
MISTER STRANGE set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pair of outer vying rivals around the far turn, gamely clung to an advantage
through upper stretch, and edged clear through the final furlong. CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT pressed the pace two wide, vied between horses around the far
turn, battled on through upper stretch, but was turned away at the furlong grounds. FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN stalked three wide, vied at the three furlong
pole, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterparts at the quarter pole, dug in for show at the three-sixteenths as DA GOLD ROOM loomed, but gamely
held that position to the wire. DA GOLD ROOM saved ground off of the pace, tracked the leading trio around the far turn before shifting four wide entering
the lane, bid for show at the three sixteenths pole, but wandered about while remaining on his left lead, and hung for that position. C F JOHNATHAN broke
a step slowly and shied from an outer foe at the start, then failed to make an impacct. TUNE MY GUITAR never got involved. MY LITTLE FLACO raced
forwardly placed four wide early on, but weakened at the half mile pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
CARTIER CAT tracked three wide, ranged up around the far turn, shifted inside of the drifting leader while completing a bid passing the quarter pole, drew
clear shortly after, and held sway from a chasing UNORTHODOX through the final furlong. UNORTHODOX settled at the rear along the inside, picked up
horses with a flourish while rallying four wide around the far turn, produced a bid while shifting to the six path to stay outside of a drifting FLYING FRED in
upper stretch, but was only second best. WAR LIGHT broke inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, raced at the rear two wide, shifted three wide entering
the lane, then altered course to the five path in midstretch to claim show, and chased the leading pair home. FLYING FRED bumped with an outer foe at the
start, set the pace along the inside, but was steered to the four path entering the lane, then got headed by a pair of rivals on either side soon after, lost show
at the furlong pole, and yielded. SCAT SHACK bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, raced close up in the two path around the first turn, lost position
down the backstretch after tucking to the rail, and failed to factor. HERO DRAGON tracked along the inside, but faded. COOL RUNNINGS took bumps from
rivals on either side at the start, pressed the pace three wide around the first turn, then two wide at the five furlong pole, but weakened between horses
entering the lane.

Footnotes
PICKNNGRINN set the pace inside of a trio of hounding foes, shook clear from a bidding COVE BLUE at the quarter pole, drew off in upper stretch, and
held from a rallying rival late. LAFITTE'S FLEET tracked along the inside, shifted four wide and between horses passing the quarter pole, gained place with
multiple lengths to find on the leader at the furlong grounds, sustained his rally late, but missed reeling that foe in on the wire. DINAR was briefly restless
awaiting the start, stalked three wide and between horses while prompting the pace, but failed to keep pace with the leaders entering the lane, shifted three
wide shortly after the quarter pole, and kept on to regain show at the sixteenth pole. FROLIC MORE raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, got
floated five wide entering the lane, lacked a punch to produce a bid, but outfinished rivals for a minor share. IRISH HOKIE took a bump from an inner foe at
the start, raced off of the pace three wide and outside of foes into the turn, got fanned six wide entering the lane, but failed to factor.
RICHIESGOTSWAGGER pressed the pace two wide and between horses, but faded approaching the quarter pole. COVE BLUE bumped the outer part of
the gate before bumping an outer rival at the start, recovered to press the pace four wide, attempted a bid passing the three furlong pole, but shifted
inwardly while failing to keep pace with the leader passing the quarter pole, and tired between horses through the final furlong.

Footnotes
RUN ROCKET tracked along the inside, came under a drive at the five sixteenths pole, shifted three wide into tight quarters at the quarter pole, bumped
with an outer CABO'S RUMOR at the three sixteenths, surged between rivals to claim place at the furlong pole with multiple lengths to find on the leader,
and sustained his rally to reel that foe in in the final sixteenth. CUSTOM BOBBY'S sped clear early on, managed a loose lead around the far turn, held sway
through upper stretch, but was worn down in the final sixteenth. CABO'S RUMOR stalked two wide, came under urging at the half mile pole after briefly
failing to keep pace between horses, tracked three wide around the far turn, got floated four wide by an inner shifting RUN ROCKET at the quarter pole,
bumped with that rival at the three sixteenths, then got outkicked by that foe at the furlong grounds, and kept on to secure a minor share. I'M D'CAT rated off
of the pace in the three to two path around the first turn, saved ground around the far turn, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, altered to the five path
passing the furlong grounds while hanging on his left lead, and stayed on late. LOUISIANA MOON saved ground far off of the pace, took the far turn in the
two path, shifted three wide approaching the final sixteenth while chasing, and improved between horses late. HENNING was unhurried three wide around
the first turn, gained four to five wide around the far turn, but leveled off late and failed to reach a minor share. UNRESTRICTED stalked along the inside,
then chased along the rail without bidding. SECRET VISTA broke a bit inwardly at the start, tracked the pace three wide, improved to two wide stalking
position behind the clear leader into the far turn, but faltered between horses at the furlong grounds. GRACIDA never got involved. TIN DELAY was outrun.
DATSWHATILIKE raced off of the pace in the five to four path around the first turn, then took the far turn in the three path before fading turning for home.

Footnotes
MISTY VEIL set the pace two wide around the first turn, then along the inside down the backstretch, inched away from the field while well in hand passing
the three furlong pole, drew off under moderate urging through midstretch, and was wrapped up through the late stages. MISS TULSA raced off of the pace
two wide, moved forward to stalk between horses approaching the half mile pole, brushed an inner rival while advancing inside of ANGEL OF VERDUN at
the five sixteenths, gained place passing the quarter pole, and chased the leader home to prove second best. DISTORTED VERVE got restless in the gate
awaiting the start, then broke outwardly, tracked three wide, gained place at the five sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by an inner foe for that position at
the quarter pole. SAINTSATION trailed in the three path around the first turn, took the far turn four wide, but failed to factor. ANGEL OF VERDUN stalked
three to two wide, but faded between horses at the five sixteenths pole. SWEET BLINDNESS laid close up along the inside into the first turn, rated back to
stalk around that bend, but steadied when brushed and put to tight quarters by an outer rival passing the five sixteenths pole, and failed to re-rally. THE
RIDER OF SWEET BLINDNESS CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF MISS TULSA FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE FIVE SIXTEENTHS POLE,
BUT IT WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
NET A BEAR took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, tracked the pace two wide around the first turn, moved forward to claim an inside stalking
position into the backstretch, hunted the leading trio from the pocket around the far turn, tipped four wide entering the lane, rallied to bid outside of
BLESSED ANNA approaching the furlong grounds, forged an advantage at that junction, and drew clear through the final sixteenth. BLESSED ANNA
bumped an inner foe at the start, tracked in the five to four path around the first turn, improved to a three wide stalking position at the five furlong pole, bid
outside of the leading pair at the five sixteenths pole, forged an advantage at the three sixteenths marker, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the furlong
grounds, and proved second best. OFFSPRING saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, passed tiring foes to claim show at
the sixteenth pole, and held that position from an outer rival late. ALLIACEOUS trailed around both turns, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and
moved up, but was denied show. WINNING ROMANCE got fractious in the gates awaiting the start, set the pace along the inside, met a pair of bids around
the far turn, but yielded at the three sixteenths pole, and tired thereafter. MONEY WELL SPENT stalked two wide, vied between horses around the far turn,
but weakened passing the three sixteenths pole. DANCE AWAY bumped an outer foe at the start, tracked in the four to three path around the first turn, lost
position into the backstretch, then shifted from the three to four path around the far turn, but lacked a rally, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
CREOLE BABY stalked two wide, grinded away at the tiring leader's advantage in the final furlong while hanging on her left lead, and got up in the final
sixteenth. STELLA LINK set the pace inside of a sternly pressing TUGBOAT got headed by that foe at the three furlong pole, but reclaimed an advantage at
the quarter pole as that foe lugged out entering the lane, held sway through midstretch while tiring, but was worn down in the final sixteenth. ANSLIE'S
GUMDROP broke a step slowly, raced off of the pace in the three path around the turn, and stayed on while mildly progressing through the lane. TUGBOAT
vied two wide, led at the three furlong pole, but failed to kick on due to lugging outwardly entering the lane, got headed by her inner counterpart at the
quarter pole, continued to drift out through upper stretch, but straightened out at the furlong grounds, and kept on to save a minor share. JIG TIME BANDIT
balked at the starting gate when loading, then hesitated at the start, trailed the field in the four path around the turn, altered course to the eight path in upper
stretch, and improved. LOOKING HOT rated far back two wide, and moved up. MISS LAUGHALOT raced far off of the pace three wide, shifted five wide
entering the lane, but failed to threaten. LA LOLA tracked four wide from midpack, but faded through the lane. JULIA'S CHANCE chased along the inside,
but weakened after a quarter mile. SAVANNAH'S HERE steadied between horses a few strides after the start, recovered to race in midpack three wide, but
weakened turning for home.
