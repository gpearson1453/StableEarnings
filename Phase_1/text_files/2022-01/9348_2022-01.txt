turn, rallied to the front with a sixteenth remaining and got nailed at the wire. COULTHARD (IRE) was off a bit slow from inside, went up to take control early
with company to the outside, cleared that rivals leaving the turn, held a short lead into deep stretch but yielded to the to pair and saved the show. CARIBOU
CLUB stalked outside a pair of rivals then came four wide into the drive, bid between foes in upper stretch but went evenly late. EXULTATION tracked the

path. CREW DRAGON broke a bit slow, settled off the rail, came five wide into the lane, bid three deep in upper stretch but faltered in the late stages.
PERFECTIONISTIC raced off the rail then moved to the two path for the turn, angled five wide leaving the bend, angled out further in upper stretch and
never threatened. EASTERN OCEAN was off a bit slow, stalked the pace from inside, bumped with rival into the turn, saved ground to the stretch and
flattened out. ULTIMATE BANGO saved ground through the turn, tipped out into the lane, lacked room in upper stretch and could not rally once gaining a

Footnotes
SHE'S BULLETPROOF was off slow from inside, advanced up the backstretch, came out and bumped MADIHA in upper stretch, reached the front
approaching the sixteenth pole and drove clear. MADIHA tracked from off the rail, went three deep or three wide on the turn, got bumped by SHE'S
BULLETPROOF in upper stretch and was outkicked by the rival in the furlong grounds. EXACTLY WENDY sat off the pace early on, got shuffled between
rivals at the seven-sixteenths pole, angled four wide around the turn and was along for the show. YOUTE came away to a slow beginning, steadied briefly
when intimidated by outside rival jumping shadows, angled to the inside and saved ground off the pace, finished well under minor asking in the lane and
came out late to earn a minor award. INCREASE STAKES dueled for the lead into and around the turn, battled to deep stretch but flattened late. ROUBAIX
dueled from inside to the stretch, fought to the sixteenth pole and also flattened. SHE'S A BIT SASSY broke slow, tracked two wide around the bend and
lacked a rally. COPPER BO TEN jumped a shadow early prior to the dirt crossing, chased three wide around the bend and never made an impact. SQUARE
FUN stalked the pace from inside, chased from the rail position to the stretch and weakened. FINGER TIP stalked the pace outside a rival, two wide on the
turn and weakened.

Footnotes
EDGEWAY set the pace under pressure from outside, led two wide into the turn, cleared past the quarter pole and inched away under urging. MERNEITH
pressed the pace from outside, three wide into the turn, lost contact past the quarter pole and chased two wide into the stretch, stayed on through the lane
and was clearly second best. STELLAR SOUND broke a step slow, chased the top pair early then went up to attend the pace from outside, traveled four
then three wide on the turn, weakened in the lane and saved the show. QUEENGOL saved ground trailing around the bend and failed to threaten.

THAT'S AMARE stalked along the inside then two wide into the stretch, tipped outside the top pair in upper stretch, cleared with a furlong remaining and
held safely. TAMING THE TIGRESS traveled between foes off the pace, had to pause while on heels at the half-mile pole, angled four wide into the lane,
rallied and could not threaten the winner late but held the place. BELLA D dropped back to last early, went two then three wide around the turn, steered out
at the top of the lane and finished well. RIGHTEOUSLY tracked from between runners early, was a bit crowded into the turn and lost some ground, entered
the lane two wide, came out n upper stretch but got hemmed in at the eight pole, shifted in a bit to a clear path and kept to fill out the superfecta. VA VA
VOOM dueled for the lead from inside to the eighth pole and weakened. SATURDAY HEIST dueled for command from outside to the furlong marker and
gave in. KEEP YOUR COIL stalked the pacesetters outside a rival, went four then three wide around the bend and weakened. QUEEN MOLOTOV stumbled
badly at the start, angled to the inside and advanced to mid-pack, saved ground to the stretch and flattened in the lane. ACAI tracked off the rail then moved
into the two path, remained two wide to the stretch and faded. PREMIUMONSATURDAY settled outside a pair of rivals early, took the turn three wide and
tired.

Footnotes
TIZ A MASTER set the pace with BUSY PAYNTER alongside, maintained a short lead over that rival through the lane and edged clear late. BUSY
PAYNTER was fractious in the gate, brushed from inside at the start but was still off alertly, prompted the pace from outside into and around the turn, kept
the pressure on to deep stretch but could not find the needed late kick. ROLINGA bobbled at the start, sat off the pace early on, was coaxed along through
the turn, asked two wide into the stretch, steered out with a furlong remaining and finished willingly for the show honors. IT'S A RIDDLE chased the top pair
three wide around the bend and failed to summon a late bid. TRULY FABULOUS stumbled sharply and came out at the start dropping back early, went five
wide around the turn and failed to threaten. YOUR ROYAL COIL brushed rival leaving the gate, chased off the pace, lacked room into the turn and shifted
out to the three path, entered the lane two wide and failed to make an impact. WARREN'S MEMORABLE chased outside rivals up the backstretch, took the
turn four wide and weakened in the stretch run. BRIO IS AWESOME tracked the leaders from inside, dropped back around the turn, was bothered a bit late
on the bend and tired.

HEAD START pressed the pace from outside, headed rival at the five-sixteenths pole, took over with a quarter mile remaining, cleared leaving the bend and
powered away. NANG SINGHA broke in and bumped SO SOFTLY in the beginning, went four then three wide on the turn, steered to the inside in the
stretch and bested the rest. SO SOFTLY got bumped at the start, placed into a good position stalking the two path, could not summon the needed late kick
in the drive and got edged for the place three deep late. MIDNIGHT'S GIRL was fractious in the gate, set the pace under pressure, headed by rival at the
five-sixteenths pole, lost the lead approaching the quarter pole and weakened in the final furlong. SAI PHAR broke out and bumped rival, traveled two wide
into the turn while off the pace, went three to four wide into the drive and failed to respond. LONELY ON TOP bumped twice with inner rival at the start, went
four wide into the turn, angled down to the two path and failed to menace. BELLE MY BELLE got pinballed between rivals at the start, tracked three wide
into the lane and came up empty. TROPICANA GIRL got bumped and lost her path leaving the gate, saved ground through the turn and had little left for the
drive.

BELLABEL (IRE) stalked the pace in the two path, bid three deep on the second bend, kicked clear from inside rivals and inched away under urging.
SHOPPINGFORPHAROAH came away well from outside, cleared and steered to the rail, showed the way up the backstretch, tested by HELENS WELL
(IRE) midway around the far turn, vied with rivals into the drive, lost command in upper stretch and held the place. HELENS WELL (IRE) stalked the pace
two wide, bid outside with five-sixteenths remaining, vied between rivals into the lane, got outkicked in upper stretch but stayed on through the final furlong.
FUENTE OVEJUNA (GB) was off slow and impeded start, allowed to settle at the back in the two path, raced off the rail to the second bend, entered the
stretch two wide and could not rally. FORTUNATA TENSIO stumbled and broke out, bumped with MISS BELLATRIX soon after, stalked along the inside,
hugged the rail into the stretch and weakened. MISS BELLATRIX lacked room, bumped with inner rival and steadied early, moved to the inside, lacked
room and checked past the five-sixteenths pole and tired.

AMERICAN THEOREM took control quickly, set the pace inside a rival up the backstretch, cleared at the five-sixteenths pole and remained strong to the
wire under hand urging. SHOOTERS SHOOT stalked the pacesetter from inside, tipped out on the second bend and took aim two wide into the stretch,
could not summon the needed late kick but bested the rest. DIVINE ARMOR stalked the pace in the two path between foes on the first turn, raced between
on the far turn then angled in with a quarter mile remaining and gained the show. MONGOLIAN WIND went four then three wide around the first turn,
prompted the pace from outside, lost contact with five-sixteenths remaining, raced between foes in the stretch and kept on through the final furlong. WHO'S
THE STAR tracked the pace off the rail, angled out and advanced four wide on the far turn, moved into the three path leaving the bend but flattened out in
the final furlong. SECRET TOUCH raced three deep around the first turn, tracked widest up the backstretch, remained outside a pair of rivals into the
second bend, came three wide into the drive, tired and eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
CABO SPIRIT tucked inside on the first turn, rated in mid-pack up the backstretch, angled three wide into the lane, bumped rival in upper stretch, rallied and
drove clear late. MAGLEV (IRE) hesitated and broke slow, raced two wide then moved inside, lacked room on the far turn, saved ground to the stretch,
tipped off the rail then angled back in with a furlong remaining, rallied up the inside but was bested by the winner. HANDY DANDY got crowded a bit
between foes early, stalked three then two wide on the first turn, took aim three wide entering the stretch, put in a bid in upper stretch but got outkicked by
the top pair. BALLY'S CHARM pressed the pace from outside then took over on the backstretch, dueled into and around the far turn, lost command nearing
the sixteenth pole and steadied when bothered late. BARSABAS stalked in the two path, was put in tight quarters between rivals at the top of the stretch,
kept to task through the final furlong but failed to threaten. DERECHO DANDY brushed BOISE leaving the gate, settled in mid-pack outside a rival, angled
four wide into the stretch, bumped with the winner in upper stretch and faltered in the furlong grounds. BOISE got brushed from outside at the start, moved
to the inside then two wide into the backstretch, raced between foes into the second bend, swung five wide exiting the turn and lacked the needed rally.
C'MON MAN unhurried early on, went three wide around the first turn, traveled three deep into the second bend, came four wide into the stretch and was
not a factor. STREET ART sped to the front from inside, was rated on the front end then dueled with BALLY'S CHARM to the stretch, had his path taken
nearing the eighth pole and faded.
