Footnotes
THE BIG SHOW vied for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the home stretch and drove clear before the wire. PRIME CODE
challenged for the early lead, saved ground around the final turn, dueled down the lane, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. SAMURAI
ISLAND raced within striking distance and followed the top two to the wire. SHOETRICK raced near the back in the beginning, came around the first turn on
the outside, made a mild bid, but was no factor. BIG JABOT raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the second turn and put forth an even
effort. PAPA JR hopped at the start, racing near the back and was never a threat. JR'S PACIFICO lacked early speed and showed little.

OUR LITTLE GIRL pressed the pace, racing outside around the first turn, moved up, took command, pulled away and won handily. CUSTOM MAIDEN
unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the inside around the final turn, angled out, made an outside bid, proved no match for the winner, but was best of
others. KAITLYN'S COURT raced in the middle of the field, made a late bid and proved no match for the top two. CABEZA DE TORTUGA challenged for
the early lead, raced outside around the final turn and faded, while finishing wide. LANDWOMAN'S GIFT void of early speed, showed late interest, but was
no factor. MY DEPOSIT raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. LOCO POCO dueled on the front end, drove clear, saved ground around the
final turn and faded. SHOTGUN ANNIE pressed the early pace and dropped back.

Footnotes
BOLD THIRST pressed the pace, raced close throughout, took the lead, was all out and held on for the win. LANGS DAY void of early speed, moved up on
the outside around the final turn, rallied and needed more ground. SARCASTIC TONE pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished
by the top two. MOCITO ROJO raced near the back, made a bid around the final turn and hung. EXTIRPATOR went to the front, drove clear, saved ground
and faded. GOTTA GO lacked early speed and was never a threat.

YANK CRIME stalked the leader in the early going, made a bid around the final turn, took command, pulled away and won handily. STEAL IT BACK raced
within contention, came around the second turn on the outside, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. HIP FOUR O FOUR raced in the
middle of the field, made a late bid and proved no match for the top two. DRIVER broke through gates, raced in the back of the pack in the beginning,
showed late interest, but was no factor. HOPE FOR CHANGE lacked early speed, raced wide around the first turn, improved position, but was no factor. MY
BOY GUS shot to the front, drove clear, saved ground and faded. BREWSTER raced in the middle of the field and weakened. BOBBY BOOTS lacked early
speed and showed little. THIRTYEIGHT broke throughout the gates, raced within striking distance and dropped back.

Footnotes
ROCK ON COWBOY dueled on the front end, took the lead around the final turn, drove clear down the lane and was kept to the task. FLASHBURN raced
within contention, moved up, three wide around the final turn, proved no match for the winner, but held off a late running SIR POKERFACE for second. SIR
POKERFACE lacked early speed, raced outside around the second turn, rallied and was outfinished for second. ALIGNED INTEREST raced in the middle
of the field, made a bid and hung. MY TY FU PEG void of early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. SAILING JETT dueled on the front end and
was finished early. HOT LE ROY pressed the early pace and made a steady retreat. ONE PROUD BOY lacked early speed and showed little. SLOW raced
near the middle of the field in the beginning, came around the first turn five wide and dropped to the back.
