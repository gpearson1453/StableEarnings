Footnotes
AWFULLY FOXY edged up between runners near the half mile marker, went on the attack two wide outside the leader mid turn, dueled near the quarter
pole, seized command in upper stretch, shook clear under a drive past the three sixteenths and steadily widened with good energy to the wire. COMBAT
QUEEN had speed inside then rated back off the leader, attempted to angled out but was hemmed in nearing the turn, stalked inside, altered out in mid
stretch and gave game chase to the finish. ITALIAN DRESSING settled back early but well within range, eased off the inside mid turn, took closer order
three wide into the lane, was fanned out a bit wider by COMBAT QUEEN soon after then flattened out through the final furlong. PRACTICALLY DIZZY sped
clear early, dropped in and set the pace, met the winner's bid near the five sixteenths, sparred into the lane then weakened in the final sixteenth. BOURBON
WILDCAT was taken back at the start, edged up four wide nearing the half mile marker, pursued three wide mid turn then tired through the lane.

AL LOVES JOSIE sped clear early and secured the rail, set a rated pace, took some pressure into the turn, moved clear soon after, spurted away into the
lane, widened under some right handed asking past mid stretch then cruised home under mild encouragement through the final seventy yards. UNCLE
BUDDY broke a step slow, was hustled up to contention nearing the five eighths, tracked then dropped back leaving the far turn, shifted off the rail nearing
the quarter pole then came back willingly to earn the place. LANTAU prompted the pace outside the winner, bid to apply more pressure into the turn, saw
the winner get away mid turn, gave willing chase past the furlong grounds then faded late. KNOWHOWIKNOW , sluggish from the gate, dropped back near
the three eighths, angled five wide approaching the quarter pole but came up empty. WORLD OF FOOLS , between rivals near the five eighths, shifted in
around the turn. DR. GRANT, off the pace, raced three to four wide into the lane and failed to menace

Footnotes
MAD GENIUS sped to the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail and drew out through the stretch while under pressure. REMEMBERING WILBUR ,
four deep mid way on the turn, angled in a bit entering the stretch, raced in the three path and had a mild rally between rivals. CAPTAIN QUINT raced in the
two path on the turn and finished willingly inside horses. WINSTON'S GOLD ,a forward factor in the three path around the turn, drifted out a bit upper
stretch, raced on his left lead and weakened late. HAMPDEN LANE , fractious in the starting gate, hugged the inner rail on the turn and was not a threat.
HOLY SYNCHRONICITY , bumped hard by DR RAGS when that one was forced out leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail, chased the pace
and weakened in the the final furlong. VINNY , in the three path on the turn, was not a factor. BOSS MAN J J bumped DR RAGS when bearing out at the
break, was outrun and swung very wide leaving the turn. TUCKER ROAD bobbled leaving the starting gate and was not a factor. DR RAGS bumped HOLY
SYNCHRONICITY when soundly bumped and forced out by BOSS MAN J J leaving the starting gate, failed to be a factor and was eased late.

TREASURE TROVE broke a step slow then settled back while inside, quickly gained while saving ground past the five eighths then took aim on a battle on
the front end, awaited room as five rivals fought on near the five sixteenths, remained stalled to about the quarter pole, eased out then responded when
given his cue soon into the stretch, advanced between runners past the three sixteenths, leveled off to a strong stride past the furlong grounds, forged to
command with a sixteenth to go and drove clear. CLOSER LOOK , taken to rate early, advanced with and to the outside of the winner near the five eighths,
shifted out and bid five deep to engage the embattled leaders near the five sixteenths, kicked clear soon into the lane, drifted in towards the rail and gave
way grudgingly. AIN'T DA BEER COLD was sent inside to a clear early lead, was joined by a pair of rivals past the three quarter pole, dueled inside four
others leaving the five sixteenths, stayed on nicely past mid stretch and kept trying to the wire. BUMPERDOO settled well back as multiple rivals contested
the pace, swung five wide into the lane, straightened and had belated action. CARIBBEAN (AUS) , off the pace, angled well wide near the quarter pole but
came up empty. UP AGAINST IT , under a snug hold of a dueling trio early on, angled out and was sent up four wide to join the pace fray, disputed the
issue past the five sixteenths, shifted out soon into the stretch and gave way. DAVIDIC LINE , three deep early and with the pace, battled between foes from
the half mile marker, failed to kick on nearing the quarter pole and weakened. PLAMEN , two wide between runners while sparring, continued a pace
presence to about the quarter pole then surrendered.

Footnotes
STRIKING A POSE lacked speed, raced two wide on the turn, was taken to the five path turning for home, closed relentlessly, took command about sixty
yards from the finish and drew out. DISPUTED NOTION stalked the pace down the backstretch, gained a two wide lead leaving the turn, raced along the rail
in the stretch, finished willingly but was no match for the winner. IRISHMAN circled foes on the turn, floated to the six path in upper stretch and lacked a
serious response. ELVIRUS set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead leaving the turn and steadily retreated through the lane. TYLER TIME , three wide
chasing the pace on the turn, faltered. MAXIMO STRONG , stoutly rated down the backstretch, raced along the inner rail on the turn, faltered and was
eased late.

Footnotes
MOJOVATION , bumped at the break, settled off the pace and behind a trio of rivals, swung out very wide into the lane, leveled off when put to firm asking
past the three sixteenths, forged to command near the sixteenth marker and drew out nicely under a drive. ALL THREES , between rivals while not far back,
was under coaxing mid turn, checked off heels entering the lane, altered in, worked between runners past mid stretch and kept on gamely to earn the place.
FORCED sped to the front, set a rated pace towards the inside, moved away a bit past the five sixteenths, was guided three wide into the stretch, remained
clear under a drive past mid stretch, wandered outward and gave way grudgingly. KARAN'S NOTION prompted the pace between runners, stalked two to
three wide past the three sixteenths, moved out wider to pursue near mid stretch and kept on willingly. MONEY RIDE , three deep chasing the pace, shifted
out five wide for the drive and continued with effort. HE'S A SHOOTER saved ground, was under pressure inside rivals mid turn and faded. JOVIS tracked
the pace three deep early on, was under asking mid turn, failed to kick on, faltered leaving the three sixteenths and was eased late.

was under urging in mid stretch and drew away. ILLUSION OF HOPE prompted the pace down the backstretch, gained a two wide lead mid way on the
turn, weakened and held the place. DERBY JULEP , steady in traffic inside the five eighths pole, swung five wide leaving the turn and rallied outside. HEIDI
T bore out at the break, rushed up along the inner rail to gain a short lead leaving the backstretch, remained along the rail and faded in the drive. BELLIFY ,
along the inner rail on the turn, lacked a rally. SUMMER MUSIC , bumped by HEIDI T leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail on the turn and
weakened. INSTPARTY , outrun, swung to the six path leaving the turn.
