Footnotes
NOT THAT SERIOUS was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore soon after and drew off with something
left. TWO GUNS lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with good energy to gain the place. THE
MET settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished willingly. MONGOLIAN MEMORY was forwardly
placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. CHROME KING was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn
and was not a factor. AFTER THE CANDY dueled for the lead from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and weakened
through the final furlong. PROFOUND ONE broke sharply to press the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. ABRAAJ MIRAGE
stumbled at the start and unseated his rider.

VINTAGE KITTEN lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a quarter to run, opened a clear margin in mid-stretch
and was ridden out to the wire. LAUNCH PAD settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, could not gain on the winner in the
drive but finished with a steady bid. COMPLICATE broke sharply to press the pace of CIBERTRUCK while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that foe
nearing the five-sixteenths pole and gave way in the drive. MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second
turn and gave way in the drive. CIBERTRUCK sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way after going three-quarters.
CAPITAL CALL settled off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakended. SKY CONFIDENTIAL raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide
through the second turn and weakened. MARICOPA COUNTY showed no early speed, saved ground throughout and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FOUNDATION broke sharply to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off as an easy winner. MISS
REBEKAH was away in good order to press the pace of the winner from the inside, was no match for that rival in the drive but finished well to hold the place.
LEMON DROP LADY was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and lacked the needed late response. GOLDEN SUN DROPS was off a step
slow, rushed to contend and gave way in the drive. BUBBAS STREET GAL lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out further into the
stretch and finished with some later run. BACK TO BUSINESS was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not threaten.. O SHUGAH
MINT lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. QUEENS RANSOM settled off the leaders from between foes, moved
three-wide through the turn and weakened. ROBINSON BLUE showed no early speed, raced eighth-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. LIL'
MISS MISCHIEF raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.
