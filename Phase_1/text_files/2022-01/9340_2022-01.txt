Footnotes
DEFAULT PROTECTION tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up to make a bid near the half-mile pole, vied in the three path on the turn, took the lead
at the five-sixteenths, responded well when set down into upper stretch, kicked clear under one light tap of a down-turned crop outside the furlong marker
then powered away under a brisk hand ride to prove much the best. INTENSE HONOR came inward at the start, angled out significantly early, was coaxed
along on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and proved no match for the winner while just able to get
the place. SCHOOL OF THOUGHT angled in towards the back early, settled under some urging, raced inside to the two path under stronger
encouragement on the turn, bumped with a foe while coming between horses late and just missed the place while up for the show. FLOWER MOON
displayed good speed, remained well out in the track leaving the chute, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside of the winner in the two path on
the turn, lost the lead at the five-sixteenths and weakened then bumped with a foe late and missed the trifecta. PRECIPITATE dropped well behind under
urging, went around the turn in the three path and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
MO MISCHIEF hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home,
edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing late threat and held safe to prevail. MASKED MARAUDER coaxed from the start, chased
along the inside until tipped to the two path nearing the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, rallied along the inside through the stretch
latching on the aforementioned foe in the final jumps but was ultimately repelled to the wire. HALPERT chased just off the inside in aim of the leader, took
an awkward stride just outside the nine-sixteenths, the rider very briefly taking hold, got coaxed along through the turn and continued just off the inside into
upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. FOREST SPIRIT chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths and weakened in the late
stages. BRUNATE broke open the stall door prior to the start when growing a bit fractious, chased three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung
four wide for home and weakened. HANGAR ONE got bumped at the start by RUN CASPER RUN, who broke inwards, chased four to five wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and weakened. RUN CASPER RUN broke in at the start bumping HANGAR ONE and was
taken hold of briefly, chased five then four wide coaxed along from midway on the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
GALLINA bumped soundly with a rival at the start then checked, was urged along at the rear, went around most of the turn in the two path then shifted three
wide, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly under a left-handed crop, took the lead inside the furlong marker, shook clear into the final sixteenth
then was eased up while much the best. TALENTI moved up under urging to dispute the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, was
asked near the five-sixteenths, fought on well into the final furlong, was collared by her stablemate shortly thereafter and proved no match while clear for the
place. VIVAZANO was taken up when put in tight quarters near the three-quarter pole, settled off the pace, saved ground while roused on the turn, shifted
three wide while behind a foe into upper stretch, was put to a drive inside the three-sixteenths, moved out into the final sixteenth and improved for the show.
JULIANA'S ROSE showed early speed, angled in near the three-quarter pole and put VIVAZANO in tight, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the two
path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong and tired. PHENOMENAL WOMAN bumped with a rival at the
start, was carried in near the three-quarter pole, dropped off the pace under urging, went around most of the turn in the two path then moved to the rail and
lacked the needed response. SALUKI was urged along on the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, spun six wide into
the stretch and came up empty. FROSTED BOURBON was hustled from the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and
capitulated. MADAME ROSE was restless in the gate, bumped soundly with foes on both sides at the start, was urged along towards the rear, dropped back
three wide on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
CONSTITUTIONLAWYER went to the front, set the pace in the two path through solid fractions, inched away on the far turn, spun three wide into the
stretch, responded well under pressure in the drive, drifted in into the final furlong and proved best under strong urging. LONG TERM went four then three
wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, passed the nine-sixteenths under urging, chased in the three path around the far turn, dropped inward
into upper stretch, pursued the winner into the final furlong, moved out around the sixteenth-pole and weakened while well clear for the place.
ROOKIEOFTHEYEAR dropped back while asked early, saved ground on the first turn, was urged along at the rear, raced inside for most of the far turn,
went around a foe at the five-sixteenths then dropped back to the rail, turned into upper stretch under the crop and was along for the show. ORDER OF
MAGNITUDE was bumped soundly at the start, went around the first turn in the three path, was ridden along on the backstretch and intermittently put to the
crop, went three to four wide on the final turn and failed to threaten. UNION LIGHTS went three then two wide on the first turn, was well placed just off the
pace, dropped back under urging late on the backstretch, raced inside on the far turn and faltered then was eased but walked off. PERFECT FLIGHT broke
in and bumped hard with a foe, traveled around the first turn in the three path, settled outside under light urging, dropped back under stronger
encouragement late on the backstretch and faltered then was pulled up on the far turn before being subsequently vanned off.

BUSTIN BAY four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn, came under light and brief coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung three wide into upper stretch advancing quickly to take command straightened away, surged clear under a drive and was geared down in the late
stages to the finish. FAIR REGIS chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, proved no match for the
top one while improving position for the place honors. OK HONEY six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four then three wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. DIVA BANKER five to six paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked four to five wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and
weakened. QUALITY STONES dueled from the two path with VIOLENT POINT to her outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide
into upper stretch and was overhauled in tandem with her main pace foe by the eventual winner, then tired to the finish. VIOLENT POINT hustled from the
gate, dueled from the three path with the aforementioned foe to her inside, got let out spinning four to five wide into upper stretch and was displaced from
the front in concert with her main pace foe, then backed away to the finish. MY GIRL ANNIE chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and tired. ALLURE FORTUNE five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went
six wide into upper stretch and faltered.

a clear opening along the rail to make a bid into upper stretch, gained the lead outside the furlong marker, drifted out under a left-handed crop while moving
clear outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best under steady urging. BIG TONY'S GIRL bumped with a rival at the start while brushing with another foe
then was checked while pinched back, was urged along at the rear on the outside, rounded the turn in the three path, was driven six wide into the stretch
and improved for the place. QUEENTIGUA was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three then four path on the turn, took the
lead while five wide into the stretch, lost the advantage to the winner inside the three-sixteenths and weakened but was clear for the show. MISSION TRAIL
broke out and bumped with a foe then was taken up with a snatch of the left-rein, raced at the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn, came three wide
into the stretch, moved out near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. TOOTSIE'S SONG was well placed just off the pace, chased three
then four wide on the turn and came up empty. BETTY'S SMILE brushed with a rival at the start, was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn
and had nothing left. TANGOBERG showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied inside to the two path on the turn, lost the lead
coming to the quarter-pole and faded.

Footnotes
BANK STING established the front just after the start and showed the way four paths off the inside under pressure from LETMETAKETHISCALL outside
and ELOQUENT SPEAKER inside until the five-eighths, then got engaged head to head and dueled with ELOQUENT SPEAKER from that point onward
getting briefly nosed near the three-eighths before taking back narrow command at that station, got set down spinning four wide for home and was displaced
from the front straightened away and shaken off a bit nearing the eighth pole, dug in under a drive ranging up and knocking heads to the finish in game
fashion while widening away in concert with her main danger and was up inside the final seventy yards to prevail. ELOQUENT SPEAKER coaxed from the
start, applied pressure early on to BANK STING before advancing to duel five furlongs from home to that rival's inside, traded the front through the turn
getting put to coaxing five-sixteenths out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, took over straightened away and shook away briefly before being
confronted once more, dug in fighting on game and clinging to the front widening away as a tandem, got headed seventy yards from home and was
ultimately bested at the end while well clear of the rest. COURAGEOUS GIRL four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung four wide for home and weakened while along for the show honors. LETMETAKETHISCALL coaxed from the gate, raced five paths off the inside
down the backstretch applying some pressure to the leader early on, tucked three wide through the turn, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened.
AWILLAWAY chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
FORTY TWO ACE set the clear pace, controlled the action near the rail on the turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, drew off under the crop
into the final sixteenth then was eased up in the final forty yards while much the best. BOHEMIAN RUBY broke in and bumped with a foe, moved up with
five furlongs to run then chased the pace, saved ground on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch and narrowly earned the place while no match for
the winner. TUESDAY'S CHILD tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and tired then
just missed the place while able to get the show. FORESTWOOD LANE settled on the outside, was urged five then six wide on the turn and lacked the
needed response. ARROWHEART brushed with a foe at the start, was coaxed along off the pace, went four then five wide under stronger encouragement
on the turn and came up empty. CROCK OF GOLD raced just off the pace, chased while moving from the two path to the four path on the turn and
capitulated. V PATTERN brushed the outside of the gate at the start then brushed with an opponent, settled off the pace, was asked in the three path with
three furlongs to run, moved to five wide late on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BELL BOY settled under some urging,
went five to six wide on the turn and was no factor. UNLIKELY bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, moved up under urging then chased the
pace, raced between horses passing the nine-sixteenths, dropped back along the rail on the turn, moved to the two path before the quarter-pole and
retreated. ARTIE'S LIT was urged along towards the rear, went four wide on the turn and failed to respond.
