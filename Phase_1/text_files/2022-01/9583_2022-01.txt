AIN'T MISBEHAVIN was well rated throughout, came into the stretch three wide while in range, shifted out four wide when straightened for aim on the front
runners, closed well to get up late and edge clear under confident handling. VOUCH vied for the early lead on the inside, then rated off the pace down the
backstretch, made a three wide bid on the turn to be in between rivals by the five sixteenths, then regained the lead in the furlong grounds but was caught in
deep stretch, good effort. THUNDER GRUNDER was allowed to settle early, made a bid four wide move on the turn to take over on the turn, but flattened
out in the final furlong, bested rest. CATTLE DRIVE was reserved early while five wide down the backstretch, then came seven wide into the drive and
finished evenly. MAIN COOL CAT was void of early speed, then passed the tiring rivals on the inside. MESSY BAKER vied for the early lead three wide,
then made a bid to set the pace down the backstretch and gave way on the turn. ESKENFORTIME was settled back early on the inside, came three wide
into the drive and had no rally. DIAMOND SETTER dropped back. HIT THE TICKET was reserved early, raced six wide on the backstretch and tired.

the drive and finished willingly to be clearly second best. AFRICAN SONG was void of early speed, came three wide into the drive and offered a belated
rally to clearly best the rest. ALDINA was settled early and getting off the inside, was five wide down the backstretch and roused left handed while racing
erratically, then was roused again left handed nearing the three eighths and tried to get out, then lacked a rally while under strong left handed crop urging. R

Footnotes
PICTOR was away alertly and soon clear to set the pace while clear, then drew out leaving the turn and was kept to his task to prove best while clear.
CHEEK TO CHEEK checked shortly after the start, then was reserved early while saving ground, advanced on the inside on the turn and then rallied well on
the inside to gain the place award late. THE SICARII was allowed to settle early while two wide, eased out leaving the five sixteenths and came five wide
into the drive and rallied mildly to just miss the place award. ZERTZ tracked the early pace three wide and came four wide into the drive but had no kick.
PRIME TIME PLAYER was allowed to settle early while three wide, then raced three to four wide on the turn, angled in by the quarter pole and had no rally.
EASY DAY tracked the early pace on the inside and came three wide into the drive and came up empty.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE JESTER was allowed to settle early while moving down to the inside, made a three wide bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and quickly assumed
command, drew out in the stretch under two left handed pops from the riding crop leaving the furlong marker, then was geared down late to prove much the
best. TUCKERTON BAY prompted the pace three wide, made a bid in between rivals on the far turn, kept on gamely to be clearly second best while no
match to the winner. CRYPT was rated along three wide, made a four wide move on the far turn to loom boldly but flattened out, bested rest. ALL TACKED
UP was well placed on the inside, tipped out three wide leaving the turn but came up empty. SIMMONS was reserved early on the inside and lacked a rally.
LONG TOM was reserved early while three to four wide and had no rally. COOL COMEDIAN set a pressured pace on the inside while controlling the pace
and gave way.

Footnotes
KATHERN'S JOY vied for the early lead on the inside, shook clear leaving the quarter pole, then dug in gamely in the furlong grounds to hold off ASK NEAL
to prove best under a drive. ASK NEAL was rated along four wide, came five wide into the lane and closed well but could not get by the winner, good effort.
ILOVECHARLYBROWN was allowed to settle on the inside, eased off the inside on the turn and came six wide into the lane and was along for the show
award. AFLEET TRAXX stalked the early pace four to three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn but weakened in the drive. VISHNU vied for the lead
three wide and weakened in the drive. OSCAR WINNER was well placed on the inside and weakened.
