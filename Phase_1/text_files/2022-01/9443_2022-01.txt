Footnotes
HUSHED COURT ROOM stalked the leader from the outside while just off of her flank, bid with five sixteenths to go, dueled with that foe turning for home
and into the final furlong as an outer SUPER ET menaced, led into the final sixteenth between those rivals, and just held. SUPER ET tracked two wide
around the first turn, tucked to the rail behind the leading pair at the five furlong pole, stalked from just off around the far turn, tipped outside of them entering
the lane, ranged up inside the final furlong while hanging on her left lead, bid in the final sixteenth, but hung and would not go by. CRAFTY PRINCESS took
a bump from an inner foe at the start, trailed the field around the first turn, split foes three wide at the three furlong pole while commencing a charge, then
stayed on mildly while hanging on her left lead through the lane to claim show approaching the wire. SCRAPPY bobbled slightly at the start without
consequence, set the pace along the inside, met the winner's bid at the three furlong pole, battled inside of that foe entering the lane and through upper
stretch, but yielded a sixteenth out. RECKLESS SERGEANT stalked three wide, but faded into the far turn. SAYANOTHERPRAYER tracked along the
inside while tugging in the bit around the first turn, got keen entering the backstretch, then faded at the five furlong pole, and was done early. ABSOLUTELY
MINDY bumped an outer foe at the start, raced off of the pace along the inside while keen around the first turn, steadied when the rider regripped the reins
to take a firmer hold into the backstretch, and never got involved thereafter. SWEET JACKIELEIGH laid off of the pace three to four wide, and was no factor.

Footnotes
SILENT TAP stalked in the four to three path around the first turn while outside of rivals, pressed the pace setter two wide around the far turn, bid at the
quarter pole, drove clear shortly after, and held from an inner oncharging foe late. CAUSE TO CRUISE broke inwardly, but was last away due to
exaggerated right rein corrected from the rider, trailed the field around the first turn, rated at the rear two wide around the far turn before shifting four wide
entering the lane, split foes at the quarter pole, rallied while drifting inwardly from right handed urging through the final furlong, attempted a late bid inside of
the clear late, but failed to reach. LOLA FLO set a clear pace in the three to two path around the first turn, but got headed by a bidding SILENT TAP passing
the quarter pole, then lost place a sixteenth out. RITHMICALLEA tracked the pace two wide and between horses, shifted to the three path entering the lane,
but lacked a kick to threaten. COSTELLO'S KITTEN stalked along the inside, then chased the leaders from the two path through the lane without bidding.
VISION BOARD saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. WATSONS BAY settled off of the pace three wide, but faded when floated five wide entering
the lane.

Footnotes
DESOTO'S WAR set the pace inside of a vying MISTS OF TIME early on, glided away from that rival under his own power at the three furlong pole, then
widened under mild urging through the lane. FORMAL ORDER tracked the pace around the turn, shifted from the two to three path passing the quarter pole,
then rallied through the lane to claim place at the furlong grounds while not threatening the leader. MISTS OF TIME vied two wide, but failed to keep pace
with his inner counterpart into the turn, chased that foe around the bend, then faded through the lane, but saved show via a head-bob. FAMILIAR WAYS
stalked along the inside, then chased without progressing through the lane, but just missed reaching an outer tiring foe for show. PLEMMONSTON took the
turn in the two to three paths while off of the pace, and failed to factor. FLASHY RICHIE took a light brush from an inner foe at the start, trailed, shifted four
wide entering the lane, and was outrun.

Footnotes
IBERVILLE stalked along the inside, easily slipped inside of the pace setter around the far turn to bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, then assumed
command in upper stretch, and was ridden out under mild urging to the wire. UNINVITED GUEST broke outwardly at the start, settled off of the pace three
wide around the turns, shifted five wide entering the lane, rallied to reach place at the sixteenth pole, and held that position from an outer rival late. RULE
THE EMPIRE trailed around both turns, swung six wide entering the lane, and rallied willingly to gain show late. GUT FEELING tracked from midpack two
wide and between horses, tipped three wide entering the lane, then to the four path in upper stretch to bid for place at the three sixteenths pole, but was
outkicked by outer foes for that position entering the final sixteenth. SILVER NUGGETS settled off of the pace in the two path, tipped to the four path while
searching for racing room entering the lane, but found a wall of traffic at the quarter pole, shifted inwardly soon after to be two wide and between horses at
the three-sixteenths, bid for place inside of rivals at the furlong grounds, but flattened out along the rail. WILLIAM'S CAUSE tracked along the inside, but
lacked a kick along the rail in upper stretch, and faded passing the three sixteenths pole. MASQUERADE BALL set a clear pace in the two path, drifted
outwardly in the latter half of the backstretch before tucking back down to the two path into the far turn, but was headed by an inner foe at the five sixteenths
pole, then weakened approaching the furlong grounds. FIGHTVILLE stalked the pace from the three path, ranged up under a drive around the far turn, but
faded while being floated four wide entering the lane.

Footnotes
MEDLEY set a stoutly pressured pace inside of a vying LOVE RAN RED, met a pair of bids at the five sixteenths pole as her counterpart gave way at the
five sixteenths pole, got headed by those rivals approaching the lane, but gamely reclaimed an advantage passing the quarter pole, repelled her outer rivals
in upper stretch, and drew clear. MISHPACHAH hopped at the start without consequence, stalked the dueling leaders from multiple lengths off, rallied
outside of them into the far turn as DREAMING OF NEANY ranged up alongside, bid with that foe at the five sixteenths pole, briefly showed the way
approaching the lane, but was repelled by the early pace setter passing the quarter pole, then held place from her outer counterpart thereafter. DREAMING
OF NEANY tracked the quick pace, rallied four wide into the far turn to bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole along with an inner MISHPACHAH, but
was repelled and failed to keep pace with the early pace-setter in upper stretch, kept on, but failed to reach show. AVERI EVER AFTER raced off of the
pace along the inside, and failed to factor. LOVE RAN RED sparred for the lead outside of MEDLEY through a fast pace, but weakened at the five
sixteenths pole as outer foes made bids. MY FRIEND MR. JIM lagged well behind, lost contact with the field into the far turn, was distanced through the
lane, walked across the wire, and walked off.

COURAGEOUSLY stalked while forwardly placed three wide, shifted to the four path entering the lane to bid in upper stretch, got floated to the five path at
the furlong grounds while forging an advantage, and drew off through the final sixteenth. FED MONEY rated off of the pace two wide, swung six wide
entering the lane, then rallied willingly through the final furlong to reach place on the wire. ULTIMATE IRONY saved ground off of the pace, split foes two
wide at the furlong grounds to attempt a bid for place inside of rivals approaching the wire, but got outfinished. READY TO ROLL stalked along the inside,
shifted two wide entering the lane, chased between horses to bid for place at in the final sixteenth, but was outfinished by rivals on either side. HOT STOVE
LEAGUE stalked from the three two to path, shifted back to the three path while bidding entering the lane, vied between horses in upper stretch before
drifting to the four path at the furlong grounds, failed to keep pace with an outer foe passing that marker, and was swallowed up late. NO SLO MO 2hopped
at the start and trailed the field around both turns, shifted off of the rail entering the lane, then altered course to the five path in midstretch, and moved up.
LONG AND STRONG broke a step slowly, shifted inwardly, and shied from an inner foe at the start, raced far off of the pace, took the far turn three wide
before swinging seven wide entering the lane, and improved late. FUTURE PERFECT tracked the pace from the two path, shifted to the four path in upper
stretch, but lacked a kick before fading. FILIPPO set a clear pace early on, but met bids passing the quarter pole, and weakened at the furlong grounds.
WINE TO ROSES tracked from the three path while in the bit around the first turn, took the far turn three to five wide, and weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
STARBURST broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, set the pace along the inside as that rival pursued, inched a bit further clear of that foe at the
quarter pole, and held sway firmly thereafter. SANTA CRUISER tracked from off of the pace two wide, tipped three wide at the quarter pole, and rallied to
reach place on the wire. SUPREMACY took a bump from an inner foe at the start, stalked that rival from the outside, but only managed to chase that foe
through the lane, and got nailed on the wire for place. SUPER COMET trailed, gained along the rail into the turn to claim show, but flattened through the late
stages. SNOW HOUSE never got involved.

Footnotes
GENTLE SOUL bumped an outer rival while put to tight quarters at the start, rated at the rear along the inside, gained four to five wide around the far turn
before fanning to the seven path in upper stretch, rallied well to bid approaching the furlong pole, led leaving that junction, and drew clear. ATTORNEY TIM
settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path turning for home, rallied between horses while shifting ground inwardly through upper
stretch, but decidedly aimed for a two wide split at the furlong grounds rather than slipping through a rail opening, and surged between rivals at the sixteenth
pole to reach place. FENWICK STATION bumped with an inner foe while between horses at the start, trailed two wide around the first turn, shifted out and
improved position in the early part of the backstretch, tracked from midpack three to four wide around the far turn, shifted to the six path in upper stretch
while sustaining a grind, but was outkicked by an outer rival approaching the final furlong, and kept on, but was outfinished by an inner foe for place. IOYA
AGAIN raced far off of the pace in the two path, took the far turn in the three to four path, got outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, then tipped six
wide in midstretch, and improved. PINE KNOLL bobbled slightly before bumping an outer foe at the start, pressed the pace three wide, bid two wide into the
far turn, vied between horses turning for home, but was outkicked by wider bidding foes at the furlong grounds, and gave way. BIG AGENDA tracked from
the three path, ranged up while pressing the pace three wide around the far turn, bid at the quarter pole, vied in the four path through upper stretch, but
faltered at the furlong grounds. SILVER N LAI pressed two wide and between horses around the first turn, backed off to stalk entering the backstretch,
tracked from the pocket around the far turn, but lacked a kick to split the leaders in upper stretch, chased them into midstretch, and faded. FOREVER MO
hopped slightly at the star, raced off of the pace in the three to two paths around the turns, then lacked a rally while hanging on his left lead. THE LAST ZIP
cleared into the first turn, set the pace, vied inside of a pair of foes around the far turn, then weakened at the furlong grounds. HALEYS SAILOR tracked
along the inside from the two path, but faded.

Footnotes
BIRD EMPRESS broke inwardly at the start, pressed the pace the pace setter from the outside, dueled with that foe around the far turn, and drew clear
through the final furlong. CHARDONNAY broke outwardly, but cleared off into the first turn, showed the way before dueling with an outer BIRD EMPRESS
around the far turn, but proved no match for that foe at the furlong grounds. PRIMA BALLERINA tracked the pace four to three wide around the first turn,
stalked the top two around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with them in upper stretch, and chased them home to claim show at the sixteenth pole. GUN
SLINGIN broke a step slowly, tracked the pace two wide and between horses around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the top two while chasing
inside of PRIMA BALLERINA through upper stretch, then tired and lost show approaching the final sixteenth. ICE MAIDEN tracked three wide and between
horses into the first turn, but failed to keep pace with those rivals leaving the seven furlong pole, faltered to trail the field at the five furlong pole, then
regained stride turning for home, and passed tired foes. MY AIM IS TRUE was minorly forced inwardly by an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside
around the first turn, but lost position before coming under a drive passing the half mile pole, shifted off of the rail into the far turn, then got floated five wide
entering the lane, and tired. BOMBARRA GOLD trailed, gained inside of a foe into the far turn, swung four wide entering the lane, but lugged inwardly in
upper stretch while weakening.
