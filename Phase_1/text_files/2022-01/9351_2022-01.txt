Footnotes
GHOSTING KIM unhurried to turn, circled six wide into the stretch, furious run in an impressive effort. MS TEMPTATION unhurried early, ran on five wide in
the stretch while no match for the winner, best of the rest. GIRL NAMED PATSY never far back to stretch, outkicked by the top pair to the wire. KANSAS
KIS tardy start, rushed inside with no room turn, evenly late going. MUSED (GB) three wide speed, stayed game to stretch, gave way. FOUETTE tracked
pace to turn outside, brief lead stretch, outkicked late. TWIRLING RUTH speed to the front inside, stopped badly from the turn.

place, no match. SUPER LUCY had a sluggish start, erratic stretch run for the show spot. DE BOLT LIGHT good position to turn, angled out and moved up
in the stretch. FINE PROSPECTURE tracked top pair to the stretch, evened out in the drive. GOLDEN ACCOUNT never a real menace. TRAVEL GIRL

a threat.
