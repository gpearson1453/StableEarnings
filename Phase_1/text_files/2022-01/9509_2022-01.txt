Footnotes
BORN TO BE KING slow early saved ground to upper stretch swinging off the rail mid stretch rallying up in time. POWERFUL MOON pressured the pace
dueling on the rail to upper stretch battling late ceding grudgingly in the last yards. TRAMORE BAY pressed on the turn dueling abreast rival down the lane
ceding late between horses. CAPTURED BY FATE chased the pace racing evenly down the lane holding position late. COTTON JIM pressed the pace
dueling through the turn wearing out in upper stretch. SHINING THROUGH slow early played no factor. SILVER DOLLAR CITY raced second flight tiring in
upper stretch. CANTANKEROUS BOBBY gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
APACHE stalked the pace advancing on the turn looming three deep in upper stretch locking up abreast foe in deep stretch prevailing gamely. ANOTHER
BREEZE pressed early saving ground to upper stretch taking a short lead on the rail dueling to the wire missing in a game effort. GIO SAMMY pressured
the pace edging clear on the turn, hooked from the inside in upper stretch would weaken late. HE'S A WARRIOR slow early lagged to upper stretch moving
past tired ones there. FOSTER HOPE hustled along raced wide to upper stretch weakening there. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR played no factor. DON'T
MATTER chased early then faded to upper stretch. SAINT SCOTTY in close at the break stayed back.
