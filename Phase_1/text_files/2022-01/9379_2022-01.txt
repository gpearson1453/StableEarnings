Footnotes
SHO NUFF broke through gates, vied for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, drove clear and was kept to the task. IN FOR A PENNY raced near
the back in the beginning, came around the turn on the outside, entered the stretch wide, rallied down the lane, proved no match for the winner, but got up
for second. HALO'S SONG void of early speed, made a late rail bid and was outfinished for second. ROUX BANDIT dueled on the front end, forwardly
placed throughout and hung deep in the stretch. SADIE'S RANSOM pressed the early pace, raced three wide around the turn and faded.

Footnotes
FIRST I'VE SEEN vied for the early advantage, came around the turn on the outside, racing three wide, came in down the lane, drove clear and proved the
best. LAKE MARIE dueled on the front end, saved ground around the turn, steadied late and proved no match for the winnner. COURTLY DOC was an
early factor, forwardly placed throughout, was outfinished by the top two and proved best of others. LUTIE MO raced near the middle of the field, came
around the turn on the outside, made a mild bid, but was no factor. READY READY raced near the middle of the pack and lacked a late kick. SCARLET
STORM void of early speed, raced outside around the turn, improved position, but was no threat. CHARLIE'S PEAK raced within striking distance and
faded. GOTTEMINABIND raced within contention, saved ground around the turn and dropped back. KATIE'S C always raced near the back and showed
little. HURRICANE SIREN lacked early speed and was never close. THE JOCKEY OF #8 LAKE MARIE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #9 FIRST
I'VE SEEN FOR INTERFERENCE DOWN THE HOME STRETCH. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

LUNAR LIGHT raced within contention, saved ground around the turn, dueled on the rail and prevailed for the win. TOP BRASS vied for the early lead,
forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the lane and was outfinished for the win. BAPTISM challenged on the front end, raced close throughout, couldn't
keep up with the top two late, but was best of others. SANDYS BLAZE pressed the early pace, raced outside around the turn and faltered down the stretch.
ONEHOLYLION void of early speed, saved ground around the turn and was never a threat. SPREAD THE FAITH lacked early speed, came around the turn
wide and was outrun.

Footnotes
CILLA raced within contention, moved up around the turn, dueled with ICY CHARLIE and proved the best late, driving clear before the wire. ICY CHARLIE
challenged for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but held on well for second. ONEROLLOFTHEDICE lacked early
speed, raced outside around the turn, made a late bid and finished willingly. KELA'S TURN raced in the middle of the field and finished evenly. MISTY DAY
lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. IMA DISCREET LADY stumbled at the start, racing near the back, lacked a rally and put forth an
even effort. BROKE FINANCING raced near the middle of the field, weakened and was no threat late. SHELLBY flashed early speed, saved ground and
faded. MISS PAT'S GIRL void of early speed, finished wide and was never close.
