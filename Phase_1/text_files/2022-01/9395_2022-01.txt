Footnotes
PAISLEY CROSS vied for the early advantage, took command around the turn, pulled away and proved the best. GOODNIGHT GRACIE had a tight start,
racing in the rear, moved up between rivals around the turn, made a late bid and got up for second. D'WILD BARONESS raced near the back in the
beginning, moved up on the outside around the turn and was outfinished for second. SOPHIE'S PRAYER broke out, raced near the back, made a mild bid,
but was no factor. STARBUCK LUCK dueled on the front end, saved ground around the turn and faded. BUILDING HOME pressed the early pace and was
finished early. SHADES OF TRUTH was an early factor, raced outside around the turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
PIPES AND DRUMS raced within striking distance, moved up on the outside around the second turn, dueled down the lane with G VICTORY and drove
clear before the wire. G VICTORY went to the front, drove clear, saved ground around the final turn, dueled down the lane, was outfinished for the win, but
proved best of others. RUMOHR REIGNS vied for the early advantage, eased back, made a mild bid, proved no match for the top two, but got up for third.
MISTER K pressed the pace, raced outside around the final turn and was outfinished for third. SPANKHURST was an early factor, forwardly placed
throughout and faded. HAIL SOUTHERN raced near the middle of the field, came around the first turn on the outside, faded and was no threat late. TAP
ATTACK void of early speed and was never close. WILD ONE FOREVER lacked early speed, raced wide around the first turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
HATTIES JEWEL unhurried in the beginning, moved up, three wide around the second turn, dueled with HE TAKES CHARGE down the stretch and
prevailed for the win. HE TAKES CHARGE vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the lane, was outfinished for the win, but
proved best of others. CHOP CHOP CHARLIE pressed the pace, raced close throughout and proved no match for the top two late. FULL OF RUN lacked
early speed, raced outside around the first turn, came around the second turn four wide, made a bid and finished evenly. EASTSIDE BOY void of early
speed, improved position, but was no factor. HONOR MY SPEED lacked early speed, saved ground around the second turn and was never a factor. CAJUN
CASH raced within striking distance and faded. SOUTHPINE GIFT raced within contention in the beginning, dropped back and was no threat late. TOWN
DRUNK flashed early speed, dropped back, was pulled up late and walked off.

ITS A WRAP bumped at the start, went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and won under urging. TAPAGE unhurried in the beginning, made a late
wide rally, finished willingly and got up for second. WARRIOR'S MAP raced in the middle of the field, made a bid and was caught late for second. JIMI'S A
STAR lacked early speed, moved up, racing outside around the final turn and finished evenly. FREDONIAN pressed the early pace, forwardly placed until
late, faded down the home stretch. MUSCADINE void of early speed, came around the second turn wide and passed tired ones. YOUNG BULL bumped
start, steadied, racing in tight quarters and was never a factor. BOW AND ARROW showed early speed, raced inside around the final turn and dropped
back. LIKEN IT broke out, raced in the middle of the field and retreated. FORT KNOX pressed the early pace and retreated to the rear.

Footnotes
MADISON JOY had a tight start, racing in the rear, rallied on the outside around the second turn and was going away at the end. LIGHT AS A WHISPER
went to the front, drove clear, veered in at the head of home stretch, steadied, proved no match for the winner, but held on for second. STORM BREACH
pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished for second. MY BABY BELE lacked early speed, made a wide gain, but was no factor.
ZEATRICAL broke in, raced within contention and faded. SHOOTING STICK raced near the back in the beginning, had an outside trip, moved up, but was
no threat. OLD TIME GIRL lacked early speed and never mounted a bid. MY LITTLE GUERA pressed the early pace and retreated. DOUBLE APPEAL
raced within striking distance and dropped back. DISTORTED KITTY pressed the early pace, racing outside around the first turn, dropped back and trailed
late.
