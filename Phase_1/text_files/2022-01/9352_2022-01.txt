Footnotes
DIESEL JACK stalked the clear leader from the outside, bid in upper stretch, quickly assumed command, and drew off under driving pressure through the
final furlong. BATTLE OF WILL laid off of the pace three to four wide around the turn, shifted inside of a drifting PRIMEINTERESTRATE entering the lane,
and stayed on to claim place at the sixteenth pole. JACKIE MOON sped clear early on, but offered little resistance to DIESEL JACK's bid in upper stretch,
then lost place passing the sixteenth pole. WAITIN' ON A WOMAN tracked from midpack two wide, but got shuffled behind PRIMEINTERESTRATE into the
turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, and improved for a minor share. R AND R STAR brushed an outer foe and was quickly taken in hand at the start,
trailed the field around the turn, swung six wide in upper stretch, and moved up. PRIMEINTERESTRATE laid forwardly placed along the inside, but failed to
sustain position into the turn, shifted three wide approaching the three furlong pole, but drifted five wide passing the quarter pole, and weakened on his left
lead. MY PAL GREELEY laid off of the pace along the inside, and got outrun.

Footnotes
CURTIN'S UP set a clear pace, inched further away passing the quarter pole, and lasted from a pair of outer pursuers late. CLUB SODA stalked three wide,
took aim on the clear leader in upper stretch, chased him into the final sixteenth as HIGH CRUISE ranged up along side, but drifted outwardly under left
handed pressure through the late stages, and did not have enough. HIGH CRUISE hopped slightly at the start and was off slowly, tracked from midpack four
wide, grinded away through upper stretch to bid for place outside of CLUB SODA in the late stages, but was subtly herded outwardly by that foe, and was
denied place. HUG THE MUNNY stalked along the inside of a pair of rivals, but failed to keep pace with them passing the three furlong pole, checked at the
five sixteenths, then shifted to the three path in upper stretch, and stayed on for a minor share. THE GRAY BLUR took the turn in the two path while off of
the pace, came into the lane in the four path, and moved up in the closing stages. JUST BLAZE trailed in the three path around the turn, tipped to the six
path entering the lane, but failed to factor. W W KAN DO stalked two wide and between horses around the turn, but tired in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ABUELO NUNO stalked along the inside, bid for the lead inside of the pace setter at the furlong grounds after that foe vacated the rail, forged an advantage
a sixteenth out, and edged away. CITIZEN WEST broke outwardly, but sped clear soon after, shifted off of the rail at the three sixteenths pole as a pair of
foes closed in, but allowed racing room for ABUELO NUNO in the process, then got headed by that foe at the sixteenth pole. GEMO RAIN stalked two wide,
chased the leader through upper stretch, but lacked a kick before tiring in the late stages, and saved show. EKATI'S VERVE chased three wide under
strong urging early on, remained under a drive in the three to two path around the bend, then kept on to gain a minor share late. LOOKIN HIGH broke slowly
while brushing the outer part of the gate, laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted five wide in upper stretch, but failed to factor. MURDO tracked from the
four path around the turn, but tired in midstretch. KYLE'S BRO JIMMY got outrun.

Footnotes
ARTISTIC JEWLER tracked along the inside, gained to stalk from the pocket into the far turn, tipped three wide and between horses entering the lane, bid in
upper stretch, drove clear at the furlong grounds, then tired late, but lasted. BEAUTIFUL BELLA trailed along the inside around the first turn, gained four
wide around the far turn before tipping five wide entering the lane, failed to keep pace with an inner bidding foe in midstretch, but kept on while hanging on
her left lead thereafter, grinded away as the leader tired in the closing stages, but did not have enough to reel her in. SWANAGE pressed the pace two wide,
brushed with an outer PERFECT DIVA at the eleven-sixteenths, vied around the far turn, forged an advantage at the five-sixteenths, but was outkicked by a
pair of foes at the furlong grounds, and held show. PERFECT DIVA stalked three wide, brushed with an inner foe in the early part of the backstretch,
pressed under urging around the far turn, but got floated four wide and between horses by an inner shifting ARTISTIC JEWLER, but got outkicked by that
rival and shied mildly when she came across her path at the three sixteenths pole, then kept on. RUNAWAY HENNY sat reserved far off of the pace in the
two path around the first turn, swung five wide entering the lane, but lacked a rally. SUSAN STRONG broke a bit slowly at the start, took the first turn in the
three path while at the rear, and never got involved. QUEEN'S MISSION set the pace along the inside, vied inside of SWANAGE around the far turn, but
weakened inside of a quartet of rivals passing the quarter pole.

advantage approaching the final sixteenth, and edged away. CYPRIANO vied two wide, led in the three path at the quarter pole, but was bested by an inner
foe in the final furlong. GYPSY'S SOULMATE was brushed by an inner foe into an outer rival at the start, raced just off of the pace two wide and between
horses into the turn, but only managed to chase the leaders in upper stretch, shifted four wide at the furlong grounds, and stayed on to reach show on the
wire. PERFECT PERIGEE broke outwardly and brushed a rival, set the pace inside of a vying CYPRIANO, got headed by that foe while tipping to the two
path entering the lane, sustained vying position through midstretch as MONEY AND ME bid to his inside, but yielded in the final sixteenth, and got nailed on
the wire for show. CUSTOM SIERRA stalked three wide and from between horses, but tired on his left lead in uppers tretch. GRAND PRIORITY broke a
step slowly before being brushed by an inner foe at the start, raced off of the pace in the two to three path around the turn, swung six wide in upper stretch,

CARMEL CRUSH took a bump from an inner foe at the start, recovered to clear the field while well in hand early on, received a breather around the far turn,
but responded willingly when let out a notch in upper stretch, drew off under mild urging, and was wrapped up through the late stages. CASH ROCKET
stalked the loose leader from the two path, chased as that foe's closest pursuer around the far turn, but failed to progress through lane, and was second
best. JIMMY DAN bobbled outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, stalked the clear leader from the three path, but lost position around the far turn, then
sustained stride through the lane to pass a tiring foe for a minor reward. SAILOR'S RETURN rated off of the pace along the inside, chased CASH ROCKET
from the three path around the far turn in hopes of producing a place bid, but tired through the lane. INFLUENTIAL was outrun.

SPIRITED BEAUTY broke through the gate pre-race, but was quickly reloaded without further incident, stalked the pace three wide, took aim on a clear
PLATINUM QUEEN around the far turn, quickly ranged up at the five sixteenths, took a bump from that foe at the quarter pole before assuming command,
and drew off under driving pressure thereafter. VISIONOFWILDTIMES got fractious in the gates before SPIRITED BEAUTY broke through them, then
tracked the pace two wide around the first turn, lost ground entering the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, then stayed on to claim place from a
lugging and tiring foe at the furlong grounds. PLATINUM QUEEN broke a step slowly at the start, rushed four wide and outside of foes around the first turn
to bid entering the backstretch, drew clear at the five furlong pole, but began to get out turning for home as SPRITED BEAUTY ranged up along side,
bumped that foe while getting surpassed at the quarter pole, then lugged out sharply through upper stretch while weakening. STEPH'SFULLASUGAR set
the pace around the first turn, but allowed an outer rushing PLATINUM QUEEN to clear off at the five furlong pole, stalked into the far turn, but was
outmoved by an outer foe around that bend, and faded through the lane. HOTMOLLY was shuffling her feet when the gates opened, but was not costed
position, then was outrun throughout, got eased through the lane, and jogged across the wire. EXPLOSIVELY HOT had her head down when the gates
opened, then simply refused to break after lifting it soon after, jogged to the first turn, then walked off.

Footnotes
AUNT JOIE raced forwardly placed two wide early on, tipped outside of the leading trio into the turn, ranged up to bid four wide at the quarter pole, and
drove clear at the furlong grounds. FROSTERIA stalked three wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, came into the lane between horses as AUNT
JOIE ranged up alongside, but failed to keep pace with that foe at the furlong grounds, and was second best. PARKER EVA chased two wide, vied between
horses at the five sixteenths pole, but gave way to outer rivals approaching the furlong grounds, and chased them home to secure show. AWESOME
TREAT lunged inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, saved ground off of the pace, then rallied two wide and between horses through the lane to claim a
minor share. MA CHERIE tracked from midpack two wide, took the turn in the three path, hung on his left lead through the lane while maintaining a minor
share, but was nailed by an inner foe late. HELLO HERO broke a step slowly at the start and trailed the field after being slow into stride, swung to the six
path entering the lane, and improved outside of foes. DIAL IT UP A NOTCH settled off of the pace three wide, took the turn in the four path, gained mildly
five wide in upper stretch while hanging on her left lead, but lugged inwardly at the furlong grounds, lost momentum due to rider correction, and faltered.
LADY BRIELLE raced off of the pace in the three path and between horses around the turn, was put to a bit of tight quarters at the three sixteenths pole,
altered out shortly after, but lacked a rally. CANDY ANNE bobbled slightly at the start, but quickly recovered and sped clear early on, met a pair of bids at
the five sixteenths pole, then weakened inside of a trio of rivals at the quarter pole. MIZ TROUBADOUR took a bump from an outer foe at the start, saved
ground in midpack around the turn, but faded through the lane.

Footnotes
CIROC O CLOCK tracked from midpack along the inside, tipped two to three wide entering the lane, bid between horses at the three sixteenths pole, led in
midstretch, and held well from an outer foe late. MISTA VALENTINE trailed in the five to four path around the first turn, tucked and took the far turn in the
two path, rallied turning for home while shifting outside of the leading quartet entering the lane, bid approaching the furlong grounds while hanging on his left
lead, but was kept at bay. JOEBOY raced in midpack two wide, tracked three to four wide around the far turn, bid between horses at the three sixteenths
pole, but hung on his left lead, and flattened out in the final furlong. BOURBON SKY stalked in the four path around the first turn, pressed the leader while in
the three path around the far turn, bid entering the lane, but was outkicked by outer rivals at the three sixteenths pole, and faded. UNBRIDLED HOPE set a
clear pace in the two path, but got headed entering the lane, and yielded at the three sixteenths pole. ARGYBARGY BUCK was reluctant to load, raced
forwardly placed along the inside, but bore outwardly around the far turn, bolted entering the backstretch, then failed to factor. CONQUISTADOR GOLD
stalked in the three path around the first turn, saved ground around the far turn, but weakened through the lane. THISGUYCANFLY raced far off of the pace
in the six to five path around the first turn, and got outrun.
