Footnotes
BRAVO KITTEN secured inside position around the first turn, rated near mipack up the backstretch, waited patiently along the rail then launched a bid
leaving the far turn, roused forward to a slim lead past the furlong marker, dug in under steady encouragement and held clear. BRISKY FROLIC was a bit
tight around the first turn, stalked inside up the backstretch, waited in traffic around the far turn, shifted out four wide for a clear path near the furlong marker
and finished with good response. AMERICAN HEROINE settled near midpack, picked up the pace late on the far turn, was set down five wide for the drive,
closed with response and gained ground in deep stretch. BITTY BOSS set a pressured pace up the backstretch, dueled with EMPRESS ELLIE through the
final turn, battled back past the furlong marker and came up empty in late stages. EMPRESS ELLIE prompted the pace up the backstretch, dueled for the
lead with BITTY BOSS around the far turn, battled on past the furlong marker then gave way. HEDY LAMARR tracked the pace through early stages,
loomed three wide at the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane and steadily weakened. RED ROSES TOO was unhurried and saved ground, shifted out
late on the far turn, raced wide into the lane and failed to move on. SIEMPRE ELEGANTE hit the gate and came away slowly at the start, continued
reserved in the back, swung wide into the stretch run and had no response. MAGNOLIA ROAD raced off the early pace, was ridden along four wide through
the far turn and faded in the lane. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE

Footnotes
FORTY SMOOTH set a rated pace in the two path, edged further clear around the far turn and held firm under a drive. UPTOWN QUEEN settled off the
early pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, had aim outside of the winner in midstretch, switched back to the left lead near
the sixteenth pole and could only gain slightly late. SYLVANELLA stalked the winner in the clear in the three path around the first turn, chased under urging
rounding the far turn and was one-paced through the lane. KEITANY was in range while racing two wide between foes around the first turn, went three wide
around the far turn and finished evenly. TRULY saved ground in range and lacked a rally. BLUES SONGS bobbled at the break and trailed inside.

KATIE'S COWBOY pursued the leaders three wide around the turn, rallied to reach the front outside rivals in deep stretch and edged clear. MIDNIGHT
PUNK bumped with GUMWRAPPER at the start, vied between UNPUBLISHED and TENACITY ZIP early, dug in through a long drive and yielded
grudgingly. TENACITY ZIP battled outside UNPUBLISHED and MIDNIGHT PUNK up front, held a short lead turning for home, then weakened through the
closing stages. BACKWOODS BOOGIE saved ground outsprinted early, and improved position through the stretch in the two-path. REAGAN'S HEART
raced four wide around the turn within range, and flattened out through the drive. GUMWRAPPER bumped with MIDNIGHT PUNK at the start, and lacked a
closing bid inside. IDLE TIME moved inside around the turn, and could not reach contention. UNPUBLISHED argued the early pace inside rivals, and
weakened after three-eighths of a mile.

Footnotes
BATTLE CRY tracked the pace along the outside up the backstretch, coaxed three wide around the turn, came out wider for the drive, remained determined
in pursuit of OUR FANTASY and ran down rival in late stages. OUR FANTASY applied pace pressure to SIMPLIFY up the backstretch, cleared command
with three furlongs left to run, came three to four wide into the lane, remained clear past the furlong marker then got reeled in by the winner in final stages.
PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL tracked the top two leaders saving ground through early stages, angled out late on the turn, sustained a steady outside bid through
the stretch run and cleared the rest. VICTORY CRUSADE raced off the early pace, saved ground through the turn, came two wide into the lane and lacked
a needed rally. SIMPLIFY (ARG) set a pressured pace up the backstretch, got collared for the lead entering the turn and faded past upper stretch. MIDSHIP
LADY raced three to four wide and failed to move into contention.

ON ALERT settled off the pace along the inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole, closed between foes and was up in deep stretch. BLYTHE SPIRIT
pressed the pace two wide between foes, took a short lead in upper stretch, dueled inside of PIMENOVA to deep stretch, was no match for the winner late
but stayed on gamely to hold second. ESTATE saved ground in range, swung four wide turning for home, continued on the left lead through the stretch, bid
near the sixteenth pole and flattened out late. PIMENOVA prompted the pace three wide, reached even terms near the quarter pole, dueled to deep stretch
and was outfinished. CUMULONIMBUS broke in a tangle, raced well back two and three wide and rallied belatedly. MARYSVALE saved ground well back,
was boxed in around the far turn, swung six wide in upper stretch and never threatened. HONEYCOMB bobbled at the start, was in range two and three
wide, faded in the drive and was vanned off. ROYAL BLUSH was devoid of speed, raced two wide around the turns and showed some late interest.
INFLUENCING played no factor while racing three wide. BRAVO ZULU set the pace along the rail and tired in the drive. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE.

SPECTACULAR GAL broke sharply, prompted the pace outside SUM RETURN for six furlongs, rallied determinedly through the stretch, wore down the
leader with 70 yards remaining and prevailed to the wire all out. SUM RETURN took control soon after the start, rated along a bit off the inside to the stretch,
remained clear to midstretch, responded when headed and just missed inside the winner. FISH MOONEY went along in the two-path to the far turn, shifted
out four wide at the top of the stretch, went back inward leaving the furlong grounds and rallied with good energy inside the top two. RUNAWAY BREEZE
saved ground in easy striking range for six furlongs, moved out three wide coming off the far turn and lacked a closing bid. CASCADE PARK steadied
between VIOLENT ZAP and FISH MOONEY shortly after the start, fanned five wide approaching the stretch and made no headway. VIOLENT ZAP failed to
menace through an inside trip.

Footnotes
ASTROTURF raced two to three wide into the first turn, settled off the pace up the backstretch, tipped out and moved up three wide late on the far turn,
cleared command in the upper stretch and stayed sharp under steady pressure. GONNA BE EPIC was unhurried around the first turn, continued near the
rear up the backstretch, moved up closer four wide late on the far turn, sustained a steady outside bid through the lane and finished clearly second best.
SWEENEY'S CAT fanned four wide around the first turn, tracked the pace up the backstretch, loomed a threat two wide at the quarter pole, could not
advance with the top pair out of the far turn but stayed on with interest and cleared the rest. SKYWALKING was reserved racing in the back, coaxed four
wide into the lane and improved position without threatening. MR EVERYTHING was not too far back while rated two to three wide up the backstretch,
coaxed three wide through the far turn and failed to move on. CHROME FINISH was forwardly placed into the backstretch, stalked the pacesetter to the far
turn, took over the lead near the five sixteenths pole, got collared turning for home and weakened. VINNY DREAM was a bit headstrong and steadied inside
around the first turn, settled off the early pace, came five wide into the lane and had no late response. K. K. ICHIKAWA raced two wide around the first turn,
rated off the early pace, was ridden along two wide into the lane and failed to move on. DRUM AND DRUMMER set the pace up the backstretch, got
collared midway through the far turn and retreated. POLITICAL RIOT stalked the pace inside, urged two though the final turn and faded turning for home.
WILLIAM BOY rated inside midpack up the backstretch and retreated entering the far turn.

Footnotes
UPHOLD THE LAW pressed the pace two wide, took over nearing the three-eighths pole, drew clear approaching the lane, stayed on the left lead through
the stretch and widened under a drive. TOWN CLASSIC settled off the pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn and finished willingly while unable
to seriously threaten the winner. BAGBOSS veered in at the start, rushed up inside to reach a stalking position, angled three wide entering the turn,
remained up close to upper stretch, could not keep pace with the top two in the lane and was vanned off after the finish. BAYOU BENNY set the pace along
the rail for a half and tired. BAILEY failed to menace while racing two wide. THREEFIFTYSEVEN was outrun inside. KANTSTAROS was pulled up on the
turn and vanned off.

Footnotes
GRAND AVE GIRL shadowed SERENADE A KITTEN early, took over from outside midway on the far turn, moved to the rail for the drive and remained
clear under pressure. EDITOR AT LARGE (IRE) raced alone in third for six furlongs, had aim outside GRAND AVE GIRL once straightened away for the
drive, could not reach that one and just saved the place. TONED UP advanced approaching the stretch while shifting out four wide, rallied with good
courage outside and was getting to the runner-up at the finish. SHORT CIRCUIT was in or near the two-path much of the way, and failed to menace.
DREAM OF CHANGE (IRE) lost her footing at the break and spotted the field several lengths, got a bit closer coming to the head of the stretch while moving
off the inside, but quickly flattened out. SERENADE A KITTEN dashed clear with an alert beginning, could not hold off GRAND AVE GIRL on the far turn,
and folded up.

Footnotes
ROYAL SPIRIT stalked inside up the backstretch, shifted out four wide late on the far turn, came wider into the lane, roused forward to challenge MEN ON
THE HILL past the furlong marker, dug in under steady pressure and edged away. MEN ON THE HILL (IRE) tracked the pace through early stages, vied
three deep through the final turn, held a slim lead at the furlong marker, fought back when challenged by ROYAL SPIRIT but could not match strides in deep
stretch. NO NAY FRANKLIN (IRE) was forwardly placed up the backstretch, vied for the lead and got bumped between rivals leaving the far turn, stayed on
with response past the furlong marker then flattened out. TWIRLING BLUES rated near midpack up the backstretch, coaxed three wide through the far turn,
came five wide into the lane and had a mild improve. PARQUETRY raced in range outside through early stages, was ridden along four wide into the lane
and failed to kick on. FIELD MARSHAL fanned five wide around the first turn, rated off the early pace, urged outside into stretch run and lacked a needed
rally. JIMMY THE BOOT raced near midpack, saved ground around the final turn, tipped out wider for the drive and never threatened. CHELSEA DAGGER
was off a step slow at the start, raced off the pace, saved ground through the far turn, tipped wider for the drive and never menaced. COLERIDGE raced off
the pace, saved ground through the far turn and had no response. GRAND CAY was unhurried, saved ground around the final turn and had no response.
ARGYLL set the pace up the backstretch, vied through the far turn then retreated past upper stretch. CONNECTED came three wide into the lane and had
no response. THE RIDER OF NO WAY FRANKLIN CLIAMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF MEN ON THE HILL FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT
THE TOP OF THE STRETCH, AFTER REVIEW NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. RUNUP UNAVAILABLE.
