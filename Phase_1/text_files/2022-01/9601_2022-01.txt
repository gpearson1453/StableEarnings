Footnotes
SHINY PENNY gave chase leaving the half mile pole and took the lead two deep past the quarter, dueled clear midway on the turn and was steadily
handled to widen the final sixteenth. AWESOME INCENTIVE gave chase, ran in the four path of the turn, dug in from the head of the lane and took second
later yards. MYGIDGETMARIE took over at the half mile pole and set the pace inside, gave up the lead past the quarter pole, dropped back mid turn then
flattened past the eighth pole. AWESOME LAWSON gave chase inside, rounded the turn off the rail, drifted into the stretch and flattened stride. TELL
ALEXIS gave early chase toward mid track, raced off the rail on the turn and showed little further. SAFE REEZAN stumbled badly and nearly lost her rider
on the chute and lost all chance. SAMURAISLUCKYSWORD never factored and was eased. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
DISTORTED SPLENDOR rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn and dug
in determinedly to eke out the nod over KINKY FROLIC, who stalked two deep, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole and contested at a close
disadvantage two deep on the turn, dug in gamely through the stretch but missed in a head bobbing finish. SECRET PRIZE broke outward to make contact
with Rhythm Tree and settled inside the first turn, moved to the outside into the backstretch and bid leaving the three eighths pole, ran in the five path of the
far turn and came along for third later yards. C V'S CAMPFIRE settled off the pace toward the inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on
the far turn then flattened the final furlong. AREEMAA raced off the pace about the three path, picked up the chase from the five sixteenths pole, ran in the
three and four paths of the far turn and showed little further. SPECIAL FREEDOM was bumped at the break and raced off the pace in the three path the first
turn, gave chase nearing the five sixteenths pole then weakened into the far turn. RHYTHM TREE was bumped outward and into Special Freedom leaving
the gate then saved ground and was through early.

WITNESS THE ENERGY pressured the pace and took the lead two deep approaching the top of the lane, dueled clear mid-stretch and was kept alert to
hold on well. HOOK THE CHAIN chased the pace toward the inside, raced off the rail on the turn and dug in from the head of the lane to take the nod for
second under the wire. PETTYFORURTHOUGHTS was crowded at the break then chased inside, ran at the rail on the turn, appeared a threat a furlong
away but was nipped from second under the wire. HAZY WINTER was crowded at the break and gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in
the three path and finished well to improve her position. LOVETHEONEYOUGOT gave chase, rounded the turn in the six path and finished evenly outside.
MICHEAUX was hustled to the front nearing the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, rounded the turn at the rail, was caught while losing
ground toward the head of the lane then weakened mid-stretch. IHEARTRAINACOMN gave chase and rounded the turn near the rail. EXCUSES EXCUSES
came in at the break and gave close chase through the backstretch, though, faded in the four and five paths of the turn.

Footnotes
BUZZHOUND took the lead between horses leaving the thirteen sixteenths pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure at the three
eighths, widened at the rail on the far turn and held well under steady handling. TOMMY PIES saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran in the
three path of the far turn, swung outward to the five path into the stretch and got up for second inside the sixteenth pole. ROOF TOP BAR rounded the
opening turn in the four path, gave chase past the half mile pole, was forced out to the six path nearing the head of the lane and ran evenly in the lane. THE
DON OF SQUAN rounded the first turn in the two and three paths, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the seven path,
improved his position through the lane but flattened late. DUNLUCE CAISSLE steadied early and ran in the three and four paths of the opening turn, bid
toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. DAY OF HONOR raced outside into the backstretch, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the eight path and ran widest in the lane. INJECT THE LIGHT stalked the early pace two
deep, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then weakened inside the eighth pole. EARTHQUAKEDIRECTOR
raced well back mostly saving ground. LUNAR IMAGE rated close inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then
weakened. RUN RABBIT stalked three wide, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
YOUTHINKTHATSFUNNY rated just off the pace inside the first turn, started a four wide bid toward the three eighths pole, took the lead three wide midway
on the far turn and dug in under steady encouragement to hold on. SAN ANTONE saved ground well off the pace on the opening turn then eased out with a
bid into the backstretch, progressed in the three path of the far turn, dug in through the lane to take second late stretch and was gaining steadily on the
winner. CIELO AZUL stalked three wide and moved to even terms into the backstretch, dueled from the three eighths pole, remained a factor off the rail on
the far turn and continued close through the upper stretch before relenting the final sixteenth. ALLEN CAN DO IT ran in the three path the first turn, bid
toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the four path and finished evenly. MISSIONSNINETYNINE stalked the earlier pace two deep,
moved to even terms between horses into the backstretch and dueled from the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn then weakened. JOSEF IS
REAL settled off the pace toward the inside, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole then flattened at the rail on the far turn. BLACK STEEL rated a slim
lead inside, was met into the backstretch and dueled from the three eighths pole, then weakened at the rail into the far turn. EXCALIBUR was not a factor.
This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
DAZZLE ME saved ground the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, drew close in the three path approaching
the top of the lane, dueled for the lead mid-stretch and was inching further ahead nearing the wire. LADY MACHO rated close inside, challenged toward the
three eighths pole, took a slim lead past the pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was caught mid-stretch and grudgingly relented
later yards. TALKTHETALK stalked two deep, challenged at the three eighths pole and contested at a close disadvantage off the rail on the far turn, eased
outward into the lane and finished evenly. FUDGE CAKE rated a short lead inside, was met nearing the three eighths pole and gave chase past the pole,
but dropped back into the far turn, ran at the rail through the turn and finished evenly. SHERIFF'S KID was blocked off the rail into the first turn and settled
off the pace, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and showed little more. TAKE CHARGE TINA rounded
the opening turn in the three path, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, lost momentum at the heels of Fudge Cake midway on the far turn
then weakened. AWESOME ALANA rounded the first turn in the four path and settled close into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole
but started to fade approaching the five sixteenths. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Fudge Cake, lodged by the rider of Take
Charge Tina, but found no evidence of foul.
