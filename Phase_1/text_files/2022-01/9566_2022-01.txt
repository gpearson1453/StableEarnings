Footnotes
TOPPING had a shoe repair in the paddock, showed sharp speed to the front while well rated to prevail under steady handling. COURT AND SPARK
caught in tight and bobbled after the start, made a steady run widest from the turn for place spot. CALL WEST tracked leaders three wide to turn but leveled
off in the stretch. THE LAST OPTION raced between horses to the turn with an even effort throughout. RADIANT CASTLE came in start, tracked, never far
back to stretch but came up empty late. ARMY SCOUT dueled from two path but could not keep up and faded in the stretch run. REMEMBER THE MAINE
no speed to the turn with an inside run from the turn and stretch while no factor. WILD WILLIAM raced outside to the turn while never a factor. GOOD ONE
never contended throughout. AMANI'S KITTEN had a rail run to turn but gave in and dropped back readily. DARING DAMSEL never a factor.

Footnotes
MISS GETTY UP unhurried to turn, made an outside run into the stretch, rallied along to be going away to the wire. WINWARD FLO dueled from two path,
led into the stretch but outkicked while no match for the winner. CROSS THE T'S close up between horses to turn, raced evenly in the stretch run. HONEST
INTENTIONS raced evenly throughout with no gain in the late going. MISS SOVELIA three-four wide run into turn with a mild bid into stretch but flattened
out in the drive. ANNA'S MOONLIGHT had a tardy start and only improved position from the turn. ONE FAST ORB inside chase to turn, weakened in the
stretch run. THIS MASQUERADE never menaced. CORONADO JUSTICE broke sharp outside but through early and dropped well back. AYKIZ speed
between horses to turn but gave way readily thereafter. LALUCHADORA never a threat.
