Footnotes
SEAWARD tracked three wide, came five wide to make her bid, reeled in the leaders and kicked away in the final yards. AMAZING DANCER opened clear
to dictate terms, kept on well through a long drive but was unable to resist the winner. PAULAS GAME settled off of the inside, came four wide, angled in
entering the stretch and was making up ground. MACHISIMA settled in hand, shifted out leaving the second turn, bid between rivals, but flattened in the final
furlong. VOW SAVER was shuffled back at the start and unhurried into stride, rallied between foes in the stretch but failed to seriously threaten. SMARTY
ARTIE contended in mid pack to the second turn and tired. PRINCESS D'ORO chased to the stretch and retreated. BIG LIZ failed to respond. TAMI ANN
was allowed to settle, came four wide but lacked a response when called upon.

Footnotes
SLIABH AUGHTY (FR) attended the pace along the inside, moved up on second turn, shifted out and took dead aim entering the stretch, wore down
ALTMEISTER and edged clear. ALTMEISTER opened clear to dictate terms, dug in to meet the challenge entering the stretch, was unable to resist but
fought on well for the place. HELLORHIGHWATER was allowed to settle, looped into the stretch five wide and was making up ground. CAPTAIN
FANTASTIC was allowed to settled, ranged up four wide on the second turn, loomed a danger a quarter mile out, but failed to sustain the drive.
BELAFONTE settled saving ground, took closer order on the second turn, but flattened in the drive. GONE ROGUE was allowed to settle, came widest into
the stretch and finished with a belated improvement. PINBALLER was close up three wide, but faltered between rivals after six furlongs and faded. MAJOR
FRONTIER was forwardly placed off of the inside, but came up empty on the second turn and dropped out. ALPHA DOG failed to respond. THE BLUE
DRAGON pulled to contention between horses for six furlongs and caved.

Footnotes
C V THUNDER settled saving ground, moved up through the turn, got through entering the stretch, came to level terms a furlong out and kicked away.
SUPER LUCY came away a bit slow, was allowed to settle, moved up between horses, came four wide, split horses and finished well. GUILDER sped clear
to set the pace, drifted out leaving the turn, weakened during the drive and settled for the minor award. NEVER KNOW CHRISTY tracked three deep,
loomed a danger leaving the turn, but flattened in the final furlong. DE BOLT LIGHT was hustled along four wide, came five wide but failed to make
headway. FANTASTIC RIVA contended between horses to the stretch and weakened. EIDA'S STORM was allowed to settle, came six wide but failed to
threaten. ZIGGY'S STORM was close up, came three wide, but faltered between foes and retreated. BEARS BREECHES failed to respond. JAMIN'S JET
was allowed to settle, lacked a response when called upon. HOT N SWEET showed little, bled, was eased to the wire but walked off. PER THE KENTUCKY
RACING COMMISSION, DE BOLT LIGHT HAS BEEN DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
ALYDIVA perfectly placed inside throughout, roused stretch to go clear. FATE FACTOR speed to the front from inside, stayed to deep stretch proved best of
rest. ROGUE TOO had a terrible trip from the start, steadied along inside backstretch and up in the stretch for show. BUMBLE OF LOVE raced between
horses to the half while never far back with no late kick when called upon. NEW ROO tracked from three wide to far turn but emptied out in the stretch.
GOOD FIGHT never far back to far turn, rallied with a four wide bid into stretch but flattened in the drive. YLIKEDIS no speed to far turn and no late run
when needed in the drive. CHAMPAGNE TOAST never factored. SAY HEY (FR) dueled from two path for a half but gave way readily thereafter.
