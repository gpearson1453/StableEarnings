Footnotes
ROCKDALE rushed in the opening furlong to set the pace, inched clear under his own power through the turn, then drew off through the lane under mild
urging. MAXIMILIANO pressed the leader from the outside early on, but failed to keep pace while under mild urging around the turn, then held place while
hanging on his left lead. DA GOLD ROOM tracked two wide, but lacked a bid through the lane and failed to reach a tiring foe for place. KYLE'S BRO JIMMY
broke a bit outwardly at the start, raced off of the pace in the three path around the turn, tipped four wide in upper stretch, but failed to threaten. CHARMING
BULLET never got involved. HOMELAND MESSA was outrun. THIRTYEIGHTCALIBER chased two wide before clearing an inner foe into the turn, then
weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
TREASURY set a clear pace in the two path around the first turn before tucking to the rail into the far turn, met CRIMINAL DEFENSE's bid entering the lane,
but repelled that foe in upper stretch, drew clear approaching the final furlong, then inconsequently jumped over hoof marks in the final sixteenth. CRIMINAL
DEFENSE tracked along the inside, gained around the far turn before smoothly tipping outside of the leader turning for home, ranged up to bid entering the
lane, but was repelled in upper stretch, and held place. U S NAVY CROSS bobbled slightly at the start before being bumped by an outer rival, trailed the
field around the first turn, swung two to five wide entering the final three-sixteenths for clear racing room outside of rivals, then rallied to claim show shortly
after, but did not have enough to reach place. OUTLIER tracked the pace two wide around the first turn, then four wide around the far turn, but lacked a kick
through the lane. SCIENCE (IRE) laid off of the pace three wide, tucked to the two path entering the backstretch, then failed to factor. GIMME SOME MO
stalked outside of the leader while in the three path, but was outmoved by an inner foe turning for home, then weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
I LIKE DREAMING mildly shied inwardly from an outer foe at the start, stalked along the inside, inched closer down the backstretch to be just behind the
leading pair, smoothly split those rivals at the five sixteenths pole to bid for the lead, then assumed command at the furlong grounds, then drew off on his left
lead under mild urging. MORE HARDER trailed, gained in hand in the two path around the far turn, rallied while shifting to the four path entering the lane,
but lugged inwardly from right handed pressure at the three sixteenths pole, sustained stride and split foes passing that marker, brushed an inner
CLASSIC'S OMEGA inside the final furlong, then stayed on to claim place in the final sixteenth. RY DONT LIE broke a bit inwardly, set the pace inside of a
pressing rival while rank around the first turn, but settled into stride down the backstretch, then met I LIKE DREAMING's challenge at the five-sixteenths,
gave way at the furlong grounds, then lost place in the final sixteenth, but saved show. CLASSIC'S OMEGA rated far off of the pace along the inside, gained
position at the five furlong pole, saved ground around the far bend as well, then stayed on mildly, but was brushed by an outer rallying foe inside the final
furlong, and missed reaching show. MAGIC ICE pressed the pace setter from the outside, but was outmoved by an inner foe while being floated three wide
turning for home, and faded through the lane. RUNWILDWITHDREAMS settled off of the pace two wide, improved entering the backstretch to a midpack
position, chased in the three path around the far turn before drifting to the five path entering the lane, and weakened on his left lead.
ANYOTHERQUESTIONS tracked in the three path around the first turn, but faltered down the backstretch to race at the rear of the field into the far turn,
then passed tired foes in the lane. MAGNOLIA RIDGE laid off of the pace three wide, but lacked a response around the far turn before tiring on his left lead
through the lane. ROCK STAR ALEX raced off of the pace four wide, and never got involved.

Footnotes
STITCHED set the pace inside of a pair of pressing foes down the backstretch, then inside of only FIGHTVILLE turning for home, shook clear of that foe in
upper stretch before shifting inwardly from a right handed shoulder tap approaching the final furlong, but hung on his left lead and lugged inwardly from right
handed pressure at that marker requiring rider correction to keep from bumping the inner railing, then clung to an advantage from a pair of outer bidding
foes in the final sixteenth, but got nailed on the wire and dead-heated for the win. MATH MAN tracked two wide and from between horses, tipped three wide
entering the far turn, then four wide at the quarter pole, rallied outside of troubled foes at the furlong grounds, sustained his charge to bid in the final
sixteenth, and dead-heated on the wire. VASILEVSKIY (IRE) stalked along the inside, chased entering the lane, shifted outside of the inward lugging leader
at the furlong grounds, but was not clear of an outer TIZABIGMICK at the time, bumped that rival and interfered another outer foe in the process, kept on to
produce a bid between horses in the final sixteenth, but miss-timed the bob. FIGHTVILLE tracked four wide before advancing into the backstretch to press
outside of the leading pair, bid for the lead turning for home, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart in upper stretch, then steadied between
horses when put to tight quarters at the furlong grounds, and continued to give way. TIZABIGMICK pressed the pace two wide and from between horses
into the backstretch, failed to keep pace with those foes turning for home, sustained his chase in upper stretch, but was bumped by an inner VASILEVSKLY
(IRE) at the furlong grounds, was jostled and steadied between horses due to the incident, and faded. HERO DRAGON was off slowly while bumping the
gate at the start, and never got involved. SWEET DREAMS BABE stalked three wide, lost position to inner foes approaching the five furlong pole, then took
the far turn four wide while off of the pace, and weakened. ACHILLES trailed by a distanced throughout, was sharply eased through the final furlong, and got
vanned off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, VASILEVSKIY (IRE) WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FIFTH

Footnotes
VALERIE VALESKI sped clear early on, managed a loose lead in the three path around the turn, then tired in the final sixteenth, but lasted safely to the
wire. KATIE'S KARAT laid off of the pace while off of the rail, shifted three wide entering the lane, stayed on to claim place from tiring chasers passing the
furlong grounds, and was cutting into the clear leader's margin late. SPY A STAR broke outwardly, trailed early on, tipped two wide into the turn to pass a
faltered foe, the four wide in midstretch, and moved up outside of tiring rivals. ZERO POINT ZERO stalked two wide, chased the clear leader through upper
stretch, but was outkicked for place passing the furlong pole, and lost show late. SNEAK PEEK stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase in
upper stretch before fading. FANDANCER broke a step slowly, raced off of the pace along the inside, and was done early.

MAGA MAN set the pace along the inside, clung to a minor advantage from a pair of outer bidders turning for home, inched clear of them passing the
quarter pole, then held from a re-bidding CITY PARK in the late stages. CITY PARK settled off of the pace two wide, advanced entering the backstretch to
press the pace three wide at the nine-sixteenths pole, ranged up to bid turning for home, but hung on his left lead and briefly failed to keep pace with the
inner leader in upper stretch, switched over passing the three-sixteenths marker, fought on through the final furlong to produce a late re-bid, but was denied.
JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT tracked along the inside, saved ground before vacating the rail entering the lane, chased three wide in upper stretch, drifted multiple
paths outwardly at the furlong grounds while stalling his charge, but kept on late to prevail over inner foes for show. PAYDAY TOO saved ground at the rear
of the field, improved along the rail to bid for show at the sixteenth pole, but was outfinished by an outer rival for that position. JACI'S ROYALTY stalked two
wide, bid for the lead turning for home along with an outer CITY PARK, but failed to keep pace with that rival and the inner leader passing the furlong
grounds, gave way, and lost show to rivals on either side in the final sixteenth. RELUCTANT WARRIOR stalked three wide, retreated to a midpack position
approaching the half mile pole while two wide and between horses, then got floated to the three path entering the lane before fading passing the quarter
pole. RUN ROCKET moved his head just before the start and was off slowly, raced at the rear two wide, and never got involved. IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT
settled off of the pace three wide, gained to a four wide tracking position approaching the nine-sixteenths pole, but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
ANNA VOLANTE set the pace inside of a pressing WHISPERED KISS, met that foe's bid turning for home, but shook clear at the three sixteenths pole,
shifted off the rail approaching the furlong grounds, and lasted from an inner oncharging rival late. JOAN'S WAY trailed along the inside, chased from the
three path in upper stretch, shifted to the rail at the furlong grounds while picking up stride, rallied inside of foes to attempt a late bid, but ran out of ground.
CHIONE stalked along the inside while in the two path around the turn, tipped outside of the leading pair entering the lane, but lacked a kick to produce a
bid, chased the leader home, and was outkicked by an inner foe for place in the final sixteenth. WHISPERED KISS allowed an inner foe to dictate terms
early on, pressed that rival into the turn before bidding at the five sixteenths pole, but tired in upper stretch. FINE COTTON tracked two wide, came under a
drive into the turn while in the three path, briefly inched closer turning for home before being fanned four wide entering the lane, weakened shortly after
before awkwardly changing leads in upper stretch, then wandered about approaching midstretch while continuing to fade.

Footnotes
JIMMY DAN stalked along the inside, then two wide behind the leader around the far turn, smoothly slipped inside of that foe passing the quarter pole,
kicked clear at the three sixteenths, and was wrapped up through the late stages. HIGH DEFF (FR) took a bump from an inner foe at the start before
avoiding an outer troubled foe, stalked two wide, ranged up three wide around the far turn to bid entering the lane, but was outkicked by an inner rival in
upper stretch, and was second best. SAILOR'S RETURN vied for the lead two wide, cleared at the five sixteenths pole, met an outer bid from HIGH DEFF
(FR) entering the lane, then an inner bid from JIMMY DAN passing the quarter pole, and yielded between those foes in upper stretch. TONAL IMPACT
trailed in the two path around the first turn, then three wide into the far turn, and moved up without threatening. MASTER MCGRATH veered inwardly at the
start requiring rider correction, then saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. BEAU NOIR (IRE) vied along the inside of SAILOR'S RETURN, but faded
around the far turn, and weakened through the lane. INFLUENTIAL bumped an outer foe at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, and tired.

Footnotes
KICK N KISS settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path entering the lane, but was floated out to the seven path by an inner foe in
upper stretch, rallied outside of foes to bid at the sixteenth pole, and drove clear. LUCKY LINZ stalked four wide, then three wide from the four path around
the turn, bid at the quarter pole, led in upper stretch, but offered little resistance to an outer surging KICK N KISS at the sixteenth pole, and saved place from
an inner rival. BLONDIE LOX BABE tracked along the inside, shifted to the three path while chasing passing the three sixteenths pole, and stayed on to bid
inside of LUCKY LINZ for place late, but missed. KEHRON'S CREED saved ground far off of the pace, improved before tipping to the five path in upper
stretch, but lacked a kick to split foes at the furlong grounds, and kept on thereafter. GILDED APPLE stalked three wide, then from behind the leaders while
in the three path around the turn, but failed to split those foes at the quarter pole when put to tight quarters, altered out shortly after, but drifted to the six
path at the three sixteenths, then lacked a bid. PEACEFUL VISION vied for the lead two wide from the three path, then from between horses entering the
lane, but faltered at the furlong grounds. ACTIVE GIRL broke slowly and trailed the field early on, took the four to five path around the turn before fanning to
the eight path entering the lane, and improved outside of rivals. TUFFOLOGY was also slow to begin, raced far back four wide around the turn, and failed to
factor. OMA LEE took the turn in the three path and between horses while off of the pace, and faded turning for home. FANCY MALLORY tracked the pace
five wide, but faded around the turn. ELLA'S LIL STAR broke through the gate without running-off, was quickly re-loaded without further incident, then vied
inside of PEACEFUL VISION while a path off of the rail around the turn, and weakened passing the quarter pole.
