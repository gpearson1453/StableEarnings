Footnotes
LADY OF THOROTON broke in then bumped with a foe and was off a bit slow, was urged along towards the rear, advanced while moving from the two path
to the four path on the turn, gained five wide into the stretch, took over at the three-sixteenths, shook clear into the final furlong and drew away under steady
urging. FROSTY INVASION showed good speed, set the pace under some pressure, moved clear with five furlongs to run, was asked while challenged
again in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner under a drive in upper stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. ROZ
pressed then chased the pace on the outside, re-engaged the leader in the three path on the turn, vied under a drive into upper stretch, dropped back into
the final furlong and tired while just able to get the show. WRITE THE CHECK bumped with a foe shortly after the start, angled in under urging urging,
moved closer to the rail around the three-quarter pole, chased inside on the turn, moved out behind the leaders in upper stretch and capitulated.
BEAUTIFUL BANKS broke in and hit the gate then bumped with a foe while off a bit slow, bumped with another opponent shortly thereafter, settled near the
rear, was urged three then two wide on the turn and failed to respond. FALSE HOPE was bumped at the start then came outward, settled off the pace,
dropped back under urging while three then four wide on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under a strong drive and had nothing left. CARA'S
DAYDREAMER was bumped at the start then forced in and off a bit slow, moved up under urging, dropped back late on the backstretch, saved ground on
the turn and retreated then was pulled up injured after the wire and subsequently vanned off. BANKSAMILLION tracked outside under coaxing, dropped
back with five furlongs to run, fell further back in the four to five path on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
SIBELIUS hustled from the gate, ranged up inside to establish the front shortly after the break and show the way in hand three paths off the rail, tucked
briefly to the two path before taking to the inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in
under threat and just lasted on the wire. CHOWDA coaxed from the start, chased four paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path
through the turn getting placed to coaxing midway, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied to latch on the leader inside the eighth pole, steadily whittled
away at that rival to the finish but just missed at the end. CARROTHERS lunged through the stall door beating the gate a click before the latch was sprung,
chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled in to take the inside route into upper stretch and ran on through to the finish.
TWELTH MAN six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide
for home and offered no response. HOLD THE SALSA broke awkwardly brushing the near side stall at the start and getting away last conceding four
lengths to the front, raced eight paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and made
no impact. FLATTER ME PLEASE lunged at the start getting away awkward and conceding two to three lengths to the front, chased along the inside under
a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and tired. RYAN'S CAT forwardly placed five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked
three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. There was a Stewards' Inquiry focusing
on CARROTHERS at the start. After review, it was determined that CARROTHERS had beaten the gate at the start and as a result CARROTHERS was
disqualified from third and placed last prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
NEW YORK BANKER was hustled from the start, angled in while going to the front then moved clear, went around the turn in the two path, was challenged
by the runner-up into the stretch then headed, fought back under the crop, regained the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and moved clear late under
strong handling. NEW YORK SUPREME bumped with a foe at the start, settled off the pace, gained while moving from the two path to the four path on the
turn, made a bid at the quarter-pole then took the lead, led under a drive until outside the sixteenth-pole, lost the advantage back to the winner at that point
and was outfinished but held the place. INOUAINTALKINTOME was well placed behind the clear leader, chased in the three path on the turn, dropped to
the rail under a drive into the stretch, pursued the leaders into the final furlong, moved out at the sixteenth-pole and missed the place while clear for the
show. LIVE IN FIVE bumped soundly with a foe at the start, raced near the middle of the field, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two
path and improved without threatening. LOVE'S MISERY jostled with a foe near the five-eighths, settled off the pace, dropped back four wide leaving the
backstretch then moved to the two path, remained in the two path through the turn and lacked the needed response. WAR IN PARADISE broke in and
bumped hard with an opponent, settled early then was taken in hand behind horses, dropped back at the nine-sixteenths, went two to three wide on the turn
and failed to rally. FORTUNE'S SISTER was bumped hard between horses at the start then taken up in tight, saved ground towards the rear and never
reached contention. TORREN'S TALE broke out then was hustled, jostled with a foe around the five-eighths, went four to five wide on the turn and came up
empty. BONANA FANNA FOE was bumped solidly at the start then forced into another foe, jostled with a rival early, was urged at the rear, raced inside
early on the turn then shifted three wide, moved to five wide late on the bend and failed to threaten. ESCAPOLOGY broke in and bumped solidly with a foe,
jostled with that same opponent early, was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and was no factor. SPUN FOR LU LU was hustled from
the start then urged along off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, continued to retreat in the three path on the turn and faltered then was eased
in the final furlong but walked off.

advantage five furlongs from home, tucked to the two path and emerged with sole command through the turn getting placed to coaxing with five-sixteenths
remaining, spun three wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. AMERICAN MONARCH broke out at the start and was corrected getting
bumped lightly due to pressure from FITZPATRICK to the outside, led early on before knocking heads from the two path with the aforementioned foe to his
outside, tucked inside into the turn and was shaken off, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered two to three wide for home, proved no match for
the top one while along well clear of the rest and second best. RISK PROFILE coaxed from the gate, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then three wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened while along for the
show honors. MARKET ALERT got bumped at the start by FITZPATRICK and in turn bumped SEND THE WORD into SOUND MONEY pinching back

path through the turn getting pushed along with seven-sixteenths to run, went three to four wide at the top of the stretch and tired. SEND THE WORD got
bumped and pinched at the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and made no impact.

Footnotes
STRIKING SPEED tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, made a bid under the crop outside the five-sixteenths, took over
outside the quarter-pole then moved clear, remained clear under a drive into the final furlong and held with a diminishing margin under steady urging.
FOREVER WICKED settled off the pace, advanced five wide under urging on the turn, chased the winner in the stretch, gained on that foe late and finished
willingly but missed while well clear for the place. CONFECTIONER moved around an injured foe at the three-quarter pole, went three wide on the turn,
came five wide into the stretch and improved for the show. LOKOYA ROAD settled off the pace, saved ground under urging on the turn, moved out in upper
stretch then drifted out some more and lacked the needed response. SCOTTY was urged along at the rear, went four wide on the turn, came inward under a
right-handed crop in upper stretch then switched to a left-handed crop and failed to threaten. JACOBA raced well back in the field, started the turn in the two
path, dropped to the rail near the five-sixteenths and failed to threaten. MACHO BOY broke alertly then was hustled, showed the way down the backstretch,
vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead under urging outside the quarter-pole and tired. RESPECT FOR ALL angled in while off the pace, traveled
around the turn in the two path, swung six wide into the stretch, drifted inward near the furlong marker and was no factor. KID CHOCOLATE broke a bit
slow, moved out towards the rear around the three-quarter pole, went four wide early on the turn then moved to six wide, came seven wide into the stretch
and failed to respond. A COLT NAMED SUSIE chased the pace on the outside then in the four path on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and faded.
SPEECHIN N TEACHIN was urged along towards the back, saved ground on the turn, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole and was no factor.
OBSESSED suffered an injury approaching the three-quarter pole and was pulled up then vanned off. MR. BRIGGS moved up under urging, dropped back
leaving the backstretch, came up empty on the turn, floated five wide late on that bend and was pulled up then vanned off.

AMERICAN GENTLEMAN six then five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a
challenge through the final furlong taking command a sixteenth out, then edged away to the finish to prevail. TRASH TALKER hustled from the gate, dueled
from the two path with KING JAMES to his outside, shook away a bit into the turn tucking along the inside and was under pressure from that rival through
the bend, spun just off the inside for home, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat and was caught a sixteenth out, ran on
safe for the place honors. EXTREME hustled from the start, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper
stretch and kept on to secure the show honors clear of the rest. JAKE ROCKS chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. COLORMEPAZZI took the overland route seven paths off the inside down the
backstretch and six wide through the turn, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. SUBSIDIZE
hustled from the gate, chased four then three wide coaxed along from midway on the turn, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened. ONE
WHIRLWIND RIDE five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled in to spin just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.
KING JAMES coaxed from the start, dueled from the four path with TRASH TALKER to his inside, tucked to the two path and pressed the leader through the
turn put to brief and light coaxing inside the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home, had the rider pause in hand and was protected through to the
finish while backing away to the end.

squeeze through at the furlong marker, continued in tight quarters into the final sixteenth, bumped with ESOTICA while trying to make room late and got up
for the place. ROSSA VELOCE broke in and bumped with a foe then was bumped by another rival and forced in, established a good position just off the
pace, dropped back along the rail on the turn, turned into upper stretch in the two path and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. GRUDGE

MY BOY TATE bumped at the start by SARATOGA PAL, who broke inwards, chased three then two wide advancing in tandem with CHESTERTOWN to his
inside through the latter portion of the turn, had ALPHA CHI RO come inwards slightly just outside the quarter pole and steadied lightly off that rival before
gaining a lane as that foe swung three wide, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, had CHESTERTOWN come off the inside slightly and was bumped
by that rival and placed in tight getting bounced between foes at the three-sixteenths before ALPHA CHI RO got impeded by the coming inwards BATTLE
STATION under a right handed stick, got brushed by that rival and came inwards under a right handed crop pushing CHESTERTOWN back to the fence
forcing that rival to steady a furlong out, emerged head to head with LOBSTA from that fracas taking narrow command a sixteenth from home and gamely
prevailed at the wire. LOBSTA just off the pace four then five wide, got set down spinning five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out,
dug in and was headed a sixteenth from home and fought on to the finish. BATTLE STATION coaxed from the gate, raced three to four wide in closest aim
of the leader, swung four wide into upper stretch and came in three wide straightened away under a right handed stick, came inwards under repeated right
hand crop work forcing APLHA CHI RO to check just inside the three-sixteenths and then placing MY BOY TATE and CHESTERTOWN in tight along the
inside near the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages to the finish. CHESTERTOWN chased along the inside coming under coaxing nearing the
five-sixteenths, was along the inside at the quarter pole before floating out slightly to the two path straightened into upper stretch bumping and brushing MY
BOY TATE in concert with ALPHA CHI RO near the three-sixteenths as three rivals now jostled for two paths, got steadily nudged back to the rail as MY
BOY TATE came inwards under a right handed crop under pressure outside from BATTLE STATION coming inwards under a right handed stick and was
forced to steady along the rail at the eighth pole, tipped out inside that station and weakened to the finish. SARATOGA PAL broke in at the start bumping
MY BOY TATE, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. ALPHA CHI RHO
coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled in from the three path forcing MY
BOY TATE to steady just outside the quarter pole before tipping back three wide into upper stretch, came in slightly straightened away and brushed and
bumped with MY BOY TATE near the three-sixteenths as BATTLE STATION applied tightening coming in from the outside, had that rival take to the path
directly in front and was forced to check off his heels just inside the three-sixteenths, then weakened through to the finish. There was a Stewards' Inquiry as
well as a trio of claims of foul by the rider and trainer of CHESTERTOWN alleging interference against MY BOY TATE and by the rider of ALPHA CHI RO
alleging interference against BATTLE STATION. After review it was deemed that MY BOY TATE had caused interference against CHESTERTOWN and as
a result MY BOY TATE was disqualified from first and placed fourth. The objection against BATTLE STATION was dismissed prior to the result being
declared official.

Footnotes
RIBOT'S VALENTINE tracked the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, took the lead while roused for her best into upper stretch and drew away
under strong urging. ROYAL CURRENCY bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, moved out leaving the backstretch, went three then
four wide on the turn, turned five wide into upper stretch under a drive and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. DARN THAT SONG
angled in while urged along, went two then three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and narrowly missed the place while clear for the
show. TRUE EMPRESS was reluctant to load, raced off the pace under urging, went three wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. BELARUS settled off the pace, saved ground under urging on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. EASY PLAY was urged
along just off the pace, chased in the two path on the turn and came up empty. CELINE THE QUEEN bumped with a foe at the start, contested the pace on
the outside of a rival while loosely between horses, vied in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and tired. GEORGIE'S LADIES broke a
step slow, was ridden along off the pace, went four then five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, drifted in near the furlong marker and failed to
respond. TWIST JUST RIGHT broke a step slow, was urged along on the outside, went six wide on the turn and showed little. CHIARA contested the pace
on the inside of foes, dropped back into upper stretch and faded. PLAYMAGGIEFORME was ridden along near the back, rounded the turn in the two path
and was outrun. MRS. BANKS was ridden along towards the rear, went five wide on the turn, moved out around the sixteenth-pole and also failed to
respond.
