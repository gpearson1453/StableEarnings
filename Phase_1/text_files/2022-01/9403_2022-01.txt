Footnotes
BEACH KITTEN broke ibn mid pack, moved up to contest the issue into the first turn outside, worked way to two path by late in that bend, showed the way
up the backstretch, shrugged off a bid from a rival midstretch, drifted out with a sixteenth remaining as RED QUEEN was lugging in resulting in that one
being checked up, narrowly held ZAZZY ZAZZY DAZZLE safe in the waning strides. ZAZZY ZAZZY DAZZLE lacked early foot, began to advance far turn,
angled out four wide turning for home, rallied down the middle of the strip to narrowly miss at the wire. I FEEL THE NEED off a step slow, fell further back
when continuing to race sluggishly, saved ground through the second turn when beginning to pick up the pace, continued to display some late interest up
the inside through the lane, steered out late and continued willingly to the wire. RED QUEEN moved off the inside when forwardly placed out of the first turn,
three wide through the second turn, moved a bit closer past the furlong marker, began to lug in soon after then checked up when BEACH KITTEN drifted out
with a sixteenth to run, finished up evenly when clear. KEEN CONTENDER lacked speed, middle move up the inside to challenge into the far turn, vied into
the stretch, weakened final furlong. BURROW DOWN settled off the early pace inside, in the two path in the second turn, failed to respond in the drive.
POOLSIDE MANNERS four wide in the first turn when well off the pace, failed to menace. BUNNIE RAE steadily faded outside. BURNING BUSH steadied
in the first turn when forwardly placed, stopped after a half, finished far back while being jogged in. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING
THE STRETCH RUN AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF RED QUEEN AGAINST BEATCH KITTEN FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH,
THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED FOURTH.

Footnotes
CAPTURE THE GLORY took command soon after an alert break, set the pace in the two path, raced in the run up the backstretch, dropped to the rail late in
the final turn, maintained A comfortable advantage to the wire under steady handling. V. I. P. WHO also forwardly placed from the start, three wide much of
the way, chased the winner into and through the stretch, could do little with that one, clearly second best. ZITMAN lacked speed early inside, in some traffic,
late in the final turn, finished up best of the rest while not a threat to the top pair. TIZ SHOWBIZ last away, trailed early, continued back far turn, angled out
to be four wide turning for home, improved position through the lane. PEPPER PIKE in mid pack while racing off the inside, saved some ground second
turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response. EAGLE PASS void of speed, swung out to be four wide turning for home, also found
wanting in the run down the lane. SLICK SILVER in mid pack when a bit rank in the first turn, continued in the main body in the run up the backstretch,
closer four wide in the second turn then flattened out in the drive. PRAETORIAN four wide through the first turn, advanced four down to three wide into a
striking position late in the second bend, faltered in the drive. JACK'S ADVANTAGE chased the winner toward the inside for six furlongs and gave way.
GAMBLER behind the pace off the inside, also began to give way in the second turn. ARRIVAL was finished after a half.

Footnotes
ITSY BITSY BETTY broke alertly, allowed the pace to go under confident handling late backstretch, took over from the outside late in the bend, shook clear,
maintained a comfortable advantage through the stretch under firm right handed pressure. AIDANIKE broke a step slow, raced well back for three furlongs,
two path when beginning to advance late in the turn, split horses late and finished willingly to earn the place, not a serious threat to the winner. QUALITY
CHROME lacked early foot, advanced off the inside through the turn, bothered in midstretch when MY CORALENA came out a bit, was straightened then
was outkicked late for the second spot. MY CORALENA within striking distance off the inside, mild advance three wide late in the turn, came out when
closest to the winner with a furlong remaining, flattened out. BRIAR THICKET hesitated at the start, trailed up the backstretch as a result, improved position
through the stretch with some belated interest. GOLDEN HAMMER sprinted clear up the inside after the start, showed the way through most of the turn
while continuing to save ground, gave way when headed turning into the stretch. EDEN one paced while racing outside, was five wide exiting the turn,
lacked a closing response. CORNERS UP in mid pack for a half, tired in the drive. CHERISH THE DAY in the second flight off the inside, backed up through
the stretch.

Footnotes
SAFFA'S DAY never far back off the inside, challenged between horses late in the turn, drew clear under pressure through the lane. CHIEF RON off a step
slow, void of speed for a half, came four wide out of the turn, finished willingly to be in time for the place, not a serious threat for the winner. KHOZAN'S
SUCCESS forwardly placed outside, four wide when prompting the issue into the turn, continued within striking distance into the lane, caught late for the
place. BIG NICK narrowly set the pace along the inside, headed late in the turn, gradually weakened through the lane. TUGGLE lacked speed, angled three
wide late in the turn, improved position somewhat through the lane while not a serious threat. BEER CHASER void of speed, four wide late in the turn when
losing ground and position, regained some of that position back through the lane while not a serious threat. JUNESANDRA void of speed, passed tiring
rivals. NIP N TUCK in mid pack for a half, had little for the drive. LATIN CASINO behind the early pace inside, in tight, checked up along the rail exiting the
turn, faded. ALPINE GHOST with the early pace off the inside, began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
HOME RUN TRICK broke alertly, narrowly showed the way into the first turn in the two path, rated in setting the pace up the backstretch, moved to the
inside second turn, steadily increased advantage through the stretch under a firm hand ride to win ridden out. RYE HUMOR lacked early foot just off the
inside, dropped to the inside midway on the final turn, saved ground and improved over a couple of rivals into the lane, clear for the place, no match. CARL
G in mid pack while angling in midway on the first turn, moved closer in the three path second bend, outkicked late for the place, clear of the others.
ENGLANDER prompted the winner from the outside, chased second turn, had little left for the stretch run. EXEMPLAR void of speed, improved the middle
half off the inside, flattened out a bit in the late going, pulled up after wire, vanned off. PASAMONTE MAN raced back, came three wide out of the final turn,
improved position a bit while not a serious threat. STRIKE A BEAT second flight off the inside, raced outside, had little left for the drive. HEIRLOOM KITTEN
settled in mid pack off the inside, four wide into the stretch, backed up through the stretch. GRAND ATLANTIC chased early along the inside, stopped far
turn, trailed home, jogged in.

Footnotes
CONNIE K broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch and into the turn while in the two path, drew off through the lane under a moderate hand ride,
ridden out. BIG ON BROADWAY in some traffic into the turn, dropped to the rail late in the bend, finished willingly up the rail to annex the place. TAPIT
RIGHT lacked speed early, in some traffic while steered three wide late in the turn, tipped out a bit wider for the drive, also closed well to be up for the show.
UNBRIDLED TWISTER forwardly placed outside early, pressed into and through the turn three wide, had little for the winner in the drive, weakened to lose
the place the final furlong. KELLY BE KRUSIN off a step slow, raced back toward the inside, two path through the turn, improved position with some modest
late interest. GUEST IN MY HEART in mid pack while racing outside, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, lacked a closing response. HEATED
ARGUMENT forwardly placed early, remained in good position while dropping to the inside midway on the bend, closest to the winner with a furlong
remaining, faltered in the late going. HOT SPRINGS BLING raced in mid pack early well wide, five path through much of the turn, had nothing for the stretch
run. DOLLY DIMPLE failed to menace while racing four wide. MS SASSY ATITUDE four out to five wide trip, was never a factor. DO ME A FAVOR
forwardly placed early along the inside, gave way in the turn. BRAHMS IS WHO trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
MAGOO away in good order, track the pace along the inside, lodged a rail rally late in the final turn, drove well clear. LA FLECHA unhurried early, began a
steady advance along the inside second turn, finished willingly to be to be clear for the place, no match for the winner. KING OF STING prompted the pace
from the outside, three wide when chasing the winner into the lane, caught for the second spot a sixteenth out. DECLARE THE MOON broke back, lacked
speed while saving ground, continued inside second turn, followed the runner up through along the inside into the stretch, angled out sharply when
straightened for home to bother LOOKINFOREXCITEMEN nearing the furlong grounds, improved position. LAKE TAHOE sprinted clear the opening
quarter, set the pace in the two path into the far turn, allowed the winner the inside late in that bend then began to weaken when headed. MAXIMUM
IMPACT turned in an even trip while racing four wide most of the way. PURE ROCKET settled off the pace and the inside, came up empty when called on
for the drive. FULL ON last away, lacked speed, raced back, came four wide out of the final turn, picked off a few tiring rivals after the issue had been
decided. LOOKINFOREXCITEMEN raced within striking distance off the inside, was tiring when bothered slightly n3earing midstretch. ARISTOCAT was
finished early. SIDE BET in a bit tight at the start, was never a threat. TIGER MOON was never close.

Footnotes
COACH took command soon after the start off the inside, clear onto the backstretch, responded when headed midway on the final turn, shook that foe off
past the furlong marker and kicked well clear in a sharp effort. MISS BIGLY never far back toward the inside, raced closest to the winner up the backstretch,
moved up inside that rival to challenge in the second turn, briefly put a head in front, dueled into and through upper stretch, could not keep up the final
furlong, all out to save the place. W W FITZY off a step slow, moved up to race in the second flight the middle half, two path into the lane, set down and was
getting to the runner up late. BREEZE RIDER lacked speed in trailing for five furlongs, angled out to be four wide midway on the final turn, improved position
slightly pper stretch. WELLINGTON WONDER settled off the pace and the inside, had little left for the drive. ITSALLINTHENOTES broke on top, prompted
the issue off the inside for four furlongs and began to weaken. JOSIE dropped inside, moved a bit closer before a half then began a steady retreat while
continuing to save ground.

Footnotes
RUNNIN' RAY broke on top, set the pace in the two path, rated the middle half, drew strongly well clear late and won geared down in the final strides in a
solid effort. MYOPIC moved up to race closest to the winner along the inside before a half, chased that one in vain, proved no match through the stretch,
held sway for the place. PHANTOM DANCE settled well off the pace toward the inside, two path and behind the winner into the lane, eased out slightly to
split foes late and earn the show spot. CONTINENTAL COINS raced toward the front while on the outside first turn, continued evenly paced up the
backstretch, four down to three wide second bend, finished up evenly in lacking a late punch. NOTARY five wide into the first turn, continued outside and
was five wide again into the far bend, four wide into the stretch, also was found lacking late. MIACOMET vied up front early, continued to be forwardly
placed in the run up the backstretch, had little left for the drive as well. SACRED OATH void of speed, fanned five wide out of the final turn, failed to muster
a rally. SUN DADDY was finished after a half. CARILLO in tight then took up to lose action just after the start, raced far back, closed the gap somewhat late.
OTTOTHELEGEND came out just after the start putting CARILLO in tight, raced in mid pack for a half and faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
REGARDING THE INCIDENT SOON AFTER THE START, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.
