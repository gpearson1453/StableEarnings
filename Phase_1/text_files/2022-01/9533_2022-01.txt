A HUNK OF HEAVEN vied for the lead early while three wide, into the turn, was in a strong drive into the stretch to prove best at the end. MORO MERICA
vied for the lead between foes into the turn, battled in the stretch but weakened late. INFINITE MORO chased the pace while on the rail, made a mild bid
into the turn but failed to menace. PARABELLUM vied for the lead while inside but weakened in the stretch. A FEW DOLLARS MORE chased the pace
while four wide but needed a rally into the stretch. STONEMEISTER was slow early and dropped back behind the pack and never threatened. HEAVENLY
TRUMP trailed inside and was never a factor.
