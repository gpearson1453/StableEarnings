TURNPIKE BOB set the pace racing with a clear lead on the backside, showed the way on the far turn, responded when roused at the quarter pole, moved
up from HEARTNESS and was kept to the task. HEARTNESS stalked close up two wide, chased the winner on the far turn, could not threaten that rival,
continued gamely through the lane and was well clear for place honors. MISCHIEF ROAD raced four wide early, then settled off the pace inside, closed
mildly on the rail in the final furlong and got up for third. JUMP FOR THE WIN tracked along the inside, chased the leaders on the far turn, weakened and
was outkicked for third. YO NESSROUNDONKERN trailed the field, raced two wide on the far turn and did not factor. IFWHIZKYCOULDTALK raced three
wide early, then stalked outside a rival, chased on the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
PRINCESS EMMA JO was bumped at the start, stalked close up two wide, moved up three wide on the turn, bid four wide at the quarter pole, dueled past
midstretch, gained a short lead and dug in gamely outside of CUP OF LIFE to prevail. CUP OF LIFE raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the turn,
rallied on the rail, dueled through the lane and dug in gamely on the rail to the finish. SEIZE THE WHISKEY was very reluctant to load when the field was
loading for the first time, tracked along the inside, made a rail bid on the turn, dueled between rivals passing the furlong marker and weakened. FLY FLY
BIRD raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up between rivals at the quarter pole, gained mildly outside and got up for fourth. SHE'S A FAST ONE away
alertly to set the pace, opened up a clear lead, dueled two wide on the turn and tired in the lane. SUMMERTIME SUE raced off the pace inside, moved up
inside on the turn and then lacked a rally. DIXIE DIVA chased outside, came five wide into the lane and tired. RUBY DOOBY DOO was outrun early and
passed tired rivals. LA SUA PASTA raced off the pace inside, saved ground entering the stretch and did not factor. DON'T TELL FRANKIE was bumped at
the start, chased outside, came four wide into the lane and tired. KISSIT chased inside, raced inside on the turn and gave way.

BUCKS SOME trailed outside, bid extremely wide into the stretch then surged clear through the final eighth driving. WALK ME HOME reserved off the
leaders, moved six wide into the stretch and closed well to gain the place. LOVE IN HER EYES lacked speed in the two path then advanced inside through
the stretch. LOVE ON FIRE dueled four wide down the backstretch then flattened out late. TIZ GRACIE vied three wide with a narrow advantage, lost the
lead on the turn then weakened late. STILL ALIVE dueled along the rail, edged clear on the turn then came up empty in the final furlong. AWESOME PAL
dueled between rivals then faltered through the stretch. THIS ROUND'S MINE saved ground, moved easily on the turn then faded late.

Footnotes
LADY BREXIT was bumped at the start, tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, wore down SOUTHERN CENTS in
the final furlong and drew clear. SOUTHERN CENTS set the pace racing a bit off the inside, showed the way on the far turn, dug in gamely passing the
furlong marker, then yielded grudgingly. TOWSON hopped at the start, raced off the pace between rivals, moved up inside on the far turn, made a rail bid
entering the stretch, dug in and was outkicked. GALILEO'S AFFAIR was bumped at the start, raced off the pace with an inside trip and lacked a rally.
MOLLY'S GAME raced four wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace, between rivals on the far turn and failed to threaten. SILVER EXCESS stalked the
early pace, then chased outside, lacked a bid and faded. JOYCEE'S SPIRIT raced three wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace and gave way.

ESPERNSITA chased in the two path, angled out in the stretch, rallied and edged away in the final furlong. MAKEAJOYFULNOISE pursued the loose
pacesetter, bid on the turn, led in midstretrch but was outfinished. ROLLS ROYCE JOYCE dropped back wide, moved extremely wide on the turn and
closed willingly. MEMPHIS MAFIA saved ground throughout, led briefly into the stretch then tired. KERICS BEAUTY raced outside off the leaders and
lacked a solid rally. POWWA OF LOVE chased four wide while outrun early then drifted in tiring through the lane. ABOVE THE LIMIT broke alertly and set a
clear pace under rating then stopped in the stretch.

SECRET PATH stalked the leaders, moved up nearing the far turn, bid three wide on the turn, dueled briefly with JUST A THOUGHT, took over, drew clear
and held well under urging. HARD STING raced off the pace, advanced between rivals on the far turn, rallied outside and finished well. COMMISSIONER
DAVE was off a bit slow, outrun early, advanced at the quarter pole and rallied mildly for third. JUST A THOUGHT dueled outside for the lead, battled on the
backside, briefly gained command entering the far turn, then dueled with the winner passing the quarter pole and weakened. LAWLESSNESS raced off the
pace inside, advanced on the turn and had no rally. CATCH MY VIBE raced two wide off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn and tired. LONGTAIL
dueled inside for the lead, battled with JUST A THOUGHT on the backside, chased on the far turn and gave way. OUR LUCKY MAN ducked out sharply
after the break, was pulled up soon after and walked off. After a Stewards' Inquiry, the race was declared official.

Footnotes
THE REIGN MAN outrun early, moved very wide into the stretch and surged clear in the final eighth. ONE SLICK START settled inside, rallied briefly to the
front into the stretch but was outfinished. AMERICAN RIVER (VEN) far back early, was in tight near the three eighths pole then moved wide in the stretch.
YEI YEI saved ground, moved closer near the quarter pole and continued willingly. COUNT THE SHELLS prompted the leaders wide down the backstretch
and weakened. MOUNTAIN TREE was far behind outside then passed rivals without menacing. GRANDFIRE forced the pace inside, led briefly on the turn
then faltered. STOPIT led outside through the opening quarter then proved empty in the stretch. RISING STORM broke sluggishly, chased outside and was
no factor. ADMIRAL EASTWOOD saved ground and was never in contention. ELITE MISSION was urged close up between rivals then began fading on the
turn. PER RULING #22041PP FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, COUNT THE SHELLS WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 5th TO
UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
