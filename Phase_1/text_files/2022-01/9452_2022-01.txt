Footnotes
ONE LAST THOUGHT disputed the early pace with QUEEN'S MARQUE, was a bit wide under a tight hold on the turn while shaking free from that pressing
rival, extended the lead into the stretch run and won handily as much the best. LOVER BOY TOM chased the early pace from a two wide path on the turn,
was asked for run nearing the furlong marker and while no match for the winner was clear of the rest in the end. WIND IN HIS SAIL broke inward at the start
and brushed with LUVTHEONEURWITH, chased the pace inside of foes through the turn, angled out for the drive and was unable to muster a late rally
while on the left lead. LUVTHEONEURWITH bobbled at the start, was brushed by WIND IN HIS SAIL and was slow into stride leaving the break, chased the
pace from the rear through the turn and lacked a late response in the drive. QUEEN'S MARQUE contested the early pace with ONE LAST THOUGHT,
could not go on with the winner along the turn and gave way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
SUGAR BEETS was allowed to settle off of the pace through the backstretch while traveling inside of rivals, was given her cue nearing the quarter-marker,
was urged along in tight quarters through upper stretch, split foes inside of the sixteenth marker, brushed with AWESOME DUDE and dug in in the final
strides to prevail. MOUNT PELLIAR settled toward the rear while unhurried in the early going, improved position while three wide on the second turn,
continued that rally while widest through the stretch, vied for the lead inside of the final sixteenth and was nipped on the wire, while besting the rest.
AWESOME DUDE stalked the pace outside of rivals through the backstretch run, gained ground on the second turn, put a head in front inside of the furlong
marker, was brushed by SUGAR BEETS inside of the sixteenth marker and was outfinished in the end. HAMMERING LEMON saved ground while forwardly
placed through the second turn, vied for the lead approaching the furlong marker and gave way in the late stages. SHORT RIB was sent leaving the break
and stalked the pace through the second turn, encountered oncoming rivals on the second turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and weakened in the
drive. RAILSPLITTER was hustled leaving the start and set the fractions while being prompted, was confronted by oncoming rivals nearing the
quarter-marker, was caught and the eighth pole and weakened in the late going.

Footnotes
HERE COMES RALPHIE was a bit slow leaving the break and chased the field from the rear into the turn, swung out nearing the quarter-marker, made a
five wide bid into the stretch to quickly overtake the tiring pacesetter and surged clear in the end. ARISTEIA stalked the pace inside of rivals, chased the
leaders off of the turn while in tight quarters, improved position in upper stretch and while not able to reel in the winner was clear of the rest. MARZANNA
stalked the pace outside of rivals along the turn, was in tight quarters nearing the top of the lane while close up and was outfinished by the top pair in the
late going. ALLISON'S SURPRISE showed no speed in the early stages while saving ground and lacked a late response in the stretch run. LOVELY
HUSSAR chased the pace from the inside and weakened in the stretch drive. LADY SKYWALKER bobbled at the start, recovered to press the fast pace
from a three wide position and tired in the stretch. FEEL THIS MOMENT was sent to set the fast pace while being pressed, led into the final furlong and was
tiring when quickly overhauled by the winner and faded in the late stages. SCARLET IRIS was away slowly, showed no early speed and was not a factor.
SUGAR PLUM chased the pace outside of rivals through the turn and gave out in the stretch drive.

SEN SEN took command of the early pace and set the fractions while rating nicely through the second turn, extended the lead while being reminded through
the lane and pulled away in the end. LADY'S SERMON stalked the pace outside of rivals through the far turn, was outkicked in the stretch by the winner but
kept on to get the nod for the place. ALESHA settled off of the pace while saving ground, improved position nearing the quarter-marker, lacked room in
upper stretch, angled in for the drive and closed well in the late going while just missing for second. CARASYNTHIA stalked the pace through the second
turn, gained a bit of ground on SEN SEN nearing the quarter-marker but did not go on with that run and weakened in the stretch drive. I AM YOURS saved
ground throughout while stalking the pace, improved position on the second turn but was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
ROYAL 'N RANDO checked on the run into the first turn then stalked the pace through the backstretch run, saved ground while just behind the leaders on
the second turn, was asked for run leaving the second turn, overtook LOADED MUSKET inside of the furlong marker and drew clear in the end. SYNC was
four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace through the backstretch run outside of rivals, gained ground into the stretch, bumped with BLESSED BROTHER
inside of the final furlong and was outkicked in the late stages, while holding for second. LOADED MUSKET was away in good order and set pressured
fractions through the second turn, shook free of the pressing rival nearing the quarter-marker, extended the lead into the stretch, was collared by the winner
inside of the furlong marker and was outfinished late but kept on to save third. BLESSED BROTHER tracked the pace along the backstretch while outside of
rivals, gained ground while three wide on the second turn, continued that run into the stretch, was bumped and steadied inside of the final furlong and
finished evenly in the late going. WHOLETTHECATOUT was fanned five wide along the first turn, was allowed to settle through the backstretch run, was
five wide on the second turn and did not have a late response. THECHIEFHASTRICKS stumbled at the start, was fanned four wide on the first turn, sat off
of the pace while outside of rivals through the second turn and did not offer a late rally. FANTASTIC DREAM pressed the pace through the second turn,
came under pressure nearing the quarter-marker, dropped back at that point and was empty in the stretch run. BOB'S REIGN was erratic and hard to place
in the early going, lost ground on the run into the backstretch, was outrun approaching the second turn, was eased in the stretch and walked off under his
own power.
