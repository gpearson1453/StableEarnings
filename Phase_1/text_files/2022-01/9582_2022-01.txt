FRAN'S WORRIER led inside, repelled a challenge on the turn then drew clear and lasted while shortening stride late. IRISH COLONEL settled inside then
made a gradual gain along the rail through the stretch. ANZIO BEACH stalked the pacesetters three wide and continued willingly to the finish. YONDERING
lagged far behind then past stopping rivals. EMPIRE'S SCORE prompted the winner to the three eighths pole and gave way. GREEN MANSIONS lacked
speed and began stopping on the turn.

gained command in deep stretch and edged away at the wire. ALONZO MOSELY stalked two wide, chased on the far turn, rallied between rivals in the
stretch drive and got up for second. MR. TUTTLE set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way on the far turn, drifted out in upper stretch and tired
in the final furlong. SPARTAK was off a bit slow, raced two wide off the pace, chased the leaders on the far turn and lacked a rally. VOY A TI raced off the
pace inside, chased inside on the far turn and tired. THE METHOD stumbled at the start, raced off the pace inside and did not factor. PETER G. FOX raced
four wide early, then stalked three wide, chased and gave way.

Footnotes
FRISKY FEELING was off slowly and steadied, raced off the pace inside, advanced on the far turn, bid four wide at the quarter pole, rallied outside in the
stretch drive and drew clear under urging. HOLMDEL PARK dueled inside for the lead, battled with BLUE SHINE on the backside, dueled on the far turn,
then dug in gamely inside in the stretch run to hold second. FED POLICY stalked the dueling leaders, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled into the stretch
and was outfinished for the place spot. PECAN PATTIE lunged in the air at the break and was off slowly, raced off the pace and failed to threaten. BLUE
SHINE dueled outside for the lead, battled to the far turn, then faded. ANGEL RAPHAEL raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. ABHAILE
stumbled badly after the start and lost the rider, walked off. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the start, the race was declared official.

Footnotes
SOUPER FLY OVER vied along the inside, took over at the five sixteenths pole and drew away remaining safe under steady urging. SUPER DUDE settled
inside the dueling leaders, was asked for run on the turn but proved no match for the winner. ZIPPY saved ground close up, faded into the far turn, came
again but flattened out in the stretch. OPEN LENGTHS chased off the pace, moved extremely wide on the turn and into the stretch. KOAN broke slowest,
was fanned very wide on the first turn, raced close then weakened in the stretch. SAMARONTI trailed for three quarters then passed a fading rival. TRIFOR
GOLD prompted the winner outside to midway on the final turn and gave way.

turning for home, rallied widest, moved clear in upper stretch, then dug in determinedly late to hold off the runner up. HE RUNS THE LINE raced four wide
early, settled two wide off the pace, advanced between horses on the far turn, bid between foes, was in tight and bounced around entering the stretch, then
re rallied in the final furlong and dug in gamely inside of the winner to the wire. CALLMETHEBREEZE was bumped hard at the start, raced five wide early,
then tracked inside, chased inside on the far turn, drifted out at the quarter pole bumping rivals, then weakened. A GRAY FOR CAROLYN tracked early on
the inside, then vied inside for the lead, briefly shook free on the far turn, dueled to the quarter pole, then was in tight, bumped between rivals and stumbled
badly, weakened in the lane. GRUNTLED stalked three wide, chased on the far turn, made a mild four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, then gave way.
FACTUM LOVE STYLE was bumped hard at the start, raced off the pace inside and did not factor. ORACABESSA was outrun. SUNSHINE TOMMY set the
early pace, then vied two wide for command, dueled and gave way. There was a Stewards' Inquiry, a Jockey Objection by the rider of A GRAY FOR
CAROLYN against the top three finishers, as well as a Trainer's Objection from the second place finisher against the winner. After Stewards' review,
CALLMETHEBREEZE was disqualified and placed fourth for causing the incident at the quarter pole.
