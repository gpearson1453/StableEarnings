Footnotes
OPTIGOGO was allowed to settle early, made a steady advance towards the far turn while racing two wide, angled in through the upper stretch to race near
the rail, bumped with Bens Malice inside the sixteenth pole, dug in and just got up under strong handling. A stewards inquiry was filed to review the stretch
run and ruled no change. BENS MALICE was unhurried in the early stages, moved up strongly through the upper stretch while racing four deep, bumped
with the winner inside the sixteenth pole and finished gamely to the wire. HIGH STOCK stalked the early pace down the backstretch, raced in tight quarters
near the half mile pole, angled five wide through the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. CHAOTIC TEMPO showed good early speed to set the
pace from the inside, repelled the challenge around the far turn and weakened the a bit the final eighth of a mile. SHIMMERING LEROID settled off the early
going, shifted four wide near the quarter pole and had no late response. GRUMLEY was forwardly placed to lay up close down the backstretch and
weakened in the stretch run while racing three to four wide. VIVA VICTORY stalked the early pace, checked just past the quarter pole while racing from the
inside and tired. Viva Victory claimed objection for interference near the quarter pole against chaotic Tempo and stewards ruled no change.

DAILY BRIEFING was forwardly placed to lay up close from the outside, took command through the upper stretch, drew off to well clear under steady
handling and raced in hand in the final stages. JULIE'S GRACE showed good early speed from the inside to set the pace but couldn't match strides with the
winner in the stretch run. QUEEN TIGER stalked the early going, moved up four wide around the far turn and had not enough for the top pair in the drive.
WATER WIZARD settled to the middle of the pack early on, raced three to two wide in the lane and had no final winning bid. TETON THAI stalked the early
pace, raced along the inside through the lane and weakened. MA COCO settled off the early going, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no late
response. KATY AND EMMA dropped back early, raced four wide near the quarter pole and never was a factor. INERTIA raced five wide near the three
sixteenths pole and never threatened. BLAZED N CONFUSED pressed Julie's Grace early and gave way. LOVIN MY SWEET T was slow early, raced six
wide into the lane and never threatened. HARD CURRENCY failed to sustain a bid. DRILLS ECHO raced far back throughout and was eased up on in the
stretch.

Footnotes
DOS VAQUEROS showed good early speed to set all the pace and held gamely to be clear under strong encouragement. FRANKIE Z stalked the early
going, moved up in the two path through the stretch run and closed in well late. TITHED settled off the early pace, made a steady advance towards the far
turn, raced five wide in the drive and finished willingly to the wire. CHRISTMAS PRESENT was unhurried early, moved up five to six wide through the lane
and showed good late interest. BUSHIDO'S WAY pressed the leader from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. DENY settled off the early
pace, raced six wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. EAGLE KEEPER stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide near the quarter pole
and had no late response. DUTCHMEN FOREVER broke in a tangle, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start, raced three wide into the upper
stretch and never threatened. FIFTY CENTS was hustled along early and tired. PRICING EXERCISE was off very slow, lost a considerable amount of
ground at the start, a stewards inquiry was filed to review the start of Dutchmen Forever and Pricing Exercise and no action was taken.

MUSIC AMORE tracked the top pair down the backstretch while racing just off the inside, took command near the three sixteenths pole and held well to
prove best under all out pressure. SIGN AND SEAL was unhurried early on, swung out five to six wide through the stretch run and finished willingly to the
wire. WASSER settled the middle of the pack early, raced near the inside down the backstretch, was blocked near the three eighths pole, moved up four
deep in the stretch run and made a good late bid. BABY LUCK pressed the leader from the outside and weakened the final eighth of a mile.
LIFENHOWULIVIT dropped back early, moved up three wide near the quarter pole, angled in through the stretch and had no response. HER NAME IS
LOLA settled off the early going, raced towards the inside and had no response. JEFF'S ANGEL was slow early, raced four deep nearing the quarter pole
and never threatened. DERBYSHIRE failed to sustain a bid. BAD AND BEAUTIFUL was hustled in the early stages to take command from the start and
tired readily. PUERTORICAN DIVA raced far back and was eased up on in the stretch.

MERCEDES BOY stalked the early pace, moved up four wide around the far turn and finished second best. BRING ME A CHECK showed good early speed
from the outside while racing three wide, led inside the eighth pole and weakened in the latter stages. HIDE THE DEMON was unhurried early, raced five
wide near the three sixteenths pole and had not enough in the drive. EXPENSIVE STYLE was unhurried early, raced two to three wide and had no late
response. LORD BARNA dropped back early, raced three wide in the lane and never threatened. IMPERIAL KING was slow early on, raced four deep near
the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor. LIFE DON'T OWE YOU failed to respond. TENCH pressed early and gave way. PRIVET MOON vied for
the early lead and tired readily.
