HOLIDAY RAID lacked speed, faded briefly on the turn, rallied wide then wore down the leader driving. POSSEINEFFECTTOO stalked the loose
pacesetter, took over at the quarter pole, moved clear but was caught late. I'AM A UNICORN quickly sprinted clear, was collared at the quarter pole then
weakened. RISEN CHANGE dropped back outside and lacked a rally. DREAMINOFDASIES raced within range inside rival then flattened out in the stretch.
TOUCH ME NOT lagged far behind throughout. DESERTED chased inside, stopped then was eased in the final yards and vanned off.

EXIT RIGHT controlled the pace then eagerly widened throughout while kept to urging. KID MACHO trailed far behind then finished with good energy while
no threat outside. AHSAD faded before half a mile then advanced inside rivals through the stretch. OFF THE MEDS lacked speed, moved near the inside
and flattened out in the stretch. BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE chased very wide throughout and proved empty late. JAMMIN JIMTOWN chased in closest pursuit
of the pacesetter and faltered. HOLIDAY BONUS angled inside down the backstretch and faded through the lane. PER RULING #22036PP FROM THE
