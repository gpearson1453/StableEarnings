Footnotes
HAPPY CAMPER saved every inch of ground, got through to prevail late. TIZ OUR TURN loped to the front, stayed game while drifting out late. WILE E
PEYOTE good position throughout, carried out late, no gain. LITTLE KANSAS tracked outside throughout, stayed on well in the final stages.
DON'TSHOWWEAKNESS tracked pace to the stretch, gave way readily. OSAGE MOON good position to turn, while struggling in the stretch run wide.
CURLINGTON never a factor. After a stewards inquiry into the stretch run TIZ OUR TURN was disqualified from second and placed third for floating out and
impeding WILE E. PEYOTE in the final sixteenth.

chased winner to the stretch, faltered from inside late. KING'S MISCHIEF rail trip, never made a bid throughout. ON K P had an awkward start, cane widest
into the stretch, no menace. NOTABLE EXCEPTION broke well, steadied quickly, never looks. ROUGHIN THE CITY tracked to turn off rail, gave way
readily.

wire. MIDSUMMER NIGHTS saved ground to turn, angled widest with a late run for show. CAIRO DRIVER never far back to stretch between horses, hung
late. HIGH MEADOWS had an awkward start, rushed to good position off rail throughout but flattened out in the stretch. HARD LIKE HOLLY raced outside
all the way while erratic in the stretch run. FABULOUS PHILLY chased to pair to the turn with a steady faded from quarter pole. ALL FOR SHOW broke well
far outside, could not keep up and faded. SUPER GEUSE failed to menace from outside. REGATTA COLORS rushed inside to flash speed to the turn, gave
way readily.
