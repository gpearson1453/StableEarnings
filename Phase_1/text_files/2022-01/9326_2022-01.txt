Footnotes
VIOLENT VIXEN brushed with a foe at the start, disputed the pace on the inside of two foes, vied in the two path on the turn, shook clear into upper stretch,
shied in a touch when the rider un-cocked his crop approaching the furlong marker and proved much the best under a brisk hand ride. EARLY EDITION
disputed the pace on the outside, vied three wide under urging on the turn, floated five wide into the stretch, pursued the winner while remaining on his
inside lead to the wire and was second best. CADEAU DE PAIX settled off the early pace then came under urging, went four wide on the turn, swung seven
wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response while along for the show. BOSS CARA brushed with a foe near the five-eighths, was well placed
just off the pace, chased inside on the turn, turned into upper stretch under the crop and came up empty. CAZILDA FORTYTALES broke out and brushed
with a foe then was hustled, established position just off the pace, raced off heels passing the half-mile pole, went three wide on the turn, came six wide into
the stretch and had nothing left. ENTER SANDWOMAN brushed with a foe while dropping back near the five-eighths then moved out, angled from the two
path to the five path on the turn and failed to respond. THEGODDESSOFSNAKES brushed with an opponent at the start, disputed the pace between
horses, dropped back in the two path leaving the backstretch and stopped.

Footnotes
IMPRESSIONIST coaxed from the gate, ranged up inside establishing the front to show the way lightly coaxed along in the two path, remained safely clear
through the turn widening away near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, went clear under a drive to the finish. RELATE bumped at the start by
PINEAPPLE MAN, came under hustling and chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home, proved no match
for the top one while running on clear for the place honors. PINEAPPLE MAN broke out at the start bumping the aforementioned foe, raced three wide in
closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages while
along for the show honors. CLASH A. J. broke out at the start and came under coaxing, chased three wide under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, spun just
off the inside for home and passed tired rivals. WILD CARP DIEM hustled from the start, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then two to
three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes. BUSTIN UP coaxed from the
gate, chased just off the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. THE INSTITUTE chased four to five wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths and tired. WAHEEL coaxed from the gate, chased four to five wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung five
wide into upper stretch, tired and was eased home to the finish.

five-sixteenths, shook clear coming to the quarter-pole, drew away under a drive into the final furlong and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging.
TALE OF MIST settled off the early pace then moved out, dropped in to save ground on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, angled in outside the
furlong marker and finished with good courage for the place. SPEEDING KID settled off the pace, moved out near the nine-sixteenths, was urged two then
three wide on the turn, bumped with a rival while coming out into upper stretch, came between foes shortly thereafter and lacked the needed kick while best
of the rest. BOURBON MISSION was sent hard from the start, set the pace under pressure to his inside, vied in the two path while challenged to the outside
on the turn, lost the lead outside the five-sixteenths and tired. SUMMER BOURBON was urged along off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path

turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. WINNING DRIVE settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the turn, came six wide into the
stretch and failed to respond. KAREN'S COVE was sent hard from the start, pressed the pace on the inside, dropped back into the turn, saved ground
