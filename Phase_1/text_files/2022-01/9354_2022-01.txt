BACK CHANNEL vied outside, took over into the far turn and drew away to a wide advantage while kept to a drive. IOVA broke slowest, trailed early then
advanced well inside to earn the place. THE BIGGEST ONE saved ground close up, angled wide on the turn then flattened out. POLITELY CROWNED
pressed the winner wide to the quarter pole and weakened. MISBEHAVING LADY dropped far behind then passed rivals without menacing. MISS ALEX
broke alertly then lacked speed and was never a factor. ANGELSFOUR MICHELE faded on the turn and was always outrun. CAPE COD SALLY flashed
speed in the two path and gave way readily. STARSHIP SUBWAY forced the pace inside briefly then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
BURANO stalked the pace in hand, took over into the far turn then pulled away in the stretch under mild coaxing. MIA TOSCA chased between rivals, made
a menacing bid near the quarter pole but proved no match for the winner. A CASE OF YOU rated well behind, angled out in the stretch then flattened.
MYTHREEBUTTERFLIES settled just off the rail close up and faded on the final turn. BAI BAI SAMURAI raced wide throughout and was never in
contention. NANA'S BOOPA moved closer outside before half a mile and proved empty through the stretch. POP THE CLUTCH saved ground off the pace
and weakened steadily. PRINCESS EMMA JO hustled to the front inside then stopped abruptly.

BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL trailed in hand, advanced inside, moved out rallying at the quarter pole and was in time late. JUPI'S LIGHTNING prompted the pace
outside, led on the final turn and continued gamely. WILLIAM CROTTY saved ground within range, bid on the final turn then tired. OFF DUTY set a clear
pace for five furlongs and faded through the stretch. GRAND OASIS chased wide throughout and passed rivals while no menace. PRETENDANT raced
close up early then began fading after half a mile. WICKED STRONG ALEX was reserved inside then stopped abruptly. MY MAN ELVIS dropped far behind
racing wide and was no factor. SILVER FURY prompted the pace outside to the final turn and gave way.

POWERFUL ALLY chased wide throughout then surged through the final furlong to get up in time. JAMMINWITHBRANDON saved ground throughout then
closed strongly too late. ROYAL BLUE BOY went after the pacesetter on the turn, moved clear in midstretch but weakened. FORT FORTITUDE lagged far
behind, moved wide in the stretch with late energy. MONTE NE hustled within range inside then proved empty in the stretch. TOMATER GATOR saved
ground well behind and lacked a solid rally. STREET TAIL quickly sprinted to a long lead then shortened stride in the stretch. GREEN MANSIONS broke
awkwardly, chased wide and was no factor. PER RULING 22037PP FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA HORSE RACING COMMISSION POWERFUL ALLY

Footnotes
TOMARIE rated wide, advanced strongly into the stretch and pulled clear driving. PECAN PATTIE trailed early then closed willingly wide too late.
FILLUPCOHENSAPIKER bid inside after half a mile, led in the stretch then weakened. FRISKY FEELING lacked speed saving ground then passed rivals
without menacing. HAY BUCK hustled to the front inside, lost the lead before half a mile and faded. I'M THIRSTY prompted the pace wide then faltered.
ELUSIVE RYDER broke slowest, rushed wide to the front before the half then gave way. REIGNING FIRE dropped back in the two path and was never a
factor. MANI PEDI moved closer four wide after half a mile then stopped. SUBSIDIARY forced the pace briefly then stopped abruptly.

TEXAS SWING set pressured pace, repelled repeated challenges and edged away under confident handling. SUCCESSFUL CURE stalked the winner
outside, engaged that foe on the final turn and continued willingly. ROAN MOUNTAIN rated near the inside, angled out in the stretch and closed well. FLAT
OUT FLYING trailed early, advanced inside then flattened out in the stretch. INSPIRED OPTIONS forced the pace outside for five furlongs and faltered. EL
HERMANO dropped back outside and weakened steadily. REX KWON DO chased wide off the leaders and gave way. NINE TOE JOHNNY broke slowest,
moved up inside then stopped on the final turn.

Footnotes
GYPSY JANIE prompted the pace outside, took over midway on the turn and drew away while geared down through the final furlong. FLEETERTHAN
lacked speed, angled wide on the turn and closed well outside. SHE'SMYRISENSTAR dropped far behind then picked off rivals in the stretch. BAYLEAF
was hustled up to duel inside then began weakening on the turn. COTTON CANDY CUTIE chased outside and lacked a rally. VERRAZANO VITTORIA
earned a narrow lead outside, took a bad step and bobbled nearing the quarter pole and faded. J J LOVES BILLY chased within range inside then faltered.
MORISSETTE was squeezed back at the start and no factor. THATTA BOY GIRL broke sluggishly, rushed to contention then faded. BRYCE'S PHILLY
trailed throughout losing contact with her field.
