Footnotes
MALIBU JEWEL settled off of the early pace, was four wide on the first turn, began to improve position along the second turn while three to four wide, ran in
tandem with a closing runner-up through the final sixteenth, was urged under firm left-handed encouragement and dug in to prevail in a blanket finish.
BRITE TAN tracked the early pace while saving ground, improved position while matching strides with MALIBU JEWEL leaving the second turn, closed well
in the final sixteenth and just missed for the win while holding for the place. CIRCULODEGANADORAS tracked the pace through moderate fractions, was
three wide on the second turn, gained ground into the stretch to vie for the lead inside of the furlong marker but was outfinished in the final strides by the top
pair while holding for the show. WHERE'S FRANKIE was away in good order and set the fractions from a two wide path through the second turn, came
under pressure nearing the furlong marker, was caught nearing the sixteenth marker and was outfinished in the final stages. TOTALLY NORMAL was
unhurried through the second turn while saving ground and finished willingly along the inside in the stretch but was unable to close the gap on the leaders.
LIZZY'S INTHEGAME was away a bit slow and was unhurried through the backstretch run, was four wide on the second turn, gained ground into the stretch
and was outkicked in the late stages.

CROWN KITTEN tracked the early pace from a two wide path, was roused nearing the quarter-marker and confronted QUEEN CARMELITA nearing the
furlong marker, wore that foe down and was kept to task to draw clear in the end. SMILING SPIRIT was away a bit slow leaving the break and settled three
wide on the turn, rallied leaving the bend and was up in time to claim the place. CHIRP sat off of the early fractions while two wide, closed well in the stretch
and just missed for second. QUEEN CARMELITA was away well and showed early speed while setting the pace from the inside, was confronted by the
winner nearing the furlong marker and weakened in the drive. I LOVE ROMANCE chased the pace from a two wide position and tired in the stretch run.
AMBER LOUISE stalked the pace from the inside and gave way in the stretch drive. SLEW OF FASHION chased the early pace into the turn, lost ground
while three wide on the turn and faded in the stretch.

SING IN THE WIND sat just off of the early pace through the turn, mounted a three wide bid leaving the bend to confront JENPIRESTRIKESBACK nearing
the furlong marker, battled with that game foe and dug in in the final stages to prevail in a head nod. JENPIRESTRIKESBACK was hustled soon after the
break to set the fractions, met the bid of SING IN THE WIND leaving the turn, battled back against the winner and was gamely bested in the final strides
while besting the rest. NAMORITA was a bit slow in the early going and settled off of the pace, gained ground while four wide on the turn and continued that
rally into the stretch to claim the place. SOMARA stalked the early pace, made a four wide bid leaving the turn to vie for the lead nearing the furlong grounds
and flattened out in deep stretch. COAL SHAFT chased the pace from the rear of the field and was not a factor. OYSTER SHOOTER tracked the pace from
a two wide path and gave way in the late going. CONCISE ADVICE chased the early pace, vied for the lead from the three path on the turn and weakened
in the stretch run.

DRESS REHEARSAL saved ground through the turn while stalking the quick fractions, mounted a two wide bid on the turn to confront LOVING SPIRIT
nearing the furlong marker, quickly put that tiring foe away and pulled away in a good debut. SAVAGE LOVE chased the pace from the rear into the turn,
gained ground while four wide on the turn and continued that run into the stretch while no match for the winner. TAM TRICKY was pinched at the start and
took up leaving the break, made a two wide bid on the turn, saved ground through the lane and was outfinished by the top pair while clear for the show.
ARTISAN DANCER stalked the pace into the turn, was bumped and carried out by a drifting rival and did not offer a late bid in the stretch run. HAPPY AT
SHADY broke in at the start and bumped TAM TRICKY, saved ground through the turn and did not offer a late rally. LASSIE CAT was unhurried through the
early going, was two wide on the turn and was not a factor. LOVING SPIRIT was away well and showed speed while setting quick fractions from the inside,
had a clear lead into the stretch run but was quickly collared by the winner and gave way in the drive. TRIBUTE TO JAZZ was forwardly placed through the
run into the turn, was green and drifted out on the turn and did not have a late response in the stretch drive.

HONEYMOONZ OVER tracked the quick pace from a two wide position on the turn, confronted the pacesetter leaving the turn, shook free inside of the
furlong marker and kicked clear in the end. PRINCE DE PRINCE saved ground while stalking the pace on the turn, angled out for the stretch run and closed
well to win the nod for the place. SEQUENTIALLY was pinched at the start and chased the pace from the rear, improved position on the turn while two wide
between foes and continued that rally into the stretch, just missing for second. LYMEBYRD was a bit slow in the early going and settled off of the pace,
improved position while four wide on the turn and finished willingly in the drive. PHANTOM DROP chased the early pace outside of rivals into the turn and
was gaining ground in the stretch run, though unable to reel in the leaders. SUNSET DRAGUNN was forwardly placed through the turn while three wide and
was outfinished in the drive. EXHALTING showed speed while setting quick fractions from the inside and weakened in the stretch run.

GOVENOR'S PARTY was allowed to settle through the backstretch run, improved position on the second turn from a four wide path, vied for the lead
between foes inside of the furlong marker, shook free and drew clear in the late going. FUENTE (GB) stalked the pace while saving ground throughout,
gained command nearing the quarter-marker, was confronted by the winner nearing the furlong grounds and was outkicked in the drive, while holding for
second. ROBBER BARON tracked the pace through the backstretch run, gained ground while three wide on the second turn and was outfinished in the late
going while on the left left, though just missing for second. BACK RING LUCK was away in good order and set the fractions through the second turn, drifted
out nearing the quarter-marker and tired in the stretch run. ON RAGLAN ROAD was four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace through the backstretch,
was six wide on the second turn and did not offer a late rally. RESPECT THE HUSTLE tracked the pace through the backstretch run, lost ground while five
wide on the second turn and gave way in the drive. BOTTLE OF SMOKE saved ground through the early going while settling at the rear, lacked room and
was hard to place on the second turn, clipped heels and lost the rider nearing the head of the stretch and walked off under his own power. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INVOLVING BOTTLE OF SMOKE CLIPPING HEELS AND UNSEATING THE RIDER NEAR THE

Footnotes
QUEEN OF THE TRACK tracked the pace from a ground saving position, challenged the pacesetter nearing the quarter-marker, took the lead from that foe,
was urged under right-handed encouragement through the stretch and held to prevail. DEE GEE was unhurried in the early going, saved ground through the
turn, angled out for the drive, closed with a rush in the final sixteenth but could not reel in the winner while getting up in time for the place. MAYCEE JO
chased the pace from a four wide path on the turn, gained ground into the stretch and was outkicked in the final furlong. AWESOME AMANDA stalked the
early pace into the turn from a two wide position, angled in for a rail bid in the stretch run and made a late gain though unable to reel in the top trio. SEVEN
SISTERS was off alertly and set the pace through the turn, was confronted by QUEEN OF THE TRACK nearing the quarter-marker, relinquished the lead to
that foe and was tiring while in tight quarters in upper stretch and was empty in the late going. SWIFT NONNI tracked the early pace from a three wide path
on the turn and gave way in the stretch run. VEGAN was unhurried through the early going, was two wide on the turn and was not a factor.

HEAT N REHEAT brushed with TIZ VICIOUS leaving the break and was hustled to gain command of the early pace, rated nicely through the backstretch
run while being prompted, saved ground on the second turn, was pressured in the final furlong, battled the runner-up and gamely held to prevail.
CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS stalked the pace from the midflight, mounted a four wide bid on the second turn to come within aim of the lead, kept on in the final
furlong to engage the winner, battled with HEAT N REHEAT in the final sixteenth and was gamely bested while clear of the rest. SPACE ODESSEY stalked
the pace from the second flight through the backstretch run, was in tight on the second turn while three wide, swung out for the drive and closed well under
firm handling in the final sixteenth to claim the show. SHOTGUN EXPRESS (IRE) tracked the pace outside of rivals into the second turn, lost ground into the
stretch and gave way in the late going. THATSABADBOY was forwardly placed through the backstretch run, was in tight entering the second turn while two
wide and lacked a late response. TRASH TALKIN CAT prompted the pace in the two path through the backstretch run, gained a bit of ground on the
pacesetter nearing the quarter-marker and tired in the drive. SHORT RIB was unhurried in the early stages, was two wide on the second turn, swung out for
the stretch drive and lacked a late rally. TIZ VICIOUS brushed with HEAT N REHEAT leaving the break, stalked the pace from the middle of the field while
saving ground and weakened approaching the stretch run. AWESOME DUDE saved ground throughout while stalking the pace into the second turn and
gave way in the stretch run. HAMMERING LEMON settled outside of rivals through the second turn, improved position while four wide on the second turn
but could not sustain that run and flattened out in the late going.

UNTHROTTLED was away in good order and set the pace while being pressed, rated nicely through the second turn, was pressured by BIG CITY BANE
approaching the head of the stretch but was able to shake free from that rival inside of the furlong marker and drew clear in the end. BIG CITY BANE
pressured the pace through the second turn, made a two wide bid to challenge UNTHROTTLED nearing the quarter-marker, was turned away in that effort
and was outfinished in the stretch drive, while holding for second. ORCZY (IRE) was allowed to settle through the backstretch run while saving ground, was
roused along the second turn and improved position while five wide, was outkicked in the stretch run but kept on to win the nod for third. KALINE was
forwardly placed through the second turn run while three wide, swung out to four wide for the drive, was asked for run in the late going and finished evenly in
the final stages to just miss for third. KNOWN saved ground throughout while stalking the pace, lost a bit of ground nearing the top of the lane and was
outfinished in the stretch run. CANYON CREST stalked the pace from the second flight through the second turn, lost ground approaching the
