Footnotes
ROCK SUGAR came away in good order, showed good speed, contested the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail while inside of multiple
opponents on the turn, shook clear inside the five-sixteenths, was set down in the two path into upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop inside the
furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop and was given one pop late and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. MIDASWELLRUN chased
the pace on the outside, made a bid between horses leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path on the turn, lost touch with the winner late on that bend,
pursued that foe under a drive in the stretch and was second best. LUCKY BRODY was coaxed along down the backstretch, chased inside on the turn,
turned into the stretch under a strong drive and weakened while able to get the show. FLYING WITH ANGELS broke a bit slow as the inside three horses
broke behind the rest of the field, dropped well back under urging, raced inside to the two path on the turn, shifted three wide outside the quarter-pole, came
five wide into the stretch and gained but failed to threaten. MCQUEEN'S BULLITT broke a bit slow and was last to commence, saved ground on the turn,
came three wide into the stretch, drifted in inside the three-sixteenths and was no factor. EXALTED CHARM disputed the pace on the outside, vied between
horses leaving the backstretch, dropped back with three furlongs to run and faded. RYE RUNNER broke a bit slow, angled out leaving the chute, was urged
along on the outside, advanced quickly with a half-mile to run, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the four path on the turn, dropped back late on
that bend and faltered.

Footnotes
VIOLENT POINT coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, edged clear to the eighth pole, came put to a drive under late threat and held safe to the finish. GENTLE ANNIE broke out a step at
the start brushing AWESOMENEWYEAR, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and
tipped out a path three-sixteenths from home, closed well through the final furlong but was ultimately staved off while well clear of the rest. COVER PHOTO
three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing midway on the turn, angled out six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages while along for the
show honors. EFFIEMEISTER prompted the pace from the two path coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths in the midst of being shaken off, swung
four wide for home and weakened in the stretch. MY GIRL ANNIE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under a ride from three furlongs out,
swung three wide into upper stretch and never threatened. AWESOMENEWYEAR got brushed at the start by GENTLE ANNIE, who broke out a step,
chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, tipped four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. DAZZLING SPEED three to four paths off
the inside down the backstretch, tucked briefly to the two path into the turn before floating three wide midway when placed to coaxing, angled five wide at
the head of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
FROSTED WILD RIDE was hustled from the start, set the pace on the inside under pressure, accelerated clear outside the three-eighths, responded well
under the crop in the stretch, remained clear into the final sixteenth and held under steady urging. ROOSKI was coaxed from the gate, pressed the pace on
the outside, lost touch with the winner in the two path while under strong urging near the three-eighths, pursued that foe under a vigorous drive in the
stretch, gained into the final sixteenth and earned the place but was unable to get to the winner. LADY MILAGRO broke a half-step slow from the outside
post, settled outside while not asked for speed, was taken under a strong hold with five furlongs to run then rated on the outside, went four wide while still
under some restraint on the turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, pursued the winner while outside in the stretch, gained into the final sixteenth and
finished willingly but missed the place while clear for the show. ROSEMARY POTATOES was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, dropped
back while saving ground on the turn and failed to threaten. TWEAQUED was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, tracked the pace down the
backstretch, chased between horses in the three path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. CRAZY SERENA stumbled at the start then
bumped the hindquarters of a foe and was off slow, angled in at the rear, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and was no factor.

from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, drew off under a drive to prevail. BOCA KITTEN coaxed from the start, crossed to chase just off the
inside from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and kept on along the rail to get up for
the place honors. OH MY BELLE dwelt at the start and conceded five to six lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased along the inside from near
the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out to swing four wide into upper stretch offering up a bid into contention a furlong out,
flattened out in the late stages while preserving the show honors. BEAUTIFUL BANKS bumped at the start by GIGGLING GHOST, who broke inwards,
chased along the inside under a ride from midway on the turn, spun three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. MIDMON coaxed from the
gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. GIGGLING GHOST broke in at the
start bumping BEAUTIFUL BANKS, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. LONDON PEARL

and was off a bit slow, raced off the pace under urging, lugged out leaving the backstretch and bumped with a foe, passed the three-eighths in the two path,
turned into upper stretch under a drive and finished with late energy to just miss the show. ROUGH TOUGH LOVE broke in at the start, showed the way
down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, was asked under threat from the winner outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead to that foe in upper stretch,
battled under a drive to outside the sixteenth-pole then weakened. MOSTLY HARMLESS bumped with a rival at the start then bobbed a bit while off a bit
slow, raced at the back, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn then three wide outside the quarter-pole, dropped back to the two path into the
stretch and was no factor. FLEUR ELYSE was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, moved out inside the five-eighths, went two then three wide
around most of the turn, moved to four wide outside the quarter-pole before dropped back to the three path into the stretch and also was no factor. TAP N
GLO hit the outside of the gate at the start and was off a half-step slow, was urged along off the pace, was bumped leaving the backstretch, went three to

Footnotes
SUPREME AURA broke a half-step slow, settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, rallied under a
right-handed crop, tipped out while closing fast at the sixteenth-pole and got up under strong urging. JUST RIGHT was carried in while showing speed,
tracked the pace down the backstretch, was roused two then three wide on the turn then driven four wide into the stretch, raced under an extended right-rein
in the stretch, gained into the final sixteenth and just missed while able to get the place. AMERICAN RULE was coaxed along early, moved up between foes
to make a bid with five furlongs to run, took the lead leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path for most of the turn, dropped to the two path while moving
clear outside the quarter-pole, extended the advantage under a drive into the final furlong, shortened stride into the final sixteenth and was caught while able
to hold the show. CRYPTO CASH was hustled from the start, settled off the pace, passed the half-mile pole under urging, went three then four wide on the
turn, came five wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the last spot in the superfecta. LOST IN ROME broke at the rear of the field, moved out early
then advanced under urging on the outside to stalk the pace, vied four then three wide on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and was out-kicked.
DARK STORM bumped with a foe early, was reserved off the pace, went mostly three to four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. VINTAGE
HOLLYWOOD was coaxed along on the outside, dropped back under stronger encouragement near the half-mile pole, went four then five wide on the turn,
dropped back into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. ANYTHING PAZIBLE bumped with a rival early, settled off the pace, went three then two
wide on the turn, drifted out inside the furlong marker and failed to rally. AMERICAN LINCOLN bobbled ever so slightly at the start, angled in while going to
the front then set the pace, lost the lead leaving the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back coming to the quarter-pole and capitulated.
TROUBLING MOON was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was shuffled back behind AMERICAN LINCOLN late on that bend, came
under a drive into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
RUNNINGWSCISSORS hustled from the gate, dueled to the inside of SOUTH AFRICA down the backstretch while along the rail, shook off that rival and
widened a bit through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, inched clear under a drive to the
eighth pole, dug in and held well to the finish. SCOCCIATORE two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying through to the finish but was ultimately rebuffed to the wire. BRONX BOMBER chased along the inside
under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and closed well to just get up for the show honors in the final jumps. SOUTH
AFRICA dueled from the two path with RUNNINGWSCISSORS to his inside down the backstretch, got shaken off into the turn and gave chase coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, ran on inside through to the finish. TRUE GOLD coaxed from the gate, chased
along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and weakened. GONGHEIFATCHOY four wide in pursuit, got coaxed
along with five-sixteenths to run, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and was outrun.

MY LAST MISSION tracked the pace on the outside, issued a challenge in the three path on the turn, took over into upper stretch and drove clear while
remaining on his inside lead to prove much the best. LORD BROWNIE was coaxed along in fourth position, came under stronger encouragement while
moving from the two path to the four path on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly for the place. SILVER SAMURAI
broke out then was hustled to the lead, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside while challenged on the turn, lost the advantage into upper stretch
and weakened but just held the show. EMPIRE STATION broke out and bumped with a foe, angled in near the five-eighths, raced inside to the two path on
the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved out inside the furlong marker and improved to just miss the show. WICKOSITY was bumped hard at
the start and forced strongly into another opponent then checked, raced near the back, went three then two wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch
and was no factor. MY INSPIRATION was hard ridden near the back, traveled around the turn in the two path and lacked the needed response. VIBE
SETTER paused while in tight between foes early, moved in with five furlongs to run, raced inside to the two path on the turn, came three wide into the
stretch, moved out around the three-sixteenths and failed to rally. MARTINI MARGARITA was hard ridden off the pace, went four then three wide on the
turn and failed to threaten. MANGO BEACH chased the pace on the inside of the winner, went around the turn in the two path and tired. LOOKING TO
HEAVEN was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, dropped from the three path to the rail on the turn and came up empty. KOOSMAN was
urged along on the outside, went four to five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. DANCING WITH RICO stumbled very
badly at the start and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, went three to four wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and never
reached contention.
