WAYWARDNESS sent to the front, well rationed throughout, stayed clear to wire. SUGAR HAPPY pressed winner to the half, chased while no match,
bested rest. KICK OUT THE JAMS never far back to far turn, split horses, along for show spot. CHLOE RENE inside trip while never far back, weakened in
the stretch run. RUN WITH GRACE raced back to far turn, wide run into stretch, mild bid faded. CAUSEWAY PRINCESS tracked three wide to the far turn,
gave way in the stretch. KANGAROO TALK off a bit tardy, never a threat. CONVENTIONALWISDOM widest run into first turn, close to pace to the half,
stopped.
