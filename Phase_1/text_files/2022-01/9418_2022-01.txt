Footnotes
JACK RABBIT QUICK was unhurried in the early stages, moved up five wide around the far turn and finished well in the stretch run to be well clear under
steady handling. JIMMY THE KID pressed the early leader, took a narrow lead into the upper stretch, raced just off the inside and was no match for the
winner. AKTHAM was bumped soundly at the break, settled off the early pace, angled five wide through the upper stretch and made a good late gain.
JACKSON STRONG stalked the early pace, raced three wide through the stretch run and had no late response. ALL FOOLS DAY was bumped at the
break, settled to the middle of the pack early, raced towards the inside and had no rally. LUCA DREW THE ACE stalked the pace, raced four wide into the
upper stretch and never was a factor. INTO PARADISE broke in, bumped with rival at the start, vied for the early lead while racing along the inside and tired
readily.

Footnotes
LUCKY LOVER BOY showed good early speed to cross over and set the early pace, raced in the two path through the stretch run as Doctor D J challenged
from the rail, dug in late and prevailed under all out pressure. DOCTOR D J settled off the early pace, moved up around the far turn, made a good rail bid in
the drive and just missed in a game effort. ZONIC was unhurried early, raced two to three wide in the drive and kept on to the wire. TAPSOLUTE was
unhurried early, made a quick move around the far turn, raced four wide near the quarter pole and flattened out in the drive. SEVENTY SEVENTYCAT
settled off the early pace, raced widest through the lane and had no late rally. MESA SKYLINE pressed the early leader while racing just off the inside and
gave way. SHAKEM N BREAKEM stalked the pace from the inside and tired.

stretch and was well clear late under a vigorous hand ride. ABOUT TODAY (ARG) was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced along the inside

Footnotes
U KNOW I B LION was forwardly placed to lay up close early, was coaxed along the nearing the three eighths pole, raced four wide and drove clear under
all out pressure. KENAI COOL stalked the early pace, moved up three to four wide in the lane and got up for the place position. MY SARASOTA STAR
showed good early speed to set the early pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile. MISS MIAMI stalked the pace, raced towards the inside and had no
final winning bid. MAMBO DANCER stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no response. ROLLING MO settled
off the early pace, raced towards the inside and never was a factor. HOLY DIVER was slow early and never threatened. JIMA'S GOLD raced four wide
around the far turn and never menaced.

SMOOTH AS GLASS showed good early speed to set all the pace, was challenged nearing the quarter pole, held gamely and raced well clear late under
steady pressure. GRANDMARY settled off the early pace, moved up four wide into the upper stretch but was no match for the winner. LOVIN LIVIN was
bumped at the break, settled to the middle of the pack, raced towards the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had not enough for the top pair.
MARICOPA was bumped at the break, raced near the back of the pack in the early stages, moved up five wide near the quarter pole and had no final
winning bid. TAMIAMI was bumped at the break, was forwardly placed early on, moved up three to wide through the stretch run and weakened a bit late.
BOURN WILD AGAIN settled off the early pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. D FLAT WHITE failed to sustain a bid while
racing near the inside. ROYAL ATHENA stalked the early going and tired.

Footnotes
GATE CREW was unhurried early on, moved up near the far turn, raced four wide into the upper stretch and finished well to prove best under strong
encouragement. MAGICAL ADVENTURE stalked the early pace, raced near the inside through the upper stretch, shifted three wide to race between rivals
and closed well late. FARM BOY tracked the early leader down the backstretch, challenged around the far turn while racing two and kept on to the wire.
RIDE EM was unhurried in the early stages, moved up five wide near the three sixteenths pole and showed good late interest. EMPHASIZE raced in a bit
tight near the three eighths pole, shifted out around the far turn, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no late response. GUNDUZ showed good
early speed from the inside to set the early pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile. MYSTERY MO was slow early, raced four wide into the upper
stretch and had not enough in the drive. ROSE FOR A SAINT stalked the pace along the inside and faded.
