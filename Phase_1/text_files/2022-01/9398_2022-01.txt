Footnotes
GOLDEN BOW set the pace along the rail, widened in upper stretch and held safe under left-handed urging. ALARM CLOCK hit the starting gate, advanced
three wide around the turn and slowly gained through the lane to narrow the gap. FLOR DE PLATA had speed inside of the winner, angled two wide when
that one cleared nearing the turn, stalked two wide around the bend and was one-paced through the lane. WINNING AT EASE chased the pace two wide
and lacked a rally. SWEETCANDYFACTORY steadied near the nine-sixteenths pole, chased the pace inside and faded in the lane. ANGELIC STORM
failed to menace while racing three wide. NADINE'S GIRL was in tight at the start, raced two wide and made little impact. ISLAND WINTER played no factor
while racing three wide. OVERTHEBLUESKY was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
MARCELINO pursued MALRAUX through the opening three furlongs, wrested command outside that one in midstretch and drove clear. GRAN MALBEC
saved ground early in midpack, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, and finished willingly while not a threat to the winner. MALRAUX sprinted
clear early, relinquished command to MARCELINO with an eighth of a mile to go, and weakened inside. CAPTAIN RON got bumped and squeezed back
between TRILOGY and EARTH at the start, advanced into upper stretch while shifting inside, and lacked a final bid. BORU veered out at the break spotting
the field several lengths, and remained well back outside. EARTH bumped with CAPTAIN RON at the start, raced between horses entering the turn within
range, and faded in the stretch. TRILOGY broke in bumping CAPTAIN RON, and was finished early outside.

Footnotes
MOUFFY was ridden along three wide racing off the top flight in early stages, loomed a threat to the leader around the turn, responded under left handed
pressured in the stretch run and edged away in the final sixteenth. COMEDIC vied outside of LA CASA D'ORO out of the gate, shook free to a slim lead
midway around the turn, saved ground heading into the lane, continued on top under steady encouragement and got outkicked in late stages. BALI BABY
raced between foes off the second flight heading into the turn, hustled along three wide turning for home, sustained a steady stretch bid and cleared the
rest. SHEER ALICE (GB) was not far back saving ground through early stages, shifted out late on the turn, came three wide into the lane and had no late
response. LA CASA D'ORO vied for the led with COMEDIC out of the gate, could not match strides midway around the turn but remained forwardly placed
then came up empty in the upper stretch. MULHOLLAND raced outside in the last flight and had no response. AWESOME LADY was off slow at the start,
saved ground in the last flight and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
IRON WORKS prompted the pace three wide, took over turning for home and drew off under a drive. PARTICULAR was fractious in the gate, set the pace
in the two path, was collared in upper stretch but stayed on well to be clearly second best. MASTER OF ARMS hit the starting gate, advanced inside down
the backstretch, stalked the pace from the rail around the turn, tipped out in midstretch and held third. CARRONADE steadied entering the turn, raced two
wide around the bend and never threatened. AWESOME AARON was in range three wide and steadily faded. BE ONBOARD saved ground off the pace,
steadied entering the turn, angled out soon after and made little impact. ANTHRACITE exchanged bumps with MITICO soon after the start, raced off the
pace two wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, bumped with CIANGO nearing the eighth pole and lacked any bids. CIANGO had some speed inside,
dropped back around the turn, was bumped nearing the eighth pole and continued to drop back. MITICO exchanged bumps early and played no further
factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
DEAN'S LIST broke to the lead, moved in from the two-path entering the turn, responded when hooked by DEAN DELIVERS into the stretch, brushed and
bumped with that foe through a long drive and held gamely. DEAN DELIVERS was last away after hitting the left side of the gate and bumping with
SPUNTACULAR, advanced three wide around the turn, challenged outside DEAN'S LIST into the lane, exchanged bumps and brushes to the wire and
could not get by. IN DUE TIME moved off the inside to the four-path approaching the quarter-pole, and could not gain through the stretch on his left lead.
SHASTREE chased outside the pacesetter early, and weakened before reaching the stretch. SPUNTACULAR bumped with DEAN DELIVERS at the start,
and was through early.

Footnotes
RALLY SQUIRREL secured inside position around the first turn, raced in range while saving ground up the backstretch, edged up closer late on the far turn,
tipped out two wide turning for home, roused forward to challenge PROPENSITY for the lead, cleared on top past the furlong marker, dueled inside of
TACKLE in deep stretch and nipped rival for the win. TACKLE settled near midpack three wide through early stages, launched a four wide bid near the
quarter pole, advanced to challenge RALLY SQUIRREL for the late lead, dug in gamely and got nipped on the wire. PROPENSITY cleared on top and
angled inside soon after the start, set the pace and saved ground up the backstretch, held firm through the far turn, got collared by RALLY SQIRREL leaving
the furlong marker and stayed on to clear a share. SAVOY settled and saved ground through early stages, sat patiently through the far turn, came out
approaching the head of the lane, shifted back in and had a mild improve. DOUBLE BLESSING rated off the early pace, came five wide into the lane and
had a mild improve. MAKER OF AN EMPIRE stalked up the backstretch, coaxed three wide around the far turn and steadily weakened in the lane. HOLY
EMPEROR settled through early stages, swung six wide into the stretch run and lacked a needed rally. UNCLE ARMANDO raced off the pace and saved
ground, shifted out four wide approaching the stretch and failed to kick on. CARIBBEAN GOLD stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, was ridden along
two wide through the far turn and faded entering the lane. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE

VOLCANIC contested the pace outside of CHARGE IT, dueled head to head through the lane and prevailed. CHARGE IT vied inside of the winner
throughout and just missed in a game try. TOUCH CODE chased the top two wide, was never a threat to them but held clear of the rest. ISTHMIAN hopped
at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. BERNIE LOMAX broke inwardly and bumped UNION STORM at the start, chased the pace three wide
and lacked a closing bid. LOGICO was forced to check off heels entering the turn, raced two wide around the bend and made little impact. TEN EXTRA
broke inwardly, saved ground in midpack, steadied entering the turn and had no further bids. TRENDING played no factor while racing four wide. UNION
STORM was pinched back at the start and played no factor while racing two wide. CALIPARI broke outwardly and bumped UNION STORM at the start,
raced three wide and was through early.

CLEAR VISION broke alertly, vied inside FLYING SCOTSMAN and BELGRANO early, continued to battle inside the latter through the middle stages, shook
away in upper stretch, and responded well to stay clear. VALUE PROPOSITION (GB) saved ground reserved off the first flight early, remained in striking
range two wide around the far turn, moved inside for the drive and rallied mildly to be second best. BELGRANO alternated for the lead three then two wide
outside CLEAR VISION for six furlongs, and weakened approaching the furlong grounds. LARGENT lagged near the back inside early, took closer order
around the far turn three wide, had aim outside the leaders into the stretch, and ran on one-paced to the finish. CALL CURT broke a bit slowly, was two wide
early before moving to the inside, and never factored. FLYING SCOTSMAN argued the early pace between horses, dropped off the leaders up the
backstretch, and could not keep pace after six furlongs. PHAT MAN showed little trailing throughout. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

THINKABOUTIT raced four deep in the second flight moving through the turn, sustained a steady bid into stretch run, came out wider under left handed
pressure, stayed on determinedly and got up in final strides. HANDSOME PRINCE raced in contention along the rail, remained forwardly placed around the
turn, given cue turning for home, roused forward to duel for the lead, battled on gamely and got edged out in final strides. MISH vied inside of RAISE THE
RENT around the turn, battled on with rivals into the lane, stayed on gamely and got denied late. RAISE THE RENT vied outside of MISH for the early lead,
dueled around the turn, battled on into deep stretch and lacked a final kick. DOO WOP DON raced off the top two flights through early stages, was ridden
along four wide into the upper stretch and failed to move on. ROYAL SQUEEZE raced two wide between rivals in the second flight around the turn and
came up empty turning for home. AMPERSAND was reserved and wide through early stages, continued outside into the stretch run and never threatened.
TWICE TOO MANY raced in contention positioned between foes in the second flight, began to flatten midway through the turn and continued to tired in the

MY DESTINY stalked the pace from the rail, came through inside of the pacesetter turning for home and readily drew off under confident handling.
PSYCHIC ABILITY tracked the pace two wide between foes, was in a bit tight entering the turn, raced three wide around the turn, was no match for the
winner but stayed on to gain the place. SPROUT WINGS prompted the pace three wide, bid nearing the lane, could not strides with the winner and was
outfinished for the place. AWESOME ANNMARIE lacked speed, raced two and three wide around the turn and improved position in the lane.
BARGAINAIRE was in tight at the start, raced four wide and never threatened. PUPPET MASTER was outrun while racing four wide. WORLD GONE WILD
had brief speed two wide. WILD AMERICA set the pace in the two path to upper stretch and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
TAPTHESPEEDOFSOUND quickly established command, rated along clear for six furlongs, had the rider lose the crop in upper stretch, and remained
unthreatened under a hand drive. GOOCH GO BRAGH chased outside the winner throughout, could not menace in the lane, and had enough to save the
place. HASHTAG NO WONDER was outrun early, cut the corner rallying off the far turn, and finished well along the rail. TAPIT BRIO pursued the leaders
near the three-path to the stretch, and lacked a final response. SQUEEZE ME MIKE moved off the inside to the three-path approaching the top of the
stretch, and could not gain. ABLETON saved ground on the turns, and lacked the needed response. BICKELL was a step slow at the start, and never got
close. SENSUAL CHOCOLATE broke a step slow, and was always outrun. CHARMING CHARLIE was three wide early, and had no apparent mishap.
ASTRAL WEEKS was three wide early, and retired after six furlongs. GLOBES took up sharply while hard to handle going to the first turn, got pulled up
entering the far turn, and was vanned off. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
