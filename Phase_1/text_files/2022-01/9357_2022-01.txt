angled inside the setting pace and began weakening on the final turn. BELLA G chased three wide down the backstretch and gave way. CENTERFOLD

AMERICAN ROMA forced the pace outside, took over at the three eighths pole and drew away handily. STARINTHEMAKING lacked speed, advanced
outside on the final turn and was no match for the winner. CLASSIFIED INFO hustled to a clear advantage inside, was collared on the final turn and faded.
YONDERING trailed early, moved closer before the half then had no further response. SIGHT LINE saved ground within range then gave way readily.
SPRING EMPEROR dropped back after a quarter mile and weakened steadily.

outside then proved no match but easily lasted for the place. MARIANNA QUEEN chased three wide off the pace and weakened. LONDONDERRY lacked
speed, bid on the final turn then flattened out. GO METRO GIRL dropped back early and passed fading rivals. LANA saved ground within range and gave
way after half a mile. MOMENTS TO SAVER dropped back outside and was never in contention. SERIOUS HAPPINESS trailed early and was always far
behind. SPECTACULAR NOW lacked speed inside and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
VERRAZANO BRIDGE controlled the pace, shook off challenge then widened in the stretch while kept to his task. MAJESTIC SKY raced in closest pursuit
of the winner and continued willingly. ENANO was fanned very wide on the first turn then rallied late for the show. NO TOLERANCE dropped back early
then passed rivals without menacing. ABOUT THE MULTIPLE chased off the top pair to the stretch and faltered. PREFONTAINE lacked speed inside and
was never in contention. GO SKIPPY GO trailed for three quarters and was always far behind. FRED'S GONEFISHING saved ground within range early
then stopped abruptly.

BEACH DAZE settled behind the dueling leaders, bid wide on the turn, exchanged bumps with the runner-up and outfinished that rival late. DAREDEVIL
BULL vied outside, moved clear briefly inside on the turn, was challenged from her outside, exchanged bumps and was nailed. CUP OF LIFE dueled along
the rail, eased back to the outside on the turn and faded. BROOKLYN MOJO trailed well behind and was never a factor. SEIZE THE WHISKEY led narrowly
outside to the far turn and gave way. The stewards posted an inquiry into the stretch run with no change in the order of finish. CALIENTE RUM injured
herself in the gate and was ordered scratched by the stewards.

CHARGER forced the pace outside, led at the quarter pole then held off challenges from both sides in a driving finish. MAXIMUS AURELIUS broke
awkwardly, raced wide throughout, bid in midstretch but could not get by the winner. GO LIME trailed early, rallied into the stretch and continued willingly.
THE GREAT GAZOO hustled to the lead inside, vied through the final turn and weakened. PALACE SUPERNOVA well placed behind the dueling leaders,
angled wide in the stretch then yielded. MENTALIST settled outside then weakened steadily. JOHNNY SWISH urged early, chased inside and stopped on
the final turn. CELTIC HEART was never in contention and gave way losing contact with his field.
