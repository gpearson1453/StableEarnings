Footnotes
IMTAKINITTOTHEBANK broke sharply, angled inwards forcing the pace outside a rival in the opening quarter, forged clear on the turn to open a
commanding advantage and was kept to right handed pressure to extend the advantage. RUNNING VIOLENCE, bumped by PAPA LUKE, then forced out
at the start, settled last racing to the turn, swung out four wide in upper stretch and produced a steady late rally to gain the place honors. POSEIDEN was
rated off the second flight along the inside in the opening stages, angled out three wide nearing the lane to gain some position but was outkicked for the
place honors. TIMEWON'TLETMEGO broke outwards bumping PAPA LUKE, was quickly righted, then urged disputing the pace inside the eventual winner
to the turn but soon gave way. PAPA LUKE, bumped, then crowded bumping RUNNING VIOLENCE at the start, angled inwards pursuing the leaders inside
a rival racing to the turn and emptied out early. PELUCHIN CHIN tracked off the first flight outside a rival to the bend and steadily faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
JACK RABBIT QUICK switched off the rail in the opening stages disputing the pace inside a rival, skirmished with that foe in a prolonged drive and narrowly
prevailed under brisk handling. NONA RAC was urged to terms forcing the pace outside the eventual winner from the outset, dueled grudgingly with that foe
past midstretch but was just outfinished. HEAVEN'S TALE exchanged bumps at the start, was righted to track off the leaders between foes, steadily lost
ground to that pair racing into the stretch but continued well enough to earn a share. PRIVATE CODE settled last near the inside racing through the
backstretch, swung out five wide entering the lane and gained some position while making no impact. RAL COPPERHEADROAD exchanged bumps at the
start, angled to the inside in early stages to track the leaders inside foes, shifted out nearing upper stretch and steadily faded in the drive. MERCEDES JOE
dropped off the second flight while angling to the rail on the backstretch, saved ground making some brief progress inside foes nearing the lane but had no
closing bid. ALI OWNS THE FIGHT tracked off the first flight three wide racing to the turn and steadily faded into upper stretch.

Footnotes
TRIPULANTE was urged between foes dictating the pace on a narrow advantage in the opening quarter, forged clear racing into the turn, held sway on a
commanding advantage and was kept to right handed pressure. NANTASKET BEACH, off a step slowly, was settled into stride, made steady progress three
deep racing into the turn, split foes in that path racing into upper stretch and proved best of the others. KNIGHT OFTHE CROWN, urged inside the eventual
winner prompting the pace, couldn't match that foe on the turn but continued evenly along the inside to late stages. JUPITER RAIN tracked off the second
flight along the inside, tipped outside a tiring rival racing through the turn but offered, no rally. TAP FIRST was urged three deep prompting the pacesetter to
the turn and gave way into upper stretch. VALIANT MR. tracked off the second flight outside a rival in early stages, angled inside entering the turn and soon
retreated. HAMMER D broke awkwardly, was steadied a bit when going a bit erratically in the opening stages and trailed throughout. RUNAWAY TOM
dislodged his rider and ran loose in the post parade, necessitating his late scratch.

ROUGHLY A DIAMOND was rated outside a rival tracking off the second flight in the opening half, shifted three deep entering the far turn commencing a
steady advance, wrested the advantage leaving midstretch and held sway to the end under firm handling. MYFAVORITEDAUGHTER was rated off the
second flight inside the eventual winner racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch to bid between foes in that path racing
through the stretch, shifted inside the winner in the closing stages and continued willingly to close the gap. HATARI settled outside a rival in the last flight
racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance entering the far turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and was outkicked by the top pair. MIRTH
'N MERRIMENT, forwardly placed attending a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn to gain the advantage racing into
upper stretch but gave out once headed by the winner. MINING CHROME pulled her way to the lead while angling to the rail leaving the chute, dictated the
pace under light rating to the far turn, then emptied out racing into the lane. LILY'S LEAD tracked the leaders inside a rival as part of the second flight racing
to the far turn and faded into the stretch. SWEET LAURA, reserved near the inside racing to the backstretch, offered no rally. VANDALIA tracked off the first
flight outside a rival from the outset to the far turn and came up empty racing into upper stretch.

Footnotes
NICK THE CARDSHARK was rated between foes just inside the first flight racing into the bend, angled to the rail entering upper stretch while being roused
to advance and wrested a narrow advantage in the closing stages under brisk right handed encouragement. KILLEEN was settled outside foes racing four
deep as part of the second flight in the opening stages, was prompted to advance while being fanned five wide in upper stretch but continued with a steady
bid while being just outkicked. CORT'N ASONG, urged from the outset disputing the pace in the three path, then just off the rail racing into the turn,
continued to dispute the issue between foes into the stretch but weakened between rivals nearing the wire. OLD TIMER'S DAY, in touch with the first flight
three deep racing in the five path on the backstretch, pressed the issue four wide on the turn to upper stretch while striking the front midstretch but failed to
sustain that momentum. PREPARE FOR GLORY tracked off the first flight three wide between foes racing into the turn, switched out widest to race six deep
in late stages but lacked the needed final response. BLAME BISHOP, urged between foes prompting the pace in the four path on the backstretch, shifted
inwards disputing the issue into the turn and gave out midstretch. CLIFFY tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the bend, saved ground
through the turn and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
FINERY, reserved inside rivals racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling nearing the far turn while dropping out last, saved ground through
the second bend gathering momentum, came around a tiring foe to bid for command inside foes leaving midstretch and went clear under firm
encouragement. ELECTORATE (IRE) angled inwards a bit to track just off the leaders outside a rival racing to the second bend, swung out to the four path
racing into upper stretch while being roused to challenge, moved to gain the advantage midstretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner.
LUNA ANTONIA, reserved between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, split foes three deep racing into upper stretch gaining position and
prevailed for a share at the wire. CORNICE TRAVERSE, pulled a bit against restraint while angling to the inside tracking just off the leaders, tipped out
racing into upper stretch while racing in some close quarters but lacked the needed final kick. WINGSPUN tracked off the second flight between foes racing
to the backstretch, raced in close quarters three deep nearing upper stretch, then shifted out five wide while continuing with interest to gain position to the
end. MISS SUGAR HILL (GB) tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening half, swung out four, then five wide racing into upper stretch and was
fanned six deep in late stages while failing to mount a rally. OJELEYE, urged disputing the pace outside a rival racing into the backstretch, dispatched that
foe nearing the lane, then dueled for command inside foes into upper stretch but gave out nearing the sixteenth marker. XCARET, off slowly, was caught
wide throughout while proving no threat. AVE FENIX, urged to the lead while angling to the rail disputing the pace leaving the chute, dueled for command
into the far turn and gave way abruptly racing into upper stretch.

SUZIE'SSTEPPINOUT was settled out of striking distance while angling nearer to the inside in the opening quarter, swung outside foes nearing upper
stretch to advance in the five path and responded to firm left handed pressure to reel in LADY JEAN nearing the wire. The latter ducked out at the start, was
rated outside foes while pulling a bit in the opening three sixteenths, made a sharp move nearing the half mile marker to press a rival's pace in the three
path racing into the turn, went clear on her own courage racing into upper stretch, was roused to extend the advantage but couldn't fend off the winner.
SHALL RETURN switched outside foes in early stages tracking the leaders in second flight, advanced on the pacesetter in the four path nearing upper
stretch but flattened out in late stages. BION MAGIC tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight to the turn, shifted off the inside nearing the lane but
had no closing bid. PROBABLY GRACE, prompted to a forward placing tracking just off the leaders between foes racing to the turn, steadily faded into
upper stretch. MISS LIANA, urged inside rivals to gain the lead in the opening furlongs, disputed the pace into the bend and gave way after a half. SHE
DAZZLE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
VIP NATION was rated along the inside, then between foes tracking the pacesetter from out of striking distance as part of the second flight in the opening
half, shifted out three wide racing into the far turn advancing on the leaders to challenge, took charge racing into upper stretch while shifting to the inside
and just held her rivals on a narrow margin to the end under firm handling. PUGILIST, bumped at the start, was reserved outside a rival in the last flight
racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance swinging out five wide nearing upper stretch, then continued with a steady bid to close the gap on the
winner while edging a rival for the place honors late. C'EST MARDI, reserved off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance
shifting three wide advancing between foes nearing upper stretch, then continued willingly between the top pair to close the gap on the winner while just
missing for second. GIVEITSOMEWELLIE, caught four wide racing into the first turn while being prompted to terms with rivals in the second flight, shifted
inwards on the backstretch while being urged to advance on the pacesetter nearing the second bend, gained terms with the leader to strike the front nearing
upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. TAKE ME AS I AM, urged to a forward placing along the rail leaving the chute, tracked the pacesetter inside
rivals to the far turn and steadily faded into the lane. MARIES MELODY broke inwards bumping PUGILIST, was urged to gain the advantage outside a rival
racing into the first turn, was urged well clear racing to the backstretch, set the pace into the second bend and gave out abruptly in upper stretch.
TIEBREAK, reserved near the inside racing to the backstretch, failed to mount a serious challenge. PLAY THAT TONE was a brief factor tracking the
pacesetter three deep between foes racing to the backstretch but retreated early.

Footnotes
MYSTIC LINK, urged to a forward placing stalking the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the first turn, steadily moved to terms with the leader after a half
attending the pace, pressed that rival racing through the far turn, was carried out a bit racing into upper stretch while gaining the advantage and edged clear
under firm encouragement. ALLEN tracked just off the second flight racing three wide into the backstretch, was urged to advance in that path between foes
on the far turn, couldn't match the winner's kick in the stretch but continued with interest to prevail for the place honors in the closing stages. DREAM
KEEPER sprinted to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin after a half to the second bend, shifted out
dueling for command inside the winner into upper stretch but yielded to that foe leaving the furlong marker. CORRADO was settled outside a rival in the last
flight in the opening three furlongs, was prompted to advance while caught four wide racing into the second bend, couldn't gain terms with the leaders, then
shifted inwards racing through the stretch while lacking a closing response. CURLIN'S THRILL settled into stride a bit off the inside racing to the
backstretch, was urged to advance between rivals racing into the far turn but lacked the needed closing bid. GUINESSEY was urged to a position along the
inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, came under pressure to advance entering the far turn but steadily faded into the stretch.
