Footnotes
INTO WISHING settled far off of the pace, gained five wide turning for home, and rallied outside of foes while on his left lead to wear down the leader in the
final sixteenth. NINEJUANJUAN CALL showed the way two wide, cleared into the turn, held sway well into the final furlong, but was nailed approaching the
wire. BOURBON SKY steadied early on, raced at the rear along the inside, came into the lane in the three path, then split foes two wide in upper stretch,
and gained show a sixteenth out. LS'SHOE'S IMAGE tracked three wide and between horses, failed to progress in the four path through upper stretch, but
stayed on to catch a tiring foe for a minor share late. IKNOWIDIDN'TDOTHAT stalked four to three wide, but faded entering the lane, then weakened
through the final sixteenth. NICE STAR raced at the rear two wide, swung to the six path entering the lane, and improved. BACK ALLEY JAMMIN possibly
bobbled at the start while last away, rushed between horses after a furlong to press the pace three to two wide and between horses into the turn, chased the
clear leader around the bend, but weakened in upper stretch. OURQUICKDRAWMCGRAW tossed his rider in the starting gate pre-race, then laid close up
along the inside for a quarter mile, but weakened at the seven sixteenths pole. CALLEN FEELS GOOD raced off of the pace four wide, but weakened
turning for home. NO HEAD-ON REPLAY AVAILABLE

Footnotes
ANGEL OF VERDUN stalked two wide, bid into the far turn, vied around that bend, then drew off in upper stretch, and was driven home to seal the deal.
MALIBU MOIRA settled far off of the pace two wide, trailed three wide around the far turn, then shifted from the six to the seven path in upper stretch, and
rallied outside of foes through the final furlong to reach place in the late stages. GOOD MONGOLIA tracked the pace in the three path, tipped to the four
path entering the lane, chased to bid for place among foes passing the furlong pole, but was outkicked in the final sixteenth. CHAMPAGNE HORIZON
saved ground off the pace, gained in upper stretch before tipping two wide approaching the furlong grounds, but flattened out. RANK AND FILE steadied
hard due to rider correction after being brushed by an inner foe at the start, trailed around the first turn, moved up four wide and outside of foes down the
backstretch, chased under urging around the far turn, drifted to the six path entering the lane, and leveled off. VARSITY FLYGIRL set the pace while
managing an uncontested lead to the half mile pole, but met ANGEL OF VERDUN's bid into the far turn, vied around that bend, but proved no match in
upper stretch, and weakened through the final furlong. GLANCE broke through the gate pre-race, but was re-loaded without further incident, laid off of the
pace in the three to two paths, attempted to split foes three wide in upper stretch, but lacked a further rally. TOTAL MALICE tracked along the inside from
the two path, came into the lane two wide, but weakened approaching the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
TRIVISTA tracked two wide and between horses, awaited racing room right behind the leaders turning for home, tipped to the four path at the quarter pole,
ranged up to bid outside of DICATATOR in midstretch, edged an advantage shortly after, and held. DICTATOR set the pace along the inside, led inside of a
vying REDOUX while a path off of the rail around the far turn, held an advantage through upper stretch, but was headed by TRIVISTA at the furlong
grounds, and fought on to the wire. LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS broke a bit outwardly at the start, tracked along the inside while saving ground, but lacked
enough racing room to slip inside of the leader in upper stretch, altered course outside of that foe passing the furlong grounds, and chased the leading pair
home while holding show. OFF SIXES prompted outside of the leader from the three path, but allowed an inner foe advance approaching the half mile pole,
chased from the four path around the far turn, but failed to keep pace at the quarter pole. REDOUX was restless awaiting the start, broke a step slowly,
stalked from the two path, moved to press the leader two wide approaching the half mile pole, vied around the far turn, but weakened between horses in
upper stretch. SKYCRAFT was allowed to settle at the rear two wide, failed to rally in the five to six path around the far turn, and played no factor. CONVICT
PIKE tracked from midpack three wide, but was strongly urged around the far turn, lacked a response, and made little impact. MOSTA FLYIN broke a step
slowly, and got outrun.

Footnotes
COUNTRY TIME set a comfortable pace in the two path, met EMPTY NET's challenge around the far turn, but dug in entering the lane, repelled that rival
approaching the furlong grounds, and drove clear. EMPTY NET prompted the leader from the outside and in the three path, bid around the far turn, but
failed to match strides entering midstretch, gave way through the final furlong, but lasted for place. CANDY'S PARADE laid off of the pace in the three to
four path, tipped to the five path entering the lane, and stayed on while hanging on his left lead to reach show at the sixteenth pole, but ran out of ground to
catch a tiring rival for place. EPHEMERAL stalked while tucking from the three path to the two path around the first turn, then saved ground while chasing
the top pair around the far turn, but faded in midstretch, and lost show a sixteenth out. MISS MAMBA laid off of the pace in the two to three paths, came into
the lane in the four path, but was outkicked by an outer rallying rival at the furlong grounds, then kept on. NIN TO WIN tracked along the inside, but was
restrained back from a bit of tight quarters at the six furlong pole, then lacked a rally. MARTYR OF CHARITY was pinched back between horses at the start,
and never got involved. MS SATCH MO tracked from the four path around the first turn, chased the leading pair from the three path around the far turn, then
weakened through the lane. SHE'S OUR STAR trailed by a distance throughout, and showed little.

Footnotes
GALAXY THIRTYSIX tracked from the three to four path, commenced a gain turning for home, rallied outside of rivals to take aim on a clear G'S SQUEEZE
entering the final sixteenth, surged to produce a late bid, and was bumped by that drifting rival approaching the wire, and forged an advantage on it. G'S
SQUEEZE vied three wide, led into the turn, inched clear at the quarter pole, but drifted outwardly in the final sixteenth as GALAXY THIRTYSIX closed in,
bumped that foe approaching the wire, and was nailed soon after. PLUM GOOD vied two wide and between horses, then only inside of G'S SQUEEZE
around the turn, but failed to match strides entering the lane, then fought on through the lane. SUZIE'S DREAM laid off of of the pace along the inside,
tipped two wide into the turn, then moved up between horses in upper stretch without threatening the leaders. SIENNA BREEZE stalked the leading trio
from the two to three path around the turn, inched closer turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer foe entering the lane, then flattened out shortly
after, and tired while hanging on her left lead. VIOLA STAR was off slowly while possibly breaking outwardly, then trailed the field four wide around the turn,
and improved entering the lane. ORETTA chased outside of the leading trio early on, but steadily faded through the turn. THE COMPLETE COURT vied for
the lead inside of a pair of rivals, but weakened approaching the three furlong pole. NO HEAD-ON REPLAY AVAILABLE.

Footnotes
PORT O' CALL set the pace, met a pair of outer bids at the seven-sixteenths pole, vied inside of BOULDERING around the far turn, then repelled that foe in
upper stretch, cleared, and held sway. BOULDERING stalked outside of the leader, bid into the far turn, vied before being repelled in upper stretch, and kept
on thereafter. PERRINS was sandwiched between horses at the start, saved ground at the rear of the field, took the far turn in the three path, then shifted in
passing the quarter pole, and rallied along the rail to claim show at the furlong grounds. CHARLIE G checked in tight quarters between horses in the three
path around the first turn, settled off of the pace, took the far turn in the four path, fanned to the eight path entering the lane, but steadied again when
maneuvering around OLE STUD MUFFIN entering the lane, then rallied on his left lead through the final furlong. JOEBOY stalked three wide, tucked to the
rail at the five furlong pole, claimed show from outer foes entering the lane, but hung on his left lead, and faltered in midstretch. GUITARTUITION PLZZ
settled far back while tucking from the five path to the two path around the first turn, trailed around the far turn, then moved up inside of foes in the lane.
ONEFORVIVI laid off of the pace in the three path, then between horses around the far turn, but tired in the lane. RONALDS GATSBY bumped with rivals
on both sides at the start, raced far of off the pace in the seven to five path around the first turn, then was floated from the five path to the nine path entering
the lane, and lacked a rally. CHIEF KIMOSABI tracked from midpack in the five to four path around the first turn, but lost position down the backstretch, and
failed to factor. OLE STUD MUFFIN broke outwardly and bothered multiple foes at the start, took the first turn in the six path while at the rear, but ran off
down the backstretch to bid for the lead at the seven sixteenths pole, stayed wide outside of a pair of foes around the far turn, then bore out turning for
home, and weakened. HARD KINGS tracked four wide, but weakened on his left lead through the lane. NORTHERNREFLECTION took a bump from an
inner rival at the start causing his rider to lose his irons, trailed before being pulled up around the far turn, then walked off.

CITIZEN WEST broke through the gate pre-race, vied for the lead two wide, led turning for home, drove clear in upper stretch, dug into resist ABUELO
NUNO's bid at the furlong grounds, dueled through the final furlong, and gamely prevailed. ABUELO NUNO stalked the leading pair from the inside, tipped
outside of them at the five sixteenths pole, chased a clear CITIZEN WEST in upper stretch before bidding at the furlong grounds to spark a duel, battled with
that rival through the late stages, but was denied. GEMO RAIN hopped at the start, tracked from midpack in the two path, altered to the five path at the three
sixteenths pole, and claimed show at the furlong grounds. TWIRLING ROSES laid off of the pace in the three path, swung to the five path entering the lane,
and stayed on mildly while hanging on his left lead. AMERICAN UNION broke a step slowly, took the turn in the two path while far off of the pace, and made
little impact. LT. JUNIOR GRADE was reluctant to load, pressed the pace three wide, but weakened while getting floated four wide at the five sixteenths
pole. DESOTO'S WAR broke through the gate, vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but failed to keep pace turning for home, and weakened in

Footnotes
BIG AGENDA tracked from the four path, inched closer to press the leading trio into the far turn, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, kept on through
the final furlong, re-bid outside of the tiring leading approaching the wire, and got up on it. FOREVER MO pressed two wide, vied between horses into the
far turn, dug in entering the lane to sustain a duel inside of FIREWATER JAKE, prevailed in that battle a sixteenth out, inched clear, but tired shortly after,
and got nailed by an outer rival while saving place. NEW EAGLE stalked along the inside from the two path, got outmoved by outer bidders into the far turn,
tracked intently around that bend, tipped three wide and outside of the leading duelers at the three sixteenths pole, switched to his right lead shortly after,
grinded away inside of BIG AGENDA through the final furlong, but was brushed by a yielding FIREWATER JAKE entering the final sixteenth, flopped back
to his left lead in the process, sustained his advance to attempt a bid between horses on the wire, but was outfinished while missing place. FIREWATER
JAKE broke inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, stalked the pace from the three path, bid three wide and between horses into the far turn, led passing
the three furlong pole, battled with an inner FOREVER MO entering the lane as that foe dug in, dueled through midstretch, but yielded approaching the final
sixteenth, and brushed NEW EAGLE at that marker. JUST GUN IT broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside while
a path off of the rail, then chased the leading group through the lane, but failed to menace. WAR CHEST was severely pinched between horses and
steadied at the start, raced at the rear along the inside, and never got involved. GRAND ATLANTIC set the pace along the inside, met a trio of bids into the
far turn, sustained a chase around that bend, but faded in upper stretch. HAY DAKOTA broke inwardly, and was outrun.

Footnotes
CHARLIE'S PEAK cleared at the half mile pole, set the pace inside of a pressing MO BELLA around the turn, drew off at the quarter pole, and lasted to the
wire. STOP SHOP N DROP broke slowly, laid off of the pace in the two path around the turn, split foes three wide approaching the final furlong, then rallied
through the late stages, but ran out of ground to reel in the leader. CUSTOM GUITAR tracked the pace three wide, drifted to the four path at the quarter
pole, chased the clear leader through the lane, but was outkicked by an inner foe for place passing the furlong pole. T R'S FIRST raced far back in the four
path around the turn, and stayed on to split rivals for a minor share in the final furong. PAT HAND GIRL hopped slightly at the start, raced far back in the five
to six path, and moved up outside of rivals. WHEELS LIKE NALA tracked along the inside, chased through upper stretch, but faded thereafter. BODE'S
CONNECTION laid off of the pace in the four path, floated to the five path entering the lane, and weakened. MO BELLA stalked two wide, but weakened
entering the lane. WHIMSICAL LADY was outrun. MISS CARUSO saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail.
