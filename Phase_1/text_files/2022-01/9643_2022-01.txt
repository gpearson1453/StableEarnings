Footnotes
WORKIN NINETOFIVE came in and bumped at the start, advanced to the turn, assumed command and drew off in the drive under urging. LIP'S OF WINE
bobbled at the start, advanced between horses on the turn, closed inside, couldn't gain in the winner and finished second best. SWEET LADY LANA was
never far off the pace, went six wide at the top of the stretch and offered a mild bid to be along for show. MALIBUENA was hustled along to set the pace to
the turn, faltered and faded through the stretch. SHEZA HOME HIT came in and was steadied at the start, lagged early, dropped inside and lacked a bid.
ARIZONA BREW broke slowly and was crowded at the start, moved up to stalk the pace and gave way on the turn. PARTY POLICE raced inside, showed
speed to the turn and stopped. MUCH ABOUT ONE was not a factor. WICKED WEAVE was bumped and crowded at the start, raced in the back, had the
rider llose the whip on the turn, lacked a bid and was outrun.

FIRE WHEN READY bumped and was squeezed start. RIDEO raced three across along the backstretch, inched clear on the turn, dueled through the
stretch and yielded grudgingly. MR. PICKLES was unhurried early, saved ground, bid along the inside to get within range, came up empty late and settled
for show. TIGER BY HIS TAIL broke in and bumped at the start, raced between horses on the backstretch and tired on the turn. PROVOST led around the
first turn, showed speed to the second turn, tired and stopped.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT GARDEN went four wide on the first turn, challenged between horses on the second turn, dueled for the lead and drew clear late to prove best.
BIG STRETCH was never far back, rallied around the turn, closed steadily and got up at the wire for second. LA CASTIGLIONE was justled at the start, set
the pace, was headed on the turn, continued gamely to contend, didn't have enough late and was caught for place. SPUN LINE bobbled at the start, raced
close to the pace inside, angled out on the turn, assumed command, inched away and faltered late to lose position. PIPER ROSE was jostled at the start,
raced evenly and faiiled to menace. SHOE GAME pressed the pace while racing between horses to the second turn, fell back and faded. PAIGE RUNNER
was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
JEDI WARRIOR was unhurried early, advanced to the turn, went seven wide at the top of the stretch, closed under steady urging and drew off.]. AUTISM
SIBLINGS was never far back, bid six wide between horses in the upper stretch, couldn't gain on the winner and finished second best. SWAGSATIONAL
altered course in the upper stretch, closed once clear and got up for show. SUNLAND STAR got away well, raced inside, bid between horses to threaten
and came up empty late. IMPERATOR raced mid pack, bid and came up empty. TWILIGHT RIDER raced in the back, went eight wide at the top of the
stretch and lacked a bid. FORT YORK broke slowly and was checked at the start, was taken outside and failed to threaten. TALKIN MALICE settled off the
pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, led briefly and stopped. THEY'RE GRRREAT sprinted clear to set the pace to the second turn, tired and gave
way.
