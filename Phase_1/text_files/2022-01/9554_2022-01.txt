Footnotes
GOLDENPENCE chased inside leader to turn angled out into the stretch and hustled clear while ridden out to the wire. HARD NIGHT inside run to turn,
steadied slightly into the turn, ran on for place but proved no match for the winner. UNDER THE COUVERS quick to the front, led to deep stretch, gave in
readily late. FRANCO'S TEAM raced evenly with no response when needed. DEEP MIND raced outside close up to the turn, leveled off in the stretch. RAF
raced a wide trip with no gain when called upon. DEVILISH TAIL slow into stride from the gate, could not keep up, no menace. SIR NUISANCE outpaced
from the gate and never menaced.

ERASE speed to front while well rationed throughout, stayed clear to wire under steady handling. TWENTY FOUR MAMBA in tight first turn briefly, secured
good position while never far back thereafter, rallied far turn with a bid and stayed on in the stretch run for place spot while no match late. RICH STRIKE no
speed to far turn, rallied along late for show spot proving best of the rest. O P FIRECRACKER never far back to far turn, raced evenly from far turn to wire.
AMICABLE never a real menace. WISH ME HOME perfect position wide to the half, nothing left and dropped back. ZOOMBIE pressured winner from
between horses to far turn but faded back from that point. FRIAR LAURENCE wide run first turn, tried hard to keep up but faded back turn. CHISMOSO
caught in tight and checked back hard around the first turn, lost best chance. AIN'T STRAIGHT raced widest into first turn, tried to keep up but was through
