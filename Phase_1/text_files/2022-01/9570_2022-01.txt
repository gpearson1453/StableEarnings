Footnotes
CIRCLE WEST broke sharply to duel for the early advantage with WARFRONT FIGHTER from the inside, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and
drew off through the closing yards. WARFRONT FIGHTER pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong.
WINNING MAGIC lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. ROADSIDE settled off the leaders early, saved
ground through the turn and failed to rally. RANCHER hopped at the start, raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually
weakened. DEPUTY KNIGHT lagged, raced five-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
NEXT JOURNEY checked at the start, settled off the leaders from between foes, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew
off. MINNESOTA RED raced off the pacesetters early, saved ground through the second turn, lacked racing room approaching the stretch, angled out,
moved between rivals in mid-stretch and finished with good energy. SHADYFIED was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn and
finished with a belated bid. PRETTY LOUD lagged early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished with a belated bid. RESULTANT was
forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and gave way in the drive. BLAME THE DEVIL was away in good order to press the pace
of STORMY SUMMIT while racing three-wide and weakened after going five furlongs. STORMY SUMMIT broke sharply to dispute the pace from the inside
and weakened through the final furlong. TRAPALIS was forwardly placed from the inside and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
MISAWA dueled for the lead with THEONETOBEAT while racing three-wide, opened a clear lead with a sixteenth to run and drew off through the final
yards. THEONETOBEAT disputed the pace with the winner from the inside, could not match strides with that rival in the drive but finished well to hold the
place. INDIAN NIGHTS was forwardly placed early, raced five-wide through the turn and failed to gain late. FLYING CHARLIE settled off the leaders early,
moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. CHIEF GOVERNOR was off slow, showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the
turn and was not a factor. LIGHTNING STAR was void of early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. E. Z. PAPA raced off the
pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and weakened.

willingly. MARCH ON LINCH tracked the leaders from the inside and failed to gain in the drive. SPEEDING STYLE was forwardly placed early, raced
three-wide through the turn and finished evenly. HERZEN was never far back, raced four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. A
GEM IS A GEM was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and lacked the needed rally. BREXTON lacked early foot, raced three-wide through
the turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
THIRTYMINUTEMASS pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to engage ROUSING RUBBLE nearing the three-sixteenths marker, vied with
that rival and gamely held. ROUSING RUBBLE dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by the winner into the stretch, vied
and gave way grudgingly. EXPRESS PERMISSION disputed the pace from the inside throughout and gave way late. COLAVITO was forwardly placed
early, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. TOP ROCKET was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn
and finished evenly. STANLEY RYDER settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. PREMIER LEAGUE lacked early
foot, saved ground throughout and did not threaten. FISHEL showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. EMPIRE
WICKET was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace. ACTIVE PASS lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the turn
and did not offer a bid. FABULOUS FLOYD chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened. PLANET NINE raced off the pacesetters early, moved
six-wide through the turn and weakened.
