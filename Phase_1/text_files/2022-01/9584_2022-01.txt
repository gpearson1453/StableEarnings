Footnotes
EL SAMURO was urged inside a rival prompting the pace racing to the backstretch, steadily pressed the issue racing inside foes into the far turn, came
through racing into upper stretch and went clear late under firm left handed pressure. CURLIN'S THRILL, urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail, dictated
the pace between foes on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, pressed the issue outside the eventual winner to upper stretch but proved no match
late. LAST PROMISE broke in the air while getting away well behind the field, was prompted to a position tracking off the leaders while switching off the
inside racing to the backstretch, was urged to lodge a three wide bid nearing the far turn but came up empty racing into the lane. SOBERANO (FR) tracked
the leaders outside a rival racing three wide, then four wide into the backstretch and faded after a half. JO JO KATZ was settled last early and failed to
menace. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
MURUMBI angled to the inside tracking the leaders through the backstretch into the bend, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and rallied to a
clear advantage in time under firm handling. TAHAWEEL, reserved between foes in the opening stages, split rivals, then advanced on the leaders three
wide racing into the turn to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, gained a narrow advantage in late stages but couldn't fend off the winner. CALL
TONY tracked just off the pacesetter between foes in the opening stages, advanced to press the issue racing into the turn dueling between foes, then
weakened inside the top pair leaving midstretch. LADY WOOD, reserved off the second flight along the inside on the backstretch, shifted off the inside
leaving the midway point of the turn but had no closing bid. READY TO RUMBLE, urged to gain the lead while angling to the inside racing into the
backstretch, dueled for command inside foes into the turn and gave way. MISS ENCISO, reserved outside foes in the opening stages, raced five deep to the
turn and steadily faded racing into upper stretch. MAARTY'S DILEMMA, forwardly placed four wide tracking just off the pacesetter outside rivals, gave way
between foes racing into the turn.

Footnotes
ROYAL ROCKER broke readily to gain a forward placing, stalked just outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue entering the far
turn, took over nearing upper stretch while being floated to the three path but went clear under firm handling. MAGIC SURPRISE hopped at the start, settled
last while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn advancing along the rail with interest to midstretch but lacked the
needed final kick. TIZNOWMORNING tracked the leaders inside a rival from just out of striking distance to the backstretch, tipped out racing through the far
turn while under prompting to advance but had no closing bid. RUSTON DRILL, urged to the lead along the inside racing to the backstretch, dictated the
pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled inside the eventual winner while shifting a bit off the inside nearing the lane and gave way into upper stretch.
RACHEL DREAM tracked the leaders outside foes to the backstretch and gave way after a half.

NETTE NETTE was urged between foes pressing the pace racing through the backstretch to strike the front racing past the half mile marker, continued to
dispute the issue while being headed racing through the turn but edged forward determinedly while shifting to the inside regaining the advantage under
strong encouragement to go clear in upper stretch, then extended her margin through the closing stages and was taken in hand in hand approaching the
wire. CANDY JAR was rated off the leaders three wide between racing through the backstretch, was prompted to advance splitting rivals just off the inside
racing into upper stretch and narrowly prevailed for the place honors on the wire. VENUS OYZO was rated off the first flight four wide between foes on the
backstretch, shifted back to that path racing into upper stretch while being urged to advance and continued with interest while being just outkicked for
second. EXPECT TO BE READY, urged forcing the pace three wide on a narrow advantage between calls on the backstretch, pressed the issue outside the
eventual winner to strike the front racing through the turn, couldn't match terms with the winner entering the lane and soon gave way. JOYOUS FAIRY
TALE, urged inside foes prompting the pace racing into the bend, couldn't keep terms with the leaders entering the bend and gave way nearing the lane.
DIALING VALENTINE broke slowly and never gained contention. LA MAGNOLIA raced five wide under light rating on the backstretch and dropped back
early.

Footnotes
ONWARD AUSTIN broke readily, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a clear margin racing to the first turn, held sway under prompting to maintain
that margin to the far turn, then responded to firm left handed pressure to remain clear racing nearest the rail to the wire. VENEZUELAN TRIUMPH was
rated three deep between foes tracking the pacesetter from just of striking distance in the opening half, shifted inwards while being prompted to advance on
the far turn, then continued with a steady bid in pursuit of the winner into the stretch while proving only second best. BARBERINI was firmly rated racing four
wide to the backstretch, continued three deep through the far turn to upper stretch to while making some mild progress in the closing stages. FIERCE
WARRIOR, off slowly, then carried inwards just after the start, was settled last to the backstretch, switched outside foes racing into upper stretch but made
no real impression. MELINA'S DREAM was rated inside rivals tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight in the opening half, came under pressure
nearing the far turn but quickly came up empty. SKIPPERINI broke inwards crossing the path of FIERCE WARRIOR, was quickly righted, then was rated
between foes tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight to the backstretch, shifted to the inside nearing the far turn and soon faded.

Footnotes
TAMI'S ORCHID angled to the rail in early stages while under light rating tracking behind the second flight to the backstretch, was prompted to advance
inside foes after a half steadily closing the gap on the pacesetter, tipped outside that foe entering the far turn while moving to terms, contested the issue in a
prolonged drive past midstretch but edged clear late under firm right handed encouragement. TWELVE RED ROSES, urged disputing the pace inside a rival
a bit off the inside racing to the first turn, shook clear after a half while angling to the inside, set the pace into the second bend, resisted the winner's
challengers through the far turn to midstretch but proved only second best. VARSITY KICKLINE (IRE), a step slow into stride, gradually gained position
inside foes nearing the far turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, then came through inside foes to gain position to the end while earning a
share. BLUE KENTUCKY GIRL angled inwards tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, continued along the inside to the far turn, shifted out
racing into upper stretch but had no closing bid. FAST FASHION tracked just off the leaders three deep, then four wide into the backstretch, continued
outside a rival tracking the leaders into the second bend, was fanned to the four path in upper stretch and steadily faded. BOB'S LADY, caught four wide
while being prompted to contention racing into the first turn, tracked off the second flight into the backstretch and dropped back early. SYLLABUS angled
inwards while being urged to press the pace outside a rival racing into the first turn and gave way after a half. KITTENS MISS MOJO was off slowly and
never gained contention. EMMA LIVE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CODETOWIN broke readily, shifted inwards to attend a rival's pace under light rating racing through the backstretch, was prompted to press the issue
racing between foes into the turn, shifted to the three path in upper stretch and readily kicked away to go well clear under right handed encouragement.
DOODLE HOPPER tracked just off the first flight outside rivals racing through the backstretch, was urged to advance to terms with the leaders three wide
racing into the bend, couldn't match the winner in the drive but proved best of the others. GEMO angled to the inside stalking just off the pacesetter under
light rating in the opening stages, came through inside foes when presented an opening racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. HOT AND
HEAVY was urged dictating the pace on a narrow advantage along the inside in the opening stages, dueled for command inside rivals racing into the turn,
shifted out racing into upper stretch and soon gave way. POLLOCK was switched off the inside in early staged to track just off the second flight between
foes but faded racing into the bend. PRICING EXERCISE shifted out four wide early tracking just off the second flight but steadily retreated racing into the
turn.

Footnotes
LUNA QUEEN broke readily, sped clear of the field while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a comfortable advantage to the
second bend and held HELLO ROSIE SAY safe to the end under firm handling. The latter angled to the inside racing to the first turn tracking the pacesetter
from just out of striking distance, was prompted to advance inside a rival nearing the lane, tipped out racing through the stretch while being roused to
advance and continued willingly to close the gap while proving only second best. JUST STAY HOME, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter to the
first turn, conceded some ground to that foe on the backstretch, was prompted to advance nearing upper stretch but weakened in late stages while just
lasting for a share. WORKING OVERTIME tracked the leaders three wide to the far turn while coming under pressure to advance, shifted inside entering the
stretch but lacked the needed final kick. NOT ORBINARY settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch, swung out nearing upper stretch
but offered no rally. SAYOH angled to the inside early tracking off the second flight to the far turn but came up empty nearing the lane.
