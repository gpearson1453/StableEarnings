STONE TOP was away alertly to duel for the lead from the inside with CHARMANT E, checked nearing the quarter and edged away in the drive.
CHARMANT E broke sharply to duel for the lead with the winner while racing three-wide from between foes, vied with that foe into deep stretch but could
not match strides late. THRILL'S LEGACY settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached a striking position and finished evenly
late. TOTHEMOONANDBACK disputed the pace while racing four-wide and gave way after a half. PALACE STAR lagged early, moved five-wide through
the turn and did not offer a bid.

CAMINO DE ESTRELLA was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and quickly drew
off. ARABIAN STORY was away in good order to duel for the lead with MR NAVIGATOR while racing three-wide and gave way to the winner late. TAKE
CHARGE DEPUTY showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. FANTASTIC DAY lacked early speed, saved
ground through the turn, offered a bid in mid-stretch and failed to sustain his rally. MARK YE WELL chased the leaders while racing five-wide and weakened
after going a half. MR NAVIGATOR bobbled at the break, disputed the pace from the inside for five furlongs and weakened.

Footnotes
FLYING TO THE LINE set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin into the lane and held off the closing HURRICAIN HUNTER to prevail.
HURRICAIN HUNTER showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn, could not reach the winner in the drive but was clearly second best.
LADY LANA was void of early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished willingly. CHEWY CHEWY GOOD
settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, bumped with KID CAT into the stretch and finished evenly. MS SALLY lacked early
foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and failed to menace. DANCE SHOES pressed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way through the
final furlong. SMOOTH RITHMS was forwardly placed early from between foes, moved four-wide through the second turn, bumped with CHEWY CHEWY
GOOD nearing the three-sixteenths pole and weakened in the drive. TRIBAL BID chased the leaders from the inside and weakened through the final
furlong. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
BIG ANDY chased the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and was up late. JEWEL AZUL lacked early foot, saved ground through the
second turn and finished with good energy. B J'S SPIRIT pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter and gave
way in the drive. RED VENUS was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. CURIOUS INJI showed no early speed,
raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace. FORTHELOVEOFLYDIA was away in good order to chase the leaders from the inside and
weakened through the final furlong. KARALINKA was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and weakened. STREET SHADOW
raced five-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders, weakened and was eased late. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
