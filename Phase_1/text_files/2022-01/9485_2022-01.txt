Footnotes
MY TIGRESS off slow and away last, rushed up in between rivals and miraculously found rail still open approaching the five sixteenths, took command into
the turn, shook clear at top of the stretch and held on while tiring late. SOME ROYALTY away well and chose to stay four wide on the backstretch,
continued wide journey on the turn, entered stretch three wide and gained on leader to the wire while getting up for second. MY SIS CINDY vied between
rivals on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered stretch in range of leader and gained on leader while being outnodded for second. AT
THE MARGIN bumped by rival at the start, saved ground at the rear of the field on the backstretch, continued to trail on the turn and made good late
progress to finish up willingly in between rivals. MY BELLA CHICK bumped with inside rival shortly after the break, found a stalking position along the rail on
the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, in range for show money in the stretch but faded inside the final sixteenth. BALLET ROYALTY saved
ground throughout and failed to launch a good enough rally under urging. SWEETENER appeared hard to ride and lugged in causing rider to take up for
precautionary reasons, lugged in a path on the turn and entered stretch four wide and failed to make any meaningful progress. EXCESS COIL pressed pace
three wide on the backstretch, entered turn vying for lead three wide and began to fade early on in the turn and coasted home.
