SCOOBY ROO was antsy in the gate prior to the start, rushed up outside to make the lead before a quarter then widened through the stretch to win as
much the best while taken in hand late. SWEET EMPIRE never far back, brushed with YOU NAME IT in upper stretch and got up for second inside rivals.
YOU NAME IT close up, was brushed at the top of the stretch and finished with good courage two wide. MARGARITA CINCO pressed the pace down the
backstretch and was outfinished four wide. INDELIBLE IMAGE lead briefly, chased the pace into the stretch then faded three wide. AUGMENTING ASSETS
trailed. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
UNYIELDING never far back, got through along the rail through the turn, made the lead at the top of the stretch and finished full of run under a strong hand
ride to win going away. SILENT TIGER pressed the pace two wide and finished well clear for second. SELLING OUT trailed into the stretch then passed
tiring rivals. GIVIN UP NONE was bumped at the start, prompted the pace three wide into the stretch then faded. UNCLE MOMO broke outward bumping
GIVIN UP NONE, raced outside and lacked the needed response. WHERE YA GOIN OWEN was no factor. SOUTHERN SPIRIT away alertly, set the pace
along the inside to the top of the stretch, drifted out then stopped.

STORM RISK broke in front, set all the pace, turned back a bid from SMASH in upper stretch and shook clear late to win in hand. SMASH never far back,
loomed boldly along the rail into the stretch then hung. SHELL FIRE with the second flight two wide, went evenly four wide through the stretch. NOD TO
PERSIA allowed to settle, moved closer along the inside into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. KOSCIUSZKO pressured the winner from the five
path through the far turn then gave way. ENJOY BASEBALL passed tiring rivals. GILES had his heels clipped entering the clubhouse turn and was no
threat. DOUBLE DEEP clipped heels entering the clubhouse turn and was no factor. BARITONE was outrun.

PLAY BALL away alertly, dueled for the early lead along the inside, shook clear on the turn, set the balance of the pace and won under strong handling.
OVER ICCE trailed for a half, rallied three wide into the stretch and finished clear for second. MISTER MOBIL well placed, went evenly inside. PRIVATE
DRIVE pressed the early pace three wide and faded in the stretch. ROSCO P. COLTRANE offered a mild bid three wide into the stretch then came up
empty. CLASSIC MO battled with the winner two wide into the turn, had speed into the stretch then tired.

Footnotes
O'HAIRE stalked the early pace, went up to contest the lead three then two wide before a half, battled through the far turn and the length of the stretch and
proved best in a game effort. SEMI CHARMED DAY prompted the pace two wide around the clubhouse turn, made the lead before a half, was headed by
the winner nearing the far turn, regained command, battled the length of the stretch and just failed. SKYLIME was hustled to the lead soon after the start, set
the pace for a quarter, stalked the pace the balance of the trip and finished determinedly in the four path. DRAMATIC KITTEN settled along the inside,
swung out to the six path and rallied belatedly. SUGAR DOG FOX passed tiring rivals inside. MUSICAL MAN moved up four wide before a half, had speed
into the stretch then came up empty. LAS ANA close up, was through after a half. GOOSE DOWN GREY was outrun. DOM CAETANO (ARG) trailed.

THIS MAN CAN made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace, widened into the stretch and won under strong handling. CHIEF BIG HEAD unhurried
inside, shifted out to the five path past the quarter pole, rallied determinedly and got up for second. CAPTAIN RILEY trailed early and finished with good
courage along the rail. THE MAN CAN pressured the winner early, chased that one from the three path into the stretch then faded. GRAD BASH failed to
menace. ATTACK ANGLE was no factor. BUCKITITLEWAVE stalked the pace two wide into the stretch then gave way. OLE WATASHI had speed three
wide into the turn then flattened out.

Footnotes
BOATSWAIN pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, made the lead then widened the balance of the trip under right handed urging to win going away.
HENNESSY FIRE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, shifted to the five path in mid stretch and got up for second. TWO STEP SLEW broke in
front, set the pace along the inside into the stretch then was outfinished. FLEET RUN failed to menace. MR. CAT stalked the pace along the inside into the
stretch then faded. CANTANKEROUS BOBBY had brief speed. PLEA BARGAIN was outrun and returned bleeding from the nostrils. FOOLISH EQUATION
trailed.
