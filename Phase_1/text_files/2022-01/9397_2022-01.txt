Footnotes
BOLD ARTICLE was hustled leaving the break, floated out INDIAN DANCER and DESERT SMOKE in the run into the first turn, pressed the pace while
rating nicely through the backstretch run, collared the pacesetter nearing the furlong marker and kicked clear in the end. INDIAN DANCER was floated three
wide entering the first turn and stalked the pace outside of foes through the backstretch run, was three wide on the second turn and was outkicked in the
drive, while just holding on for second over a rallying rival. ESCAPE THE CITY (GB) was allowed to settle through the early stages, was four wide on the
second turn, angled out and rallied in the stretch and just missed for second while holding for third. PROOF OF JAZZ was away in good order and set
pressured fractions through the second turn, was confronted by the winner leaving the turn and battled back a bit but yielded inside of the furlong marker
and was empty in the late going. DESERT SMOKE was floated four to five wide entering the first turn, sat off of the pace while outside of foes through the
backstretch run, was three wide between rivals on the second turn and lacked a final bid in the stretch. STAND IN YOUR LOVE saved ground throughout
while stalking the pace and weakened in the stretch run. LIZZY'S INTHEGAME was away a bit slowly and was unhurried through the early going, was two
wide on the second turn and lacked a late rally.

Footnotes
ANTHONYS CLEOPATRA was away well and was sent to set the quick pace from a two wide path, shook free of a pressing rival leaving the turn and
opened the lead, was a bit green and erratic in the lane but was kept to task and won in a drive in a good debut. MUSIC FESTIVAL stalked the quick pace
from the inside, was set down for the drive and was able to close a bit on the winner in the final furlong but could not reel him in while well clear of the rest.
CIELO DIAMANTE chased the pace outside of foes from the second flight, gained ground on the turn while five wide but could not go on with that run in the
stretch but did hold for the show. THREE DIMENSIONAL chased the pace outside of foes, was five wide on the turn and tired in the drive. DON'T TELL
HYDEE pressed the quick pace through the turn and gave way in the stretch run. AYELLOWROSEOFTEXAS chased the early pace into the turn, lost
ground on the turn while three wide and weakened in the late stages. FILLY PELLI was a bit slow into stride and chased the pace from the rear, saved
ground through the turn while near the rear and lacked a late response in the stretch.

Footnotes
GALLANT WARREN settled in the second flight outside of foes, improved position on the second turn while four wide, continued that run under firm
encouragement and surged in the final stages to prevail. OF GOOD REPORT tracked the pace outside of foes through the second turn, mounted a three
wide bid nearing the quarter-marker, took over from the tiring pacesetter and led into the final sixteenth but could not hold off the quickly oncoming winner.
UNION LEADER was allowed to settled through the backstretch run while saving ground, was asked for run nearing the quarter-marker and closed well
inside of foes in the stretch to claim the show. LOAFERS BOY settled toward the rear in the early going, gained ground while five wide on the second turn
and was outkicked in the stretch drive. PUSH THROUGH stalked the pace from the second flight inside of rivals and lacked a late rally in the stretch run.
SYNTHESIS pressed the pace through the second turn and gave way in the late stages. RIVER ROSE was away in good order and set pressured fractions
through the second turn, was overtaken nearing the furlong marker and weakened in the drive. ENGRAM was forwardly placed while stalking the pace from
the inside through the turn, checked in tight quarters leaving the three-eighths marker, quickly dropped back and was empty for the stretch run.

Footnotes
LAGATHA stalked the pace while in hand outside of rivals, mounted a two wide bid to confront the tiring pacesetter nearing the furlong marker, took the lead
and drew clear in the end. THE GREAT HAYNES chased the pace outside of foes while three wide, came within aim nearing the furlong marker and was
outfinished in the late going. STYLEDOME (IRE) tracked the pace outside of rivals, gained ground approaching the quarter-marker and was outkicked in the
drive, while holding for third. SWANEE showed good speed while setting a moderately quick pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter-marker and
weakened in the stretch run. CHIEFTAIN'S LADY tracked the pace outside of foes through the turn and tired in the stretch drive. J AND K EXPRESS was
sent leaving the break, conceded the lead heading into the turn, lost ground approaching the top of the lane and faded in the late stages. KITTY'S CANDY
was away a bit slowly and showed no early speed, while saving ground and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MI AMARE tracked the early pace while saving ground, mounted an inside bid leaving the turn to confront JAYS ANGEL, battled with that foe and dug in in
the final stages to prevail. JAYS ANGEL broke alertly and was sent to set pressured fractions through the turn while two wide, was confronted by MI
AMARE nearing the furlong marker, battled with that rival through the lane and was bested in the end, while clear of the rest. ROCK N ROLL SONG saved
ground while stalking the pace toward the rear, improved position along the turn, was in tight nearing the furlong grounds and was outkicked by the top two
in deep stretch. BALI BRAVA traded bumps with DIZZY LIZZY leaving the break and was away a bit slowly, stalked the pace outside of rivals, gained
ground while five wide leaving the turn but flattened out in that effort in the stretch run. JAYCEE pressed the pace outside of rivals into the turn, lost ground
nearing the top of the stretch and weakened in the drive. ROUSING YOU BABE chased the pace from a three wide position into the turn, lost ground on the
turn and gave way in the stretch run. SCREAMIN EMERY pressed the pace between foes into the turn, kept up that pressure along the turn, gave a bit of
ground leaving the turn, was giving way when pinched in tight quarters in deep stretch and had no late response. LADY OF FAITH was forwardly placed in
the early going, tracked the pace while three wide on the turn and gave way in the stretch run. DANCING TILL DAWN had no speed in the early stages, was
two wide on the turn and was not a factor. DRAPER STREET chased the pace from the second flight while two wide and tired in the drive. DIZZY LIZZY
exchanged bumps with BALI BRAVA leaving the starting gate, tracked the pace from the midflight into the turn, lugged out on the turn and was not asked for
run in the late going.
