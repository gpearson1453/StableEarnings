lane,

UCANTMAKETHISTUFUP with the early pace inside, garnered a larger lead while remaining closest to the rail out of the turn, could not match strides with
the winner the final furlong, remained clear for the second spot. HACKER unseated his rider and ran off for a quarter prior to the start, loaded in good order,
broke with the leaders, four wide when forwardly placed into the turn, three wide when vying late in the turn, could not keep up with the top two through the
stretch, remained well clear of the others. BACKGATE RED behind the early pace toward the inside, continued to save ground through the turn, angled out
steadily in upper stretch and finished up evenly while not a threat to the top three. BUMPER POOL lacked speed outside, came five wide into the stretch,
also went one paced through the stretch in lacking a closing response. BOTANY just off the inside when off the pace, raced in the two path through the turn,
improved position a bit while not posing a serious threat. MOONSHINE VISION void of speed while racing outside, five out to six wide through the turn,
passed some foes in upper stretch, evenly late. ACCEL JOE lacked speed while racing off the inside, three wide into the turn, dropped to the rail for the
drive, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while a non factor. MO HAWK MAN broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch off the inside, vied between
horses through much of the turn then gave way in the drive. NORTHERN WOODS off slowly to spot the field a couple of lengths, moved outside for the turn,
never a threat. JUSTDENNIS mid pack early, steady fade. PREACHER'S PET flashed brief speed between horses and stopped.

Footnotes
BEBOP SHOES broke alertly, soon sprinted clear, all the pace, got out to be three wide into the stretch, maintained daylight through the stretch under
steady handling. SECRETARY AT WAR broke back, moved up to race in mid pack outside early, floated out to be five wide into the lane, remained widest
through the stretch, slowly getting to the winner late while still well out in the strip. CABOT broke out, was straightened to chase the winner in the three path,
remained closest to that rival a furlong outside, outkicked for the place late. CHICORY BLUE fell back after the start, two path into the turn, angled out to be
four wide entering the stretch, improved position down the lane. LEO DEL REO raced in mid pack while racing off the inside, lacked a closing response
when set down for the drive. MIAS MOONBEAM off a step slow, trailed well back in the run up the backstretch, displayed a modest amount of late interest
to improve position while not posing a serious threat. FORT RIDGE forwardly placed early outside, four wide through the turn, weakened in the drive. MINE
MY TIME saved ground to no avail. DARK NINJA failed to menace while racing outside. COLONEL TALBOT fell back, three wide turn, continued to be
outrun through the lane. PULL MY CHAIN forwardly placed early, gave way through the turn, far back.

Footnotes
PURE ROCKET lacked speed, moved closer in some traffic off the inside into the far turn, steadied, quickly recovered and steered out four wide turning for
home, challenged soon after and quickly drove well clear. CHEROKEE LEGACY in the second flight while racing outside, four wide onto the backstretch,
remained outside and was four wide into the far turn, came three wide into the lane, proved no match for the winner, clearly second best. CLANCY'S
PISTOL void of speed, steered out four wide turning into the stretch, had little for the top two in the run to the wire while drifting a bit through the stretch,
clear of the others. TEQUILA REVOLUTION settled in mid pack early while three wide, continued in the three path through the second bend, went evenly
through the stretch. LOOKINFOREXCITEMEN forwardly placed into and through the first turn, saved ground through the second bend with still within
striking distance, had no punch when set down for the drive. NO HUDDLE hesitated at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, raced well back for five
furlongs, three wide when improving through the stretch, flattened out in the drive. GLASSATO closest to the early leader just off the inside, advanced and
took over after a half, weakened when headed by the winner into the lane. LOOKIN GOOD SO FAR unruly in the post parade, sprinted clear after breaking
on top, set the pace for just under a half then began to gradually weaken when headed at the halfway point. WESLEYAN four wide through the first turn
when off the pace, continued four wide through the second bend when moving a bit closer, began to tire when bothered a bit turning for home, continued to
weakened in the run to the wire. MOUNTAIN PINE made little impact while racing four wide most of the way. WE THANK YOU was finished after five
furlongs racing toward the inside. MAMANEEDSNEWSHOES off a step slow, was always outrun while racing wide.

Footnotes
MACRON in the second flight outside, moved closer under confident handling three wide late in the turn, took over from the outside and drew clear under a
steady hand ride to win ridden out. FASTLY broke alertly, sprinted clear soon after, showed the way through the turn, offered brief resistance to the winner
into the lane, could not keep pace with that one the final furlong, remained clear for the runner up spot. MESA MOON forwardly placed along the inside,
continued to save ground through the turn, moved off the inside late, saved the show. EMPERADOR in the second flight early between horses, shuffled
back a bit in tight quarters into the turn, came three wide into the lane, gaining for the show spot late while out in the strip. BELFAST BOY lacked early
speed inside, continued along the rail through the turn, moved out a bit for the drive, came up flat the final furlong. BANDIT POINT void of speed, three wide
exiting the turn, also went one paced through the stretch. REPROBATE in mid pack while racing outside, four wide trip through the turn, lacked a closing
kick when called on for the drive. ROTARY DIAL raced back and off the inside, three to four wide through the turn, also failed to muster a closing rally.
BASEBALL POLITICS off the pace in the two path, moved slightly closer in the turn then backed up through the lane. MAS TAKELA off a step slow, trailed
throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S BATTLE forwardly placed into the first turn, moved out in the two path midway on that bend, prompted the leader up the backstretch, took over
far turn while still in hand, drew out through the stretch without being asked for his best. TONE IT UP took back at the start, lacked speed inside, moved out
and was three wide into the far turn, encountered some traffic soon after after beginning an advance, came four wide for the drive, finished willingly to be in
time for the second spot, no threat to the winner. DARE ME settled off the well off the inside, 5w onto the backstretch, closer 5-4w far turn, chased winner
past the furlong marker, caught for the place. MOHAYLADY void of early foot, moved well out into the strip in the run up the backstretch, four wide when
advancing in the second turn, flattened out a bit in the drive to lose a position. PURE ELEGANCE in the second flight outside, four down to three wide in the
second turn, remained one paced in the run down the lane. COST A FORTUNE steadied along the inside into the first turn, fell back the middle half when
shuffled in traffic far turn, made little impact in the drive. SAX within striking distance for a half, had little left for the drive. MUMBLEBEE broke on top, clear
in the two path into the first turn, dropped inside, showed the way up the backstretch, gave way when headed by the winner far turn. CANT BE TOUCHED
fractious in the gate, finished after a half, reported home well back.

Footnotes
BIG SUCCESS lacked early foot outside, fanned five wide out of the turn, set down for the drive, closed with good resolve to be up at the wire. YOU VEE
CEE away in good order, dueled up front in the two path, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home, drew clear under firm handling but then
could not hold the winner at bay late to be nipped at the wire. FORSAKEN broke well from along the inside, dueled up front closest to the inside, weakened
gradually through the stretch but had enough left to last for the show. BELLAMYS ROAN within striking distance while racing four wide, continued well wide
through the turn, lacked a winning response when called on for the drive. TRAFFIC CONTROL in the second flight off the rail, moved a bit closer while in
traffic midway on the turn, clear for the drive, came up empty. TOPF ROAD RULES in the second flight three wide and between horses, also was found
lacking when the real running began at the head of the lane. GHOST STRATEGY off slow, moved up the inside to race with the second ground into the turn,
traffic midway on the bend while remaining inside, weakened through the stretch. CATS GOTTA CHANCE main body outside, four wide through the turn,
lacked a kick in the stretch. LOUD BOY dropped inside for the turn, remained inside and also failed to rally. BRASKA broke back and was never a threat. I
STAN FOR LOVE also broke back and was never a factor. MAKE MY OWN LUCK lacked speed, had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
MARKET ANALYSIS broke on top, got clear before a quarter, set all the pace, larger lead stretch, kept to task. GOALIE forwardly placed while three wide
through most of the first turn, dropped inside, closer to the winner toward the inside late in the final turn, could do little more with that one through the stretch
while drawing comfortably clear of the others. SUPER CONSTITUTION settled off the pace along the inside, continued to save ground when improving
through the final turn, flattened out a bit through the stretch in proving no match for the top pair. ANTIGRAVITY void of speed off the inside, came five wide
into the lane when beginning a mild advance into the stretch, continued to improve a bit through the stretch while not a threat to the top three.
HIGHESTDISTINCTION four wide in the first turn, moved closer on the outside the third quarter, flattened out through the lane. CADDO RIVER fractious in
the gate, broke in good order, was forwardly placed early, two path through the final turn, failed to respond in the drive. CANDY TYCOON chased the winner
for six furlongs then gave way in the drive. SIMOVITCH settled off the pace while four wide through the first turn, continued outside, failed to rally.
PLENTIFUL last to leave, was not a factor. BRICE broke back, moved out, gave way while four wide through the final turn.

Footnotes
MISS MOSAIC prominent from the start off the inside, confidently handled while pressing the issue three wide through the turn, put a head in front when
straightened for home, roused past the furlong marker, enough left to hold the runner up safe in the waning strides. JOY'S ROCKET bobbled slightly at the
break, raced off the pace and the inside in the run up the backstretch, worked way out to be four wide by late in the turn while not making much progress,
shaken up for the drive in upper stretch, finished well to be coming outside the winner late. AIN'T NO ELMERS forwardly placed toward the inside,
maintained position along the inside through the turn and into the lane, roused with the winner for the drive, lacked a winning response while still inside,
caught late for the place. WILDWOOD'S BEAUTY behind the pace outside up the backstretch, remained four wide through the turn, continued evenly
through the lane in also lacking a knockout punch. CANDURA off a step slow, trailed early as a result, was three wide through the turn then improved
position with some moderate late interest through some traffic. LI'L TOOTSIE off a step slow, inside, improved into lane, dropped back to rail late, evenly
final strides. SARAH HARPER moved up to show the way up the backstretch, continued to set the pace turn while in the two path, headed by the winner
entering the stretch and began to weaken. ABROGATE off the pace, raced three out to five wide through the turn, lacked a closing kick. PERFECT
HAPPINESS forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch while off the inside, tapped on the brakes and steadied a bit into the turn, fell back then
continued to fade through the lane.

the final turn, fell back upper stretch, rebid again late while still well out in the strip, faltered. HOME RUN TRICK broke on top, set the pace in the two path,
turned back the winner turning for home to be clear again upper stretch, continued to hold a daylight advantage until late, caught final strides. DERBY
CODE settled in mid pack, steered out three wide turning into the stretch, had little for the top two late, finished well clear of the others. BEAR OAK lacked
speed, came in the two path behind the runner up into the stretch, displayed some mild interest to improve position. GAGOOTS in mid pack while three wide
early, came four wide out of the final turn, lacked a late punch. BOTSWANA off a step slow, raced well back in the two path through the second turn, passed
a couple of tiring foes to improve slightly late. CARL G forward early along the inside, saved ground again through the second bend when with the second
flight, backed up through the stretch. TASHKENT chased the runner up early, began a steady retreat before a half. ORIGINAL INTENT off a step slow,
