Footnotes
CON ON THE RUN broke out and bumped rival, sped to the front from off the rail then crossed to the inside, held a short lead through the turn, drifted out
and brushed TIZLIGHTNING in the lane and was able to hold on. TIZLIGHTNING hit gate at the start but quickly recovered, was forwardly placed to the
inside of the pacesetter then switch to the outside, applied pressure into and around the turn, got lightly brushed and floated out in the lane but kept on
gamely while unable to get by the winner. STREET ART chased on the inside then guided off the rail, went three wide around the turn, came dove down to
the inside in upper stretch and finished a clear third. CORUSCATION got bumped by the winner leaving the gate, well off the rail at the back, angled to the
rail around the turn and could not rally. MESA EMPIRE shifted in and checked early, chased along the inside at the back then moved out to the two path on
the turn and was outrun. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED CON ON THE RUN FROM FIRST TO SECOND FOR DRIFTING
OUT AND MAKING LIGHT CONTACT WITH TIZLIGHTNING, WHICH COST TIZLIGHTNING A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
FEELING GRAZEFUL sped to the front from inside, set the pace up the backstretch then vied with a pair of rivals into the second bend, dueled with SELF
ISOLATION past the five-sixteenths pole, bumped with that rival in upper stretch, cleared past the eighth pole and held well. KITTEN'S KID pulled early and
moved to the inside, steered out to the three path on the far turn, then finished willingly to earn the place honors. SELF ISOLATION rated in the two path
early on, bid three deep at the seven-sixteenths pole taking a brief lead, dueled into the stretch, bumped with rival in upper stretch and faltered in the late
stages. ELA CALIMERA MOU was crowded a bit at the start and dropped back to last, trailed in the early stages, went three to four wide around the far turn
and never threatened. TIZ MY PRINCESS raced on the inside in the early going, lacked room behind AUSTIN JAMES with a quarter mile left to run, stayed
inside to the stretch and never threatened. SHEZ OUR ARCH was unhurried in the early going, moved out on the backstretch then put in a mild bid four
deep at the seven-sixteenths pole, lost ground around that bend, chased three wide into the stretch, steadied in tight between rivals at the top of the stretch
and weakened. AUSTIN JAMES raced up close from outside early, applied pressure in the middle stages, vied between leaving the backstretch, raced in
tight quarters on the far turn between rivals, could not keep up past the five-sixteenths pole and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
HAIL COLUMBIA broke well then went up to clear early, met bids from a pair of rivals on the turn, moved clear once again in upper stretch and remained
strong to the wire. SO IT WOULD SEEM tracked in range from the far outside, went five deep into the turn, bid three deep with a quarter mile left to run,
fought on through the drive but could not get by the winner. UNSOLVED MYSTERY was off alertly, chased the lone leader three deep, bid two wide around
the turn and weakened in the stretch. LOMA VISTA broke in and bothered rival, chased between foes and bumped into the turn, exited the bend three wide
and kept on for a minor award. BASKET CASE raced off the rail early on at the back, angled to the fence for the turn, came two wide into the stretch,
steered out in the lane and improved position. ARDIS chased between foes while three deep early, bumped with rival into the turn, dropped back out of
contention on the bend and had could not rally in the drive. LUCY JANE was bothered from outside at the start, chased along the rail into and around the
bend and weakened. HARDDIANE raced outside a rival at the back, angled in on the turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
STREET RUCKUS stalked in the two path early on, bid outside the leader with three-eighths remaining, took control in upper stretch, then shook free from
ROSENQUIST at the sixteenth pole and inched away late. ROSENQUIST stalked three wide early, bid three deep on the far turn, fought with the winner to
the sixteenth, could not match that rival late and held the place. WORLD CRUISER was off slow, tracked in the two path on the clubhouse turn, came three
wide into the lane, moved out widest in the stretch and put in a mild late bid. HULK was off a bit slow then bumped soon after the start, sent to the front then
once clear was taken in hand and controlled the pace, vied with a pair of rivals leaving the far turn, was overtaken in upper stretch and weakened inside the
furlong grounds. EL JOY bumped with rival at the start, got crowded when rival came over early, rated in the two path in the early stages, driven two wide
into the lane, moved out upper stretch but lacked a late bid. BATUKHAN (IRE) stumbled leaving the gate to come away last, steered to the inside, shifted to
the two path on the far turn and could not rally. PRINCE ZIGGY was off slow to begin, went two wide around the first turn, three to four wide on the second
bend and was not a factor. NOTHNGOODCOMSEASY was crowded a bit early, stalked the pace along the rail to the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
UNTOUCHED ELEGANCE sped to the front then ceded the lead to take a stalking position, bid outside on the turn and took over at the five-sixteenths pole,
showed the way in the two path into the drive and held well over WIN OFTEN in the final furlong. WIN OFTEN was off alertly then moved back to stalk the
top pair, bid three deep with a quarter mile left to run but could not find the needed late kick to overtake the winner in the late stages. CANAM GAL got
bumped hard from outside at the start, chased two to three wide into the lane, angled out in the lane and lacked a late bid. DID I STUTTER raced off the
pace early on while widest up the backstretch, entered the turn five wide, angled in some and went three to four wide into the stretch and lacked a rally.
CALIFORNIA COOL was unhurried on the inside, saved ground then moved out at the top of the stretch and made no impact. RAIN DIVA stumbled, broke
in and bumped rival leaving the gate, recovered well to sprint to the front and take control then cleared, was challenged on the turn and gave up command
with five-sixteenths remaining and faded in the lane. MAJESTIC GIGI was off slow to begin, had her path taken soon after, went three then four wide on the
turn and was outrun.

ENCROACHMENT sped to the front and moved inside, gained company on the backstretch, dueled into the far turn, shook free past the quarter pole, felt
some pressure from COTOPAXI (IRE) in the lane but turned that rival away and held well to the line. COSMO settled early on the inside, went between foes
on the far turn, angled back to the rail leaving the bend and finished well to gain the place. COTOPAXI (IRE) rated in the two path, became rank
approaching the nine-sixteenths pole, exited the far turn three wide, bid outside in the lane but faltered in the deep stretch. ME B BUBBA T settled two then
three wide on the first turn, came three wide into the drive and improved position. ALGERIA (IRE) tracked three deep around both turns and lacked a rally.
DOMINANT SOUL chased in the two path on the first turn, went up to apply pressure in the middle stages, dueled into the far turn, could not keep up past
the quarter pole and weakened down the lane. BENDER stumbled leaving the gate, was rank between rivals on the first turn, traveled three then four wide
on the second bend and proved no menace. ENDLESS SUNSET was off slow to begin, pulled on the first turn, tipped two wide into the lane and was not a
factor. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) stalked the pace from inside, was coaxed along through the far turn but tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
SPIELBERG was off a bit slow to start, settled in the three path early, closed in around the far turn, drew alongside the top pair at the quarter pole, kicked
clear into the stretch and held safely. WICKED TRICK broke a bit slow, unhurried on the inside, steered out at the quarter pole and finished willingly to prove
second best. SURFING STAR was off a bit slow from outside, went four wide into the first turn then angled down to the two path, raced outside a rival on the
backstretch, angled out and came four wide into the lane and got up for the show. VITTORIO took control early, dueled with CLASSIER while opening up a
large lead on the rest of the field, battled to the quarter pole, relinquished the lead to the winner shortly after and weakened in the lane. CLASSIER dueled
for command from outside, started to weaken past the quarter pole and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
WELLSWORT (IRE) was hustled from inside to go to the front, dueled inside BROTHERLY LOVE for the lead, cleared that rival past the quarter pole,
moved off the rail in the drive, weakened a bit late but was able to hold on. EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT stalked the pace from inside, raced in mid-pack into the
far turn, swung out and went four to five wide into the drive, had the rider lose both his irons in upper stretch but rallied gamely. BROTHERLY LOVE was off
alertly, dueled outside WELLSWORT (IRE) for command, lost contact past the quarter pole and chased two wide into the lane, stayed within striking
distance in the drive and came back on in the final sixteenth but could not summon the needed final punch. MAYBE NEVER was off slow and lost his path
at the start, raced two wide into the far turn, three wide into the lane, weaved through traffic in upper stretch and rallied to earn a minor award. LOOKOUT
POINT got bumped from inside at the start, tucked inside on the first turn, went between foes at the half-mile pole, angled back to the rail leaving the
backstretch, rallied up the inside but was not enough. PINEDALE was off a bit slow from outside, went three then two wide on the first turn, saved ground
around the far turn and could not rally. LA'OCH ALOYSIUS lost a shoe entering the first turn then pulled and had to be angled out around the bend, went up
outside the top pair at the seven-sixteenths pole, chased the leader into the lane and weakened. MEMES broke out, got floated out by rival and steadied on
the first turn, was driven three wide into the lane, drifted inward in upper stretch and weakened. MONGOLIAN BONUS got shuffled back early, angled in on
the first turn, raced near the back up the backstretch, trailed a bit off the rail into the lane and was not a factor.
