Footnotes
RUNNINSONOFAGUN just off the inside in pursuit from near the rear, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and
advanced, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out a path and rallied issuing a challenge through the final furlong getting brushed and lightly
bumped by PRINTRACK a sixteenth from home, took command seventy yards from the finish and inched clear to the wire. PRINTRACK broke out at the
start bumping ALWAYS CHARMING, showed the way in hand along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, got set
down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat coming out under a left sided stick
slightly to brush and bump that rival before being collared with seventy yards to run, then ran on safely for the place honors. SILIPO bobbled at the start and
was forced to steady off the heels of HOBOKEN JACK who took over the lane in front, conceded four lengths to the front before settling into stride seven
paths off the inside down the backstretch, commenced a steady advance from the five-eighths and tucked five then four wide into the turn, came under
coaxing three wide at the three-eighths, bid into contention and swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive keeping on well clear of the rest for
the show honors. ALWAYS CHARMING got bumped at the start by PRINTRACK while under hustling from the gate, chased along the inside down the
backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. HOBOKEN
JACK coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, went four wide into upper stretch and tired. BUSTIN PIETRE
hustled from the start, chased forwardly placed just off the inside, got placed to coaxing midway on the turn, tipped three wide at the head of the stretch in
retreat and faltered.

Footnotes
SARATOGA BEAUTY brushed with a foe at the start, moved in while going to the front, set the pace in the two path while in hand, extended the advantage
when let out some approaching the quarter-pole, responded well when set down after straightening for the drive and drew off under a strong hand-ride to
prove much the best. WAIT A MINUTE broke in a tad at the start, was rated just off the pace on the inside, saved ground while asked on the turn, came off
the rail in the stretch and secured the place while no match for the winner. GRINGOTTS broke out and brushed with an opponent, tracked the pace on the
outside, chased in the three path around the turn and weakened but was clear for the show. JEN'S BATTLE broke a half-step slow, settled on the outside,
was roused with a half-mile to run, chased in the four path on the turn and came up empty. BIG AL'S GAL paused off heels early, was reserved under
restraint, rounded the turn in the two path while let out and failed to respond. PEACHES AND SPICE broke a step slow then dropped back, was urged along
at the rear on the outside, went around the turn in the five path and faltered.

Footnotes
GOOD SKATE was carried out while showing early speed, contested the pace between foes then inside of a rival, led along the rail on the turn, responded
well when set down into upper stretch and drew off under steady urging. SENSIBLECONCLUSION was hustled from the start, angled in under urging, went
around the turn in the two path, moved out under a drive into upper stretch and finished willingly for the place. NOBODYRIDESFORFREE broke out and
bobbled slightly then bumped lightly with a foe, was urged along on the outside, went three wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch and lacked the
needed response while best of the rest. KING OF HOLLYWOOD was hustled from the start, moved out while showing speed inside of two opponents,
dropped off the pace coming to the five-eighths pole, chased in the two path around the turn and came up empty. GOOD TIP bumped lightly with a rival at
the start then was hustled, tracked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, spun five wide into upper stretch, remained on his inside lead in
the drive and tired. IRIE SPICE was urged along at the rear, went two then three wide on the turn and was no factor. KOBE'S LEGACY angled in while
ridden along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, had the rider get the crop knocked out of his hand inside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. GUN
MAESTRO was hustled from the start then carried out early, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, floated four wide while
dropping back into upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
THERISASTORMBREWIN broke very fast and went straight to the lead then quickly angled in, showed the way on the inside through very sensible
fractions, was asked while challenged on the far turn, shook off STRAIGHT SKINNY under a drive in upper stretch and drew off under steady urging. SON
OF AN EX broke a bit slow then checked while pinched back, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was urged along while inside for most
of the far turn, swerved three wide at the five-sixteenths, moved out in upper stretch, raced under a right-handed crop while still on his inside lead into the
final furlong, switched to a left-handed crop coming to the sixteenth-pole, swapped to the proper lead inside the sixteenth-pole and finished with good
courage for the place. KODIAK BROWN broke out and bumped with a foe, was rated while inside to the two path, chased on the far turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive and weakened but just earned the show. MAKE IT IN NY brushed with a foe just after the start, settled outside in the three path,
chased around the final turn and tired then just missed the show. STRAIGHT SKINNY was bumped soundly at the start, went two to three wide on the first
turn, tracked the pace on the outside, issued a challenge in the two path on the final turn, lost touch with the winner while remaining on his inside lead in
upper stretch, swapped to the proper lead inside the furlong marker and capitulated. RUN FOR BOSTON brushed with an opponent just after the start,
dropped back early then angled in, saved ground around the opening bend, settled last but one, was urged three wide for most of the far turn, steadied
when carried out at the five-sixteenths and had nothing left.

DARK MONEY chased from just off the pace along the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a
challenge through the final furlong taking command near the sixteenth marker, then edged clear to the finish kept to task. STEAM ENGINE hustled from the
gate, showed the way from the two path under pressure early on, tucked inside through the turn and shook away through the latter portion before spinning
just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under lone threat to the outside, got collared a sixteenth from home and ran on well clear of the
rest to be along second best. WRITER'S REGRET chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch,
weakened in the late stages while clear for the show honors. GOLANI BRIGADE got bumped at the start by DREAM BIGGER, who broke inwards, chased
just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. DREAM BIGGER broke in at
the start bumping the aforementioned foe, prompted the pace three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, faded nearing the quarter pole and
went just off the inside into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. SICILIA MIKE chased from the tail of the field along the inside, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. MANIFEST DESTINY coaxed from the start, chased just off
the inside under a ride from midway on the turn, swung three wide for home and never threatened. BINKSTER chased five to six wide under coaxing from
the three-eighths, cornered six wide into upper stretch and tired. GANDY DANCING five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
went five wide into upper stretch and tired. P J ADVANTAGE broke out at the start and was corrected, chased along the inside under coaxing from the
