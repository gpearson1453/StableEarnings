Footnotes
M. J.'S LADY , in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, kept outside horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, bid for the lead outside
CAIRO QUEEN approaching the eighth pole, dueled with that one the final furlong and narrowly prevailed. CAIRO QUEEN gained a two wide lead on the
backstretch, remained in the two path on the far turn, was challenged by the winner approaching the eighth pole then gamely dueled with that one. MIKEY'S
JEWEL , along the inner rail on the turns, angled out in upper stretch and had a slight rally. LOVE IS STRONG , four wide the first turn, raced inside horses
entering the far turn, swung out turning for home and failed to rally. FLOWER'S FORTUNE stumbled leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the turns
and lacked a rally. GLORY MARCH , outrun, drifted wide in upper stretch. OFFLEE GRAYSFUL , three wide both turns, was no factor. WALK IT OUT
NANNY showed speed along the inner rail and gave way on the far turn.

Footnotes
SPITBALL , bumped at the break, chased three wide early on, shifted out a path and pursued outside rivals under asking mid turn, closed in steadily under
left handed asking, drifted out then back in past the sixteenth marker, bumped with ROYAL THUNDER when collaring that one in deep stretch then forged
ahead in the final jumps. ROYAL THUNDER sped to the front and took some outside pressure while two wide, shook clear heading towards the turn, raced
three wide under coaxing into the lane, drifted out some while under a hearty ride past the sixteenth pole, switched over to his left lead when bumping with
the winner and gave way grudgingly. RISING PERRY broke awkwardly and to the outside, corrected and then edged up between foes near the half mile
marker, chased between runners past the five sixteenths and into the lane, kept on willingly and gained a bit late. MUTAKAAMIL lacked speed and raced off
the rail leaving the far turn, moved up some three wide into the lane, swung out and churned on. VISUAL ARTIST , four wide stalking the early pace, was
under a ride three wide pursuing past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on near mid stretch and faded. TOP BOSS , bumped at the break, rushed up
between horses soon after and forced the pace outside ROYAL THUNDER, dropped in around the turn and faded. THE WOLFMAN saved ground with early
pursuit and gave way. ALPHA QUEUE was squeezed back early on, dropped well back into the turn, came four wide for the drive and came up empty.

around the turn, finished willingly. CALL IT LOVE , two wide on the turn, was never a factor. SOLOMON'S CHOICE , squeezed back soon after the break,
swung out leaving the turn, failed to rally and drifted out near the sixteenth pole. ORO GRIS was outrun. SUMMUM NOOR showed speed along the inner
rail and faltered on the turn.

JOHN THE BEAR prompted the pace three wide under some asking, moved alongside UNCLE ROAMIE leaving the far turn, gained a short lead past the
three eighths, maintained the advantage into the lane, finally shook clear under a drive nearing mid stretch then held firm while kept to task. POWER BACK
, taken to rate early and raced two wide between runners, shifted in towards the rail and edged up mid turn, remained inside giving chase past the three
sixteenths and finished gamely. UNCLE ROAMIE quickly went clear, set the early pace two wide, moved closer to the rail when meeting the winner's bid
leaving the far turn, fought on and made the winner work while guided to the three path into the stretch, continued a forward presence past the eighth pole
then gave way grudgingly. TRUSTYOURINSTINCT moved up between runners leaving the far turn, had aim past the five sixteenths, shifted in through the
final furlong but came up empty. GRAYWING stalked the pace four wide, ranged up outside rivals mid turn, failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths,
drifted out some and weakened. TRIPLE TITOS saved ground, eased back off foes into the turn, was guided out some, faded and was eased late.

Footnotes
MIDDLE ISLAND lacked speed, circled the turn four wide, floated to the six path turning for home, closed outside horses, led near the sixteenth pole then
drew out. DIAL ME MAYBE , four deep leaving the backstretch, gained the lead in upper stretch and finished well while no match for the winner. KOBE'S
GIRL , well off the rail between horses on the turn, flattened out. MISS SEDUCTIVE , under urging soon after the break, hugged the inner rail, was shuffled
back entering the turn, remained inside foes and finished willingly. CAMELIA ROD , wide throughout, had a mild rally. KEEN MACHINE , no factor, swung to
the seven path in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. BANTAM ROOSTER sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and weakened the final
furlong. IRISH CHAOS raced in the two path inside horses on the turn, raced between rivals in the stretch and failed to rally. SAFE REEZAN raced in the
two path on the turn, chased the pace and weakened. LA REINA SUSAN was outrun. HELLO JAMROCK faltered.

the stretch, ranged up outside WIN THEN GRIN nearing the wire then hung. LA DAME saved ground giving chase, stayed willingly to mid stretch then
faded. ELLIE BE DANCING , urged along three wide pursuing the winner, continued with interest to mid stretch then gave way. YOUKNOWWHATITIZZZ ,

CALYPSO GHOST hugged the inner rail chasing the early pace, gained command mid way on the turn, drifted off the rail turning for home and held sway
under steady handling. PARCHED GHOST , angled in soon after the start, saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and closed
gamely. BLUE SKY VENEZUELA well positioned four deep on the turn, failed to rally. LADY MAGICA showed speed in the two path down the backstretch
and around the turn then gradually weakened in the drive. DAT DARES GOLD , in the three path between horses on the turn, chased the pace to the stretch
then gave way. WILDLY GOOD LOOKIN , pinched back leaving the starting gate, was outrun.

Footnotes
ALOTTAHOPE disputed the early pace two wide between rivals, was deftly taken back off the leaders into the turn, came back on from between runners
mid turn, eased out three wide to have aim on CAPT. CANDY into the stretch, closed in under strong handling and took over inside the furlong grounds,
eagerly kicked clear and was steadily hand ridden through the final yards. CAPT. CANDY was sent up between foes soon after the break and contested the
pace, poked a head in front near the half mile marker, dropped in towards the rail soon after, took outside pressure leaving the three eighths, shook clear
under a drive, braced for the challenge in mid stretch then gave way grudgingly in the final sixteenth. HEFFNER , urged along three and four wide pursuing
the pace, shifted out wider for the drive and closed willingly through the final furlong. OSKEE WOW WOW , away slowly, angled towards the inner rail
nearing the turn, came back out making some headway near the stretch, advanced between foes in mid stretch then flattened out. AL LOVES JOSIE vied
five wide outside rivals early on, was hung out four wide forcing the pace mid turn, remained wide for the drive and came up empty. KOZY'S WILDCAT
dueled early inside a host of rivals, eased back a bit into the turn, remained close up under coaxing into the lane then faded through the final furlong.
BAYTOWN FROSTY , away alertly, forced the pace three wide between foes, stayed on to about the head of the lane then gave way. CAJUN INVASION ,
four wide nearing the half mile marker, failed to menace.

Footnotes
MAMA G'S WISH stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced in the three path between horses mid way on the turn, challenged for the lead entering
the stretch, dueled inside SEA PINES through the lane and drove clear. SEA PINES advanced four deep leaving the turn, bid for the lead outside MAMA
G'S WISH turning for home, dueled with that one and proved second best in a game effort. QUEEN CASHMERE , a forward factor in the two path around
the turn and in upper stretch, finished willingly. I'M GITTIN THERE sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail setting the pace and gradually weakened
through the lane. SKYLAR'S LADY showed brief speed two wide down the backstretch, failed to keep pace, saved ground on the turn and swung wide in
upper stretch. JERUSALEMA lacked speed, raced near the inner rail on the turn, swung very wide in upper stretch and showed some late interest. SWEET
TALIA , unhurried down the backstretch, was no factor.
