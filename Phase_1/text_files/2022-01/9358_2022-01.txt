Footnotes
NIMITZ CLASS set a pressured pace early from the inside, drew clear on the turn and then drew off in the drive to prove much the best under right handed
pressure. KAZ SWEET HEIST pressed the early pace in between rivals, then was two to three wide on the turn while chasing the winner, came four wide
into the drive and finished willingly but was no match to the winner while clearly second best. BUFF AND SHINE pressed the early pace three to four wide
and in between rivals, then dropped down to the inside by the quarter pole and weakened. RISEN SAVIOR stalked the early pace four to five wide, then was
three wide by the quarter pole and came up empty.

RAISETONEW HEIGHTS prompted the early pace three wide, then made a bid to vie for command by the half mile marker, took over on the turn and
moved to the inside, drew off leaving the turn to prove much the best under a drive. COLOR FORCE set the early pace and then vied for command on the
backstretch, fell off the pace on the turn, tipped out leaving the turn for racing room and finished willingly to be clearly second best. TUXEDO LEMON was
allowed to settle and raced five wide on the backstretch, then split rivals by the furlong marker and was along for the show award. GRACEYGAB was well
placed early on the inside and weakened. PRIDE IN THE BIZ was rated along early, made a five wide move on the turn to be in contention by the quarter
pole and weakened. REVOLUTIONARY MARY tracked the early pace four wide, then made a three wide bid on the turn and tired. ATTENTIVELY was
rated along early, made a four wide move on the turn and then was empty.

DON'T LOSEMYMONEY set the early pace and turned back a bid leaving the quarter pole and drew clear to prove best under right handed crop urging.
TRENDING UP was rated along five wide early, made a four wide bid on the turn but flattened out, second best. GOSIGNAL was well placed along the
inside, tipped out three wide leaving the turn but lacked the needed stretch bid, bested rest. TUCKERTON BAY stalked the early pace four wide and
weakened. MIDDLE EARTH was reserved early on the inside, eased out on the turn and was four wide by the quarter pole and offered no rally. LEAVE 'EM
LOADED stalked the early pace two to three wide and in between horses and weakened.

BROAD STREET BULLY broke inward at the start, then settled early on the inside, advanced on the turn two wide, was between horses and boxed by the
quarter pole, tipped out four wide leaving the turn, made a bid in the stretch and got up late to prove best under a drive. STUDIO B pressed the early pace
three wide, made a two to three wide bid on the turn to vie for command leaving the turn, gained a short advantage leaving the furlong maker, but was
caught late by the winner, outfinished late. ZERTZ was well placed early on the inside, made a inside bid leaving the turn on the inside, but lacked room
when straightened to the furlong marker, angled out in the furlong grounds and got the show award. THE SICARII checked after the start, then was settled
in the back early, advanced five wide on the turn, came six wide into the drive and had a even finish late to just miss the show award. FLANK SPEED set a
pressured pace on the inside, then vied for command leaving the quarter pole on the inside and weakened in the drive. KITTEN'S SOLUTION lacked a rally.
MARTINKELLY tracked the early pace and made a four to five wide bid nearing the quarter pole then came up empty in the drive.
