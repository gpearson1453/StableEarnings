Footnotes
CORT'N ASONG gained a forward placing stalking the pacesetter through the backstretch, moved to close the gap on that foe entering the turn, pressed the
issue in the three path racing into upper stretch and took over late under firm left handed encouragement. CANDY CRUSHEM, off a step slowly, angled to
the inside tracking the leaders through the backstretch, was prompted to advance racing nearest the rail into upper stretch and edged a rival for the place
honors while failing to match the winner's kick. SHWEET PERSUASION, urged clear along the inside racing past the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow
margin through the turn, tipped out to the three path racing into the stretch while being roused to resist his challengers past midstretch, yielded to the top
pair late. YAK tracked off the leaders from out of striking distance outside foes in the opening half, was prompted to gain contention in the four path racing
past midstretch but finished evenly late. KILLEEN angled inwards racing through the backstretch to track the leaders between foes to the turn, was
prompted to advance entering the lane but lacked the needed final bid. PAINTER'S PRIDE, off a bit slowly, trailed the field throughout.

Footnotes
OPTIMAL COURAGE, crowded between rivals at the start, was forced inwards a bit in the opening stages when repeatedly bumped by RUNNING
VIOLENCE, was urged to gain some position between foes while tipping to the three path nearing the bend crossing over the path of RUNNING VIOLENCE,
continued with a steady advance three wide into upper stretch and wrested the advantage in the closing stages under firm right handed encouragement.
PAPA LUKE sprinted clear of the field in the opening stages while angling sharply to the inside, dictated the pace a bit off the rail racing into the turn,
resisted the winner's bid racing into upper stretch but proved no match for that rival late. SWINGIN FRIAR was off slowly, settled out of striking distance
along the inside on the backstretch, was prompted to advance splitting foes into upper stretch, then shifted out four wide racing past the sixteenth marker
and continued to make some mild progress to the end while prevailing for a share on the wire. RUNNING VIOLENCE broke inwards bumping RHOMBUS at
the start, shifted in sharply avoiding PELUCHIN CHIN just after the break making repeated contact with the eventual winner, was urged three deep between
foes to gain a position in the second flight racing through the backstretch, lost some position when caught in tight quarters while clipping heels with the
eventual winner approaching the seven sixteenths marker, was collected, then switched outside foes to advance five wide into the lane but was outkicked
for a share. VALID EXCHANGE broke inwards, was urged to a forward placing tracking the pacesetter inside rivals into the bend, saved ground through the
turn and was prompted to bid inside foes racing into upper stretch but came up empty late. RHOMBUS, bumped, squeezed, then shuffled back avoiding
tight quarters at the start, never gained contention. PELUCHIN CHIN shied inwards in the opening stages crowding several rivals, was righted to track the
pacesetter four wide in second flight through the backstretch but emptied out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEARING THE TURN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
MISS Z, taken in hand while guided to the inside racing through the chute, continued under patient handling while tipping off the inside approaching the
second bend, responded with a sharp rally while switching out four wide racing past the midway point of the far turn to challenge for command in that path
racing through upper stretch and went forward late under firm handling. READY TO FILM was rated between rivals just off the first flight racing to the
backstretch, shifted out three deep avoiding LAP OF LUXURY on the backstretch, continued between foes into the far turn, angled to the inside to split foes,
then bid along the rail racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to the end while just failing to match the winner. I'M BUZZY was rated off the second
flight outside the eventual winner racing to the backstretch, shifted out four deep nearing the second bend, was prompted to advance three wide between
foes challenging for command racing into upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. NOVELERA was rated just off the first flight along the inside to the
backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, angled out four wide entering upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. LAP OF LUXURY, in
touch with the leaders between foes attending the pace to the backstretch, was eased off the pace after a half, was held up momentarily when racing in
some close quarters entering the second bend, was prompted to advance while being fanned five wide into the lane but lacked the needed late response.
SUMMER HELPER, caught four wide leaving the chute, continued in that path to the first turn, shifted inwards to advance three deep pressing the issue
nearing the second bend, dueled into upper stretch and gave way. FLOURISHING, urged inside rivals prompting the pace in the opening half, dueled for
command into the far turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. MOLLIES HOPE, in touch three deep prompting the pace to the backstretch, dueled for
command between foes into the second bend while shifting to the inside and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
CSILLA broke readily, prompted the pace between rivals racing in the three path through the opening quarter, shifted inwards disputing the issue into the
turn edged forward racing into upper stretch and drew clear late under left handed pressure. CRYSTAL ORB, urged to a forward placing along the inside
tracking just off the leaders racing to the turn, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch splitting foes while being prompted to advance but proved only
second best. R TENDERONI, urged just off the inside disputing the pace inside rivals into the turn, pressed the issue into upper stretch and gave way.
MELANCHOLY BLUES tracked just off the first flight outside a rival racing into the turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch but offered no rally.
CHARGING RENEE was settled off the second flight along the inside on the backstretch, momentarily awaited an opening near the inside approaching
upper stretch, then continued evenly inside rivals in the closing stages. FROST WARRIOR, urged prompting the pace three wide in the four path in the
opening stages, continued three deep pursuing the leaders into the turn, was fanned four wide approaching upper stretch and gave way, then dropped back
through the lane while his rider gathered up his mount through the final three sixteenths. LADY MIDAS was settled last on the backstretch and failed to
menace thereafter. RENNINAS ROSE dropped well back early and proved no factor.

Footnotes
IDAKA, urged to join the pace three deep racing through the chute, angled to the inside entering the first turn setting the pace on a narrow margin to the
backstretch, then held sway throughout under steady handling to remain clear to the wire. SWEET TINA tracked off the second flight between foes racing to
the backstretch, switched outside foes to advance three, then four wide racing through the far turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch but continued
with a steady late response to edge a rival for the place honors. KIZZY, urged to a forward placing along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter, tipped
out racing into upper stretch while being roused to advance but couldn't gain terms with the winner while just missing for second. AWILDAS TREASURE,
pulling a bit in the opening stages, tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the far turn, briefly awaited an opening shifting off the rail nearing
the lane, then angled to the inside while lacking the needed final kick. CHA CHA MISSION settled outside rivals in the opening stages, raced four wide
through the first turn to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three wide racing into the far turn to make some brief progress but flattened out in the
drive. LADY MANHATTAN, reserved inside foes racing to the far turn, offered no rally. PURTIZ, pulled between foes racing through the chute to gain a
forward placing, tracked just off the pacesetter outside a rival to the backstretch, was prompted to challenge the leader nearing upper stretch but emptied
out abruptly entering the lane. SARATOGA LULLABY was rated three wide between foes to the backstretch and never gained contention. CHIACHIARONE,
caught a bit wide racing to the backstretch tracking just off the second flight, retreated early. KITTENS MISS MOJO, off slowly, settled between foes in the
last flight, was steadied out of tight quarters racing into the first turn and dropped out early.

Footnotes
FEELING MISCHIEF angled inwards in the opening stages to track just off the pacesetter three wide through the backstretch, was prompted to advance in
that path through the bend, moved to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, then wrested the advantage and edged forward under firm
encouragement. TAP DANCE FEVER, forwardly placed along the inside racing just off the pacesetter, came through close quarters inside that rival to
challenge for command nearing upper stretch, tipped off the inside to dispute the lead inside the eventual winner racing through the stretch but proved only
second best. CLAY'S MOON STONE tracked just off the pacesetter between foes racing through the backstretch, angled to the rail entering the stretch and
continued evenly inside the top pair late while prevailing for a share. BAHAMIAN MOON, urged to the lead from the outset racing a bit off the rail, dueled for
command into the turn and gave way between foes entering the lane. GRAMERCY was settled last outside foes on the backstretch, came under pressure to
advance racing five wide into the turn and soon emptied out. CAUGHT UP IN YOU tracked just off the second flight four wide between foes, continued in
brief pursuit in that path into the turn but soon gave way.

Footnotes
ALABAMA SLAMMER moved to gain a forward placing three deep racing through the chute to track just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, conceded
some position under patient handling after a half, was prompted to advance three deep on the far turn, was carried out racing into upper stretch, shifted in,
then out under pressure in the closing stages but edged forward to prevail under firm encouragement. CALL BROS was rated outside a rival off the second
flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance outside foes entering the far turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch, exchanged some
contact with YES SIR ROBERT in the closing stages but continued with late momentum to edge a rival for the place honors. THENORTHREMEMBERS,
rated inside foes to the backstretch, tipped out after a half while being prompted to advance, advanced through close quarters splitting rivals just off the
inside to bid along the rail racing into upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. YES SIR ROBERT was rated along the inside just off the second flight
to the backstretch, tipped out racing through the far turn to gain position three deep between foes in the lane, altered course when momentarily losing his
path to the eventual winner leaving midstretch while exchanging some contact with CALL BROS and lacked the needed final kick. BRIDGEKEEPER settled
last to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into the stretch, drifted out under pressure in the closing stages and made no real impression. BEE BY
THE SEA, pulling between foes tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, shifted outside the leader to lodge a brief bid nearing upper stretch, drifted
out carrying out the eventual winner disputing the issue into upper stretch and gave way in late stages. SPIRITUAL KING tracked the pacesetter inside foes
as part of the second flight to the far turn, raced in close quarters leaving the midway point of the far turn and came up empty in the drive. BRILLIANT
JOURNEY sped to the lead while angling to the inside leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn and gave out racing into upper
stretch. MONTAUK SUMMER tracked off the second flight outside rivals to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while caught four wide racing into the
far turn and soon faded. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF YES SIR ROBERT LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF CALL
BROS ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
RUMPOLE angled inwards in the opening stages to force the pace three deep on the backstretch, pressed the issue outside a rival through the turn, edged
forward while shifting out in upper stretch, then held STRIKING HEIR on a safe margin to the end under brisk handling. The latter was prompted to a
forward placing along the inside, eased off the leaders nearing the bend, tipped out three wide approaching upper stretch while being prompted to advance,
pressed the issue outside the winner through the last furlong but couldn't even terms with that rival. MR LIGHTNING BOY tracked off the first flight between
foes on the backstretch, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to gain position while earning a share. WILD WINTER, off
slowly, was settled last racing to the turn, shifted three wide nearing upper stretch and improve position between foes to the end. ROCKYSBUCKAROO,
urged between foes, then along the inside disputing the lead inside the eventual winner into the bend, was going a bit erratically entering the stretch and
soon gave way. CLIFFY tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to the lane and continued evenly. OLD TIMER'S DAY tracked the
leaders outside rivals in second flight in early stages, was fanned five wide nearing upper stretch and steadily faded. OHIO MUNNY settled outside foes in
early stages and proved no threat. VICTOR'S DESTINY dropped out early.

Footnotes
WONDER WATER, pulling a bit in the opening stages, was rated tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance leading the second flight on a narrow
margin racing off the rail to the backstretch, steadily gained on the leaders three wide leaving the far turn, swerved in sharply while being roused to advance
entering upper stretch crossing over the path of STRONG EAGLE forcing that rival into the path of PLAYING GOLD, continued with solid momentum to bid
inside the leader, quickly wrested the advantage and went clear under pressure. THE DUNGEON, reserved between foes in the last flight to the
backstretch, gradually gained momentum splitting rivals entering upper stretch while carrying out FERGUS entering the lane but continued four deep in the
closing stages with a steady effort to narrowly prevail for the place honors in time. ANGEL'S MAGIC was prompted to a forward placing racing three deep
leaving the chute, shifted inwards nearing the backstretch stalking just off the pacesetter, moved to press that foe after a half, went clear racing through the
far turn, was roused to extend the advantage into upper stretch but failed to sustain his momentum. STRONG EAGLE was rated along the inside tracking
just off the leaders as part of the second flight to the far turn, tipped off the inside to close the gap on the leader between foes entering the lane, was
immediately forced in by WONDER WATER into the path of PLAYING GOLD, was then righted while shifting out and being prompted to advance but had no
further response. PLAYING GOLD, urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin in the opening half, proved no match when confronted by
ANGEL'S MAGIC on the backstretch, continued in pursuit of that foe through the far turn, then was carried in entering the stretch while giving way. GREAT
JUNIOR was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the far turn, saved ground on the second bend, steadied, then altered course avoiding
traffic entering upper stretch and had no late response. FERGUS tracked the leaders three deep in second flight in the opening half, continued in that path
into the far turn, lost some momentum nearing upper stretch, then was carried out entering the lane and proved empty in the drive. JUPITER RAIN was
