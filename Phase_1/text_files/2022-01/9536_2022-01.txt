Footnotes
LORD BERRIER was urged inside a rival disputing the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, forged clear leaving the turn under pressure
and was taken in hand in late stages. M V SPEED tracked just off the pacesetter inside foes through the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and
proved best of the others. QUICK INTRO, loose momentarily after dislodging his rider in the parade to post, tracked off the first flight three wide between
foes in the opening stages, eased back from that position nearing the turn, shifted inwards approaching upper stretch and continued with an effort to regain
some position between rivals. SANDY KISS tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, continued in pursuit of the eventual winner to upper stretch
and gave way. STREAKING GREY angled inwards prompting the pacesetter in the opening stages but gave way racing into the bend.
READTHETRANSCRIPT switched out four wide tracking the leaders in second flight and emptied out racing into the bend. SMALL JOHN tracked just off the
leaders between foes on the backstretch but faded early.

Footnotes
MYSTERY MO angled to the inside tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance racing to the turn, tipped out three deep nearing upper stretch,
moved to wrest command racing past the furlong marker under firm left handed encouragement, then was taken in hand approaching the wire. MONEY
SONG urged along the inside disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, dueled to midstretch but couldn't contain the winner while edging a
rival for the place honors. TIZ HANDSOME was urged pressing the pace outside a rival from the outset, continued to press the issue past midstretch but
weakened late while just missing for second. FIRSTCADETE broke inwards, was settled off the second flight racing three deep on the backstretch, then
continued evenly in that path to late stages. JIMMY THE KID tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight on the backstretch, shifted to the
inside racing through the turn but offered no rally. HE'S ROYALTY raced four wide on the backstretch and soon dropped out.

BERHANU was urged inside rivals disputing the pace through the backstretch while a bit off the inside, edged clear remaining a bit off the rail entering the
turn, then continued with a steady effort racing into the lane to gamely hold IMPERIAL BREW on a narrow advantage under firm handling to the end. The
latter broke inwards, tracked off the first flight three wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards approaching the bend to advance between foes, drifted
inwards bumping PREFERRED OUTCOME nearing the midway point of the bend, switched outside the leader while moving to terms with that foe nearing
midstretch but proved only second best. CANDY MY BOY was settled off the second flight racing to the turn, was prompted to advance while shifting out
five wide nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share late. PREFERRED OUTCOME tracked just off the leaders along the
rail racing into the turn, was bumped, then steadied sharply out of tight quarters nearing the midway point of the turn, shifted a bit off the inside racing into
the lane while being prompted to close the gap on the leaders but was outkicked for a share. THE GREAT LOUDINI, off slowly, switched outside foes racing
into the bend and made some belated progress five wide in the closing stages. SOURCESANDMETHODS tracked the leaders between rivals in second
flight on the backstretch, shifted out four wide nearing the lane and passed some tiring foes late. BETTING ON RED, urged three wide pressing the pace
through the backstretch, continued in pursuit of the eventual winner outside foes into the turn and gave way nearing the lane. TANGLED WEB vied briefly
for command between foes racing to the turn and gave way after three furlongs. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF IMPERIAL BREW LODGED A
CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY. AFTER REVIEWING THE INCIDENT ON
THE TURN, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED IMPERIAL BREW FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HIM FOURTH.

Footnotes
TONY SMALL, unhurried three deep between foes tracking off the second flight in the opening stages, angled inwards racing into the bend while being
prompted to advance, moved to challenge for command inside the pacesetter racing past the three sixteenths marker, then held the challenge of
BOURBON WISDOM through late stages under pressure. The latter, reserved outside foes on the backstretch, was prompted to gain some position while
shifting inwards on the turn, angled to the rail entering upper stretch to loom inside the winner racing past midstretch but was outkicked. NATIVE HAWK
switched outside foes early, then was prompted in pursuit of the pacesetter three, then four wide into the stretch and continued to close the gap while
proving no match for the top pair. ARRIVEDERLA sprinted clear of the field on the backstretch, held sway racing well off the rail through the turn, couldn't
contain the winner and weakened between rivals late. PREPARE FOR GLORY settled near the inside in early stages, angled outside foes racing into the
lane but offered no rally. LITIGANT, forwardly placed between foes tracking the pacesetter, was urged in pursuit of that foe between foes to the turn and
emptied out early.

Footnotes
ORIGO was rated along the inside tracking just off the leaders to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while shifting out nearing upper stretch, was
urged to challenge for command while caught four wide racing past the furlong marker but continued with a steady response to prevail between rivals under
firm handling. ROCK THE STARS tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, was prompted to advance racing three deep between foes
leaving the fa turn, was fanned five wide racing through the stretch but kept on willingly to edge a rival for the place honors late. STEALTH MISSION was
rated off the eventual winner along the inside racing to the backstretch, came under pressure to advance racing through the far turn, tipped out to bid three
wide between foes nearing midstretch while racing in some close quarters but was outkicked by the top pair. COMMANDER BIZ, pulling against restraint
while moving to terms with a rival racing through the chute, was urged to gain the lead angling to the inside on the first turn, set the pace on a clear margin
into the backstretch, met a rival's challenge racing through the far turn past midstretch but weakened late. WINTER'S GHOST tracked the leaders outside
the eventual winner as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, was fanned four wide racing into the lane, continued in close quarters to midstretch
but lacked the needed final kick. SIR SAFFER, forwardly placed along the rail leaving the chute, switched outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch
tracking just off that foe, advanced to press the issue on the far turn to upper stretch while striking the front but failed to sustain that momentum. BRAMBLE
BEACH, reserved near the inside dropping well off the second flight in the opening half, was prompted to advance while caught four wide racing into the far
turn and had no closing bid. ACTION DREAM settled outside a rival dropping well off the leaders racing to the backstretch and never gained contention.
KUNIK settled into stride along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground throughout but proved no factor.

CAJUN SPICE, bumped at the start, was prompted to gain a position just off the leaders while tipping off the inside on the backstretch, steadily drew into
striking position while shifting out three wide racing into upper stretch, bid for command nearing the furlong marker, shifted inwards under pressure but
prevailed in time under firm handling. RANSOMS REWARD was settled between foes dropping off the second flight racing to the turn, was prompted to
advance splitting rivals just off the inside racing into upper stretch and continued with a solid rally while altering course three deep in the closing stages to
edge a rival for the place honors. SHES ASTYLISH KATZ broke inwards bumping the eventual winner, was urged to a contending position inside the
pacesetter, was prompted to press the issue inside that foe racing into the turn, edged forward to a clear advantage entering the lane but yielded to the top
pair nearing the wire. CALIDAD, raced unhurried five wide tracking just off the second flight in early stages, continued four wide through the turn to the lane
while being prompted to advance but continued evenly to late stages. ROYAL GOLD DIGGER was urged to set the pace on a narrow advantage racing a bit
off the rail to the turn, dueled outside a rival through the bend but came up empty in the drive. SHE'S SO SERIOUS settled between foes in early stages,
angled to the inside on the turn while being prompted to gain some position but lacked the needed closing bid. PRINCESS LACIE proved no factor. DOES
SHE KNOW, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening stages, gave way between foes racing into the turn.

Footnotes
NAPOLEONIC WAR was reserved between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out three deep while being prompted to advance racing
into the far turn, continued four deep midway through the turn, angled inwards splitting rivals nearing upper stretch, then was urged to bid inside the leader
in the closing stages to strike the front in time under firm handling. SEIGNEUR, forwardly placed stalking the pacesetter between foes in the opening half,
advanced to press the issue between rivals on the far turn, moved to a clear advantage racing into the stretch and just held a rival's challenge to finish on
even terms at the wire. UNEXPECTED OUTCOME (IRE) was rated off the second flight while switching outside foes racing to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance four wide racing into the far turn to briefly gain terms with the leaders nearing upper stretch but quickly flattened out. BOLT FROM
THE BLUE, pulled his way to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch, dueled inside
rivals racing through the far turn and gave way into the lane. LUDO raced three deep to the backstretch tracking just outside the pacesetter in the opening
half, was prompted to make a brief bid between foes racing into the far turn but quickly came up empty. BATTLING BAILIFF, pulled hard against restraint
racing through the chute, then shifted out on the first turn while racing rankly between foes tracking just off the second flight to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance shifting three wide nearing the lane but soon faded. BAGE, urged to a forward placing while angling to the inside racing to the first
turn, tracked just off the pacesetter to the second bend and steadily faded nearing the lane. MACHINEGUNPREACHER was settled along the inside to the
backstretch, switched outside foes to race five wide into the far turn and never gained contention. SERIFOS tracked off the second flight under light rating
along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground into the far turn, then was shuffled back behind a tiring foe nearing the lane while lacking a closing
response.

Footnotes
AKEMI broke readily, was urged clear setting the pace on a commanding margin along the inside racing into the bend, then responded to stout pressure
nearing upper stretch to turn back BLAZE AWAY N HIDE and go well clear under strong handling. The latter shifted inwards while being urged pursuing the
pacesetter into the turn, moved to close the gap on that rival nearing upper stretch but proved no match while besting the others. SAVE THE FLAG, caught
six wide in the opening stages, conceded some position nearing the turn, was prompted to advance four wide racing through the turn, then continued with
interest outside foes to gain a share in the closing stages. MORE MUCHO tracked the pacesetter three wide as part of the second flight racing to the turn,
shifted inwards racing into the lane and continued evenly between rivals late. QUEEN'S BEST tracked the pacesetter inside rivals in second flight, saved
ground to the lane but offered no rally. CARLA'S HONOR tracked off the second flight along the inside racing into the turn, tipped out entering the lane and
continued with an effort to gain some position while no real threat. STARSHIP MACYS, bumped at the start, was settled between foes, then angled out five
wide nearing the lane to gain position while making no real impact. NIGHTMIDST tracked off the second flight three wide between foes racing to the turn
and steadily faded into the lane. OUR ELECTRA GUITAR tracked just off the second flight inside foes racing to the turn and gave way into upper stretch.
KLASSI KASSI broke inwards bumping a rival and dropped out early. ROMA MONA, caught four wide between foes racing behind the second flight to the
turn, retreated early. FOXY AUSTIN dropped out early.

COCHISE CHARLIE gained a position three deep in second flight racing to the first turn, continued outside a rival on the backstretch, was prompted to
advance while shifting out four deep to bid between foes nearing upper stretch, then contested the issue outside CLEVER FELLOW in that path in the
closing stages to narrowly prevail in time under firm handling. The latter was rated just off the leaders along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved
ground under patient handling on the far turn, shifted out to bid three wide between foes racing into upper stretch, struck the front between foes, then
grudgingly resisted the winner to late stages but proved only second best. REINER was settled off the second flight a bit off the inside racing to the
backstretch, swung out midway through the far turn while being roused to advance, was fanned five wide into upper stretch but couldn't match terms with
the top pair while edging a rival for a share. BARAHIN, forwardly placed three deep between foes racing through the chute, was eased back off the leaders
racing into the first turn while angling to the inside, saved ground on the far turn then came through some close quarters entering the stretch but continued
with interest to improve position. WESTWARD LOOK, urged prompting the pace between foes from the outset, dueled for command into the far turn and
gave way racing into the lane. WHISKEY PLANK, urged along the inside disputing the pace, pressed the issue into the far turn and gave way. JAMA
DILLON, caught in close quarters at the start, settled along the inside to the backstretch, swung out six wide racing into upper stretch but offered no rally.
DYNAMORE settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and never proved a threat. HYPE MAN was settled between foes in the last flight
to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. LUCA DREW THE ACE, urged to a forward placing three deep racing just off the leaders in early stages,
moved to prompt those foes in that path racing through the backstretch and gave out leaving the far turn.
