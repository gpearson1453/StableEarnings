Footnotes
CHANTAL sprinted clear at once, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off through the lane when asked. BONES AND ROSES was reserved
just off the leaders from the inside, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. XYLOPHONE settled off the leaders early,
raced off the rail through the second turn and finished with good energy. PLUMA chased the leaders while racing three-wide, angled in with a furlong to run
and gave way in the drive. SEVEN POINTS was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished evenly. SLEW
SOUTH was void of early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not threaten. BACK TO BUSINESS lacked early speed, raced four-wide through
the turn and was not a factor. PREDETERMINATION chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gradually weakened. UNUSUAL DANCER lacked
early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
INDIAN GAMBLER broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside with AUTISM CAN DO, vied with that rival through a vigorous drive and held gamely.
AUTISM CAN DO was away in good order to duel for the lead with the winner while racing three-wide, vied into deep stretch and just missed in a game
effort. LIMITED OFFER was forwardly placed from the inside, remained inside for the drive but failed to gain late. LITIGATOR settled off the leaders early,
moved six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. MR CHARLIE KING was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved seven-wide through the
turn and found his best stride late. BIG TONY chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. ROUGE SUNSET raced off
the leaders from between foes and gradually weakened. FRED was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TURN AT
TED'S lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
ARABIAN STORY dueled for the lead from the inside, opened a clear margin into the lane and was fully extended to hold AZEE RULES safe late. AZEE
RULES stalked the leaders while racing five-wide, moved up for a striking position in mid-stretch, rider lost whip nearing the sixteenth pole and rallied late.
FANTASTIC DAY was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and at the sixteenth pole and
finished with good energy. MYSTIC REALITY broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner while racing four-wide and gave way after going a half.
MARDEN settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished willingly. REELFOOT showed no early
speed, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CAUSE AND EFFECT was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and did not
reach contention. WHIDBEY PRINCE raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC EAGLE tracked the pace of TIGER DAD from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch, reached that rival with a furlong to run and drew
off. TIGER DAD disputed the pace from the inside, opened a clear margin into the stretch, could not match stride with the winner in the drive but finished
well to hold the place. ZOFFARELLI (IRE) was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached a striking position but failed to
sustain his rally. LOOSE DIAMOND settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and
finished with some late run. ZUMURUDEE was void of early speed, saved ground through the second turn and finished evenly in the drive. JACKS
OUTLAW showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn and was not a factor. K P ALL SYSTEMS GO steadied soon after the start,
lacked early speed, steadied again from distressed horse nearing the quarter and did not reach contention thereafter. BEDROCK raced four-wide through
the first turn, lacked early speed, lost rider when contacting distressed horse nearing the quarter and was walked off. RAAGHEB disputed the pace while
racing three-wide, went wrong and was pulled up nearing the quarter and vanned off.
