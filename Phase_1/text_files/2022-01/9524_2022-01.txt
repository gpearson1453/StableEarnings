Footnotes
BACKSHOT vied for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the lane with DREWZANO and proved the best. DREWZANO
challenged on the front end, raced close throughout, dueled down the lane, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. SPANKHURST showed
early speed, eased back, made a late try, proved no match for the top two, but got up for show. LOVER BOY pressed the pace, saved ground around the
turn and lacked a late kick. JAZZ IT UP was an early factor and weakened. GREY ROGUE pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn, put forth an
even effort and lacked a finish. DUST EM lacked early speed and was never a threat. WARRIORS GEM raced evenly near the back, came around the turn
on the outside, finished wide and was no factor. LIMBO'S PROMISE broke in, void of early speed and showed little. HOSTILE AFLEET always raced near
the back and was outrun.

Footnotes
SLEWPY'S HALO pressed the pace, raced outside around the first turn, dueled down the home stretch and proved the best late. MY AVANI went to the
front, drove clear, dueled down the final stretch, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. SIMPLE SUNDAY unhurried in the early part, had an
outside trip, made a late gain and was a clear third. CUSTOM MADE lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no real factor. MISS SVENGAIL
raced within contention, saved ground around the second turn and weakened. BABY LOCKOUT lacked early speed, came around the final turn wide,
improved position, but was no factor. HALF A BELL pressed the early pace and faded. BRENDA'S DOLL always raced near the back and was outrun.
BELINDA raced in the middle of the field and retreated. THAT IS AWESOME pressed the early pace and dropped back.
