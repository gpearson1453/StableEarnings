Footnotes
QUICK INTRO dueled for the early lead and made a three wide bid to draw clear on the turn, then dug in gamely in the furlong grounds to turn back the bid
from THE RED WRAITH and edge clear under a drive. THE RED WRAITH was off a step slow, then settled on the inside early, made a inside bid leaving
the quarter pole to loom boldly by the furlong marker but was outfinished late. CALLE DE BOYD chased the early pace and came four wide into the drive
but lacked the needed stretch bid, bested rest. FIFTY TWO PICKUP was reserved early while four wide, came five wide into the drive and had no rally.
SANDY KISS was outrun early and was three wide on the turn and lacked a rally. JUMP BACK JACK dueled for the early lead with the winner on the inside
and faltered.

Footnotes
ATLANTIC PRINCESS was well rated early while two wide, then shifted to the inside leaving the quarter pole to be on the inside leaving the turn, then
tipped out three wide for aim on the front runner, made a bid and responded well to right handed crop urging to draw off in the final furlong to prove much
the best. PROBABLY GRACE vied for the early lead and made a three wide bid on the turn to be clear by the quarter pole, remained clear by the furlong
marker but could not go with the winner in the final sixteenth while staying on to be clearly second best. BABY BEE MERRY vied for the early lead on the
inside, then chased the pace on the turn, shifted out three wide leaving the turn and then came again for the show award. CELESTIAL ORB chased the
early pace four wide and came six wide into the lane but came up empty late. SUSIKIN stumbled at the start, then stalked the pace four to five wide and
weakened. THE OTHER CAT vied for the lead in between rivals and weakened.

Footnotes
AMERICAN EMPRESS set a pressured pace early while in the three path, then shook clear on the backstretch, drew off on the far turn, then held sway late
to prove best under a drive. UPPER SPEED DS was bumped at the start, then settled early, made a four wide move on the far turn to move into contention,
then lugged in through the stretch under steady right handed crop urging, gaining but needed more. MERICATHEBEAUTIFUL was settled back early,
advanced four wide on the turn and showed some late interest to be clearly best of the rest. PHONE A FRIEND pressed the winner early four wide, then
chased that rival three wide on the far turn and weakened. MAY BEAU was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the drive and had no rally. LYING
KAREN passed the tiring rivals. LYLA'S MARK chased the early pace two wide and tired. CASARENA HOTTIE pressed the early pace on the inside and
stopped.

Footnotes
PANADERO was reserved early, then dropped to the inside around the three eighths marker, then eased off the inside and came five wide into the drive,
closed well on the outsider to get up under a drive. KISS PRINCIPAL was rated along the inside on the first turn, then shifted off the rail to move around
tiring rivals on the turn, then shifted out in the stretch to close well to just miss. PHARAOH'S PROPHECY was settled early towards the inside, came four
wide into the drive and rallied well but was outfinished. PAPI BELLO was reserved early and then made a four wide move on the turn to take over leaving
the quarter pole and shake clear by the furlong marker but proved to be not enough, faded late. GREAT BRITAIN was rated along early three to four wide,
made a bid on the far turn to vie for command then weakened. MEROKEE stalked the pace three wide and weakened. ITS OVER set the early pace on the
inside and gave way. ANGELUS DIAMOND chased the pace from between horses on the first turn and tired.

EMMANUEL set a pressured pace early in the three path, then went on to set the pace while clear, was well handled and when asked responded well to
draew out in the final furlong to prove much the best. GLIDER was rated along early, made a inside bid leaving the turn but proved to be no match for the
winner while clearly second best. IN THE UNION was settled early while three wide, made a four wide bid on the far turn but weakened in the drive, bested
rest. BOITANO stalked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the far turn but then was empty. CLOUD PLAY was a bit rank into the first turn,
pressed the early pace on the inside and then tired. AGENT COOPER was not a factor.

SIP'N DIP was allowed to settle early, made a four wide bid leaving the far turn, drew clear by the sixteenth pole and then held off MUSETTA late to prove
best under a drive. MUSETTA was reserved early towards the inside, then eased out on the turn and advanced three to four wide on the turn, closed the
gap well late but could not get tot the winner. NANCY WORK was allowed to settle early towards the inside, then steadied nearing the five sixteenths pole,
shifted out and came four wide into the drive and was along for the show award. PLATINUMCENTS set the pace from the inside and was headed by the
three sixteenths and weakened. KISSMELIPS stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to be just off the pace but weakened. TAKE ME
AS I AM was reserved while three to four wide but had no rally. DR KAAK failed to respond. WHISTLER DIXIE was four wide into the first turn, then chased
the pace and moved to the inside on the far turn and weakened. BEAUTIFUL TIZ was not a factor. TEGLA showed little.
