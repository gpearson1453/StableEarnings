Footnotes
BERNALINHO stumbled at the start and quickly recovered to sit just off of the pace while outside of rivals, improved position on the second turn while three
wide, continued that run into the stretch while six wide, overtook SEAHAWK CODY nearing the sixteenth marker and kicked clear in the end. SEAHAWK
CODY was sent leaving the break to set the moderate fractions while being pressed through the backstretch run,was confronted nearing the quarter-marker
by SLEEP OVER, shook free of that foe inside of the final sixteenth but could not hold off the winner in the late going and kept on for the place. SLEEP
OVER pressed the pace through the second turn, battled against SEAHAWK CODY inside of the furlong marker but could not keep pace in the late stages
and was outfinished, while holding for third. COLLUSION DELUSION was allowed to settle through the early going, mounted a four wide rally on the second
turn and continued that run into the stretch and was gaining on the third-place rival in the end but could not reel him in. BY MOONLIGHT stalked the pace
inside of rivals and lacked a late response in the stretch run. WILD WAGER was unhurried through the backstretch run while saving ground and did not rally
in the stretch drive.

CONTINENTAL UNION was away fast and showed good speed into the turn while being pressed, shook free of that pressing rival into the stretch and
pulled away under urging in the late stages. HARDY CHISEL saved ground while stalking the pace into the turn, tipped out leaving the bend, dueled with
CAJUN BETTOR for place honors through the lane and dug in to claim second. CAJUN BETTOR chased from the rear of the field while saving ground,
swung widest into the stretch, dueled with HARDY CHISEL through the final sixteenth for second and was nipped on the line while clear of the rest. SMOKE
AND BURN chased the pace from the two path through the turn and weakened in the stretch run. KLAY NATION was hustled to press the fractions into the
turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
THIS IS THE ONE stalked the pace into the turn from a three wide position, angled out for the drive, had a late kick in the final sixteenth and was up in time
to prevail. SHOUT IT OUT chased the pace from an inside position on the turn, improved position in the stretch while along the rail and continued that run in
the final stages to vie for the lead late but held second in the end. ALL MY HOPE was away in good order and set the pace while being pressured, gained a
bit of ground leaving the turn, was caught nearing the sixteenth marker and was outfinished, just missing for second. GOOD TIME DOLLY chased the early
pace from the rear while outside of rivals, was five wide on the turn and mounted a late rally in the stretch, though not able to reel in the top trio. SEGURO
pressed the fractions from a two wide path, lost a bit of ground leaving the turn and gave way in the stretch drive. ST. ANNIE'S INDY chased the pace from
a four wide path on the turn and tired in the stretch.

ROBS LUCKY SPIRIT stalked the pace from a two wide path through the second turn, swung out for the drive, wore down the leading pair inside of the
furlong marker and held in a drive over the oncoming runner-up. KATZUMOTO tracked the pace from the midflight while outside of rivals, mounted a steady
bid along the second turn while three wide, continued that run into the stretch and closed well to pressure the winner but could not reel him in while besting
the rest. INVERTIGO hopped at the start and settled off of the pace while outside of rivals, angled in to save ground on the second turn, improved position
nearing the quarter-marker, lacked room inside of the furlong marker and closed well in the late going to claim third. CLARENCE HEADS pressed the quick
fractions through the second turn, was still up close leaving the second turn and gave way in the late stages. ALLEYCAT was unhurried while saving ground
through the second turn and was improved position in the final furlong. EARNEST was hustled leaving the break and set quick fractions while being
pressured through the second turn, led into the stretch run but was caught by the winner inside of the furlong marker and tired in the late going. CURRY
NATION lost ground along the first turn and lagged through the second turn run, rallied in the stretch but to no avail.

inside of the furlong marker and kicked clear in the end. RUNNING LUCK stalked the pace from the second flight while saving ground, gained ground into
the stretch and vied for the lead inside of the furlong marker but was outkicked in the drive while getting the nod for second. FRONT OF LINE (GB) was
forwardly placed while stalking the pace into the second turn, vied for the lead among a host of rivals inside of the last furlong and was outfinished in the
drive, just missing for second. HARBOR ABBEY saved ground while settling off of the early pace, improved position while angling out in the drive but
flattened in the final furlong. RIVIERA SUNRISE stalked the quick pace from a two wide path through the second turn, vied for the lead inside of the eighth
pole and gave way in the drive. SHE'S EXPENSIVE was a bit rank and hard to place while four wide on the first turn, continued that wide trip into the
second turn and did not mount a late rally. TENDERONI was sent leaving the break to set quick fractions while extending the lead through the first half-mile,

LYING GHOST was away alertly and was sent to set the early fractions while three wide on the first turn, slipped over to the two path for the run along the
backstretch and into the second turn, shook free of a pressing rival and had a clear lead into the lane, was challenged in the final stages and held on over
oncoming rivals. UNUSUAL CODE saved ground while unhurried through the backstretch run, was steered out along the second turn and mounted a four
wide rally into the stretch, was urged on under left-handed encouragement and closed well to just miss for the win, while holding for second. DOUBLE THE
GOLD was a bit rank on the first turn while steadying off of heels, settled along the backstretch run while outside of rivals, improved position while three
wide on the second turn and was outclosed in the drive, while well clear of the rest. RUNNING ON EMPTY stalked the pace outside of rivals in the early
going, angled in along the second turn, gave ground into the stretch run and weakened in the late stages. HANDS OFF stalked the pace along the first turn,
pressed the leader into the second turn while saving ground, lost position into the stretch and gave way in the late going. SUMMANUS saved ground while
stalking the pace into the second turn, dropped back along the bend and faded in the stretch run.

AUTISM BLUE was away alertly and was sent to set the pace from an inside position, felt pressure nearing the quarter-marker, was able to shake free but
was pressured again in the final sixteenth by CHUMLY and held on in the final strides to prevail. CHUMLY tracked the pace outside of foes, gained ground
to pressure AUTISM BLUE nearing the quarter-pole, lost a bit of ground to that foe into the stretch but closed well in the final sixteenth to again pressure the
winner but could not reel him in while besting the rest. MALIBU GHOST was forwardly placed while stalking the pace along the turn, improved position while
two wide between rivals nearing the quarter-marker, lost ground leaving the turn and was outfinished while on the left lead in the stretch. PRINCE
CINDERELLA chased the pace from a two wide path along the turn and weakened in the stretch drive. TOMMY SPECIAL was unprepared at the start and
was away slowly, was outrun to the turn and had no late response.

Footnotes
DONCIC pressed the pace into the turn while outside of rivals, wore down the pacesetter leaving the turn and edged clear in the end. GATOR SHINING
stalked the pace in tight quarters into the turn, continued to be in traffic along the turn, looked for room nearing the top of the stretch and closed along the
inside to claim second in the late stages. TIZ VICIOUS chased the leaders while outside of rivals on the turn and did not have a final kick in the stretch run,
but did save the show. REFI NOW had no early speed, improved position along the turn while three wide and closed willingly in the lane to just miss for
third. EVENEREVENWORSE was bumped at the start and recovered to set the quick fractions through the turn while two wide, came under pressure by
DONCIC nearing the quarter-marker, ceded the lead to the winner inside of the furlong marker and weakened in the late going. STRUT TO THE WIRE
broke in at the start and bumped EVENEREVENWORSE, chased the pace into the turn, took up sharply and dropped back leaving the three-furlong marker
and was empty in the stretch run.

Footnotes
MURPHYS TIGER pressed the quick fractions outside of GREAT STORY along the turn, wore that foe down nearing the furlong marker and kicked clear in
the end. GREAT STORY was away well and showed speed while setting quick fractions through the turn, could not hold off MURPHYS TIGER leaving the
turn but kept on in the stretch to best the rest. SAINT GREY chased the quick pace from a two wide path on the turn and was outfinished in the drive. EL
TENAMPA chased the pace from the rear while three wide and weakened in the stretch run. MAGICISTHEMOONLITE broke in the air and was away
slowly, chased the pace outside of foes on the turn and did not have a late response. VANDENBERG saved ground while stalking the pace through the turn
and tired in the stretch drive.
