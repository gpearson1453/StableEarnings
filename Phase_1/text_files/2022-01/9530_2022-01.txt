Footnotes
SAY HEY KID with the second flight, shifted four wide entering the stretch, rallied to make the lead past the furlong marker and finished full of run to win
going away. ROSE'S GALAXY pressed the pace three wide into the far turn, gained a narrow lead, set the pace until deep stretch then was no match for the
winner. HERO OF THE HOUR with the second flight three wide, went evenly in the five path through the stretch. THE WAYNE FACTOR pressed the pace
two wide into the far turn, matched strides until deep stretch then faded. PORT HUNTER failed to menace. PONT DU GARD had speed for a half then
weakened. KLAATU was hustled along to set a pressured pace along the inside into the far turn, had speed into the stretch then was used up.

Footnotes
JAIL HOUSE CODE matched strides for the lead two wide into the turn, gained the advantage, set the balance of the pace and finished full of run under
brisk handling to win as much the best. SHE'S PURE SILVER close up, loomed boldly four wide through the turn then was no match for the winner. JOYA
BRILLANTE stalked the pace and finished evenly in the four path. BEAV'S BOO unhurried early, swung wide and had a mild late rally mid track. MY
GLORY closed some ground late in the eight path. SHEISTHEHERO with the second flight inside, lacked the needed response. SWEET QUEEN BEE failed
to menace. LA CAFETERA moved up along the inside into the turn then came up empty. SUM KINDA PRETTY was no factor. SKY was outrun. LUCKY
TUESDAY rushed up the inside to make the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the turn then stopped in the stretch. CEVICHE was through
early.

Footnotes
SARATOGA STYLE stalked the pace into the stretch, responded readily three wide to make the lead past the furlong marker and drew off under strong
handling. WOLF EYES pressed the pace two wide and finished clear for second. NO QUESTION rushed to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured
pace along the rail until deep stretch then weakened. SHYLA went evenly. BEST OF YOU failed to menace. MANHATTAN LADY was outrun.
SWEETALKINGJUSTICE stumbled at the start and was no factor.
