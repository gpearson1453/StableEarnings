Footnotes
MAGIC MULE stalked the pace, eased out to the four path leaving the turn, rallied outside horses, drifted in slightly inside the sixteenth pole and was up
late. ROYAL THUNDER set the pace along the inner rail, drifted out a bit inside the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. JOHN THE BEAR , well
positioned three deep around the turn, had aim on the lead in upper stretch, flattened out and was lightly steadied well behind the top pair inside the
sixteenth pole. BUGLE OF WAR , along the inner rail around the turn, eased out to the two path in upper stretch and passed tired horses. MONSTER
MASON , three wide mid way on the turn, lacked a rally. HE'S ORIENTATE chased the pace while two wide, was done on the turn and faded through the
stretch. Objections by the rider of JOHN THE BEAR against MAGIC MULE and ROYAL THUNDER for alleged interference inside the sixteenth pole were
not allowed.

Footnotes
BADGER TOOTH , under a firm hold while saving ground, drafted back off the pace leaving the three quarter pole, crept back up near the half, remained
under patient handling leaving the three eighths, angled out for room near the five sixteenths and shifted six wide into the lane, responded when put to
pressure and rolled up to engage the leaders with a sixteenth to go, took command soon after and widened under steady hand encouragement.
UNCOMMON VALOR rated behind rivals while close up and off the rail mid way through the backstretch, came out wider leaving the far turn, advanced five
wide into the lane, moved up between rivals while on his left lead to threaten inside the furlong grounds then churned on willingly to gain the place. TRIPLE
TITOS was used four wide early to reach contention, disputed the pace the outside BAKENEKO, battled three wide into the lane, held a slim advantage
coming to mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. BAKENEKO had speed to garner to the early lead, was joined then headed into the backstretch, held
position and contested the pace to the inside of TRIPLE TITOS for and extended period, raced two wide and continued the fight past mid stretch then
weakened late. NARMER broke a step slow, moved up wide early then settled in a tracking spot three to four wide, was under asking trying to keep pace
past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on in upper stretch and weakened. ANTIPOISON stalked the pace off the inside, chased inside runners leaving the five
sixteenths then tired.

Footnotes
BEVERLY PARK was nudged up to the inside of rivals and put a head in front after a sixteenth of a mile, took some outside pressure before going clear
nearing the turn, quickly widened past the three eighths while under some rating and off the inside, kept on under strong handling past mid stretch then was
minimally ridden through the final seventy yards. KINGSTON PIKE , off slow and bumped, regrouped and edged up to the inside of foes, remained towards
the inside into the stretch and closed willingly to gain the place. SNEAKINESS disputed the early pace outside the winner, saw that one go clear with a half
mile to go, was under strong asking pursuing mid turn, raced four wide into the lane and stayed on well. AMEN CORNER , three wide near the half mile
marker, shifted five wide with some headway near the quarter pole, straightened away and kept on with interest. MYSTIC TIMES lagged four to five wide
and failed to generate a solid run. TOP BOSS , fractious in the gate, gave early chase, raced six wide into the lane and came up empty.
GRUMPELSTILTSKIN came in at the break and bumped with a rival, failed to keep pace, raced towards the inside in upper stretch and faded.

FIX ME A SANDWICH bobbled inward and was away last, corrected and accelerated inside rivals to go clear near the five eighths, set the pace under some
rating around the turn, responded when set down three wide in upper stretch, kept on under a drive past mid stretch then was solidly hand ridden the final
sixteenth while holding firm. COMMANDING GENERAL , taken to rate while saving some ground, advanced to the inside of a rival nearing the quarter pole,
eased out to have aim on the winner, failed to seriously threaten but held well through the lane. COMBINATION , off the pace, raced three wide into the
lane, shifted out and kept on willingly. FAST CASH lagged off the pace while outside a rival, circled five wide into the stretch, dropped in for the final furlong
but lacked a solid kick. BIG TALL DAWG had speed and chased the winner while off the rail, stayed on to upper stretch then faded. SUBJECT TO CHANGE
lacked speed, raced three wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
FROST POINT , off the pace while saving some ground, was put to urging near the half mile marker, gathered some momentum and eased out past the five
sixteenths, knifed her way between rivals then angled out to quickly gain into the stretch, straightened to be about four wide, kicked clear under solid asking
in mid stretch, eagerly widened soon after then was confidently handled through the final seventy yards. PETTIGO GIRL , off the pace while saving some
ground early on, was fanned five wide when making some progress into the stretch, regrouped and churned on willingly to nab the place. AWARD WANTED
, three wide to contention, tracked in hand, bid outside the leader near the half mile marker, sparred to the five sixteenths, shook clear approaching the
stretch, was overwhelmed by the winner near the three sixteenths, gave way grudgingly in the final furlong and lost the place late. RUNAWAY MONET rated
off the pace and off the inside, shifted out and came six wide for the drive, chased but came up empty in the final eighth. NANA'S SHOES dropped in early
and lagged back, came off the inside for the drive and offered a belated response. ACADIAN GIRL vied four wide outside rivals then went clear near the
seven eighths, dropped in to set the pace, was joined with a half mile remaining, sparred to the inside of AWARD WANTED to the five sixteenths then gave
way in upper stretch. HOT CHOICE angled in early, settled off the pace and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
JACK GAVE BACK lacked speed, found ample room along the inner rail through the stretch, swept to command inside the eighth pole then drew off.
SPEIGHTSTER RED gained a clear lead leaving the backstretch, raced along the inner rail around the far turn, drifted out turning for home and tired in the
drive. ICE RAIN , up close down the backstretch, challenged for the lead in the two path between horses midway on the turn and gave way approaching the
eighth pole. IRON PEARLS showed speed along the inner rail, gave way on the far turn and unseated his rider when ducking out to avoid a fallen horse in
upper stretch and walked off. KING ALAN stalked the pace, advanced three deep on the far turn to reach contention, tired, stumbled and fell in upper stretch
and walked off. GOLDIE'S BOY unseated his rider when stumbling leaving the starting gate and walked off. All three unseated riders appeared to be okay
and all three horses walked off. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the start and the incidents in upper stretch but no action was taken.
