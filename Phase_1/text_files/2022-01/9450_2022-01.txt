BISTRAYA went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and finished well. HIGH POWERED pressed the pace, made a bid around the final turn, proved no
match for the winner, but was best of others. INVASORS WIND raced within striking distance, made a mild bid and proved no match for the top two.
BUXTERHOOTER void of early speed, saved ground around the final turn, improved position, but was no factor. CHAOSMOS always raced near the back,
had an outside trip and was never a threat. DEALIN' STELEN lacked early speed and showed little. EPIC (ARG) pressed the early pace, saved ground
around the final turn and dropped back.

NATE'S REVENGE raced in the middle of the pack, saved ground around the second turn, made a rail bid and proved the best late. DREAMER'S DELIGHT
lacked early speed, made a late bid and was a clear second at the wire. AS THUNDER HEART vied for the early lead, drove clear and lacked a late kick.
ORPHAN CREEK raced within contention, made a bid, weakened and was no threat late. LUCK OF THE STARS bumped at the start, raced in the back and
was never a factor. CABRO TORO broke in, bumped rival, raced in the rear, came around the second turn wide and showed little. SPIN TOWN showed
early speed, dropped back and trailed the field.

turn wide, made a late bid, seven wide and was outfinished. C C'S BABY GIRL raced in the middle of the field, made a late bid, six wide, was outfinished,
while putting forth a game effort. FRIENDLY AND KIND showed early speed, forwardly placed throughout, took the lead down the home stretch and hung
late. MOORAC raced within contention, came around the final turn wide and weakened. FLAT OUT BIG MONEY dueled on the front end, saved ground and
faded. DIAL EM IN raced evenly near the back, saved ground around the second turn and was never a factor. OH MY OH challenged for the early
advantage and was finished early. HURRICANE TIZWAY broke poorly, raced near the back, came around the first turn wide and was never a threat.

PIONEER PRIDE vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and drove clear before the wire. DIABLO CAT challenged for the early advantage,
dueled on the front end throughout, proved no match for the winner late, but held on for second. MR. CURLIN void of early speed, entered the stretch wide,
rallied, finished willingly and just missed for second. GIMMEASOUND raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid, but was no real factor. BEAUTY BOY
lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly. I'M A SPECIAL STAR challenged on the front end and was finished early. LITTLE
CAN vied for the early lead and made a steady retreat. BIG BAND'S LUCK always raced near the back and was outrun.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT REVOLT pressed the pace, raced outside around the second turn, made a bid and proved the best late. TURN ON THE MAGIC bumped at the
start, vied for the early lead, drove clear, but was no match late for the winner. SUCH broke out, bumped rival, raced within contention and was a clear third
at the wire. WAR ROGUE went to the front, saved ground around the final turn and weakened. MY CALL raced near the middle of the field and put forth an
even effort. POPPI IS SMILING lacked early speed and raced evenly near the back. ICE CRUSH void of early speed, lost contact and was eased to the
wire. OCTOBER SURPRISE always raced near the back, came around the first turn wide, lost contact and was eased to the wire. END ZONE challenged
for the early lead, dropped back and was pulled up down the home stretch and walked off.

early lead, saved ground around the turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. UNTAMED MONEY challenged on the front end,
forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late kick. LA DANTA pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn, weakened and finished evenly.
