the pace, made a five wide run on the turn, rallied steadily outside and got up for second. KNOCK OUT KID tracked on the inside, chased on the turn, rallied
into the stretch, dug in gamely and lost second at the wire. JANELLE DREAMS raced off the pace, saved ground on the turn, closed belatedly outside and
got up fourth. WEST HORIZEN raced off the pace, saved ground on the turn and lacked a rally. TRUE UPGRADE raced off the pace, advanced inside on
the turn and flattened out. MAD MARY stalked between rivals, then chased and tired. ROCHELA dueled two wide, then chased and gave way. WOMAN
FLYER chased three wide and gave way.

SCARAMOUCHE led inside for half a mile, lost the lead outside at the quarter pole then resurged and drew away driving. CODIGO dropped well behind,
advanced boldly inside on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. TWISTED RIDE acted up in the gate briefly before the start, dropped back then offered a
strong late. SECRET ALLIANCE pressed the winner in the two path for half a mile and weakened. FLACO EXPLOSIVO made a strong move along the
inside on the turn, led briefly at the quarter pole but weakened. HOTPOT lagged far behind then passed fading opponents. BE THE BOSS prompted the
pace three wide to the turn and stopped. MAGICAL KNIGHT was urged close up four wide down the backstretch, stopped and was eased late.

Footnotes
SOLID GOLD DANCER raced off the pace inside, tracked the leaders on the backside, made a rail bid on the far turn, dueled with HAY BUCK, took over
and drew clear under urging. HAY BUCK was bumped at the start, set the pace racing a bit off the inside, showed the way into the far turn, dueled with the
winner passing the quarter pole, was no match and well clear for the place spot. SAIL ABOVE tracked early on along the inside, stalked on the backside, bid
three wide on the far turn, could not go with the top pair, then bested the others for third. TOMARIE raced five wide early, then stalked three wide, chased
on the far turn and tired. AKNA was reluctant to load, then steadied at the start, was in tight and checked entering the first turn, trailed the field, moved up
inside on the far turn, then flattened out. LULA'S ROADRUNNER raced six wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace, went four wide on the far turn and
failed to threaten. EXCITABLE LADY was bumped at the start, stalked two wide and faded.

STAR LUCK reserved inside the pacesetters, angled out on the turn, led in the stretch and just lasted. THE WANT OF A NAIL broke slowly, rushed up wide
and made a gradual late gain to just miss. GILDED WARRIOR chased wide throughout and closed well to earn the show. ROCKIN COWBOY alternated for
the lead inside and tired in the final furlong. SIX CIDER raced wide early, angled inside on the turn and faded. JERSEY JOE B vied for the advantage
outside then proved empty in the stretch. KOWBOY KARMA lagged far behind then caught rivals without menacing. ASK CHUCK dropped well behind
inside and was never in contention. THOMAS KNIGHT saved ground off the leaders and weakened steadily. DRAMATIZED dropped back after the start
and was always far behind.

Footnotes
TIO WIL was bumped at the start, stalked the leaders, waited for room while saving ground on the turn, slipped through on the rail approaching the quarter
pole, took over, drew clear and held well under urging in deep stretch. LAWN BOY (GB) was off a bit slow, raced off the pace, moved up inside on the turn,
rallied inside and dug in gamely on the rail in the final sixteenth. MACH TRIAL chased inside in the early stages, moved up three wide on the turn and rallied
mildly inside in the lane. LOVERBOY LOU was bumped and squeezed at the start, raced three wide off the pace and closed belatedly outside. NO
FOOLING DUDE set the pace on the inside, dueled on the turn and weakened. MANOLETE was bumped at the start, trailed the field and did not factor.
HARD WEST chased close up outside early on, bid three wide on the turn, dueled and tired. MOON PISTOL bobbled at the break, raced two wide off the
pace, chased on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
MR. PETE settled off the leaders in the two path, advanced in the stretch and was up in the late yards after a long drive. TUDOX EXPECTATIONS dropped
back early outside then split rivals in the stretch with late energy. TOWN JAK was in tight early, advanced inside on the turn and battled to the finish.
JW'STRICKYMISCHIEF rushed to the front inside, was collared into the stretch and held on gamely. EGO MAN squeezed back just after the start, raced
very wide and closed well. FEDERAL CASE came out at the start, chased outside early then inside on the turn and was no threat. HIGH VELOCITY
prompted the pace outside for half a mile and weakened. GRAVEL ROAD flashed speed outside down the backstretch then stopped abruptly. Claims of foul
by the rider of EGO MAN against the second and third place finishers for interference at the start were dismissed.

Footnotes
THE BIGGEST ONE quickly took control, widened into the stretch while drifting out and was kept to her task. LADY MISTRESS far behind early, advanced
inside to be easily second best. PRETTY SPECTACULAR dropped back early then gained in the two path while no menace. ROO LA LA trailed early, raced
wide with some late energy. BROAD JUMPER lacked speed, raced very wide and was no factor. DIAL A LADY went after the winner on the turn then
flattened out. BOHEMIA BABE moved briefly closer inside on the turn then faltered through the stretch. CAPE COD SALLY prompted the pace briefly then
gave way readily. LA PANZANELLA forced the pace wide for half a mile and stopped. ANGELSFOUR MICHELE tried to bear out on the turn and was
difficult to handle while fading.
