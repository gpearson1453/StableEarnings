Footnotes
CHRISTINE'S JACK broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside with OUT FOR JUSTICE, disposed of that rival after going three-quarters, opened a
clear lead and held off the closing MORE HONOR to prevail. MORE HONOR was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second
turn and was gaining steadily on the winner late. PASSED BY PAUL settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and lacked the needed closing
response. THE PUBLIC HALO chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. SPARKLING LUTE was void of early foot,
raced six-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. DYF was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn and did
not offer a bid. OUT FOR JUSTICE was away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.

COASTLINE SERMON was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn, responded to steady urging and was up in the closing yards.
KENZOU'S RHYTHM was never far back, raced four-wide through the turn, reached the fore nearing the sixteenth pole but could not match strides with the
winner late. BLANK IT was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive furlong. PRIVATE JOKE lacked early
foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and did not threaten. FLYCATCHER broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside
and gave way through the final furlong. LINEMANS CHECK settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. WORKING
showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ARDENLEE STAR was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the
turn and did not menace. SILVER SERVICE disputed the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going three furlongs.

Footnotes
AUDACE lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, responded when set down for the drive, reached the fore in the final yards and quickly drew
off. MARCH ON LINCH settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn, reached the leaders nearing the quarter but could not match strides
with the winner late. STRETFORD END disputed the pace while racing five-wide and gave way late. HERZEN showed no early speed, lacked racing room
nearing the quarter and finished with good energy when clear. COLORADO CANDY dueled for the lead while racing three-wide from between foes and
gave way in the drive. HOLLYWOOD AS USUAL pressed the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. A GEM IS A GEM disputed the
pace from between foes and weakened after going a half. DON WITH THE WIND was away in good order then lacked early speed, raced four-wide through
the turn and was not a factor. THOUGHTS OF GOLD pressed the pace from the inside and weakened after going three furlongs.
