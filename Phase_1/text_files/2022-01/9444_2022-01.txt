Footnotes
DON'T QUOTE ME bumped with BOURBON OVER ICE at the start, recovered and secured a good spot tracking the early three-way battle up front, shifted
to the four-path being roused late on the turn, rallied steadily outside and drew clear late. PACO'S PICO was backed out and reloaded after becoming
fractious in the gate, broke without incident and vied early outside EYES OF A CHAMPION and BOURBON OVER ICE, got the best of the latter entering
the final furlong, could not hold off the winner and just saved the place. LABAN M MO broke in brushing into DON'T QUOTE ME, then steadied back behind
CHAMP DUBAI at a cost of several lengths, shifted off the inside to the three-path on the turn, and finished willingly between horses. EYES OF CHAMPION
vied early inside BOURBON OVER ICE and PACO'S PICO, and could not keep pace by midway on the turn. BOURBON OVER ICE bumped with DON'T
QUOTE ME at the start, led with pressure from both sides into the turn, stayed on just inside PACO'S PICO to upper stretch, then gave way late. WIZARD
SERRAT raced wide and dropped back steadily after a quarter-mile. CHAMP DUBAI became edgy in the gate after eyeing the antics of PACO'S PICO, then
showed little during the running despite being urged along.

Footnotes
HEALING was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced two wide around the first turn, was well rated outside up the backstretch, moved up three wide to
challenge for the lead entering the far turn, dueled three deep into the stretch run, shook off inside foe and stayed on with ALADON, dug in gamely from the
outside and prevailed under a driving finish. ALADO was off a step slow at the start then quickly advanced to apply pressure to the early leader, continued to
force the issue up the backstretch, roused forward to challenge NEVERSTOPDREAMING entering the far turn, dueled between rivals into the upper stretch,
fought back gamely inside of HEALING and got denied late. NEVERSTOPDREAMING held a slim lead around the first turn, set a pressured pace up the
backstretch, dueled for the lead around the far turn, fought back into the upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong and just lasted for show. EMOJI GUY
raced inside in range through early stages, hustled up two wide through the far turn, stayed on three wide into the upper stretch, ran on evenly and got
nipped for show. POUND GREEN stalked three wide through the early going, hustled up for around the far turn, came four wide into the lane, sustained a
even bid and got edged for show.

Footnotes
BOHEMIAN BOY took control after an alert getaway, ambled along through a measured pace inside, and responded through the stretch to keep PREFECT
at bay. PREFECT brushed with MEYER as their feet got tangled together a stride from the gate, moved off the inside early, was coaxed along four wide
approaching the stretch, had a clear shot outside BOHEMIAN BOY through the lane and was gaining gradually at the finish. SKI PATROL prompted
BOHEMIAN BOY from outside, could not seriously menace into the lane, shifted inward and was one-paced inside the top two to the wire. MEYER got
tangled up with PREFECT out of the gate and stumbled, saved ground unable to reach contention, and returned with a gash on his left front hoof. STEAK
AND CHEESE raced in the clear three wide to the stretch, and faded.

Footnotes
WAR OF AGES hustled along in pursuit of the early leader, moved up to challenge UNCONCIOUS late on the turn, vied turning for home, seized command
near mid-stretch and finished going away. MOCLIPS steadied not long after the start, raced off the early speed, shifted out moving through the turn, came
five wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and finished on equal terms for place. UNCONSCIOUS sprinted to a clear lead and angled inside soon after
the start, took on the challenge of WAR OF AGES late on the turn, vied into the upper stretch, failed to keep pace with the winner, weakened and finished
on equal terms for place. SPICY HONEY (IRE) raced outside near midpack , roused three wide through the turn, came four wide into the upper stretch,
steadily edged up closer, angled inside late and cleared the rest. CROOKLYN raced off the early pace, came four wide into the lane and passed tiring rivals.
SONGTELLER raced behind WHATS GOIN ON and was forced to check not long after the start, chased in contention two wide around the turn, failed to
keep pace at the head of the lane and gave way. THE CUBAN MISSILE steadied not long after the start, angled inside mid-way through the backstretch,
saved ground through the turn and faded in the lane. MONICA QUEEN raced off the early speed, chased two wide around the turn and had no late
response. BLUEBERRY QUEEN raced off the pace and saved ground to no avail. LUNA CIAO was slow into stride at the start and trailed throughout.
WHATS GOIN ON was forwardly placed out of the gate, shied and ducked outward not long after the start, lost the rider, ran loose during the race, then
corralled by the outriders and walked off.

CRUMB BUN pressed the pace three wide, took the lead leaving the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. HAPPY CONSTITUTION stalked the
pace from the rail, cut the corner into the lane, took the lead nearing the eighth pole, was collared leaving the sixteenth marker and fought on inside of the
winner while drifting slightly late. FIRE ON TIME bobbled at the break, set the pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired.
HALLAWALLAH hopped at the start, raced off the pace four wide and never threatened. COREY settled off the early pace, advanced four wide around the
turn, bid nearing the lane but came up empty. GRAN BABY (CHI) was through early and was eased.

Footnotes
MAKE NO MISTAKE advanced inside around the far turn, waited briefly for room approaching the top of the stretch before finding a seam in the two-path,
overpowered CARIBBEAN KITTEN from outside coming to the furlong grounds and drew off under a mild drive. GENERIC MARK raced three wide on the
turns in the second flight, came out wider into the stretch and rallied mildly without menacing the winner. CARIBBEAN KITTEN contested the pace outside
ALL ABOUT KATHERN on the first turn, cleared off and moved inside up the backstretch, could not hold off MAKE NO MISTAKE in upper stretch and
weakened. AFFICIONADO (FR) stayed in range early, loomed a threat four wide with a quarter-mile remaining, but flattened out in the stretch. FANTASTIC
KINGDOM was strung out four wide on the first turn, settled in midpack three wide through the middle stages, and lacked the needed response.
MAGICGIRL was finished early inside. SHE'S HOT TODAY broke behind the field, and lagged far back throughout.. ALL ABOUT KATHERN led early inside
before yielding to CARIBBEAN KITTEN, chased outside the latter to the end of the far turn, and had nothing left. YES I'M EVIL spotted the field a couple
lengths at the start, never reached contention, and was vanned off after the finish.

Footnotes
ORIENTAL TRIGGER (ARG) tracked the pace between foes up the backstretch, was ridden along two wide in a bit tight late on the turn, given cue three
wide approaching the upper stretch, took over the lead from CREATE AGAIN at the furlong marker and widened advantage under steady pressure.
LUDINGTON was away in good order and angled inside soon after the start, stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, sat patiently inside around the turn,
went to make a move along the rail in upper stretch, got denied access, steadied and lost some momentum, regrouped and came on late to capture place.
CREATE AGAIN sped to the lead and angled inside in opening stages, set the pace up the backstretch, held firm around the turn, came two wide into the
upper stretch, angled inside under right handed pressure, got collared by ORIENTAL TRIGGER at the furlong marker, stayed on and got edged late for
place. DRIVE FOR FUN stalked the pace through early stages, roused three wide around the turn, sustained a steady bid into the lane and lacked the
needed response for serious impact. DISC JOCKEY broke in and bumped with rival at the start, raced off the top flight up the backstretch, hustled up
around the turn, came two wide into the upper stretch and and had a mild improve. LITTLE DEMON bumped with rival at the start, raced off the second
flight and saved ground up the backstretch, was ridden inside into stretch run and lacked a needed rally. FULL CHARGE tracked the pace in close range up
the backstretch, was ridden along four wide around the turn and weakened turning for home. TAPIT TO THE WIRE raced four wide off the second flight
entering the turn, stayed outside into the stretch run and had no late response. AMOUNT got bumped back at the start, raced in the last flight and failed to
move into close contention.

Footnotes
MEZCAL broke inwardly and bumped SILKY WARRIOR into ENTWINE, set a rated pace along the rail, shrugged off a bid from CHAMPAGNE IVY in upper
stretch and held sway under a drive. CHAMPAGNE IVY prompted the winner two wide around all three turns, switched back to the left near the sixteenth
pole and could not gain. DIVINE EXCHANGE chased the top two while racing two wide around the first two turns, went three wide around the far turn and
lacked the needed rally. ENGLISH BREEZE saved ground in midpack, went three wide around the far turn and never threatened. SILKY WARRIOR (IRE)
was bumped at the start, saved ground and failed to menace. ENTWINE (IRE) was bumped at the start, tracked the pace from the rail and retreated nearing
the lane. ORIGINAL TIMES and RUN-UP REINSTATED UPON REVIEW.

QUALITY CONTROL saved ground unhurried early, advanced out in the five-path after six furlongs, altered course inside the bearing-out pacesetter to take
over into the stretch, outdueled SCHOOL DANCE into the final furlong, then held off a last-ditch rebid from that rival. SCHOOL DANCE broke out into the
hind end of MIA CAMILA, settled within range in midpack for six furlongs, came through an ample opening in the two-path turning for home, got outdueled
into the last eighth of a mile by QUALITY CONTROL, altered course outside the latter and was coming back on at the finish. BARBARA set the pace for six
furlongs in the two-path, bore out badly carrying out MIA CAMILA coming off the far turn, and ran on near the outside rail to hold the show spot. MIA
CAMILA got bumped by SCHOOL DANCE at the start, raced four wide to the far turn, got carried out to near the outside rail by BARBARA at the top of the
stretch, and was cautiously handled near that rival after straightening away. NANA FANNY made no impact in the second flight throughout. PRETTYKEEN
pursued the leaders three to four wide, bid between horses on the far turn, steadied behind BARBARA approaching the stretch, and dropped back.
BOURBON DIVERSION broke slowly, and was outrun four to five wide throughout. OPENTHEGATE stayed near the inside in range for six furlongs, and
came up empty. LITTLE BELITA was forwardly placed for a half-mile, and retreated. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY, BARBARA WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD POSITION AND PLACED FOURTH BEHIND MIA CAMILA FOR INTERFERENCE LEAVING THE FAR TURN AND INTO
THE STRETCH.
