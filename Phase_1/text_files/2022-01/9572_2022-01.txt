Footnotes
RACIN' JACIN never far back, closed rapidly four wide on the turn, made the lead before the quarter pole, was put to a right handed stick and drew clear
late under a strong hand ride. STUNT MAN stalked the pace early, loomed boldly along the rail nearing the quarter pole, kept pressure past the furlong
marker, shifted out to the three path giving up some ground and came on again late. YOU'RE OUT went evenly. QUIMBY failed to menace. DEXQUIRE
dueled for the lead near the inside for a half then weakened. TAMMY'S TOY was no threat. FAST AS FAST CAN B prompted the pace two wide for nearly a
half then stopped.

Footnotes
CURT'S ANGEL made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch then widened at will through the stretch to win going away.
NAITAKA pressured the winner two wide into the stretch then was no match while well clear for second. MY WYNTER ECHO was bumped the in tight
between rivals entering the first turn, vied for the lead near the inside and faded in the stretch. PRINCESS TINE (FR) with the second flight four wide,
dropped back on the second turn. NATALIA'S TEMPLE angled in entering the first turn causing rivals to check and bump, was a forward factor three wide
for a half then gave way. RUNNING ROSADO was in tight entering the clubhouse turn causing her rider to check, offered a mild bid two wide before a half
then came up empty. LYRICIST was forced inward bumping MY WYNTER ECHO entering the first turn then was no factor. THE STEWARDS POSTED
THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
SEMI CHARMED DAY away alertly, set all the pace while under confident handling and widened through the stretch to win as much the best under a strong
hand ride. LIQUID LOUIE chased the winner four then three wide and finished second best in the seven path. MAN DOWN trailed early, moved up outside
before the far turn, swung out to the middle of the racetrack then finished evenly. MUSICAL MAN vied for the lead two wide and faded in the stretch.
DRAMATIC KITTEN well placed, failed to respond. SKYLIME close up, loomed boldly along the rail nearing the half mile marker then came up empty.

Footnotes
SHORE OF EDEN broke in front, set all the pace with a clear lead and maintained her advantage under a strong hand ride. FORTUNATE GINA had speed
from the start, moved up three wide on the turn and finished second best. MY BELLE MICHELLE had a mild late rally. BISCAYNE BAY offered a mild bid
along the rail through the turn then came up empty. MY LITTLE LILY was outrun. SHEZA FINE JUSTICE chased the winner into the turn, stopped entering
the stretch and was eased to the wire.

Footnotes
BOURBONWITHGINGER away alertly, dueled for the lead two wide then along the inside the entire trip and proved best under left handed urging in a game
effort. BRODY'S JESSICA never far back, loomed boldly three wide into the stretch, drew on near even terms for the lead before the furlong marker and
finished second best. RUN KITTY stalked the pace and went evenly. CARLIE Q BLUE passed tiring rivals in the six path. WILDCAT DREAM failed to
menace. NEVER TO MANY HUGS well placed, lacked the needed response. MY D'VALENTINE swung wide and was no threat. JESS FOR KICKS away
alertly, battled along the inside with the winner to the top of the stretch then weakened. LEX K with the second flight two wide, was through after a half.
HARD LIKE HOLLY had brief speed. WAY BALI trailed.
