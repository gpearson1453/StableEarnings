Footnotes
LEMON ZINGER was bumped by NON ESSENTIAL leaving the break and was shuffled back a bit, stalked the pace along the turn while two wide, was
roused into the stretch, split foes nearing the sixteenth-marker and edged clear in the end. NON ESSENTIAL bumped LEMON ZINGER leaving the break
and disputed the early pace to the turn, kept pressure on the pacesetter along the turn, was asked for run nearing the quarter-pole, led into the stretch but
was outkicked in the final stages while holding for second. GALAN GRAY was off a bit slow and was hustled to chase the pace outside of rivals to the turn,
improved position while four wide on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch drive, though well clear of the rest. JUST WATCH ME NOW was away
alertly and was sent to set pressured fractions through the turn, was collared nearing the top of the stretch and tired in the late going. BUBBLES IS ON FIRE
pressed the early pace to the turn and was done after a half-mile.

Footnotes
GRIGORO stalked the pace while outside of rivals to the second turn, gained along the second turn while three wide, mounted a bid leaving the second turn
to catch the pacesetter and drew clear in the final stages. NICOLE GRACE was away a bit slow and settled off of the pace, gained ground from a four wide
position on the second turn, continued that run into the stretch and was no match for the winner in the end but bested the rest. STATEFOREST stumbled at
the start and recovered well to set the pressured early pace, came under pressure leaving the second bend, was caught by the furlong marker and gave
way in the late going. MALIBU JEWEL saved ground while stalking the fractions and weakened in the stretch drive. SIMMER DOWN tracked the early pace,
gained a bit of ground on the pacesetter along the backstretch, chased into the far turn while two wide and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
PERFECT EDITION stumbled leaving the break, recovered to track the pace from a two wide path to the second turn, took command leaving the far turn,
was pressured in the final stages by the oncoming runner-up but held to prevail. SHANGHAI MIST was forwardly placed while outside of rivals through the
backstretch, gained ground while four wide leaving the second turn, closed in the stretch, pressured the winner in the final strides and just missed at the
end, while holding for second. MIA SOLINA saved ground in the early going while stalking the pace, improved position while two wide on the second turn,
continued that run into the stretch and was outclosed by the top pair. QUICK TIME (GB) was three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace outside of rivals
along the backstretch run, was five wide on the second turn and offered a mild late gain in the stretch run. SANDY SUNSHINE saved ground while
unhurried in the early going, was steered to the three path along the second turn, rallied into the stretch but could not close on the leading group. SWEET
MEG tracked the pace while between rivals through the backstretch run, was three wide on the second turn while still between runners, vied for the lead
nearing the three-sixteenths marker and flattened in the late stages. SHARP CURVE was away in good order and set the pace to the second turn, came
under pressure nearing the quarter-marker and gave way in the late going.

KNOWN was allowed to settle while outside of foes through the backstretch run, improved position while four wide on the second turn, took command into
the drive, had a clear lead inside of the final furlong but felt pressure in the late stages and just lasted over the oncoming runner-up. KALINE saved ground
while unhurried through the backstretch run, was two wide on the second turn and lacked room nearing the quarter-marker, swung four wide into the drive,
closed well in the final sixteenth and challenged the winner in the end and just missed while besting the rest. SOUTHEAST ASIA stalked the early pace then
was given rein along the backside to press the pace to the far turn, vied for the lead nearing the quarter-marker but was outkicked by the top pair in the
stretch drive, while well clear of the rest. BARBIERE stumbled a bit at the start and recovered to track the pace from the inside, lost ground on the second
turn and weakened in the stretch run. CANYON CREST stalked the pace off of the rail, lost ground nearing the second turn and faded in the stretch run.
HONG KONG COWBOY was away well and set the pace to the second turn, came under pressure along the backstretch and fended that pressure off to the
quarter-marker, was collared leaving the second turn and gave way in the stretch run.

ROBBER BARON was allowed to settle in the early stages, mounted a three wide bid on the second turn, vied for the lead nearing the furlong grounds,
battled with FULL OF LUCK, was edging clear when altered course and came over a path in mid-stretch and kicked clear in the end. FULL OF LUCK (CHI)
stalked the early pace then was given rein to press the pace into the second turn, caught the pacesetter nearing the quarter-marker, battled against the
winner when that one confronted him nearing the furlong grounds, steadied in mid-stretch when ROBBER BARON came over a path and was outkicked in
the late going, while holding for second. SACRED RIDER saved ground while stalking the pace to the second turn and was outfinished in the stretch drive.
LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) was unprepared at the start and was allowed to settle through the backstretch run, was two wide on the second turn and offered a
mild late gain in the stretch. MANY ROSES was away alertly and was sent to set the pace to the second turn, was pressured along the backstretch and into
the second turn by FULL OF LUCK, ceded the lead to that rival on the far turn and gave way in the late stages.

Footnotes
AUTISM INNOCENCE pressed the pace from a two wide path through the turn, lost a bit of ground to VASCO leaving the turn, was firmly handled in the
final sixteenth and was up in time to prevail. VIVA LA FIESTA stalked the pace to the turn, was asked for run while three wide nearing the quarter-marker,
gained ground on VASCO in the final stages under firm handling and was outclosed by the winner while earning the nod for second. VASCO was away
alertly and set the pace while being pressured, extended the lead leaving the turn and led into the final sixteenth, was drifting a bit in the final sixteenth and
was caught by the top two while well clear of the rest. JUSTHAPPENLIKETHAT was a bit keen and hard to place in the early going, tracked the pace on the
turn while two wide between foes and weakened in the stretch. JOHNEEDWNTHESTREET chased the pace into the turn, was three wide in traffic along the
turn and gave way in the stretch run. GYPSY STREET chased the pace outside of rivals to the turn, lost ground on the bend while four wide and faltered in
the stretch. GETAWAY CHARM was pinched soon after the start and took up to trail the field to the turn, saved ground along the bend and lacked a late
rally. AUNTIE BEV was forwardly placed to the turn while saving ground, lost ground into the stretch and tired in the late going.
