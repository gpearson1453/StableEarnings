Footnotes
EILEEN ALEXANDRA pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, dueled to the wire and prevailed for the win. BOW BOW GIRL raced in the middle of
the field, made a late inside bid and was outfinished. BAR TAP raced near the middle of the pack, made a late bid, racing four wide and couldn't keep up
with the top two. PUYE TIMING vied for the early lead, saved ground around the final turn and weakened. LADY FROSTED raced evenly near the back in
the early part, came around the second turn on the outside, made a mild bid, but was no factor. FOUR PRINCESSES dueled on the front end, saved ground
around the final turn and faded. SHE A HOT MESS lacked early speed, finished wide and was never a threat. KIND WAYS raced within contention, saved
ground around the second turn and dropped back. GEORGIA DAWN void of early speed and showed little.

Footnotes
STREAMER unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the rail around the final turn, rallied down the lane, under strong urging and drove clear. MISS E. FU
pressed the pace, drove clear around the final turn, couldn't hold off the winner late, but was best of others. STORMY SUNRISE raced in the middle of the
field, made a mild bid, while finishing wide, proved no match for the top two, but got up for third. KLASSY POINT dueled on the front end, saved ground and
weakened. TABLE ONE void of early speed, improved position, but was no factor. ROLL ON BABY always raced near the back and showed little. SOCIAL
GALAXY raced near the middle of the pack and faded. INTERATIFWITHLEU challenged for the early advantage and dropped back.
