Footnotes
YAMATO raced two to three wide around the first turn and settled nicely off the early pace, launched a four wide bid entering the upper stretch, gathered
momentum under steady pressure and kicked clear. STRIKE APPEAL raced midpack outside through early stages, roused forward three wide late on the
far turn, dueled for the lead into the final furlong then got outkicked by the winner. AMERICAN NINJA rated off the early pace, took the inside position late
on the far turn, hustled up between foes in the upper stretch, shifted out four wide for a clear path in the final furlong, finished with response and captured
show. STRIKE THE TOP tracked the pace along the outside, roused forward late on the far turn, dueled between rivals into the final furlong, flattened out
late and got edged for show. LAMPLIGHTER JACK set the pace up the backstretch, came under attack at the head of the lane, dueled into the final furlong
then gave way. DILIGENT raced near midpack, was ridden along three wide around the far turn, got in tight and steadied between foes in the upper stretch
and flattened out. SURF AND TURF raced outside off the early pace, swung five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. LIGHT FURY
steadied entering the first turn, stalked up the backstretch, remained in contention around the far turn then tired in the drive. MARISA'S MISSION bumped
with rival at the start, was reserved racing in the back, came three wide into the lane and failed to respond. TOWN CLASSIC was forwardly placed stalking
up the backstretch, came up empty late on the far turn and steadily weakened. AMBASSADOR JIM settled through early stages, failed to advance under

Footnotes
HAPPY BOY ROCKET raced four wide in midpack around the first turn, advanced outside down the backstretch, moved to the front three wide near the
five-sixteenths pole, quickly cleared, angled in in upper stretch and widened under left-handed urging. MONTAUK POINT was in range inside, angled four
wide near the quarter pole and finished willingly to gain the place. COMPLETE AGENDA brushed the starting gate, showed speed five wide around the first
turn, pressed two wide between foes around the far turn, could not keep pace with the winner but stayed on to hold the show. BEYOND BEST bobbled at
the break, advanced inside entering the first turn, dropped back early on the backstretch, angled widest, advanced under urging entering the far turn, made
progress four and five wide around the bend and flattened out a bit in the lane. CONSULATE saved ground and failed to menace. PRACTICAL WAY raced
off the pace two wide, went five wide around the far turn and never threatened. MAKE WAY played no factor while racing three and four wide. TEN EXTRA
set the pace in the two path, was collared near the five-sixteenths pole, tired and was not urged in the final furlong. MAD MOCHA steadied along around the
first turn, raced three wide and made little impact. ISTHMIAN was in range three wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
TRAFFIC SONG grabbed the lead after an alert break, showed the way inside to the stretch, drifted out and remained clear under pressure. STAR
SEEKING (IRE) went along alone in third up the backstretch and into the far turn, tipped out to the three-path into the stretch, and was up outside
CHAMPAGNE LADY for second near the finish. CHAMPAGNE LADY pursued TRAFFIC SONG from outside throughout, could not reach that one and was
nipped late for the runner-up spot. FINAL BELLE raced in and around the two-path on the turns, and turned in an even effort. KATE'S KINGDOM raced well
back near the inside to the far turn, was briefly held up behind horses at that point, shifted out four wide to the stretch and improved position without
factoring. GLADYS raced three wide to the far turn, moved in a path at the top of the lane, and made no headway. PASSION PLUS was outrun near the
inside. EARTH STRIKE (IRE) was always far back. SONG OF INNOCENCE was unsettled early on the rail, and was finished after six furlongs. JOY OF
PAINTING raced three to four wide, and was outrun. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

SWING SHIFT sped to the lead at the start then came under pressure from CONGRESSMAN, dueled inside of rival through the turn, battled on gamely into
the lane, came out a path mid-stretch, dug in under firm handling and finished clear. BOURBON HEIST settled outside in the opening quarter, ranged up
closer late on the turn, roused forward to race in striking distance in late stages, could not reach the winner but captured place. POSITIVE REVIEW picked
up the pace near the half mile marker, raced in striking distance three wide around the turn, got in tight and steadied when CONGRESSMAN was forced out
a path mid-stretch, briefly lost momentum then came back on and just missed place. CONGRESSMAN moved up to challenge SWING SHIFT for the early
lead, dueled around the turn, battled on into the lane, got carried out a path mid-stretch, stayed on and lacked closing response. MAGIA NERA tracked the
pace through early stages, was ridden along two wide through the turn, shifted out five wide in the upper stretch and finished evenly. BENNY THE BOOK
raced off the early pace, saved ground, cut the corner entering the lane and passed tiring rivals. SURPASSING raced up close in the opening quarter,
flattened out around the turn, urged three wide into the lane and had no response. NO NAY FRANKLIN (IRE) saved ground and failed to move into
contention. CIANGO raced three wide around the turn and had no response when called upon. UMBRA got pulled up in the turn and vanned off after the
race. STEWARDS POSTED AND INQUIRY LOOKING INTO THE STRETCH RUN, THE TRAINER OF POSITIVE REVIEW CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST
SWING SHIFT FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN, AFTER REVIEW NO ACTION WAS TAKEN

Footnotes
BEAUTIFUL LOVER tracked the pace from the rail, angled three wide approaching the eighth pole, closed between foes and was up in the final strides.
SORREL (IRE) lacked early speed while saving round, advanced four wide around the far turn, closed outside and was up for the place on the wire.
ALWAYS SHOPPING set the pace along the rail, dug in inside of SCARABEA through the stretch, never let that one get past and led until the final strides.
SCARABEA was in range two wide, bid in upper stretch, vied to deep stretch and was outkicked. SISTER OTOOLE settled off the pace while racing two and
three wide and lacked the needed rally. ONYX broke awkwardly, saved ground off the pace and never threatened. NICENO was outrun inside. HUNGRY
KITTEN was sluggish early, trailed inside for a mile, went three wide around the far turn and played no factor. HONOR HOP prompted the pace two wide
and stopped near the three-eighths pole. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
WOLFIE'S DYNAGHOST led early inside before deferring to HELLO HOT ROD after a quarter-mile, moved out tracking the latter up the backstretch,
regained the lead midway on the second turn facing challenges from FROSTED OVER and JOURNEYMAN to his outside, edged away in upper stretch and
dug in for the decision. JOURNEYMAN was a step slow at the start, advanced through the middle stages, loomed four wide outside the leaders approaching
the stretch, and stayed on with good courage to be clearly second best. FROSTED OVER bumped with TELEPHONE TALKER early, stayed in range
through the opening half-mile, bid for command between horses in the three-path after six furlongs, weakened through the stretch and saved the show.
FANCY LIQUOR was skittish behind the gate briefly delaying the start, broke without incident and was forwardly placed two wide, moved inside through the
furlong grounds and lacked the needed closing response. SAND DANCER broke a bit slow, raced well back for six furlongs, came five wide into the stretch
and went by faders. ORDER AND LAW was crowded by HELLO HOT ROD after the start and bumped with TELEPHONE TALKER, raced in the second
flight two to three wide for six furlongs, had the rider lose the crop in upper stretch, and ran on evenly. TIESTO took an awkward first step and was off slow,
raced three to four wide and was no factor. MISCHIEF AFOOT broke slowly, and was always outrun. FIGHTING FORCE saved ground to no avail. HELLO
HOT ROD came in after the start herding ORDER AND LAW into TELEPHONE TALKER, took over outside WOLFIE'S DYNAGHOST and sped off up the
backstretch, and succumbed readily midway on the far turn. TELEPHONE TALKER was bumped early between ORDER AND LAW and FROSTED OVER,
and never menaced.

Footnotes
ABAAN was forwardly placed in opening stages and stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, roused forward and took over the lead mid-way through the
final turn, was ridden along two to three wide into the upper stretch, drifted out wider through the lane, stayed sharp under a right-handed drive and
maintained a clear advantage. TEMPLE was unhurried and raced near the back, picked up the pace late on the final turn, swung five wide into the lane,
responded willingly under pressure and produced a solid finish. MEDIA BLITZ stalked and saved ground through middle stages, picked up the pace along
the inside around the final turn, tipped three wide approaching the head of the lane, ran on with response and secured show. SOLE VOLANTE settled near
midpack, was ridden along four wide into the upper stretch, stayed in the mix but needed more for serious impact. GLYNN COUNTY raced in range and
saved ground, cut the corner entering the upper stretch, roused forward into closer contention then flattened in the final sixteenth. BAKERS BAY was
allowed to settle through early stages, save ground up the backstretch, was ridden along into the upper stretch and failed to kick on. MANDATE was
reserved racing in the back, swung out six wide entering the lane and passed tiring foes. BAMA BREEZE settled off the pace, was put to a drive two wide
into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. IN EFFECT was unhurried up the backstretch, roused four wide into the upper stretch and failed to move
on. KING CAUSE sped to the lead at the start, set the pace and saved ground, got collared by the winner mid-way around the final turn and steadily
weakened. FLYING SCOTSMAN raced in range through early stages, continued in contention two wide through the final turn then gave way.
FARMINGTON ROAD raced off the pace, saved ground and had no response when called upon. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
JUST ONE TIME was fractious in the starting gate, raced off the pace outside, advanced four and five wide around the turn, closed down the center of the
track, took the lead near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. FOUR GRACES settled off the pace while racing two wide, tipped three wide in
upper stretch and finished well between foes. JAKARTA pressed the pace two wide, took over nearing the three-eighths pole, angled in nearing the lane, led
to the sixteenth pole and weakened late. STARSHIP NALA stalked the pace three wide, bid nearing the quarter pole, turned for home on even terms outside
of JAKARTA, battled past the eighth pole and faded in the final sixteenth. PACIFIC GALE failed to menace while racing three wide. CRUMB BUN settled off
the early pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn, bid near three-eighths pole but came up empty in the lane. MON PETIT CHOU played no factor
while racing four wide. A G INDY bobbled at the break, chased the pace two wide and retreated through the stretch. FAMILY TIME was off slow, lacked
speed despite early urging, saved ground and made little impact. DANCE D'ORO set the early pace along the rail, stopped midway around the turn and was
eased through the lane.

Footnotes
REGAL GLORY was allowed to settle early three wide, began moving of her own accord circling five wide after six furlongs, kicked into high gear still not set
down in earnest through upper stretch, and swept past the leaders under a mild drive a sixteenth out to win going away. ALMS got bumped by GIFT LIST at
the start, took over outside SHIFTY SHE on the first turn and moved inside, vied with that rival around the far turn and into the stretch, and battled back
gamely for the place. SHIFTY SHE moved inside with the lead first time through the stretch, yielded to ALMS before going a quarter-mile, moved out to track
the leader up the backstretch, rebid around the far turn and into the stretch, and stayed on stubbornly between horses late. GIFT LIST (GB) broke out into
ALMS, saved ground close up under a firm hold early, tipped to the three-path after straightening away for the drive, and could not quicken appreciably
under pressure. BIPARTISANSHIP (GB) broke slowly, settled in midpack early three wide, and lacked a response when called on.. WAKANAKA (IRE) was
no factor through an inside trip. NICEST (IRE) lagged toward the back two wide for six furlongs, came a couple paths wider for the stretch run and made no
headway. SUMMER IN SARATOGA moved inside early, and never reached contention. IN A HURRY stayed in range for six furlongs, and tired. SWEET
MELANIA was taken out four wide coming off the first turn, remained well out in the course and faltered after six furlongs. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

SPEAKER'S CORNER matched strides for the lead out of the chute then cleared on top and angled inside, showed the way into the turn, challenged by a
duo at the three eighths pole, shook clear leaving the quarter pole, roused three wide into the upper stretch, responded willingly, drifted out wider under right
handed pressure, turned back the bid from FEARLESS in late stages and maintained a clear advantage. FEARLESS was allowed to settle out of the chute
then edged up to race midpack near the half mile marker, was ridden three to four wide around the turn, launched an outside bid for SPEAKER'S CORNER
heading into the lane, was set down outside under a left-handed drive, stayed on with solid response but had to settle for second best. OFFICIATING
stalked the pace outside up the backstretch, moved up three wide to challenge for the lead at the three-eighths pole, could not move on with the eventual
winner past the quarter pole but sustained a steady bid in the lane and prevailed for a share. GIROLAMO'S ATTACK was forwardly placed out of the chute
and stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, moved up to challenge for the lead at the three eighths pole, could not move on with the winner late on the
turn and tired in the drive. LIAM matched strides for the lead out of the chute then edged back into tracking position inside, hustled up along the rail around
the turn, failed to kick on and steadily weakened in the lane. SHIVAREE settled off the early pace, hustled along three to four wide around the turn and
failed to respond. PAYNE raced two to three wide off the early pace, failed to progress under pressure around the turn and faded in the lane. DENNIS'
MOMENT raced in the back, had no response and retreated in the lane. UPON REVIEW, THIS RACE WAS RETIMED BY HAND AND ADJUSTED FROM
THE ORIGINAL TIME.

Footnotes
COLONEL LIAM tracked the pace two wide between foes early, edged closer three wide down the backstretch, advanced three deep around the far turn,
seized command approaching the eighth pole and drew clear while drifting out under steady left-handed urging. NEVER SURPRISED was off a bit slow,
advanced outside to gain a clear lead nearing the first turn, set the pace in the two path, had the rider lose the whip in upper stretch, fought on inside of the
winner and held well to hold the place. SPACE TRAVELLER (GB) checked entering the first turn, saved ground well back, steadied near the quarter pole
then closed strongly inside of foes to gain the show. ATONE saved ground in midpack early, edged closer two wide around the far turn, angled four wide
turning for home, had aim outside of the winner but was one-paced through the final furlong. CROSS BORDER raced off the pace three wide between foes
around both turns and rallied between rivals. SACRED LIFE (FR) bumped with FIELD PASS at the start, raced well back two wide, edged closer three wide
around the far turn, came five wide into the lane and never threatened. DOSWELL stalked the pace in the three path, bid nearing the lane but was outkicked
in the stretch. HIT THE ROAD saved ground off the pace and lacked the needed rally. CHANNEL CAT chased the pace four wide around both turns and
lacked a rally. FIELD PASS bumped with SACRED LIFE at the start, raced four wide throughout and played no further factor. MARCH TO THE ARCH
checked getting out entering the first turn, raced three wide around that turn, went five wide around the far turn and made little impact. FLAVIUS was up
close inside to upper stretch and faded through the lane. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED. FRACTIONS AND RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE. FINAL TIME
CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
LIFE IS GOOD broke with the first flight, then was able to get clear in the three-path approaching the first turn, moved further out in the track establishing a
comfortable rhythm up the backstretch, widened the advantage after six furlongs still well within himself, was roused into the stretch and given a
right-handed reminder past the eighth-pole, and was shown the crop to 70 yards out before being taken in hand. KNICKS GO broke sharply, then brushed
with CHESS CHIEF in the ensuing strides and was prevented from getting off the rail, was able to work his way outward three or four paths after entering
the first turn, gave distant chase to LIFE IS GOOD to the stretch, could not make up the necessary ground but outbattled STILLETO BOY to get second in a
grinding effort. STILLETO BOY brushed with CHESS CHIEF while holding his position after the start, moved inward to the first turn and was closest to LIFE
IS GOOD early before being allowed to drop back some, got roused in earnest through an ample opening on the far turn inside, challenged inside KNICKS
GO for second rallying past the quarter-pole and into the stretch, then could not match strides with that foe late while best of the remainder. ENDORSED
moved out steadily leaving the first turn, raced widest of all up the backstretch, tried to overtake KNICKS GO from outside on the far turn to no avail, and
weakened through the stretch. SIR WINSTON bumped with EMPTY TOMB at the start, lagged well back early near the inside, moved out three wide to the
far turn, and could not reach contention. CHESS CHIEF broke alertly, then held his position while brushing with rivals from both sides in the next few strides,
dropped well back inside after a half-mile, and made no further impact. COMMANDEER was well back and three wide on the first turn, and never got
untracked. TITLE READY was far back throughout. EMPTY TOMB bumped with SIR WINSTON at the start, raced near the two-path through the first turn,
and was through after six furlongs.
