Footnotes
J J'S CROWN was sent along to set the early pace along the inside down the backstretch, was challenged entering the far turn, dug in late and prevailed
under all out pressure. MAJESTIC CAFE was allowed to settle early on, made a quick move to advance around the far turn, raced four wide near the three
sixteenths pole and finished gamely to the wire. YHA YHA was unhurried early on, raced four wide around the far turn, moved up five wide into the upper
stretch and made a good late rally. VODKA TWIST stalked the top pair early, dropped back a bit around the turn, moved up four wide in the drive and
showed good late interest. ROCKTHEPULPIT stalked the pace, raced along the inside around the turn through the stretch run and had no final winning bid.
SIR DEPUTY pressed the early leader, raced between rivals and weakened the final eighth of a mile. DOODLE TIME dropped back early on, raced towards
the inside and had no response.

SINGLE LADY was sent along to set the early pace, raced near the rail and held gamely in the drive to be clear under strong encouragement. BARONESS
VONTRAPPE stalked the top pair down the backstretch while racing near the rail, moved up two to three wide in the lane and finished second best. LADY
COMMISSIONER was fanned five wide around the first turn, settled off the early going, made a steady advance through the far turn, raced four wide into the
upper lane and made a good late gain. SURE ANGEL stalked the pace, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and flattened out. JUST CLASSY was
unhurried early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. SABINOS PRIDE raced in tight quarters soon after the start, was up
close down the backstretch and tired in the stretch run.

CITY AT NIGHT pressed the early leader while racing just off the inside down the backstretch, gained command just inside the quarter pole, raced off the
inside in the lane and held well to be clear under steady handling. JUAN BRAVO stalked the pace, moved up three to four wide in the lane and finished
second best. CHROME KING was slow early, moved up along the inside near the quarter pole and made a good late gain. TENGO SED was quick to begin
from the outside to set a pressured early pace and weakened in the stretch run. TWO GUNS stalked the early pace and weakened from the inside. HEY
NOW was bumped at the break, raced towards the inside and had no late response. VELVET GHOST failed to sustain a bid.
