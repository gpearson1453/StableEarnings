Footnotes
CANELITO set the pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane and drew off under a drive. MEKANO prompted the pace in the three path,
was no match for the winner but stayed on to hold second. BOARD CERTIFIED saved ground in range, angled out in upper stretch and was along for the
show. MUROMEC saved ground off the pace, went two wide between rivals around the far turn and improved position in the lane. SUMMER SHANDEE
tracked the pace four wide and faded in the lane. UNIFIED CONQUEST failed to menace while racing four wide. LOVE IN PARADISE saved ground in
midpack early, went three wide around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. POETIC CODE broke outwardly and bumped at the start, was up close two
wide between foes, steadied midway around the first turn, chased inside around the far turn and tire din the lane. ECCENTRICO was outrun inside. STAR
BHAI UNION was pinched back at the start, raced well back throughout while four wide around the first turn and saved ground around the far turn.
SIDNEY'S BID broke inwardly and bumped at the start, steadied nearing the first turn and made little further impact while racing three and four wide. CYNIC
steadied along throughout the opening quarter, raced two wide and played no factor.

Footnotes
GODS PROMISE was forwardly placed racing outside the early leader, moved up and took a slim lead at the quarter pole, widened advantage two wide
turning for home, continued to pull away with ease and remained well clear. WILD TEXAS TOM raced off the early pace, circled up closer three wide around
the turn, sustained a four wide bid though the lane and cleared second best. EASTERN SYMPHONY set the pace toward the inside up the backstretch, got
collared for the lead by the winner near the quarter pole, remained forwardly placed into the upper stretch then came up empty and weakened to show.
MACHO REAL was reserved racing in the back, coaxed two wide into the upper stretch and had a mild improve. KLEON raced in range up the backstretch,
was ridden along four wide through the turn, came out wider for the drive and had no late response. CAMP PENDLETON raced off the early pace, hustled
along three wide into the lane and failed to kick on. WESTERLY WIND stalked the pace up the backstretch, was ridden along the rail through the turn but
had no response and steadily faded.

LUCKY LATKES was bumped between horses at the start, advanced four wide outside the leaders approaching the stretch, battled outside CODE NAME
LISA through the final furlong and took a hard-fought decision. CODE NAME LISE bumped with LUCKY LATKES at the start, tracked the early pace, moved
out three wide to challenge for command between horses into the stretch, stayed on her left lead through a late duel and was outfinished. SHANIAH saved
ground outsprinted for three-eighths of a mile, moved out for the drive and was gaining late outside the top two. MUDSLIDE WICKED vied outside
TWELFTH MOON while brushing with that one entering the turn, fought on between horses to upper stretch, then gave way. TWELFTH MOON dueled
inside MUDSLIDE WICKED while brushing with that one to the turn, and gave way inside approaching the stretch. KHOZZY VALINTINE broke in having to

Footnotes
KATHLEEN O. hesitated at the start then was shut off by a bumped inward foe, raced well back inside down the backstretch, cruised up four wide around
the turn, seized command in upper stretch and readily drew off under mostly hand urging. MI NEGRITA set the pace in the two path, put away her pace
rivals nearing the lane, continued on the left lead in the stretch, had no response for the winner but stayed on willingly to hold the place. FAST AND FLIRTY
tracked the pace four wide, bid nearing the lane, could not keep pace with the winner and could never get past the pacesetter for the place. QUEEN
CAMILLA was bumped between foes at the start, raced well back two and three wide, angled six wide nearing the lane and never threatened. FRECCIA
D'ARGENTO had early speed between foes, chased two wide around the turn and came up empty in the lane. JUMEIRAH broke inwardly and bumped
QUEEN CAMILLA into SURREAL FANTASY at the start, prompted the pace three wide between foes and retreated after six furlongs. SURREAL FANTASY
was soundly bumped at the start, showed speed inside but was through after a half.

patiently for a clear path around the far turn, shifted out four to five paths wide heading into the lane, responded under right-handed pressure and drew
clear. OCEAN SAFARI raced two wide and settle near midpack heading into the backstretch, sat off the three way duel late on the far turn, given cue turning
for home, roused forward three deep, held a slim lead past the furlong marker then got outkicked by the winner. OPALINA was forwardly placed three wide
around the first turn, stalked the pace up the backstretch, vied three deep for the lead around the far turn, fought back to the furlong marker then weakened
to show. LADY PUCHI was unhurried and raced in the last flight through early stages, roused late on the far turn, came five wide into the lane and had a
mild improve. STRATEGY QUEEN settled inside in the last flight, saved ground through the far turn, shifted out approaching top stretch and lacked a
needed rally. LI LI BEAR set the pace up the backstretch, vied for the lead around the far turn and tired in the drive. LOUELLA STREET was forwardly

Footnotes
EMICRACK (CHI) set the pace removed from the rail, shook off LUCKY AS A SEVEN through midstretch, then held off WAR FEATHER to the finish. WAR
FEATHER broke in midpack but dropped back to last soon after, entered the turn trailing in the four-path, moved steadily inward advancing after
three-eighths of a mile, rallied inside EMICRACK leaving the furlong grounds and was too late. CAMPEADOR raced in the second flight early two to three
wide, split horses finding his best stride a sixteenth out and finished well. LUCKY AS A SEVEN brushed and bumped with MR. COOL repeatedly through
the opening stages, pursued EMICRACK from outside into the turn, could not keep pace with a furlong remaining and gave way. NAVY PIER saved ground
throughout, and lacked the needed closing bid. C. P. A. GENIUS raced three to four wide, and could not gain under pressure through the lane. MR. COOL
brushed and bumped repeatedly with LUCKY AS A SEVEN early on, moved up between calls leaving the backstretch, retreated around the turn while
cautiously handled and was eased up through the lane.

Footnotes
LIGHTENING LARRY set the pace along the rail, drew clear around the turn and held firm under left-handed urging. OF A REVOLUTION stalked the pace
from the rail, tipped two wide near the quarter pole, had aim on the winner in upper stretch, slowly gained but was held at bay. O CAPTAIN raced off the
pace three wide and churned on to best the rest. LAST LEAF saved ground and failed to menace. CONCRETE GLORY was fractious in the starting gate,
pressed the winner two wide and tired after a half. BUENO BUENO had speed three wide and retreated nearing the lane. SUMMERY was pulled up on the
backstretch and was vanned off.

Footnotes
ASKEW raced three wide around the first turn, settled off the pace up the backstretch, headed in pursuit three wide through the far turn, came four wide into
the lane, roused forward into striking distance at the furlong marker, dug in under steady pressure and edged away. LA RUSIA stalked three wide up the
backstretch, launched a bid turning for home, vied two wide between rivals at the furlong marker and got outkicked by the winner. PERFECT KIMBERLY S
settled nicely in range two wide through early stages, moved to the inside around the far turn, cut the corner entering the stretch run, held a slim lead past
the furlong marker then lacked closing response. KHOSEA raced midpack five wide early, picked up the pace four wide through the far turn, fanned five
wide into the lane, took closer order then finished evenly. HARDLY SOCIAL raced two wide around the first turn, remained unhurried up the backstretch,
coaxed three wide into the lane, gained position then lacked the needed kick to move on. CACTUS KITTEN was off a step slow at the start, raced in the last
flight, came three wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. BLUE EYE KITTEN fanned four wide around the first turn, settled off the early pace, was
ridden along three to four wide late on the far turn and failed to move on. TIDAL WATERS led early, yielded to BACKSTRETCH BEAUTY to the backstretch,
regained command entering the far turn, yielded to challengers from both flanks at the top of the stretch, and retreated. BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY moved in
from the six-path to get the lead late on the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch, got collared into the final turn and gave way. KAY'S PROJECT raced
inside near midpack and retreated around the final turn.

Footnotes
GRAND SONATA broke slowly and was three wide into the first turn, took closer order up the backstretch in the clear, came four wide off the far turn
beginning to get in gear, rallied determinedly and was up outside CHANCEUX in time. CHANCEUX quickly took command, rated along a bit off the inside
for six furlongs, shrugged off a bid from GINGRICH and kicked clear again in upper stretch, swapped back to his left lead leaving the furlong grounds and
just failed to last. FATHER GLADO saved ground unhurried to the far turn, moved out three wide past the quarter-pole, went a bit further out through
midstretch and finished with good energy outside the top two. GINGRICH was a step slow to begin, prompted CHANCEUX from outside early, was roused
on the far turn and closed the gap, but could not sustain the bid once straightened away for the drive. SMOKIN' T raced two wide on the turns, and lacked a
solid closing response. K. C. CHIEF pulled his way along resisting restraint inside early, and was empty when asked. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED,
FRACTIONS AND RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
SIMPLIFICATION set the pace in the two path, took some pressure around the turn, re-cleared nearing the lane and widened under mild urging through the
stretch. STRIKE HARD had early sped inside of the winner, dropped back under a bit of urging down the backstretch, raced two wide around the turn, split
foes in upper stretch and finished willingly to be clearly second best. MR RUM RUNNER stalked the pace inside, could not keep pace with the winner
nearing the lane but won the duel for the show. GRAPHIC DETAIL settled off the early pace outside, edged closer four wide around the turn and lacked the
needed rally. SPORT PEPPER was outrun while racing well off the rail. SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING prompted the winner in the three path and retreated after
six furlongs.

Footnotes
MARISA'S MISSION settled two wide around the first turn, rated near midpack up the backstretch, loomed boldly three wide near the quarter pole, took over
the lead late on the far turn, widened advantage under steady pressure and remained well clear. DRILLOMATIC angled to the inside shortly after the start,
saved ground while unhurried up the backstretch, picked up the pace late on the far turn, fanned five wide into the lane, closed with response and captured
place. TIMMY M. tracked the pace inside through early stages, launched a two wide bid midway through the far turn, dropped to the inside turning for home,
was ridden along the rail into the lane, evened out in late stages and got caught for place. AMBASSADOR JIM settled and saved ground through early
stages, picked up the pace near the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane, gained closer contention near the furlong marker then yielded and lost
position. PLATO raced two wide around the first turn, rated off the early pace, urged outside through the far turn, fanned six wide into the lane and passed
tiring rivals. FARLEY was forwardly placed around the first turn, vied for the lead up the backstretch, shook free midway through the far turn, held on top
past the quarter pole, got collared by the winner turning for home and gave way. NATIONAL HONOR stalked the embattled pair up the backstretch, came
under a ride around the far turn, failed to advance under pressure and faded in the lane. KEEPSAKEKITTEN was reserved racing in the back, saved ground
through the final turn and failed to move into contention. IT'S FATE saved ground around the first turn, was no too far back in early stages then flattened and
lost position, came three wide into the lane and had no late response. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR led the way around the first turn, vied for the lead up the
backstretch, could not match on the frontend midway through the final turn and steadily retreated.
