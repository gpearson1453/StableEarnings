LIPSTICK LADY pressed the pace of SOLA while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that rival nearing the quarter, vied into deep stretch and edged
away late. SOLA was away in good order to set a pressured pace, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the quarter, vied with that rival
through a vigorous drive and gave way grudgingly late. LA CAPRICHOSA was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and
failed to gain in the drive. R THING showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. DR GS SWEETIE broke sharply
to show brief speed and weakened.

HOYA PARANOYA set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths pole and drew off through the lane as
the handiest of winners. CAPTAIN COOL was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive
but finished well to gain the plain. THIRD WHEEL lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. WIND RIVER pressed
the pace while racing four-wide and gave way after going a half. D VON TAE was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn and was
not a factor. THIRSTY KISS settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. MR LOVE MUFFIN showed no early
speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not threaten. BEL RAGAZZO showed no early speed, saved ground throughout and and did not threaten.

Footnotes
LINDA'S BALLET settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, responded when set down for the drive and wore down THUNDER
WOMAN in the closing yards. THUNDER WOMAN was away in good order to set a pressured pace pace, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter,
remained in control through mid-stretch but could not hold the winner off late. MY FUNNY GAL pressed the pace of THUNDER WOMAN while racing
four-wide and gave way after going a half. GUARDING ELK CAMP was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with some late
run. SLEIGH RIDE was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and gradually gave way. TRANS MISSISSIPPI was void of early foot,
raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. IZZY B showed no early speed, rider lost whip nearing the five-sixteenths pole, raced three-wide
through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
LE TUB set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and was ridden out to increase that
advantage. ELDORADO DREAM bobbled at the start, chased the winner while racing four-wide throughout, was no match for that rival in the drive but
clearly second best. MISCHIEF MAMA was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. MS
MICHELLE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with a belated bid. TRINNI
SUNSET showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. YOU NEVER CALL raced off the pacesetters early, moved
three-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. SHE'S SO BAD was off a step slow, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not
offer a bid. CANDY RUNNER was void of early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
MCGOLDIE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up four-wide top offer a bid into the lane, gained a slight advantage and held the closing TICK
TOCK off to prevail. TICK TOCK was never far back, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and was gaining late. SUPAH SISTA
disputed the pace from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and gave way through the final sixteenth. AROUSE N GO settled off the leaders
early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. SHESAHEATWAVE disputed the pace from the inside for a half and weakened.
MONGOLIAN EMPIRE lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. BARBELLO (NZ) was void of early speed, raced five-wide
through the turn and did not menace. TOP HAT HIGH JINKS vied for the lead while racing four-wide and weakened through the final furlong. TWITTERATI
lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. FICTIONAL was off a step slow, saved ground through the turn and did not
threaten.

Footnotes
ADD ON raced four-wide through the first turn, opened a clear lead before going a quarter, was well rated through the back-stretch and held BACK ALLEY
CAT safely to the wire. BACK ALLEY CAT was off a step slow, settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch, reached a striking
position but failed to gain on the winner late. BLUES RAPPER was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly
late. RISE UP MOSCOW was never far back while racing along the inside throughout and failed to gain in the drive. GIVE A LITTLE chased the leaders
while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. LUCKY CHANCE lagged, raced six-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid.
