Footnotes
OKLAHOMA STAR vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, drove clear and held on well for the win. SHANGHAI HETTY bothered at the start,
getting in a traffic jam, raced within contention, made a late bid, four wide and was gaining on the winner. MARYJO'S DUCHESS raced within striking
distance, made an inside bid, but proved no match for the top two. CAGED BEAR broke out, raced near the back, made a mild bid, finished four wide and
was no real factor. LOCO LUCY broke in, shot to the front, challenged on the front end and faded. FEATHERINHERHALO void of early speed, saved
ground around the turn and was never a threat. SILVER CHATAIN pressed the pace, raced outside around the turn and dropped back. MY LITTLE GUERA
bothered at the start, getting in tight quarters, raced near the middle of the pack, came around the turn wide and faded.

Footnotes
SASSY EMMA vied for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, drove clear, was collared down the stretch by WON DAY, dueled to the wire and
just held on for the win. WON DAY pressed the pace, angled out entering the stretch, dueled to the wire and just missed. BALLERINI challenged for the
early lead, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. ROLL BABY raced within striking distance, saved ground around the turn and put forth an
even effort. CYPRESS QUEEN void of early speed and was never a threat. SPLENDA GAIL always raced near the back, came around the turn on the
outside, finished wide and was no factor.

Footnotes
BASSETT raced within contention, got through on the inside around the final turn, drove clear down the stretch and held off a late charge by SIR
OVERANALYZE for the win. SIR OVERANALYZE lacked early speed, moved up on the outside around the second turn, rallied down the lane and closed
fast. KASENS TRAIN bothered at the start, racing in the rear, gained ground, but proved no match for the top two. HE'S A CLASSIC went to the front, drove
clear and lacked a finish. THISGUYCANFLY pressed the pace, faded and finished evenly. SWEETSWEETSONG raced near the middle of the field in the
beginning and retreated. SODBUSTER broke out sharply, raced near the middle of the pack, came around the first turn on the outside and dropped back.

DIXIE LADY vied for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, drove clear and was kept to the task. PAISLEY CROSS pressed the pace, saved ground
around the turn, made a bid after turning for home, couldn't catch the winner, but was a clear second. TRACK SMART showed early speed, forwardly
placed throughout and proved no match for the top two. TAP OUT FAST raced within striking distance, saved ground around the turn, made a late bid and
got up for show. MY SISTER ANNETTE lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. SWEET PRAYERS pressed the early pace and faded.
LADY HOPPER dueled on the front end, came around the turn three wide and was finished early. GIRL IN BLACK void of early speed, finished inside and
was no threat.

Footnotes
STEPHEN'S ANSWER dueled for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, drove clear after turning for home and won under steady urging. BOW AND
ARROW raced within striking distance, came around the second turn three wide, couldn't catch the winner, but was best of others. DECEMBER SEVEN
pressed the pace, raced close throughout and lacked a late kick. PINCH ASSAULT void of early speed, raced outside around the first turn, showed late
interest, but was no factor. MUSCADINE raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. MINNESOTA MIRACLE lacked early speed and was
never a threat. SPEEDY FELLAR challenged for the early lead and faded. FORT KNOX always raced near the back and showed little.

SUPREME vied for the early lead, dueled throughout and was outfinished for the win. WILLIAM GUSTAVO broke out, dueled for the lead, saved ground
around the turn and was outfinished and just missed second. THE Z MAN pressed the pace, eased back, made a mild bid, but was no factor. UNSOLVED
raced within contention, weakened and finished evenly. HE IS WORTHY lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. BOONE LAND BYE YOU
raced near the back and was never a threat. V. R. FRIENDLYGARY bumped at the start, challenged for the early lead, saved ground around the turn and
dropped back. COWBOY HAY HAY raced in the back, moved up, rallied wide down the home stretch, propped, ducked out, lost rider and walked off. A
