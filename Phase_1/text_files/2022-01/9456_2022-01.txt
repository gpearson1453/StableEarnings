Footnotes
SAQEEL four wide in the first turn while allowing the pace to go early, steadily advanced in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, bid three wide
midway on that bend, dueled into the stretch, drew well clear under steady handling. HANEY BOYS bumped slightly at the break, contested the early pace,
settled behind the leader backstretch, bid between foes midway on the second turn, dueled inside the winner entering the stretch, could not keep up with
that one the final furlong. MY FAVORITE UNCLE lacked early foot while racing outside, three wide into the lane, no threat to the top two in the run to the
wire, clearly second best. SERBIAN SAILOR void of speed toward the inside, continued to save some ground second turn, traffic exiting that bend,
improved slightly. PLENTY OF CENTS broke out and bumped AMAZING ROCKET who in turn lightly bumped HANEY BOYS, was straightened and raced
forwardly in the first turn, one paced the middle half then had little left for the drive. CHISHOLM TRAIL four wide through both turns, lacked bid. HOLIDAY
TICKET in mid pack and three wide, tired in the drive. AMAZING ROCKET bumped start, was used a bit to be well clear before a half, gave way when
headed midway on the final turn. UNCLE MO'S CAT in the main body for three quarters, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
SUMMER STORM never far back while racing outside, advanced to the fore three wide midway on the turn, came four wide into the stretch when putting a
head in front, drew steadily clear through the lane while being kept to pressure. LADY MAGNA in the second flight while three wide, asked along midway on
the turn, felt the crop late in the bend, gradual rally to be up for the place, not a threat to the winner. CREDIT ENHANCEMENT prompted the early leader off
the inside, challenged between rivals and inside the winner midway on the turn, briefly dueled with that one upper stretch, could not keep pace the final
furlong, weakened a bit and was caught for the second spot. FABLES LOVE AFFAIR lacked speed, angled out three wide late in the turn, improved slightly
while not a serious threat. LIL MISS HOT MESS failed to menace while racing in the two path. WARM BEAUTY off a step slow, trailed most of the way,
picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not proving to be a factor. MARY ALICE back off the pace while racing four wide, faded through the stretch.
ARROWSPHERE broke on top, set the pace up the backstretch and early in the turn, stopped when headed midway on the turn.

Footnotes
HAMAZING LACE within striking distance while outside, four wide into the turn when beginning to move on the leader, hooked up with that one late in the
turn, spirited duel to the wire, proved narrowly best in determined fashion. LORI'S EYES away in good order, set pace up the backstretch, responded when
challenged in the turn, extended duel, proved stubborn to the very end. SHE'S HAMAZING settled off the pace inside, moved closer while continuing to
save ground into the stretch, flattened out in the late going. LIFE OF SATURDAYS lacked speed, four wide into the turn, five wide exiting, displayed some
modest interest to improve position down the lane. FLIRTATIOUS SMILE forwardly placed early toward the inside, angled out to be four wide turning for
home, came up empty for the stretch run. HALF SCOUT settled off the early pace and the inside, two path through the turn, also failed to muster a rally
when called on. CHAI TEA five wide into the turn when well off the pace, angled in toward the rail late in the turn, went evenly the final furlong. ON A
SHOESTRING five wide through the turn, lacked a rally. FEMININE ALLURE broke out then made little impact. SHINING TERRI chased the runner up
early, began a steady retreat in the three path before a half. DEBBIES'S ROCKET hesitated a bit at the break to be last away, moved up then steadied in
traffic with a half mile to run, fell back.

Footnotes
HORSE GREEDY in the second flight off the inside, asked turn, took over nearing the furlong marker inside the leader, responded when confronted late by
the runner up to prevail in determined fashion. FIRERY TALE off the early pace inside, saved ground early turn, moved out a bit and split foes when
beginning to advance late in the bend, challenged outside the winner late, not enough in the final strides, well clear of the others. REPLETE off the early
pace outside up the backstretch, steered in to the two path into the turn, came three wide into the lane and just outside the runner up, could not keep up
with that one through the stretch, finished up evenly to be best of the rest. KEESAWAH pushed in at the break, raced well back in the two path through the
turn, improved position through the stretch while not a threat to the top three. HE'S MUNNIE one paced while racing outside, four wide into the stretch,
lacked a closing punch. SIDETOWN broke in, was quickly straightened to sprint well clear soon after, continued to hold a daylight advantage through the
turn, came out a bit to be three wide for the drive, gave way readily when challenged soon after. BLUERIDGE TRAVELER lacked a response while saving
ground to no avail. TRUE SAINT closest to the leader in the run up the backstretch, began to fade before a half. OLSON failed to menace while four out to
five wide through the turn. SUPER WISE jostled at the start to be last away, remained back. FIXICO broke out to bother SUPER WISE, was never close.
SHAKE IT was always outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
UNEMBELLISHED closest to the leader while racing off the inside, patiently pursued that one up the backstretch, collared that same rival from the outside
midway on the final turn, drew out steadily through the lane while being kept to pressure. MOUNTAIN TIME allowed to settle off the pace while in some
traffic first turn, saved ground, angled out into the two path turning for home, finished willingly to be clear for the place, not a threat to the winner. MO HEAT
forwardly placed along the inside, continued to save some ground into the lane, finished up best of the others. ROUSING SIREN four wide into the first turn,
rated middle half, came three wide into the lane, went evenly to the wire. LUCKS BIG BOY sprinted clear to show the way through the first turn just off the
inside, continued to set a comfortable pace up the backstretch, weakened when confronted by the winner midway on the final turn. GUARDSMAN PASS
broke back, lacked speed for six furlongs, four wide out of the final turn, improved position down the stretch while remaining well out in the strip. SLIGHTLY
CRAFTY went one paced throughout while racing in the two path. NUGGET OF GRACE saved ground in vain throughout. WARNING LABEL forwardly
placed while racing off the inside gave way in the three path far turn. FALCON HEAVY four wide into the first turn, moved closer by midway, five wide when
giving way late in the final turn, continued to retreat through the stretch. PURE IRON off slow, trailed throughourt.

Footnotes
CHASING TIME broke on top, showed the way into the first turn, relinquished the advantage onto the backstretch, stalked into the far turn, retook the
advantage from that rival soon after, turned back a bid from the inside turning to the lane, well clear, won geared down. VODKA N WATER settled off the
pace inside, advanced and challenged briefly inside the winner turning for home, proved no match for that one to the wire, remained clear for the place.
CHARTER OAK broke out, lacked speed toward the inside, saved ground second turn, got through inside turning into the lane, finished up best of the rest.
WICKED GENIUS back off the pace and the inside, three wide through both turns, went evenly through the stretch. SPEAK UNITY bothered at the start to
be last away, was used to advance and clear five wide through the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch when attempting to rate, offered little
resistance to the winner in the second turn and began to weaken. IMMORAL lacked speed in the two path, continued back the middle half, traffic, brief wait
with five sixteenths remaining, came up empty when clear for the drive. ELUSIVE TARGET void of speed, remained always back. FORT DEFIANCE four
wide into the first turn, angled in a bit, raced forwardly after a half then tired when four wide again in the second turn. BITCOIN BANKER five wide into the
first turn, continued outside, five wide again second bend, tired.

Footnotes
AWESOME TAYLOR off the pace while racing outside, advanced four wide into contention through the final turn, long drive, steady handling, proved best.
ICE ORCHID settled behind the leaders off the inside early, asked along in the three path second turn, began to advance into the lane, finished willingly to
be getting to the winner late. SWAP SHOP broke on top, well clear before a quarter, continued to show the way up the backstretch, responded when
challenged in the second turn, gave ground grudgingly down the lane. AIN'T BROKE four wide into the first turn, closer before a half outside, lodged a bid
midway on the final turn, gained control and showed the way past the furlong marker, faltered in the late going. FAITH'S REWARD angled in to save some
ground first turn, raced forwardly for a half then began to gradually weaken. SWEET BEAUTY shuffled back at the start, void of speed, improved position
without posing a serious threat. PRINCESS PAULINE lacked early speed, moved out, raced four wide through the final turn, failed to muster a rally. STAR
TABLE broke a step slow, trailed much of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. CLAY'S CLOUD BURST remained
always back. WICKED WONDER forwardly placed for a half, gave way.

Footnotes
KNEEDEEPINSNOW close from the start, engaged the leader into the stretch, heated duel past the furlong marker, wore that rival down to edge clear under
firm handling. SEVEN NATION ARMY broke alertly, set the pace up the backstretch inside, responded when confronted by the winner turning for home,
proved stubborn until late. C Z ROCKET back off the early pace toward the inside, angled out to be four wide turning into the stretch, improved slightly while
proving no match for the top pair. MOJO MAN settled off the pace racing along the inside, continued to saved ground thro ugh the turn but could manage
only an even effort. LYKAN lacked speed, moved out for the run into the turn, floated out five wide by C Z ROCKET exiting the turn, failed to produce a rally.
CAZADERO within striking distance while three wide for a half, lacked a closing kick in the drive. ATTACHMENT RATE last away, trailed throughout in
showing little.

Footnotes
LIL KINGS PRINCESS away well from the outside vied into the first turn, got clear onto the backstretch, continued to show the way by daylight into and
through the final turn, stayed clear in the drive under steady handling. SUNNY ISLE BEACH steadied in traffic late in the first turn in some traffic, continued
in traffic second turn, two path into the lane, rallied for the place while not a threat to the winner. TOO PRETTY vied early inside the winner, chased that one
through the middle quarter, could do little with the winner in the drive, caught for the place. LEGENDARY GIFT in mid pace early along the inside, moved
out and raced four wide through the second turn, displayed a modest amount of late interest to improve position, not enough late for the place. PRINCESS
LEA fell back to trail soon after the start, advanced and angled out four wide turning into the stretch, improved position. GLAMOUR GIRL well back early
inside, two path through the second turn, improved upper stretch then flattened out a bit in the final furlong. SHIP IT in mid pack off the inside, three wide
through the second turn, also finished up evenly. TRUMPET LILLY angled in when forwardly paced in the first turn, raced within striking distance for the next
half mile then weakened when the real running began turning for home. SENSE YOU LEFT prompted the early pace, began a steady retreat after a half
while three wide. UNBURNT off a step slow, raced four wide through the first turn, five wide through the second while remaining back. FRONT STREET
settled, moved closer in the final turn in the three path then stopped in the run to the wire, jogged across.
