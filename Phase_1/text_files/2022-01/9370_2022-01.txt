Footnotes
STOP THE FRIEND pressed the pace, made an outside rally and drove clear before the wire. MY KIKI dueled for the early lead, saved ground around the
turn, proved no match late for the winner, but held on for second. C C CROWN'S CHOICE challenged on the front end, forwardly placed throughout and
was outfinished for second. HAPPYGOBUCKY lacked early speed, came around the turn wide, made an outside gain and missed the show position.
KLEINMEISTER lacked early speed, moved up, but was no factor. OKALANI void of early speed and was never close. THAT'S ALL RIGHT raced in the
middle of the field and faded. BIGJIM'S SILVERGAL flashed early speed and dropped back.

MILA'S KAT vied for the early lead, drove clear around the final turn and was kept to the task. BOSTON LUCILLE lacked early speed, came around the first
turn on the outside, entered the home stretch four wide, made a bid and was a clear second at the wire. TRICKY MOM pressed the pace, forwardly placed
throughout and was a clear third at the wire. LEUDEAL raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the final turn and finished evenly. EL
CALIENTE LADY lacked early speed, saved ground around the second turn, moved up, but was no factor. DIAMONDS SHINING broke poorly, racing in the
rear and was never a threat. MY GAL CHARLOTTE raced within striking distance and faded. BOSTON PROSPECT dueled on the front end and stopped.

vied for the early advantage, raced close throughout, made a late bid and finished willingly. WONDER RUN shot to the front, drove clear, saved ground and
hung late. ZCAT'S CHATAIN raced near the middle of the field, saved ground around the turn, made a mild bid and finished evenly. ICE PEAK broke in the

Footnotes
GETCHA stalked the leader in the early going, made a bid around the second turn, drove clear down the lane and finished well. RANGE OF MOTION went
to the front, drove clear, proved no match late for the winner, but was best of others. THE THIMBLE raced within contention, saved ground around the final
turn and proved no match for the top two. REAL BRAVE unhurried in the beginning, moved up around the second turn, made a mild bid, but was no factor.
GOTTA A. P. B. lacked early speed, improved position, but was no threat. MICHAEL'S BAD BOY pressed the early pace and faded. UNBRIDLED PULPIT
lacked early speed and was never close. THE BIG IRISHMAN always raced near the back and showed little. DAVID'S GRACE raced within striking
distance, dropped back and was outrun.

Footnotes
ELISHER broke poorly, racing near the back, moved up on the outside around the turn, rallied and drove clear. PRICED RIGHT vied for the early
advantage, dueled throughout, but proved no match late for the winner. DRYSPELL raced near the middle of the field, moved up, challenged for the lead
and was outfinished by the top two. LUCKY BIG DADDY raced within contention, was close throughout, while putting forth a game effort. SHADY'S TURN
pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn and weakened. SHE CAUSED IT void of early speed, came around the turn wide, moved up, but was no
factor. GILDERSLEEVE lacked early speed and showed little. BRUSH WITH CAUTION showed brief speed and dropped back. BELIEVE IN PARTS
challenged for the early lead and retreated.
