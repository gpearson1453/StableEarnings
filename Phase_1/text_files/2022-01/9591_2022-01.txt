Footnotes
SONDE ST BLUES raced with the early pace two deep and took the lead into the backstretch, came under pressure at the seven sixteenths pole, pulled
clear of LIL MR MATT toward the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the rail and was steadily handled through the lane. The latter, ran loose for three
quarters of a mile in the post parade then stumbled at the break, stalked three wide into the backstretch, challenged at the seven sixteenths pole but
dropped back toward the five sixteenths, raced off the rail on the far turn and couldn't improve in the stretch. KITE SURFER settled off the pace in the three
and four paths on the first turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and finished evenly. THORN OF ROSE HILL
raced well off the early pace while saving ground, bid into the backstretch and improved position in the three path of the far turn, drifted toward the head of
the lane then flattened late stretch. LUCKY PENGUIN set the early pace inside, was headed leaving the first turn, gave chase from that point but faded
through the backstretch. MASTER YOO settled back off the rail on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. MR. SNAP was through
early.

YOLO CHARLOTTE took the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole and rated the pace, widened at the rail on the turn and further increased the lead of her
own initiative. TUESDAY TOO gave chase, ran in the four path of the turn then dueled through the stretch for second. IN THE NEWS chased from the
seven sixteenths pole and rounded the turn in the two and three paths, drifted toward the top of the lane then outfinished in the stretch duel for second.
SWISS HORIZON gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn then outfinished for second and third later yards. WOODSONG'S CASTLE chased, raced
in the three path of the turn, was eased to the five path toward the top of the lane and finished evenly. S S ENERGY broke awkwardly then angled out to
give chase and rounded the turn in the six path. LIL BUNNY was never in contention. This race was hand timed.

MISSING MY POINT pressured the pace inside and contested even terms at the rail on the turn, dueled clear of Who's Your Daddy leaving the turn, dug in
under steady stretch encouragement but was caught in later yards. CHRISTINE'S COSMO was bumped at the break then gave chase, drifted toward the
head of the stretch, finished well to take third late stretch and was gaining on the runner-up. WHO'S YOUR DADDY took the lead nearing the seven
sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, contested even terms two deep on the turn, but dropped back past the eighth pole and flattened stride the final
sixteenth. LOOKIN BACK broke outward to make contact with Christine's Cosmo, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three
path and ran evenly in the lane. DAMISELA gave chase, was carried outward toward the head of the stretch and showed little further. GRANDMA SCHNUR

Footnotes
GOLDEN SWEETS took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, was mildly pressured at the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then
widened, mostly on her own, through the lane. SWEET ASHLEY stalked in the three and four paths, bid toward the five sixteenths pole, steadily improved at
the rail on the far turn but had to settle for second best. GOLDEN GLOW stalked the earlier pace off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the
far turn about the three path and ran evenly down the lane. RHYTHM AND POWER settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, bid into the
backstretch, rounded the far turn four wide then flattened the final sixteenth. COOKIE DUNK DUNK settled off the rail on the opening turn, bid nearing the
quarter pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, angled to the three path entering the stretch and finished evenly. OHH BEEHAVE rounded the first turn in the
four path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn, steadied between horses leaving the turn and had little left.
PLANETARY stalked off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole then faded on the far turn. SHE'S A BIRDIE showed little
response. MISS BEE HIVING pulled up lame past the five eighths pole and was vanned off.

Footnotes
NO CHANGE saved ground on the first turn, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail, dug in for the lead while exchanging
light contact with SAVATIANO mid-stretch and was steadily handled to inch further ahead, while the latter raced with the early pace two deep then took over
toward the nine sixteenths pole, moved clear into the backstretch, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn near the rail,
was steadily encouraged leaving the turn, exchanged light contact with the winner and reluctantly relented the final sixteenth. ISHIHARA settled off the rail
the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn, lost some ground entering the stretch then flattened stride. EVENT
PARTY ran off the pace in the three path the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole then flattened stride off the rail on the far turn. AMICUS
BRIEF rated close in the three and four paths the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then flattened off the rail on the far turn.
ZORB came away a bit awkwardly then took a brief early lead, was caught at the rail nearing the nine sixteenths pole, gave chase then weakened
approaching the five sixteenths.

UNEQUIVOCAL raced with the early pace two deep, took the lead inside approaching the three eighths pole, drew clear into the far turn and was steadily
handled through the lane. IRISH MEADOW settled off the pace inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path, angled to
the five path nearing the head of the lane and finished well to take second later yards. MARTIN MAN settled off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole,
raced close in the three path of the far turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. CHARGING LION had the early lead inside but was caught at the three
quarter pole and stalked from that point, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close at the rail on the far turn but flattened through
the lane. TAPPING THE GLASS rounded the opening turn in the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole then
flattened in the four path of the far turn. I AM THAT I AM was never a factor. HE'S NOT CURLY rounded the first turn in the four path then closed to even
terms leaving the three quarter pole, was caught and gave chase from the three eighths then faded at the rail on the far turn.

OPERA NITE settled off the pace and off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced close through the far turn, dueled to the lead mid-stretch and
drew clear later yards. AARON'S TAP raced with the early pace two deep, took the lead into the backstretch and was rated from that point, drew clear at the
three eighths pole, came under pressure at the quarter, rounded the far turn at the rail but was caught mid-stretch and flattened stride, though, held on for
second. CAYENNE CREEK rated off the pace toward the inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, finished well and was
gaining on the runner-up. OUT OF CENTS settled off the pace about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path
and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. AWSOME FAITH settled off the pace in the four and five paths, picked up the chase leaving the half mile
pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then flattened the final sixteenth. ELLIE'S LIL MAN rated off the pace about the three path, bid nearing the three
eighths pole then flattened in the four path of the far turn. BUFF'S EYE VIEW raced outside and showed only mild response. CHARITABLE SPENNY was
hustled to the lead and angled to the inside to set the pace, gave up the nod into the backstretch, gave chase from that point then faded at the rail on the far
turn.

SWORD pressured the early pace, raced off the rail on the turn and finished well to close the gap. DISTANT THUNDER chased, rounded the turn about the
three path then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. QUAD EIGHTS was kept off the pace through the backstretch, bid nearing the quarter pole, improved his
position in the four path of the turn and finished well. CHURCH OF MANY chased toward the inside, ran at the rail on the turn then flattened inside the
eighth pole. THEHEATOFTHENIGHT chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened. TRUTH SERUM gave chase off the rail, ran two deep on
the turn then weakened. DEO FORTE was not a factor. TRUE CROSSING steadied on the chute then gave chase to no avail. YOUREOUTOFCONTROL
