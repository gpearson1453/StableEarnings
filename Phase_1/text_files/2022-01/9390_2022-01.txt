Footnotes
BUBBA DREAMS broke readily to gain terms with a rival on the lead racing to the chute, was eased just off the leaders approaching the turn, steadily
advanced three wide racing into upper stretch to wrest the advantage leaving the furlong marker, went clear under right handed pressure and was taken in
hand nearing the wire with the issue decided. TONE ELISE tracked the leader outside rivals in the opening stages, angled to the rail racing into the turn,
tipped outside foes entering upper stretch and continued with interest to prove best of the others. TAP FIRST, urged to dispute the pace from the outset
racing a bit off the rail to the turn, shifted to the inside dueling inside the eventual winner into upper stretch but yielded to the top pair nearing the sixteenth
marker. GUS K settled last along the inside on the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. SUMMER BOSS was urged along the rail prompting the
pacesetter in the opening half, then gave way nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
GOLDEN GLIDER was away last while breaking a bit awkwardly, was reserved between foes to the first turn, then along the inside racing through the
backstretch, swung out sharply to race four wide through the far turn, rallied to the front in that path racing to upper stretch and went clear under firm right
handed encouragement. BOITANO broke sharply, was urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, dueled inside foes
with a grudging effort to upper stretch, couldn't match the winner in the drive but kept on well enough to prevail for the place honors. TRIGGER HAPPY
tracked off the first flight outside rivals to the first turn, was prompted to advance three wide between foes entering the turn, dueled in that path to upper
stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. CLOUD PLAY was prompted to a forward placing racing to the first turn, attended a rival's pace under rating to the
backstretch, was urged to press the issue between foes into the far turn but faded in the drive. KISS PRINCIPAL tracked just off the pacesetter inside rivals
racing to the first turn, was prompted to make some brief progress nearing the far turn but gave way approaching the stretch.

COMMANDER KEITH, urged between foes prompting the pace from the outset to the half mile marker, dropped back off the leaders racing into the second
bend, but responded to steady pressure to produce a second effort racing into upper stretch while shifting out three wide and just edged SUPER SHOES in
time under some right handed encouragement. SUPER SHOES was urged to terms with the first flight four wide racing into the first turn, pressed the issue
in that path nearing the second bend, shifted inwards while moving to gain a narrow advantage with a quarter mile to go, maintained the advantage in a
prolonged drive past midstretch but couldn't fend off the winner. GIOVANE'S PROMISE was urged inside foes disputing the pace a bit off the rail racing into
the first turn, gained a narrow advantage racing through the backstretch, dueled for command in a protracted skirmish into upper stretch but yielded to the
top pair late. BEACH BANDIT was urged to terms with the first flight three wide between foes racing to the backstrech pressing the issue, lost ground to the
leaders nearing the second bend and emptied out approaching upper stretch. BYRON'S GOLD, off last, angled to the inside early, was urged along the rail
pursuing the leaders into the backstretch briefly drawing on terms inside the pacesetter after the opening quarter but dropped back early. THE RACE WAS
DELAYED WHEN RED DUBONNET DISLODGED HIS RIDER TWICE IN THE POST PARADE, SUBSEQUENTLY DELAYING THE START AS THE
AMBULANCE CREW ATTENDED TO THE INJURED RIDER AND WAS SUBSEQUENTLY SCRATCHED BY THE STEWARDS.

deep between foes racing to the first turn, tracked the pacesetter outside a rival through the backstretch, shifted three deep nearing upper stretch to bid for
command between foes but proved only second best. SUPER EDGAR, urged to terms with the leaders between rivals from the break, was taken up
avoiding tight quarters nearing the first turn, pulled hard against firm restraint while racing in close quarters along the inside to the backstretch, tipped out
nearing the far turn to wrest the advantage on the second bend, dueled inside the top pair remaining well off the rail into upper stretch but gave out nearing
the sixteenth marker. STAGE DOOR tracked just off the second flight three wide to the first turn, continued between foes through the backstretch and raced
evenly into the lane. DOHKO was hustled to the lead from between foes, then angled sharply to the rail entering the first turn, set the pace along the inside
racing to the far turn and emptied out into the lane. KATHERN'S JOY was settled outside foes racing four wide into the backstretch and steadily faded after
a half. VIGO broke readily to briefly contest the issue inside foes in the opening sixteenth, was held up avoiding tight quarters nearing the first turn, saved
ground to he backstretch but offered no rally.

Footnotes
MICROPHONE (IRE) was prompted between foes leaving the chute to gain a position leading the second flight, continued under light rating conceding
ground to the pacesetter to the backstretch, responded when given his cue leaving the midway point of the far turn to reel in the leader leaving midstretch
and was taken in hand while his rider confirmed the race was decided to prevail in a ridden out performance. HARPOON HARRY sprinted clear of the field
racing to the backstretch, held sway on a commanding margin to upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner while holding for
second. KANAAN was rated behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, swung outside foes to race in the four path nearing upper stretch and
continued to make solid progress late while being outkicked for second. LE COSTE tracked the pacesetter inside foes as part of the second flight racing to
the backstretch and steadily faded entering the far turn. NINTH OF APRIL tracked the pacesetter three deep in second flight racing to the backstretch and
gave way between foes racing into the far turn. TARAASHOQ, a bit rank in the post parade, was settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and proved
no threat.

Footnotes
ATLANTIC PRINCESS bobbled while shifting inwards bumping SUNDRENCHED at the start, was righted to track off the leaders between foes on the
backstretch, shifted out three wide while steadily advancing on the pacesetter nearing upper stretch, took over from that foe entering the lane, went clear
under pressure, then was taken in hand nearing the wire. TALE OF V K angled inwards in the opening stages to force the pace outside a rival on the
backstretch, went clear racing into the turn, shifted well off the inside while being roused to resist the winner's bid but couldn't match that foe while prevailing
for the place honors. ORNERY ANGEL tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight, was prompted to advance four wide into upper stretch and edged a
rival for a share in an even effort. FUN PADDY settled last in early stages, angled to the inside racing into the turn, then continued with interest inside foes
to late stages while continuing to improve position. SALSA RITA, brushed at the start, was urged inside a rival disputing the pace in the opening quarter,
switched outside the leader entering the turn to pursue that rival between foes to upper stretch but gave way in the drive. SUNDRENCHED, bumped, then
squeezed back at the start, trailed throughout.

MARV'S MAGIC, reserved between foes behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide racing into the far turn while being
prompted to advance and made a steady rally in that path to go clear in late stages under firm handling. VINTNER, caught five wide while being prompted to
a forward placing racing to the first turn, angled inwards conceding some position to track off the second flight between foes on the backstretch, angled out
five wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to edge a rival for the place honors nearing the wire. INITFORTHELOVE was rated off the
first flight along the inside to the backstretch, tipped out after a half to race between rivals into the far turn, awaited an opening under patient handling racing
into upper stretch, altered course midstretch to advance four wide between foes and continued willingly while exchanging some contact with JO JO KATZ
when racing in close quarters in the final sixteenth. CLEMSON TIGER was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the first turn, advanced along
the rail when presented an opening on the backstretch to gain a position just off the pacesetter entering the far turn, came through inside that foe to
challenge racing into the lane but lacked the needed final kick. JO JO KATZ, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground while
steadying a bit avoiding close quarters on the far turn, was blocked inside rivals racing into upper stretch, switched out to bid between foes in the closing
stages but was steadied a bit while exchanging bumps and racing in tight quarters approaching the wire. HIGHLY NOTED was urged clear racing to the
backstretch, dueled inside rivals on a narrow advantage through the far turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch and gave way between foes leaving the
furlong marker. GOLOVKIN shifted inwards racing to the firstr turn to track the pacesetter three wide between foes to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance in tandem with several rivals to lodge a brief bid in that path racing into the far turn but flattened entering the stretch. LION CHARMER shifted

Footnotes
NANTUCKETER took up a position between foes racing behind the first flight through the backstretch, steadily drew into striking position between foes
under patient handling racing through the turn, swung out six wide entering upper stretch while being roused to challenge, then wrested the advantage
midstretch and went clear under firm encouragement. UNIQUE PATH, a bit reluctant to load, was outpaced in the opening stages, switched off the inside
racing into the turn gradually gathering momentum, angled five deep nearing the lane to bid between foes nearing midstretch but proved only second best.
NEPTUNES REVENGE, urged three wide between foes disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, shifted inwards disputing the issue inside the
winner to midstretch but weakened late while just lasting for a share. ROYAL BIZ tracked off the first flight inside foes racing into the turn, continued in hand
awaiting an opening nearing upper stretch, switched out four wide in upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. CARROTS OR CARATS
was urged from the break dueling for command inside foes racing into the turn and gave way entering the stretch. ORULA joined the pace four wide in the
opening stages, pressed the issue in that path through the turn into upper stretch and abruptly gave out leaving the furlong marker. NO EASY ROAD, urged
between foes from the outset disputing the pace into the turn, gave out in upper stretch. KAPHAVATA tracked off the first flight racing four, then five wide
into the turn, was fanned wide racing into the lane and quickly dropped out. JERICHOS BATTLE swerved out at the start, was righted quickly, then urged
along five wide pursuing the leaders into the turn and gave out abruptly after a half.

off the first flight while angling to the inside racing to the turn, advanced along the rail to challenge for command inside the pacesetter nearing midstretch,
wrested the advantage from that foe between calls late but just failed to contain the winner. T. WALTZ tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening
stages, angled to the rail entering the turn to advance just behind MONEY AND HONEY racing into upper stretch, then tipped out to advance between foes

the pace through the backstretch, went clear racing into the bend, shifted out racing into upper stretch while holding sway past the furlong marker but
