Footnotes
EASY IVY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up four-wide to take command nearing the quarter and drew off as a handy winner. INDIAN
AFFAIR sprinted clear soon after the start, responded when challenged nearing the quarter, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well to
hold the place. ASEAAWINNER stalked the pace of INDIAN AFFAIR while racing three-wide, moved up in tandem with the winner to offer a bid nearing the
quarter and gave way in the drive. TOSSAPENNYDOWN showed brief speed, raced four-wide through the turn and weakened. KNOCKON was off a step
slow, lacked early foot, raced from off the rail through the turn and failed to menace. BLUEGRASS RUN raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the turn and weakened.

RAMBLIN' MAN raced unhurried early, advanced four-wide to take command nearing the three-eighths marker, opened a clear lead and held sway to the
wire. EL CHAVO DEL OCHO was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not reach the winner in the drive but finished
with good energy. SHARP DRESSED BEAU settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. STACKIN
SILVER disputed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half. ELLIOTT BAY was off a step slow then allowed to settle, raced
three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CAPTAIN SCOTTY was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside and weakened after going
three-eighths.

SILENT MUSKETIER settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore into the lane and drew off with something left.
WILLTOBELUCKY was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive, could not gain on the winner but finished well to hold the
place. CRYPTO GOLD showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, checked nearing the quarter, angled out in mid-stretch and
finished with late interest. HAVEULOSTYOURMIND sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way after going three-quarters.
MUSKYMAN chased the leaders while racing three-wide, angled out into the stretch and weakened. JU JU GUY was void of early speed, saved ground
throughout and did not menace. AUTISM SIBLINGS chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.

BOY BOB was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. HARROVIAN was forwardly
placed early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached a striking position but failed to gain in the drive. DIIACHI was void of early speed, raced five-wide
through the turn and finished evenly late. J SERINO disputed the pace from the inside, angled out nearing the three-eighths pole and weakened. I AM

Footnotes
EXETER was carried out through the first turn, dueled for the early advantage, opened a clear margin nearing the seven-sixteenths pole and drew off with
complete authority. WHO'S CHEATIN WHO settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy.
INFATUATE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, reached a striking position into the lane but lacked the needed closing
response. BACK ALLEY CAT was void of early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with some late run.
ABANDONED disputed the pace from the inside, dropped back inside the three-quarter marker, reached a contending position but failed to gain in the drive.
FULL VELOCITY was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. OFF THE BOOKS was void of early speed, raced
three-wide through the second turn and did not menace. BALIUS lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid.
ACHILLEUS was off slow, lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and failed to threaten. AGUA DORADO chased the leaders while
racing five-wide and weakened after going six furlongs. FISHIN THE RIVER lugged out through the first turn, steadied nearing the five-sixteenths pole and
weakened.
