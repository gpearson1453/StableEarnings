the three path, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn three wide, dug in from the eighth pole and dueled through the final sixteenth for
second. SECRET CASTLE rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail toward the five sixteenths,
raced at the rail on the far turn and was outfinished for second the final sixteenth. SHERWOOD LADY stalked two deep, picked up the chase from the three

IMPETUOUS pressured the pace inside and raced at even terms nearest the rail on the turn, took the nod toward the head of the lane, ran clear past the
eighth pole and held on under steady encouragement. SOMERSET BAY chased through the backstretch, ran in the three path of the turn, dug in from the
eighth pole for a clear second mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner. SILVER CASTLE chased outside, rounded the turn in the four path, angled to the
outside entering the stretch and finished well while gaining on the top two. BUCKED TOOTH gave chase, ran in the three path of the turn and finished
evenly. WON DOZEN BANKS gave chase, rounded the turn about the five path and finished evenly. CASTLE FIVE set a pressured pace, was met and
dueled at even terms two deep on the turn, gave up the nod nearing the head of the lane, dropped back at the eighth pole and weakened. UNION GRACE
gave chase, ran in the three path of the turn and showed little more. SINGANOTHERSONG was crowded early and never factored. BEARCAT KITTEN

NO CHANGE settled off the pace and off the rail, started a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, dueled to the
lead past the eighth pole and dug in under steady encouragement to hold on. YOUTHINKTHATSFUNNY stalked from the three path then bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, dueled to the lead two deep midway on the far turn, was caught leaving the eighth pole but stayed on gamely. SAVATIANO saved
ground off the pace, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, ran through the far turn about the four path, dug in the final furlong and finished
well while gaining on the top two. TAPPING THE GLASS broke a bit awkwardly then settled off the pace in the two and three paths, gave chase from the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and finished evenly. SCOTTSDALE set a clear pace inside, came under pressure nearing the three
eighths pole, was caught at the rail midway on the far turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. BOBBYFROMTHEPALM settled back in the three path the
first turn, eased to the outside into the backstretch and picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn but showed
little more. TITAN'S WILL stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch but faded on the far turn. SING A VERSE was not a factor.

Footnotes
STORM BOARDER (CHI) was hustled along while tapering in and set a pressured pace, drew clear and angled to the rail past the quarter pole, widened
through the turn and was steadily handled down the lane. INSPIRING JUSTICE gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path, dug in from the head of
the lane and just lasted in second. I GOT A ROCK gave chase, rounded the turn in the three path, dug in through the final furlong and just missed second.
UNNAMED SOLDIER gave chase, ran through the turn in the five path and finished evenly outside. MOSS BOSS chased, raced off the rail on the turn and
ran evenly down the lane. KUKULKAN gave chase toward the inside, raced at the rail on the turn then weakened. FREEDOM IS RINGING chased, ran near
the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane. ZAINO BOYZ pressured the pace inside, dropped back at the quarter pole, ran at the rail on the turn but
drifted toward the eighth pole and weakened. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
CASTLE BOUND saved ground off the pace on the opening turn, picked up the chase from the half mile pole, improved in the three path of the far turn, dug
in through the final furlong and got up the final strides. OWEN'S WAY rated close two deep the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the
lead at the rail approaching the quarter, ran clear midway on the far turn, widened toward the head of the lane, dug in under steady encouragement but was
caught in the final strides. JACOB T exchanged contact with Chesapeake Charlie leaving the gate and was hustled along inside, took the lead at the rail into
the first turn and showed the way with a slim lead, dug in to the challenge of True Crossing leaving the half mile pole but was steadied in tight quarters
leaving the five sixteenths, rounded the turn off the rail and flattened stride. CHARITABLE VISIT rated close inside, picked up the chase from the three
eighths pole, was pinched back in the five path past the quarter pole, though, came back to finish well. TWOBITSARIDE broke a bit awkwardly, rounded the
opening turn about the four path, bid from the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the six path of the far turn but showed little more. NAZCA MYSTERY stalked
from the three and four paths, came in a path leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced close in the three path of the far turn then weakened the final furlong.
CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE exchanged contact with Jacob T leaving the gate then settled back about the three path the first turn, showed only mild response
through the backstretch then steadied off the heels of True Crossing and angled to the outside on the far turn. TRUE CROSSING tapered in to stalk two
deep into the first turn, challenged into the backstretch, was pinched back past the five sixteenths pole, faded then checked at the heels of Castle Bound
midway on the far turn.
