Footnotes
STARSHIP NEBULA got in tight two wide in early stages and checked sharply, got bumped between rivals and checked again shortly after, weakened then
ranged back up and sat patiently inside late on the turn, tipped two wide at the head of the lane, responded under a strong hand ride, swept by near
mid-stretch and finished in hand. MATCHA raced off the early pace, was ridden along two to three wide through the turn, sustained a three wide bid into the
lane, steadily edged up closer and gained place. I LOVE MAGEL was off slow at the start, remained reserved in the back, saved ground around the turn,
came out a path in the upper stretch, stayed on with response and got up late for show. MAMA LONGLEGS sped to the lead soon after the start, set the
pace and held firm around the turn, got collared by the winner near mid-stretch and gave way. SENORITA SALSA raced three to four wide near midpack
around the turn, fanned out wide into stretch run and needed more for late impact. NAKED TACO raced up close along the rail and bumped with the winner
late on the backstretch, remained forwardly placed through the turn, came four wide into the lane, remained in the mix but lacked late kick and drifted out
approaching the wire. PRINCESS TERESKA bumped with the winner late on the backstretch, chased two wise between foes around the turn, flattened out
in the stretch and steadied when NAKED TACO drifted out approaching the wire. LOOKING FOR LOVE chased in contention around the turn and
weakened in the upper stretch.

MALIBU MAX through the final sixteenth and dug in gamely to prevail. MALIBU MAX hit the starting gate, tracked the pace four wide, bid in upper stretch,
vied outside of the winner through the final furlong, was hand urged through the final sixteenth and just missed. LONG BEACH KID was in range inside,
came through inside of the pacesetter in upper stretch, bid at the rail nearing the eighth pole, brushed with DIZZY GILLESPIE near the sixteenth marker and
was outkicked. DIZZY GILLESPIE set the pace in the two path, was collared in upper stretch, fought on between foes, brushed with LONG BEACH KID
near the sixteenth pole and was outfinished for the minor awards. COUNTY COURT had his head turned at the start, raced four wide and never threatened.
IL FARAONE trailed inside.

Footnotes
FAVOR tracked from easy striking range early, advanced rapidly midway on the turn, overpowered FULTON MARKET coming to the quarter-pole, entered
the stretch in the five-path and widened while drifting out steadily. LAKOTA SPIRIT saved ground up the backstretch, came under a ride on the turn shifting
out to wind up in the six-path at the top of the lane, moved back inward staying on her left lead and went clear of the rest. CATICHE bumped with FULTON
MARKET at the start, pursued the pacesetter early, was put to a drive on the turn two to three wide, made no progress and ran on well ahead of the
remainder. FULTON MARKET bumped with CATICHE at the start, made the pace removed from the rail, proved no match for FAVOR after six furlongs, and
gave way. SOUL OF AN ANGEL showed little toward the inside. BELLA CASCATA lunged at the break and was off slowly, and never reached contention.
STORY HOUR broke awkwardly with the rider losing the left iron, dropped far back after a half-mile, was pulled up in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
ASK FOR BODE was forwardly placed positioned just off the leader in opening stages, moved up two wide to challenge KING TARZAN for the lead at the
quarter pole, cleared on top entering the stretch run, widened advantage under pressure and remained clear. BRONX raced four wide in contention through
early stages, hustled up three to four wide around the turn, stayed on with response along the outside in the stretch run and cleared second best. KING
TARZAN broke in and sped to the lead shortly after the start, showed the way into the turn, held a slim lead over eventual winner at the quarter pole, got
collared in the upper stretch and weakened to show. SIXTY ONE raced off the early pace and saved ground, shifted out late on the turn, hustled up four to
five wide into the upper stretch and had a mild improve. POLITICAL RIOT was ridden along in range around the turn, stayed on two to three wide into the
upper stretch and flattened near the furlong marker. I TURN A NIGHT UP chased in contention and saved ground around the turn, cut the corner entering
the lane and gave way. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

Footnotes
LORD OF WAR set the pace along the rail, shook clear while drifting out a bit in upper stretch and held firm between a wall of late challengers. DEEP
STATE was in range three wide between foes, angled six wide in upper stretch, rallied widest and narrowly outfinished several foes for the place.
NEPOTISM prompted the winner two wide between foes, dropped back two wide between around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and re-rallied
between foes. JERRY'S TURN bumped with SANCTIFIED approaching the first turn, raced off the pace three wide around that turn, went two wide between
around the far turn, angled in in midstretch and rallied inside of the winner to just miss second and third. ARUBA tracked the pace from the rail, had clear
sailing inside of foes in the lane but was one-paced through the stretch. KHAFRE was a bit rank while racing four wide around the first turn, bid four deep
around the far turn, reached near even terms outside of the winner turning for home, could not quite match strides with that foe and was outfinished between
foes for the minor awards. SANCTIFIED bumped with JERRY'S TURN approaching the first turn, raced off the pace five wide around that bend, went four
wide around the far turn and never threatened. AMERICAN TRYST was outrun while racing two and three wide. FREE SHIPPING lost contact around the
far turn and was eased.

Footnotes
STEEL CITY DUDE received a bump from JUST SO YA KNOW at the start, went along in striking range early, lodged a three-wide bid after six furlongs,
dueled outside BORN A GAMBLER through the stretch and edged away in the closing yards. BORN A GAMBLER took over and went clear up the
backstretch, dug in when challenged by STEEL CITY DUDE approaching the stretch, dueled inside that rival and yielded grudgingly late. CADET CORPS
bumped with EMIGRANTEDESILLUSO shortly after the start, raced two wide in the second flight to the stretch, moved out and offered a mild response to
go clear of the rest. SUN VIKING bumped with RHYMES LIKE DIMES at the start, came under a ride on the far turn three then four wide, and faded in the
stretch. EMIGRANTEDESILLUSO bobbled at the break, then bumped with CADET CORPS a couple strides later, led early before relinquishing the front to
BORN A GAMBLER, stayed on the chase to late on the far turn, and tired. JUST SO YA KNOW broke in, bumped STEEL CITY DUDE and took the worst of
it, and never got close. RHYMES LIKE DIMES bumped with SUN VIKING at the start, saved ground and tired before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
STELLAR RIDE sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set the pace and saved ground around the turn, came under attack from VETERANS HIGHWAY
turning for home, dug in gamely, turned back bid from aforementioned rival and held firm. VETERANS HIGHWAY raced two wide in pursuit heading into the
turn, moved up to threaten STELLAR RIDE turning for home, remained in striking distance two wide through the lane and lasted for place. CUSTOMER
DRIVEN raced in the last flight, picked up the pace late on the turn, came two wide into the upper stretch, tipped out wider in the final furlong, finished with
response and just missed place. WALKATHON raced off the early pace, ranged up closer and steadied approaching the quarter pole, dropped to the rail
leaving the turn, took closer order then finished evenly and lost show. LAY THE GROUNDWORK raced near midpack three to four wide around the turn,
came out five wide into the lane and had no late kick. MANDORLA tracked in contention through early stages, was ridden along three wide through the turn
and flattened out in the stretch run. I CROSS MY HEART raced in the last flight, fanned wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. OMIXOCHITL was
ridden along the outside in early stages, fanned out six wide into the upper stretch and had no late response. FROZEN SOLID angled to the inside soon
after the start, raced off the early pace, came three to four wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. IT'S NORA NOW chased in close contention in
opening stages, continued bid into the turn, then came up empty past the quarter pole and faded. OAXACA showed response along the inside in early
stages, lost position around the turn and steadily retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
SMOKIN RICHIE pressed DR. DUKE from outside, wrested command after straightening away for the drive and pulled clear, then kept EAMONN at a safe
distance late. EAMONN broke a step slow and was outsprinted early, shifted out four wide approaching the stretch, and finished well on the far outside to be
clearly second best. DR. DUKE set a pressured pace inside, could not handle SMOKIN RICHIE approaching the furlong grounds, and saved the show.
READYFORPRIMETIME chased three to four wide for three-eighths of a mile, weakened through the late stages, and was vanned off after the finish.
LIVING VICARIOUSLY saved ground close up for three furlongs, and tired in the stretch. WICKED FINN broke a bit slowly, raced three to four wide and
failed to factor. KITTEN STREET was outrun through an inside trip.

Footnotes
PRINCESS BLAKELY settled three to four wide around the first turn, rated outside near midpack up the backstretch, loomed up four wide late on the far
turn, dueled outside of SWOONATRA into the stretch run, edged by to a slim lead and held late under a driving finish. UNCAPTURED GRACE raced four to
five wide entering the first turn, was allowed to settle outside up the backstretch, picked up the pace four wide late on the far turn, steadily edged up closer
through the lane and captured place. WINTOUR raced two wide into the first turn, rated between foes through early stages, launched a bid leaving the far
turn, came out five to six wide, responded under pressure in the upper stretch and just missed place. SWOONATRA made a move nearing the mid-way
point up the backstretch, vied for the lead around the far turn, dueled inside of the winner into upper stretch and weakened late. TICKET TO HEAVEN was
in a bit tight along the rail around the first turn, moved up between foes to race in striking distance mid-way through the backstretch, weakened and lost
position, launched a four wide rebid entering the lane and lacked the needed response for late impact. CALIFORNIA GIGI settled off the pace entering the
backstretch, remained unhurried up the backstretch, was ridden along two wide into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. LONDON LADY secured
inside position around the first turn, raced in range up the backstretch, tipped out a path wider midway through the far turn and gave way. HARD TO
IGNORE was a bit headstrong and steadied in the first turn, was not too far back between foes in early stages then dropped to last, was ridden along the
outside into stretch run and never threatened. I SAID HEY was forwardly placed around the first turn, moved up in the early backstretch and vied for the
lead, dueled around the far turn and faded turning for home. PRESSLY'S HOPE led the way around the first turn, dueled up the backstretch and around the
far turn, then tired in the drive. FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE, RACE WAS HAND TIMED
