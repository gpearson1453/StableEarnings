Footnotes
WHISTLE ME HOME was reserved while guided inside racing to the first turn dropping well off the leaders, gathered momentum while shifting off the inside
nearing the second bend, swung out four wide midway through the far turn, rallied to join the leaders in that path racing past midstretch and edged away late
under firm left handed encouragement. GO TIME tracked just off the leaders while angling nearer the inside racing to the first turn, was prompted to
advance nearing upper stretch splitting foes just off the inside, then bid inside the leaders midstretch but proved only second best. CHINOMADITO was
rated off the first flight outside a rival racing to the first turn, split foes three deep entering the backstretch to close the gap on the leader, took over from that
foe racing into the second bend, held sway to upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum. PHILO, caught four wide racing into the first turn while
under some prompting to maintain striking distance, dropped off the first flight on the backstretch, then continued evenly three deep between foes into the
lane. PICCADILLY BEAU was settled outside the eventual winner dropping well off the leaders racing to the first turn and offered no rally. MITZRAYIM,
urged dictating the pace a bit off the rail from the outset to the backstretch, gave way once headed racing into the far turn. BETTING ON RED, forwardly
placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, continued in pursuit of the leader into the far turn, but steadily faded nearing upper
stretch.

Footnotes
NIGHT CAP ducked outwards at the start, was quickly collected to race just off the leaders four wide through the backstretch, was prompted to advance in
that path entering the turn, gained terms with a rival in upper stretch, then continued with a grudging effort in a protracted skirmish to wrest the advantage in
time under firm handling. BEAUTIFUL GRACE broke readily to join the pace three deep in the opening stages, conceded some position to a rival midway
through the backstretch, advanced readily when given her cue to bid three deep between foes nearing upper stretch, then gamely contested the issue inside
the winner to late stages but just failed to contain that foe. PINK SHOELACES urged to a forward placing along the rail, tracked just off the pacesetter inside
foes racing into the bend, came through inside the leader to challenge for command in tandem with several rivals nearing upper stretch but weakened in the
drive when failing to match the top pair. SPLASH CASH, urged between foes contesting the pace, edged away to a narrow advantage after the opening
furlong, set the pace off the inside racing into the turn and gave way once headed after a half. RAY AREWETHEREYET angled inwards tracking just off the
leaders on the backstretch but emptied out early. ABOVE PAR, off a beat slowly, then held up momentarily avoiding tight quarters at the break, continued
under rating in the opening stages and never gained contention.

MORE CHANCES, pulling against restraint while switching off the inside racing to the first turn, shifted out three wide nearing the backstretch while
continuing to pull a bit racing just off the pacesetter, moved to press the leaders three wide racing into the far turn, continued to dispute the issue outside a
rival into upper stretch and edged forward in the final stages under pressure. AND THE OSCAR GOES, reserved well off the leaders racing to the first turn,
was prompted to gain some position between rivals after a half, steadily gained contention just off the inside racing through the far turn, tipped out three
wide racing through the stretch and finished with interest to close the gap while edging a rival for the place honors. HIGHJUMP CHARLIE, urged to the lead
from the break while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, dueled for command inside foes through the far turn
into upper stretch but weakened when failing to match the winner late. RAL COPPERHEADROAD, was urged to a forward placing while angling inwards
racing into the first turn, prompted the leader through the backstretch, was urged to press the issue between foes into the far turn and gave way nearing
upper stretch. ZAGREB hopped at the start while breaking slowly, settled outside a rival to the backstretch, then passed some tiring rivals in the closing
stages. HEAVEN'S TALE tracked off the first flight racing three wide to the backstretch, came under pressure early but soon faded. BUSTER, reluctant to
load, was settled into stride along the inside early and proved no threat. MERCEDES JOE angled to the inside early while being prompted to a position
tracking just off the pacesetter but emptied out abruptly racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
SHINBORO raced outside foes just off the second flight on the backstretch, was prompted to advance three deep nearing the turn, dropped back midway
through the bend, then found a solid closing response entering the lane to split foes three wide and wrest a clear advantage in time under firm handling.
KNIGHT OFTHE CROWN angled inwards racing through the backstretch while being urged to prompt a rival's pace, edged forward racing into upper stretch
but proved no match when confronted by the winner. PAYITO, prompted to a forward placing between foes while pulling a bit against rating, shifted inwards
racing past the half mile marker exchanging contact with BALI BEACH, was urged to advance between foes into the stretch, lost some momentum when
racing in tight quarters midstretch and lacked the needed final kick. RUNAWAY TOM urged between foes to gain the advantage a bit off the inside in the
opening stages, angled inwards disputing the pace inside a rival racing through the turn and gave way entering the lane. THEJIGISUP, caught in tight
quarters, then held up just after the start, switched out five wide racing through the backstretch while being prompted to contend but steadily faded into the
stretch. CEDAR BEACH tracked off the second flight inside rivals racing to the turn, swung out five wide entering the lane but offered no rally. BALI BEACH
angled inwards while prompted to a forward placing just inside the pacesetter, raced in tight quarters while exchanging some contact with PAYITO nearing
the turn and steadily faded into the lane. MOON SECRET was away very slowly and failed to menace thereafter.

Footnotes
SECRETIVE MISS, unhurried along the rail racing off the first flight into the first turn, tracked just off the leaders inside a rival on the backstretch, shifted out
racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance, moved to challenge three wide in upper stretch and kicked away late under pressure. AMAZING
MSKITTY settled outside foes dropping well off the leaders to the backstretch, angled to the rail racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance,
saved ground to upper stretch and came through inside foes to prevail for the place honors late. BRASS BAND, urged along the inside prompting the pace
into the backstretch, lost some ground to the leader racing into the far turn, tipped out to the three path in the closing stages and finished evenly late while
edging a rival for a share. JUDGE JUDITH, urged three wide into the first turn prompting the pace, took over racing through the far turn, went clear while
angling inwards racing into upper stretch but failed to sustain her momentum past midstretch. BELLAVALENCIA tracked off the second flight under rating to
the backstretch, was prompted to advance inside foes on the far turn, steadied, then altered course avoiding tight quarters racing into upper stretch, shifted
four wide in the closing stages but had no final response. MISS LADY L settled between foes to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into the lane but
lacked the needed final kick. A TOUCH OF SPADGET settled last along the inside racing to the backstretch and passed only tiring rivals. BUFFALO
DANCER tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight in the opening half but steadily faded racing into the far turn. VEGAS SLIPPERS,
urged between foes racing to the first turn pressing the pace, dueled inside a rival into the far turn and gave way abruptly midway through the second bend.
DIAMOND ROCK made brief pursuit of the leaders three deep into the first turn but dropped out early.

Footnotes
TRIPULANTE, prominent between foes from the outset, was urged to shake clear of the field while angling to the inside nearing the half mile marker, held
sway on a commanding advantage a bit off the rail into upper stretch and was kept to firm right handed pressure to hold safe the challenge of CASHIER
CHECK to the end. The latter was urged inside rivals prompting the pacesetter through the opening three sixteenths, lost ground to that foe racing into the
turn, but continued willingly along the inside to bid inside the winner nearing the wire while only second best. SHED A TEAR was rated off the second flight
three wide in early stages, angled to the rail racing into the turn and continued with a steady effort to improve position while no match for the top pair. JUST
PLAIN ORNERY tracked just off the leaders racing four wide into the turn and faded in the drive. OVER IT was settled between foes in the opening quarter,
and passed between tiring rivals in late stages. ONWARD AUSTIN, prompted to contend between foes in the opening stages, dropped off the first flight to
track the leaders along the inside and gave way racing into the turn. VOLBEAT, urged to a forward placing three deep in the opening stages, tracked
pacesetter outside a rival racing to the turn and emptied out nearing upper stretch. LAYNES KNIGHT was rated in the last flight between foes in the opening
stages but dropped out early.

Footnotes
WICKED MIAH shifted inwards racing to the first turn to gain a position between foes just off the leaders, pulled a bit against light rating racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to maintain striking distance nearing the second bend, responded nearing the lane to advance three wide on the pacesetter,
shifted inwards to dispute the issue outside a rival past the furlong marker but edged forward in time to prevail under firm handling. SIP'N DIP settled
between rivals dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance splitting foes leaving the midway point of the far turn,
angled to the rail to bid for command racing into the stretch but was just outkicked. NANCY WORK, prompted to terms with the leaders racing to the first
turn, tipped outside a rival to race just off the pacesetter on the backstretch, readily advanced to gain the advantage racing through the far turn, briefly
disputed the issue between the top pair into upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. ROSE E HOLIDAY was settled last while guided with a sharp
move to the inside racing to the first turn, tipped out on the far turn, then split foes racing through the stretch while shifting out four wide late to gain some
position. TAKE ME AS I AM broke sharply, raced three wide between foes tracking the leaders as part of the second flight to the far turn but couldn't the
needed produce closing bid. CHARGE IT JENN tracked just off the leaders along the rail in the opening half, was prompted to advance entering the far turn,
but lost momentum when caught in tight quarters nearing upper stretch and was shuffled back into the lane. TEGLA tracked off the second flight along the
inside to the backstretch but came up empty racing into the far turn. WHISTLER DIXIE, urged between foes to go clear a bit off the rail racing into the
backstretch, emptied out entering the far turn. SPEAK ENGLISH, caught four wide while prompted to terms with the second flight racing to the backstretch,
dropped back early.

Footnotes
DENY broke readily to gain the advantage racing in the four path past the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin in the three path to the turn, widened
the advantage in that path racing into upper stretch and was kept to firm left handed pressure, then taken in hand late while drawing well clear. THE BEAST
GOES ON, a bit outpaced along the inside in the opening stages, tipped off the inside splitting foes racing into the bend, shifted out four wide racing into
upper stretch and continued with a steady late effort to prevail for the place honors in time. GIVE ME TWO STEPS tracked the leaders between foes in
second flight racing into the bend, shifted inwards on the turn while being prompted to advance, gained some position between foes while appearing to shy
from a rival's whip midstretch but kept on well enough to earn a share while missing for the place honors. SIAKAM was rated off the second flight outside
foes racing through the backstretch, then continued with an even effort three deep into the stretch while just missing for a share. LIL BULL, urged to forward
placing while angling to the inside racing through the backstretch, continued in pursuit of the eventual winner to upper stretch but gave out in the drive.
GOLD DUCAT tracked off the first flight along the inside through the backstretch but faded early. IRISH MAIL raced widest in the last flight to the turn and
dropped out early. STAR DEPUTY tracked off the second flight three deep between foe on the backstretch and dropped out early. TIZ TRIUMPHANT
shifted out three wide early while being prompted to contend in second flight but gave way abruptly racing into the turn.

Footnotes
DR KAAK was settled last racing a bit off the inside in the opening quarter, tipped out four wide on the backstretch, then was prompted to advance in that
path after a half, was bumped while being carried out five wide by PEACELOVENKARMA nearing the second bend, was eased back from the position
conceding some ground entering the far turn, angled to the rail nearing upper stretch, then produced a steady rally to wrest the advantage in the closing
stages under firm right handed encouragement. ASTERS D'ORO broke readily to gain the advantage racing to the first turn, was headed nearing the
backstretch, prompted the pace outside a rival to the second bend, went clear racing into the far turn, held sway a bit off the rail racing into upper stretch but
couldn't fend off the winner. ASPROPODIA, urged in pursuit of the leaders four wide racing into the first turn, shifted inwards after a half, was prompted to
advance on the leader three wide into the second bend, couldn't match the top pair in the drive but edged a rival for a share. PEACELOVENKARMA, urged
to a forward placing three wide between racing into the first turn, was eased back from that position entering the backstretch, switched out while being urged
to advance in tandem with the eventual winner after a half making repeated contact with that foe nearing the second bend, continued four wide into the
stretch and was outfinished for a share under tepid handling late. THEUNCAPTUREDLADY angled inwards tracking off the first flight racing to the
backstretch but offered no closing bid. SIDNEY SUE was urged along the rail into the first turn to dispute the pace inside a rival, couldn't match that foe and
gave way racing into the far turn.
