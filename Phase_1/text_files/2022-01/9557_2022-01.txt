Footnotes
APRIORITY LADY vied in the five path around the first turn, led two wide passing the three quarter pole, showed the way before being headed by an outer
APHRODITES REVENGE at the five sixteenths pole, then fought on through the lane to regain an advantage from her wandering counterpart at the
sixteenth pole. APHRODITES REVENGE broke inwardly at the start forcing a rival into others, tracked from the three to two path around the first turn,
inched closer before tipping outside of the leading pair into the far turn, led at the five sixteenths pole, but drifted outwardly multiple paths in upper stretch,
then lugged in severely at the furlong grounds while clinging to an advantage, then was bested a sixteenth to go. I DONT KNOW EITHER popped the gate
open pre-race without leaving it, then bobbled a bit before being forced into an inner rival by an outer foe at the start, raced far off fo the pace along the
inside, split rivals two wide at the three sixteenths pole to claim show, and was gaining on the top two through the final furlong. VERRAZANO ISLAND was
sandwiched hard between horses a the start, rated far off of the pace in the three path, gained in the five path and outside of foes around the far turn, but
leveled off in midstretch. SAFE KEEPING vied for the lead two wide and between horses early on, cleared an inner foe into the backstretch, but faded into
the far turn. LANGFUHR'S ANGEL laid close up along the inside early on, backed off to stalk approaching the backstretch, shifted three wide at the five
furlong pole, bid outside of the leader into the far turn, vied among foes around that bend, but failed to keep pace turning for home, and weakened in upper
stretch. ST MARIA broke outwardly and bothered multiple foes at the start, tracked the pace in the three path, chased under strong urging in the four path
around the far turn, but faded. CREOLE BABY got pinched back between horses at the start, then was done early and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
LOUISIANA MOON stalked along the inside, lost position passing the five furlong pole to be off of the pace, then tipped two wide entering the lane, rallied to
claim place from outer foes at the furlong pole, took aim outside of the clear leader entering the final sixteenth, and got up on the wire. IM A COWBOY TOO
pressed two wide, led at the half mile pole, showed the way from outer foes around the far turn, drew clear in upper stretch, but was worn down in the final
sixteenth. MR. FOUR SEVENS tracked three wide, inched closer to press two wide from the three path into the far turn, but failed to keep pace in upper
stretch, and held show. HENNING laid off of the pace two wide, tracked outside of the leading pair from the four path around the far turn, but lacked a kick
and held fourth. LIKE MIKE raced at the rear in the six to four path around the first turn, tracked from off of the pace in the three path around the far turn, but
failed to make an impact. VISION OF ANGELS bobbled inwardly at the start, tucked from the five path to the rail at the rear of the field around the first turn,
then moved up inside of foes in the lane. GUILTY LOVER raced off of the pace along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, but drifted outwardly
when asked to shift outside of foes in upper stretch, and failed to factor. CABO'S RUMOR laid off of the pace four wide, tracked in the five path around the
far turn, but faded in upper stretch. WAR TRIBUTE popped open the gate pre-race, then was escorted out before being re-loaded, set the pace along the
inside around the first turn, got headed at the half mile pole, stalked from the pocket into the far turn, but weakened thereafter.

COACH KENNY tracked in the three to four path around the turn before tipping to the five path entering the lane, then rallied to bid at the furlong grounds,
and drew clear in the final sixteenth. CYPRIANO stalked the clear leader from the four path around the turn, bid entering the lane, led in upper stretch, but
met COACH KENNY's outer bid at the furlong grounds, and was bested approaching the final sixteenth. GYPSY'S SOULMATE stalked along the inside,
chased outer bidding foes through upper stretch, and faded. CIROC O CLOCK leapt at the start and spotted multiple the field multiple lengths, lagged well
behind, and was outrun before passing a tiring foe. TRIPPER JOHN set a clear pace in the three path around the turn, but weakened between horses
entering the lane without being asked for his best run.

Footnotes
GO BIG GREEN popped the gate open without leaving when GIRL'S ON FIRE broke through it, then stumbled badly at the start, lagged behind the field into
the far turn, saved ground before pausing behind a wall of foes passing the quarter pole, but railed well along the rail through midstretch to bid at the
sixteenth pole, and drove clear. FOREVER DREAMING got restless in the gate causing outer foes to break through, vied inside of GIRL'S ON FIRE early
on, backed off to stalk entering the backstretch, shifted outside of that rival at the five furlong pole, quickly surpassed that tiring foe approaching the lane to
lead in the three path at the quarter pole, inched clear in upper stretch, tired in the final furlong as foes on both sides closed in,, was bested by an inner rival
at the sixteenth pole, and held place. I'M FINE tracked from the three path, gained three wide turning for home, chased a clear FOREVER DREAMING from
the four path through upper stretch, ranged closer approaching the final furlong, but was outkicked by an inner foe shortly after, then hung and was unable
to reach place. QUINN MURPHY settled far back in the three path, tracked two wide and between horses around the far turn, then tipped outside of the
leaders to the five path in upper stretch, but only managed to chase evenly. SCARLETT LACE took a bump from an inner foe at the start, saved ground off
of the pace, improved inside of rivals down the backstretch, then shifted three wide entering the lane, but only managed to chase before fading. GIRL'S ON
FIRE broke through the gate pre-race, then broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, vied two wide before clearing off into the backstretch, opened up
shortly after, but tired into the far turn, and was overhauled entering the lane before weakening. DRAWN TO RACE (GER) stalked in the two to three path
around the first turn, but was outmoved by inner foes while four wide at the half mile pole, came under urging shortly after, then weakened turning for home,
and was eased through the final furlong.

PRIME FACTOR set the pace, showed the way inside of a pressing foe while in hand in the two path, then was let out passing the quarter pole, responded
to brief and light urging to draw off in upper stretch, and won handily. PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE chased the pace three wide while in the four path and
under steady urging, bid for place in upper stretch, and gained that position at the sixteenth pole without threatening the leader. ON YOUR MARK pressed
the pace setter from the three path around the turn, but failed to keep pace at the quarter pole, and lost place a sixteenth from home. KOOLHAUS tracked
the pace two wide and from between horses, but lacked a rally. SCHMOOZIN was slow into stride, lagged behind the field into the turn, and never got
involve. MIDNIGHT SHIFT stalked along the inside, but weakened through the lane. NO HEAD-ON REPLAY AVAILABLE

Footnotes
SIN CITY GAL vied for the lead two wide and between horses, backed off to stalk at the half mile pole, saved ground behind the leaders around the turn,
then produced a rail bid in upper stretch, cleared at the furlong grounds, and held sway safely. OMKARA vied for the lead three wide, then two wide from the
three path around the turn, led in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner bidder approaching the furlong grounds, and kept on to secure place. ONE
MORE LAUGH stalked two wide and between horses, tipped to the four path entering the lane, and chased evenly thereafter. MY FRIEND AMY laid off of
the pace in the four path, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, changed leads at the furlong grounds, then quickened and rallied belatedly. SAY I WON'T
raced in midpack in the two to three path, and stayed on through the lane, but was outkicked for a minor share late. VINEGAR VEGGIES stalked outside of
the top pair while in the four path around the turn, came into the lane in the five path, but subtly drifted outwardly on his right lead in upper stretch, flopped
back to his left lead under right handed urging at the furlong grounds, and tired. TRIPLE P vied for the lead inside of a rival while a path off of the rail, then
yielded between horses at the three--sixteenths pole before weakening. FORDLAND raced at the rear along the inside, vacated the rail in upper stretch,
then continued to shift outside of foes through the final furlong without threatening. I AM UP broke slowly, trailed two wide into the turn, and never got
involved. SUMMER TSUNAMI took the turn in the three path while far off of the pace, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
SPEIGHT'SPERCOMETE stalked three wide, ranged up to bid approaching the furlong pole, and drove clear. ZAP MOTION dueled for the lead two wide,
led in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the furlong grounds, and proved second best. SUPERCOOL tracked along the inside, chased
behind the leaders through upper stretch, shifted to the four path at the furlong grounds, and reached show late. ARDANWOOD dueled for the lead along
the inside, but yielded approaching the furlong grounds, and lost show late. RATIFICATION broke a step slowly, tracked four wide, but failed to bid.
SHANGHAI TRICK balked at the starting gate before loading, then broke in a tangle, raced off of the pace in the two to three path around the turn, and
chased along the rail. AMERICAN SMOOTH raced at the rear in the three to four path around the turn, and got outrun.

Footnotes
SPELLBINDING set the pace, drew clear down the backstretch, widened his advantage in upper stretch, then tired in the final furlong as G'S DEADLINE
closed in, and just lasted to the wire. G'S DEADLINE broke outwardly, tracked from off of the pace in the four to three path around the first turn, then in the
three to four path around the far turn before floating to the six path in upper stretch, rallied well to claim place at the furlong grounds and take aim on the
clear leader, then cut into his margin to produce a bid on the wire, but missed. TOP TEN DUCHESS prompted the pace two wide, stalked down the
backstretch, drifted to the four path in upper stretch, then got outkicked for place while chasing between horses at the furlong grounds, but saved show late.
MILA'S GOLD settled far off of the pace in the four path, tipped to the five path around the far turn, then to the seven path in upper stretch, rallied while
chasing G'S DEADLINE's advance, but leveled off in the final furlong, and hung for show. LIL ASHLEY B. broke slowly and trailed the field in the five path
around the first turn, then in the three path around the far turn, fanned to the six path in upper stretch, and stayed on late. AIR GUITAR STAR rated off of
the pace two wide, altered three wide in midstretch, and passed tired foes. SAVVY SHIPMAN saved ground while tracking from midpack, bid for place in
midstretch, but flattened out shortly after. CRIMSON FELINE tracked the pace three to two wide around the first turn, but tired in the final furlong. DUEPEG
raced far off of the pace along the inside, and never got involved. BALOOK stalked along the inside, shifted three wide at the five furlong pole, got floated to
the five path by an inner drifting rival in upper stretch, and weakened passing the three sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
ZOZOS tracked four wide, ranged up with inner foes in upper stretch, grinded away in pursuit of STAYED IN FOR HALF in the final furlong, reached that
rival in the final sixteenth, and won under wraps. STAYED IN FOR HALF stalked two wide, bid in upper stretch as outer rivals closed in as well, led at the
furlong grounds, inched clear shortly after, but lugged inwardly in the final sixteenth, and got bested late. STRONG QUALITY raced off of the pace four to
five wide, then stayed on while hanging on his left lead. MARITAL BLISS tracked the pace three wide and between horses, ranged up in upper stretch,
chased among rivals through the final furlong, but lost show late. MAJOR CONTENDER took a bump from an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the
two path, and failed to threaten while staying on mildly. BRION broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, sped clear into the turn, but weakened inside
of a trio of foes at the furlong grounds. FEROCITY failed to factor. BRIGADIER GENERAL showed little in a dull effort.
