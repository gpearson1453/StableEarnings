Footnotes
GOOD TIME DOLLY tracked the pace to the second turn, was asked for run nearing the quarter-marker and steadily gained on the pacesetter, wore down
CIRCULODEGANADORAS into the lane and drew clear in the end. CIRCULODEGANADORAS took command of the early pace into the first turn, was
prompted by GOOD TIME DOLLY into the second turn, could not hold off the bid of that foe in upper stretch but kept on to best the rest. TOTALLY
NORMAL saved ground while stalking the pace to the second turn and was outfinished in the drive but held for third in the final strides. BRITE TAN stalked
the pace outside of foes to the second turn and lacked a late rally. NORTHERN ROSE settled off of the pace, steadied off of heels into the second turn and
weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
EROTIC sat just off of the pace into the turn, gained ground from a three wide path into the stretch, was firmly handled in the final furlong and determinedly
closed to get the win. POSO CREEK was pinched at the start, tracked the pace while saving ground through the turn, made an inside bid into the stretch to
take command, led into the final sixteenth and was nailed by the winner on the line while clear of the rest. TWIRLING DERBY chased the pace outside of
foes to the turn, was still trailing heading into the stretch and closed well in the late stages to earn the nod for third. JEDI KNIGHT contested the pace from a
three wide path through the turn, vied for the lead leaving the turn but was outkicked in the drive and just missed for third. HULA KING broke out at the start
and bumped POSO CREEK, was sent to set disputed fractions through the turn, came under pressure nearing the top of the lane and was outfinished in the
late stages. ZERO BUCKS GIVEN was fractious prior to the start, chased the pace to the turn, lost ground while four wide on the turn and weakened in the
stretch.

Footnotes
FAR WEST was away alertly and set the pace, was pressured into the second turn, shook free of the pressing rival in to the stretch, was pressured again in
the final stages, was firmly urged and safely held in the end. LINFIELD settled off of the pace while saving ground, was two wide on the second turn, swung
widest into stretch, mounted a bold late rally in the final furlong and was gaining on the winner in the end but could not reel him in while getting up in time to
claim second. SUNNY SPOT settled in the second flight while three wide, lacked room along the second turn, continued to be boxed in heading into the
lane, closed well late to secure third and just missed for second. OH BE ONE saved ground while settling off of the pace in the second flight, gained ground
into the stretch run and finished willingly in the late stages. MEGAMEISTER saved ground while close up to the second turn and did not mount a final bid in
the stretch. ANTARCTIC was four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace outside of rivals to the second turn, gained ground nearing the quarter-marker
while four wide and was outkicked in the drive. MAXINAMILLION was allowed to settle through the backstretch run, was steered five wide along the second
turn and offered a mild late gain in the stretch while on the left lead. AGENT ZERO attended to the pace from a three wide path to the second turn, checked
nearing the quarter-marker while in tight quarters, lost ground into the stretch run and was empty in the late stages.

Footnotes
THE PHARAOH'S GIRL was away alertly and was sent to set the fractions, was pressed through the turn, shook clear of the pressing rival leaving the turn
and pulled away in the end. DOGGY DREAMS was rank in the run into the turn while outside of rivals, was four wide along the turn and closed well in the
stretch, and while no match for the winner was best of the rest. AFTERDINNERDRINK lagged a bit in the early going while trailing into the turn, was two
wide along the turn, swung widest into the drive and offered a mild late rally to claim third. OH TRUTHY was a bit rank in the run to the turn, was three wide
along the turn, improved position into the stretch and was outkicked in the drive, just missing for third. CITY GLITTER chased the pace while two wide to the
turn, gained a bit of ground leaving the turn and weakened in the stretch. GOVERNOR SPECIAL pressed the fractions from a two wide path to the turn, lost
ground into the stretch and faded in the late going. NIGHTBIRD was away a bit slowly and lugged in to the rail leaving the break, saved ground through the
turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
TROJAN CLUBHOUSE was away alertly and set the pace while being pressed by the runner-up, rated nicely through the second turn, kept MAGICAL
THOUGHT at bay into the lane and felt pressure from that rival in the end but dug in late to prevail. MAGICAL THOUGHT engaged TROJAN CLUBHOUSE
along the first turn and pressed the pace to the second turn, kept pressure on the winner into the stretch run and battled gamely in the end but could not get
by in the final stages. BLUE BREEZE was allowed to settle while saving ground to the second turn and closed well in the stretch to be a clear third.
ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) stalked the pace from a three wide path, gained ground along the second turn, lost ground into the stretch and gave way in the
late going. LAST INNING hit the gate at the start, jostled the rider and lost irons into the first turn, recovered into the backstretch run, was forwardly placed
to the second turn, lost ground into the stretch and tired in the final stages. MANGOTANGO saved ground through the early stages while stalking the pace
from the second flight, was steered four wide on the second turn and weakened in the drive. LADY DOC was unhurried in the early going, trailed to the
second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FANTASTIC SECRET tracked the pace to the second turn, mounted a two wide bid to overtake RED DAHLIA nearing the quarter-marker, took a clear lead
into the stretch run, was kept to task through the lane and had the margin cut into by the runner-up in the end but held safely in the final strides. RED
DAHLIA was away in good order and cleared the field into the first turn to set the pace, came under pressure from FANTASTIC SECRET along the second
turn, ceded the lead to that foe, chased into the stretch, was able to gain a bit of ground in the late going but could not reel in the winner and bested the rest.
MISS YOU MOM was allowed to settle through the first half-mile, was two wide on the second turn, mounted an inside rally in the drive and was up in time
to secure third. AMERICAN ROYALTY was four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace to the second turn from a three wide path and finished evenly in the
stretch run. LACEY'S RAINBOW tracked the pace from the inside, angled out into the stretch run and weakened in the final furlong. FIRE DIAMONDS
saved ground while settling off of the early pace and faded in the late stages.

FREEPORT JOE was three wide along the first turn, stalked the pace through the backstretch run, was roused along the second turn, was urged through
the stretch run, took command inside of the sixteenth-marker while on the left lead and held to prevail. AMERICAN FARMER tracked the early pace from a
two wide path, was three wide on the second turn, was in tight leaving the second turn and into upper stretch, angled out in the final sixteenth and closed
well in traffic to claim the place. IN OUR A was away alertly and set the pace while being prompted to the second turn, led into the stretch run, was caught
by the winner nearing the sixteenth-marker and was outfinished in the end, while holding for third. HARMON was allowed to settle off of the early pace while
outside of rivals, was four wide on the second turn, gained ground into the stretch and was outkicked in the late going. NAVY ARMED GUARD saved
ground while stalking the pace to the second turn, gained a bit of ground leaving the second turn and was outfinished in the drive. DESCARTES engaged IN

Footnotes
SQUARED SHADY chased the pace to the turn, improved position while two wide on the bend, continued that run to confront SEVEN SISTERS off of the
turn, dueled with that rival through the lane and dug in in the final strides to prevail in a head nod. SEVEN SISTERS was away alertly and was sent to set
fast fractions while being pressured, met the bid of SQUARED SHADY off of the turn, dueled for the final furlong with that foe and was gamely bested in the
end, while clear of the rest. MAYCEE JO chased the pace outside of rivals to the turn, was four wide on the bend, lost ground into the stretch and was
outfinished in the drive, while holding for third. SWANEE chased the early pace to the turn, improved position to press the pace along the bend while saving
ground, was in tight approaching the quarter-marker and weakened in the stretch. AWESOME AMANDA chased the pace from a two wide path and did not
offer a final bid in the stretch. MORNING ADDICTION pressed the early pace then took back to stalk the pace on the turn while three wide, lost ground into
the stretch and gave way in the late going. DEE GEE was away slowly and spotted the field several lengths, was outrun to the turn, lost ground into the
stretch, was not asked for run in the late going and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
RHODIUM RUNNER was away alertly and was sent to set a fast pace through the turn, extended the lead into the stretch and held safely in the end over
the oncoming runner-up. WALKING BOSS stalked the pace from the midflight from a three wide path, gained ground into the stretch and continued that run
to close well in the final sixteenth, was unable to reel in the winner but bested the rest. NIGHT PROOF sat just off of the early pace while outside of rivals,
mounted a five wide rally leaving the turn and while not able to impact the top pair was up in time to secure third. MEETMEATTHECLUB was away slowly,
chased the pace to the turn, was steered to the rail along the bend and was gaining in the stretch but was unable to reel in the top three. YOU'RE THE
CAUSE stalked the pace from a two wide position, lost ground into the stretch and did not have a final bid to offer. GOFASTANDWIN stalked the quick pace
to the turn while three wide, gained a bit of ground on the pacesetter nearing the quarter-marker and lacked a late response in the stretch. RIVIERA CHAMP
tracked the pace outside of rivals into the turn, gained ground while four wide on the bend, was still within aim leaving the turn but gave way in the stretch.
CREATIVE ONE broke in a tangle and was away slowly, chased to the turn, steadied off of heels into the turn, saved ground into the stretch run and made a
mild late gain in the drive. IKE BUTTE chased the pace outside of foes to the turn, was steered to the two path along the turn while trailing and faded in the
late going.
