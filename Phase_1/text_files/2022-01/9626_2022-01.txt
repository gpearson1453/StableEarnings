GO NUTS stalked the early pace while racing near the inside down the backstretch, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths pole, dug in late and
prevailed under strong handling. MEMPHIS PRAYER chased the top pair down the backstretch, moved up five wide into the upper lane and finished gamely
to the wire. G FOR GERRY was allowed to settle off the early pace, moved up near the inside around the far turn through the lane and had not enough for
the top pair. SONIC BURN was slow in the early stages, raced six wide into the upper stretch and made a mild late bid to improve his position. AMES
MISTER showed good early speed to set the early pace, was angled off the rail through the upper lane and weakened the final eighth of a mile. ROUSING
SIREN settled off the early pace, raced in the two path through the drive and had no late response. DO YOUR BEST raced five wide around the first turn,
settled off the early going while racing five deep down the backstretch, raced four wide near the quarter pole and had no late rally. C F V WICKED RED
raced four wide around the first turn and never was a factor. RACE WAS HAND-TIMED AND FRACTIONS PROVIDED UPON REVIEW.

late under strong handling. SUPER READY tracked the early leader down the backstretch, moved up three through the upper stretch to take command but
couldn't match strides with the winner late to finish second best. SOLAR KITTEN was slow in the early going, raced five wide into the upper stretch and
flattened out in the drive. KITTEN ROCKS stalked the early going, experienced traffic just past the quarter pole, moved up four to three wide in the drive and
had no final winning bid. WOKE UP TO ACES showed good early speed to set the early pace and gave way in the stretch run. QUEEN LOUISE was
allowed to settle to the middle of the pack early on, raced three to two wide through the lane and had no response. MAYAPRETTY dropped back early,
raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no late rally. GENERAL GINNY stalked the early pace, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and
weakened. FIONA POWER settled off the early pace, raced four wide in the drive and had no response. TOP HAT INVASION dropped back early and failed
to respond. PRINCESS CELESTE was slow early, raced five in the lane and never was a factor. TRENDY NEVE raced five wide around the 1st turn and

Footnotes
RUN RUN RAPIDASH was quick to begin to set the early pace and drew away to be well clear late under steady handling. LOFTY ADJUDICATOR was
allowed to settle off the early going, moved up five to six wide through the upper stretch and was no match for the winner. COUNTERSTRIKE chased the
early leader, raced two to three wide in the stretch run and weakened the final eighth of a mile. BRONZE HALO stalked the top pair early on, raced three
wide and had no late response. INSPIRATION POINT broke to the outside, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, angled five wide and had no late rally.
BIG PAPER settled off the early going, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and never was a factor. BABYLON was off very slow,
moved up five wide near the quarter pole and never threatened. HOW IT GOES failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
PALLAS ATHENE was allowed to settle to the middle of the pack early on, moved up four to five wide through the stretch and drew off late under strong
encouragement. LEMON POPPER showed good early speed to set the pace, raced near the inside and couldn't match strides with the winner late to finish
second best. ELKE DO JAGUARETE (BRZ) was slow in the early stages, moved up six wide through the stretch run and showed late interest.
TILTINGATWINDMILLS was forwardly placed to lay up close, raced three deep and weakened a bit in the final stages. ASIAAF (GB) settled off the early
going, raced five wide through the lane and had no late rally. HOT HEELS was unhurried early, raced just off the inside and had no late response. DANCE
RECITAL dropped back early, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole, angled in and had not enough in the drive. POLKA POLENTA was bumped at
the break, settled off the early pace, raced seven wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. KIMBERLEY DREAM stalked the early going and
weakened while racing three wide. WONDER BLONDY stalked the early pace and tired while racing along the inside in the drive. BELLE BELISA (IRE)
broke to the inside, bumped with rival, made a middle move near the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
BUGLE BARRY stalked the pace, lacked room near the three sixteenths pole, split rivals to move through the while racing two to three wide and finished
well to prove best under strong pressure. WILE E PEYOTE showed good early speed to set all the pace, couldn't match strides with Bugle Barry late, dug in
late and held the place position. JOLTING JOE raced five wide around the first turn, stalked the pace from the outside, raced four to five wide in the lane
and finished willingly to the wire. DIRECT APPROACH was slow early on, raced seven wide into the upper stretch and made a good late bid. MARKITOFF
pressed the early leader down the backstretch, was hard ridden near the three eighths pole and weakened the final eighth of a mile. INCLUSIVE stalked the
pace from the inside down the backstretch and had no late rally. COUNTER OFFER was allowed to settle to the middle of the pack, raced five wide near the
three sixteenths pole and had no late response. TALLESTOFTHETALL was unhurried early, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch
and never was a factor. TOMAHAWK KITTEN dropped back early, raced six wide through the lane and failed to respond.
