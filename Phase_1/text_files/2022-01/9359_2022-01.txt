Footnotes
GLENDORA MINECAT was forwardly-positioned between runners two deep into the turn, took the lead leaving that bend, moved clear in upper stretch and
extended the margin while being kept to the task. U S N CADEN shifted out early heading up the backstretch while lacking sufficient early speed, went three
then four wide on the turn, came out further at the top of the stretch, exchanged contact with SMOKEN HOUDINI past the three-sixteenths then again at the
furlong marker, kept on from between runners to captured the place while no threat to the winner. HUNKY DUNN chased from outside, went four wide on
the turn, was outfinished for second. SMOKEN HOUDINI settled in behind the leaders, entered the turn two wide angling out five deep by the end of that
bend, exchanged light bumps in upper stretch and at the eighth pole and evened out late. ELUSIVE ACCOUNTING prompted the pace from outside initially,
went three wide on the turn, came up empty for the drive. JAZZIE DREAM was urged forward at the break chasing inside, checked and lost the irons just
past the seven-sixteenths pole and was not a threat thereafter. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION FINAL TIME WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
CHARLIE COMANCH was off the leaders racing outside, went five wide on the turn being asked for run by the quarter pole, moved wider in upper stretch,
kicked clear past the furlong marker and cleared under steady handling. FLYING FALCON settled off the pace along the inside, angled six wide in upper
stretch, ran on for the place. DIABOLICAL RULER pressed from outside then between runners four wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. DESERT
DANGER contended three wide and between foes, weakened. FRANKS DEHERE was off slowly, moved outside a rival up the backstretch, went two wide
initially on the turn, angled seven deep coming out of that bend and failed to rally. HESA PROSPECTOR set a pressured pace racing off the rail, faltered
and faded.
