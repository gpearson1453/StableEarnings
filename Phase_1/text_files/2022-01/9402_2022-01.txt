Footnotes
MORNING LIGHT was in hand early, rallied on the far turn three wide with a quick burst, drew off in the stretch under steady handling to win as much the
best. NATALIA'S TEMPLE had good position early, rallied at the quarter pole and gained the lead, was no match late for the winner but was second best.
NAITAKA pressed early on the inside, dropped back on the far turn, swung in the stretch and had a mild bid. VISITING ANGEL was well placed throughout,
lacked a late response and went evenly late. RUNNING ROSADO set the pace for five eights, then gave way. SAN NICOLA PRANCER pressed three wide
for a half, then faded.
