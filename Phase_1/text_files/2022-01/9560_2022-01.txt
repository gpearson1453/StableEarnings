Footnotes
QPIDSCARIZMATKQTEE , outside ALL WORKED UP chasing that one around the turn and in upper stretch, drifted out when taking the lead near the
sixteenth pole then drove clear. ALL WORKED UP hopped slightly at the break, accelerated to the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail and weakened
near the sixteenth pole. MAGIC IN ME hugged the inner rail around the turn, angled to the three path in upper stretch and had a mild rally. REGINA lacked
speed, came into the stretch in the two path and had a late rally inside horses. GLOWSITY , three deep leaving the backstretch, moved to the two path on
the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and came up empty. SHE SO COOL lacked speed, raced along the inner rail around the turn and failed to
be a factor. VIVI MY LOVE , three wide chasing the pace to the stretch, faltered.

Footnotes
GUNHAND , away alertly, dueled to the inside of KRUG while under some rating, shook clear leaving the far turn and was guided a bit further off the rail,
kept on under left handed rousing past mid stretch, drifted late but held firm. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY eased off the rail around the first turn and stalked the
dueling leaders three wide, was under pressure pursuing from the five sixteenths and kept on willingly to be well clear of the rest. AXXERATOR , taken back
soon after the break, then steadied when a bit rough to settle past the seven eighths, stayed inside while well back past the three quarter pole, took up the
chase into the far turn, made a menacing move towards the rail to have aim past the five sixteenths but failed to sustain in the drive. PRINCE OF
PORTLAND settled of the rail, angled out near the three eighths, ranged up four wide outside foes nearing the lane, failed to kick on past the three
sixteenths and weakened. CAIRO BOOGIE lagged off the pace and failed to menace. KRUG was hard sent to contention, went head to head outside the
winner through the opening half mile, failed to kick on leaving the three eighths and faltered.

Footnotes
KYMMIES CHARDONNAY stumbled leaving the starting gate, prompted the pace outside ORBIT MARS, overtook that one approaching the eighth pole and
narrowly prevailed. ORBIT MARS sped to the early lead, set a pressured pace along the inner, lost the lead in upper stretch and dug in tenaciously to just
miss. MONARCH BEACH bumped after stumbling at the break, was in the two path on the turn, rallied inside horses and was forced to alter course
approaching the finish. DIAL ME MAYBE , reluctant to load into the starting gate, was forwardly placed three wide around the turn and lacked the necessary
rally. BANTAM ROOSTER , a forward factor along the inner rail on the turn, steadily retreated. IRISH CHAOS , no factor, was two wide leaving the turn. LA
REINA SUSAN , jostled leaving the starting gate, was four wide leaving the turn. EMMA DEVINE , steadied in tight quarters leaving the backstretch, raced
four wide turning for home. HELLO JAMROCK , caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail on the turn, eased out leaving
the turn and weakened. IMAGINE THE MOJO was outrun.

Footnotes
JOE edged up along the rail while in hand past the three quarter pole and stalked, eased off the rail and was put to coaxing with three furlongs remaining,
crept closer then worked through between runners into the lane, forged clear under strong handling heading to the eighth pole, remained on his left lead but
held firm while kept to task. SHADY MUNNI broke a step slow, recovered and moved up wide to contention, tracked four wide outside rivals early on,
dropped in a bit and bid to press leaving the far turn, pursued a clear leader while four wide past the five sixteenths and continued on gamely to the line.
MR. MOX rated off the leader around the first turn then eased out to prompt, bid to gain command between runners leaving the far turn, spurted clear, failed
to contain the winner past the three sixteenths and faded. NATAGAR rated along between runners while close up past the three quarter pole, eased out
near the half mile marker, shifted out and was put to pressure soon after, chased four wide past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on entering the lane and
faded. LORD MIO , a bit rank early on, dropped off the pace and failed to respond. RUN ON THE TRAIL cleared early, set the pace towards the inside,
ceded command around the far turn, pursued to the quarter pole, faltered soon into the lane then was pulled up and walked off.

Footnotes
AUCTION KINGDOM drifted out leaving the starting gate, moved up three deep leaving the turn, closed outside RED MESA, challenged for the lead near
the sixteenth pole and narrowly prevailed. RED MESA , reluctant to load into the starting gate, gained a two wide lead approaching the three eighths pole,
raced along the inner rail in the stretch and dug in tenaciously in the drive. BISCOTTO D'ORO , pinched back leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail
entering the turn, eased out to the two path approaching the stretch and rallied gamely. NO MONEY DOWN raced in the two path entering the turn, was
steadied when shuffled back inside the three eighths pole, angled out near the quarter pole and finished willingly. BUSHWICK BRUISER , five deep on the
turn, was outrun. GATORATER raced in the two path between horses on the turn and was not a factor. MADE TO BE LUCKY , in the four path between
horses on the turn, weakened. MY SON CHRIS was outrun. POWER G , well off the rail chasing the pace, faltered leaving the turn. GRASPIN' AT STRAWS
sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail on the turn, faltered, fell galloping out and walked off. An objection by the rider of NO MONEY DOWN against
the winner for alleged interference near the five sixteenths pole was not allowed.

Footnotes
HALITE settled off the rail, advanced between rivals nearing the five sixteenths, brushed with a foe when angling seven wide for the stretch, ranged up
under asking to join SILENT MALICE in mid stretch, dueled, gained a slim lead a sixteenth out then held firm under steady handling. SILENT MALICE rated
off the pace while saving ground, moved up mid turn, slipped through along the rail to take command past the three sixteenths, dueled through the final
furlong and kept on gamely. ROUGH SEA pulled his way forward towards the inside early on, stalked inside foes, eased out and bid nearing mid stretch but
failed to seriously kick on. KID D'ORO prompted four wide early, checked when three deep leaving the far turn, dropped back a bit then swung eight wide
into the stretch, straightened and came back on with interest. MY MAN POTS N PANS settled off the pace, angled nine wide into the stretch and closed
steadily. GOODLUCKCHUCK , in close at the break, recovered and attended the pace three deep, dueled into and around the turn, seized command and
went clear soon into the stretch, could not fend off challenges past the three sixteenths and weakened. EVEN THUNDER bid between foes leaving the three
quarter pole, dueled between runners into and around the turn, fought on to the quarter pole then weakened. HOT N SPICY LOVE settled back off the pace
while saving ground, shifted out under pressure for the drive but lacked a bid. V. I. P. CODE , brushed at the break, was sent up between runners and took
over leaving the chute, dropped in a bit then met bids leaving the three quarter pole, dueled inside runners while two wide past the three eighths, failed to
kick on entering the lane and faltered. NO MORE TALK stalked between foes, was under pressure past mid turn and tired.

THE ADDISON POUR , three deep entering the turn, moved over to the inner rail approaching the stretch, eased off the rail in mid stretch, closed
determinedly between horses and took the lead approaching the finish. MONEY ROOM hugged the inner rail on the turn, was taken to the three path turning
for home and rallied outside foes. MUST BE LOVE hopped at the break, prompted the pace to the stretch, gained a two wide lead in upper stretch and
finished gamely but was not good enough. VIOLENT ROCK circled the turn three wide, was fanned four wide turning for home and flattened out. SAGRADA
RAY sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail was prompted and weakened the final three sixteenths of a mile. KIAWAH ISLAND trailed.

SHEMADEMELUCKY broke outward and bumped with NO MORE MASK, corrected and rated off the pace, moved up to the inside of a rival leaving the far
turn, ease out then waited patiently past the three eighths, found a seam when three wide in upper stretch, responded when roused and quickly moved to
command past the three sixteenths, eagerly widened and won under mild handling. CHICA RABIOSA accelerated to a clear early lead, set a rated pace two
wide, was set down soon into the lane, could not contain the winner but kept on willingly to be clearly second best. MIZ THE BEST , off last after an
awkward beginning, rushed up inside, took closer order leaving the half mile pole, chased into the lane then went even through the final furlong. HIT A
HOMER HONEY settled early off the rail, ranged up four wide past mid turn, loomed and gave way. NO MORE MASK , bumped at the break, stalked three
wide, was in range under a ride past the three eighths then gave way. TINAS SHINING STAR , off the pace, angled four wide into lane and failed to
respond. SKYLAR'S LADY gave early chase and dropped back. HOLIDAY CONNECTION , three wide, faltered.

GOING TO THE LEAD showed speed down the backstretch, hugged the inner rail disputing the early pace with RAD PAISLEY, disposed of that one after a
half mile, was engaged by HUNTER JOE entering the stretch, battled with that one and determinedly prevailed. HUNTER JOE rushed up three deep on the
turn, challenged for the lead approaching the stretch, dueled through the lane and just missed in a sharp effort. RISING PERRY stalked the pace racing
near the inner rail on the turn, swung four wide entering the stretch and lacked the needed rally. HAIR OF THE DOG , slightly off the rail on the turn, was
outrun. STONE COURAGEOUS , far back most of the race, lacked a rally. RAD PAISLEY stumbled leaving the starting gate, disputed the pace outside
GOING TO THE LEAD for a half mile then gave way.

Footnotes
IAN DUNROSS settled off the rail, moved up three wide as the pace battle went on heading to the lane, altered out for a clear run leaving mid stretch,
surged past the leader inside the sixteenth pole and drew clear under a drive. TRANSFER THE FUNDS , well placed off the dueling leaders leaving the
three eighths, rallied five wide to engage the leaders approaching the lane, kicked clear under a drive in mid stretch, kept on willingly but failed to contain the
winner. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE prompted the pace two wide, bid to engage the leader nearing the far turn, dueled on a short lead past the five sixteenths,
kept up the battle in upper stretch then faded late. SPRITZER , bumped at the start, cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, dueled from the far turn
to about the quarter pole then gave way. ONE MOST WANTED broke a step slow, lost ground four wide around the first turn, edged up a bit while three
wide past the five eighths but failed to kick on through the final three furlongs. EL BONITA broke inward and bumped with a rival then was outrun.
CREATIVE STORM dropped far back.
