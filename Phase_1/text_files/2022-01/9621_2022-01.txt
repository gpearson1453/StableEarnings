Footnotes
ULTIMATE broke with the leaders, took back soon after, moved out and was four wide when beginning to advance turning for home, long drive to the wire,
late bid, just up. COLD AS HELL away in good order, vied early between rivals, quick duel into and through the turn, shook off the other speed when
straightened for home, clear past the furlong marker, responded late and proved stubborn in the waning strides. FLAT LUCKY last away, trailed for a half off
the inside, steered out to be four wide late in the turn, widest in the drive, late rally to miss. SUBSTANTIAL back off the pace in the two path, in some traffic
upper stretch, steered inward a bit but could only mange to finish up evenly when clear. WILD BEHAVIOR pressed the issue up the backstretch and through
the turn while racing three wide, weakened in the drive. BULL HOLLOW broke on top, raced behind the leaders off the inside, three wide into the lane, had
little left for the stretch run. STURGILL moved up the inside, dueled through those quick fractions while along the rail, gave way in the drive. LONG TERM
THINKING saved ground well off the pace, failed to fire in lacking a closing response.

Footnotes
TOWN CHAMP dueled up front while off the inside, disposed of the other speed when approaching the furlong grounds, clear then held the next two safe
late under brisk handling. DON'T FORGET off the pace and the inside, two path ;into the lane, steered inside the winner with less than a furlong remaining,
late bid, missed. TAPPIN FORA DANCE in the second flight while racing three wide, slowly getting to the winner late outside that one, outkicked for the
place. VERRAZANO FIRST in the second group outside, came three wide into the lane, remained back off the top three through the lane in lacking a late
punch. STORM ADVISORY settled off the pace, saved some ground into the turn, moved off the inside midway on the turn, went evenly through the lane.
SKYSCANNER mid pack just off the inside, saved ground into the lane, lacked closing kick. ALEX'S STRIKE void of speed, passed tiring rivals to improve
position, no real threat. ARCHIEMYBOY raced back off the pace outside, four wide through the turn, failed to rally. THE QUEENS JULES was never a
factor. LONELY PRIVATE dueled up front inside the winner for a half, gave way the final furlong to lose quite a few positions. RIVERBOAT GAMBLER
remained always back. CALIFORNIA SWING off a step slow, remained always back.

Footnotes
WOBBERJOD pressed the issue up the backstretch in the two path, took over late in the turn, hooked up with SEAU for an extended and heated stretch
duel, fully extended to narrowly prevail while on the rail at the wire. SEAU forwardly placed off the inside, ranged up to challenge the winner turning for
home, long duel, narrowly missed at the wire. GOLD ENDEAVOR stumbled badly at the start, raced back and in the two path through the turn, improved
position with a mild rally down the lane, no threat to the top pair. FIRERY TALE off a step slow, raced back just off the inside, also improved position through
the lane while inside of several rivals. REPLETE in the second flight toward the inside, in traffic, brief wait three furlongs out, steered out three wide, went
evenly when clear for the drive. PRESS SNOOZE made little impact with a one paced effort three out to four wide in the turn. PETIT VERDOT in mid pack
outside, four wide turning for home, failed to muster a rally. PAST POST showed the way up the backstretch inside, briefly responded when challenged by
the winner midway on the turn then began to falter. HORSE GREEDY broke in the air and in a tangle to spot the field several lengths, remained well back
when trailing throughout. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
SECRET OATH unhurried early while three wide, continued in hand in the run up the backstretch, moved at will three wide to the fore late in the final turn,
soon clear, drifted in nearing the furlong marker, continued to expand that advantage to the wire under only token encouragement to win ridden out.
OPTIONALITY broke alertly, set a soft pace while in hand, rated kindly into the far turn, offered little in the way of resistance to the winner when straightened
for home, remained well clear for the place. COMO SQUARE settled behind the leader along the inside, continued to save ground when creeping closer in
the second turn, in some traffic late in that bend, had little for the top two when clear for the drive, best of rest. HYPERSPORT broke back, went one paced
throughout while racing toward the inside. PRINCESS PAULINE hopped a bit at the start to be last away, trailed most of the way and was never a menace.
CUPID'S MUSIC chased that soft pace off the inside for six furlongs and stopped.

Footnotes
WHERE'S RANDY bothered, in tight start, lacked early foot, steadied in traffic while beginning an advance into the turn, fell back and moved out, relaunced
his bid late in the turn when angled out 5w into lane, took over, lugged in then out abruptly, clear late. CHALECO in some early traffic just off the inside,
dropped inside turn, waited midway on that bend, continued to be covered up through upper stretch, bothered slightly when the winner lugged in just inside
the furlong marker, could not get to that one late. WHELEN SPRINGS back off the pace out in the strip, came five wide for the drive, rallied out in the middle
of the strip to be up for the show. ATTA PARTY broke alertly, narrowly set pace inside, continued to show the way into the lane, faltered in the late going to
lose position. ALLO ENRY broke out to bother the winner, was straightened to race in the second flight off the inside, improved slightly through the stretch.
GENTLEMENS JET pressed the leader for a half off the inside then weakened in the drive. MAX'S HEART forwardly placed for three furlongs in the three
path, began to tire late in the turn. MO VODKA in mid pack outside, raced four wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally when called on.
TWENTYTWENTYREDO off a step slow, was asked to move up inside, checked up in tight quarters into the turn, fell back and did not recover.
JUSTDENNIS lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, lacked a response in the drive. POINT BLANK was outrun while racing five wide through the
turn. MUCHO ROCKET CAT off slowly, trailed throughout. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN INTO THE TURN AND A
CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF CHALECO AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

BOURBON FRONTIER pressed early inside, moved out, engaged the the early leader before a half, dueled into and through the turn, continued to duel
when holding a slight advantage stretch, fully extended to put that rival away in the late going. PATS PROPERTY broke on top, showed the way through the
first turn, dueled with the winner the final half mile, proved stubborn to the end while closest to the inside. SHORTLIST dropped inside to save some ground
in the first turn, continued to race inside through the second turn, moved out, rallied to be clear for the show, not a serious threat to the top pair. LORD
DRAGON broke back, lacked speed, waited in traffic midway on the second turn, dropped inside and got through late in the turn, improved position while not
a serious threat. KERSHAW settled in mid pack out in the strip, three wide through the second turn, improved position while posing a serious threat.
LEADER OF MEN prompted the pace while racing three wide for three quarters and tired. ALEX JOON in the second flight while racing off the inside, had
little left for the drive. LASTCHANCEATGLORY void of speed, four wide for much of the way, lacked a rally when called on for the drive. RIVER ECHO (GB)
tired while racing off the inside. EGO last to leave, remained always back. LAST MARTINI pulled early while well back, failed to rally. HYPERFOCUS tired
while racing four wide.

Footnotes
FAVORITE OUTLAW prompted the early pace up the backstretch off the inside, engaged the leader in the turn, dueled into the lane, kicked strongly clear
through the lane. SLIM MAN behind the pace outside, came four wide out of the turn, proved no match for the winner, clearly second best. INSOLITO set
the pace for a half, faltered when headed by the winner turning for home. IMPROBABLE JOURNEY forwardly placed while racing three wide, weakened in
the drive. ROYAL KING forwardly placed along the in side, asked along late in the turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a late punch. UNSTABLE
PRINCE broke back, lacked speed inside, improved position through the lane while not proving a serious threat. PAID IN FULL saved ground to no avail.
DRIVEN ONE off the pace and the inside, was roused while three wide late in the turn, failed to muster a response. SKYLINE remained always back.
ISLAND MUSIC off a step slow, back off the pace, gave way four wide turn, eased stretch, jogged in and was walked off.

Footnotes
FAN CLUB never far back outside, stalked the pace up the backstretch, advanced and challenged turning for home, disposed of the early leader inside the
furlong ground and drew clear under brisk pressure. PALACE COUP set the pace just off the inside, continued to show the way into the far turn, offered brief
resistance to the winner entering the stretch then could not keep up, fully extended late to save the place. MARTINI BLU forwardly placed inside, came in
the two path for the drive, not enough late for the place. MIACOMET settled in mid pack early, raced in the second flight in the final turn, three wide into the
lane, finished up evenly. INDIMAAJ broke back, raced in mid pack while four wide into the first turn, continued outside, four wide again late in the second
bend, lacked a closing kick. QUARTERBACK DAK broke awkwardly, raced back and outside, four wide second turn, also failed to muster a response in the
drive when called on. CALIBRATE void of early foot just off the inside, continued in the two path final turn, failed to rally. DIVINE ARMOR finished early,
trailed far back.

Footnotes
NEWGRANGE forwardly placed on the outside into the first turn, stalked the run up the backstretch outside, asked for run while four wide late in the second
turn, stalled nearing midstretch, found more late to be clear. BARBER ROAD broke back, five wide into the first turn when lacking speed, continued back the
middle half and into the far turn, four wide through that bend, rallied down the middle part of the strip to be second best, no real threat to the winner. BEN
DIESEL behind the early pace while saving ground, continued to lurk into the final turn, enjoyed a clean trip along the rail to improve into the stretch, drifted
out inside the furlong marker to flattened out, clear of the rest. KAVOD away in good order, took command into the first turn, showed the way up the
backstretch while pulling hard, held the advantage into the lane, faltered late to lose several positions. DASH ATTACK broke with the field, settled off the
pace and the inside, continued in even fashion throughout in lacking a closing kick. CLASSIC MOMENT broke alertly, pressed the leader from the outside,
remained closest to that one the middle half, had little left for when the real running began at the head of the lane. CALL ME JAMAL four wide through the
first turn when off the pace, was three wide through the second bend while still in mid pack, lacked a significant closing response for the drive. OSBOURNE
within striking distance, in the second flight while between horses second turn, came up empty when set down for the drive. COSTA TERRA fell back before
a half then made little in the way of an impace. VIVAR last away, was never involved. IGNITIS void of speed while off the inside, never fired.
DON'TCROSSTHEDEVIL in mid pack for a half, began to back up soon after, well beaten.

Footnotes
BOB'S EDGE broke in to help tighten up inner rivals, off the pace outside, made a strong move to the front while four wide late in the turn, quickly clear into
the lane, maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire under steady handling. HOME BASE broke out a bit but on top, set or forced the pace along the
inside, proved no match for the winner in the drive, came back for the place. SEVEN NATION ARMY in the second flight while racing three wide, ranged up
to loom a threat late in the turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker, shifted out a bit then flattened out to lose the place. BOLDOR void of speed,
dropped inside late in the turn, improved position while no threat to the top three. HOLLIS forwardly placed early inside, shifted out late in the turn to be four
wide into the lane, came up empty for the drive. DOUBLE CROWN bumped when in tight at the start, raced in mid pack early, failed to rally. NASHVILLE
squeezed at the start to be last away, used a bit to move up and contest the pace for a half, had little for the stretch run in weakening. COLLUSION
ILLUSION bumped at the break, was never involved in trailing home.

Footnotes
ETHEREAL ROAD hesitated and bobbled at the break, trailed well back for five furlongs, began a strong move far turn, swung out five wide when moving
smartly into the lane losing considerable ground to the two leaders, finished full of run to win going away at the end. QUICK TO BLAME broke in good order,
set the early pace, dueled the middle half, headed, came back to retake the advantage into the stretch, proved no match for the winner in the late going,
clear for the place. GOIN TO THE SHOW within striking distance along the inside, continued to save ground second turn, steered out when straightened for
home, along for the show, not a serious threat to the top two. CURLY TAIL off a step slow, raced back, asked along three wide in the second turn, turned in
a mild rally to improve position. LIFE ON THE NILE pressed the issue up front off the inside, put a head in front and dueled the middle half, faltered in the
drive. SKATE TO HEAVEN in the second flight off the inside, four wide through the second turn, finished up evenly in lacking a late punch. MUMAYAZ
forwardly placed and four wide into the first turn, continued off the inside while remaining in a forward position, came up empty for the drive. TEN GAUGE in
mid pack and off the inside, four wide through the second turn, also lacked a closing response. KING DOODLE five wide into the first turn, four wide through
the second bend, never a threat. MINICONJOU four wide in the first turn, remained back while in the two path through the second bend, remained back.
MISTICAL CURLIN stumbled at the start, remained always back. SEVEN FLAT rank in the first turn, finished early, well beaten.
