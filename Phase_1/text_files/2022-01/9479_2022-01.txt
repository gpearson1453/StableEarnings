Footnotes
R DOC bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, established a good position down the backstretch, was asked while moving from the rail to the two
path on the turn, shifted three wide at the quarter-pole, chased the runner-up in the stretch, gained on that tired foe into the final sixteenth and got up under
strong urging. KING OF HOLLYWOOD was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside while in hand, vied in the three path on the turn, took a
short lead outside the quarter-pole, turned into the stretch under the crop, shook clear inside the three-sixteenths, remained clear while shortening stride into
the final furlong and was caught while able to hold the place. WRITEITONTHEICE was ridden along while last but one, dropped from the four path to the
two path outside the three-eighths, swung five wide into the stretch, passed foes while remaining on his inside lead until inside the furlong marker, swapped
to the proper lead at that point, gained into the final sixteenth and finished willingly for the show. FAZARO was hustled to the lead, showed the way under
pressure to the outside, vied inside to the two path on the turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole, dropped
back into upper stretch and tired. NECROMANCER stalked the pace on the outside, ranged up in the four path on the turn, made a bid coming to the
five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under the crop and came up empty. IRIE SPICE angled well out in the track early, fell well behind the rest of the field,
moved in late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path and showed little. SMART STORM stumbled moderately at the start then bumped
with a foe, was rank behind horses while rated under tight restraint, dropped back after being let out outside the half-mile pole, came up empty on the turn
and faltered.

Footnotes
STENCIL stumbled at the start and came under coaxing establishing the front shortly after, showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled,
came under light coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and was roused at the three-sixteenths, drew clear under a drive
getting geared down in the final seventy yards to the finish to prevail comfortably on the wire. CANDY MONET chased just off the inside until tucked inside
through the turn advancing at the three-eighths, tipped out to the two path under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper
stretch and kept on to secure the place honors. BOSS CARA four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into
upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. CINDERELLA'S CAUSE chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered just off the
inside into upper stretch and offered no response. LINNY KATE chased five then four wide under a ride from midway on the turn, swung five wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. SUMMARY JUDGMENT forwardly placed three wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn and began
to back away at the three-eighths while in hand, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and was flashed and shown the crop to the right side while
faltering to the finish.

SWEET MIA was hustled from the gate, settled off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, was urged along in the two path on the turn, swung five
wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside while drifting in some, closed well to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole and just held under steady urging.
GREATEST LOVE was ridden along while well back on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, rallied outside into
the final furlong and closed strongly to just miss while able to get the place.'. AWESOME INDRA broke alertly then came in a bit, tracked the pace on the
outside, chased in the three path on the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, turned into upper stretch in the two
path under a drive, remained on his inside lead while battling to the wire and was outfinished but just earned the show. BABA bobbled slightly at the start,
was urged along on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, gained to make a bid in upper stretch then drifted in some, fought on in the final furlong but
was out-kicked then just missed the show. JEN'S BATTLE was ridden along at the rear, saved ground early on the turn, shifted three wide late on the bend
and was no factor. QUALITY STONES brushed with a foe at the start then was carried in some, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the
rail while dropping back a bit on the turn and capitulated. GUNS BLAZING contested the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped to

Footnotes
STONE CREATOR hustled from the gate, ranged up inside to duel with GALAXINA from the get go, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the
inside route into upper stretch, drew off under a drive kept to task. GALAXINA coaxed from the gate, dueled from the two path with the aforementioned foe
to her inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home, got shaken off straightened away and chased the winner home
clear of the rest and along second best. LAOCHI chased two then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch
offering up a mild bid, then weakened in the late stages while well clear of the rest. COSTANTI three paths off the inside down the backstretch, went five
wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued five wide for home and tired. TEMPERMENTAL chased three then four wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered four wide into upper stretch and tired. MISS MALALA six paths off the inside down the backstretch, darted
inside near the half mile pole and saved ground through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
folded. OVER THE SAND chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide for home, faltered, and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
PURPLE HEARTED went to the front, angled in leaving the chute, moved clear coming to the nine-sixteenths, raced inside on the turn, responded well
when asked at the five-sixteenths, extended the advantage coming to the quarter-pole, was put to the whip into upper stretch, drew off under a strong drive
into the final seventy yards then was eased up in the final six to seven strides while much the best. GOOD CULTURE was in tight near the
eleven-sixteenths, settled at the back on the outside, was urged three to four wide on the turn, dropped inward in upper stretch and just got up for the place.
ROYAL REALM angled out early, settled on the outside, went three wide early on the turn then shifted five wide outside the three-eighths, continued five
wide under urging into the stretch and just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show. ROCCO STRONG settled nicely off the pace, chased in the
two path on the turn, dropped back under a drive into the stretch and tired then was caught for the trifecta. BIG CASTLE was urged along on the outside,
chased four wide on the turn and came up empty. PRAYER BOOK was hustled from the start, moved up under urging then chased the pace, saved ground
on the turn and had nothing left. MISTER WINSTON pressed the pace on the outside, dropped back approaching the nine-sixteenths, fell further back in the
three path on the turn and retreated. CHASE THE CAT moved out leaving the chute, was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
WUDDA U THINK NOW bobbled at the break under hustling and established the front to show the way in hand along the inside under pressure from a pair,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and went clear under a drive getting geared down inside the final
sixteenth to the wire. SECRET RULES bumped at the start by MR PHIL, who broke outwards, prompted the pace three wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, continued three wide for home, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to preserve the place honors. COMPETITIVE SAINT
chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors.
BIG ENGINE coaxed from the gate, chased four wide until tucked to the two path half mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four
wide into upper stretch and weakened. RUNNINGWSCISSORS just off the inside briefly after the start, tipped out to chase five then four wide getting placed
to coaxing three furlongs from home, went five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. MR PHIL broke out at the start brushing the off side stall before
bumping with SECRET RULES, came under hustling and prompted the pace just off the inside between foes, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got
shaken off through the latter portion of the turn and continued just off the inside into upper stretch, then faltered in the drive. Please note that due to a
teletimer malfunction the five-eighths split was unavailable.

PLAYWRIGHT bobbled at the start then bumped with a foe, was urged along while well off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came three wide into the
stretch then moved further out, gained outside on the tired leader in the final furlong, was while carried out some late and got up to prevail. MAGNETRON
was well placed down the backstretch, moved out near the nine-sixteenths, went three wide on the turn, gained fast coming to the five-sixteenths, took the
lead outside the quarter-pole then dropped to the two path while moving clear, remained clear under a drive into the final sixteenth, drifted out while
exhausted late and was caught. THREETHEHARDWAY settled on the outside, angled in late on the backstretch, was urged along in the two path on the
turn then driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the leader while still on his inside lead to inside the furlong marker, swapped to the proper lead at that
point, gained on the tiring leader while drifting out some and just missed while clear for the show. LEGIT was last to commence, moved out near the back,
went four wide on the turn, gained five wide into the stretch but flattened out while just able to hold the last spot in the superfecta under very light urging late.
BLOOD MOON angled in towards the rear, saved ground on the turn and improved position without threatening. INVEST bumped with a rival at the start,
contested the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging, dropped back into the stretch and tired.
MARBLE MOON settled early then came under urging at the three-quarter-pole, went three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. FLOWERS FOR LISA
was hustled from the start, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging, dropped back
into the stretch and faded. TRAPPEZE ARTIST settled in fourth position on the outside, was urged four wide on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
BATTLE BLING coaxed from the gate, raced two to three wide through the first turn before settling at the rear of the field two to three wide down the
backstretch, went three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced to take command swinging four wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive under threat from flanking challengers and held gamely loosely between foes at the wire. MISS LESLIE three to four wide
through the opening bend, chased three wide coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, shied out under a left handed
crop a furlong from home, got corrected and shied out again near the sixteenth marker under a repeated left hand stick, then missed at the end. KISS THE
GIRL coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths and was forced to pause off the heels of VIENNA CODE
as that rival began to come to a stop, angled out three wide into upper stretch once MISS LESLIE cleared to the outside and was roused tipping out two
paths at the three-sixteenths, rallied to issue a challenge through the final sixteenth fighting on to the finish while clear of the rest for the show honors.
VIENNA CODE established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside uncontested, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths facing pressure
for the initial time, took the inside route into upper stretch yielding the front, then weakened in the drive. ITS COLD IN DEHERE coaxed from the gate, raced
three then two wide through the first turn, tracked the leader in closest aim from the two path, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, faded through the
latter portion of the turn and went three wide into upper stretch, then tired. EXOTIC WEST stumbled badly at the start pecking the ground and tossing the
rider from the saddle into an agile jogging dismount, gave chase sans rider until apprehended by the outrider and walked off under her own power. There
was a Stewards' inquiry into the start focusing on EXOTIC WEST before the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
MIRACLE NICKY angled in quickly while going to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, controlled the action while inside on the turn, was
challenged while under a drive in upper stretch, repelled the runner-up inside the furlong marker and moved clear again under strong handling. EDDIE THE
GREAT veered in at the start and was off a bit slow, moved up then chased the pace, went around the turn in the two path, gained under a drive to make an
outside bid in upper stretch, battled with the winner into the final furlong and was outfinished while able to get the place. KONG LOVES A FIGHT broke in
and a bit slow, moved out early, angled in with about six furlongs to run, shifted from the three to five path on the turn and finished with good energy for the
show. CAGNEY was coaxed along off the pace, went three wide under stronger encouragement on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to
rally. EMPIRE STATION was coaxed along off the pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn and came up empty. SELL SOMETHING was urged early
then settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and failed to respond. SILVERMILL bobbled and was bumped hard at the start, raced near
the back, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn and failed to threaten. RESILIENT COURAGE broke out then was corrected by the rider, dropped
back while hard ridden, went around the turn in the three path and faltered. SOUTHERN CIVILITY broke in and bumped hard with a foe, was hard held early
