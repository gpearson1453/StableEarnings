Footnotes
MOODY JIM (IRE) set the pace on the inside under a bit of pressure from BEST CHANCE. finally shook free with a quarter mile remaining, drew away in
upper stretch and remained strong to the wire under a drive. CURRENT rated early in the two path, angled four wide leaving the second bend, finished well
through the lane but could not threaten the winner. TARTINI stalked the pace three then two wide on the first turn, remained off the rail in the middle stages,
driven three wide into the lane and finished evenly while earning the show. DUBBY DUBBIE stalked the pace from inside to the stretch, moved off the rail a
bit in the lane but could not respond to right-handed urging and was outkicked for the show. KAZAN (IRE) was off a bit slow to begin, saved ground on the
inside from off the pace, tipped out two wide entering the stretch, lacked room in upper behind a pair of rivals in upper stretch, gained a clear path in final
furlong but could not summon a late rally. BEST CHANCE raced up close and prompted the pace from outside, remained alongside on the far turn then
could not match strides with the leader nearing the quarter pole and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
NORTHERN GEM lagged behind early, traveled along the inside into the turn, angled out and came three wide into the lane, steered out at the top of the
stretch and closed well to drive past the top trio in the final sixteenth. FLAT OUT JOY got bumped from inside at the start, prompted the pace from outside,
kept the pressure on through the turn and into the lane, took over with a furlong to go but was overtaken in deep stretch and saved the place. BELLA
RENELLA brushed the gate and bumped rival at the start, stalked two wide into the turn, asked three wide into the lane, lost the whip midstretch and missed
the place. STARSHIP DEFIANT set the pace under pressure from FLAT OUT JOY, maintained a short lead through the turn and into the stretch,
relinquished the lead with a furlong remaining and weakened in deep stretch. BIG CHICK stalked the pace well off the rail, went three to four wide around
the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
KEYSTONE FIELD stalked the leader in the two path, bid outside with three-eighths remaining, dueled around the turn and took over past the quarter pole,
drifted in a bit and cleared in upper stretch and held safely under a drive. BUILDER sped clear and crossed over to the inside, set the pace to the far turn,
dueled with KEYSTONE FIELD around the bend, was overtaken leaving that turn, stayed on then got put in tight quarters and steadied in upper stretch,
switch to the outside and kept on to gain ground late. STAGE READY was put in tight quarters entering the first turn, settled off the pace inside, moved to
the two path then got put in tight quarters again entering the second bend, steered out in upper stretch and rallied for the show. MOVE OVER (GB) pulled
early nearing the first turn, moved to the inside to stalk the pace, steered out to the two path in the middle stages, came back to the rail for the second bend,
tipped two wide into the lane and lacked the needed late kick. BIG BUZZ bobbled at the start, stalked three wide to the stretch and failed to respond when
called upon. CLEOPATRA'S STRIKE brushed leaving the gate, tracked three wide through both turns and never rallied. FRENCH GETAWAY brushed with
outside rival at the start, went three then two wide around the clubhouse turn, tracked outside a rival or off the rail, went three deep into the far turn, chased
three wide into the lane, steered inside in the stretch but made no impact. FAMILY BIZ stalked the pace along the rail, dropped back on the far turn and tired
in the lane. AFTER AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH KEYSTONE FIELD DID SHIFT IN AND CAUSE BUILDER TO STEADY IN
UPPER STRETCH, IT DID NOT COST BUILDER A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
LIL'S BIG SHOT dueled outside a rival for command, shook free at the five-sixteenths pole, led two wide into the lane and drew off. FOR LOVE NOT
MONEY tossed his head and got sandwiched at the start, went between foes at the quarter pole then shifted to the inside leaving the bend, closed well in
the lane and got up for second. GOLDEN HALO broke in and bumped rival, stalked in the two path through the bend and got outkicked for the place honors.
ELANA MY PRINCESS tracked three deep early, went four then three wide on the turn and weakened. MONGOLIAN DREAM got bumped leaving the gate,
lacked early speed, navigated the turn two then three wide, moved out in the lane and could not rally. ICONIC STORM raced outside a rival at the back,
took the turn four wide and failed to threaten. RETURN TO HARBOR stalked the top pair outside a rival, between foes around the turn, went three wide into
the lane and faded. PHOENIX TEARS dueled for the lead from inside, could not match strides with the winner past the five-sixteenths pole, got put in tight
leaving the turn and tired.

Footnotes
MESUT lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn, lacked room in upper stretch then steered out with a furlong to go, rallied four deep and drove
past in the final sixteenth. AUGUSTA MELODY got bumped from inside and checked early crossing surfaces, stalked the pace from inside then two wide
into the drive, was looking to angle out but was hemmed in by FIRST PREZ in upper stretch, gained a clear path and bid between rivals but was outkicked
by the winner. FIRST PREZ was crowded and had to check crossing surfaces early, was in range early off the inside, chased three wide into the lane, took
a brief lead in the final sixteenth but was outkicked by the top pair. QUICK FINISH jumped the track crossing surfaces early, went two wide around the turn,
angled out in the lane and finished willingly from the far outside. MCWHERTER pressed the pace from outside, headed rival at the five-sixteenths pole,
dueled into the lane, cleared in upper stretch and yielded in the final sixteenth. BIG SCOTT DADDY raced near the back off the inside, took the turn two
wide, steered out in the lane and summoned a mild response. WIPE THE SLATE set the pace up the back stretch inside of MCWHERTER, dueled with that
rival on the turn, lost the lead into the stretch and weakened inside.

Footnotes
MERCY MERCY stalked outside then off the rail, bid between around the far turn and took a short lead, dueled with TAKE A LEAP down the stretch and
drew clear late. TAKE A LEAP tracked early form off the rail, bid three deep on the second bend, dueled four wide into the stretch, battled down the lane
and was bested in the final sixteenth. DESTINY'S JOURNEY took control early in the two path then moved inside, gained company into the far turn, vied for
the lead around the bend and weakened in the lane. HOT ON THE TRAIL tossed his head, hopped and stumbled at the start, traveled two to three wide on
both turns, improved placing in the late stages but failed to threaten. NOBLE CONTESSA stalked the pacesetter from inside, lost ground on the far turn and
came up empty in the lane. GOTTA BE LUCKY took a big hop leaving the gate to come away very slow, moved to the inside early, steered out on the far
turn and came three wide into the stretch and was never a factor. AWESOME DRIVE went three to four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, took the
second turn four to five wide and weakened.

Footnotes
THRILLING was closest in pursuit early on, bid outside leaving the turn, took over then cleared in upper stretch and held well over the runner-up. SENSIBLE
CAT settled in the two path, split foes with a furlong to go and closed well to be gaining to the wire. SPIRIT OF BERMUDA (IRE) stalked the pace from
inside, urged upon leaving the turn, tipped out in the lane and chased within striking distance but could not find the needed late kick in deep stretch. KUORA
(PER) lacked early speed, raced two wide on the turn then angled out leaving the bend, steered widest in the drive and put in a mild late bid to round out the
superfecta. JAVANICA tracked three then four wide on the turn and lacked a late bid. GREG'S DIVA sped clear and crossed over to the inside, showed the
way through the turn, challenged from outside leaving the bend, lost command at the top of the stretch and weakened inside. SHE'S SO NICE (IRE) was
reserved early on and moved to the three path for the turn, drifted out crossing over the dirt surface and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
ADARE MANOR sped to the front from inside, kicked clear around the second bend, then powered away under mild urging in the lane. MICRO SHARE
brushed with MUY CHISTOSA at the start, went two to three wide on the first turn, stalked in the two path in the middle stages then angled in for the far turn,
saved ground to the stretch, could not summon the needed late kick to threaten the runaway winner but stayed on to prove second best. MISS
EVERYTHING bobbled leaving the gate, went up to race three deep into the first turn, moved back to a stalking position, stayed three wide through the
second bend and failed to threaten in the lane. MUY CHISTOSA brushed outside rival leaving the gate, raced up close in the two path early, remained off
the rail up the backstretch, chased outside a rival into the lane and weakened. INDY'S STAR went three then four wide on the first turn, trailed four wide into
the second bend, came three wide into the stretch and was not a factor. SWEET HEIDELBERG was up close four wide into the first turn, dropped back off
the pace, angled to the inside on the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
DRAMATIZER came away a step slow and was reserved in the early going, closed in around the far turn and took aim three wide into the stretch,
challenged CHASINGSERENDIPITY in the final furlong and edged past to prove best. CHASINGSERENDIPITY broke out and bumped at the start, settled
outside a rival, bid two wide leaving the far turn, took over in upper stretch, dueled with DRAMATIZER in the final furlong and yielded grudgingly. VAROMA
received a bump from inside at the start, tracked two wide on the first turn, moved to the inside nearing the second bend, angled three wide leaving the
bend, steered out further in the drive and summoned a mild rally to best the rest. BADGER KITTEN traveled in mid-pack through the early going, went two
wide into the far turn, angled out and closed in four wide entering the stretch but flattened out in the lane. CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) broke a bit slow then
went to the front and cleared on the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch, was collared by rival nearing the stretch, relinquished the lead and
weakened. CECILE'S CHAPTER settled along the inside, shifted two wide on the far turn, waited for room past the quarter pole, found a clear path in the
lane and weakened. WESTWARD BREEZE was off alertly then ceded the lead and stalked from inside, was roused around the far turn but lacked room at
the quarter pole, remained inside to the stretch, tipped out and weakened in the late stages. LILA AT THE BEACH was off slow to begin, went three then
two wide on the first turn, remained two wide to the stretch and came up empty.
