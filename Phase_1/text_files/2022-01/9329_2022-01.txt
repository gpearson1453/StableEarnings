Footnotes
TIME FOR A SONG bobbled a bit at the start, set the pace along the inside from a pair of outer pursuers around the turn, inched clear at the quarter pole as
TIDDLY ranged up, and held sway safely through midstretch before edging further away in the final sixteenth. TIDDLY stalked the leading pair early on,
tipped outside of them approaching the three furlong pole, ranged up entering the lane to attempt a bid outside of a clearing TIME FOR A SONG, but only
managed to chase that rival home, and proved second best. POINT OF VICTORY broke outwardly, tracked the pace in the three to four path around the
turn, claimed show in upper stretch, but failed to threaten the top two late. J Z'S FIRST lagged behind the field around the turn, and passed a tiring foe in the
late stages without factoring. PRINCESS STELLA (IRE) pressed the pace two wide, then from between horses at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened
entering the lane.

Footnotes
SURVEILLANCE raced forwardly placed two wide and between horses early on, stalked patiently around the turn, tipped inside of a biding K C ROCKET in
upper stretch after that foe vacated the inside, drove past that foe leaving the furlong grounds, and cleared. K C ROCKET stalked along the inside, bid
inside of the leader through a large hole in upper stretch, shifted outwardly while forging an advantage, but was outkicked by an inner foe at the furlong pole,
and proved second best. BEDUIN FIGHTER pressed the pace setter from the outside, shifted down the two path into the turn after the leader cleared off,
chased that foe while under urging in the two path, shifted to the four path while regaining stride entering the lane, but was outkicked by a pair of inner foes
in upper stretch, and kept on to safely secure show. PRAIRIE saved ground while tracking from off of the pace, then improved along the inside in midstretch.
ZAP MOTION broke slowly, rushed to stalk three wide, chased under urging around the turn, then shifted to the five path in upper stretch, but failed to
produce a bid. INTHEALY set the pace in the three path early on, cleared off while tucking to the two path into the turn, drifted back to three path entering
the lane as foes closed in on both sides, then weakened between horses in upper stretch. BENBOW CAT showed little.

BLONDIE LOX BABE broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, stalked along the inside, split through a clear opening passing the quarter pole, forged
an advantage in upper stretch, cleared approaching the final furlong, and held sway. PEACEFUL VISION took a bump from an inner foe at the start,
pressed the pace three wide and between horses early on, stalked while tucking down to the three path around the turn, tipped back four wide in upper
stretch to launch a rally, took aim on a clear BLONDIE LOX BABE in the final furlong, but was kept at bay. MANDOLINE STAR hopped slightly at the start,
vied along the inside while staying a path off of the rail, yielded between horses passing the quarter pole, but kept on late to reclaim show from a tiring foe in
the late stages. D'WILD MUFFIN vied two wide while in the three path around the turn, led at the five sixteenths pole, but got headed by a rail bidder
passing the quarter pole, got outkicked for place by an outer rival approaching the final sixteenth, and weakened late. KEHRON'S CREED tracked while
trailing the short field in the four to six path around the turn, came into the lane six wide, and failed to factor. ACTIVE GIRL stalked four wide, took the turn in
the five path, and weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
MY NANNY'S A HOOT was forced inwardly a bit at the start, stalked while well placed along the inside, rated just behind the leaders in the two path around
the far turn, tipped four wide entering the lane, grinded away to bid passing the furlong pole, and forged an advantage late. SKY HIGH SUSAN stalked from
the two to three path around the first turn, prompted the leading pair around the far turn, forged an advantage outside of CANADA'S CUSTOMS passing the
quarter pole, dug in at the furlong grounds as MR NANNNY'S A HOOT loomed, but was bested by that foe in the final sixteenth. MS. CAJUN QUEEN
settled off of the pace in the two path, advanced to track the pace four wide around the far turn, got floated and outkicked by an inner foe at the quarter pole,
but stayed on to grind away through the final furlong, and reached show late. CONNECT IT tracked from the two to three path, then chased between horses
through the lane. CANADA'S CUSTOMS set the pace two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, got headed by an outer foe passing the
quarter pole, yielded to that rival entering the final furlong, then greenly lugged inwardly shortly after requiring rider correction. ANITA'S VISION leaned a bit
inwardly at the start, vied along the inside of a rival, then inside of a pair of foes around the far turn, but yielded at the quarter pole. C C TAKESOVER saved
ground far off of the pace, advanced to midpack around the far turn, then failed to bid in the three path through the lane. SUPER ET settled far off of the
pace in the five to four path around the first turn, took the far turn in the three path, and failed to factor. WHIMSICAL LADY laid off of the pace in the three to
two paths around the turns, and made little impact. THETHRILLERSGONE got outrun.

Footnotes
THUNDER AHEAD set a clear pace in the two path, dug in to resist an inner foe's bid in upper stretch, and lasted from a pair of outer bidders late.
HELLUVA LIFE broke slowly, took the first turn in the three path while off of the pace, advanced inside of foes around the far turn before shifting five wide
entering the lane, and rallied on his left lead through the final furlong, but missed on the wire. FIFTYFIVE STRONG tracked three wide, stalked between
horses around the far turn, chased through upper stretch, kept on late to attempt a bid as an outer foe ranged up, but missed. BOLD MINISTER broke a
step slowly at the start, stalked along the inside, attempted a bid inside of the leader passing the quarter pole, but flattened out late. COUNTRIFIED broke
slowly, saved ground far off of the pace, shifted four wide into the backstretch, advanced outside of foes thereafter, chased while in range of the leader
around the far turn, but flattened out between horses in the final furlong. KILLER BEE tracked from midpack in the four path, swung three to six wide
entering the lane, and failed to factor. AMBASSADOR HOUSE stalked two wide, but weakened between horses into the far turn. ONE HITTER laid in
midpack in the two path around the first turn, but was done early. O'CONNOR refused to leave the gates when they opened, came out many seconds late,
and galloped around the track, and walked off. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY DEEMED O'CONNOR AS A STARTER.

Footnotes
DREAMWORKER pressed the pace two wide around the first turn, vied into the backstretch, led at the half mile pole, cleared approaching the
five-sixteenths, and held sway through the lane under driving pressure. PEARL EARRING broke outwardly, settled off of the pace three wide, chased four
wide and outside of foes around the far turn, then rallied to bid for place outside of SWEET N SASSY at the sixteenth pole, battled, and prevailed. SWEET N
SASSY stalked along the inside, got shuffled back behind a tiring CYPRESS QUEEN at the five sixteenths pole, shifted to the three path at the quarter pole,
rallied between horses to bid for place along with PEARL EARRING a sixteenth from home, but was outfinished for that position. MAXINE MACHINE
tracked two to three wide, but came under urging into the far turn, inched closer to take aim on a clearing DREAMWORKER entering the lane, but only
managed to chase that foe through midstretch before flattening out late. MISTHAVEN (IRE) broke inwardly at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside,
got rank into the first turn, remained unsettled around that bend, moved between horses at the half mile pole to track the leaders, but failed to bid and tired
through the final furlong. FULL FOCUS broke a bit outwardly at the start, laid at the rear along the inside, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and
passed a pair of tiring rivals. BIZYMALINE sat down in the gate pre-race, then got pinched between horses at the start, raced at the rear in the four path
around the first turn, and never got involved. CYPRESS QUEEN set the pace along the inside, got headed by an outer foe at the half mile pole, gave way
into the far turn, and weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
ECLIPSED tracked the pace from the two path around the turn, came into the lane two wide, shifted in for clear sailing in upper stretch, rallied to bid inside
of the leader at the sixteenth pole, and edged ahead. ARLYNE'S CROWN set the pace in the two path, held sway through upper stretch, but was bested by
an inner foe a sixteenth out. TRIPLE P stalked the pace setter from the three path, chased between horses passing the quarter pole, brushed with an outer
foe at the three sixteenths, then again at the furlong grounds while securing show, but lacked a punch in the late stages to threaten the top two. HAVE I
EVER broke outwardly multiple paths, tracked the pace from the four path around the turn, gained mildly entering the lane to vie for place in upper stretch,
but brushed with an inner foe at the three sixteenths pole, and again at the furlong pole while leveling off. SECRET MELODY broke outwardly, and never
got involved. VERDANDI laid close up along the inside early on, stalked around the turn, but weakened at the three sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
ELLE Z set a pressured pace along the inside, shook clear at the quarter pole, widened under vigorous hand urging through upper stretch, and was ridden
out to the wire. SHE CAN'T SING laid off of the pace two wide, got slightly shuffled back behind a hard held AIN'T NO ELMERS into the turn, shifted three
wide shortly after, swung six wide entering the lane, but bumped with the aforementioned foe at the quarter pole, produced a good kick and rallied outside of
rivals through the lane, bid for place at the sixteenth pole, and prevailed over an inner foe for that position. TIME LIMIT saved ground off of the pace, moved
out entering the lane, but was held up behind traffic at the quarter pole, shifted inwardly shortly after, rallied along the rail through the lane to bid for place at
the sixteenth pole, but was outfinished. YES IT'S GINGER bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked along the inside, tipped three wide at the quarter
pole, chased between horses to bid for place among rivals a sixteenth from home, but was outkicked by foes on either side. BEYOND MYBUDGET broke a
step slowly at the start, raced at the rear four wide around the turn, shifted inwardly in upper stretch, and moved up late. PAYNTDEMBLUESAWAY pressed
the pace setter three to two wide, but failed to keep pace with that rival passing the quarter pole, held place into the final furlong, but weakened between
horses at the sixteenth pole. AIN'T NO ELMERS bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked two wide and between horses, minorly lost position under
restraint into and around the turn, shifted five wide entering the lane, but was shut off when an inner foe drifted out at the quarter pole, steadied due to the
incident, then failed to factor. ELLE'S TOWN tracked four wide, stalked three wide around the turn, but was herded out by an inner shifting foe at the quarter
pole, took away an outer rival's path in the process, then lacked a rally before weakening through the final furlong.

Footnotes
LOVELY LADY MAY stalked the clear leader from the outside around the turn, bid entering the lane sparking a duel, but bumped with his inner counterpart
at the three sixteenths pole, briefly failed to keep pace shortly after, but sustained his chase, came again in the late stages, and got up on the wire.
CANDY'S PRIDE sped clear early on, showed the way around the turn, met LOVELY LADY MAY's bid at the quarter pole, bumped with that foe at the three
sixteenths pole while sharing the blame, forged ahead shortly after, but failed to kick away, met that foe's rebid in the late stages, and got nailed on the wire.
PINEAPPLE ALLEY stumbled at the start before being bumped by an inner foe, raced far off of the pace three wide around the turn, shifted inwardly and
bothered ISN'T IT TIME in upper stretch while picking up stride, and rallied to split foes at the sixteenth pole to reach show. DREWSILLA was rated back
after a furlong to race far off of the pace, shifted four wide entering the lane, and moved up between horses in the closing stages. RUN NATALIE RUN laid
off of the pace two to three wide, shifted four wide entering the lane, but failed to threaten. BOSTON MILLIE tracked two wide, shifted to the three path in
upper stretch, chased the dueling leaders without progressing through midstretch, and tired late. STOP SHOP N DROP tracked along the inside, chased
along the rail through the lane, but tired late. CLASSICAL MAGNOLIA raced off of the pace three to four wide, came into the lane five wide, and failed to
factor. ISN'T IT TIME laid far back two wide, cleared an inner foe at the quarter pole, but was hindered by an outer foe in upper stretch, and lacked a rally.
MO BELLA broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, saved ground far off of the pace, but faded. WINNIE B got outrun. THE RIDER OF CANDY'S
PRIDE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF LOVELY LADY MAY FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH, BUT THE OBJECTION
RESULTED IN NO CHANGE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.
