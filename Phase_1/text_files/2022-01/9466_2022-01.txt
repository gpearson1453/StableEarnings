BRIAN'S IRON MIKE vied for the early lead, saved ground, drove clear down the home stretch and was kept to the task. SIMPLY WICKED challenged for
the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, drifted out down the home stretch and was a clear second at the wire. DANCIN WITH ANGELS was an
early factor, raced close throughout, came around the final turn on the outside and proved no match for the top two. HOME VISIT raced near the middle of
the field, saved ground around the second turn and put forth an even effort. GHOST COWBOY lacked early speed, came around the second turn on the
outside, entered the stretch wide and lacked a bid. DONNIE BOY was unruly in the gates, broke a step slow and never mounted a bid.

PERFECT MISTAKE raced within contention, came around the second turn three wide, rallied and drove clear before the wire. KING NATE pressed the
pace, saved ground around the final turn, made a bid down the home stretch, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. FLAT OUT LOVE
lacked early speed, raced outside around the second turn, made a wide gain and got up for show. CAPE TOWN WILLY vied for the early lead, briefly took
the advantage, but lacked a late kick. PAT ME DOWN went to the front, drove clear and faded. WAYPOINT void of early speed and was never a factor. HE
HAD A SECRET raced near the middle of the field, came around the final turn wide and showed little. RED BUFFALO always raced near the back and was
outrun.

Footnotes
CLEVER PRINCE lacked early speed, moved up around the final turn, split rivals entering the stretch, rallied and was going away at the end. LULLABY
BANDIT dueled for the early lead, saved ground, forwardly placed throughout, but proved no match for the winner late. TOOCAN DANCE raced within
contention, came around the first turn on the outside and was outfinished for second. SASSY'S PROSPECTOR raced within striking distance, came around
the turn three wide, made an outside bid and missed third. CYBER GUN lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. TENPINS
TERRITORY raced near the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. HIGH PRIORITY raced in the middle of the pack in the beginning and faded.
TDZ WHAT A DREAM broke a step slow, raced in the rear and was never a threat. LOUISIANA TRIP vied for the early lead, dropped back, lost contact with
the field and was eased to the wire.
