PERFECTINGTHEVIEW pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, dug in gamely through the final stages and proved best under strong handling.
POLISHED GEM away alertly, set the pace until deep stretch and finished second best while three wide. SOMUCHSUGAR swung five wide leaving the
clubhouse turn, dropped inside entering the second turn, loomed boldly along the rail in upper stretch then was outfinished. LIBERTY BELLE hopped at the
start, offered a mild bid four wide on the far turn then leveled off. STARSHIP MACYS stalked the pace three wide, inched closer midway on the far turn then
failed to sustain that bid. FLAXEN trailed.

PRINCESS HALIME stalked the pace along the inside into the turn, shifted out, rallied determinedly in the seven path under right handed urging and got up
in time. ORBIT MARS broke in front, gave up the lead soon thereafter, chased the leader into the stretch, rallied to make the lead in the six path nearing the
furlong marker and just missed hanging on. COWGIRL KIMMIE sped to the lead two wide soon after the start, set the pace until mid stretch then weakened
and drifted out nearing the wire. LUCKY TO HAVE ME saved ground to no avail. JOLIE RULER failed to menace. LIVE IT UP was through early.

BROKEN JEWEL away alertly, set the pace in the four then five paths for a half then weakened late. WEEKENDING close up along the inside, failed to
respond. UNEXPECTEDVALENTYN failed to menace. CANELA FINA was no threat. PUNCHCORN was outrun. DOZZA was no threat, stopped in the

MISS OVER THERE with the second flight between horses, improved near the inside through the turn, shifted out to the seven path entering the stretch,
rallied under left handed urging and was along in time. LA MUNECA away alertly, set the pace with a clear lead until deep stretch while in the five path the
couldn't handle the winner. CHARGAREE never far back, saved ground and finished determinedly. OUT ATTHE SPEEDWAY stalked the pace from the five
path and went evenly. PRINCESS CONSUELA failed to menace. FANCY EMPRESS trailed into the stretch then passed tiring rivals outside. FLOWZANO
had speed for three furlong then faded. ESPECIALLY YOU chased the leader through the turn then flattened out. ORBETTE settled mid pack and gave way
in the stretch.

Footnotes
SPECIAL ASSISTANT chased the pace from the inside into the stretch, shifted out to the four path, rallied under right handed urging to make the lead late
and drew clear under a strong hand ride. SOULSTONE was hustled to the lead along the inside soon after the start, set the pace until deep stretch then was
no match for the winner and held on for second. I MATTER trailed through the turn then, closed willingly in the two then four paths through the stretch and
just missed getting up for second. IRON WILMA moved up three wide on the turn then leveled off. TIME FOR CUPID failed to menace.
LEMONSANDDIAMONDS chased the pace into the stretch then faded. DANCING FOR MONEY was no threat. LUNA MIA had speed into the turn, stopped
and returned bleeding from the nostrils.

EL SICARIO broke in front, set all the pace and finished full of run under right handed urging to win going away. PASION AZTECA saved ground through
the far turn, shifted to the four path at the top of the stretch and finished second best. JOE BRRRR chased the winner into the stretch, drifted out a bit when
put to a left handed stick near the three sixteenths pole then was outfinished. OLD FORTY FIVE went evenly. PRETTY LOUD failed to menace.
AUTOPOLIS had speed for a half then weakened. BAHAMIAN BEAT chased the winner early and was through after a half. THE RIDER OF OLD FORTY
FIVE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF JOE BRRRR FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH. AFTER

Footnotes
SUSHI Q away alertly, set all the pace under pressure and wore down rivals in a game effort. NICEASAKITTENSEYES never far back, closed willingly four
then three wide and finished second best. LUCKY PENNY ROSE trailed through the far turn then found her best stride late four wide. CAUSE OF LOVE
stalked the early pace, moved up four then three wide after a half, pressured the winner until deep stretch then was outfinished. QUEEN HIGH stalked the
pace three wide, dropped inside on the far turn, loomed boldly at the top of the stretch then came up empty. I GOT HOPE pressed the pace two wide and
was through after a half.
