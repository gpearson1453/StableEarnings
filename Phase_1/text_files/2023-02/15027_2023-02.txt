path around the first bend, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the
far turn and finished evenly. CRAFTY KING saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the second bend in the two
path and showed no kick. FUNNY MAN hopped up mildly leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch,
continued to save ground around the far turn and made no bid. ARCH RUNNER raced in the four path around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the
