Footnotes
EARLY FROST was reserved early, advanced between rivals on the turn, angled out leaving the three sixteenths and closed well on the left lead to get up in
deep stretch, driving. DWELLER was well placed early two wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to take over, then was clear leaving the furlong marker
but was caught late, second best. NO EASY ANSWER after having a shoe repaired in the paddock, set the pace on the inside, then was headed on the turn
and weakened the final furlong, bested rest. ALWAYS MIA chased the pace on the inside and had no rally. TOOTSYSROCKNROLLER was fractious in the
gate, lacked a rally. COACH HAS SIX ACES was settled early, four wide on the turn and had no rally. SUNSHINE LINDA was off slowly and not a factor.
ONE TOUGH ROSE was fractious in the gate, stumbled at the start, chased the pace three wide and stopped.
