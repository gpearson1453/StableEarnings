outside SUPER ACCELERATE near the sixteenth pole then drove clear. SUPER ACCELERATE set the pace slightly off the rail, failed to fend off the winner
in the drive but finished gamely. MINE RUN stalked the pace in the two path down the backstretch, moved to the three path leaving the turn and failed to
rally. DISPUTED CLAIM lunged at the break, advanced four deep entering the turn, chased the pace and weakened. OROCOVIX , three wide leaving the
backstretch, chased the pace to the stretch and weakened. RECTOR bore in at the start then was outrun. TRUE ACCOUNT gave way on the turn and was
eased late.

Footnotes
UNCOMMON VALOR , well off of a contested early pace while between rivals, angled out mid turn, circled five to six wide into the lane, leveled off under left
handed asking in mid stretch, sustained and rolled by from the outside with a sixteenth to go and edged clear late. DESPITE ODDS dueled inside under
rating, moved clear without much asking past the three eighths, opened up under a hand ride leaving the quarter pole, wandered outward a bit while on his
left lead, dug in when joined near the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. THRUSTER edged up between foes after a bit of a slow start, chased mid
turn, angled in to advance near mid stretch then flattened out late. LOVE MACHINE was rated four wide outside foes early, moved up some while under a
hustling ride mid turn, came five wide for the drive but failed to seriously kick on. PLUNK stalked while saving ground, was pushed along around the turn,
had some interest near mid stretch then flattened out. GOD IS LOVE , sluggish from the gate, was taken wide and failed to menace. NO ME DIGAS , three
to four wide stalking the embattled leaders, saw the leader kick away past the three eighths, was under hard chase four wide into the stretch then
weakened. DEJOHN vied outside DESPITE ODDS, failed to kick on heading towards the stretch and gave way. BETTHEOVER saved ground while in
range early, dropped back nearing the turn, angled wide and failed to respond.

Footnotes
DECOUPAGE rated three deep while stalking the early pace, took closer order under some coaxing mid turn, bid to take over with three sixteenths
remaining, edged clear a sixteenth later, remained on her left lead and widened under some light right handed asks. STARTWITHABANG lagged well back,
was urged along mid turn, swung six wide and closed belatedly to nab the place. ITALIAN DRESSING rated towards the inside, moved up a bit when eased
out leaving the far turn, shifted five wide for the drive and continued on willingly. BEHIND THE COUCH , under a snug hold and behind rivals heading to the
turn, angled out and pursued four wide past the five sixteenths, stayed on to mid stretch then faded. A GIRL NAMED JAC saved ground, was lightly
steadied leaving the far turn then lacked a serious recovery. LA FAMILIA cleared early, set the pace towards the rail, could not contain the winner leaving
the three sixteenths, stayed on a bit longer then faded. NO MORE MASK stalked two wide, failed to kick on under pressure past the five sixteenths and
weakened.

weakened. MAJOR HOULIHAN , along the inner rail on the turn, swung wide in upper stretch and retreated. IMAGINETHEODDS lacked speed, raced along

Footnotes
UNDER THE RADAR saved ground in mid pack, took closer order while saving ground into the lane, was guided out past mid stretch, closed in under
strong left handed asking, kept on determinedly while drifting out and forged ahead in the final yards. FRIGHTLAND eagerly made his way forward and to
the inside of rivals, bid to join FIND FAITH past the three quarter pole, vied under rating, held a slim lead leaving the far turn, shook free while still in hand
approaching the stretch, came under right handed asking when guided a bit off the rail soon after, remained well clear leaving mid stretch, switched over to
his left lead departing the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. BRILLIANT ICE rated off the early pace and off the inside, worked his way forward while
three wide and between runners into the stretch, closed in under pressure and to the outside of the winner, was herded out by that one through the final
seventy yards, switched to his left lead and stayed on willngly. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY prompted the early pace between foes, was rated back past the three
quarter pole, steadied heading to the turn, angled out five wide, circled under pressure into the stretch and continued with interest. GALLANT GOLD rated
forwardly off the inside, chased four wide between runners into the stretch but came up empty. BRETT'S WORLD , off the pace and saving ground, angled
out in upper stretch, shifted back in and had a mild response. BATON , bumped at the break, stalked off the rail, was under pressure four wide into the
stretch and faded. FIND FAITH , bumped at the start, sped to the lead off the rail, was joined from his inside after a quarter mile, dueled into and around the
turn, failed to match strides into the stretch and weakened. ROYAL NUMBER was shuffled leaving the chute and failed to menace. THE ADDISON POUR
drifted out early, raced four wide past the five eighths and failed to respond. BLAMEITONTHEFUN , three wide, was outrun.

Footnotes
FREE SQUARE bumped with PEPE AND HEYWOOD soon after the start, raced outside horses off the duel, moved up four deep at the head of the stretch,
swept to command near the eighth pole, was kept to his business and drew away. NO MORE TALK , well off the duel for a half mile, saved ground on the
turn, swung wide in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. WILD BEHAVIOR disputed the pace outside GREAT GO GO and weakened the final furlong.
GREAT GO GO showed inside speed, saved ground on the turn disputing the pace and weakened late. SHOULDA HAD IT lacked speed, swung to the five
path in upper stretch, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. PEPE AND HEYWOOD stumbled at the break, bumped with the winner soon after the
start, failed to be a factor and was kept four wide on the turn. BOONDOGGLE chased the early pace, raced near the inner rail on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
TORCH OF TRUTH rated in range while saving ground early on, shifted out near the half, circled four to five wide advancing into the lane, rallied outside
foes and cleared in mid stretch then edged away under left handed asks. RUBY BLEU vied outside a rival under rating, moved clear into the turn, failed to
contain the winner nearing mid stretch but stayed on well to save the place. PLOT THE DOTS stalked three wide, was shoved along mid turn, shifted out
near mid stretch and churned on without really threatening. INDIAN LAKE , a bit keen attending the pace to the inside of RUBY BLEU, steadied near the five
eighths, checked near the half, regrouped to make a run past the three eighths, eased out into the stretch, chased and faded.

LUIGI'S SPIRIT , patiently handled down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, remained inside horses in upper stretch, swung outside in mid
stretch, took the lead late and drove clear. CROSSLAND disputed the pace outside DOMINGUEZ, sprinted clear in upper stretch and failed to hold off the
winner. YOUR ANALYSIS lacked speed, was taken to the six path in upper stretch and failed to menace. DOMINGUEZ showed speed along the inner rail,
dueled to mid stretch and gave way. SUCCEED was outrun. THE GREAT GAZOO stalked the pace, was poised to strike four wide turning for home,
faltered and was eased late. RARE BREED , three wide on the turn, gave way and was eased.
