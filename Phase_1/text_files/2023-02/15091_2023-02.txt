Footnotes
FEELING FLUSH asked to show speed from the break and was hustled to the early lead, cleared the field into the first turn, was well rated through decent
fractions to the far turn, given a few reminders in upper stretch and pulled away in the final stages as much the best. RHONDA'S COOKIN forwardly placed
into the first turn, tracked the decent fractions while closest to the pacesetter through the backstretch run, was able to make a bit of headway on FEELING
FLUSH in upper stretch but was no match for the winner in the drive and stayed on to be second best. FUNKY GREY took back off of the decent early pace,
saved ground to the far turn, lacked a rally in the drive and just held for third. CHELINA unhurried in the early going, maintained a two wide trip to the
second turn, lacked a late response and just missed for show in the final strides.

Footnotes
SASQUATCH RIDE allowed to settle, improved position on the turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed fast inside of the furlong marker, came to even
terms with DICK BEST inside of the sixteenth-marker and determinedly won the nod on the wire. DICK BEST vied for the early lead then took back to stalk
the decent fractions into the turn, chased three wide to the quarter marker, advanced to come within aim in mid-stretch, vied for the lead in deep stretch, met
the bid of SASQUATCH RIDE in the final strides and was gamely bested. GOOD FOCUS disputed the early pace then assumed command nearing the turn,
set decent fractions while pressured to the quarter marker, shook free off of the turn, dug in to hold foes at bay inside of the furlong marker, could not match
strides with the top pair in deep stretch and held for third in the end. DR. FLASH DANCER contested the solid early pace, pressed GOOD FOCUS to the
quarter marker, lost ground to that rival nearing the furlong grounds and weakened in the late stages. GATOR SHINING tracked the decent early pace,
saved ground to the top of the lane, offered an inside bid nearing mid-stretch, could not sustain that run in the late stages and flattened out. JUST WATCH
ME NOW chased the decent early pace, was hard to place on the turn while not cornering well, lost ground into the stretch run, offered a mild late rally but
was unable to threaten in deep stretch.

BEROLIJEAN (FR) took back in the early stages, tracked the leaders through decent fractions to the second turn, advanced nearing the quarter marker,
mounted a four wide bid into the stretch run, came within aim inside of the furlong marker, encountered a stubborn foe in LUCK LUCK IS GOLDEN in deep
stretch and made a late surge to prevail in the final strides. LUCK IS GOLDEN prominent into the first turn, contested the pace with BIG STORY then
assumed command into the backstretch run, was confronted nearing the quarter marker and turned away BIG STORY in upper stretch, held foes at bay to
mid-stretch, confronted by BEROLIJEAN nearing the sixteenth-marker, battled stubbornly against that rival and grudgingly gave way in the final strides,
while besting the rest. BIG STORY forwardly placed into the first turn, attended to the moderate fractions to the half-mile marker, confronted LUCK IS
GOLDEN nearing the quarter pole and was repelled in that effort heading into the drive, weakened inside of the furlong marker and outfinished PORT O'
CALL to secure third. PORT O' CALL lacked early speed, well placed through the backstretch run, saved ground to the quarter marker, advanced in the
drive, was outfinished in the final stages and just edged for third in the final strides. AWESOME CURLIN unhurried in the early stages, swung four wide for
the drive and finished evenly in the final furlong. DANNY MICHAEL allowed to settle, raced two then three wide on the far turn and did not threaten in the
stretch. TIZ A THRILL away in good order and showed early speed into the first turn, stalked the decent fractions through the backstretch run, advanced on
the second turn, dropped back in the stretch run and tired in the final stages.

TALK ABOUT AUTISM broke in slightly and crowded IRISH ROYALTY at the start, tracked the solid early pace, raced two wide while reserved on the turn,
roused nearing the quarter marker, angled four wide into the stretch run, closed determinedly while on the left lead in mid-stretch, headed CAPTIVATING
BOY in deep stretch and wore that foe down to prevail. CAPTIVATING BOY stalked the decent early pace, raced three wide on the turn, loomed in upper
stretch, overtook IRISH CORN inside of the furlong marker and took command, met the late bid of TALK ABOUT AUTISM nearing the sixteenth-marker and
was bested by the winner in the final strides, while just holding for place. COUSIN RICHIE unhurried in the early going, saved ground on the turn, swung to
the four path for the drive, trailed to mid-stretch, closed with a rush in the late stages and just missed for place, while clear of the rest for show. IRISH CORN
broke alertly, engaged with JERRY JEFF WALKER in the early stages and dueled inside of that rival while carving solid early fractions, felt pressure from
CAPTIVATING BOY nearing mid-stretch, could not hold that one off and weakened in the final furlong. JERRY JEFF WALKER showed speed and disputed
the solid early pace, pressed the pace to the outside of IRISH CORN to the quarter marker, lost position in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages.
IRISH ROYALTY chased the solid early fractions, saved ground to the top of the lane, lost ground in upper stretch and lacked a late rally.

Footnotes
OLIVIA'S CHOICE (IRE) crowded at the start and was off a step slowly, chased from the rear in the early stages, advanced while two wide on the turn,
came in tight and took up nearing the quarter marker, shifted four wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed fast in deep stretch, came within aim
of MISS IVES inside of the sixteenth-marker and was up in time to prevail. MISS IVES rated off of the solid early pace, advanced three wide on the turn,
angled four wide for the drive, made a quick move and collared SNIP in mid-stretch, was all out to hold off the oncoming winner in deep stretch and was
gamely bested in the final strides, while clear of the rest for place. KITTEN CALLS forwardly placed in the early stages, advanced three wide on the turn,
chased MISS IVES to mid-stretch, could not make headway on the top pair in the late stages and was clear for third in the end. ZAFFERANA broke out and
crowded OLIVIA'S CHOICE at the start, chased the solid early pace while outside of rivals, raced five wide to the quarter marker, was outrun in upper
stretch and gave way in the drive. SNIP broke alertly, showed good early speed and dictated terms to the turn, set solid fractions to the quarter marker, was
collared by MISS IVES nearing the furlong pole and faded in the final stages. LADY GREGORY raced close to the solid early pace, vied between runners
on the turn, asked for run at the top of the lane and weakened in the stretch. DAREDEVIL PRINCESS forwardly placed in the early going, raced along the
inside while on a hold to the turn, raced in traffic while still under a hold to the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
DRUIDIC allowed to settle in the early stages, reserved through the backstretch run, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch run, came within aim in
mid-stretch, responded to firm urging in the late stages, assumed command in deep stretch and kept to task in the final strides to prevail. HOT JOURNEY
tracked the dueling pacesetters in the early stages, chased SMOKIN' HOT to the quarter marker, assumed command in upper stretch, was set down for the
drive, could not hold off the winner in deep stretch and was second best. SMOKIN' HOT showed good early speed leaving the break, engaged with
SUBURBAN PRINCE and dueled through fast fractions to the second turn, disposed of that rival and was confronted nearing the top of the lane, battled with
HOT JOURNEY to mid-stretch, weakened in the final stages and was clear for third in the end. PROSPECT OF RAIN unhurried in the early going, mounted
a four wide into the stretch run, could not sustain that effort and flattened out in the final furlong. CALI CONQUEST tracked the quick early pace from the
second flight, saved ground to the quarter marker, tipped three wide for the drive and did not threaten in the late stages. SUBURBAN PRINCE hustled
leaving the start, engaged with SMOKIN' HOT and dueled through fast fractions with that rival to the half-mile marker, could not keep pace heading to the
far turn and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
FOURTH STREET broke alertly and was sent to establish the early lead, set a pressured pace to the turn, carved out moderate fractions while pressed to
the quarter marker, shook free leaving the turn and extended the lead to mid-stretch, dug in when challenged again by EM N HOLL'S FIESTA in the final
sixteenth and held on for the win. EM N HOLL'S FIESTA showed good early speed and pressed the early pace, kept pressure on FOURTH STREET while
outside of that rival along the turn, lost ground in upper stretch, re-rallied inside of the furlong marker, made one last surge but was denied in that effort by
the determined winner and was second best. GIANT KID chased the decent early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, could not keep pace with the top
pair in the drive and stayed on to be clear for show in the final stages. OH ANGEL tracked the moderate pace, came under a hold heading to the turn,
chased from the inside on the turn and lacked a late rally. TOPPER'S CHIEFTESS tracked the early pace, came under a hold nearing the turn, chased the
moderate pace two wide to the quarter marker and did not have a late response.

Footnotes
SEE THROUGH IT exchanged a few bumps with PSYCHO DAR leaving the break then was shuffled back in the early going, tracked the speed from the
second flight heading to the turn, saved ground midway through the turn then angled four wide approaching the top of the lane, was full of run in mid-stretch,
closed with a rush inside of the sixteenth-marker to catch TOP HARBOR and kept to task in the final strides to prevail. TOP HARBOR tracked the fast early
fractions, advanced from the two path on the turn, lacked room nearing the quarter marker, tipped three wide for the stretch run, battled with HIGHLAND
GHOST to mid-stretch, took a narrow lead inside of the furlong pole, was all out to hold off SEE THROUGH IT in deep stretch and was outfinished in the
final strides, while besting the rest. HIGHLAND GHOST broke alertly, pressed the fast early pace while outside of BURNIN TURF, dueled with that foe to the
quarter marker, took command in upper stretch, battled with TOP HARBOR to the furlong grounds, weakened in the final stages and was clear for third in
the end. PSYCHO DAR traded a few bumps with SEE THROUGH IT leaving the break but was away in good order, chased the fast early pace from the
inside, was steered three wide on the turn, angled five wide into the stretch run, ran evenly in the late stages and did not offer a late rally. BOBBY'S ALIBI
content to settle in the early going, saved ground on the turn and made a mild late rally in the drive. ULTIMATE BANGO was away in good order, came in
tight and took up in the first furlong, chased the pace to the turn, raced four wide to the quarter marker, lost ground leaving the turn and finished evenly in
the final furlong. JIMMY BLUE JEANS forwardly placed in the early going, chased the fast pace three wide on the turn, shifted four wide for the drive, lost
ground nearing mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages. BURNIN TURF hustled leaving the break and showed good early speed, set a pressured pace
to the turn, dueled inside of HIGHLAND GHOST to the quarter marker, could not keep pace in the drive and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
SUPERMAZEL broke well and was hustled to grab the early lead going into the first turn, relaxed nicely while setting very moderate uncontested splits, had
the measure of the challengers passing the quarter pole, responded when challenged by ANITANEWMERCEDES at the top of the stretch, dueled that one
to the wire, gained the upper hand in the final sixteenth and prevailed in a game effort. ANITANEWMERCEDES saved ground while tracking the pace to the
far turn, began a sustained bid with three furlongs to go, had to steady slightly near the three-eighths pole, got to the flank of SUPERMAZEL at the head of
the stretch, battled that rival to the wire but was never able to pass while clearly second best. SIPPIN N KISSIN lacked speed from the break, saved ground
through the first turn, moved out a path while creeping closer to the leader down the backstretch, made a mild, sustained rally from the three-eighths pole
and kept to task to gain third while never a threat to the top pair. CHIEF JACKSON was not asked for speed from the gate, raced near the back of the field
for the first half of the race, kept to the inside through the far turn then was boxed in until the stretch, found some room turning for home and finished up with
some late interest. WALKING BOSS unhurried early, angled over towards the rail going into the clubhouse turn then swung to the outside in the clear,
continued three or four wide down the backstretch, was still in last position with three furlongs to run, was asked in earnest near the five-sixteenths pole,
swung five wide for the stretch run but only managed to pass one late. THEYREMINISCEOVERU broke alertly and was hustled to gain position into the
clubhouse turn, was content to sit off just off the lone pacesetter to the far turn while racing in the two path, moved to challenge for the lead approaching the
quarter pole then stalled and was unable to keep up down the lane.
