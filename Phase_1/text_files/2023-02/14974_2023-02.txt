Footnotes
SWEET LADY LANA broke sharply to duel for the early advantage with DISCOVER A WISH while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a sixteenth
to run and held off the closing PAYNT THE KITTY to prevail. PAYNT THE KITTY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn
and finished with good energy. DISCOVER A WISH was away alertly to dispute the pace with the winner from the inside, vied with that rival into mid-stretch
and gave way. LITTLE LILY LU lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. ROSEBUD RYDE was pinched back at the
start, lagged early, moved three-wide through the turn and did not menace. PROJECT LOGIC settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn
and gradually weakened. R HAPPY PLACE raced off the pacesetters and weakened after the opening quarter.

DISCERNMENT stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to gain command with a furlong to run and quickly drew off. SINGLE LADY was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished with a steady bid to gain the
place. WHERE'S FRANKIE sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, responded when challenged by the winner in mid-stretch, vied
with that rival and gave way through the final sixteenth. MS PARKSIDE was forwardly placed from the inside early and failed to gain in the drive. GO GO
SADIE was void of early foot, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. KYNLIE'S EMPIRE was off slow
then allowed to settle, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SPUN LINE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and
weakened.

early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with a late bid. CAPITAL HEAT raced off the pacesetters early,
moved five-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished with late interest. A ROZE AND WINE broke sharply to duel for the lead with
the winner from the inside and gave way after going a half. RODEO ROSE lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the
stretch and did not offer a bid. AIN'T SHE DAHRLIN showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. DOZO was void of

RACE HOME raced four-wide through the first turn, was unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths
pole, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew clear. UNMACHABLE lacked early speed, was bumped into the lane, drifted in to bump rival in
mid-stretch and finished willingly when clear. MYOPIC was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, was bumped and
checked late and finished evenly. SHINNY settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out and was bumped nearing the
three-sixteenths pole, checked in mid-stretch and lost best chance. THE BLACK STRAT pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid
nearing the nine-sixteenths pole, opened a clear margin and gave way through the final furlong. AX MAN pressed the pace while racing four-wide and

Footnotes
POVERTY BAY broke sharply to stalk the pace of A VIEW FROM ABOVE, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and
drew clear. GOLD RUSH CANDY was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the lane and finished with a steady
bid. A VIEW FROM ABOVE sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and gave way in the drive. TOIL AND TROUBLE lagged early,
moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with some late run. ABRAAJ MIRAGE was off a step slow, lacked early
speed, saved ground through the turn and failed to reach contention. BOLD VOYAGER settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and
lacked the needed rally. TOOL TIME showed brief speed, raced three-wide through the turn and weakened.
