Footnotes
PROMISEHER AMERICA bobbled at the start then drifted in, was well placed behind the leading duo, moved closer with five furlongs to run, drafted in the
two path early on the turn, shifted four wide while roused outside the five-sixteenths, rallied to the lead into upper stretch then kicked clear, drew away under
the crop to the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a strong hand-ride to the wire while much the best. AVANT settled on the outside, moved closer
midway down the backstretch, issued a challenge at the seven-sixteenths, vied in the three path around the turn and proved no match for the winner while
able to get the place. UNDOUBTEDLY was hustled from the start, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive and weakened while well clear for the show. LA GROTTE was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the outside, was urged
along between foes in the two path on the turn, dropped back outside the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch and capitulated. DON'T TELL
AMY dropped well behind early, was urged two then three wide around the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
CAN'T BEAT ME five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and was up in the final
jumps to prevail. CUMBERLAND BLUES bumped between foes at the start who each broke his way, came under hustling and dueled from the two path with
MISBEHAVED to his outside, tucked inside through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear
under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in growing a bit leg weary in the late stages and was caught in the final strides to the finish. B C GLORY DAYS broke
out at the start bumping the aforementioned foe in tandem with GOT THE GOLD, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside
through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and kept on to secure the show honors. BOURBON'S HOPE shied in at
the start filling the space left vacant by GOT THE GOLD, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then two wide into the turn coming under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, floated three wide at the three-eighths impeding GOT THE GOLD and forcing that rival to steady off his heels at that
station, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. GOT THE GOLD broke through the gate prior to the start and was reloaded, broke in at the start
bumping CUMBERLAND BLUES in concert with B C GLORY DAYS, who broke outwards, chased just off the inside down the backstretch, tipped three wide
into the turn, got forced to steady off the heels of a rival when impeded by BOURBON'S HOPE three furlongs from home, came under coaxing soon after,
went five wide into upper stretch and weakened. AVA K'S BOY bobbled at the start, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went
seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. MISBEHAVED broke a beat slow at the start, came under coaxing and dueled three then two wide with
CUMBERLAND BLUES to his inside, swung four wide into upper stretch in the midst of being shaken off and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
JUMPSTER disputed the pace between horses, was asked in the two to three path around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, battled outside
of the runner-up into the final furlong, brushed with that foe shortly thereafter, dueled gamely to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging.
WARRIOR IN CHIEF broke a step slow, moved up then was rated just off the pace, advanced through a rail opening to make a bid with a half-mile to run,
vied inside while asked on the turn, fought with the winner into the final furlong, drifted out and brushed with that foe shortly thereafter, fought on gamely to
the wire and just missed while clear for the place. ROYAL REALM was hustled from the gate then moved out early before being taken under a tight hold,
raced outside under stout restraint, was asked near the seven-sixteenths, chased five then four wide around the turn, pursued the top two under a drive in
the stretch and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. GREAT WORKOUT came away awkwardly, was rated behind horses near the back, went
three then two wide while put to urging on the turn and came up empty. KUMAR moved in while going to the front, contested the pace on the inside of two
foes, was taken up while dropping back off heels near the half-mile pole, went around the turn in the two path and had nothing left. SCOTTY was rated near
the back of the field, came under urging late on the backstretch, dropped back four wide on the turn and failed to respond. AMERICAN LINCOLN contested
the pace on the outside, dropped back under urging in the three path on the turn and retreated.

urging in the two path on the turn, regained the advantage in upper stretch, responded well under the crop in the final furlong and held sway. OUSTER

winner outside in the drive and gained late but missed while clear for the place. WHITTINGTON PARK broke a step slow, settled at the rear, saved ground
under urging on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and finished with good energy to garner the show. BALDIZAR settled on the outside, chased four then
three wide on the turn, made a bid at the quarter-pole, fought outside of two foes while remaining on his inside lead into the final furlong then swapped to the
proper lead and weakened. AWESOME NATIVE was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the inside, took a narrow advantage at the
sevens-sixteenths, was asked while inside on the turn, lost the advantage back to the winner in upper stretch and tired. HUSH OF A STORM settled off the
pace, was urged three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. THE COBBLER pressed the pace on the outside, came

Footnotes
COLLOQUY got bumped and pinched between foes at the start getting away last, chased just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at
the seven-sixteenths and advanced just off the inside through the turn into contention when spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, seized command
straightened away and dug in under a drive inching away to the eighth pole, held sway kept to task to the finish. MANDATORY bobbled at the break and
then got bumped by the aforementioned foe due to pressure from BATTER UP BUD and SALUTE TO AMERICA, dueled from the two path with SALUTE
TO AMERICA to his inside, shook off that rival midway on the turn and got confronted by a flanking pair through the latter portion of the turn, swung four
wide into upper stretch and yielded command straightened away, dug in under a drive fighting on to the finish to secure the place honors. NORGAY three
wide in pursuit from just off the duel, advanced under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths into contention midway on the turn, bid for command nearing the
quarter pole and went five wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages while safe for the show honors. ACHILLES HEEL chased along the
inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. BATTER UP BUD broke out at the
start bumping COLLOQUY in tandem with SALUTE TO AMERICA, then got brushed by that veering out rival and pinched back COLLOQUY from the
pressure while getting placed briefly in tight himself, chased along the inside coming under prolonged coaxing at the nine-sixteenths, went five wide into
upper stretch and made no impact. SALUTE TO AMERICA veered out at the start brushing BATTER UP BUD and nudging that rival into COLLOQUY
against pressure outside from MANDATORY, ranged up after the start to duel inside of MANDATORY, knocked heads until shaken off when placed to
coaxing three furlongs from home, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
Following a shoe repair in the paddock, CAIRO SUGAR got away last and was coaxed from the gate to quickly advance seizing the front soon after the
start, showed the way in hand just off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the inside nearing the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths
as the field stacked up across the track to the outside and behind, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive to hold sway
determined to prevail at the finish. LES BON TEMPS brushed the off side stall at the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then
three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive chasing the winner home
while ultimately rebuffed to the end. SWEETEST PRINCESS three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive and kept on to procure the show honors on the wire. I'MHAVINGAMOMENT six paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing half a mile from home, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild late bid
which proved no enough to impact the top trio. LUNA LOCA four paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. STARRY MIDNIGHT brushed
the off side stall at the start, raced seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn, went six wide into upper stretch and
trailed.

Footnotes
RUN DEVIL moved in while going to the front, showed the way under pressure from her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was headed by the
runner-up late on that bend, battled with that foe while tight against the rail in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong then switched out, came
again with renewed energy while outside into the final sixteenth and got up to narrowly prevail. TIMED OUT moved up after breaking at the rear, pressed the
pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, gained the lead late on that bend, dropped to the two path in upper stretch, inched clear inside
the furlong marker, led to the final strides but was denied while clear for the place. WICCA WISDOM settled off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path
around the turn, spun three wide into the stretch then angled further out and narrowly earned the show while no match for the top two. NEW YORK
SUPREME broke out and tossed her head some at the start but came out with the field, tracked the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the four path
on the turn, chased into upper stretch and weakened then just missed the show. APRIL ANTICS settled off the pace, moved from the two path to the four
path while getting out slightly on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. BRAVO REGINA settled on the outside, was carried from the
three path to the five path around the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SUPER DUPER FLY brushed with a rival at the start then
