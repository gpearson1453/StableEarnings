Footnotes
BARB'S PRIDE pressured the pace inside and took the lead at the rail midway on the turn, raced clear leaving the eighth pole and held well with steady
handling. IRISH VALENTINE chased the early pace outside, closed to a brief lead three wide nearing the quarter pole, was met while two deep midway on
the turn then dueled through the stretch for second. BABY BULLDOG chased through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn then outfinished in the
stretch duel for second. MIMS SECOND CHANCE chased the leaders through the backstretch, raced two deep on the turn, angled to the outside leaving
the turn then lugged in while finishing evenly. CALERA LOVE ducked in leaving the gate then took the lead and set a pressured pace, was met between
horses approaching the quarter pole but weakened while losing ground approaching the head of the lane. BAL ROBINSON raced well back from early
contention and could only close the gap.

Footnotes
GOLDEN SWEETS raced with the early pace two deep then took the lead approaching the half mile pole, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths,
rounded the far turn near the rail and dug in under steady handling in the lane. KATALIMA settled off the rail on the first turn, eased out with a bid into the
backstretch and raced in the three path of the far turn, then dueled through the stretch for second. MISS CHAMITA settled well off the pace inside, picked
up the chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and came along for third later yards while gaining on the runner-up.
DIAMONDS N DENIM set the early pace inside, was met and gave chase approaching the half mile pole, but dropped back at the rail toward the quarter,
drifted leaving the turn and flattened stride. CODAS HONOR saved early ground racing well back, picked up the chase toward the nine sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn about the four path and passed some rivals in the lane. VICTORY ROYALE saved ground, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened. SKYFLY rounded the opening turn in the four path, gave chase leaving the half mile pole then flattened
off the rail on the far turn. CAPTIVATING GAL became a bit anxious in the gate and rounded the first turn off the rail, gave chase past the half mile pole but
faded in the four path of the far turn.

CASTLE LIGHTS took a quick lead and set the pace while tapering in, came under pressure at the quarter pole, widened at the rail on the turn and was
steadily handled in the lane. LUNAR PRAYER chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn then eased out into the lane and dug in to hold second.
CEDAR'S WISH became a bit edgy in the gate, gave chase outside through the backstretch, was carried to the seven path nearing the head of the lane and
came along for third later yards while gaining on the runner-up. THELADYISTRUE chased the leaders through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the
rail and ran evenly down the lane. GRANDIOSELY broke a step slow, chased inside then angled to the six path toward the head of the lane and weakened
in the drive. WITNESS THE ENERGY was shuffled back on the chute and saved ground. JUBA'S HOUSE gave chase and raced off the rail on the turn. ALL
WORKED UP chased through the backstretch, weakened in the four path of the turn, bore out leaving the turn and was eased in the lane.

CONGRESS HALL settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole and improved at the rail on the far turn, took over leaving the
eighth pole and dug in under steady handling to hold on. MISS MORENO raced well off the pace inside on the first turn, started a bid approaching the seven
sixteenths pole and improved in the three and four paths of the far turn, dueled to a clear second in late yards and was gaining on the winner.
ONEPRETTYTHING stalked off the rail leaving the first turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn,
was forced to the seven path leaving the turn but dug in and finished well to take third in the final yards. SHE FIGURES saved early ground well off the pace
then eased out into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the seven path and finished well; widest.
STYLISH PAINT settled close to the early pace about the three path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced in range at the rail on the far turn,
continued close through the upper stretch then flattened the final sixteenth. LIFE IN FLASH raced well back inside on the first turn, gave chase leaving the
three eighths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, ran evenly to mid-stretch but flattened the final sixteenth. SHACKABOOM tapered in to take the lead
approaching the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the
far turn but bore out under left hand urging leaving the turn, and weakened in the lane. SHINY PENNY rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the five path of the far turn. SEEDS OF TIME raced well off the pace in the three path the first turn, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened widest on the far turn. ONLY REWARD'S saved ground and was through after a half mile.
