Footnotes
NAME THE PRICE showed good early speed to set the early pace and held gamely to be clear under strong pressure. WANT TO BE COWBOY chased the
early leader from the outside and finished second best. TELLITTOTHEJUDGE raced off the early pace, was four wide into the upper stretch and slowly
closed in on the top pair. CHARED was hustled along, raced near the rail and had not enough. MISS ADDISYN K chased the early pace, raced four wide
near the eighth pole and weakened. REPORT TO DUTY raced four to five wide and never was a factor. PICKLES N ME was slow early and trailed.
