Footnotes
VANISKY tracked the early pace, raced four wide into the first turn, advanced along the backstretch run, roused three wide on the far turn, ran in pursuit of
the pacesetter to mid-stretch, confronted QUE SERA SIR RALPH nearing the furlong marker, battled with that foe to the sixteenth-pole, assumed command
and kept to task in the late stages to prevail. TAM'S TIME unhurried in the early stages, roused along the second turn, swung widest into the stretch run,
rallied five wide in the drive, closed well in deep stretch, could not reel in the winner in the final stages and was up for place. QUE SERA SIR RALPH sent
leaving the break, drifted in entering the first turn, dictated terms through moderate early fractions, set the pace to the quarter marker, drifted in under
right-handed in mid-stretch, was confronted by VANISKY nearing the furlong marker, met that bid to the sixteenth-pole but could not keep pace late and was
well clear for third. GOVERNOR ARTHUR forwardly placed in the early stages, checked repeatedly while rank and in tight along the first turn, recovered
nearing the five-eighths pole, stalked the moderate pace to the second turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker, swung four wide for the drive and did
not offer a late rally. LOVE OF THE SPORT shuffled leaving the break and was away a step slowly, allowed to settle, saved ground into the far turn and was
not a factor. RUNAWAY KRISTIN away in good order, close up to the pace while saving ground on the first turn, stalked the moderate pace to the second
turn, asked for run at the top of the lane, steadied off of heels when QUE SERA SIR RALPH drifted in in mid-stretch, took up and dropped back in the final
furlong. THERE WERE TWO STEWARDS INQUIRIES INTO THE RUNNING OF THIS RACE. THE FIRST CONCERNED THE RUNNING ON THE FIRST
TURN INVOLVING GOVERNOR ARTHUR. THE STEWARDS RULED UNANIMOUSLY THAT WHILE GOVERNOR ARTHUR CAME IN TIGHT ALONG
THE FIRST TURN AND CHECKED REPEATEDLY, THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH BASED ON THE INCIDENT. THE
OTHER INQUIRY CONCERNED RUNAWAY KRISTIN STEADYING IN MID-STRETCH. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT
QUE SERA SIR RALPH DRIFTED IN NEARING THE EIGHTH POLE, CAUSING RUNAWAY KRISTIN TO TAKE UP, AND IN DOING SO COST THAT
RUNNER THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING. QUE SERA SIR RALPH WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED LAST. THERE
WAS ALSO A TRAINER'S OBJECTION LODGED BY THE TRAINER OF GOVERNOR ARTHUR FOR THE INCIDENT ON THE FIRST TURN AND A
JOCKEY'S OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF RUNAWAY KRISTIN FOR THE INCIDENT IN MID-STRETCH.

QUIET CHARM broke a step slow then rushed up to easily seize the early lead, was challenged from all sides at the top of the stretch responded when
asked for more and ran on well to win by a comfortable margin. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET broke well, kept to the inside on the flank of the leader while
under a tight hold early, was in a bit tight through the turn and at the head of the stretch, swung out a path for clear run past the eighth pole but could not
make up the needed ground while clear second. BERNIE'S BIG BOY allowed the pace scenario to develop through the first quarter mile, took a four wide
path through the turn and into the stretch, ran somewhat evenly through the stretch and was never a threat but was able get up for third. THAT'S BIND
BABE stalked the pacesetter to the turn, made a bid for the lead at the top of the stretch, was unable to gain any ground late and was outfinished for third.

DON'T TELL HYDEE contested the early lead with several rivals then assumed command heading to the turn, set solid fractions while pressed to the
quarter marker, shook clear in mid-stretch, felt late pressure from A DIME FOR ME and held in a drive to prevail. A DIME FOR ME took back off of the solid
early pace, advanced two wide between runners on the turn, came in tight and waited for racing room nearing the top of the lane, tipped three wide for the
drive, closed fast inside of the furlong marker, came within aim of DON'T TELL HYDEE in deep stretch but could not get by the winner in the final strides
and was second best. GET'EM TIGER raced close up to the solid early pace, saved ground to the quarter marker, chased to mid-stretch, was outkicked in
the late stages but ran on to secure third. MAYCEE JO showed early speed and disputed the solid early pace, pressed outside of DON'T TELL HYDEE to
the quarter marker, lost ground leaving the turn and weakened in the final furlong. DANCING CRANE chased the decent early pace, advanced three wide
on the turn, could not sustain that run in the stretch and gave way.

MEMO DADDY (CHI) rated off of the decent early pace, was steered to the three path entering the backstretch run, stalked the pace to the half-mile marker,
roused three wide nearing the quarter marker, loomed in upper stretch, battled with LOVE CANDY to mid-stretch, disposed of that foe inside of the furlong
grounds, drifted out a path in deep stretch and kept to task in the final stages to prevail. SUNNY SPOT well placed in the early going, raced two wide into
the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn, swung four wide for the drive, advanced nearing the furlong marker, came within aim of MEMO DADDY
nearing the sixteenth-marker, steadied in deep stretch when the winner drifted out a path and was second best in the end. LOVE CANDY sent after a good
beginning and dictated terms in the early stages, set solid fractions while prompted to the half-mile pole, was pressed to the top of the lane, shook free of
OUR SILVER OAK in upper stretch, battled with MEMO DADDY to the furlong grounds, weakened in the final furlong and held safely in the end for third.
LOAFERS BOY bobbled at the start and was away slowly, was allowed to settle, saved ground to the far turn and lacked a late response. OUR SILVER
OAK hustled leaving the break, kept close attendance to LOVE CANDY through solid fractions to the half-mile marker, pressed to the quarter pole, lost

Footnotes
CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) allowed to settle, maintained position through the backstretch run, swung widest into the drive, closed fast while five wide in
upper stretch, quickly overtook DANCE LADY inside of the furlong marker and pulled away in the late stages as much the best. STEIN'S GIRL unhurried,
saved ground to the quarter marker, roused at the top of the lane, rallied in the drive, was no match for the winner in deep stretch but stayed on in the end to
be second best. DANCE LADY tracked the solid early pace, made a three wide middle move heading to the far turn, vied for the lead three deep nearing the
top of the lane, battled with DRESS REHEARSAL in the drive, could not hold off CAN'THELPFALLIN in mid-stretch, weakened in the late stages and was
well clear for third. DRESS REHEARSAL asked to show early speed after a good beginning and dictated terms to the first turn, set a pressured pace into
the backstretch run then ceded the lead to LAST INNING, tracked that foe to the far turn, vied for the lead from the rail nearing the quarter marker, battled
with DANCE LADY to mid-stretch and faded in the final furlong. INDIAN DANCER took back off of the solid early pace, advanced two wide on the far turn,
ran evenly to mid-stretch and faltered in the late stages. LAST INNING squeezed a bit at the start and away a step slowly, hard sent to contest the early
pace, assumed command along the backstretch run and set solid fractions to the half-mile marker, vied between runners to the quarter marker, dropped
back in upper stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
BROOKYS TAPIT stalked the decent early pace from the second flight, well positioned through the backstretch run while tracking the moderate pace, raced
two wide to the quarter marker, angled five wide in upper stretch, closed to come within aim nearing the furlong grounds, assumed command inside of the
furlong pole and kept to task under left-handed urging in the late stages. SPROSTON unhurried in the early going, not far back through the backstretch run,
bumped with BORKAN then slipped to the inside heading to the second turn, saved ground to the top of the lane, advanced in mid-stretch, could not reel in
the winner in the final stages but closed well in the end and secured second. MR BOTANICALS contested the decent early pace, took a narrow lead into the
backstretch run then extended the lead approaching the far turn, set moderate fractions to the quarter marker, set down for the drive, held foes at bay to
mid-stretch, could not keep pace with BROOKYS TAPIT inside of the furlong marker and was outfinished in deep stretch for second, while just holding in the
final strides for third. GORDY'S BOY broke out at the start and was off a step slowly, stalked the moderate fractions while outside of rivals through the
backstretch run, raced three wide into the far turn, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, came four wide into the stretch run, ran evenly to mid-stretch,
was outkicked in the final stages and just missed for third. HARBOR SKY lunged at the start then was shuffled in the first few strides and was off slowly, was
allowed to settle along the first turn, made a middle move and was well placed into the far turn, raced three wide into the drive and weakened. LYING
GHOST set the pace along the first turn, ceded the lead into the backstretch run and raced close to the pace to the far turn, saved ground to the quarter
marker, tipped two wide for the drive, came in tight in mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong. BORKAN away in good order and forwardly placed into
the first turn, was a bit keen then was taken under a snug hold into the backstretch run, dropped back nearing the half-mile marker, bumped with
SPROSTON heading to the second turn, was roused nearing the quarter marker, circled six wide into the drive, advanced nearing the furlong pole but could
not sustain that run and flattened out.

Footnotes
STATEFOREST sent leaving the break, assumed command into the first turn and set modest early fractions, was well rated through the backstretch run,
turned away HARBOR ABBEY leaving the quarter marker, held that foe at bay to mid-stretch and determinedly dug in in the final sixteenth to prevail.
HARBOR ABBEY away in good order, stalked the pacesetter through modest early fractions, advanced nearing the quarter marker to challenge
STATEFOREST for the lead, was turned away in that bid leaving the far turn, chased to mid-stretch, could not get by the determined winner in the final
sixteenth and held for place. CLASS CODE tracked the modest early pace, advanced four wide into the drive, was outfinished in deep stretch and just
missed for place, while holding in the final strides for show. MISS FLAWLESS (FR) rated off of the early pace, saved ground to the second turn, tipped two
wide for the drive, rallied in mid-stretch and was gaining in the final furlong. CHIEFTAIN'S LADY broke out at the start but recovered leaving the break and
was forwardly placed into the first turn, chased the modest fractions to the half-mile marker, raced evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late rally. REMEMBER
SUE allowed to settle, maintained position through the backstretch run while not far back, raced three wide into the stretch and did not produce a late
response. MISS EVER READY unhurried in the early stages, raced three wide into the backstretch run, trailed to the far turn, raced three wide into the
stretch drive, shifted out in mid-stretch and showed good late interest while unable to threaten in the final stages. GRIGORO took back in the early stages,
clipped heels with MISS EVER READY heading to the first turn, settled into the backstretch run, was keen nearing the half-mile marker and pulled to be
close to the pace heading to the far turn, raced outside of rivals to the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
BLUE WILDCAT content to track mid-pack down the backstretch, made a sweeping move around the turn to get into contention, was even with the leaders
as the field turned for home, dueled with PRESSKIT the length of the stretch and was able to get a nose in front of that determined rival at the wire.
PRESKITT broke in and bumped lightly with BLUE WILDCAT after the break then easily gained the early advantage but was content to cede the lead to
ICONIC SKY, chased that one to the quarter pole, angled to the inside for the stretch run and ran on well only to lose a head bob at the wire.
MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN unhurried down the backstretch, responded when asked to pick it up with three furlongs to run, swung four wide into the turn and
closed willingly to gain third. SEEMS LOGICAL not asked for speed from the break, raced the first quarter mile under a hold, nearly clipped heels with TEN
THE SMART WAY near the half mile marker then backed off, stayed to the inside and summoned a good late run up the rail in the stretch and was gaining
on the leaders late but ran out of race track. OCTANE (BRZ) lagged near the rear of the field after the break, pulled on the rider passing the half mile pole,
was still last through the turn, stayed inside for the stretch run and finish with a grinding late run to be part of the crowed photo finish. LADY'S SERMON
lacked early speed despite being asked after the break, came under a hard ride from the seven-sixteenths pole, went four-wide through the turn and swung
out into the five path for the stretch run, finished with some interest while still wide and was gaining at the finish. ICONIC SKY broke slowly then rushed up
to seize the early lead, held an open lead to the quarter pole then wilted when challenged at the top of the stretch. TEN THE SMART WAY came away well
from the outside, was content to track the pace from mid-pack while about four wide, moved forward through the turn in tandem with BLUE WILDCAT inside,
then began to struggle passing the three-sixteenths pole and was no factor from that point.
