Footnotes
MISS KALINE bumped with ONLY LIGHTNING at the start, set the pace from inside under pressure then cleared outer rivals on the backstretch, drifted out
a bit at the quarter. PRESTIGIOUS trailed two wide early, moved into range then went inside a pair of rivals leaving the backstretch, saved ground around
the second turn then entered the lane two wide, was no match for the winner in the furlong grounds but churned on to best the rest. JACQUELINE
COCHRAN raced up close three deep early, chased outside a rival then three deep into the far turn, continued in the three path into the drive and flattened
in the late stages. MAGIC CAPITAL stumbled leaving the gate, forwardly placed four deep into the first turn, trailed four wide into the far turn, moved out to
the five path and remained wide into the lane and lacked a rally. ONLY LIGHTNING bumped leaving the gate, pressed between rivals early, chased the
leader up the backstretch, started to weaken between foes on the far turn and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
HORN OF PLENTY pressed the pace from inside then moved up on even terms with MONGOLIAN FORD, took over into the turn, put away MONGOLIAN
FORD past the five-sixteenths pole, fought with ESTABLISHED into the lane, moved clear outside the eighth pole and inched away in late. ESTABLISHED
broke a step slow, stalked the duo up the backstretch, bid three deep around the bend, lost touch with the leader in upper stretch and chased the winner to
the wire while clearly second best. ITALIANO chased outside a rival early, went three wide into the bend, took aim four wide into the stretch and weakened.
BOX OF CHOCOLATES chased along the rail to the stretch and weakened. MONGOLIAN FORD set the pace outside HORN OF PLENTY then dueled up
the backstretch, lost command into the turn, kept the pressure on to the five-sixteenths pole, could not go on with the winner approaching the quarter pole
and faded in the lane.

TEENA ELLA away quickly, steadied and threw her head after crossing back onto the turn, ceded command from between rivals, moved to the inside
stalking the top pair, tipped two wide into the stretch, moved out in the lane and drove clear. IRISH ROSE dropped back early, trailed on the inside into the
turn, advanced along the fence through the bend, lacked room behind a rival and altered out in upper stretch, then rallied to gain the place. MAKE IT SNOW
sat off the pace, went two wide into the turn, angled out and came four wide into the stretch, closed well through the lane and missed second. FOOLISH
prompted the pace from outside early on, raced on even terms midway around the bend, took over leaving the turn, cleared briefly in upper stretch but was
soon challenged from outside, relinquished the lead in midstretch and flattened in the final sixteenth. IRISH PATSY got bothered from outside and steadied
briefly early, went two wide around the turn, three wide into the stretch, lugged in near the eighth pole and could not rally. WUDI set the pace under pressure
from outside rival, dueled around the turn, lost command approaching the stretch and weakened. CRIMSON SONATA stalked the top pair off the rail into
the turn, spun three wide into the lane and weakened. CARSON JEN threw her head and hopped slightly at the start but still came away with the field,
reserved in the early stages near the inside then two wide on the turn, raced between leaving the bend and weakened under minimal asking. DISRUPTIVE
ARTIST was off slow from outside, raced three wide into the turn, trailed two wide into the stretch and was not a factor.

around the bend, chased three then two wide on the second bend, steadied behind YELLOW BRICK in upper stretch, moved out and edged that rival for
second. YELLOW BRICK showed early speed from inside then chased the leader around the first turn, moved off the rail then went between to challenge for
command, vied up the backstretch, held a short lead into the far turn, moved clear past the five-sixteenths pole, challenged by the winner at the top of the
lane, could not offer any resistance and got edged for the place honors. I DON'T GET IT stumbled badly at the start, raced on the inside off the pace, went
between rivals at the three-eighths pole, spun three wide into the lane, moved out further in the drive and kept on for a minor award. RIVERSIDE stalked on
the inside into the first turn, moved out and went three wide into the backstretch, vied three deep in the middle stages, kept the pressure on to the
five-sixteenths pole then lost contact and chased along the rail into the lane and weakened. HORNUNG was off slow to begin and never got invovled.

SPOILED ROTTEN vied for command between rivals, dueled outside SUGAR SUGAR past the five-sixteenths pole, put that rival away past the sixteenth
pole and gamely prevailed over the late challenge from the runner-up. SAPADILLA stalked the speedy trio outside a rival, spun three wide into the lane,
rallied and drew alongside SPOILED ROTTEN in the final sixteenth but could not get by. SUGAR SUGAR vied inside a pair of rivals to the turn, dueled past
the five-sixteenths pole, battled through the lane and flattened in the final sixteenth. VEGAS DREAM was antsy in the gate, vied for the lead three deep
early, could not keep pace past the five-sixteenths marker, chased two wide into the drive and weakened. MACHO QUEEN bumped with inner rival at the
start, checked off heels early, saved ground then tipped out at the top of the lane and improved position. LADY DERBY antsy in the starting gate, checked
between rivals nearing the half-mile pole, went three then four wide on the turn and came up empty in the drive. CAT BANDIT climbed early behind the field,
went two to three wide on the turn and failed to menace. MENSA ON TAP bumped in the beginning, stalked the top trio on the inside and faded in the lane.
AMAGE coaxed from the gate early, chased outside rivals and got bothered from inside approaching the half-mile pole, rounded the bend four then five wide
and weakened.

Footnotes
AG BULLET brushed the gate but was still away in good order, showed early speed then was taken in hand and rated behind the leader from inside, bid two
wide at the five-sixteenths pole, took over then cleared in upper stretch and held gamely in the closing moments. THE WILD GRAZER (IRE) tracked in the
two path, went three deep into the far turn, bumped with TEA N CONVERSTATION entering the stretch, chased into the final sixteenth, then launched a late
bid but ran out of time. PRINCESS BETTINA bumped into the first turn while in the two path, settled off the pace, went between runners in middle stages,
had to pause when boxed in three deep entering the far turn, tipped out into the clear and was roused four wide around the bend, rallied from outside in the
lane and gained the show. TEA N CONVERSATION unhurried in the early going and moved inside, bumped with outer rival into the first turn, went between
rivals at the half-mile pole, brushed with NYVAN at the five-sixteenths pole, bumped with outer rival into the stretch, then finished willingly in the final furlong
for a minor award. NYVAN pulled along the inside early then settled in range, brushed with TEA N CONVERSATION at the five-sixteenths pole, stayed
inside to the stretch and could not rally. BROADWAY GIRLS sped clear and crossed over to the inside, showed the way up the backstretch, pressured from
outside at the five-sixteenths marker, dueled into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. QUICKLY PARK IT traveled
three deep early at the back, went four deep into the far turn, dropped back to last and angled down to the two path, eased in the lane and walked off.
