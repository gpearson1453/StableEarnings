rallied on the far turn, drew even in mid stretch, was outfinished late but was clearly second best. UNBRIDLED CAUSE tracked three wide and went evenly
late. TEQUILA FLATS had good position on the inside and had no late rally. ROLLIN SO PERFECT allowed to settle, failed to menace. WHISKEY HELPS
was outrun.
