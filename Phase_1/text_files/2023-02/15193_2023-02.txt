Footnotes
LANTERN'S CANDY outrun for five furlongs just off the inside, dropped to the rail early in the far turn, patiently handled behind horses while continuing to
save ground late in the bend, challenged along the rail nearing the furlong marker, vied to the wire, proved narrowly best in a determined effort. LANDSLID
chased the leader while off the inside, advanced and challenged that one midway on the final turn in the two path, continued to vie as the winner lodged a
challenge along the rail approaching midstretch, dueled with that one late, outkicked in the late going to miss. NAVAGATIONALBEACON broke on top,
cleared to the inside, continued to show the way up the backstretch by daylight, responded when confronted by the runner up second turn, dueled with that
one through upper stretch, was appearing to weaken when steadied between the top two late, continued to give way, saved the show. LADY ENVOY settled
off the pace outside, three wide through the first turn, again through the second bend, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing bid. ABBY THE
BULL DAWG void of speed, lodged a four wide middle move through the second turn to reach a striking position, failed to sustain that advance through the
lane. ELI'S GIRL lacked speed while racing toward the inside, failed to rally when called on for the drive. DIAL DISH in the second flight along the inside,
stopped into the far turn.

Footnotes
MEGAN'S CLARA forwardly placed from the start, lodged a three wide bid through the turn, took command into the lane, drew well off under a hand ride to
win with something left. BIG JAVA last to leave after being bothered slightly by PROUD FOOT, raced four wide when with the second flight into the turn,
three wide exiting the bend, rallied for the second spot while no threat to the winner. PROUD FOOT broke out, behind the pace toward the inside, crept a bit
closer behind traffic late in the turn, brief wait, showed some mild late interest to be up late for the show. YOLANDA WHO moved up to set the pace, clear
before a quarter, offered little resistance to the winner when confronted by that one in the turn, weakened when headed, nipped late for the show. BIZZY
GAL broke alertly, chased the leader early while along the inside, began to fade before a half. FUNTIMEGIRL tired while racing outside.

Footnotes
WATCH THIS MUNNY broke on top, clear into the first turn, rated when still clear up the backstretch and into the far turn, steadily increased advantage
through the lane to win ridden out. PERFECTLY GOLDEN broke in and a step slow, settled off the pace toward the inside, came in the two path for the
drive, proved no match for the winner through the stretch, clearly second best. REAUX BINA void of speed, four wide through the second turn when making
a mild advance, finished up best of the others. LOVELY JOYCE hesitated at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, trailed, three wide second turn
when advancing, flattened out through the lane. TRIBAL SPIRIT off the pace while three wide early, dropped inside late in the second bend, went evenly
through the lane in lacking a closing response. ROCKABILLIE in the second flight while racing three wide, chased the winner the middle half mile and
weakened. BICARB BETTY forwardly placed early, began to back up after a half, far back, jogged in. SAENGER STAR finished after a half, stopped and
also lost contact with the field to jog in.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA STREET off the early pace toward the inside, bit closer while in some traffic late in the turn, patiently handling into the lane, steered out and
split foes when the opportunity presented itself nearing the furlong marker under clever handling, bid, kicked clear, held late. DRIFTER lacked early foot well
out in the strip, three wide into the turn, four to five wide exiting when beginning to advance, remained widest to the wire, getting to the winner late. NEWS
BOX in mid pack early while toward the inside, worked way to to the three path in some traffic late in the turn, staged a mild rally when clear for the drive to
pick up the show. TILLIS vied up front while between horses, continued to battle into the lane, faltered late when headed by the winner with less than a
furlong remaining. WHOOPING JAY away in good order, helped set the pace for a half along the inside, fell back into the stretch, moved out, finished up
evenly. WESLEYAN away well from the outside, contested the pace while four wide into the turn, remained on the outside, second bend, held a narrow
advantage with a furlong remaining and faltered. OPTIMUS KAT off a step slow, remained far back for a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the
issue had been decided. EISENSTAEDT off slowly, moved up to race in mid pack early, four wide into the lane, faded. ATRAS in the second flight, stopped
after a half.

PRINCEDREAMCESS with the pace from the start in the three path, dueled into and through the turn, disposed of the other speed into the lane, kicked well
clear. JETS A GINNIN dueled up front inside the winner, proved no match for that one through the lane, remained clear for the place. A REAL JEWEL in the
second flight up the backstretch, one off the rail and in the second flight, came three wide for the drive, getting to the runner up late. SHEZZ KOLDAZICE
back off the pace outside, four wide turn, lacked a closing kick. LA MORENA off a step slow, four wide into the stretch, picked off a couple of faltering foes
while not a threat. SO IT WOULD SEEM within striking distance along the inside, backed up through the stretch. TIPSY GAL tired while racing three wide.

Footnotes
YOU VEE CEE off slowly, fell further back be sluggish early, angled four wide turning for home, steered out a bit more to be widest, finished with good
energy down the middle of the strip to be in time. PEACEFUL STREET broke alertly, set the pace in the two path, shook off a couple of mild challenges past
the furlong marker, to be clear again, nailed in the final strides. LOST IN LIMBO behind the pace in the two path, steered out into the four path late in the
turn and into the stretch, rallied for the show while between the top two at the wire. COSMO within striking distance in the second flight and between foes,
fell back through the turn, improved a bit down the lane with some mild interest. BLAME J D forwardly placed up the backstretch outside, four wide into the
turn, closer with a three wide challenge late in the bend, faltered in the final furlong. DOUBLY BLESSED underwent a shoe repair in the paddock. off a step
slow, steered out to five wide turning for home, made a mild advance through upper stretch then flattened out. UPSTRIKER chased the leader early, tried
that one between foes out of the turn and gave way. LOOKIN FOR LOKI forwardly placed early, began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
MAHOMEY outrun in the early going, advanced two path turn, came three wide for the drive, challenged in tight between rivals nearing the furlong marker,
dueled to the wire, proved best in a game effort. LOCHMOOR also lacked early foot, angled out in traffic four wide turning for home, challenged outside the
winner in midstretch, outdueled to the wire. KING PEANUT forwardly placed off the three wide, came four wide when floated out a bit in some traffic entering
the stretch, remained prominent past the furlong grounds, lacked a winning punch, clear of the others. AFLEET SKY in the second flight outside, four to five
wide through the turn, also lacked the necessary closing response. MO CHOCTAW broke sharp, soon sprinted clear, continued to hold a daylight advantage
through the turn, faltered when headed when straightened for home in upper stretch. STREET COMMANDER off a step slow, void of any early speed
toward the inside, improved position without posing a serious threat. ALLO ENRY went one paced in saving ground to no avail. TOPF ROAD RULES in mid
pack early while well wide, five wide into the turn, fanned seven wide leaving, lacked a rally to finish up evenly. WESTHEIMER STREET chased the leader
for a half in the two path, gave way in the drive. HAMAZING WISDOM broke back, failed to menace with a three wide trip. REUP hesitated at the break and
was never involved. GOODNIGHT ARCHIE in the second flight outside, fanned six wide out of the turn, backed up through the lane.

Footnotes
CAMPISI stalked the leader from the four path into the turn, advanced on that one while angling in slightly to be three wide late in the bend, bid, quickly
clear, enough left to hold off the late charge from the runner up. SUNSIGN fell back to trail well back after the start, four wide through the turn, steered out
wider for the drive and closed with a flourish to be getting to the winner late. ORDER OF MERIT back off the pace and the inside, three to four wide when
beginning to advance out of the turn, rallied to be closest to the winner past the furlong marker, caught late for the place. SINGING GROOM off a step slow,
well back up the backstretch, raced in the two path through the turn, improved inside of rivals, no threat to the top three. FALCONITE broke alertly, soon
clear, continued to hold daylight through the turn, offered but brief resistance to the winner when that one challenged into the lane, caved when headed by
that same rival. SANTINO'S FANTASY went one paced while in the two path. UNCAPTURED DREAM away in good order, prompted the leader from the
three path for almost four furlongs and began to give way. LEOLA tired while racing four wide through the turn. GUARDED off a step slow, used a bit to
move up into a forward position in the second flight, stopped trough the lane.
