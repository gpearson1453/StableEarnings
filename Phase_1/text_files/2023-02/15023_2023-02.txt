Footnotes
WHENUDON'T KNOW Broke sharply, quickly and effortlessly made way to lead by crossing over to the two path, was never challenged from that point and
always looked a winner. MR BUG Z Chased blitzing leader well off the rail, second best. CLASSIC CALIFORNIA Cut across inside three rivals fifty yards out
of the gate and impeded BELLA VINO greatly, moved up slightly between rivals in the move up of the backstretch, swung wide for the stretch, gained late.
WEST COAST ANDY Moved up shortly after the break to challenge for second with inside rival, chased in the four path, faded late. IGO Tracked off the
pace throughout, never did enough to advance. FACE OF GRACE Broke inwards greatly, taken back after the awkward start and settled well off the pace,
never had run. BELLA VINO Away a touch slow, taken out by outside rival cutting across as they passed the backstretch gap and was unable to threaten
from that point. DYNAMIC WOMAN Pinched at the start by outside rival and inside rival holding lane, trailed throughout following rough break, never a
factor. A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND RIDERS OBJECTION WAS LODGED INTO THE START OF THE RACE. IT WAS DETERMINED #4 CLASSIC
CALIFORNIA IMPEDED #1 BELLA VINO TO A LEVEL THAT WOULD AFFECT HER BEST PLACING. #4 CLASSIC CALIFORNIA WAS DISQUALIFIED
FROM FOURTH TO SEVENTH PLACE.

Footnotes
A GEM IS A GEM Vied along rail from the break with outside foe, moved to a narrow lead at the seven-sixteenths pole and controlled all the way home to
victory. ROYAL TAP Vied outside rival throughout, was a clear second into the far turn but still in place to threaten, battled while chasing nagging inner foe,
never found enough to win. FIRST COUNT Stalked three wide from the break while well in touch of leaders, never improved throughout, never weakened
throughout. BREXTON Taken back last immediately following the start, sat steady until commencing a three wide bid at the five-sixteenths pole, while the
mild move was apparent it was stymied by a commanding top duo throughout. ROLL OUT Settled in back half along the two path opening stages, began
move at the three-eighths pole in the two path, showed a very unimpressionable and slim gain down the stretch. ZENMAGIC Tracked off the early foot on
the rail, called upon at the five-sixteenths pole, showed no response, was taken care of to the wire.

Footnotes
BIG CITY BANE Inside of foes well off flying leader opening stages, began to advance along the rail starting at the three-eights pole and steadily improved
making his way into the stretch, surged down the lane and got up in dying frames. TIGER BY HIS TAIL Blitzed to the lead and opened up a healthy
advantage on the competition, showed signs of weariness at the three-sixteenths pole and drifted a few paths making way into stretch at the eighth pole,
fought while tiring yet still nipped at the wire. ROCKED Tracked in the second flight inside of rival, moved at the five-sixteenths pole along the three path,
rallied on the wrong lead down the center of the stretch, not enough. NORTHERN QUEST Trailed inside, showed mild improve past tiring foes, never a
menace. LINEMANS CHECK Sat well off the pace in the middle of the pack striding along in the fourth lane, asked at multiple stages but yielded no
response. AUTISM SAVANT Traveled well off the rail and well off the pace throughout, maintained wide path of travel throughout, never a threat.
KATZUMOTO Tracked in the second flight along the rail and inside a foe, after showing brief speed faded throughout.

Footnotes
ALEX'S GIRL Broke very alertly and fired to lead comfortably, maintained strong motion up backstretch on top, commanded into the lane, held lone
challenger at bay in final sixteenth. HUGHIE'S HOLIDAY Stalked in three path early on, commenced three wide bid on the far turn, pursued leader into the
lane but was unable to run her down. PRINCESS SUGEITH Pressed along the two path, asked at the three-sixteenths pole to threaten, faded down stretch.
KIND BUT SHE LIES Stumbled to knees at start, asked to keep pace and eventually showed gain along the backside in the four path, flattened out when
the running got going. PREDETERMINATION Was far back throughout and passed one tiring foe. MEXICAN DREAM Tucked in pocket along rail just
behind the leader, advanced a few lengths into the first turn, asked throughout to stay engaged, ultimately gave in at the quarter pole and was eased home.
