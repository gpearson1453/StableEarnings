Footnotes
ELECTRIC SENSE set a clear pace in the two path around the turn, drew further away under driving pressure in upper stretch, but tired in the final
sixteenth, yet lasted safely. SHE'S JERSEY TUFF tracked along the inside, retreated at the three furlong pole to shift off of the rail, trailed two wide and
between horses at the five sixteenths pole, then shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, and stayed on to claim place at the sixteenth pole. MYSTIC
STORM stalked three wide, gained place in pursuit of the clear leader around the turn, failed to keep pace with that one in the four path in upper stretch,
then lost place to an outer rival at the sixteenth pole. TATTERED HEART chased two wide and between horses, cleared an inner rival at the three furlong
pole, then faded along the inside through the lane. DESSERT FIRST trailed in the four path, got floated to the six path in upper stretch, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
WHAT CAN I SAY tracked along the inside, took aim outside of the clear leader in upper stretch, then drove past that foe at the sixteenth pole. COUNTRY
LADY was restless in the gates while awaiting the start, then broke a step slow, brushed with rivals on both sides before emerging between them while
advancing early on, reached the front at the nine sixteenths pole, cleared into the turn, maintained a clear margin through midstretch from a chasing foe
while hanging on her left lead, but was caught with a sixteenth to go. CCED FOR STEPH trailed along the inside, rallied to claim show in upper stretch
before shifting out leaving the furlong grounds, but leveled off soon after. HEY MADALYN CLAIRE pressed two wide early on, chased the clear leader from
between horses around the bend, then yielded three wide in upper stretch while hanging on her left lead. WHERE'S THE PUMPS pursued from midpack
two wide and between horses, failed to sustain that position despite heavy urging into the turn, shifted from the three path to the five path turning for home,
but drifted to the seven path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. COPPER MOON got floated outwardly by an inner foe at the start, lacked speed in the four
path, and got outrun. DOLLY'S GUITAR broke outwardly, stalked three wide, but weakened on his left lead after being floated four wide entering the lane.

Footnotes
BOULDERING settled off of the pace in the four to three paths around the first turn, gained in the two path leaving the three furlong pole, swung to the four
path turning for home, and sustained his charge to drive past the tiring leader at the sixteenth pole. DUDE DROP KID trailed, gained four wide while
following BOULDERING's advance around the far turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane, and stayed on willingly while hanging on his left lead to
claim place in the final sixteenth. CIGAR VAN set the pace in the two path, vied with an inner bidder approaching the far turn, came under a drive into that
bend to clear off with five sixteenths to go, but tired approaching midstretch as an outer rival closed in, and got overhauled at the sixteenth pole while
weakening. CHROMPTON stalked along the inside, tugged forward to vie inside of the leader at the half mile pole, but failed to keep pace around the far
turn, and gave way. CHIEF KIMOSABI tracked three wide, but weakened around the far turn. OLDER AND WISER stalked outside of the pace setter,
chased the top pair into the far turn, then weakened entering the lane, and hung on his left lead. OLE STUD MUFFIN lacked speed along the inside, chased
into the far turn, and faded.

Footnotes
GLUCKSTADT stalked outside of the pace setter and from the four to three paths around the first turn, comfortably pursued the top pair around the far turn,
sustained a grinding charge to bid for the lead in the final furlong, and edged ahead late. LA BOUCANE set the pace in the three to two paths around the
first turn, felt pressure from an inner bidder into the far turn, shook free while shrugging off that rival at the furlong grounds, but met a challenge from an
outer rival soon after, and was worn down late. GEM COLLECTION raced forwardly two wide and between horses, decisively moved forward to press inside
of the leader at the half mile pole, sustained pressure around the far turn, but lacked a bid through tight rail quarters in upper stretch, yielded to his outer
counterpart at the furlong grounds, and toiled while flopping to and from his left lead in the late stages. OWEN THE ICE MAN raced at the rear along the
inside, improved in the two path around the far turn, and failed to threaten the top trio. G'S LAW lacked speed in the six to four paths around the first turn,
advanced in the three path around the far turn, and failed to menace. SIMPLY WOW tracked in the five to four paths while under light coaxing nearing the
backstretch, but failed to keep pace with the top flight at the five furlong pole, and weakened in the five path around the far turn. HINDOSTAIN FALLS
stalked along the inside, but wilted entering the far turn, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
CLEAR AS A BELE broke slowly, tucked while far back, unleashed a snappy rail blitz inside of rivals down the backstretch, scooted inside of CREEKSIDE
at the half mile pole while avoiding the inner railing, sustained his advance to bid inside of the leaders at the five sixteenths pole, then kicked clear leaving
the quarter pole, and lasted safely in the late stages. MACHO BEANIE stalked in the five to four paths into the turn, but was outmoved by a rail rallying rival
at the three furlong pole, ran on to gain place at the sixteenth pole, and was gaining on the clear leader late. PESO PESADO laid off of the pace in the three
to four paths, angled outwardly in upper stretch, and stayed on to reach show late. CUSTOM CADILLAC prompted outside of the top pair and from the four
path, but proved no match for a rail bidder turning for home, chased that foe while hanging on his left lead into the final furlong, and faltered lat.
CALIBRACHOA KID vied for the lead in the three path while between a pair of rivals into the turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. BOSTON BLITZ
trailed in the two path, came into the lane in the five path, and moved up in the seven path in the final sixteenth. RIGHTEOUS FREEDOM set the pace
inside of a pair of vying foes while a bit off of the inner rail, which allowed for the eventual winner to slip through turning for home, proved no match for that
one nearing the lane and weakened in upper stretch. OURPERFECTPRINCE broke slowly, raced far back in the four to three paths, and failed to change
leads before lugging inwardly at the furlong grounds. CREEKSIDE lacked speed in the two path, and never got involved. SPIRIT OF DREAMS pursued from
midpack in the six to five paths, and gave way entering the lane.

Footnotes
SILVER GALAXY settled off of the pace along the inside, moved out three wide at the five furlong pole, smoothly gained between horses approaching the
far turn, produced a bid entering the bend, vied turning for home, sparred with COFFEE COUNTY through the final furlong, and prevailed. COFFEE
COUNTY bumped an outer rival at the start, stalked two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, split the leaders to bid in upper stretch, dueled
with an outer rival through the final furlong, but missed. UNANIMOUSLY trailed along the inside, awaited racing room behind traffic in the three path around
the far turn, altered course to the six path in upper stretch, and rallied with a good turn of foot, but did so belatedly. WISE ANCHOR vied two wide, led
entering the backstretch, cleared to the rail soon after, showed the way from a pair of outer bidders into the far turn, sustained a duel through midstretch, but
yielded entering the final sixteenth. MAGA MAN took a nudge from an inner rival soon after the start, laid off of the pace in the three to four paths, and
chased evenly through the lane. DEER CROSSING tracked from midpack in the two path, got floated four wide down the backstretch by an inner foe,
chased from the six path around the far turn, and gave way. EVERLOVINGHAND stalked forwardly in the four path, moved forward to press two wide and
between horses into the far turn, but weakened leaving the five sixteenths pole. REAL CITY SPEED took a bump from an inner rival soon after the start,
showed the way along the inside into the first turn, allowed an outer rival to go on entering the backstretch, chased that foe into the far turn, and weakened
with three furlongs to go.

Footnotes
TWO DOT bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked along the inside, split the leaders two wide to bid at the furlong grounds, and kicked clear. TAPPIN
FORA DANCE tracked along the inside, chased from the three to four paths in midstretch, and grinded away between horses to claim place late.
DREWZANO bumped an inner rival at the start, cleared off, felt pressure from an outer rival around the turn, held sway from that foe through upper stretch,
but was outkicked by another bidder at the furlong grounds, and faltered late. ALL THE DIAMONDS broke outwardly, stalked two wide, pressed in the three
path around the turn, vied entering the lane, but yielded to an inner pair at the furlong grounds. UNDERDOG tracked in the three path, pursued in the five
path in midstretch, and chased mildly. FIFTEEN LOVE BACK lacked speed in the three to four paths, came into the lane in the six path, and failed to
menace. MAINTAINANCE MATT raced far back in the two path, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, but lacked a rally on his left lead.
OVERTHOUGHT raced far back in the three path, and got outrun. DEUTERONOMYSTRONG trailed in the four path and never got involved. JUST BLAZE
pursued from midpack along the inside, and weakened.
