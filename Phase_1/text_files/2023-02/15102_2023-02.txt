in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and improved position in the stretch. IT'S FATE led the way on the inside around the first turn and up
the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the far turn, could not go with the winner in the stretch and kept on to the wire. CHUCKY raced in the two
path around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the three path and showed no kick. EXCHEQUER
saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, navigated the far turn from the two path and failed to fire. I AM
THAT I AM raced in the two path early, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, continued around the second turn
still in the two path and faded from there. PRIVATE LAKE raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch,

Footnotes
STRINGS trailed the field up the backstretch, began to move up while racing around the turn, launched a five wide bid passing the quarter pole and kicked
clear in the lane. HEAVY WEIGHT dueled on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle from the three path around the bend and
chased the winner home in the stretch. NOT A DANCE pressed the pace between horses early, raced in the three path around the bend and improved
position mildly late. CALLE DE BOYD dueled between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the far turn and kept on to
the finish. WARP SPEED BEAST bumped mildly with the horse to his outside at the start, recovered to duel from the rail up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. DORSODURO pressed the pace on the inside through the opening stages, saved ground around the turn
and faded in the lane. ANDY WALKS WITH ME bumped multiple times with the horses to both sides at the break, settled off the pace on the inside for the
run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and made no bid. MARSICO bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced off
the pace up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn and flattened out in the lane.

Footnotes
MISS NEW YORK bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to track the leaders up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path
nearing the quarter pole, kicked clear in the final furlong and was geared down at the wire. FROSHADO veered out sharply leaving the gate, raced in the
middle of the pack on the outside early, moved up to duel from the three path around the bend and chased the winner home. HEAVENS EXPRESS bumped
mildly with the horse to her inside at the break, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and improved
position in the lane. DAMASO stalked the pace setter on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, challenged while saving ground around the bend
and weakened in the lane. R TOOTSIE GLITTER chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and faded in
the stretch. SUSIE'S SAVER raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, continued around the turn in the four path and made no bid. PACHANGA
LOCA veered in leaving the gate, recovered to lead the way up the backstretch, gave way while saving ground around the turn and continued to tire from
there.

HAPPY CAJUN dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path around the turn and dug in gamely in the stretch to hold
the win. STRAIGHT SHOT bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, began a
bid from the four path coming around the bend and dueled down the stretch but could not get by the winner. BLAKENSTEIN raced off the pace on the
outside early, began a bid form the five path coming around the turn and chased the top two home in the lane. SCRUTINIZER bumped with the horse to his
outside at the break, raced off the pace up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the two path and was outkicked in the lane. AERONAUT dueled on the
inside up the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the turn and tired in the stretch. BRUCE BANNER pressed the pace between horses
early, raced in the two path around the turn and faded in the lane.
