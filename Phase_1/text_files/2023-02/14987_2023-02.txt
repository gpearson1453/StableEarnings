Footnotes
CAVIAR RESOLUTION stalked the top pair from the four path before tucking behind them around the first turn, pursued before tipping back outside of them
in upper stretch, produced a grinding rally while hanging on her left lead to bid at the furlong grounds, forged an advantage before dueling with an inner
game rival through the late stages, and narrowly prevailed. MAGICAL STARDUST set the pace along the inside, showed the way from an outer vying rival
around the far turn, repelled that foe in upper stretch as an outer CAVIAR RESOLUTION menaced, got headed by that one leaving the furlong pole, yet
fought on gamely to the wire, but failed to regain even terms. HAPPY SAILS pressed two wide, vied around the far turn, but yielded between horses coming
to the furlong grounds. MEG AND CLAIR lagged behind, then surpassed a tired rival. LUMBERJACK EMPIRE lacked speed along the inside, and tired.

Footnotes
LONE STAR MAX set the pace inside of a prompting foe, shook free of that bidding rival entering the lane, and drove clear while hanging on his left lead.
IRON FORTUNE bumped with an outer rival at the start, was hustled soon after to forward inside position behind the top pair, tipped outside of them at the
three furlong pole, but was driven to the five path in to the process, continued to bear to the seven path entering the lane, claimed place while lugging
inwardly at the three sixteenths pole, continued to wander about after changing to his right lead at the furlong grounds, and ran on to prove second best.
MINE YOUR BIZ lacked speed in the five path, then stayed on while hanging on his left lead, and gained show late. THEOS FLEW pressed two wide, but
failed to keep pace with the leader at the quarter pole, and gave way. ELIEZER bumped with an inner rival at the start before brushing an outer foe in the
aftermath, lacked speed in the two path, then failed to factor on his left lead. WILD FIST took a light nudge from an inner rival soon after the start, saved
ground while trailing around the turn, and never got involved. CAME OUT KICKIN tracked in the four path around the turn, but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
BOOTSIE'S GALAXY stalked from between horses, steadied into the turn, passed leaders from outside, closed strong for the win. SECRET VISTA stalked
the pace from the inside, awaited racing room turning for home as an outer rival got a jump, slipped through a narrow rail seam leaving the quarter pole,
attempted a bid inside of the newly clear aforementioned foe in midstretch, but was no match in the final furlong and had to settle for second best.
CRYPTOZONIC trailed early, traveled wide through the turn, swung six wide at the quarter pole, and passed tired rivals and secured the show spot. JEB'S
LUCKY EIGHT was within striking distance early outside of the leader, challenged in the three path around the turn, but gave way between rivals entering
the lane. YOUNG TUSCAN slightly brushed with an inner rival at the start, set the pace early, but was headed by bidders on either side in upper stretch, and
gave way on his left lead. ALTERANA was washed out in the post parade, raced forwardly outside of the top pair, tracked from the five path around the turn,
but had no finish.

Footnotes
MYSTERIOUS SPIRIT stalked two wide, led with five sixteenths to go, and drove clear entering the lane. INFINITESIMAL broke slowly, tracked from the
three path, pursued the clearing leader from the four path nearing the lane, and ran on to be second best. RONALDS GATSBY broke out and bumped a
rival at the start, tracked along the inside, then surpassed an inner rival for show while failing to keep pace with the top pair in upper stretch. STAR READY
set the pace along the inside, but offered little resistance to the eventual winner's bid at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened through the lane while
hanging on his left lead. BROTHER JEFF saved ground towards the rear, but to no avail. ALL TOGETHER lacked speed while taking a brush from an inner
foe in the four path into the first turn, tucked to the three path around that bend, and failed to factor thereafter. HARD KINGS laid off of the pace in the five to
four paths and between horses early on, and was done early. CARROLL CREEK was being corrected by the assistant starter when the gates sprung, came
out slow before taking a bump from an inner rival, then lacked speed raced off of the pace in the six to five paths around the first turn, was through after a
half mile, and eased. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO START, CARROLL CREEK WAS DEEMED TO HAVE HAD AN UNFAIR START, AND
WAS DECLARED A NON-STARTER.

Footnotes
SENSE YOU LEFT gunned for the lead going into the first turn, settled in the second tier while being in the three path, stalked the leader until the half mile
pole, where he collared TOTAL MALICE, took control of the race, was driven out of the turn, and wrapped up after securing the win. WHY BEHAVE
challenged for the lead going into the first turn from the inside, settled in the second tier, and chased the rest of the race while able to maintain the place
spot. ROYA tried for early lead into the turn, settled for the second tier, was moved out in the turn, passed tired rivals and maintained the place position.
JUST PASSING THRU was no threat. ANGEL OF VERDUN not involved early, passed a tired rival. TOTAL MALICE sent early four wide into first turn to
secure the lead, was collared at the half pole by the eventual winner, gave way and tired.

Footnotes
SULTRY LASS bumped with an outer rival soon after the start, prompted the pace along the inside into the first turn, but was wrangled back to a stalking
position around that turn, pursued comfortably from behind the leaders around the far turn, tipped two wide entering the lane to take aim, bid in upper
stretch, cleared at the furlong grounds, and drew off with good energy. BLAME THE TOLL set the pace in the two path, dug in to resist SULTRY LASS's bid
in upper stretch, but offered little resistance at the furlong grounds, and pulled well clear of show. MAGIC PALACE tracked four to three wide, pressed
around the far turn, but failed to keep pace nearing the lane, and held show thereafter. TRANSPARENCY took a bump from outer rivals at the start, then
was put to crowded quarters in the opening stages, tracked along the inside, got slightly shuffled back while under a hard hold in the latter half of the first tur,
shifted out nearing the far turn to chase the leader from the four to five path around that bend, then lacked a bid. KIKI KRAZY was antsy in the post parade,
then was bumped by an outer rival into an inner foe at the start, lacked speed in the four path, and faded around the far turn before surpassing stopping
rivals. LOTSANDLOTSOFGOLD leaned in and bumped a rival at the start, trailed while rank around the first turn, and made little impact. SURREY took a
bump to her hind quarters soon after the start, raced forwardly two wide and between horses while under snug restraint around the first turn, and faded
down the backstretch. JACKIE FLASH stalked three to two wide, but weakened between horses around the far turn.

Footnotes
SHE'S LOOKIN LUCKY pressed two wide, led at the three furlong pole, drew off under driving pressure in upper stretch, and was put to wraps in the final
furlong. BOLTORO stalked the top pair from the inside, chased them from the three path around the far turn, gained place nearing the lane as the leader
kicked clear, and was clearly second best. SALSALITA VERDE took a bump from an inner rival at the start, trailed into the far turn, gained four wide
entering the lane, and stayed on willingly. LAYLA'S SONG tracked three wide, but gave way in the four path around the far turn. CAMP AKEELA set the
pace inside of the eventual winner, but was headed at the three furlong pole, and weakened. CALM COOL saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. MO
LOVIN bobbled and bumped an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack two wide and between horses around the first turn, but failed to sustain that
position down the backstretch, and faded around the far turn. THE MILE FRACTION WAS OMITTED

Footnotes
NEW YEAR'S PARTY stalked along the inside, slipped through to bid for the lead inside of the pace setter in upper stretch, and drew clear leaving the
furlong grounds. PEACEFUL VISION tracked in the four path, ranged up in the five path entering the lane, but was floated outwardly while getting outkicked
by a ground-saving rival in upper stretch, and ran on to be second best. KASEN'S SISTER set the pace in the two path, but was headed by a rail bidder at
the furlong grounds, and gave way. THEBOYZGALAXY stalked outside of the pace setter, but yielded while lugging out entering the lane, and chased
through the final furlong. KEHRON'S CREED lacked speed in the three path, and failed to menace. BLONDIE LOX BABE bumped with an inner rival at the
start, and never got involved. CANDY'S PRIDE broke a step slow before bumping with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the five path, and
tired.
