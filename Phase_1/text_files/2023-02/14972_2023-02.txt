Footnotes
LEAN ON E hustled to the front inside, shook loose after the half, widened in the stretch and remained clear under steady handling. SUGAR STREAK six
wide on the first turn, remained very wide and closed well in the final eighth. LONDONDERRY moved closer three wide between rivals on the final turn and
continued willingly. BRODY SLAM dropped back early then advanced wide with a mild rally. WHYISSHESOOLUCKY trailed briefly, moved up inside then
proved empty in the stretch. MANI PEDI saved ground off the leaders and was finished after half a mile. FAST INTENTIONS prompted the winner outside to
the far turn then stopped. SOUTHERN CENTS was urged just off the early pace then gave way readily.

SHAKING RAGS raced three wide early, then stalked two wide, bid on the far turn, took over, drew clear, then held sway under urging in the stretch. CAN'T
COMPLAIN set the pace on the inside, briefly dueled with the winner on the turn, chased that rival into the stretch, angled out and dug in outside and stayed
on to the end. TEXAS TANGIE tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly. CIVIL NOTION raced three wide off
the pace, chased two wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. ROYAL PARTY raced two wide off the pace, chased inside on the far turn and did not
factor. JSK LUCKY'S PUSHPA raced off the pace inside and gave way.

NAVY RULES prompted the pace outside, bid to the front at the top of the stretch then edged away while kept to his task. HARLEY'S CHARLY lacked
speed, advanced strongly inside, loomed a threat but was outfinished. MY IMAGINATION lagged far behind, raced inside throughout, finished well and was
just up for the show. TATUM hustled to the front inside, led past the quarter pole, was collared into the stretch and tired. IT'S A PITY flashed speed in the
two path, moved inside on the turn then faltered in the stretch. KAIQUE outrun early, made a menacing five wide move on the turn then faltered. FINALLY
CAPTURED moved closer into the far turn, bid wide on the turn then gave way.

Footnotes
OLYMPIC ROMP tracked close up on the inside, saved ground on the far turn, came two wide into the lane, rallied between rivals, angled to the rail, closed
willingly inside and drew clear in deep stretch. PLAMEN raced three wide early, stalked three wide, bid on the far turn, dueled with COBBLE ROAD, gained
a short lead, edged away in upper stretch, dug in gamely in the final furlong but second best. JUMP FOR ALEX raced off the pace, moved up on the far
turn, went three wide at the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane, rallied outside and dug in late to earn the show spot. VISUAL ARTIST pressed the
pace racing close up two wide, chased between rivals on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, bid and was outkicked. COBBLE ROAD set the pace
racing near the inside, dueled with PLAMEN on the far turn, dug in gamely in upper stretch and weakened late. NICK PAPAGIORGIO raced four wide early,
settled off the rail, off the pace, went four wide past the quarter pole and gave way.

Footnotes
MOON DOG rushed to the front inside, widened in hand on the final turn then remained safe while kept to a drive. BEACHWALKER moved closer after half
a mile, pursued the winner but was second best. HOMETOWN HERO lacked speed under a firm hold, advanced inside and continued willingly in the
stretch. PREDOMINATE trailed early, circled his field on the final turn then flattened out. VERBIER prompted the winner for five furlongs and faltered.
NEVER CHANGE raced close up three wide then weakened steadily. FORMAL ORDER chased just off the leaders inside then stopped on the final turn.
