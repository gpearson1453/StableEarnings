Footnotes
CHARTER OAK fell back off the pace while outside, came four wide for the drive, brushed with WHISKEY DOUBLE past the furlong marker, keep coming
with good resolve to be up in the final strides. BURNINHUNKOFLOVE broke on top, raced with the first flight on the outside up the backstretch, continued to
vie four wide through the turn, held a narrow advantage past the furlong marker and gave ground grudgingly to the winner late to miss. UPSTRIKER vied up
front while between rivals, dueled upper stretch, could not match the top two the final furlong, saved the show. WHISKEY DOUBLE last away, raced back
and off the pace, steered out three wide turning for home, brushed with the winner a furlong out, flattened out to finish up evenly. BEST OF GREELEY broke
with the leaders, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, gradually weakened through the lane. MEAN JAKEY vied up front three wide
and between horses, also began to weaken with the real running began entering the stretch. WHOOPING JAY fell back to trail soon after the start, was
never a threat while three wide.

Footnotes
FAMILY TRADITION hesitated at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, continued back up the backstretch and into the turn well wide, four path
through the bend, roused for the drive, closed with good energy to win going away at the end. DANCIN ROCKET forwardly placed along the inside for a
half, moved to challenge when straightened for home, dueled late, proved no match for the winner, narrowly held the place. ORDER OF MERIT behind the
place in the three path early, idled along in the two path out of the turn, launched a late run past the furlong marker and finished willingly to be getting to the
runner up while also proving no match for the winner. KRUSIN ROCKET broke alertly, narrowly set the pace along the inside, continued to battle inside the
furlong marker, weakened late to be caught for the show. SHOTGUN UP underwent a shoe repair after the post parade, broke with the field, three wide turn
when well off the inside, staged a mild rally to improve position. LOBO IRISH in mid pack while racing well wide, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting,
failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. PIKACHU broke out, bumped with FALCONITE to be away slowly, saved ground while still well back
turn, improved position without posing a threat down the stretch. JOE BILL broke with the leaders, raced outside behind the first flight, four wide turn,
weakened in the drive. SUNSIGN broke back, two path through the turn, passed tiring rivals. FALCONITE broke in and bumped with PIKACHU, was quickly
righted to force the pace in the two path for four furlongs, gave way for the drive. WORK ALL DAY away in good order, prompted the issue up front for four
furlongs and also backed up through the lane. GUARDED off a step slow, moved up to race in mid pack, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
FUNNY UNCLE closest to the leader while in the two path, bid between foes far turn, dueled into the stretch, put that foe away just before being joined by
the runner up, dug in late to narrowly prevail. TAHOE RUN settled off the pace and the inside, advanced three wide turning for home, challenged outside the
winner with a furlong remaining, outkicked in the late going while between horses. MOUNT CRAIG off a step slow, lacked speed inside, two path into the far
turn, steered out for the drive, finished willingly to be steadily getting to the top two late. GOIN TO THE SHOW broke alertly, forwardly placed three wide,
challenged on the outside of the winner in the final turn, dueled into the stretch and began to weaken. ATLANTIC DANCER broke back, lacked speed, raced
in the two path through the final turn, failed to rally. PATROLMAN four wide into the first turn, moved in a bit to be three wide, continued three wide far bend,
four wide into the lane, also came up empty for the drive. WHITEROSE JEWEL void of speed, was always outrun to be well beaten. EYE AM SMART
sprinted well clear after the start, set a quick opening quarter, stopped after a half, far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
HOMECOMING QUEEN broke alertly, allowed the pace to go early while saving ground, angled out four wide turning into the stretch, steady rally to be up in
time. BEAUTIFUL AND BOLD took command after the start, continued to show the way up the backstretch in hand, shook briefly clear when entering the
stretch, responded when the winner challenged with less than a furlong remaining, proved stubborn to the end. STELLAR LADY back off the pace while just
off the rail early, dropped inside second turn, waited, slight steady, regathered and advanced on the leaders once again with less than a furlong remaining,
once again lacked room a sixteenth out, altered course to the inside, finished willingly to miss the place. NEED SOME MONEY in tight and steadied along
the rail midway on the first turn, continued back, two path into the second bend, angled three wide for the drive, chased the lead pack past the furlong
marker, made little progress on the top three late. MIDNIGHT HEIRESS pressed the runner up off the inside for six furlongs, had little left for the stretch run.
STRIKINGLY SPUN failed to menace with a three wide trip. JUNIORS JOANIE forwardly placed early, squeezed back from between horses into the far turn,
dropped inside, lacked a response stretch, vanned off. FABULOUS CANDY broke back, lacked speed, moved a bit closer four wide turning for home,
flattened out through the stretch.

Footnotes
CACTUS outrun in the early going while moving out, steered out a bit more to be four wide out of the turn, set down for the run to the wire, finished with
good courage to kicked down the two leaders late. MANTA REY in the second flight early while outside, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting when
moving closer, challenged when straightened for home, led late, could not contain the winner while prevailing for the place. KYANDI took command along
the inside early, dueled into the turn, continued to hold a narrow advantage past midstretch, gave ground grudgingly to the top two late. ETERNALLY
GRATEFUL hesitated to be off slowly, trailed for a half, two path through the turn, finished up willingly to improve position. SERGEANT COUNTZLER lacked
speed just off the inside, worked way out to be four wide turning for home, improved position without posing a serious threat. SPARKIN went one paced
while saving ground. ONCE UPON A DREAM broke outward and back, back off the pace inside, continued one paced through the stretch. MOON
CONNECTION in the second flight while three wide early, began to fall back in the turn, no factor stretch. EL MONGO pressed the issue early up the
backstretch stretch, shuffled back between the two leaders into the turn, continued to fade through the stretch. SIX WHIPS dueled up front in the two path
into and through the turn, gave way through the lane.

TAKE CHARGE GENT in the second flight along the inside for five furlongs, moved out a bit and advanced in the two path to challenge second turn, shook
clear inside the furlong marker, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. MR. TIP stumbled at the break, settled back off the pace inside, moved out, two
path backstretch, closer, traffic late in the final turn, eased out, clear for the drive, slowly getting to the winner late. GEORGIA DEPUTY off a step slow, void
of speed inside, continued to lag far turn inside, picked up and moved out to be four to five wide into the lane, widest drive, finished up willingly.
GENERATOR broke very sharp, set the pace inside, continued to narrowly show the way the middle half, responded when confronted by the winner in
upper stretch, caved in late to lose a couple of more positions. MAJOR KONG off a step slow, raced back and in the two path, dropped inside midway on
the final turn, improved position and was also showing some energy late. PRIMER DIMER four wide when with the main body first turn, continued outside,
was four wide again through the second bend, lacked a closing response to finish up evenly. BOLDISH in tight just after the start, failed to menace.
OPTIMUS KAT settled off the pace and the inside, three wide through the first turn, three to four wide second bend, also failed to produce a closing kick.
INCORRIGIBLE forwardly placed off the inside, three wide second turn, faltered in the drive. SEE SPOT RUN four wide into the first turn when lacking
speed, four wide through the second, remained back through the stretch. MORNING SNOW pressed the leader off the inside for five furlongs, stopped in
the second turn.

Footnotes
GUN PILOT broke with the field, settled off the pace inside in hand, continued to save ground into the second turn, pinned down through the first half of that
bend, fell back slightly then responded immediately when asked with five sixteenths remaining, angled out, set down, collared leader from the outside with a
sixteenth remaining and kicked clear with authority in a sharp effort. BOURBON BASH stalked the pace while three wide and firmly in hand, continued to be
patiently handled into the far turn, took over in the three path, clear when straightened for home, proved no match for the winner late, clearly second best.
PROTEGE prompted the leader from the two path, lodged a brief bid between horses and inside the runner up midway on the final turn, could no keep jup
with that one through upper stretch nor prove a match for the winner, held the show late. GUNFLASH settled off the pace and the inside, came in the two
path for the drive, not enough for the show while also proving no match for the top pair. COFFEE CALIENTE settled off the pace and the inside, four wide
into the far turn, failed to respond for the drive. C. J'S STORM took control soon after the start, showed the way for five furlongs then faltered when headed
midway on the final turn. VIGORISH off slowly, rank while attempting to get out into the first turn, fell further and further back, distanced after losing contact
with the field, jogged in.

dueled inside that one upper stretch then could not keep up, lasted for the place. BOAT SONG forwardly placed inside, steadied in tight along the rail with a
half mile remaining, continued in traffic late in the turn, clear for the drive, getting to the runner up late. MR CREED last to leave, raced back along the
inside, continued to save ground into the stretch, staged a mild rally to improve position. ST ANDREWS in the second flight off the inside, came three wide
into the stretch, lacked a closing response. LUCKY DUDE lacked speed, went one paced while three to four wide through the turn. CROW'S NEST broke
back, raced in the two path through the turn, made little impact through the lane. COMMANDER CARL broke well, sprinted clear soon after, set the pace for
a half along the inside, gave way when headed. DEUS EX MACHINA in mid pack while racing three wide, continued in that path through the turn, tired

going, remained clear for the place. LE DA VIDA (CHI) broke well, settled off the pace on the outside first turn, moved inside for the run through the second
bend, closest while saving ground into the lane, flattened out in the final furlong. ICE ORCHID within striking distance while racing off the inside, three wide
through the final turn, came up empty for the stretch. POWDER RIVER settled off the pace in the three path, had little left for the drive. GRAYSONSMACHO
GAL pressed the issue early, dueled up the backstretch outside the runner up, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
WILLOW CREEK ROAD floated in at the break, moved closer just off the inside up the backstretch, two path through the turn, tipped out for the drive,
finished with good energy to prove best and was edging clear late. SKYPED forwardly placed from the start outside, vied five wide into the turn, three wide
into the lane, led a furlong out, could not match the winner late, clearly second best. SHAKE UP vied early three wide and between horses, fell back turn,
came four wide for the drive, along for the show, no threat to the top two late. STUCK N SNOW broke in, straightened to contest the pace up the
backstretch, weakened through the lane. PEARCY ROAD bothered to be off slow, raced back, came four wide out of the turn, displayed a modest amount of
late interest to improve position a bit. HACKER with the pace while in the two path and between horses for a half, weakened. BOLIVER broke in to be off
slowly, raced back, improved inside of horses through the turn, not a real threat through the lane in finishing up evenly. CLASSY SOCKS off a step slow,
raced mid pack and three wide into and through the turn, had little for the drive. SINGING GROOM fell back to trail after the start, was not a factor.
KISSOFTHENILE vied up front while four wide early, gave way early in the turn. COLONEL BARTON back off the pace toward the inside, steadied slightly
into the turn, fell back and trailed home.
