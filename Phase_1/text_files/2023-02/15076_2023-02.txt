strides. MR HOOVER raced off the pace in the two and three paths the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three and
four paths and ran evenly in the lane. NOVA BOY was shuffled back early and raced in the three path the first turn, left the turn outside, bid mildly
approaching the three eighths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. ROCKET APPEAL stalked the early pace from the three
path, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then weakened inside the sixteenth pole. MACY'S BOY saved

Footnotes
JUBA'S NOTION rounded the first turn in the four path and left the turn outside, closed to the front past the three eighths pole, raced at the rail into the far
turn, bore out approaching the top of the lane but corrected course, dug in under steady handling and just lasted. R B'S THE BOSS rated close inside, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, dueled through the stretch for second and just missed the win. GABRIEL'S WING
rounded the first turn in the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, angled wide to get around Juba's Notion
leaving the turn then relented in the stretch duel for second. ISLAND D'LITE stalked the early pace, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn about the three path then weakened. URBAN BANDIT saved ground. BRISTOL CHANNEL rated the pace, was met leaving the three
eighths pole and gave chase from that point, but dropped back approaching the quarter pole and weakened at the rail on the far turn. DAREDAVITE was
never a factor. The Stewards reviewed, then dismissed, a claim of foul against the rider of Juba's Notion for alleged interference leaving the far turn, lodged
by the rider of Gabriel's Wing.

Footnotes
EDICT stalked the early pace from the two and three paths, took the lead two deep approaching the nine sixteenths pole and was rated from that point,
came under pressure leaving the three eighths, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, drifted in the upper stretch but dug in under steady
handling to hold on. EXCALIBUR rated close to the early pace inside then eased out and stalked leaving the second turn, challenged past the seven
sixteenths pole, raced close two deep on the far turn, drifted mid-stretch but came back to finish well. LOST IN MANHATTAN raced off the pace in the three
and four paths, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then dueled through the stretch for third. FINAL SAY
settled off the pace about the four path, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path then relented in the stretch duel for
third. TRIPLE JEOPARDY raced off the pace about the four path, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five
path and flattened inside the eighth pole. SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR saved early ground then eased out past the half mile pole, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths, raced in the five path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. LIQUID LOUIE raced off the pace about the five path, picked up the chase
leaving the half mile pole then faded nearing the far turn. TAPPIN FOR GLORY settled off the pace and off the rail, gave chase past the seven sixteenths
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened into the lane. MUSICAL AMERICA set the early pace inside, was met nearing the nine sixteenths pole
and gave brief chase, but faded through the backstretch and was eased the final quarter mile.
