Footnotes
POST FACTO stalked behind the leader on the inside, tipped out on the far turn and bid between rivals at the quarter pole and may have been struck by
rivals whip but was hardly affected, took over into the stretch, showed the way into the final sixteenth and held gamely. PAULLIAC (IRE) unhurried in the
beginning three then two wide, traveled outside a rival into the far turn, was on the move while angling four wide leaving the bend, fought outside rivals
through the stretch and lacked the needed final kick to get by. KOLOMIO stalked the top pair two wide early, bid three deep with a quarter mile left to run,
fought between rivals in the furlong grounds and got edged for second. ZIO JO settled next the fence, tipped out into the stretch, angled out further from
behind rivals, tried to rally in a tight spot between rivals in the final sixteenth, managed to through but ran out of time. ZOOKEEPER bobbled leaving the
gate, set the pace under pressure from outside rival, shook free past the three-eighths pole, challenged by a pair of rivals at the quarter pole, lost command
into the stretch and weakened. LAMPY pressed while keen early on the first turn, continued to prompt the pace up the backstretch, failed to keep up past
the three-eighths pole, dropped back around the bend and tired.

Footnotes
ZIMBA WARRIOR turned his head at the start to come away last, tracked two then three wide early, bid three deep leaving the far turn, dueled into the final
sixteenth with CLUB ASPEN and dug in to inch ahead late. CLUB ASPEN set the pace under mild pressure in the early stages, led clear to the quarter pole,
challenged by rivals into the stretch, maintained command into the final furlong, dueled with ZIMBA WARRIOR into deep stretch and yielded grudgingly in
the end. IMPOSSIBLE TASK stalked the pace from inside, got put in a bit tight by SETTECENTO on the far turn and dropped to last, tipped out in the lane
and finished gamely through traffic to earn the show honors. SALTO DE TIGRE settled inside then moved to the two path around the clubhouse turn, rallied
three then four wide outside the top trio into the stretch but failed to find the needed late kick in deep stretch. SETTECENTO raced up close outside the
leader applying mild pressure at times, chased two wide through the far turn and into the stretch and faltered in the late stages.

NENE DIAMOND took a bump from outside at the start, sprinted clear early, drew away along the rail around the bend, urged right handed with a furlong left
to run, switched to the left hand midstretch and held safely. GENERAL WELFARE away quickly in the beginning, chased the pacesetter two to three wide
into the lane, could not threaten the winner in the late stages but managed to hold the place. BAJAN BASHERT chased outside GENERAL WELFARE up
the backstretch, kept off the rail and entered the lane three to four wide and could not get by GENERAL WELFARE for second. ASHLEYS SANDCASTLE
chased along the inside into and around the bend and weakened in the stretch run. IDESSIA tossed her head slightly and came away a step slow on the
outside, raced in range well off the rail, exited the bend four to five wide and weakened. MISS JO'S CANDY broke a step slow and bumped with inner rival
at the start, lagged behind up the backstretch, trailed three then two wide around the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
CRIMSON ROSE sped clear and crossed over, confidently ridden while saving ground around the bend, asked left handed midstretch and held well. LA
AGUILILLA got shuffled between rivals crossing back onto the turn early, traveled along the inside then angled out four wide with a quarter mile left to run,
rallied widest in the stretch but was not enough. BIG BEAUTY chased just out of range outside a rival leaving the backstretch, moved out three deep at the
quarter pole, came back to the two path entering the stretch and closed the gap on the winner while getting outfinished for second. MAJESTIC STEPS (IRE)
got bumped from inside leaving the gate, stalked outside a rival into the turn, raced between foes at the quarter pole then suffered a mild shuffle into the
stretch and weakened. MENDHAM MILL broke out and bumped rival, stalked the pacesetter off the rail then moved inside, saved ground around the bend,
got bothered by BIG BEAUTY coming in a bit in upper stretch and faded. BLOSSOMING broke a step slow from the inside, drifted out after crossing back
onto the turn, trailed under right handed urging into the stretch, steered out in the lane and could not rally.

Footnotes
KATONAH vied between rivals early, dueled inside BOOK SMART past the five-sixteenths pole, inched ahead to take control in the lane and dug in late to
hold that rival at bay. BOOK SMART vied three deep to the turn, dueled outside KATONAH past the five-sixteenths pole, kept the pressure on through the
lane but lacked the needed punch to get by. INDULGE bumped with outer rival at the start, settled at the back, passed a rival while saving ground around
the bend, moved out in the lane and showed late effort to earn the show honors. AMERICAN CAT vied inside a pair of rivals to the turn, could not keep pace
midway around the bend, angled out and chased four wide into the stretch, then weakened in the furlong grounds. SUZIE QZZ BROTHER bumped with
INDULGE leaving the gate, stalked the speedy trio on the inside into the turn, eased off the rail and came four wide into the stretch and could not rally.
GRAZEN SUN stalked well off the rail early on, went four wide into the turn, came five wide into the stretch and also failed to rally. STREET ART broke a
step slow, traveled three wide around the turn and came up empty.

moved out to the two path, waited behind the leaders on the far turn, went between foes in the lane and finished willingly to gain the show honors. DELTA

Footnotes
YO TIME was closest in pursuit from the two path to the far turn, challenged from outside around the bend, gained the upper hand entering the stretch,
moved clear with a furlong remaining and remained strong to the wire. HERECOMEGEORGIEBOY settled outside a rival early on, moved out nearing the
far turn, rallied four deep then challenged outside the top pair into the stretch, was outkicked by YO TIME in the final furlong but was clearly second best.
BRONKO NAGURSKI stalked the pace from between rivals, roused on the far turn while two to three wide, moved out in the lane and nailed WORKDAY for
the show honors. WORKDAY sprinted to the front and crossed over to the inside, showed the way to the far turn, challenged by YO TIME around the bend,
gave up the lead entering the stretch, flattened in the furlong grounds and lost the show. STAR PROSPECT pulled on the inside while a bit rank, stalked the
pace then moved off the rail at the top of the stretch, kept on through the lane while going between rivals late and missed the minor awards. SHIP AND
SCAM settled on the inside, looked to gain on the far turn but ran into traffic, remained inside into the stretch and could not rally. J D'S RUDE BOY stalked
the pacesetter outside a pair of rivals, got shuffled back nearing the five-sixteenths pole, chased three wide into the lane and had little left for the drive.
MICKEY GOLDMILL was off slow in the beginning, traveled along the inside towards the rear, moved out on the backstretch, went five deep into the far turn,
spun four wide into the lane and failed to menace. LE VRON JAMES was off slow to begin, trailed two wide early, eased on the far turn and coasted through
the stretch, then walked off following the race.
