sixteenths and then widened the margin to prove best, driving. CHEROKEE PARTY dueled for the lead and made a bid on the inside on the turn to shake
clear, then was headed by the winner leaving the turn and could not go with that rivals, second best. FOLK HERO dueled for the lead three wide, then
stalked the pace four wide by the quarter pole and weakened, stayed on for the show award. RISQUE'S JEWEL was allowed to settle on the inside and had
no rally. HAY NINETEEN tracked the pace three wide, made a mild bid on the turn and was five wide by the quarter pole, empty in the drive.

ATHENA BEACH was reluctant to load, vied for the early lead on the outside, made a three wide bid to shake clear on the turn, then drew off in the lane to
prove much the best under a drive. FREYDIS tracked the early pace towards the inside, made a three wide bid on the turn but could not go with the winner
in the lane, second best. I'M HEADING EAST vied for the lead on the inside, shifted off the inside nearing the quarter pole and weakened. MORGANS
COVE was slow into stride, advanced on the turn and came four wide into the lane, lugged in by the three sixteenths and had no rally. NEWSDLEY was
settled early, saved ground on the turn and had no rally. WEST ABBOTT chased the pace three wide and weakened. OUT OF AMMO was off slowly and
not a factor. DREAMINGOFROYALTY failed to menace.
