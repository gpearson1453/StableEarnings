Footnotes
STONEMONT REUNION unhurried back of the pack, swept up through the far turn, continued to wire and prevailed to the wire. NOISES OFF inside run
never far back, shuffled back into far turn turn, raced on and led late but nailed on the wire. ROYAL SANDRIN saved ground throughout, ran on well in the
stretch for show. QUALITY CHIC bit tardy, raced well back, finished up well with a troubled trip. SCAT TU TAP raced between horses first turn, middle
move, ran into trouble into far turn and into stretch, kept on in the stretch run after an eventful trip . WHAT A BLAST sent to the front, hooked into far turn,
gave way from inside. BOOK OF KELLS outside run to quarter pole, shuffled turn, never recovered. MAMBA FOREVER chased pace to far turn, gave way
into the stretch. DUBAI AND BACK (IRE) unhurried while always back with no response when needed. GLEN AIRY never factored throughout. MIDNIGHT
NOIR bounced around first turn between horses, never recovered.
