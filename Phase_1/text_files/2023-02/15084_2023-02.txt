Footnotes
LOOK UP TO HEAVEN tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the two and three path coming around the turn and dueled in
the lane to hold the victory. CHARGE IT JENN stalked the pace setters on the outside early, dueled from the four path around the turn and continued to
battle in the stretch to narrowly miss. OUR FANTASY dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the bend and in
upper stretch and was outkicked late. MA MEATLOAF led the way between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two and three path
around the bend and weakened in the lane. MELANCHOLY BLUES raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three
path and never threatened. WORKING OVERTIME trailed the field throughout, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.

WICKED SAUCY tracked the leader on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, launched a bid from the three path coming around the bend and
dueled down the lane, getting outkicked near the wire. RIPLEY EFFECT trailed the field on the outside early, began to move up from the two path headed
into the turn and continued to improve position in the lane. REDZILLA pressed the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and
was outkicked in the stretch. LEGEND'S SONG raced in the middle of the pack between horses early, came around the turn in the four path and finished
evenly while never threatening. BYZANTINE EMPIRE bumped lightly with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack for the
run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and faded in the lane. JOYOUS FAIRY TALE raced off the pace on the outside up the
backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and made no bid. ALBA MIA bumped with the horse to his inside at the break, raced off the pace up
the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was empty from there. OUR LA DOLCE VITA chased the leader between horses through the opening

Footnotes
POSSIBLEMENTE raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, began to move up while racing in the two path around the far
turn and continued to gain ground in the stretch to get up for the win late. JOE'S HAD ENOUGH hit the gate leaving it, saved ground around the first turn,
settled in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid coming around the far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and was caught after
drifting out late. HUASTECO flipped his head up leaving the gate, raced in the four path early, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack
between horses, improved position while racing in the two path around the far bend and continued to gain ground in the stretch. FLAWLESS CAT led the
field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the second bend and weakened in the final furlong.
SOUTHPAW MIKE saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the three and four path around the far turn and gained
ground mildly in the lane while never truly threatening. BRAMBLE BLAZE raced in the three path around the first turn, settled off the pace for the run up the
backstretch, saved ground around the far bend and was empty in the lane. KING SPARROW chased the leader on the outside through the opening half
mile, dropped back while racing in the three path around the far turn and continued to tire in the stretch. PLEASANT VALIANT raced in the five path around
the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two path and faded in the lane.

GOLOVKIN raced off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground to just get
up for the win. RIDGEPOINTE stalked the pace setter on the outside early, challenged from the four path coming around the bend and dueled to the wire,
getting caught in the final jump. VINNIE VAN GO dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path coming around the turn
and was outkicked in late stretch. BAZOO dueled on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and kept on in the lane. ROYAL
SQUEEZE trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn, swung wider still entering the stretch and passed tiring horses in the
lane. BAHAMIAN DUDE tracked the leader on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the bend from the three path and faded in the
stretch. I'M MONEY dueled between horses up the backstretch, dropped back while racing in the two path around the bend and continued to tire from there.
