Footnotes
BODEMONSTER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew off.
NEXT JOURNEY sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and yielded to the winner through the
final furlong. TOUR THE WORLD broke sharply then lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, second turn, angled out in mid-stretch, reached a
contending position but failed to gain late. GUARDSMAN PASS chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way after going three-quarters.
SOLANDER was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid.

COMPANY'S DREAM broke sharply to duel for the lead with COASTAL FOG while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and
quickly drew off. COASTAL FOG dueled for the lead with the winner while racing four-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but held on for the place.
SIX SHOTS OF T was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. HE'S A FLYIN lacked early foot,
raced four-wide through the turn and finished evenly. SUGAR SHANE was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not menace.
ENDALE ARCH lagged early, saved ground and did not offer a bid. LEFT THE BAR raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and
weakened.

six-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. RONAMO showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor.
ROCKYMOUNTAINTWIST settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened. SILVERBULLITBADGER lacked early foot, raced
five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

BLESSED JOURNEY tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew off with
complete authority. MIKE OPERATOR was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, met the bid of PAINT ME LUCKY nearing
the five-sixteenths pole, angled in nearing the sixteenth marker and finished willingly. PAINT ME LUCKY was reserved just off the leaders from between
foes, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths marker, opened a clear margin approaching the stretch and gave way through the final furlong.
RUN TAPPY showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out nearing the quarter, back inside into the lane and finished evenly.
BODEGA was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn and did not threaten. NORTHERN QUEST lacked early foot, raced four-wide
through the second turn and was not a factor. VICTORY BOULEVARD was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn and did not
menace. BIG BARREL chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. HELLO HANDSOME settled off the leaders early, moved
five-wide through the second turn and weakened. REELFOOT raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the second turn, weakened and
was eased through the lane.

THIRTY SECONDS OUT broke sharply to press the pace of COASTAL WATERS while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the
three-eighths marker, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole, increased her margin into the lane and was fully extended to hold CXOASTAL
WATERS safe late. COASTAL WATERS settled off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive, could not reach the winner in the drive but
finished well to gain the place. BOB'S ALL IN was off a step slow, lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn, angled out in mid-stretch and
and finished with good late energy. ZUMURUDEE showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. FORT
LANGLEY was off a step slow then forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened. SWEET SAVANT was away in good
order to set a pressured pace from the inside, checked nearing the quarter, weakened and was eased through the lane.
