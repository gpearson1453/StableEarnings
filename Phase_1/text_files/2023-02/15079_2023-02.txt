Footnotes
MUMBLEBEE broke well, allowed the pace to go into the first turn, remained within striking distance in the second flight up the backstretch, crept closer
behnd traffic late in the final turn, continued to be covered up in upper stretch, altered course to the far outside past the furlong marker, roused, finished with
good energy to win going away. LIL'S TURN lacked speed while saving ground, moved closer inside the winner midway on the second turn, also caught up
in traffic entering the stretch, split foes to take command with less than a furlong remaining, proved no match for the winner late, clearly second best. HISSY
MISSY within striking distance while racing outside, three bid late in the final turn, vied past the furlong marker, could not match the top two late, clear of the
others. CAGED BEAR went one paced throughout on the outside, lacked a closing kick. DORITA'S HEART dueled up front off the inside, between horses
into the stretch, continued to battle on past the furlong marker, faltered late. SILENT SCARLET narrowly set the early pace inside, dueled the middle half,
gave way past the furlong marker. WICKED CHOCOLATE fell back to trail after the start, trailed, never menaced.

Footnotes
POUT dueled into the first turn outside, continued to alternated up front in the run up the backstretch, disposed of the other speed by midway on the final
turn, clearly best under firm handling. WINDY BAY closest to the dueling leaders off the inside, moved a bit closer in the three path second turn, proved no
match for the winner in the drive, well clear of the others. REAUX BINA void of early foot while four wide into the first turn, continued outside while improving
far turn, lacked a further advance on the top two, well clear of the others. I GOT A NAME broke with the field, alternated up front along the inside, gave way
in the final turn. SAENGER STAR in the second flight while racing off the inside, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. FIRST RATE
ROMANCE void of speed while one path off the inside, made little impact. SWEET TRUFFLES settled off the pace while along the inside, saved ground to
no avail.

Footnotes
PENETRATOR away in good order, stalked the dueling leaders in hand into and through the turn, engaged that pair nearing midstretch, and wore those
same rivals down under steady handling. MASTER OF ARMS moved up inside, dueled into the bend, continued to alternate for the advantage through the
bend and into the stretch, exchanged bumps with VOBISCUM a furlong out, outfinished that one for the runner up position while unable to match the winner
late. VOBISCUM made an early advance from between horses to contest the issue early, dueled turn off the inside, exchanged bumps with the runner up
while between horses with a furlong to run, outkicked for the second spot late. ST ANDREWS settled off the pace and the inside, lacked a closing response.
PISTOL OR SHOTGUN evenly paced, went three wide through the turn, lacked a closing response as well. OTTOMAN EMPIRE moved inside to race in the
two path into and through the turn, also failed to muster a rally. TOUCH CODE fell back to trail after the start, continued to see all his rivals through the turn,
picked off a couple of weakening foes after the issue had been decided. RUM 'N TONIC was finished early while four wide through much of the turn.
BIGTIME TEGRIDY off step slow, was also finished before four furlongs.

Footnotes
UNCLE RAY steered in soon after the start after breaking in good order, prompted the leader under confident handling turn, long drive, bid midstretch, fully
extended. GOLDEN BANDIT broke in to help tighten up inner rivals, cleared soon after, set the pace in hand turn while in the two path, responded when
confronted by the winner nearing the furlong grounds, proved stubborn to the end. KING DOODLE broke out, raced well behind the pace while out in the
strip into the turn, came five wide for the drive when moving closer, continued to close the gap on the top pair the final furlong. MENDELSSOHN JOY
pinched back at the start to be last away, continued well back while saving ground through the turn, steered out in midstretch and finished willingly to
improve position, gaining for the show spot. ALL IN GOOD TIME broke in then was bothered soon after, dropped inside, went evenly in lacking a closing
kick. EL GEMAR steadied when bothered soon after the start, raced outside, three to four wide turn, one paced through the lane to also lack a closing
response. PERIPATETIC broke out then was forced to take up soon after, raced back while in the two path, failed to rally. MOON OVER DUBAI floated out
at the start, came up empty for the drive. PIKACHU was outrun while racing four wide throughout.

Footnotes
COASTAL CHARM prompted the leader while in the three path, closer then took over late in the final turn, shook well clear a furlong out then held the
runner up safe late. LET'S DUET void of early foot, continued well back into the far turn, raced in the two path when beginning to advance through late turn,
continued to close the gap on the winner while too late at the end. BRITTLE AND YOO in the second flight while between horses, remained within striking
distance in the run up the backstretch, three wide turning for home when moving slightly closer, lost contact with the winner nearing midstretch, was slowly
getting back to that one while being caught for the place late. LADY COMMANDER in the second group while racing outside, bit closer in the four path
turning into the stretch, lacked a closing punch to finish up evenly. SQUILLIONS broke a step slow, moved out and was four wide out of the first turn,
dropped in, saved some ground second bend, improved slightly while not a serious threat. I FEEL THE NEED broke back, lacked speed, three wide through
the final turn, lacked a rally through the stretch. CHILLAXIFICATION broke on top, showed the way into the first turn, continued to set the pace in the two
path, faltered when headed late in the final bend. BYZANTINE forwardly placed while along the inside, stopped when headed late in the second turn.

SILK TRADE close from the start, continued to chase in the run up the backstretch, challenged from between foes far turn, put a head in front soon after,
edged clear when straightened for home, maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling. RED KNOBS back off the pace while off the inside, asked
along late in the final turn, angled four wide into the lane, making a mild rain on the winner while widest of the first flight at the wire, determined for the place.
SILVER DUST forwardly placed while outside, ranged up three wide to challenge outside the winner midway on the final turn, could not match strides with
that one through the lane, outkicked late for the second spot. MOJO MAN broke on top, cleared toward the inside into the first turn, continued to show the
way up the backstretch, faltered when headed in the final turn. SHADOW MATTER went one paced while racing just off the inside. WINDCRACKER
unprepared just prior to the start, detained briefly by an assistant starter as the gate opened, remained back throughout in lacking a rally. TWO BY TWO
broke back, trailed throughout and was never a factor. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, WINDCRACKER WAS
DECLARED A NON STARTER.

Footnotes
CONSPIRACY FACT in the second flight while in hand, moved closer in traffic late in the second turn, came in the two path for the drive, challenged past
the furlong marker, kicked well clear late. QUICK TO BLAME within striking distance outside and three wide, continued to race forwardly the middle half,
continued three wide into the lane, proved no match for the winner, edging clear for the place. MIDNIGHT MAJESTY away in good order, set the pace along
the inside, continued to show the way up the backstretch while saving ground, offered brief resistance to the top two when challenged second turn, steadily
weakened through the stretch but managed to save the show. MINT allowed the pace to go early while three wide through the first turn, raced in the two
path when going evenly through the second bend, displayed a mild amount of late interest while continuing just off the inside. FAMILY TRADITION broke in,
bumped with QUALITY RUN, was straightened to race in mid pack toward the inside, steered out three wide turning for home, went evenly to the wire while
improving position slightly. ROUNDER settled in the main body while just off the inside, went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response.
SCHMOOZE pressured the leader for six furlongs to that one's outside, gave way in the drive. MYSTIFIER broke in, made little impact in remaining back.
PAID IN FULL void of early foot off the inside, came four wide out of the final turn, failed to rally. QUALITY RUN off slow and was bumped at the break, well
back early, not involved. NAMESAKE off a step slow, backed up throughout.

Footnotes
EDGE TO EDGE broke alertly, cleared in the two path soon after, was pressed by the second flight through the turn while remaining off the rail, crept clear
nearing midstretch and held the runner up safe late to the wire. C Z ROCKET forwardly placed while off the inside, remained in striking position three wide
through the turn, fell back off the winner upper stretch and could do little else with that one to the wire while holding sway for the second spot. NECKER
ISLAND followed the winner in the two path, continued directly behind that one into the stretch, went evenly through the lane. MORELLO hesitated at the
break to spot the field a couple of lengths, used a bit as he moved up inside to a forward position, continued to save ground turn, had little for the drive.

Footnotes
CHUPAPI MUNYAYO in mid pack early, made a good gain along the inside late in the turn, tipped out in the two path for the drive collared the leader soon
after, well clear under token encouragement to win ridden out. IKE WAZOWSKI away well, dueled up front in the two path, shook clear midway on the bend,
proved no match for the winner, narrowly managed to save the place. RUDIANO back off the pace while well wide, four path into the turn, three wide exiting,
rallied down the stretch and while not a threat to winner, finished willingly to just miss the second spot. THIRD WATCH in the main body while out in the
strip, five wide into the turn, four wide exiting when moving a bit closer, flattened out in the drive, not enough for the place late. EMPYREAL SHADOW
jostled at the break, lacked speed, continued back off the pace turn while moving out three wide by late in the turn, improved slightly down the lane while not
posing a serious threat. MADMARTIGAN last to leave, dropped inside for the turn, improved position with some belated interest while also not a serious
menace. K J'S LEGACY in the second flight for three furlongs three wide, two path exiting the turn, had little left for the stretch run. LAKE HAMILTON also in
the second group while between horses, fell back in some traffic midway on the bend, went evenly when clear for the drive. READY SHOES lacked speed,
four wide into the turn, floated five wide exiting, remained back through the stretch in lacking a response. CADILLAC COWBOY broke out, bumped with
EMPYREAL SHADOW, was quickly righted to move up and duel inside, fell back off the other speed late in the turn, moved out a bit for the drive and
continued to weaken. OUTLAW RUN bumped at the start, never menaced. TRAFFIC BOSS bothered in the early going in traffic, was finished before a half
and trailed home.
