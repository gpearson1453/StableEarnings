COACH KENNY stalked outside of the leading pair, inched closer to them in midstretch with his head cocked right, bid in the final sixteenth, and edged an
advantage late. HALF AGAIN pressed outside of the leader, failed to gain even terms through midstretch, vied entering the final sixteenth as an outer rival
produced a bid, and got outkicked late. GRAVY HOUND set the pace inside of a pressing rival, maintained an advantage through midstretch while hanging
on his left lead, but was bested by a pair of outer rivals in the final sixteenth. GOLDEN PALACE laid off of the pace in the three to four paths around the
turn, then chased evenly. FLASHY BREW broke a beat slow, tracked along the inside, but faded. MISTER DON was off a step slow, and outrun throughout.

Footnotes
MIKE J broke well, set the pace, was challenged by SPANKHURST at the half mile pole, cleared that one before being challenged by two other rivals
around the turn, repelled those foes in upper stretch, and was kept to task to last for the win. ALL WEST broke well, pursued outside of rivals and from the
four path along the backside, was joined by foes in the turn, challenged the leader around the turn, dueled through the final furlong, and just missed but was
clearly second best. EMERALD FOREST was in contention between horses early, shuffled behind leaders slightly at the nine sixteenths pole, waited for
room in the second tier, split rivals three wide into the turn to challenge at the five sixteenths pole, was drifting out into a foe while battling through
midstretch, and couldn't get to the leader, but was game for third. SPANKHURST broke outwardly while off a step slow, rushed up along the inside to
challenge the leader at the half mile pole, dropped back nearing the three furlong pole, was strongly encouraged in hopes of splitting rivals in the lane, but
lacked a bid. FIREWATER JAKE trailed throughout.

HEI HEI CUSTIVITY stalked outside of the embattled leading pair around the turn, bid under a drive entering the lane, gained an advantage at the three
sixteenths pole while hanging on her left lead, inched clear after changing over at the furlong grounds, then lasted from an outer on-charging rival late.
VIOLA STAR broke slowly, lagged behind into the turn, gained along the fence turning for home, shifted ground to the five path in upper stretch, drifted to
the seven path while gaining in midstretch, then rallied in hopes of reeling in the clear leader late, but just ran out of ground. WUPKAR dueled for the lead
along the inside, disposed of her counterpart entering the lane as an outer HEI HEI CUSTIVITY loomed a danger, got headed by that one at the three
sixteenths pole, fought on through midstretch, but gave way in the final sixteenth. SUMITUP dueled for the lead two wide, but yielded between horses
leaving the quarter pole, and tired. SKY HIGH SUSAN lacked speed in the two path, and got outrun.

took brushes from rivals on either side at the start, set a clear pace, met GHOSTLY GIRL's bid entering the lane, got headed in upper stretch, and remained
well clear of show. ROLL GYPSY ROLL laid off of the pace in the three to four paths, then stayed on outside of rivals while hanging on her left lead, and
gained show late. PRIZE DEBATE tracked along the inside, chased in upper stretch, vied for show through midstretch, but was outkicked late. WAIT ON ME
tracked in midpack in the three path, vied for show in upper stretch, but tired between horses at the furlong grounds. BABY YOUR PERFECT raced at the
rear along the inside, and was outrun before being eased through the lane. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THIS RACE WAS ORIGINALLY

Footnotes
THE RAGE OF ART stalked three wide, bid turning for home while under a drive sparking a duel with an inner ZIPPIN PIPPIN, inched a narrow advantage
at the three sixteenths pole, sustained that short margin into deep stretch, and just held via a head-bob. ZIPPIN PIPPIN vied for the lead two wide, led at the
three furlong pole, resisted THE RAGE OF ART's bid at the five sixteenths marker, battled gamely after being slightly headed at the three sixteenths pole,
regained even terms in the final sixteenth, but lost the nod on the wire. CATHERINE BLAZE lagged behind the rest around the turn, cut the gap in upper
stretch, altered course outwardly at the three sixteenths pole, rallied between horses, shifted inside of the embattled leading pair inside the final furlong with
multiple lengths to find, and offered a belated charge. STOP THE MADNESS stalked two wide and between horses, came into the lane in the four path,
drifted to the six path while hanging on her left lead nearing midstretch, and yielded. UNBRIDLED ANNSLEY broke half a beat slow, tracked along the
inside, surpassed an inner rival while failing to keep pace with the leaders entering the lane, and failed to menace. KEEP LEFT set the pace inside of a
vying rival into the turn, but was headed at the three furlong pole, and caved in hand through the lane.

Footnotes
KYLE BEAUTY set the pace outside of a prompting rival and from the four path down the backstretch, cleared before tucking to the two path entering the
turn, maintained a clear margin under confident handling through midstretch, then felt a light shoulder tap to keep on task entering the final sixteenth.
MICHELLES LIL STAR brushed with an inner rival shortly after the start, stalked three wide, gained place turning for home, sparred with an inner rival for
that position through the lane, and prevailed. A RUNNIN AFLEET prompted the pace along the inside of the eventual winner early on, failed to keep pace
into the turn, chased around the bend, battled for place inside of a foe through the lane, but was bested. NODAH broke slowly, but avoided tight quarters
among foes by doing so, pursued from off of the pace in the four path, and failed to threaten the top trio through the lane. DIXIE FARMER tracked in the two
path, failed to sustain midpack position along the inside around the turn, shifted out to the three path in upper stretch, and failed to factor between horses.
HOPEITSMYLUCKYDAY was urged along while lacking speed along the inside, and never got involved. CAJUN NINJA steadied when put to tight quarters
between horses in the opening stages, trailed in the three path around the turn, came into the lane in the five path, and made little impact.
DON'TCALLMEPATSY came out and put an outer rival to tight quarters soon after the start, stalked two wide and between horses, but weakened entering
the lane.

Footnotes
BELEOUT pressed two wide, vied in the three path around the turn, led turning for home, drove clear in upper stretch, dug in to resist BASALT STREET's
outer bid in the final furlong, and held to the wire. BASALT STREET stalked along the inside, shifted three wide and between horses leaving the quarter
pole, took aim on the clear leader in upper stretch, grinded away in the final furlong to bid in the final sixteenth, but was fended off. CARNELIAN tracked the
top pair from the four path around the turn, got outkicked by an inner rival in upper stretch, yet kept on to prove best of the rest. ROMANCE NOVEL laid off
of the pace in the two path, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, and ran on for a minor share. HIGH SPEED saved ground towards the rear around the
turn, then improved position. PALACEIN set the pace, showed the way inside of the eventual winner while a bit off of the rail into the turn, but was headed at
the five sixteenths pole, and weakened in upper stretch. MISS DISTINCTIVE stumbled at the start and bumped with an outer rival in the aftermath, raced at
the rear two wide, and made little impact. SHANIAH exchanged bumps with an inner rival in the opening stages, lacked speed in the four to five paths
around the turn, and gave way.

Footnotes
HIDDEN ENEMY (IRE) tracked along the inside, bid for the lead in the four path and between horses around the far turn, got herded out to the eight path by
an inner foe while vying in upper stretch, dueled in the nine path in the final furlong, and prevailed. C FALLS opened up in the two path, met a pair of outer
bids around the far turn, drifted out to the six path while sparring with them through upper stretch lugged further out in the final furlong, and was bested.
COURAGEOUSLY tracked three wide, gained in the five around the far turn before fanning to the ten path entering the lane, grinded to striking range in the
outer part of the course in midstretch, but flattened out. MONARCH MAN laid off of the pace along the inside, tracked from the three path around the far
turn, chased behind the leaders from the six to eight path in upper stretch, shifted inside of the leading luggers at the furlong ground, but leveled off.
UNLEASH THE POWER stalked in the two path, but failed to sustain position down the backstretch while being surpassed by rivals on either side, then
yielded once again between other horses into the far turn, yet sustained a chase through the lane. SUPER WISE lacked speed in the three to four paths,
chased in eight to nine paths in upper stretch, and lacked a bid. BRIGHT SPARK raced far back in the two path, and failed to factor while hanging on his left
lead. WIN WORTHY dwelt at the start, lagged well behind the rest around both turns, and cut the gap late.

Footnotes
MY ROYAL PRINCESS tracked five wide, grinded away through midstretch to bid entering the final sixteenth, and forged an advantage late. ANSLIE'S
GUMDROP stalked four wide, bid between horses at the furlong grounds, led entering the final sixteenth, but was outkicked late. MADISON'S SCREEN was
forced inwardly before being pinched between horses at the start, lacked speed in the three path and between horses, fanned to the eight path in upper
stretch, and moved up late. BEANIE stalked along the inside, bid for the lead along the rail in midstretch, but flattened out. AVIE J came in at the start,
tracked two wide and between horses, took aim three wide entering the lane, bid among foes in midstretch, but yielded. ISN'T IT TIME saved ground off of
the pace, but to no avail. CONTINENTAL RED set the pace in the two path, drew clear turning for home, but met bids on either side in midstretch, and
faded. BLESS D'SOUTH trailed and never got involved. GOOD GIRL SHORTY pressed outside of the leader and from the three path, chased turning for
home, then weakened between horses entering the lane. SUM CHARM broke a step slowly, and was outrun in the six path.
