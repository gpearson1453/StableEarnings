Footnotes
URBAN MYTH settled off the pace while racing along the rail, advanced inside around the far turn, closed at the rail, took the lead near the sixteenth pole,
dueled inside of LUNA WARRIOR from there and prevailed. LUNA WARRIOR settled off the pace inside, angled out on the backstretch, bid three wide
around the far turn, took the lead near the quarter pole, put away the pace rivals in upper stretch, was collared by the winner near the sixteenth pole and
fought on outside of that foe to the wire. BLIND EYE was in a bit tight at the start, raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch, rallied
outside, switched back to the left lead near the sixteenth pole and kept gaining. GRANDE SOIREE stalked the pace in the clear two wide for five furlongs,
bid between foes near the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. TOYI set a fast pace in the two path and gave way near the quarter pole. KAREN'S
REVENGE saved ground off the pace, steadied late on the first turn, went two wide around the far turn and never threatened. DEN STREET trailed inside.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT GETAWAY stalked in the four path into the turn, was cuedd from said position passing the quarter pole and tipped out to the six path into the
stretch, bid in upper stretch and took the lead into the final furlong while tipping slightly inward, and drew clear. RED GUN brushed with an inner foe leaving
the gate, chased from the two path into the turn, was coaxed passing the quarter pole and angled out to the seven path into the lane, and chased home the
winner for place. BLUE LIEUTENANT prompted the pacesetter in the three path, bid around the turn and took a narrow lead while in the four path entering
the lane, but was overtaken by the eventual winner nearing the eighth pole, and evened out in the final furlong for show. LUSCIOUS DANCER tracked in the
five path, received a left handed cue from said position midway around the turn and was urged while floating out to the seven path into the stretch, but was
one paced. EXPLOSIVE WAVE brushed with an outer foe at the start, trailed along the inside and tipped out to the three path into the turn, but never
threatened while going wide into the stretch. FROSTEDBIRD set the pace in the two path, shifted in to the rail around the turn and was roused when headed
nearing the quarter, but yielded in the the two path approaching the eighth pole.

Footnotes
CRICKET WEST stalked the pace in the three path, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, quickly cleared and held clear while ridden out. KUKARO raced
off the pace three and four wide and rallied outside to gain the place late. HOLY BERRIES tracked the pace two wide between foes, could not match strides
with the winner around the far turn and was one-paced in the lane to hold third. SIDNEY SUE saved ground in range, lacked the needed rally, collapsed on
the gallop out and was vanned off. CHALLENGE PRINCESS failed to menace while racing three and four wide. WHAT KNOT bumped at the start, raced in
range four wide and faded through the lane. GAM GAM JOANN set the pace in the two path, gave way near the five-sixteenths pole and was vanned off.
HARDSPUN WOMAN broke slowly and was bumped at the start then trailed inside.

READY FOR DIAMONDS trailed in the two path around the first turn and was in the three path down the backstretch, tipped out to the five path and was
roused while ranging up around the far turn, took aim and received a right handed cued in the six path at the top of the lane, rallied thru the lane, was up in
the final sixteenth, and drew clear. TIO TONY rated along the inside, tipped out to the five path around the far turn and floated out to the seven path under a
ride entering the lane, and ran on under left handed urging for place. O'CONNER SUNSET set the pace in the two path around the first turn before tipping
inside into the backstretch, floated out to the three path and was challenged by an outer foe at the top of the stretch, dug in until the eighth pole, and evened
out for show. RANSEUR had his head turned at the start, raced prominently in the four path, made a bid to the outside of the pacesetter turning into the
stretch, but hung and flattened in the final furlong. ROCK THE WEEKEND tracked along the inside, was cued right handed and driven in the two path into
the far turn, but faded going into the stretch. GLENHOLME was in tight and had to steady into the first turn, then checked out to the four path just after,
stalked from the down the backstretch, was urged in the five path into the lane, but was tired. WAVE ACTION steadied between rivals early around the first
turn, was prompted along between rivals in the two path down the backstretch, but never menaced.

the pace in the three path, took the lead in upper stretch and battled on between foes to save the place. HARRY'S ONTHEFLY was up close inside,
steadied entering the turn, saved ground around the bend and rallied along the rail in the stretch. LAWFUL raced off the pace three wide, angled six wide in
upper stretch and rallied belatedly. MONET NEVER (IRE) set a pressured pace in the two path and weakened in the final furlong. COOLER KING chased
the pace two wide and faded in the lane. ALL IN ALL failed to menace while racing three wide. MORE THAN LOOKS was off slowly, advanced four wide
around most of the turn, fanned seven wide turning for home and faded. PETCOFF broke slowly, raced two wide and played no factor. COSMIC

Footnotes
MADEMOISELLEJACKIE set a rated pace inside, kicked clear in upper stretch and held firm under a steady drive. DORAL saved ground in range, angled
three wide turning for home, rallied outside but was fended off late. I'M A SURE THING saved ground off the pace, bid at the rail in upper stretch but evened
out a bit in the final furlong. SKYVIEW DRIVE raced off the pace two wide between foes, went four wide around the far turn, was forced six wide turning for
home and lacked the needed stretch rally. POR UNA CABEZA raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide in midstretch and improved position. BOMBA
NERA pressed the winner two wide to midstretch and weakened. WAY TOO EARLY prompted the pace three wide and faded in the lane. SHIRL'S
DELIGHT bobbled after the start, trailed inside early, went three wide around the far turn, checked near the quarter pole and was easing through the lane.

Footnotes
DIAMOND WOW bumped with an outer foe at the start and raced off the pace along the inside, was roused in the two path around the turn and angled out
to the six path into the lane, rallied to bid in upper stretch and quickly took the lead entering the final furlong, and drew clear. RESTOFTHESTORY prompted
the pace in the three path, bid in the four path around the turn and took the lead in the three path into the stretch, was overtaken by the outer winner
entering the final furlong, but dug in to hold place. RADIO DAYS tracked in the four path, shifted to the three path and was cued rounding the turn, was
stymied nearing the quarter pole and tipped into the two path entering the lane, and kept on but hung late for show. STARSHIP NALA had an awkward slow
start and trailed in the five path, was driven in the seven path turning into the stretch, and finished evenly down the center. JAG WARRIOR stalked in the
four path but flattened in the final furlong. MUSIC CITY STAR bumped with an inner foe at the start but recovered well to set the pace in the two path, was
challenged by an outer foe and lost the lead turning into the stretch, and had to steady along the inside in upper stretch, while giving way.

Footnotes
KANTHARI stalked the pace two wide between foes, angled to the rail in midstretch, closed gamely through a tight spot inside of the pacesetter and was up
in the final stridest. BIZ BIZ BUZZ settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch, rallied between foes and was just up for the
place. HOPE IN HIM set a clear pace in the two path, shifted to the rail in upper stretch, drifted back out into the two path under intermittent left-handed
urging, was under a hard right rein while appearing to get in a bit late and was nailed on both sides. AXTHELM raced off the pace three wide, angled five
wide in upper stretch and rallied outside. DETROIT CITY prompted the pace in the three path and was one-paced between foes in the lane. DR. DUKE had
early speed inside and steadily faded. RUTHLESS INTENT was in a bit tight at the start, dropped far back soon after and trailed throughout.

GLIDING AFLEET stalked in the two path around the first turn and was in the three path down the backstretch, was roused to bid from said position nearing
the quarter pole and took command in the five path at the top of the lane, lugged in after a right handed cue while opening up into the final furlong and drew
clear. DONTKISSDAMINISTER got bumped by an inner foe after the start, tracked in the four path, was coaxed in the five path around the far turn and
urged left handed while angling out the seven path going into the stretch, and ran on down the center to nail the pacesetter on the wire for place. BLUE
SOLDIER set the pace while shifting inside around the first turn and was in the two path down the backstretch, was roused from the rail around the far turn
and floated out to the four path under a drive into the stretch, yielded to the winner in upper stretch, evened out inside the final furlong, and was caught on
the wire to lose a photo with an outer foe to finish with show honors. W. P. CADET was keen while up close in the four path early, was cued to bid while
shifting in to the two path around the far turn, but flattened in the stretch. ANTILLEAN brushed with an inner foe at the start, bumped twice between foes just
