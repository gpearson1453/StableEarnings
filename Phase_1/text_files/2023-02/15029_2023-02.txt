WADSWORTH awkward start, unhurried, rallied far turn, drew clear ridden out. SCOOBIE QUANDO reluctant to load, unhurried to the half, rallied 4wd
stretch run. MIRANDA RIGHTS steadied along inside first turn, troubled trip on wrong lead in the stretch run as well. CLEAR THE AIR inside trip behind
dueling leaders, shuffled back far turn but rerallied and, came on in late stretch. FIRST STRIKE squeezed start, far back early, flying on wide far turn, moved
up. PHANTOM RIDE no speed to far turn, shut off stretch altered course, no gain. SATURN BOY three wide run to far turn, bid past quarter pole, flattened
out. MENDEL'S SECRET inside duel to far turn, used up and faded in the stretch run. HUNTERTOWN saved ground to the half with a steady fade from that
point. STORM DADDY dueled from two path for a half, gave way readily.

Footnotes
SEVEN AND SEVEN speed to the front, galloped around unabated throughout and stayed clear under good handling. RAL COPPERHEADROAD chased
winner throughout, never challenged and settled for the place spot. MONEY PIT chased top pair throughout with no late response when asked. OVER
PROTECTIVE off rail trip while evenly throughout with no late run in stretch. MAQAMAT never in contention. RIGHT OF RUSH rowdy in the gate, through
early with no response when needed. VASILEVSKIY (IRE) bothered at the start, slow into stride never a factor. THISPOINTINTIME stayed close to the half,
faded back going into far turn. DOWN TO BIZZNESS bore out start, bumped rival, never factored thereafter. FATHER PATRICK always trailed.
