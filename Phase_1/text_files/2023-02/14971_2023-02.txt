Footnotes
BIG FRANK trailed through the clubhouse turn, advanced steadily outside rivals, rallied determinedly three wide under right handed urging in deep stretch
and got up in the final strides. MY BROTHER CAM rushed to the lead four wide before the first turn, set all the pace then couldn't handle the late charge of
the winner. A LATE ONE vied for the lead from the start, drew closer to the leader two wide nearing the quarter pole, angled inside the pacesetter past the
furlong marker then was outfinished. NIGHT TIME RULER chased the pace into the stretch then weakened late. VALHALLA AIR BASE within striking
distance from the start, gave way in the stretch.

LILAC LACE chased the pace into the stretch, surged under left handed urging through deep stretch two wide and was along in time. ORBALINE broke in
front, set all the pace then couldn't handle the winner. ORBITING THE SKY vied for the lead three wide and finished determinedly. HER GOLD MINE failed
to menace. FLYING BUSINESS checked nearing the nine sixteenths pole when SHAK'S HIDDEN GEM shifted out, moved up in the turn then leveled off.
LEADING INDICATOR rushed to contention along the inside, had speed into the turn then was used up. CYBERBURG was outrun. SHAK'S HIDDEN GEM
angled out near the nine sixteenths pole, raced wide from there and was no factor.

JUSTINSPEIGHTOFIT broke alertly, set all the pace, opened a daylight advantage on the turn and lasted under right handed urging. THE COACHMAN
chased the winner and was steadily cutting into that one's advantage late in the four then five paths. SOUPER PRONTO trailed into the stretch then closed
rapidly in the two path for a minor share. COAL TOWN ROAD chased the winner three wide, dropped inside in the stretch and was outfinished. THE
EQUINEST failed to menace. SUNNY BEAST went evenly. WHEN IN ROME chased the winner four then two wide and was through after a half. MR.
LUCKY had good early speed between horses then faded. ON SPOT was through early.

Footnotes
MASAI MAN never far back, responded with a burst of speed five wide and got up in the final strides. MONTAUK COVE with the second flight inside, surged
late three then two wide and just missed. ELLE'SBIGSEACRET dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch, shook clear before the furlong marker and was
caught in the final stages. FRONTLINER broke a step slow, trailed into the turn, shifted six wide then closed ground rapidly through the deep stretch. MAS
CHIKILIN dueled for the lead along the inside into the stretch and faded late. D'MONEY HONEY chased the leader three then four wide and lacked the
needed response. CLAW failed to menace. LIMIT UP never far back, moved up a bit near the inside on the turn, shifted out three wide then leveled off.
FAHRENHEIT was no factor. SLIPPY was outrun.

three wide. PERFECT PICTURE chased the pace along the inside into the stretch then was outfinished. HONKY TONK MUSIC vied for the lead between

DECEITFUL ANTHONY chased the pace into the stretch, drew on even terms for the lead two wide before the furlong marker, matched strides under left
handed urging through the final furlong and proved best in a game effort LAUDA SPEED stalked the pace for a half, rallied thee wide to gain a narrow
advantage near the furlong marker and just missed hanging on. READY TO MARCH sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace into the stretch then
weakened late. STARSHIP TAXI settled in the four path and went evenly. TAMANRASSETT failed to menace. ALL STAR JUSTICE was no factor.
DIAMONDS ENJOY had brief speed. OUT FOR JUSTICE was outrun.

ENCHANTEDLY had speed from the start pressing the pace along the inside through the clubhouse turn, made the lead before a half, set the balance of the
pace and widened through the stretch to win as much the best while taken in hand late. UNESCORTED never far back, rallied along the inside into the
stretch and finished second best. CHORIST never far back, finished with good courage three wide. WILDCAT DREAM stalked the pace for six furlongs,
offered a bid three then two wide into the stretch then came up empty. CURIOSITY KILLS set the early pace two wide, kept pressure into the stretch then
weakened. LOVE'S TAVITO failed to menace. ONLY SHOW IN TOWN was no threat. NELL'S BELLS trailed.
