GENERAL ROBINSON led the way while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far bend and drew off
in the lane. BANK BUSTER saved ground early, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, offered a bid from the two path coming around the
second turn, could not go with the winner in the stretch and kept on to the finish. CAYMAN QUEEN raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the
pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and gained ground in late stretch. DUDEFOOLINGDARLING
saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path and improved position
late. MARVELOUS LADY raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the second
bend, raced into mild traffic in upper stretch and flattened out from there. WICKLOW GAL saved ground at the back of the pack through the opening half
mile, moved up on the field while racing in the five path around the far turn and never threatened. WIFEY MATERIAL saved ground around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, saved ground around the second turn and faded in the lane. VALIANT MISTRESS
raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the four path and tired in the
stretch. THE RIDER OF HORSE SEVEN, MARVELOUS LADY, FILED AN OBJECTION CITING INTERFERENCE FROM HORSE SIX, BANK BUSTER AT

bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, raced in the three path early, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the far
turn still in the three path and was empty in the lane. COPAZO raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, came around
the far bend in the four path and made no bid. RED OCTOBER raced at the back of the pack between horses around the first bend and up the backstretch,
navigated the far turn from the two path and made no bid. THE BEARRISH ONE raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the leaders on the
outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and tired in the stretch. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

LETS TAKE IT IZZY pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the three path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and
drew off to the wire. WHISKARITA raced in the middle of the pack between horses early, came around the bend in the three path and chased the winner
home in the stretch. MAMBO DANCER led the way on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn, could not go with the
eventual winner in the stretch and kept on to the finish. FLATOUTANDFOXY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a
mile, navigated the turn from the four path and improved position in the lane, narrowly missing second place. AUBURN tracked the leader on the inside up
the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faded in the stretch. DIXIELAND DANCER trailed the field throughout, saved ground around the bend
and was never a factor.

from the three path coming around the bend and dueled down the stretch, narrowly missing. PROPER MANNERS bumped with the horse to her inside
leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and gained ground
late. CURL TALK bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, recovered to lead the way up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the bend
and weakened between horses in the final furlong. APRIL MIST raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening stages, began a bid from
the four path coming around the bend and flattened out in the lane. JIM'S BRONZE STAR bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, trailed the field
up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and never threatened. BAND SWEETHEART bumped with the horse to her outside at the break,
settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path and made no bid. SOLID TUNE raced off the pace between horses
early, was forced to steady when running in tight quarters headed into the turn, raced in the two and three path from there and was empty in the lane.

around the turn and never fired.
