JUSTA SIMPLE GIRL between horses to the front, stayed clear under strong hand urging in a good effort. TIZ SUSAN ANN no early speed inside, bottled
up into the turn turn, angled out past quarter pole to finish up strongly late for the place spot. FUTURE FLAY never far back to turn, wide run past quarter
pole but outkicked for the place spot. SUPER LUCY no speed to turn outside finished well for a minor share. FOOT RUB LOVE rushed outside to press
