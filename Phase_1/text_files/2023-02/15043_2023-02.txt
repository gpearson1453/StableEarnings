Footnotes
GOOD IDEA away alertly, prompted the pace along the rail for a half, assumed command, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch to
win easily. BEYOND MY DREAMS vied for the lead three wide and was no match for the winner. MASTER OF WAR allowed to settle, passed tiring rivals
through the stretch in the five path. HONORABLE stumbled at the start, sped to the lead in the three path on the first turn, set the pace for a little over a half
mile in the two path, remained a sharp threat into the stretch then weakened. PHARAOH'S PROPHECY had speed four wide and weakened on the far turn.
DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS ORIGINALLY HAND TIMED. FINAL CHANGED AND FRACTIONS PROVIDED UPON REVIEW.

LADY FORTUNE with the second flight along the inside, shifted out midway on the turn, rallied determinedly under left handed urging while drifting out and
was along in time. EXACTITUDE stalked the pace three wide in the five path into the turn, rallied to make the lead at the top of the stretch, dropped inside,
drew clear before the furlong marker then couldn't handle the winner. PATTI LOU allowed to settle, had a mild rally late in the four path. SHADY BABY away
alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside to the top of the stretch then weakened in the final furlong. BEAUTIFUL VICTORIA failed to menace.
BUSYBEING FABULOUS battled for the lead two wide for nearly a half then gave way in the stretch. ALL THE BEST was outrun. SKIPSHOT LILLY was
