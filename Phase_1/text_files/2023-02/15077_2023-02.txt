Footnotes
TATE stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled the turn three deep, bid for the lead outside FILIPPO in upper stretch, dueled with that one and
narrowly prevailed. FILIPPO saved ground around the turn, drifted out turning for home, dueled inside the winner through the stretch and dug in tenaciously
to just miss. ROMP unhurried down the backstretch, navigated the turn in the two path, moved to the inner rail at the head of the stretch, had aim on the
lead in mid stretch and hung. AUSPICIOUS LAD prompted the pace outside FILIPPO around the turn and gave way in upper stretch. ONLY CHILD hugged
the inner rail around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
SHACKLEFORD COUNTY broke a step slow, recovered and accelerated inside rivals to take command, set a pressured pace while removed from the rail,
was guided to about the three path dueling into the lane, ceded command to DULCE KIARA past the three sixteenths, wandered outward while battling on
under right handed asks, retook the lead with a sixteenth to go, continued to wander and held firm. DULCE KIARA prompted the pace outside
SHACKELFORD COUNTY, applied more pressure leaving the five sixteenths, move to a slim lead heading towards mid stretch, dueled while drifting out
and hung late. DANCER'S MELODY stalked the embattled leaders while four wide, ranged up to loom into the lane, shifted out a bit wider to pursue but
went evenly through the final furlong. GOLD TIME VIXEN , nudged on early while off the rail, took closer order four to five wide approaching the stretch but
failed to kick on from there. ADHWAA , off the pace, angled five to six wide in upper stretch, altered back in for the final furlong and offered a mild kick.
EVER SO D'WILD rated close up early while saving ground, was pushed along past the three eighths, failed to go on nearing the lane and faltered.

Footnotes
KILBRITTAIN'S RED cleared early and set a rated pace, moved away past the five sixteenths, opened up when set down three wide in upper stretch, kept
on under stout asking leaving the furlong marker then held firm while geared down a bit very late. CHERU broke a step slow, was sent up to the inside of
rivals nearing the turn, eased out with pursuit into the lane and kept on willingly to steadily bridge the gap. REPPAZZ angled out early and stalked the
winner, took closer order near the three eighths, drifted out a bit when failing to keep pace nearing the lane, straightened then lacked a serious punch while
under some hand urging late. DIAMOND SUE , three wide between foes, steadied leaving the five sixteenths, shifted in and churned on. ZIPPY DO DA DAY
, urged from the gate, lost ground four to five wide, raced a bit green in upper stretch and failed to mount a rally.

Footnotes
FUHGEDDABOUDIT stalked the pace, four deep around the turn, advanced through the stretch, gained the lead between horses approaching the finish and
narrowly prevailed. SUMMER ODDS lacked speed, circled the turn four wide, floated to the six path entering the stretch and rallied outside the winner.
HALEIGH B saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, eased out to the three path entering the stretch, was well positioned in mid stretch and flattened
out. MOONSAFE , bumped by SPARKLE SPRINKLE leaving the starting gate, swung to the five path in upper stretch, worked between horses and rallied.
I'M GITTIN THERE stalked the pace around the turn, was well placed between horses in upper stretch and came up empty. BETCHA BY GOLLY lacked
speed, was well off the inner rail in mid stretch, angled to the inner rail near the sixteenth pole and failed to menace. SPARKLE SPRINKLE bumped
MOONSAFE when bearing in leaving the starting gate, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way final eighth of a mile. TARGE prompted the pace
outside SPARKLE SPRINKLE and gave way the final furlong.

Footnotes
UTTERLY ENCHANTING pressed four wide outside a rival, took command in upper stretch, moved clear in mid stretch then was fully extended to prevail.
MY BOSS LADY , between rivals leaving the far turn, dropped in to pursue, edged up leaving mid stretch, challenged inside the winner in deep stretch,
fought gamely but was kept at bay. MS. MALEVOLENCE , four wide early, moved up between runners near mid stretch, had her rider lose the whip soon
after, shifted out and churned on. FORTES sped to the front, set a pressured pace while well off the rail, ceded the lead in upper stretch, stayed on to about
mid stretch and weakened. NOTION INTERRUPTUS , off slowly and rank, lagged well back, came five wide for the drive and lacked a serious run.
SPECIAL FREEDOM failed to menace. NANCYSAIDSO urged chasing towards the rail, failed to keep pace leaving the five sixteenths and faltered.
