Footnotes
SABERMAN stalked the pace from four wide to the turn then mads a three wide bid at the quarter pole and gave a late surge to just get up. BEAUDEAN
went to the lead from under pressure early, pulled away on the turn and was headed at the top of the stretch then was out kicked. PRATHER was placed off
the pace on the inside but lacked a late response. WINNY'SSPECIALSTAR saved ground from near the back then made a rail bid on the turn but was
empty in the stretch. DONOVANS WARRIOR pressed the early pace and retreated. RUSSET MOON broke well, raced wide throughout and was not a
factor. MO HAWK MAN was not a threat.

Footnotes
TENSAS VIRGINIA was hustled away from the gate to be close up on the backstretch then moved out to the two path at the quarter pole and took
command at the top of the stretch and proved best. MAGGIE'S RETURN was void of the early speed racing six wide to the turn then moved in to three wide
around the turn and was a clear second. ALYS EPISODE had good early speed then was collared at the end of the bend and tired. CUSTOM GUITAR
raced in the middle of the pack on the inside and proved best of the rest. I'M ALL MIXED UP sprinted away from the gate to be off the pace early and
finished evenly. TRICKY MOM raced in the middle of the pack from three to four wide but was not a threat. LA SMOOCHIE bobbled at the start, raced four
to five wide and was outrun. FORT PIKE was never involved.

gave way. CALIFORNIA BELLE raced near the back around the first turn then moved up from three wide down the backstretch and faltered. TECHE

MOVE IT stalked the pace down the backstretch, made a bid at the quarter pole for a late rally and was just up. LAUGHINGSAINTSSONG sprinted to a
pressured lead then pulled away on the turn but was nailed. BAYOU BEAUX pressed the pace from the three path to the top of the stretch and fought
gamely to the wire. FLUFFPOINT was off the pace in the two path to the middle of the stretch and weakened late. POWERSHOT raced near the back early
then made a bid at the five sixteenths pole from three wide and flattened out. HALFMOON REEF was void of speed and passed tiring rivals. PAT ME
DOWN raced in the middle of the pack from the inside and gave way. CROQUE MONSIEUR (GB) saved ground to the turn then made a mild bid but was
not a factor. SPORTY FLYER raced in the middle of the pack from the three path but was not a threat.

Footnotes
LADY DREAMER took the lead at the end of the first bend, was pressured to the three sixteenths pole then pulled away to prove the best. SWEET ALEXIS
was five to six wide into the first turn then rushed up from three wide down the backstretch, kept on around the final turn but was no match for the winner
and was a clear second. HELLO MARYLOU had good brief early speed into the first turn then pressed the pace to the three sixteenths pole and weakened.
NUBILITY reared as the gates opened then hopped out of the starting gate, was allowed to settle around the first turn, gained ground down the backstretch
and went three wide at the three sixteenths pole to make a late run but only improved position. MISS LONELYHEARTS was forwardly placed in the two path
to the final turn then made a mild bid but failed to menace. LAST OF THE NILE had an inside trip but never made a bid. LYRICAL MUSIC stalked the pace
from two or three wide to the quarter pole and gave way. JU JU VIP raced near the back around the first turn the moved up down the backstretch and
retreated on the final turn. MISS ARKANSAS was always back.
