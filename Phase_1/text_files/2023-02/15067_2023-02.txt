Footnotes
EM'S WINAHOLIC was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and was up in the closing
yards to be going away late. MAMALONA was away in good order to stalk the pace of KEEPONROCKINMEBABY while racing three-wide, moved up to
engage that rival nearing the three-sixteenths marker, vied, gained a brief lead late but could not resist the winner from over the top.
KEEPONROCKINMEBABY sprinted clear soon after the start, responded when challenged by MAMALONA into the lane, vied with that foe and gave way
through the final sixteenth. DOWNTHESTREETDEBBY was off a step slow, rushed to contend, raced four-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive.
TED'S CANDY GIRL showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
CINNTE WINNTE (IRE) tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew clear. HEART
RIVER showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and was up for place. TICK TOCK stalked the leaders
while racing four-wide, stayed on well in the drive and finished willingly. CIDSTAYINURLAINE sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace
and gave way through the final furlong. LEXOPHILIA was forwardly placed early, raced off the rail through the second turn and gave way in the drive.
MISTY MATT bobbled at the start, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not menace. TWITTERATI was void of early speed,
raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
SPEEDY GIGI was away in good order to duel for the lead with J T'S LA NENA while racing three-wide, opened a clear lead nearing the quarter, increased
that advantage and held by a diminishing margin. WILD ARCH was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, rallied late and
was gaining on the winner. TAKING CHARGE DESI showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. DREAMER
GIRL was forwardly placed early, checked nearing the nine-sixteenths pole, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly. V BUCKS lacked early
foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. J T'S LA NENA broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside and weakened after going a
half.

KEBA LUCKY DAY was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with CURIOUS INJI while racing three-wide, vied with that rival into mid-stretch,
opened a clear lead and held that foe off while being fully extended. CURIOUS INJI broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner while racing four-wide,
drifted out into the land and came back to finish with good late energy. PLUMA settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and rallied late.
YELLEN was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. LADY JADE lacked early speed, raced
three-wide through the turn and failed to menace. KID CAT was off slow, lagged, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
THEE BOB'S ALL IN raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out further in mid-stretch, reached the fore with a sixteenth
to run and held off the closing OF GOOD REPORT to prevail. OF GOOD REPORT settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn
and finished with good energy. RIVER ROSE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached a striking position
but failed to gain late. JOKER MATT was away in good order to duel for the early lead with GALLANT OAK from the inside, opened a clear margin with a
furlong to run and gave way in the drive. CLUB MESQUITE settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and finished evenly in the drive. GALLANT
OAK broke sharply to dispute the pace with JOKER MATT while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and gave way through the
final furlong. STALKING SHADOW showed brief speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and weakened. MAHI MAHI was void of early speed,
saved ground through the second turn and did not threaten. N. K. ROCKET MAN raced four-wide through both turns, was never far back and weakened in
the drive. THE RACE WAS ORIGINALLY HAND TIMED, TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.
