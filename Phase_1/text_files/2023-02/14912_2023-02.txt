CALL ME COLLECT tracked the leader and took the lead at the quarter pole then drew off. CHELSEA'S GLORY chased the leaders from three wide and
proved second best. CUSTOM DANCER raced near the back down the backstretch then made a two wide bid at the five sixteenths pole for a late run but
was no match for the top two. GLITTER STORM was void of the early speed, made a four wide bid at the five sixteenths pole but couldn't gain on the
winner. FIGHTING SOLDIER saved ground to no avail. LAST NATIVE CAT was rushed to a clear lead to the quarter pole and tired, took a bad step at the
top of the stretch, fell, lost rider and was vanned off. STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING OF THE RACE, AFTER A REVIEW NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN.

Footnotes
MILA'S KAT tracked the leaders around the first turn then made a three wide bid at the three eighth pole to talk the lead at the quarter pole and dueled to
upper stretch was headed but came again and drew off. SHE'S TAKIN OVER was allowed to settle through the final turn then made a three to four wide late
rally to be up for the place. TALE OF TENSAS shot to a clear lead down the backstretch then was headed at the quarter pole, chased leaders home and
just held the show. KATIE'S C raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then moved out to four wide at the three eighths pole to duel around the
final turn, took a brief lead at the top of the stretch and tired. ST MARIA saved ground but did not make a bid. ABSOLUTELY MINDY raced near the back
around the first turn then made a middle move on the backstretch but lacked a later response for the drive. MOODY RAFAELA was hustled along early to
be placed off the pace around the first turn then tracked the leader to the quarter pole but was used up.

SUNSHINE sprinted to a clear lead but drifted out going into the turn and was out kicked in the stretch drive to be second best. MINT JULIUS hesitated and
hopped at the start then rallied from three to four wide to be the best of the rest. SERENGETI SIX raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then
made a rail bid on the turn to improve position. PIECE OF ME broke in and brushed CIRCLEOFSOUL at the start, dueled in the second flight to the three
eighths pole and gave way. SWAMP ROCK broke in at the start then raced on the rail but was not a factor. CIRCLEOFSOUL brushed with PIECE OF ME at
the start then veered out and raced wide throughout. VALERIE LOUISE broke in at the start then raced in the middle of the pack and retreated.

BIG ROJO stalked the pace from the three path then made a bid at the five sixteenths pole to gain on the leader then engaged leader in late stretch and
drew clear. WAITIN' ON A WOMAN was within striking distance on the inside around the first turn then slipped through going into the final turn and got up
for the place. MR LIBERTY was roused to a clear lead to the top of the stretch then was caught late while tiring. OXBOW WIND raced in the middle of the
pack down the backstretch then made a three to four wide bid at the quarter pole and flattened out around the final turn but made a rebid in the stretch to
make a late gain. DURITZ was unhurried down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the final turn and finished evenly. MY LITTLE JUNIOR had brief
early foot to the first turn then tracked the leader down the backstretch and retreated. CARRIES MAN veered in at the start then settled in the middle of the
pack while racing three to four wide but was never a threat.

Footnotes
HYPERBOLIST was placed off the pace in the three path around the first turn then was coaxed at the five sixteenths pole to take the lead after the quarter
pole, pulled away to prove much the best. COASTAL CHAOS was unhurried around the first turn while saving ground then slipped through opening at the
top of the stretch to be second best. THEO D'OR raced in the middle of the pack then moved out to three wide in upper stretch to make a run and was up
for the show. AFTERNOON ANEJO raced near the back around the first turn then moved between horses going into the final turn moved up from three to
four wide on the turn to improve position in the drive. FROSTED DIAMOND broke well to go straight to the front to set the pace for a half and tired.
PRESUMPTIVE CLOSER was allowed to settle through the final turn and passed tiring rivals. POPEYES HEART was forwardly place around the first turn
and slowly faded. GRAND JURY pressed the pace from the two path to the five sixteenths pole and dropped back.

Footnotes
WONDER RUN vied for the lead from four wide then dueled with the leader at the three sixteenths pole under a steady drive and drew clear late. B B
MOODY broke out at the start then was rushed to the lead early, pressed the pace to the turn then made a rebid and dug in late to regain the place. I'LL
RAISE YOU was off the pace in the two path then made a rail bid into the stretch had to move out to two path at the sixteenth pole and give late effort to be
up for the show. BUNKIE'S SONG was close up in the three path then went five wide in upper stretch and showed late interest and missed the show. JAKE
THE BAND MAN pressed the early pace then took the lead at the three eighths pole, was headed at the eighth pole and fought gamely but tired late.
BETTER WATCH OUT dueled from between horses in the second flight went six wide in upper stretch but failed to menace. HONORARIAN laced early
speed and passed tiring rivals. TRUE SAINT dueled from the inside in the second flight but was not a threat. STELLA'S SURPRISE hopped at the start and
was never involved. I'M LOOKING UP dueled from three wide in the second flight but never was a factor.
