Footnotes
SIR ROCKPORT stalked the early pace, shifted out nearing the half mile marker, then made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command nearing the
quarter pole, then slowly edged clear in the furlong grounds to prove best, driving. CARGO SHIP was off a step slow, chasedn the pace four wide, came five
wide into the lane and had a late rally to gain the place award. VENOMOUS STATE dueled for the lead on the inside and dug in leaving the turn but faded
late, lost place award late. TRIPLE A. PLUS was settled along the inside, advanced on the turn and eased out nearing the quarter pole and came four wide
into the lane and had no kick, needed more. ROCKET BLAST tracked the early pace four to three wide and then dropped down to the inside on the turn and
advanced on the inside by the quarter pole, but had no kick late. ROCKIN COWBOY was reserved early, five wide on the turn and came widest into the lane
and was not a threat. WAHOOWA WAHOOWA dueled for the lead two wide and weakened.

Footnotes
IMPETUD set the pace on the inside and drew out on the far turn, then was given a couple pops right handed with the crop and maintained a clear
advantage and was wrapped up late to prove best. BOOK RUNNER was void of early speed, advanced four wide on the turn and finished well to be along
for the place award. MACHO HONCHO pulled hard on the inside and was hard held, then chased the winner on the turn two wide and failed to gain in the
lane and lost the place award late. CHARLIES MEDAL tracked the pace between rivals, then was three wide on the turn and weakened. UPFOR PAROLE
was settled early, two wide on the turn and had no rally. ON AN ISLAND was four wide into the first turn, tracked the pace four wide and tired. LIGHTNING
RIDGE was rated three to four wide early, then saved ground on the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
SUNSHINE LINDA stalked the pace and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, took over leaving the turn and slowly edged clear and then
maintained a safe margin late to prove best under a mild drive. LONDON LADY was well placed along the inside, angled out leaving the turn and was
gaining late but needed more. LORDHEARMYPRAYER was reserved early on the inside, advanced on the inside on the turn, shifted off the inside and had
a mild late rally. SCOREBOARD LILY set the pace on the inside and was headed leaving the turn and weakened the final furlong. GOLDEN PHASE tracked
the early pace between rivals, then was three wide on the turn and weakened. BABY BLUE was settled back early, five wide on the turn and passed the
tiring rivals. DUST BUNNY bumped at the start, settled four wide and tired. LET'S GO MO failed to menace. JOURNEY OF FIVE stopped.

Footnotes
JACK SLYE set the pace along the inside and set slow fractions, had plenty left when roused leaving the turn and drerw off to prove much the bets under
left handed crop urging. FIRE D'ROCKET stalked the pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn and the proved to be no match for the winner while
clearly second best. FLAT BUSTED was well placed on the inside and weakened in the drive, bested rest. MR. REDOLFO was settled early four to five
wide, made a four wide bid on the turn but came up empty in the lane. SALTY HEIR was settled on the inside and lacked a rally. LIGHT WORK failed to
respond. SUMMER MIST was bumped after the start, then checked nearing the six furlong marker and dropped back. FIFTH ELEMENT chased the pace
and weakened.
