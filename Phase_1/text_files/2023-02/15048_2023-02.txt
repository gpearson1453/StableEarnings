Footnotes
NONAME BANDIT was away alertly, set a pressured early pace, went four wide into the turn, met the bid of ORGULLO MIO through the turn, dueled to the
wire and prevailed. ORGULLO MIO forced the early, went four wide into the turn, made a bid on the winner, dueled to the wire and just missed. FORWARD
OBSERVER was reserved early, advanced seven wide through the turn, was steadily closing late stretch, needed more ground and finished a game third.
PAINTED SMOKE was unhurried early, raced seven wide through the turn, angled out and finished belatedly. RARE COIN was void of any early speed,
went eight through the turn and passed tired rivals. SAY THERE KING chased the early pace, went four wide through the turn, drifted in and faded. WILD
FIREWATER pressed the early pace, raced along the inside and tired. CASH CRUZER was allowed to settle early, raced six wide and was empty.
