Footnotes
SUE'S LITTLE ZING was off the pace in the two path through the turn and wore down the leader in deep stretch and drew clear. TDZ WHAT A DEAL
sprinted to the lead to deep stretch and was out kicked late. TROSKA broke out at the start, then was close up to the pace in the three path to the top of the
stretch and weakened. WHORL GIRL had no early speed then moved up going between horses at the three sixteenths pole to improve her position.
GRACE'S SOLDIER was hustled along on the inside to vie for the lead early but proved best of the rest. BRITNEY B. was fractious in the gate then broke in
at the start and trailed the field to the turn and passed tiring rivals. AMYS CANDY tracked the leaders from the four path to the turn but was not a factor.
SUNNY AND CLEAR saved ground while racing in the middle of the pack but didn't make a serious bid. NIKLAUSIA raced in the middle of the pack to the
turn and dropped back. BEAUCLAIRE lost her rider behind the gate and was not a threat.

MAJESTIC WAYS set the pace throughout while not being challenged and held on. ANOTHER HOT MESS stalked the pace to the top of the stretch and
made a late gain but was too late. BOW BOW GIRL tracked the leaders from the two path but was no match for the top two and saved the show. EILEEN
ALEXANDRA was unhurried to the final turn then moved up around the turn to improve her position. TINCANDANCE hopped at the start, saved ground
while making a mild bid on the final turn but weakened. MY FRIEND AMY raced three wide and tired.

Footnotes
FABS vied for the lead from the two path down the backstretch then took over nearing the quarter pole, drew clear and was kept to task in the stretch. RUN
NATALIE RUN was off the pace in the two path down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the final turn but couldn't catch the leader and proved
second best. JOAN'S WAY was rushed up to contention in the early stages, made a middle move from the inside down the backstretch and proved best of
the rest. ACELA EXPRESS had good early speed around the first turn then was headed at the five sixteenths pole, chased the leader around the final turn
and tired. AVENDORE was allowed to settle down the backstretch then made a mild two wide bid on the final turn and passed tiring rivals. RETRO RITA
was forwardly placed on the inside around the first turn then retreated. SARATOGA PASODOBLE saved ground near the back down the backstretch then
made a two wide mild bid on the final turn and faltered.

Footnotes
NOMADIC PRIDE was squeezed and bump on both sides at the start, was allowed to settle around the first turn then rushed up the rail down the
backstretch and around the final turn but had no room near the end of the bent and moved between horses entering the stretch and drew off. QUEEN OF
THE MOON was allowed to settle down the backstretch, made a three wide bid at the three eighths pole and moved out to four wide in upper stretch but
was no match for the winner and was a clear second. SURREY pressed the pace from between horses to the seven sixteenths pole then chased the leader
around the final turn and dug in to save the show. REMEMBERIN RONALD vied for the lead to the first turn then took command entering the backstretch
and held that position to the final turn when she was collared after the three sixteenths pole, drifted out in early stretch and tired. BABY LOCKOUT floated
out entering the turn and lost action, then was allowed to settle down the backstretch and made a rail bid on the final turn and passed tiring rivals. NOT
ALONE bumped inside rival at the start then chased the leaders down the backstretch but was never a factor. ABBEY CAKES bumped outside rival at the
start then had early speed to the first turn, vied for lead on the inside to the seven sixteenths pole where she was in tight, taken up slightly and was done.
LADY BOLT raced in the middle of the pack to the first turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
FIRST I'VE SEEN was off the pace from the three or four path then took the lead in mid stretch and cleared late. FLASHY MEG dueled for the lead to the
top of the stretch from the inside and fought gamely down the lane to be second best. SNOWBALL raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch
then made a two wide on the turn for a steady gain to be up for show. SUGAR SHACK QUEEN raced near the back early then made a four wide bid on the
turn and gave a late kick to improve position. MISS JANA was up close on the inside and faded. SPIRITED BEAUTY was off slow then found her stride on
the turn while making an inside bid, showing late effort. SWEET TEMPERAMENT dueled for the lead from the two path to the top of the stretch and gave
way. SCARLETT O'HARA was forwardly placed early then made a mild bid into the turn and flattened out. TRACK SMART was in the middle of the pack
and dropped back.

Footnotes
MAGNA COLORS raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then launched her bid at the three eights pole from four or five wide then ran down
the leader in late stretch, matched strides to the wire and won the nod. TALENTS HOT DEAL went to a clear lead around the first turn to set most of the
pace was collared nearing the sixteenth pole and dueled with outside rival to the wire and was outnodded. MS. PRIESTLY stalked the pace from the three
path to the top of the stretch, had to move to the inside in mid stretch and made a rebid to save the show. DATS A SUPERSTAR tracked the leader from the
inside down the backstretch then moved out to two wide at the quarter pole and vied for the lead around the final turn but tired. UMEA ZING GRACE saved
ground while racing in the middle of the pack and finished evenly. SHOTGUN ANNIE failed to menace. AD LIBITUM has an awkward start then trailed the
field around the first turn, found her stride into the final turn going five to six wide in upper stretch to show late effort but was not a factor. WHY KENZLY
showed little. PURE PAM DEMONIUM was allowed to settle around the first turn then moved up on the rail and faltered. I'M CONTENT was not a threat.
