then two wide coming under coaxing half a mile from home, went three to four wide through the turn, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and kicked
on belatedly to procure the show honors. SHE'S MO BUBBLY broke in at the start bumping DOLCE SERA, chased four then three wide under coaxing from

Footnotes
LAVON jostled with a foe while between horses nearing the five-eighths, was asked in the three path on the turn, gained to take the lead into upper stretch,
fought outside of the runner-up into the final furlong, inched away into the final sixteenth and proved best under steady urging. THE SPLENDID ONE jostled
with a foe while just off the pace nearing the five-eighths then made a bid outside of the leader, took the advantage in the two path with three furlongs to run,
lost the lead to the winner into upper stretch, fought with that foe into the final furlong, swapped back to her inside lead when switched out behind the winner
around the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while clear for the place. LA CONQUISTADORA went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch,
was urged along while inside on the turn, lost the advantage at the three-eighths, dropped back nearing the quarter-pole, moved out around the furlong
marker and weakened but was clear for the show. SNOWY EVENING veered out at the start, angled in at the rear with about five furlongs to run, saved
ground around the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and was no factor. GRACEFULNESS raced just off the pace on the outside, dropped back
under urging late on the backstretch, went four wide around the turn and came up empty. PINSTRIPEPIZZO was off a step slow, settled on the outside, was
urged along passing the half-mile pole, dropped from the five path to the three path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
BRISKY FROLIC went to the front then showed the way with a clear advantage, lugged out some in the two path around the turn, spun five wide into upper
stretch then bore out, continued to get out into the final furlong but remained well clear and proved much the best while eased up late. FREUDIAN followed
the solo leader down the backstretch, chased in the three path around the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and safely secured the place while no match
for the winner. PREDETERMINED settled in third position, dropped from the four path to the rail early on the turn, saved ground from that point into the
stretch and came up empty while best of the rest. SWEET SENSATION settled towards the rear, saved ground around the turn, came out into the stretch,
remained on her inside lead in the drive and failed to threaten. MIDMON settled under some urging, dropped back in the four path around the turn and
faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

then took the lead before the three-sixteenths, moved clear outside the furlong marker and drew away under steady urging. ELECTRIC STUFF was hustled
from the gate, disputed the pace on the outside of a rival, vied in the two path around the turn, led past the quarter-pole then lost the advantage to the
winner into upper stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. MUDVILLE NINE was urged along on the far outside, went five then four wide
around the turn, dropped to the three path near the quarter-pole and came up empty while best of the rest. CHALKY CAT broke a bit slow, climbed some
while disliking the kickback inside the three-quarter pole, went two then three wide early on the turn, angled to the five path later on that bend, spun six wide
into the stretch and was no factor. ORMSTOWN moved out while urged along off the pace, went three then two wide around the turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
PHAROAH'S HEART was hustled from the gate, set the pace under pressure, was asked while inside on the turn, shook clear coming to the quarter-pole,
extended the advantage under a drive into the final furlong and proved much the best under steady urging. GLOWSITY was forced in at the start, moved out
while hard ridden early then was urged off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and narrowly earned the
place. TONED UP dropped back on the outside then angled in early on the backstretch, went two to three wide around the turn, swung seven wide into the
stretch and improved to just miss the place while able to get the show. SPIKED moved out while settling off the pace, was asked while three then four wide
on the turn and lacked the needed response. DAME CINCO broke in at the start, was well placed towards the front, chased while moving from the rail to the
two path around the turn, dropped back into the stretch and tired. INTO HAPPINESS raced well back in the field, went three wide on the turn, came five
wide into the stretch then angled to the far outside and failed to threaten. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN dropped well behind under urging, rounded the turn in
the five path and was no factor. KINGDOM QUEEN raced just off the pace, dropped back while moving from the two path to the rail around the turn and
capitulated. LIAM'S KISS was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and had nothing left. BABY MAN stalked the pace on the outside,
chased four then three wide on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and also capitulated. CHAMPAGNE POETRY pressed the pace down the
backstretch, came up empty while three then two wide around the turn and retreated. VEGAS WEEKEND was hustled from the gate, settled off the pace,
dropped back leaving the backstretch, moved from the two path to the four path around the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.
