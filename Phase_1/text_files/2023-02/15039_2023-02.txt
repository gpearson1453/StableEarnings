Footnotes
SPOILER chased the pace while in the three path, was in a steady drive to rally throughout the far turn, gained command in the upper stretch and surged to
the finish line proving best. RAIL TOWN was quick to set the pace, was in a long drive down the back stretch into the far turn and almost lasted in the early
stretch but was passed by an outer rival and was second best. BOUGIE JOE chased the pace along the rail into the second turn, then rallied on the second
turn to close well in late stretch. NERKY ROSE settled while two wide on the backstretch, then swung five wide on the far turn to bid in the stretch but came
up evenly. BAY BE GONE settled along the inside entering the backstretch, then steadied off the heels of rival around the three eighths pole, re bid
throughout the second turn but was no threat. FLYING G chased the pace while two wide on the backstretch, was in a hard drive throughout the far turn,
was used up entering the stretch and weakened in the end. DIXIE MOONSHINE trailed throughout and needed more.
