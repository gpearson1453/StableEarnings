Footnotes
ORTH stalked the top pair from outside, took aim three wide into the lane, drew alongside the leaders with a sixteenth to go and drove past to prove best.
SIX FEET was away quickly in the beginning, dueled from outside, held a short lead exiting the bend, lost command in upper stretch, battled gamely through
the final furlong and was outfinished between rivals late. BILLBERNJOEJOHNICK broke in a bit then went up to duel for command from inside, inched
ahead leaving the backstretch, raced on even terms again around the bend, lost the advantage late on the turn, fought back to regain the upper hand
outside the eighth pole but got outkicked in the final sixteenth. JOHNNY PAYCHECK broke in a bit but was quickly corrected, stalked off the rail then moved
inside while keen early, saved ground through the turn and into the stretch but lacked a late bid. CAROL'S COMIC drifted out early then lost his path shortly
after and had to pause behind rival, steadied entering the turn, went between rivals late on the bend, kept on through the lane but needed to find more late.
SUMMER FIREBALL was off slow to begin, trailed four wide to five wide into the lane and was not a factor. CHIEF COUNCIL raced in range outside rival,
rounded the bend three then four wide and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
HOLDEN THE LUTE was closest in pursuit from outside up the backstretch, challenged at the seven-sixteenths pole, took over at the quarter pole, put away
IT'S MY HOUSE entering the stretch, then met the challenge from RED FLAG at the top of the lane, disposed of that rival quickly and drew off under urging.
CLEM LABINE tracked off the rail then went two wide into the turn, moved out around the bend and spun four wide into the drive, summoned a mild late bid
and edged RED FLAG for second. RED FLAG pulled when trying to be reserved early, chased outside the top pair into the turn, rounded the bend three
wide, put in a mild bid outside HOLDEN THE LUTE at the top of the stretch but quickly lost contact and was outfinished for the place honors. TIGRE DI
SLUGO paused early when the leader came in a bit, stalked along the inside into the turn, exited the bend two wide and lacked further response. IT'S MY
HOUSE set the pace up the backstretch, led along the rail and was pressured into the turn, lost command at the quarter pole and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
BIG FLINT lugged in shortly after the start, settled in the two path, made progress through the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch, drew alongside
BELMONT BILL with a sixteenth remaining and drove past while drifting in. BELMONT BILL sprinted clear early and opened up a large lead while pulling in
the two path, remained well in front to the far turn, held a diminishing lead around the second bend, unchallenged with a furlong to go, then was challenged
in the final sixteenth and yielded late. THE KEY IS UNITY was off a bit slow on the outside, moved to the inside sitting well off the pace, saved ground to the
stretch, altered out with a furlong remaining and got up for third. THIRTY FOUR COUPE broke in and bumped ATTENZIONE, stalked a bit off the rail early,
closed in through the far turn, took aim two wide into the stretch, lacked the needed late kick in the furlong grounds and lost the show. ATTENZIONE took a
bump from outside leaving the gate, got crowded along the inside by THE KEY IS UNITY before the clubhouse turn, traveled two wide around that bend,
went three then two wide on the second turn and was not a factor. PEACE TOUR got crowded and shuffled back early, tracked inside then moved off the
rail, trailed into the far turn, dropped back around the bend and came up empty.

eighth pole, brushed TAMING THE TIGRESS and drove clear. TAMING THE TIGRESS was off a bit slow to begin, tracked off the rail up the backstretch,
drew alongside the leaders to race four deep on the turn and three deep into the lane, confidently ridden in upper stretch, asked with a furlong left to run,
brushed with ALICE MARBLE midstretch and got outkicked in the final sixteenth. EDDIE'S NEW DREAM bobbled slightly at the start, got floated out by
CHANCERY WAY early, chased off the rail then bid between the top pair into the turn, vied in the two path through the bend, inched ahead in upper stretch
but faltered in deep stretch. DORIS MAE dueled for the lead inside CHANCERY WAY early, held a slim advantage over outside trio around the bend,
relinquished the lead in upper stretch and weakened. CHANCERY WAY brushed the gate to break a step slow, drifted out early and went up to duel from
outside, vied three deep around the bend, suffered a minor shuffle near the quarter pole and weakened.

Footnotes
ALBAYAADER (IRE) unhurried in the beginning, steered to the inside and advanced up the backstretch, bumped with outer rival entering the far turn,
angled out and came four wide into the stretch, rallied to the front outside the sixteenth pole and held over the runner-up. SHE'S GOT A WAY had to pause
when losing her path early then settled inside, entered the lane two wide, lacked from upper to midstretch, tipped out to a clear path and was gaining to the
wire. PALEO'S PRINCESS stalked off the rail then outside a rival, bid three wide leaving the turn, drifted to the fence in the lane, fought inside a pair of
rivals into deep stretch and got outfinished. AVENTAPP traveled in mid-pack off the rail, was on the move three wide then bid four wide into the lane, took
over in upper stretch but yielded in the final sixteenth. KATERINI bumped leaving the gate, raced off the pace and shifted out to bump rival early, raced
between foes leaving the backstretch and bumped with inner rival entering the turn, angled out and bumped outer rival five wide into the stretch and kept on
to improve. SUPER RENEE forwardly placed in the early going, waited behind the leaders on the turn, tipped out and was roused at the top of the lane but
flattened out. GOOD BOO JOO bumped at the start, got bumped by KATERINI again on the backstretch, was floated six wide by that rival leaving the bend
and also made contact again, then failed to rally when straightened away. PEPPERMINT FLIRT was off slow to begin, trailed along the inside and improved
position in the lane. TOO BOSSY brushed the gate, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, bid outside and dueled around the turn, then tired in the
stretch run. GYPSY LYNN took control early from inside and showed the way up the backstretch, dueled around the turn while maintaining a short lead, lost
command in upper stretch and retreated.

SITTIN ON GO was keen early stalking the leaders in hand, lacked room through the far turn, came three wide into the stretch, tried to split foes but had to
check in upper stretch, launched another bid between rivals in midstretch and surged clear. NOLO CONTESTO bobbled slightly at the start, forwardly
placed five then four wide on the first turn, remained close from outside in the middle stages, bid four deep around the second bend, took over at the top of
the stretch, showed the way into the final furlong, then yielded to the winner. MR. T'S THIRSTY bobbled and brushed in the beginning, tracked in the three
path, raced in range up the backstretch, rounded the far turn three then four wide, moved out and rallied widest but could only gain the show honors.
WARRENS CANDY MAN broke in and bumped rival, recovered and went up to vie three deep into the turn, pressed early on the backstretch, before racing
on even terms with inner rivals, fought three deep through the far turn, led three wide into the lane, lost command at the top of the stretch, fought on to the
sixteenth pole and faltered. SETTECENTO vied for command along the rail, battled from the fence to the midstretch and weakened. PAPALE vied for the

Footnotes
REBEL POSSE sat off the pace then moved closer up the backstretch, lacked room from the three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths, found room to run
then tipped three wide into the stretch, took over in midstretch and gamely prevailed. REDLINE raced off the pace, went three wide into the turn, moved out
and entered the stretch five wide, rallied widest in the drive but was too late. WESTWARD LOOK showed early speed then ceded the lead, stalked on the
inside into the turn, saved ground into the stretch, tipped two wide in upper stretch and bid between rivals, fought into the final sixteenth and got outkicked
by the top pair. FINALLY HERE pulled early then settled in a stalking position, was closest in aim two wide entering the stretch, bid three deep at the eighth
pole and got outkicked in deep stretch. SAFFA'S DAY sat off the pace and moved inside, exited the bend two wide and whittle gap late. NEWPARK (IRE)
was off alertly and went to the front, became rank briefly nearing the dirt crossing, cleared inner rival and crossed over, showed the way along the inside into
the stretch, challenged at the eighth pole and flattened. HARIBOUX (GB) raced near the back then moved into range three deep up the backstretch, spun
four wide into the drive and weakened. OCTOPUS threw his head and broke slow, trailed on the inside to the stretch and failed to menace. FULLY LOADED
stalked three deep into the turn, dropped back between rivals with a quarter mile remaining and tired.

Footnotes
FAST AND SHINY set the pace outside PROCRASTINATION early, put that rival away nearing the quarter pole, fought with GOOD AS GONE into the lane,
drifted out in upper stretch, lost command in midstretch but battled back and dug in to best the runner-up. GOOD AS GONE bobbled leaving the gate,
chased outside a rival to the turn, launched a bid four wide at the quarter pole, drifted inward in upper stretch, took a short lead in midstretch while battling
with FAST AND SHINY and was bested the final sixteenth. BLESSED TOUCH was off a bit slow, chased off the rail up the backstretch, roused three wide
on the turn, lost her path behind the top pair and checked in upper stretch, switched to the outside late and finished gamely. PROCRASTINATION pressed
the pace from inside, lost contact with a quarter mile left to run and weakened in the lane. CLASSYMADEMOISELLE off a bit slow, trailed on the inside to
the stretch and failed to make an impact. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE INCIDENT IN UPPER STRETCH WHILE THE RIDER
ABOARD BLESSED TOUCH ALSO CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST FAST AND SHINY AND GOOD AS GONE FOR THE SAME MATTER. AFTER A REVIEW,
THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH BOTH FAST AND SHINY AND GOOD AS GONE DID CROSS OVER ON BLESSED TOUCH CAUSING
HER TO CHECK, THE INCIDENT DID NOT COST HER A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

bumped with rival entering the turn, went between foes on the bend, three wide into the stretch, bid three deep and took over past the eighth pole, then
drove clear. ISABEL LUDLOW was off a bit slow on the outside, sat off the pace, lacked room and steadied near the five-sixteenths pole, remained inside to
the stretch, steered off the rail and rallied to nail rival for second. MOOREA TIME stalked the pace from inside into the turn, bid between rivals in upper
stretch, led briefly at the eighth pole but relinquished the lead shortly after crossing the marker and got edged for the place honors. BLONDZILLA coaxed
from the gate, drifted out early, was on the move three then four wide around the bend, drifted in the stretch and kept on to earn a minor award. SONG OF
SHADOWS dueled briefly for the lead then cleared outer rival, set all the pace to the stretch from inside, challenged in upper stretch and weakened. BETSY
IS THE CODE bumped and got crowded leaving the gate, angled in racing towards the rear, altered out and had to steady on the turn, moved back in and
raced two wide into the lane and failed to threaten. CLASSY CANDY was off slow and bumped leaving the gate, got forced out on the turn and proved no
menace. DANEHILL SONG dueled from outside briefly then ceded control to inner rival, chased along the two path through the turn, lost path in upper
stretch and weakened after. SQUARE AND RARE chased 3deep early, continued in the three path around the bend and faded. FREYAS CATZ bumped
leaving the gate, trailed two then three wide on the turn, eased in the lane and walked off. ONE MO EDDIE chased between then got crowded near the
