Footnotes
LIBERTANGO Saved ground setting the early pace, drifted out slightly entering the stretch while opening clear and maintained a safe advantage. ISOCLINE
was prominent from the start while racing along the inside and finished well for the place in a steady effort. FAST FORWARD saved ground while being
unhurried, slipped though along the inside on the turn and was gaining slightly late. RUNANDSCORE was allowed to settle in stride while racing two-wide
on the turn, came three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. REGAL REY hopped in the air at the start, then racing five-wide on the turn, came
six-wide into the stretch and finished willingly. METATRON'S MUSE was forwardly placed for a half mile while racing three-wide and gave way. NOW THAT
ICAN ROCK dropped back early while racing two-wide and failed to threaten. OBSERVE was prominent to the stretch while racing four-wide and tired.

Footnotes
MEATLOAF'S CHANCE was reserved off the early pace, launched a four-wide bid on the turn, took the lead entering the stretch, drifted in during the drive
and drew clear late. KICK ROCKS KID broke out to brush with One Ace, then saved ground setting the pressured pace, responded when headed, steadied
while in tight nearing the eighth pole and continued on gamely to the wire when clear. THE BOATMAN prompted the pace while racing two-wide, was
unable to stay with the top two late but continued on well for the show. SAMURAI ISLAND was prominently placed while racing three-wide but lacked a rally
when called upon. SCOTCH NO ROCKS was forwardly placed from between horses and went evenly. FLOYD G broke in to bump with One Ace at the start,
then saved ground and failed to threaten. LONGER VIEW was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. ONE ACE was pinched
back at the start, then dropped well back and failed to menace. ILLUSIONED showed early speed from between horses, steadied leaving the half mile pole
in tight and gave way. The Jockey of KICK ROCKS KID lodged an objection against MEATLOAF"S CHANCE, but after viewing the films, the stewards made
no change in the order of finish.

allowed to settle in stride, rallied four-wide on the turn racing inside the winner and finished strongly. TOPPING saved ground setting the pace, opened clear
nearing the eighth pole but was unable to resist the top two late. RAMPAGE was reserved off the early pace racing between horses, got shuffled back on
the turn, came three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. VICE COP saved ground stalking the pace, but lacked the needed late response. ELI
settled in the middle of the field while racing three-wide on the turn, came four -wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. AMANI'S KITTEN dropped back
early while saving ground, steadied while lacking room nearing the quarter pole and finished willingly when clear. SOUTHERN SAVIOUR was forwardly
placed early while racing three-wide and weakened. DIAMOND STATE vied for the early lead while racing two-wide and tired.

Footnotes
HOOPERDRIVESTHBOAT saved ground setting the pace, drew clear nearing the stretch and was ridden out to increase his advantage. AZZARO STEEL
lacked early speed, rallied six-wide the final quarter and finished strongly for the place. TIZ OUR TURN was unhurried early, moved up five-wide nearing the
quarter pole and finished in a mild rally. KEEN ON YOU was void of early foot, came three-wide into the stretch and gained his best stride too late. MALIBU
TIME saved ground stalking the pace, angled out to come four-wide into the stretch but lacked rally. THAT KHENNY prompted the pace to the stretch while
racing two-wide and weakened. MY MAN FLINTSTONE was forwardly placed to the stretch while racing three-wide and tired. CROSSTOWN SHOOTOUT
was prominent early racing between horses and gave way after three furlongs. ALPINE GHOST failed to threaten while racing two-wide.

Footnotes
GLOBAL SENSATION never far back, launched a four-wide bid leaving the quarter pole, took the lead in the stretch and then was all out to prevail narrowly.
POLICY OPTION was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch, angled to the inside leaving the three-sixteenths pole and finished fast to just miss.
BOLD LOOKER dropped back early, rallied eight-wide into the stretch and finished strongly. HARD RYE GUY saved ground while being allowed to settle in
stride, lacked room from the half mile pole to the stretch, angled out and finished willingly when clear. ON THIN ICE was prominent early while saving
ground, angled out for the drive but lacked a rally. QUANTUM LEAP set the pace to the stretch and weakened slightly late. GREY STREAK bobbled at the
start, then was allowed to settle in stride and was unable to seriously threaten. JR'S GIFT settled in the middle of the field while racing two-wide but lacked a
rally. BLUE DEVIL prompted the pace while racing two-wide and weakened during the drive. AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM failed to menace while racing
three-wide. KAZAN (IRE) dropped back early and was not a serious factor. MAINTAINER was close-up early while racing three-wide and tired.

Footnotes
HURRY HURRY was reserved off the early pace, moved up strongly three-wide leaving the quarter pole, took the lead entering the stretch and drew clear
late. CAESAR'S GHOST saved ground tracking the pace, slipped through to offer a bid nearing the eighth pole but was unable to match strides with the
winner late. GO FOR IT was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. SAILOR'S CHANCE dropped back early, rallied
four-wide into the stretch and improved his position late. FEELING settled in the middle of the field while racing three-wide and went evenly. GRIMES vied
with Meant to Be Lucky for the early lead, shook that one off to open clear after a half mile, set the pace to the stretch and gave way readily when headed.
ROYAL VICKY was prominently placed early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole and then flattened out. STORMY DANSER came
three-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. PACE dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MEANT TO BE LUCKY
dueled for the lead to near the half mile pole and tired.

Footnotes
OUTADORE dueled for the lead from the outset while racing four-wide, opened clear nearing the eighth pole and maintained a safe advantage. BAKERS
BAY was unhurried early, rallied six-wide into the stretch and finished fast. DIVINE LEADER prompted the issue while racing two-wide and held on well for
the show. BLUE KENTUCKY was reserved off the early pace, came five-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. THANKS MR. EIDSON disputed
the pace while racing three-wide and weakened during the drive. NATURAL POWER (IRE) was allowed to settle in stride, check lacking room nearing the
three-sixteenths pole, angled out five-wide in the stretch and finished willingly when clear. RUSTLER saved ground while being forwardly placed, but lacked
a rally when asked. CHARCOAL vied for the early lead from along the inside and tired. JOHNNY UNLEASHED dropped back early and was not a factor.
PETIT VERDOT raced between horses on the turn, bobbled nearing the three-eighths pole unseating his rider and was vanned off. The Stewards
conducted an inquiry into the incident involving PETIE VERDOT, but after viewing the films, made no change in the order of finish.

JEALOUS EYES vied for the lead from along the inside and gradually drew clear. ROUGHIN THE CITY prompted the issue while racing three-wide and
continued on well for the place in a steady effort. PERFECT PAINTING was unhurried early, moved forward on the turn while racing three-wide, angled to
the inside nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished fast. OFFALY COOL saved ground while being forwardly placed but lacked a rally. TROPIC
STORM stalked the issue while racing two-wide, angled out nearing the stretch, checked when Noble Jon drifted out, found room during the drive and
