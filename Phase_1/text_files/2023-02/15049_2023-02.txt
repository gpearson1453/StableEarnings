Footnotes
THE GINGER QUEEN (IRE) was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, moved up to take command inside the
five-sixteenths marker, opened a clear margin approaching the stretch and held sway to the wire. LEMON DROP LADY showed no early speed, saved
ground through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with a steady rally. JEWEL AZUL lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the
second turn, reached a contending position and failed to gain late. TWELVE STARS settled off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn and
finished evenly. MUNNINGS TALE was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside with BREAKFAST BALL from the inside and weakened after
going a half. BREAKFAST BALL broke sharply to dispute the pace with MUNNINGS TALE while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. THE
RACE WAS ORIGINALLY HAND TIMED, TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

reached a contending position and failed to gain. HADLEES HONOR lagged early, raced five-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and was
not a factor. CATCHME AT THELAKE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and weakened.

AND I KNOW was reserved off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached SEVEN POINTS with a sixteenth to run, vied and was
up in the closing yards. SEVEN POINTS stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, gained a brief lead,
responded when challenged by the winner with a sixteenth to run, vied and just missed. PIPER ROSE settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out into
the stretch and finished with a belated bid. CANTERBURY GOLD sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and gave way through the
final furlong. FUN PADDY lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. SHEZ A GRINDER raced off the pacesetters
early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and weakened. AMERICAN ROYALTY lagged throughout and did not
offer a bid.

the stretch and held sway to the wire. PASSED BY PAUL settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady
bid. ALPINE HYPNOSIS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, reached a contending position and failed to gain
late. MY BOY LOLLIPOP was off slow, lagged early, saved ground through the second turn and finished evenly. RANCHER was off slow, rushed to vied,
pressed the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going five furlongs. HAVEULOSTYOURMIND chased the leaders while racing three-wide and
weakened after going five-eighths. STRAUS'S PLACE settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the second turn and weakened. FLY BUDDY
FLY lacked early foot, steadied nearing the half and weakened.
