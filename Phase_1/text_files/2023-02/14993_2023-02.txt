Footnotes
DODROPIN was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenths pole and held off
TOTHEMOONANDBACK to prevail. TOTHEMOONANDBACK dueled for the lead from the inside, steadied nearing the three-eighths marker, stayed on well
in the drive and finished willingly. MULLIGAN settled off the leaders early, ,moved three-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. MAYBEE A
DIVA showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, reached a contending position and finished evenly late. MADISON'S QUARTERS raced off
the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and did not threaten. BIG BLUE NOTE was away in good order to duel for
the lead while racing five-wide and gave way after going a half. APPOINTED STAR raced just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn,
angled out further into the stretch and was not a factor. WRIGHT WINGED broke sharply to duel for the lead from between foes, moved four-wide through
the turn and weakened.

TEXAS LONG BOW was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. PARLEY STREET lacked
early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. NEW EVERY MORNING broke sharply to dispute the pace from the inside with
the winner and gave way through the final furlong. GO ADMIRAL GO settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed
rally. WARFRONT FIGHTER was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and gave way in the drive. TEXAS
LONHRO showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

FIRECRACKER STAND sprinted clear soon after the start, raced four-wide while setting the pace, increased his margin into the stretch and raced in hand to
the wire. MIAMI CROCKETT settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and was up for the place. AUTISM CAN DO was reserved just
off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but stayed on well to hold the show. RECKONING DAY was
forwardly placed from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. MOJAVE raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the turn, reached a contending position and failed to gain late. D K'S CROWN lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. CAPTAIN N. BARRON steadied nearing the seven-sixteenths pole and lagged throughout thereafter.

Footnotes
SHESAHEATWAVE tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew off with complete
authority. TIMBERLAKE GAGE sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way to the winner through the final furlong.
CONVINCE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. CHICKS DIG MUNNY raced off the pacesetters
early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished evenly. SUPERSTAR BEA lacked early foot, raced six-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. ELEGANT CRICKET was off slow, rushed to press the pace while racing three-wide and weakened through the final
furlong. JAZZY EINSTEIN was off slow, raced unhurried early, raced off the rail through the turn and did not threaten. LE TUB raced off the pacesetters
early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. BONITA RAPIDS was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into
the lane and did not offer a bid.
