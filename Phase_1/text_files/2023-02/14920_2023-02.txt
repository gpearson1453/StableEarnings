HILL OF TARA slow into stride, rallied into the turn and stretch, split horses and ran on to get the nod on on the wire. IN LIEU outside run while never far
back, rallied with a three wide rush in the stretch but lost the nod. BLANTON off rail chase to turn, collared leader, cleared into stretch but weakened late to
settle for show spot. LET IT RIDE CLYDE broke sharp but faltered back quickly with a wide run on the wrong lead from the turn and coming on late. SAN
MARCO CITY raced along evenly with no late response in the stretch run. CRACK THE MOON rushed inside to the front, collared out of turn and, gave way
readily in the stretch run. MYTHOMANIA broke awkward, never a real menace throughout. DREAMFACTOR brief chase to the turn but gave way readily
throughout. JOHNNY'S MOMENT never menaced throughout.
