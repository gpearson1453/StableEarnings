Footnotes
HOT ROD LINCOLN broke out at the start brushing BOYS CODE and forcing SARATOGA RED to steady in between foes, chased just off the inside in
pursuit from mid pack and was patiently handled through the turn steadily gaining to be just off the pace with five-sixteenths to go, swung three wide for
home and was let out loosely splitting foes straightened away, took over command just inside the three-sixteenths and edged clear under a drive to prevail.
BOYS CODE brushed at the start by the aforementioned foe, chased four wide coming under a prolonged drive half a mile from home, steadily advanced
through the turn continuing four wide, floated out six to seven wide at the head of the stretch and continued the long steadily mild kick to secure the place
honors inside the final sixteenth. LAUREL VALLEY vied from the three path down the backstretch before tucking inside into the turn, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just inside the three-sixteenths, kept on to preserve
the show honors well clear of the rest. SORPRESO five paths off the inside down the backstretch just off the top pair, advanced half a mile from home to
knock heads for command tucking three wide through the turn, swung four wide for home in the midst of being shaken off and weakened. SARATOGA RED
got bumped at the start and was forced to steady by the breaking outwards HOT ROD LINCOLN, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch
before tucking steadily to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued just off the inside for home and tired.
SARATOGA STRONG coaxed from the start, raced just off the inside in close aim of the front before vying briefly and then taking command near the five
furlong marker, got displaced by a pair near the half mile pole and chased along the inside through the turn, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and
tired. LIOTTA chased four then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
BIG ENGINE was coaxed along on the outside, moved closer late on the backstretch, was given is cue in the four path on the turn, chased five wide into the
stretch, took the lead just inside the furlong marker, was challenged by the runner-up late and held gamely under strong urging. KING ANGELO bumped
solidly with a rival at the start, was taken in hand briefly while crowded early, settled off the pace, was roused two then three wide on the turn, altered out
from behind horses in upper stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed fast but just missed while able to get the place. SHERIFF BIANCO
bumped solidly with a foe at the start, showed good speed then chased the pace, issued a challenge in the three path around the turn, took a narrow
advantage in the four path coming to the three-sixteenths, led under a drive into the final furlong then was headed by the winner and was out-kicked while
clear for the show. NABOKOV came away in front, was taken under restraint early and conceded the lead then was rated just off the pace, made a bid while
let out along the rail on the turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. MONDAY MORNING QB went to the front, showed the way down
the backstretch, vied in the two path under some extra left-rein pressure around the turn, was asked under threat at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into
the stretch, lost the advantage at the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and drifted out while tiring. AMERICAN GENTLEMAN dropped
back then settled off the pace, was roused three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response.

shook away under some pressure from the runner up to the outside, got roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, shook off that rival and drew clear
under a drive prevail. K D KAKES broke in at the start bumping MY GORGEOUS and pinching that foe out against AMANDA'S FOLLY, raced four paths off
the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn, tipped to the two path at the three-eighths bumping QUEENPIN to the three path and
advanced to tepidly pressure the leader before spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, proved no match for that foe while well clear of the rest of the
field to be along second best. DERWIN'S PAYNTER chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
angled six wide into upper stretch and improved position for the show honors. MY GORGEOUS got bumped at the start by the breaking inwards K D
KAKES and was pinched back, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and weakened. LA CHANCE
five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home
and tired. DENIECE OF DEGRACE coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper
stretch and tired. QUEENPIN broke in at the start and was corrected, raced forwardly placed three to four wide early on before advancing to duel briefly with
the eventual winner into the turn tucked to the two path, got bumped by K D KAKES at the three-eighths and nudged three wide as that rival tipped off the
inside, swung four wide into upper stretch and folded. FOUR QUARTZ hustled from the gate, dueled inside of AMANDA'S FOLLY from the get go, got
shaken off near the half mile pole and came under coaxing at that station, faded through the turn and went four wide into upper stretch, faltered, and was
eased to the finish.

Footnotes
JONNY QUIST bumped hard with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, went four wide under urging on the turn, raced behind horses in upper stretch, was
roused approaching the furlong marker, tipped out a path or two before the sixteenth-pole and gained to get up in the final strides. DONTBELATE settled on
the outside, was roused six then five wide on the turn, rallied to the lead outside the furlong marker, led until the final strides but was denied while able to get
the place. BINGO JOHN was hustled from the gate, established a good position down the backstretch, went three wide around the turn, dropped to the rail
in upper stretch, squeezed through inside the pacesetter at the furlong marker and finished willingly for the show. ONE MORE SCORE bumped hard with a
rival at the start, was hard held behind horses early, moved out while just off the pace nearing the five-eighths, chased in the four path around the turn,
fought on even terms for the lead in upper stretch, had the rider lose his crop outside the furlong marker, battled into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked.
BREADMAN was hustled from the start, moved out early then settled on the far outside, was urged six to seven wide around the turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive, held a reasonable striking position into the final furlong but lacked the needed kick. SEANAN showed speed on the outside then
prompted the pace, took a short lead in the three path on the turn, led into upper stretch and gave way. JAY'STALKER brushed with a foe early, settled on
the outside, dropped back under urging with five furlongs to run, went five then four wide around the turn and failed to rally. JAA MODE showed the way
down the backstretch, lost the lead in the two path on the turn, dropped back into the final furlong and tired.

REGISTER broke in at the start, dueled inside of ASMODEUS coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
continued the head to head fracas through the stretch and to the wire and gamely fended off his main rival to score. ASMODEUS stumbled at the start,
recovered under coaxing to show the way early on safely in front before being joined by the aforementioned, dueled from the two path with that rival to his
inside knocking heads through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in gamely fighting head to head
through to the wire but was ultimately bested at the end. RIDE UP six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. POWER IN NUMBERS veered in at
the break stumbling awkward, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. BATTUTA D'ORO chased two to three wide under a ride from three furlongs out, continued two to three wide at the head of the stretch,
weakened in the drive. MCCULLOUGH chased inside early on and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled three to
four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. EGYPT chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, continued inside into
upper stretch and tired. THERE BE DRAGONS chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and
made no impact. YORKSHIRE PRINCE hustled from the gate, chased along the inside under prolonged coaxing from the half mile pole, angled four wide
into upper stretch and made no impact. FOXBURG hustled from the start, chased five paths off the inside under a ride from the half mile pole, dropped back
and was eased spinning nine to ten paths off the inside into upper stretch, then cantered home to the finish well behind.

Footnotes
TODAY'S FLAVOR showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the three then two path around the turn, shook clear into upper
stretch, drew off under a drive into the final sixteenth and proved much the best under strong urging in good time. KAZ'S BEACH settled off the pace, was
urged two to three wide around the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and safely secured the place. HANDSOME CAT tossed his head multiple
times outside the five-eighths then was taken up, settled on the outside, dropped back four to five wide under urging on the turn and lacked the needed
response while best of the rest. TWELTH MAN broke a step slow, moved out at the rear of the field early, was urged three to four wide around the turn,
turned into upper stretch under a drive, was bumped inside the three-sixteenths and also lacked the needed response. RUSSIAN TO WIN moved in while
settling off the pace, saved ground around the turn, moved out in upper stretch, bumped with a rival inside the three-sixteenths and failed to rally. RYAN'S
CAT pressed the winner on the outside, was asked for more in the four then three path around the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired.
GASLIGHT bobbled ever so slightly at the start, dropped to the rear of the field, went three wide early on the turn then shifted five wide and was no factor.
