Footnotes
APART OF MY CHARM was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with SMILING THUNDER, disposed of that rival before going a half,
opened a clear margin and was ridden out to be kept to task. SMILING THUNDER broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner while racing
three-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best. FLASH FLOOD was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn
and failed to gain in the drive. YOUONLYLIVETWICE pressed the pace from the inside and weakened after going three furlongs. QUEENS RANSOM was
off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

LEAD OFF stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, opened a clear advantage into the lane and held off
the closing DOUBLE PERFECTION by a diminishing margin. DOUBLE PERFECTION was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the
turn, rallied late and was gaining on the winner. MISCHIEVOUSHOLIDAY chased the leaders from off the rail and gave way after going a half. ATTORNEY
LOUIS was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished evenly. SILVER KING BAIN sprinted to a
long early lead and weakened after going a half. STAN THE HOT MAN lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

three-sixteenths pole and drew off through the final furlong. RUSTY RED broke sharply to set a pressured pace while racing four-wide and gave way to the
winner through the final furlong. RAPPORT was reserved just off the leaders early, checked nearing the half, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out
further in mid-stretch and finished with a belated bid. PARTYOFSIXTEEN was off slow then hustled along to contend, raced five-wide through the turn and
weakened in the drive. HEY JASPER lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace. RANTANEN was void of early speed, raced
five-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
NO SLO MO raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the lane and was up in the closing yards. BAROSSA
was pinched back at the start then allowed to settle, saved ground through the second turn, reached the fore nearing the furlong marker, opened a clear
margin but could not resist the winner late. HEIR (FR) settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady rally.
NORTHCUT sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way grudgingly in the drive. CITY AT NIGHT was reserved just off the
leaders early, moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter and gave way in the drive. NEXT JOURNEY lacked early foot, raced off the rail through
the second turn and was not a factor. YOU'RE THE CAUSE chased the leaders from the inside and weakened after going a half. SENSEMAKER chased
the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after a half.

Footnotes
ARIMONY pressed the pace of STARZAN from the inside, moved up to engage that rival nearing the three-sixteenths pole, vied and was up in time.
STARZAN was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by the winner into the lane, vied with that
rival through a vigorous drive and just missed. MO GEE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady
bid. SINGANDCRYINDUBAI lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out nearing further nearing the quarter and finished with a belated
bid. CREST DRIVE chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. HERBIE showed no early speed, raced three-wide
through the second turn and was not a factor. LOST THE MINISTER settled off the leaders throughout and lacked the needed rally. UNCLE FLOYD was
void of early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
SONNY SMACK was off a step slow, lagged early, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the lane, reached the fore with a
sixteenth to run and was going away late. ZESTFUL was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to offer a bid with a furlong to run, vied and
gave way to the winner through the final sixteenth. TARTINI was void of early speed, saved ground through the second turn, waited for racing room nearing
the quarter, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy. PERFECT DUDE checked soon after the start, settled off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the turn, offered a bid in mid-stretch and gave way. STITZY was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn while
racing from between foes and finished evenly in the drive. COASTAL KID was away in good order to set a pressured pace, responded when challenged
after going three furlongs, vied, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and gave way through the final furlong. MY INDY lacked early foot, was carried
out into the lane and did not reach contention. BRIX raced four-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders, moved three-wide through the second turn
and failed to rally. MUCHO DEL ORO broke sharply to press the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going six furlongs.
