Footnotes
BALPOOL tracked the pace while coaxed along on the outside, came under stronger encouragement near the nine-sixteenths, issued a challenge in the
three path around the turn, spun four wide into the stretch then took the lead under a drive around the three-sixteenths, lugged in into the final furlong,
fought gamely outside of the runner-up to the wire and narrowly prevailed under good handling. CHECK ENGINE LIGHT veered out at the start but was
quickly corrected, pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, vied between foes in the two path on the turn, gained the lead inside the five-sixteenths,
lost the advantage to the winner in the three path near the three-sixteenths, fought inside that foe while tight against the rail in the final furlong and was
denied while clear for the place. GIFTED bumped with a rival at the start, was well placed while rated just off the pace, drafted in the two path while in
dead-aim of the leading trio around the turn, shifted four wide outside the quarter-pole then gained five wide into the stretch, made an outside bid around the
three-sixteenths, battled outside of the top two while remaining on her inside lead into the final furlong and was outfinished while well clear for the show.
TRYINMYHEARTOUT bumped with a rival at the start, went to the front, showed the way in hand with company to her outside, vied inside on the turn, was
asked at the five-sixteenths then headed shortly thereafter, dropped back in the two path into upper stretch and capitulated. RIVER OAKS broke out then
stumbled, dropped well behind under urging, went around most of the turn in the three path then dropped to the two path and trailed.

Footnotes
SYNONYMOUS broke out at the start and was corrected, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing near the three-eighths and advancing to take
command nearing the quarter pole, spun three then two wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. APRIL ANTICS chased two then three
wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four to five wide for home, proved no match for the top one while along well clear and much the best
of the rest. SWEET SENSATION got bumped at the start by the veering out TEKILA and was forced to steady in behind CRYSTAL ORB, chased just off the
inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. CRYSTAL ORB established the front shortly after
the start and knocked heads with AMERICA'S PRIDE, shook off that rival showing the way tucked to the inside through the turn and came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths under challenge from the eventual winner, yielded the front near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, then tired in
the drive. TEKILA veered out at the start bumping SWEET SENSATION in behind CRYSTAL ORB, chased along the inside under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and tired. AMERICA'S PRIDE shied out at the start filling the space left vacant by TEKILA who veered out,
came under coaxing and advanced to knock heads with CRYSTAL ORB while along the inside down the backstretch, got shaken off into the turn and tipped
to the two path placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
INTERPOLATE was taken up nearing the three-quarter pole then rated off the pace, started the turn in the two path then shifted four wide, issued a
challenge with three furlongs to run, gained the lead into upper stretch, shook clear into the final furlong and proved best under steady urging. GIRL
TROUBLE disputed the pace on the inside of an opponent, vied inside to the two path on the turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch, lost touch with
the winner into the final furlong and was outfinished while clear for the place. MALIBU MOONSHINE was last to commence while a bit awkward into stride,
settled at the rear on the outside, was urged three to four wide around the turn and lacked the needed response while able to get third. ROYAL POPPY
contested the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, led past the quarter-pole then lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch and
gave way. SENIOR PRANK broke in and hit the gate, moved up to race just off the pace on the inside, was asked while saving ground on the turn, came off
the rail into upper stretch and had nothing left.

BRACIOLE four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four
wide for home, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, then edged clear under a drive to prevail. PER DIEM three wide in pursuit, advanced on the
leader under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive proving no match for the top one while running on to secure the
place honors. VOLKERT chased three then two wide down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out four to five wide at the three-sixteenths and kept on to secure the show honors.
OUTASITE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home
and weakened in the late stages. PERSISTENT DANGER chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch,
weakened. JOHNSELECTRICRIDE bobbled at the break and recovered quickly, chased along the inside under coaxing from midway on the turn, tipped

Footnotes
BOURBONIC was bumped on both sides at the start then checked while pinched back, spotted the front several lengths, settled on the outside, was roused
four then five wide on the turn, rallied outside into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead coming to the furlong marker and proved best under strong
urging. SHERIFF BIANCO dropped in at the start then bumped with a foe, tracked the pace on the outside, came under urging late on the backstretch,
chased in the four path around the turn, took the lead in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner nearing the furlong marker, fought on with that foe
while remaining on his inside lead to the wire and missed while well clear for the place. UNCLE MOONLIGHT stalked the pace on the inside, tossed his
head at the nine-sixteenths and was taken up briefly, took the lead under urging while along the rail early on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner in
upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but held the show. WINIT bumped with a rival at the start, steadied while taken under a tight
hold early then moved out under vigorous restraint, was rated on the outside, came under urging in the five path on the turn, chased outside into the stretch
and capitulated. REGGAE MUSIC MAN settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn and failed to respond. BACK RING LUCK bumped with
foes at the start, went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was headed while in the three path early on the turn, dropped back into the stretch
and tired.

Footnotes
FUNNY JOKE broke in a step at the start bumping the bobbling ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE, chased three to four wide until tucked to the two path through the
turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong and overhauled the leader
seventy yards from home, then edged away to the finish. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE bobbled and was bumped at the start, chased three wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. TURNSANDCONDITIONS chased five
then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. FENWAY showed the
way in hand just off the inside, shook away three furlongs from home to a good lead, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under
growing threat from a trio and getting a bit leg weary near the sixteenth marker, got overhauled with seventy yards to the finish when weakening in the late
stages. HANG TIGHT devoid of speed early on, quickly grew detached at the tail of the field chasing in the two path, remained two to three wide through the
turn, went four wide into upper stretch and closed in under a drive but too late to impact the outcome. WINNERS LAUGH chased four paths off the inside
down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
WRITER'S REGRET tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path around the turn, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong,
gained the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole then edged clear under strong urging. AGILITY chased the pace down the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn, was driven into the stretch in the two path, remained on his inside lead in pursuit of the leader, moved out around the furlong marker,
gained while still on his inside lead into the final sixteenth and missed while able to get the place. MY MAN MATTY brushed with a foe shortly after the start,
showed the way down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, was asked turning into the stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong, was
collared by the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened while clear for the show. GOLDEN CODE moved out while urged along, went three then
four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BASIS RISK was urged along at the rear, moved from the two path to the four
path midway through the turn then dropped back to the two path and was no factor. TIN PAN ALLEY bumped with a rival at the start, moved out under
urging, shifted further out late on the backstretch, chased in the four path around the turn and capitulated. DAUFUSKIE ISLAND bumped with an opponent
at the start then was hustled, settled off the pace, was urged three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
KANT HURRY LOVE hustled from the gate, dueled inside of QUALITY STONES from the get go coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the
inside route into upper stretch seizing command, then drew clear under a drive to the finish. KHALI MAGIC chased four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. HAPPY SOPHIA chased
three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three then two wide into upper stretch, ran on to the finish but was ultimately bested for the place
honors while never threatening the winner. SHINFULL chased just off the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, cut the corner into upper
stretch, dug in to the inside of a rival through to the finish and improved position to secure the last major share. QUALITY STONES dueled from the two path
with KANT HURRY LOVE to her inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front swinging three wide at the quarter pole and tired in the
stretch. CARAMOCHA chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. VALLELUJAH
coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide for home, tired in the drive.
