SIXTH STREET (FR) had an awkward start, raced between horses to turn, angled out split horses into the stretch and ran on game to prevail on wire. NOT
NEGOTIABLE bore in start, speed to the front, stayed game to deep stretch but nailed late. TWO WORDS just off pace to turn, rallied past quarter pole and
stayed for show spot. AUNT NELDA no speed to the stretch, passed a couple in the final furlong. SHEMADEMEBLUSH pressed pace to turn, could not stay
with leaders and folded late. MOST EMPRESSIVE sharply from the gate with brief speed but stopped readily into the tun.

Footnotes
DECREE OF LOVE bore in start to the front, rated along in hand to stretch and proved tons best in handy fashion. SOPHISTICATED inside run to far turn,
circled field past the quarter pole while proving no match for the winner but clearly best of the rest. QUEEN EKATI squeezed at start, widest to far turn,
evenly stretch for show. KNELCOCK raced along evenly with no late kick when needed in the stretch. LUCKY SHORE never menaced throughout.
MORNING LINE NEWS off rail to far turn with response when needed in the stretch. EVIE inside position to far turn, never factored thereafter. SAGE HILL
never a menace throughout. MIDNIGHT FLYER chased winner to the half, could not go on and dropped far back. SHE RANUP THE AMEX inside position
to the half, gave way readily from the far turn.

Footnotes
NICHOLAS JONES unhurried early, wide run to turn, took over, ran off smartly in the final sixteenth while well handled to the wire. PAID TWICE no speed to
the half, ask for run wide into far turn and ran on smartly to be runner up while clear of the rest. LEAD ACTOR outside run to quarter pole, made a bid in the
stretch and gamely stayed on the show spot. I'M YOUR VALENTINE raced along evenly with no response when needed in far turn and leveled off in the
stretch run. WEATHER PRAYER never far back to the half, could not stay with leaders and folded readily. BAD JOKE WOKE FOLK had a slow start from
the gate, never menaced thereafter. SHA KON O HEY raced evenly along to far turn but came up empty in the stretch run. GUS GUS chasing leaders in
earnest to far turn but ran out of gas and backed up. COALMINER'S KITTEN never reached a contending position throughout in a dull effort.
PARACHUTEBATTALION quickly to the front, led to the half, stopped inside badly late. LOOKIN' AT TURK had a tardy start and never menaced
throughout.
