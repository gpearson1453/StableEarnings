Footnotes
STARSHIP GOTHAM saved ground close up, angled out into the stretch then edged clear driving. ALONZO MOSELY quickly took control, was collared in
midstretch and continued willingly to the finish. LIBERTY RUNNER lagged far behind inside, swung wide into the stretch rallying. WHATA GUY chased just
off the pace inside and proved empty in the stretch. VANCOUVER D'ORO prompted the pace for three quarters, steadied briefly at the top of the stretch and
faded. BUSTER BRUNO lacked speed in the two path and was always outrun. FIELD OFFICER broke slowest and trailed throughout. A claim of foul by the
fifth finisher against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

Footnotes
TOURING MARYANNE raced three wide off the pace, chased three wide on the turn, bid at the quarter pole, rallied outside of CATALON, dueled, dug in
gamely outside and wore down that rival to prevail. CATALON set the pace racing off the inside with a clear lead, showed the way on the turn, responded
when challenged, dug in gamely inside of the winner and yielded grudgingly. RISEN CHANGE raced off the pace between rivals, chased two wide on the
turn and lacked a rally. I LOVE MAGEL broke awkwardly and off slow, raced off the pace inside, moved up on the rail into contention, chased and tired. TIZ
HER WAY stalked close up outside, chased four wide on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
DRENA'S BULLET raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, took over after the half and quickly pulled away under wraps. INDIRECTLY raced in the two
path well behind then rallied for the place. MONDAY'S WITH MIKE broke slowest, rushed to contention inside and finished willingly. FOREST FIRE quickly
sprinted clear, widened before the half then stopped abruptly while drifting out. STRUM AND PLUCK lagged far behind outside then caught fading rivals.
YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY angled inside early then raced far back throughout. TWO PRINCES raced outside and gave way readily.

Footnotes
DANCING ON MY OWN bobbled slightly at the start, set the pace on the inside, shook free on the turn, responded when roused, pulled away and was
ridden out. BRUNO BARBER GIRL raced off the pace between rivals, chased three wide on the turn, rallied in the stretch drive and dug in gamely to earn
the place spot. DIVINARY raced three wide off the pace, chased four wide on the turn, raced evenly and then gained mildly outside. IMAGINE RITA stalked
two wide, chased two wide on the turn and weakened. TEMPEST RISING was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside and had no rally.
ELEVENMONTHSLATER was off slowly, outrun early, advanced at the quarter pole and failed to threaten. MAP OF LIFE was bumped at the start, tracked
on the insid, chased inside on the turn and faded.

SCANDALISSIMO pursued the loose pacesetter then edged to the front near the top of the stretch and drew off driving. MINXZHIPPSDONTLEYE hustled to
the front inside, widened before the half, dueled winner and weakened. IN SPADES broke slowly, rushed to contention inside, bid closer into the stretch
then tired. TIEMPO PERFECTO lacked speed and continued well while no threat. SHOULDHAVEBEENGONE trailed early, angled inside then passed
fading rivals. LONG LEGGED BOY chased close up four wide and gave way readily. THE COLORA KID flashed speed three wide and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
KITH set the pace on the inside, showed the way on the far turn, responded when roused, edged away in midstretch and held well under urging.
CAUSALISTIC stalked outside, chased three wide on the far turn, rallied outside in the stretch run, closed well late and earned the place spot. WE BE
THERE tracked on the inside, chased along the rail on the far turn, rallied on the rail turning for home, lacked a winning bid and got up late for third. JUST A
THOUGHT broke in bumping a rival at the start, stalked two wide, chased between rivals on the turn, bid at the eighth pole and was outfinished late.
HEALY'S HOPE was bumped at the start, raced two wide off the pace and failed to threaten. WILL TAKE CONTROL was bumped and pinched back at the
break, trailed the field and did not factor. MIDNIGHT TRICK raced off the pace inside and did not factor.

Footnotes
COMMISSIONER G trailed to the three eighths pole, circled his field rallying on the turn then offered a late surge to get up in time. NICK THE CARDSHARK
settled inside off the leaders, bid on the turn, loomed a threat and continued gamely for the place. MR. ROUNDTREE saved ground throughout then closed
well through the stretch too late. BAILEY broke slowest, rushed up to duel inside then faltered. FEDERAL CASE earned a narrow advantage in the two path,
vied to the stretch and faded. FLOAT ON stalked the dueling leaders three wide and failed to rally. CUMBERLAND AVENUE lacked speed racing wide and
was never in contention. MR. EXTENSION prompted the pace to the far turn and stopped abruptly.
