Footnotes
LIBERTY SPIRIT was bumped at the start, was in a steady drive to press the pace from the two path on the backstretch into the far turn, then dug in gamely
in the late stretch and was up in the final strides. PERFECT TOM set the pace from the start, was in a long drive down the backstretch into the far turn, then
was over ran by an outside rival in the final furlong and was second best. NEPHI tracked the pace from the four path the first three quarters of the mile, then
rallied while three wide on the far turn to close well in the end but it was not enough. MAN IN THE MIDDLE chased the pace from the inside down the
backstretch, then came out four wide on the far turn to bid gamely in the stretch but it was not enough. MO HAWK MAN broke out and bumped rival at the
start, was unhurried early and no menace. SUPER LIAISON was unhurried early and failed to menace. BLACKHEATH settled in the middle of the field
entering the backstretch, then lost momentum and stopped entering the stretch drive.

Footnotes
FORT HOOD was in a steady drive to lead the way from start into the turn, then drew off under a strong hand drive to prove best in the end. EAGLEFORD
chased the pace from the inside, came out three wide on the turn to rally in the upper stretch and closed strongly to be up for the place prize.
SAMSPLAYERSLOUNGE tracked the pace along the rail, then menaced in the upper stretch to close gamely for the show position. RED DRAW was
unhurried early then came out three to four wide on the turn to bid mildly in the stretch but it was too little too late. MORO TRENDSETTER was unhurried
early then bid mildly in the stretch from the four path but came up empty in the end. MARVINS' WARRIOR stalked the pace while two wide, was in a hard
drive on the turn, was used up then weakened in the stretch. GUCCI BLING chased the pace while four wide, bid on the turn then flattened out in the
stretch. NIGHT GUARD was off slowly then raced behind the field throughout the course and was no factor.
