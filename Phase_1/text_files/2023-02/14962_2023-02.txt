Footnotes
FORT PECK within striking distance, split foes a half mile out to take over, clear into the stretch, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. WHAT
A COUNTRY four wide in the first turn when off the pace, asked along while angling three to four wide late in the second bend, steadily getting to the winner
late while outside that one. FIFTY CENT DOLLARS broke on top, dueled up front in the three path, allowed the winner a lane to advance midway up the
backstretch, chased that one into the stretch, caught late for the runner up spot. DRIVEN ONE dueled up front along the inside, weakened. CELERITY
lacked speed, remained back second turn, two path into the lane, lost whip soon after, failed to rally. JINGLE fractious in the late, last to leave, trailed while
under stout restraint through the first turn, moved out three wide second turn, remained back in lacking a response.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT'S GIRL in the second flight while four wide through the first turn, continued outside, and was four wide into the second bend, nice move outside
to challenge with a quarter remaining, quickly clear into the stretch, not threatened to the wire under firm handling. LANTERN'S CANDY behind the pace
while saving ground, continued inside into and through the final bend, modest gain on the winner the final furlong, clearly second best. ABBY THE BULL
DAWG lacked early foot off the inside, four wide through the second turn, finished up best of the rest while never a threat to the top two. ELI'S GIRL chased
the leader early while in the two path, between horses second turn, had little left for the stretch run. SHE'S HAMAZING last to leave, raced back and inside
first turn, moved out, three wide late in the final turn, improved position slightly while not posing a serious threat. HAL'S DREAM in the second flight while
racing three wide, came up empty for the stretch run. G MONEY LIV broke on top, soon sprinted clear, continued to show the way up the backstretch,
began to falter when confronted midway on the second turn. GUEST IN MY HEART void of speed, four wide through the first turn, five wide into the second,
remained back. ELEGANCE N TONIC fell back, sluggish up the backstretch, mild close late in the final turn, eased up stretch, jogged accross.

Footnotes
COLD AS HELL broke alertly, raced forwardly and three wide into and through the the turn, challenged while drifting a bit between horses past the furlong
marker, spirited late duel, gained the nod at the wire to narrowly prevail. ALVAARO broke with the field, fell back outside, advanced four to five wide turn,
challenged outside the winner approaching midstretch, dueled late, missed the nod. SUMMER IN MALIBU away in good order, pressed the leader in the
two path into the turn, took over entering the stretch, held a narrow advantage over the top two past the furlong marker, weakened a bit and could not match
strides with that pair late, remained comfortably clear of the others. BLACK STORM lacked speed, behind the lead pack in the two path entering the stretch,
lacked the needed closing response to finish up evenly. CHAPEL BARN in the second flight while racing off the inside, continued in the two path and in
some traffic exiting the turn, no kick. BIG NICK moved up inside after the start to show the way into the turn, faltered when headed midway on that bend.
GINSBURNED forwardly placed and four wide into and through most of the turn, backed up in the drive. OUT RUN'M fell back after the start to trail and was
not involved.

Footnotes
LOVE OF MY LIFE back off the pace early toward the inside, angled out four to five wide turning for home when beginning to advance, outside bid past the
furlong marker, kicked clear late under firm handling. BALI DREAMIN vied early while racing three wide, shook clear in the turn, continued to show the way
past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner late, narrowly gained the place while closest to the inside of the second flight. SAMMIES SAMURAI
pressed the issue early from between horses and three wide, fell back a bit early in the turn, asked along and came three wide for the drive, late bid for the
place, missed. CHARLEE MAE prompted the pace while widest up the backstretch, four wide through most of the turn, remained within striking distance
past the furlong marker, flattened and was going evenly at the end. FUNTIMEGIRL behind the pace in the two while in a bit of traffic into the turn, lacked a
serious response in the drive. NO DRAMA MOMMA vied up front while between horses, chased the leader through the turn then gave way when the real
running began at the head of the stretch. RYE MUNNY last away, trailed well back to be always outrun.

RING TWICE floated out a bit at the break, was straightened to press early from the outside, dueled into the turn, shook clear entering the stretch,
maintained daylight to the wire while being kept to task. WREAKING HAVOC forwardly placed while outside, three wide when moving closer late in the turn,
proved no match through the stretch, far clear for the place. ROCKABILLIE in mid pack early, moved out, four wide turning for home, just up for the show,
no threat to the top two. HER NAME WAS LOLA lacked speed outside, raced four out to five wide exiting the turn, improved position slightly while never
dangerous. BEER CAN LADY broke out but alertly, washy when showing the way early, dueled into the turn, gave way late in the bend while along the
inside. NELLY LARKIN moved out, raced four wide late in the turn, faded steadily in the run through the stretch. ABBY DABBY fell back after the start and
was never a threat. TRIBAL SPIRIT off slowly, trailed throughout in showing little.

VEGAS BLUE bumped with QUALITY CHROME at the break, was forwardly placed while well out in the strip, pressed three wide into the turn, took over
entering the stretch, shook well clear by the furlong grounds, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. ALITA settled off the pace in the two path,
steered out four wide turning for home, roused, steadily closed the gap on the winner late. QUALITY CHROME bumped with winner just after the start, was
forwardly placed up the backstretch along the inside, angled two to three wide turning for home, chased the winner past the furlong marker, weakened a bit,
no match for the runner up, narrowly saved the show. UNIFIED GURL lacked early foot outside after breaking out, four out to five wide in the turn, displayed
a mild amount of late interest to be gaining for the show. BLUE COWGIRL off a step slow, moved up to race in mid pack while along the inside, went evenly
through the lane in lacking a closing kick. THE X FACTOR lacked speed, three wide turning for home, went one paced through the lane. GO GO GO moved
up inside to show the way into the turn, vied through the bend then gave way when headed by the winner turning for home. ROWDY DAISY pressed the
pace in the run up the backstretch in the two path, began to gradually weaken before a half. CANARY NATION with the second flight out of the gate, fell
back early while three wide and did not menace. TRUEBLUEGIRL trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
DARK TIMBER broke sharp from along the inside, alternated up front from the rail, had a head in front entering the stretch by continuing to save ground,
headed a furlong out, battled back in game fashion to narrowly prevail. SHADY EMPIRE also away in good order, set or forced pace two path, three wide
into the lane to lose some ground to the winner, rejoined that one soon after, showed the way past the furlong marker, outkicked late while remaining clear
for the place. LAKE RADIO behind the pace just off the inside, dropped to the rail turn, cut the corner into the stretch, steered out for the drive, all out to
preserve the show, slow gain on the top pair late. MEGATAP within striking distance in the second flight up the backstretch, three wide into the turn, two
wide and between horses exiting, outfinished for the show. SPEND BENJAMINS off a step slow, raced back and outside, slight steady with a half to run,
four wide through the turn, improved position slightly while widest through the stretch, not enough late for the show. PAPA ROCKET off a step slow, raced
back and off the inside, four wide and in traffic exiting the bend, made little impact with clear the final furlong. SQUARE DEAL prompted the pace while four
wide into the turn, steadily retreated through the lane. TOTALIZER off step slow, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
COGBURN broke well, showed the way up most of the backstretch in the two path, relinquished the advantage to an inside rival into the turn, dueled with
that one into the stretch, disposed of that same rival when straightened for home, enough left to withstand the next two at the wire while fully extended. LIFE
IS HARD broke sharp, allowed the two leaders to go early, second flight and three wide through the turn, roused for the drive, finished willingly to be getting
to the winner while between rivals at the wir3e. SPANKSTER lacked speed off the inside, three wide through the turn, shifted out for room with a sixteenth
remaining and was going best of all late while widest of the first flight. IMPROBABLE JOURNEY moved up inside to wrest control from the leader into the
turn, dueled with that one then gave way when the real running began at the head of the lane. LEAGUE OF LEGENDS lacked speed along the inside, four
wide late in the turn, made little impact through the stretch. CHASING TIME off slowly, four wide through the turn, had nothing left for the drive. TEXAS RED
HOT fell well back after the start, sluggish, three to four wide turn, trailed in.

Footnotes
NAVY SEAL bumped just after the start, raced forwardly and three wide up the backstretch, vied late in the turn, put a head in front entering the stretch,
kicked clear under steady handling. BELLAMYS ROAN bothered at the start, raced back off the pace, three wide turn, traffic while still in the three path into
the stretch, rallied for the place, not a threat to the winner. ROLLING FORK off a step slow, raced back and inside, steered out three wide into the lane,
encountered some traffic upper stretch, finished willingly when clear to be in time for the show. TWISTED DIXIE void of early foot, two path into the turn,
steered out to be five wide for the drive, widest down the lane to improve position. BETTYS CASH broke on top, clear early, continued to show the way turn
along the inside, faltered when headed by the winner entering the stretch. BIG SUCCESS off a step slow, trailed for a half three wide, improved position with
some belated interest after the issue had been decided. ONE TEN STADIUM pinballed just after the start, settled in mid pack along the inside, continued to
save ground into the stretch when improving, flattened out in the run down the lane. HERITAGE PARK chased the leader for four furlongs in the two path
and gave way. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN in mid pack while racing in the two path, failed to muster a response. BLAME J D came in, early bump, four wide
and forwardly placed for a half, gave way through the stretch. REEF'S DESTINY failed to menace while racing four down to three wide through the turn.
