STEALING APRIORITY pressed two wide and between a pair of rivals while under steady urging into the turn, vied around the bend, kicked clear leaving
the quarter pole, and held sway under a drive. ARCTIC ROSE pressed outside of the top pair and from the four path around the turn, failed to keep pace
with an inner counterpart while spinning into the lane in the five path, then chased that foe home well to prove second best. HEREWECOMETOGETYOU
laid off of the pace in the two path, inched closer turning for home before fanning to the six, then seven, path in upper stretch, claimed show in approaching
midstretch while staying on willingly as he hung on his left lead, and failed to menace after changing leads in the final sixteenth. ARGYBARGY BUCK trailed
in the three path, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and moved up. GENERAL EISENHOWER laid off of the pace along the inside, and never got
involved while hanging on his left lead. INTHEALY quickly sped to the front and crossed over, was confronted by a pair of outer pressers at the half mile
pole, got headed by them approaching the five sixteenths marker, and weakened through the lane while requiring correction from attempting to lug out.

Footnotes
SIKUM tracked two wide and between horses, got keen while running into the leader's kickback while among foes at the nine sixteenths pole, settled into
stride into the turn, pursued from behind the leaders around the bend, dove inwardly to a rail seam leaving the quarter pole, slipped through to bid inside of
the leading trio at the three sixteenths pole, forged an advantage at the furlong grounds, and kicked clear. MADAM HENNY tracked outside of the leading
pair and from the four path around the turn, produced a bid in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner bidder approaching the final sixteenth.
NOSTALGIA took a brush from an outer rival at the start, set the pace inside of pressing foes while in the two path, dug in turning for home, vied between
horses in upper stretch as the eventual winner produced a rail bid, but was headed at the furlong grounds, and yielded in the late stages.
THINKITASADONATION prompted the leader from the three path, bid turning for home, vied between horses in upper stretch as rivals bid on either side,
then yielded at the furlong grounds. TEXAS TIDELANDS leaned in at the start and was off a bit slow, lagged behind along the inside around the bend, cut
the gap entering the lane, and improved two wide and between horses in midstretch while hanging on her left lead. PI YO PRINCESS lacked speed in the
four path, then shied to the seven path leaving the quarter pole when an inner rival bore across her path, and made little impact. BLUEBIRD SING broke a
step slowly, laid off of the pace along the inside, bore out to the nine path passing the quarter pole, and tired on her left lead. MEDWAY QUEEN leaned in
and brushed a rival at the start, stalked along the inside, but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
MONGOLIAN BEE stalked three wide, pursued the clear leader from the three path while inside of a rival around the turn, chased that foe through upper
stretch, drifted out leaving the furlong pole, yet sustained a late grind as the leader tired, bid nearing the wire, and prevailed between horses.
FASTNFURIOUS cleared off early on, showed the way in the two path around the turn, maintained a clear margin through midstretch, but was caught
nearing the wire. RAMMER JAMMER broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, trailed three wide, took the turn in the four path five path, then stayed
on willingly through the lane while hanging on his left lead, closed in on the tiring leading pair in the final sixteenth, but ran out of ground to catch them.
LET'S GO RANDOM took a bump from an inner rival at the start, tracked four wide, then three wide from the four path around the turn, but faded between
horses in upper stretch. LIT A SHUCK never got involved from the two path. PREMIUM chased along the inside, and gave way turning for home.

UNIFIED DREAMS vied along the inside around the first turn before allowing an outer rival to set the pace nearing the backstretch, rated back to stalk from
the inside, tipped outside of the top pair turning for home as their only challenger, sustained a bid at the three sixteenths pole, dueled with an inner game
rival while hanging on his left lead through the final furlong, and prevailed. TRIGGER HAPPY emerged from between horses to set the pace two wide into
the first turn, cleared and tucked to the inside entering the backstretch, resisted an outer bid turning for home, repelled that foe as an outer UNIFIED
DREAMS menaced approaching midstretch, dueled gamely with that foe through the final furlong while hanging on his left lead, but was bested. ARABIAN
PRINCE stalked two wide, bid around the far turn, vied entering the lane, but faltered between horses nearing midstretch. PATH TO SUCCESS pursued
from midpack along the inside under snug restraint around the first turn, got shuffled back to trail nearing the backstretch, inched closer to track the top trio
around the far turn, but flattened out and only managed to chase them through the lane. GIANNIS lacked speed four wide, but was through after a half mile,
and eased through the lane. PRINCE OF GLORY laid off of the pace three wide and between horses, failed to respond to urging into the far turn, weakened
before being eased around that bend, then strolled to the wire before walking off.

before shaking free entering the final furlong. HE'S GOT THIS took a bump from an outer rival t the start, prompted the pace two wide, vied around the far
turn, led approaching the five sixteenths pole, but was turned away nearing the furlong grounds, yielded, yet lasted safely for place. MILLARD'S SMILE
settled at the rear in the three path, moved out to the four path while advancing around the far turn, gained show at the three sixteenths pole, and kept on
willingly. CARTIER CAT tracked along the inside, but failed to sustain position around the far turn, then chased from between horses to hold a minor share.
BONUS APPRECIATION bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked three to two wide and between horses, but faded around the far turn. CRIMINAL
DEFENSE laid off of the pace in the two path, raced at the rear entering the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, surpassed outer rivals
approaching midstretch, but flattened out without making an impact. RUSSIAN TANK tracked four to three wide, but failed to keep pace with the top two
despite heavy urging around the far turn, and weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
JEEPER broke well, followed just behind the leader in the first tier, angled outside at the top of the lane, was asked in upper stretch, responded to bid at the
eighth pole, and edged away for the win. SEEKING UNITY bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked the leader from the three path, hooked CELLULOID
HERO nearing the lane, led while battling gamely, but was passed on the outside by another rival, and settled for second best. CELLULOID HERO bumped
an outer rival before being bumped by an inner foe at the start, took the lead into the first turn, was quieted along the backside, got hooked by company
moving into the stretch, battled with SEEKING UNITY down the lane, and fought gamely, but was passed by eventual winner on the outside, and tired late.
ACTION SEEKER bumped an outer rival leaving the gate, traveled along the rail in the third tier, was asked at the three eighths, responded but not enough.
WOLF HUNTER failed to sustain midpack position around the first turn, dropped further back coming onto the back side, and faded at the three fulong pole.
SAILOR'S RETURN broke a step slow, was able to catch the third set in the first turn, stayed with those rivals along the backside from the three path, and
tired after the half mile.

Footnotes
WONDERFUL JUSTICE (GB) stalked three wide, pressed the top pair under urging around the far turn, bid in the five path entering the lane, forged an
advantage coming to the furlong grounds while flopping back to his left lead, drove clear while lugging inwardly entering the final sixteenth, then lasted from
an outer on-charging foe late. HE'S GOT SWAGGER settled off of the pace in the two path, briefly awaited racing room turning for home, produced a rail
rally in upper stretch, shifted outside of the leaders leaving the furlong grounds, surged in the eight path in the final sixteenth to range up to the leader
nearing the wire, but came up short. DESERT DUKE stalked behind the leader and from the two path, pressed outside of that foe along with an outer rival
into the far turn, bid in the four path entering the lane, led in upper stretch before being headed by his outer bidding counterpart nearing the furlong pole,
and yielded in the final sixteenth. DECCAN PRINCE (IRE) set the pace along the inside, met a pair of bids around the far turn, got headed in upper stretch,
and gave way. TRYSTINTHENITEAWAY bobbled a bit at the start, lacked speed in the four to three path around the first turn, tucked to the two path around
the far turn, and made little impact. FORTUNE got keen between horses early on, settled in midpack in the two path approaching the first turn, chased the
leading trio around the far turn, then drifted out in upper stretch before faltering. ASTERN BANKER broke a step slow, trailed in the three path, fanned to the
eight path entering the lane, and failed to factor. FOE tracked in the three to four paths around the first turn, tucked to the three path while failing to keep
pace with the leaders into the far turn, and faded turning for home.

Footnotes
PRAY FOR US vied three wide, led turning for home, held sway through midstretch, shifted out to meet MIA ANTONIA's wide challenge in the final
sixteenth, and gamely clung to advantage to the wire. MIA ANTONIA laid off of the pace along the inside, trailed into the turn, swung to the five path at the
three furlong pole, then to the seven path entering the lane, rallied outside of foes to bid in the final sixteenth, but was denied. STARSNMOTION chased
from the two path, angled outside of rivals while grinding away between horses in midstretch, but was shut off when the leader shifted across his path in the
final sixteenth, and gained show. BITSY PERFECTMATCH vied two wide and between horses, got headed by an outer rival around the far turn, fought on
through the lane while hanging on his left lead, but yielded a sixteenth from home. PERIPHERAL VISION vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, but gave
way into the turn, chased around the bend, but faded while hanging on his left lead through the lane. REINA ACES laid off of the pace four wide, gained
show from inner rivals at the three furlong pole, but weakened in midstretch. BITSY'S DOUBLE DAY lacked speed in the three path and between horses,
and was outrun through the lane.
