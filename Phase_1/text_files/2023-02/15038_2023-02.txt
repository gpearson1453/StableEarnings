Footnotes
IMA CARPE DIEM Hustled from outside draw and cleared to rail and lead, maintained position throughout, fended off two foes to outside down the lane,
resolute in victory. SHACKEY'S LOVE Let outside rival clear and settled outside in a stalking position, three wide up the backstretch and moved squarely
into contention three deep down the lane, grinded up ground late but just missed. CROSS EXAMINE Taken ahold of along rail and set up well off pace,
progressed throughout run up backstretch inside and breached into the fray at the quarter pole, split pair of rivals at eighth pole and battled between, not
enough. MY SON CHRIS Broke a touch slow and made up half of back pair throughout running, engaged four wide as the field approached the turn, made a
faint threat which was ultimately mitigated by the continuing top trio. PIRATE MISCHIEF Pressed two wide in the opening stages, remained contentious until
being adjoined by other rivals at the quarter pole, gave way without much fight.

Footnotes
RED NOON RISING Stalked on rail opening stages, made steady middle move up the backstretch, loomed two wide approaching the quarter pole, engaged
in battle from that point and fought through lane, lifted late to win. CHARMANT E Broke inwards, stalked on rail, overtook for the lead at the half-mile pole,
joined by outside rival at the quarter pole, dueled throughout lane on inside, outfinished. QUEEN OF LOVE Tracked off the pace two deep, showed
improvement at quarter pole, no better than third best. CLUBHOUSE SAINT Taken back to trail early, in three path on first turn, idled along backside, four
wide bid on turn, mild headway down center of course gained a few placings past tiring rivals. PLATINUM GREEK Off pace on inner part of course, got out
slightly into the first turn, never impressionable in running. LOVELY LOLA Tracked inside, asked at quarter pole, never improved. ALLIE'S PAL Sent hard to
lead and battled on rail through opening stages, overtaken by gaining rival at three eighths pole, steadily faded from there to wire. WE ALL AGREE Broke
sharply outwards, engaged and sent hard to duel for early lead, failed to corner into the first turn and ended up on outer rail by the time field reached the
backstretch, taken out of contention from that point and taken care of all the way home.
