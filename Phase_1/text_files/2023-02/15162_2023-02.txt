Footnotes
CARPE HORSESHOE pressed the issue up the backstretch off the inside, dueled through the turn, shook clear from between horses past the furlong
marker, enough left to hold off the runner up at the wire. FIRST EMPRESS back off the pace and the inside, floated out five wide into the stretch, late burst
the final sixteenth, rapidly getting to the winner late. GP'S AMAZING GRACE in the second flight, floated out four wide inside the runner up exiting the turn,
up late for the show, not a threat to the top two. LADY ASTRID in mid pack toward the inside, got out late in the turn a bit, went evenly through the stretch,
not enough for the show. FOREVER HOME forwardly placed while outside, four wide into the stretch, remained within striking distance past midstretch, flat
late to lose a couple of of positions. WARM BEAUTY off slowly, trailed most of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided.
EMERALD PRINCESS broke alertly, vied inside, until just over a furlong remained, gave way in the drive. KEWPIE DOLL remained always back while
racing along the inside.

Footnotes
WESTOVER in mid pack early while three wide, in some traffic onto the backstretch, continued in mid pack up the backstretch, began to move closer far
turn, dropped inside turning for home, got through, challenged soon after, shook clear, kept to task late. MR WORKS settled off the pace in the two path,
continued one paced off the inside second turn, closer into the lane, moved to the inside midway down the stretch, chased the winner home in proving
second best, no match. MR. WULLY BULLY void of speed off the inside, three wide when beginning to advance second turn, in traffic then four wide
entering the stretch, rallied to be well clear for the show, slowly getting to the runner up. LOBO IRISH five wide into the first turn, four wide onto the
backstretch, continued outside to be four wide through the second turn when moving to challenge, flattened out through the lane to finish up evenly. BUBBY
BOY off a step slow, raced back and off the inside, made a mild gain five wide through the second bend, flattened out in the stretch run. RIANTE SKY
hesitated at the break, raced well back, moved out to be five through much of the second turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. FLASHY
BOY GOES away in good order, sprinted clear, extended that advantage before a half, briefly responded when challenged in the second turn, steadily gave
way through the stretch. DABOOGEYMAN off a step slow, void of speed, modest traffic 2nd turn, lacked a bid in the drive. LOUD BOY closest to the leader,
continued to chase that one up the backstretch, lodged a brief bid between foes midway on the second turn, weakened. ALLELUIA ANGEL in mid pack in
the two path through the first turn, moved out, four wide through the second bend, tired. AUNT CARI in the second flight inside, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
CACTUS broke back, outrun up the backstretch, closer in the two path turn, swung out three wide when advancing out of the turn, bid soon after, edged
clear under steady handling. BACKSIDE BUZZ void of speed, three to two path late in the turn, moved out slightly for the drive, rallied, up late for the place.
RITHM NIC pressed the issue early from the two path, moved up to vie through the turn, held a narrow advantage by late in the turn, raced on equal terms
with the winner through upper stretch, proved no match for that one late. ATKINS broke back, trailed in the run up the backstretch, brief wait along the rail
late in the turn, moved out, improved position late, not a threat to the top three. DIXIE FURY forwardly placed and four wide through the turn, had little left
for the drive. ELI'S PROMISE narrowly set the pace along the inside up the backstretch, vied turn while continuing to save ground, backed up through the
stretch. MARKS PROMISE prompted the issue three wide and between horses for three furlongs then began a steady retreat.

Footnotes
G T FIVE HUNDRED with the pace from the start, dueled into the turn, shook clear of the other speed by late in the turn, extended that advantage upper
stretch, maintained a comfortable advantage while being kept to task. GUCCI BOY behind the first flight toward the inside early, worked way out to the three
path by late in the turn, slowly closing the gap on the winner while staying clear for the place. HYPER SPEED off a step slow, moved inside to save ground
turn, steered out nearing midstretch and was along for the show. TEXAS TED lacked early foot, in the two path through most of the turn, improved position
through the stretch while remaining off the inside, not enough for the show. IMPRESSOR went one paced throughout while three wide through the turn.
STORM APPROACHING broke on top, dueled up front inside the winner for three furlongs, first to blink. TAP THAT DIAL lacked speed, three to four wide
late in the turn, failed to muster a rally. RANSAM PAYNTER forwardly placed early, four wide into the turn, got out late in the bend, backed up through the
stretch.

Footnotes
ALEX'S STRIKE outrun in the early going, moved closer in the two path late in the turn, got through along the inside to challenge past the furlong marker,
took over inside the furlong marker, drifted a bit late, narrowly gained the nod at the wire. LIGHTNING STRUCK off a step slow, lacked speed, four wide into
the lane, bothered by a drifting ESPIONAGE in upper stretch, rallied, challenged late outside the winner, just missed. ALEBRIJE in the second flight well off
the inside, swung out to be five wide into the lane, steadily drifted out past the furlong grounds, lugged out late to bother MYSTERY MO then narrowly held
that foe at bay late for the third spot. MYSTERY MO in the second flight outside, floated out by ALEBRIJE exiting the turn to be six wide, continued to be
carried out by that drifting rival past the furlong, steadied, bothered by that same foe who was lugging out late. OCELOT back off the pace, came three wide
for the drive, vied past the furlong marker, was going evenly late when squeezed between foes. BIG NICK vied up front while in the three path and between
foes up the backstretch and through the turn, had little left for the drive. SQUARE DEAL moved up to be a pace factor soon after the start, set or forced the
issue for four furlongs and began to falter. ESPIONAGE vied up front on the outside, continued to vie four wide through the turn, drifted out while tiring
through the stretch. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF MYSTERY MO AGAINST ALEBRIJE FOR INTERFERENCE THROUGH THE
STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FOURTH.

Footnotes
MO SILVER broke on top, relinquished the early advantage, chased that foe into the turn, four path through the bend, steady gain nearing midstretch
despite lugging a furlong out, bid a sixteenth out, edged clear. OLD SCHOOL FLASH in mid pack between horses up the backstretch, three to four wide
stretch, rallied for the place to finish up willingly. COROMANDEL in the second flight off the inside, set down for the drive, lacked a winning punch while
gaining nod for the show. BIDOFHONEY moved up to sprint clear soon after the start, extended that advantage turn, got out late turn, saw that lead shrink
when straightened, headed inside the furlong grounds and faltered. BLUE COWGIRL off a step slow, raced back early, swung out six wide turning for home
and improved position. BOOTLEGGING GIRL broke in good order, raced in the second flight well off the inside, five wide into the lane, steadily faded.
UNIFIED GURL in the main body while between horses early, continued between foes turn, four wide into the lane, lacked a closing response. GREER
CROSSING off a step slow, steadied, raced back, three wide and free of traffic into the lane, improved position while passing mostly tiring rivals. ALTAR
GIRL fell back to trail after the start, continued well back, also picked off some faltering foes after the issue had been decided. CANARY NATION was
finished early while racing just off the inside. SWEET HOLINESS well wide up the backstretch, four wide turning into the stretch, faded. FANCY HILL in the
main body well wide, five wide into the lane, carried seven wide turning for home, backed up.

Footnotes
IPSUM GRATUS forwardly placed toward the rail closer in the two path second bend, dropped to the rail and challenged the two leaders entering the
stretch, edged clear late under steady handling. MOHAYLADY lacked speed inside, continued to save ground second bend, shifted out when straightened
for home, finished willingly out in the strip to be getting to the winner late. MIDNIGHT'S GIRL broke alertly, cleared into the first turn, continued to show the
way up the backstretch and into the far turn, between foes into the lane, weakened when headed. WATERWORKS chased the leader from the outside and
in the three path, crept closer and launched a brief bid exiting the final turn, faltered. WEST SIDE GIRL lacked speed off the inside, three to four wide
second turn, lacked a significant closing response. BLACK KAT TAPS in mid pack while off the inside, three wide into the far turn, remained back through
the lane in lacking a closing response. RUSSIARUSSIARUSSIA last to leave, void of speed while racing off the inside, continued to trail just off the inside,
lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
MAHAAMEL broke alertly from the inside, showed the way into the turn while continuing toward the rail, vied into the far turn, shook clear into the stretch,
drifted out, then in midstretch, stayed clear late under firm handling. BEN DIESEL back off the early pace inside, continued in the second flight while saving
ground through the second bend, could do little with the winner the final furlong, clear for the place. TEN GAUGE settled off the pace and the inside early,
saved some ground in the two path in the second bend, chased the winner past the furlong marker but could not contain the runner up, remained clear of
the others. EFFICIENCY settled in the second flight in the three path, came four wide for the drive, lacked a serious closing response. FILM STAR forwardly
placed early just off the inside, very rank behind the leaders first turn, moved out, four wide through the second bend, came up empty for the drive.
BROOKLYN DIAMONDS squeezed back at the start to be off slowly, carried out into the first turn to be six wide, trailed for six furlongs, passed a couple of
tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. FIGLIO DEL RE (IRE) pressed the winner from the two path for six furlongs, gave way late in the final turn.
SUMMER IN MALIBU got out into the first turn, raced four wide through that bend, remained in the four path and was never a factor.

Footnotes
STELLAR LILY broke on top, showed the way into and through the first turn in the two path, continued to set the pace up the backstretch and into the far
turn, shook off her nearest pursuer turning for home, remained clear for the drive while kept to task. NO GUILT within striking distance, chased that one
through the second turn, shifted out for the drive, finished willingly to earn the place. UNSTABLE PRINCESS void of speed after being bothered slightly at
the start, saved some ground second turn, continued back, moved out four wide for the second turn, staged a useful rally to earn be in time for the show.
GOLDENSHUGA chased the winner off the inside, moved closer in the second turn to lodge a brief bid, flattened out in the drive. ABBREVIATION void of
speed toward the inside, continued in the two path second turn, improved into the lane then lacked a further advance. MAGIC BUBBLES broke in the air,
trailed after a half, moved out, fanned six wide into the lane when making a minor advance, also flattened out in the final furlong. MISS ANALYZED in mid
pack and three wide, in traffic while five wide into the lane, also lacked a closing response. GOLDCREST saved ground to no avail in lacking a closing
response. PIVOSKY four wide in the first turn when back, fell further back before a half to trail, three wide second turn, always outrun. JUST AN ANGEL
prompted the pace while racing three wide for six furlongs, caved in stretch. STAR OF TOMORROW bothered slightly at the break, in the second flight
early, finished after a half.
