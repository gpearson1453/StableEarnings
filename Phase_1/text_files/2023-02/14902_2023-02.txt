Footnotes
ROYAL BLUSH settled off the pace while racing two wide, advanced between foes around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch, closed outside under
left-handed urging and was up in deep stretch. PILLBOX stalked the pace inside, tipped three wide to advanced around the far turn, took over in upper
stretch, kicked clear, drifted out left-handed urging in the final sixteenth and was unable to resist the winner late. DOWNBURST raced off the pace two and
three wide and ran on for the show. CAPPY pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, led to upper stretch and weakened.
SPIRIT OF POWER saved ground and failed to menace. CROSS FLEET tracked the pace three and four wide and came up empty in the lane. DOVE IN
CHARGE set the pace inside and gave way near the three-eighths marker. DUE TO A PHOTO FINISH MALFUNCTION, THE FINAL MARGINS ARE
CHARTCALLER ESTIMATES.

Footnotes
STEALTHTHIRTYFOUR raced prominently in the four path, bid passing the quarter pole, took the lead and was roused while floating out to the six path into
the lane, drew clear into the final furlong, and was wrapped up late. PAPA KATZ brushed the inner side of the gate, trailed from the four path into the turn,
shifted inside and moved up turning into the stretch, and ran on under left handed urging from the rail for place. SUPER GREMLIN was prompted along in
the three path, fanned out under a drive to the seven path entering the lane, and kept on down the center for show. CORPORATE AFFAIR set the pace in
the two path, was headed passing the quarter pole and lost the lead while under right handed urging from the three path going into the stretch, and faded.
EXTRACTION WILL brushed an outer foe leaving the gate, rated in the five path, swung out to the nine path into the stretch, angled in through the stretch,
but flattened. ROYAL INTEREST brushed with an inner foe at the start, chased from the six path into the turn but was no menace in the stretch.

DREAM OF BLESSINGS chased in the four path early, moved up and took over the lead rounding the turn, was cued to open up entering the lane,
responded well and was much the best. ANTILLEAN hopped out of the gate, stalked in the two path, floated out to the eight path under right handed urging
in upper stretch, and kept on for place. NAPA DUDE brushed with an inner foe at the start, pressed in the two path, brushed with an inner foe entering the
lane, angled out to the six path going into the final furlong, and flattened out but won the photo for show. TAKING WHAT'S MINE set the pace in the three
path, yielded to the winner and brushed with an outer foe entering the stretch, and lost the show photo. HOLLYWOOD HERO was hustled along in the five
path early but never threatened from the six path in the stretch. DISCREETLY THRIFTY broke out an brushed an outer foe, tracked in the three path but
was no factor in the five path in the stretch. CAPODECINA trailed from the five path early and was no menace. CAPT COMPLICATED lost the left iron early
in the opening quarter and was off the pace in the three path, dropped back to last and regained the iron turning into the stretch, bore out suddenly in upper
stretch, was corrected but then lost the whip going into the final furlong, and was never able to challenge.

LADY HAMILTON stalked the pace two wide, took the lead near the quarter pole and drew clear under a drive. ANGELAS PARTY GIRL raced three and
four wide in midpack and finished well to gain the place. ARTIFACT (GB) saved ground well back, swung six wide near the quarter pole and rallied widest.
INFLUENTIALOUS set the pace along the rail and weakened in the lane. CRIMSON PRINCESS tracked the pace three wide and faded in the lane.
MURSAL checked soon after the start, saved ground off the pace and never threatened. NO WASABI FOR ME failed to menace while racing two and three
wide. SHEA D SECRET played no factor while racing three wide. PSYCHEDELIC was shut off and forced to check nearing the first turn, chased the pace
inside and lacked a closing bid. PRUSSIAN BLUE was outrun inside.

PLEASECALLMEBACK trailed along the inside early, angled out and was cued to range up around the far turn, bid from the six path into the lane, took the
lead going into the final furlong and held sway under left handed urging. SOUPER LEGACY pressed the pacesetter in the three path, bid around the far turn
and was ridden from the four path into the stretch, and kept on to hold place. CUPID'S DUDE rated in the four path, was roused around the far turn and in
the five path entering the lane, angled outside of the eventual winner going into the final furlong, and ran on for show. EXULT chased in the five path, was
driven from said position while between rivals into the stretch, but flattened out late. NO MAN LEFT BEHIND had to steady early around the first turn,
tracked between foes in the four path, was short of room entering the lane, angled in to the two path and found an opening going into the final furlong, but
was no factor. T VILLE set the pace in the two path, was under left handed urging turning into the stretch, but yielded. STRONG AGAIN stalked in the two
path but gaveway rounding the far turn.

Footnotes
SWOONATRA broke well to set the pace while shifting inside around the first turn, was cued right handed in the two path turning into the stretch, and dug in
gamely to hold off a late bid from an outer foe in the final furlong to win. BUILT DIFFERENT rated in the three path, was coaxed while tipping out to the five
path around the far turn and was in the six path entering the stretch, ran on to bid going into the final furlong but was repelled by the winner for place. ANDIE
ONE trailed in the two path early, shifted out around the far turn and was urged from the seven path into the stretch, and rallied down the center for show.
MARIA'S HONOR was a bit fractious in the gate, raced off the pace in the two path, was roused from said position rounding the far turn, but got stymied and
was short of room passing the quarter pole, angled out to the seven path in upper stretch and stayed on but was unable to factor. LAMASCO had to steady
slightly early around the first turn, prompted the pace in the two path, was driven from the four path into the stretch, but flattened. BALL GOWN chased in
the three path, was coaxed into the far turn and ridden from the five path into the stretch, but faded. GRANDMA'S PUDDING tracked in the three path, was
under a drive going into the far turn, and yielded entering the stretch. TURBIE stalked along the inside but gaveway at the top of the lane.
