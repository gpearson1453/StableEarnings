DA JOURNEYGIRL led the way throughout, raced in the three path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and held her lead to the wire. THE
MONEY MACHINE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began to move up while racing in the three path around the bend and
continued to improve position in the lane. MY BATON ROUGE veered in sharply leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run
up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and kept on in the stretch. WIFEY MATERIAL raced off the pace on the outside early, navigated the turn
from the three path and made no bid. SORTARIA raced off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued around the turn in the
two path and was empty in the lane. LUVISANAKI chased the leader up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the bend and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
LIKING IT TWISTED led the way on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held that
margin to the wire. PONY GIRL bumped mildly with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leader up the backstretch, challenged
from the four path coming around the bend and kept on to the finish. BARBARA pressed the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile,
dropped back while saving ground around the turn and finished evenly from there. I'M A CUTIE raced off the pace on the inside early, came around the turn
in the two path and gained ground mildly in the stretch while never threatening. BID ONCE bumped with the horses to both sides and was pinched back
leaving the gate, recovered to stalk the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid while racing in the three path around the bend and flattened
out in the lane. LADY MISTRESS bumped with the horse to her outside at the start, trailed the field throughout, saved ground around the turn and was not a
factor.

TIZ TRIUMPHANT angled in to lead the field on the inside up the backstretch, continued to show the way racing in the two path around the turn and held off
a closer in late stretch. ASSERT DOMINANCE veered out and bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, was in traffic early and settled off the
pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid while saving ground around the bend and gained ground late. THAT'S MY BOI TOY stalked
the pacesetters between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the far turn from the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and
improved position mildly in the stretch. FELIX THE FOX hopped up and was bumped by the horse to his inside at the break, recovered to track the leaders
on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path and finished evenly. PUNX was bumped and forced to check while having contact
with several horses just out of the gate, dropped back to race off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and
never threatened. LUIS TWO GUNS chased the leader on the inside through the opening stages, saved ground around the bend and faded in the stretch.
DON H drifted in and bumped with the horses to his inside in the opening strides, pressed the pace on the outside up what remained of the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the four path and tired in the lane. THE RIDER OF HORSE THREE, PUNX, FILED AN OBJECTION AGAINST HORSE SEVEN, TIZ

ALEXA'S DREAM raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from
the four path coming around the far bend and kicked clear in the lane. SINGALONG KAYLA bumped mildly with the horse to her inside at the break, was
sent to an early lead while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the two path around the far turn, was
caught in upper stretch and chased on to the wire. I'M NERVOUS NOW raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the far
turn from the three path and improved position in the stretch. HAPPY RIDE saved ground early, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, came
around the far bend in the three path and weakened in the lane. INVESTMENT INCOME bumped lightly with the horse to her outside leaving the gate,
raced in the two path around the first bend, settled off the pace between horses for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and made
no bid. ROUNDABOUT trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path and
was empty from there. SHE'S JUST QUALITY saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the

TOPPER T chased the leader up the backstretch, challenged while racing in the three and four path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and
held off a closer while drifting mildly late. GREAT KING (FR) raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, continued around the turn in the three and
four path, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground steadily to the wire. SIR OLLIE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through
the opening quarter of a mile, began to move up coming around the turn, entered the stretch from the five path and continued to improve position from there.
CHICKS DIG SCARS trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and improved position mildly in the lane while
never threatening. WHISTLEWHILEYOUMOW raced off the pace on the outside through the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and made no
bid. THATSAFACTJACK led the field up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the bend and tired in the lane.
