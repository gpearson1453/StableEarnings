BOSS CARA dueled outside, took over midway on the turn and remained safe while kept to a steady drive. WITHOUT A VIEW saved ground off the pace,
angled outside on the turn and made a gradual late gain. RISEN CHANGE lacked speed then offered some late energy outside. LADY BERNADETTE
earned a narrow advantage inside then was finished after half a mile. GOLDEN BOW chased behind the dueling leaders inside and gave way. TIZ HER
WAY roughed at the start, trailed far behind then caught a fading opponent. FALL CAMPAIGN raced three wide down the backstretch and gave way.

clear, driving. ALMOND CIDER showed good early speed to set the pace, opened up a clear lead, dueled inside of the winner past the eighth pole, dug in
gamely and then yielded. ASH OF MY ENEMY was reluctant to load, raced off the pace inside, rallied inside in the stretch and earned the show spot. SUPE
raced off the pace, chased the leaders on the turn and was outfinished for third in the stretch drive. ALIGNMENT was off slowly, outrun early and did not
factor. KING SWANSBORO was off slowly, raced off the rail, off the pace, three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. SIR CUPID raced off the pace and

Footnotes
IMPERIAL MOON set the pace racing with a clear lead, respnoded when roused, dug in gamely when challenged at the sixteenth marker and held on
determinedly. EXCITABLE LADY tracked close up on the inside, chased on the turn, angled out, rallied outside, loomed outside the winner at the sixteenth
pole, then finished evenly. BIG ANDY raced off the pace inside, rallied inside in the stretch run and closed well late. ADHWAA stalked close up outside a
rival, chased on the turn and weakened in the lane. PRINCESS KAIRA was outrun early, advanced inside on the turn and failed to threaten. KNOCK OUT
KID chased the leaders, chased on the turn, lacked a bid and tired. FED POLICY raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor.

Footnotes
CALL FITZROY raced five wide into the first turn, settled off the pace near the inside, moved up on the far turn, angled out entering the stretch, rallied
outside, closed willingly in the final furlong, charged to the front and pulled away. SEAT OF HONOR raced off the pace inside, came two wide into the
stretch, rallied inside, closed well late but second best. WILD UNION set the pace on the inside, was pushed along by stalking rivals on the backside,
responded when roused, dug in gamely in upper stretch, yielded and then held on for third. WAGON BOSS stalked two wide, chased the leaders on the far
turn and rallied mildly outside in the lane. LONG GRAY LINE raced three wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace, came four wide into the lane and lacked
a rally. MO READY pressed the pace racing close up two wide, chased on the far turn and weakened in the lane. PIGGYBANK tracked inside, chased
inside on the far turn and had no rally. MR. BRIGGS pressed the pace racing close up three wide, chased on the far turn and faded. AWE MUN raced four
wide early and was outrun. DUBROVSKY raced off the pace, was pulled up on the far turn and vanned off.

Footnotes
MALIBU STAR settled close up inside, took over after half a mile and pulled away under moderate pressure. ROUGH SEA prompted the pace three wide,
moved with the winner on the final turn but was no match. ABUELO NUNO vied for the advantage outside for half a mile and weakened. WILLY MC chased
wide off the leaders and continued willingly while no threat. SKILLFUL lacked speed along the inside and was never a factor. NO SALT hustled to narrow
advantage in the two path and faltered. MAKABIM dropped back after a sluggish break and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
WORLD GONE WILD broke in the air and was off slowly, quickly recovered and rushed up into contention, lacked room behind the leaders at the half mile
pole, then stalked in the two path, waited for room on the turn, steadied sharply at the quarter pole, angled out, rallied four wide into the stretch, gained
command, drew clear and then held well under urging for the victory. JULIET'S MUSIC raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the turn, angled out,
came five wide into the stretch, rallied outside, finished well but second best. KENAI COOL raced off the pace inside, advanced at the quarter pole, angled
out entering the stretch, then rallied mildly near the inside. PENANCE was off a bit slow, trailed the field, moved up at the quarter pole, angled out in the
stretch, rallied mildly for fourth. SIZZLING ROMA dueled three wide for the lead, dueled on the turn and tired. ANGINETTI chased five wide, continued
outside on the turn, came five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. CALL THE PO PO dueled between rivals for the lead, dueled on the turn and faded.
MRS. CREWS chased four wide early, chased on the turn and tired. CONGRATS ANSWER dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, then steadied at
the eighth pole while tiring. MAGICAL ANNA raced off the pace between rivals, went four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. B B'S ROCKET raced off
the rail, off the pace and gave way.
