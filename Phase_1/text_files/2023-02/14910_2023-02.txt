quarter-pole, remained on his inside lead while battling with the runner-up until inside the furlong marker, swapped to the proper lead at that juncture then
edged clear under strong urging. STEADY PROGRESS brushed with a foe early, showed speed between horses, dropped back with six furlongs to run then
tracked the pace, made a bid in the three path on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop, fought with the winner into the final furlong then was
outfinished while clear for the place. HOME SCHOOL settled off the pace, was urged along late on the backstretch, saved ground for most of the turn then
shifted three wide, came six wide into the stretch and improved for the show. SECOND AND REED disputed the pace on the inside of foes, vied along the
rail under urging early on the turn, dropped back with three furlongs to run, came off the rail late on that bend, moved out into upper stretch and weakened.
SARATOGA STRONG brushed with an opponent early, showed speed on the outside, moved in inside the three-quarter pole, contested the pace outside of
a rival, vied in the two path on the turn, moved to the rail while dropping back late on that bend and tired. PRACTICALLYMINE dropped back at the start,

SMOKE AND HEAT was urged along just off the pace, chased in the three path around the turn, gained to take the lead in upper stretch and drew away
under strong urging. STJAMES bumped with a rival at the start, dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground for most of the turn then shifted three
wide, moved out in upper stretch and improved for the place. MAD MAGIC raced just off the pace, chased in the two path around the turn, dropped closer to
the rail approaching the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch and weakened while able to get the show. NORTH POLE bumped with rivals while last to
commence, moved up to get the lead then went clear, rounded the turn in the two path, was set down in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner
outside the furlong marker and gave way. LEFTY'S WAR bumped with an opponent at the start, was urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on
the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. OMERTA CODE was hustled from the gate, raced just off the pace, chased inside on the
turn, dropped back late on that bend and capitulated. GOLDEN PURCHASE broke out at the start, was forwardly placed on the outside, chased in the four
path around the turn, floated six wide into the stretch then drifted further out and had nothing left.

DRINK THE WIND bumped with a rival at the start, disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the three to four path early on the turn, dropped to the two path
while moving clear later on that bend, responded well under a strong hand-ride in upper stretch, was given one pop of a right-handed crop coming to the
furlong marker then switched to a left-handed crop and held under strong urging. BIG VENEZUELA settled off the pace, moved out with about six furlongs to
run, moved closer while urged four wide around the turn, chased the winner in the stretch, gained on that foe to the wire but missed while well clear for the
place. LORD GATLING settled off the pace, was given his cue in the two path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch under a drive and just earned the
show while no match for the top two. NORGAY bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, raced outside under urging, went three wide on the turn,
was driven five wide into the stretch and came up empty. BUCKINGHAM PRINCE was fractious in the gate then backed out and deemed fit to run by the
state veterinarian, showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of the winner, dropped back in the two path midway through the turn and faded.
CLASH A. J. was fractious in the gate, raced at the rear under urging, saved ground on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
FANCY AZTECA hit the inside of the gate then bumped with a rival at the start, settled on the far outside, was asked while six then five wide on the turn,
made a bid while being bumped in the seven path into upper stretch, took the lead at that point, shook clear into the final furlong and proved best under
strong handling. PEBBLE LANE bumped with a foe at the start, moved out early then chased the pace, went around the turn in the three path, came six
wide into the stretch then bumped soundly with the winner, pursued that foe to the wire and was second best. LADY SHYLOCK broke in front, showed the
way under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was headed in the two path into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and
weakened while just able to get the show. SHASI broke out and bumped with a rival, was urged along off the pace, went five then four wide around the turn
and failed to rally. BELLA MICHELLE broke out at the start, settled off the pace, moved in late on the backstretch, went three then two wide around the turn
and lacked the needed response. BUSTIN HOT bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, was urged four wide on the turn, came eight wide into
upper stretch and also lacked the needed response. MAGGIE T bumped with foes at the start, pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path around
the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and faltered.
