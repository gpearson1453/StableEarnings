Footnotes
SOCIAL SUCCESS was rated early and moved to the outside four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn, took over leaving the turn and drew clear to
prove best under a drive. PRECIOUS AVARY was bumped at the start, then was well placed towards the inside, was boxed nearing the quarter pole and
eased out for racing room and made a four wide bid leaving the turn and finished willingly to be clearly second best. AFRICAN ANGEL pressed the pace
three wide and made a two wide bid on the turn to gain the lead, then was headed by the winner at the quarter pole and weakened the final furlong, held
show award. WARRIOR'S RANSOM was settled two wide early, came five wide into the lane and had no kick. DOCTOR ABBIE was settled back early,
advanced on the inside on the turn and lacked a solid late rally. I CAME TO DANCE was settled early and tired. FILTERED LIGHT was settled early and
four to five wide on the backstretch and tired. LADY LIGHTFEET set a pressured pace on the inside and stopped.

the far turn, shifted off the inside and came four wide and finished willingly to best the rest. COLONEL MOORHEAD vied for the lead on the inside and
weakened. CHARGING LION tracked the pace and shifted out entering the backstretch to be four wide, then was three wide on the turn and tired. A T M

Footnotes
HIGH STRIKE set a pressured pace on the inside and shook clear leaving the turn, then maintained a safe margin to the wire, driving. ROCK ANNA ROLL
pressed the winner three wide and kept on to the wire but was second best. FIERCE AND STRONG steadied along the inside by the half mile marker, then
saved ground on the turn and had a belated rally on the inside to gain the show award. MIGHTY MINION chased the pace early, two wide by the quarter
pole and weakened. BEJUCO chased the pace three wide and weakened. RECKLESS JONES was settled early, came five wide into the lane and had no
rally.

DEE JAY pulled early three wide, then went on to set the pace in the two path and settled nicely, then was nudged along on the turn and shook clear, then
dug in gamely in the stretch and held off CONDITION ONE to prove best under a vigorous drive. CONDITION ONE tracked the pace three wide, then was
ridden along on the turn to keep DEE JAY in range, then came three wide off the turn for aim, then was gaining late but could not get by, good effort. KAZ
SUGAR BANK was rated along two wide, came four wide into the lane and had no late kick, bested rest. DEB'S GUNFIGHTER was reserved three to four
wide, came five wide into the lane and had a belated rally. LINGFIELD PARK set a pressured pace early on the inside, then stalked the winner on the inside
on the backstretch and weakened. FRIENDLY FELLA chased the pace three wide and tired. DEVOTED KITTEN was reserved and wide and had no
response. OUR LUCKY MAN was off slowly, then refused to pick up the bit and was pulled up, walked off.
