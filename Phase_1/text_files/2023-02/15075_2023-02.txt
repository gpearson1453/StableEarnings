Footnotes
TRUPIA was keen while up close in the five path around the first turn and took the lead in the four path into the backstretch, took back under a hold and
prompted the inner leader passing the half, retook command while in hand into the far turn, was roused from the four path into the stretch, and drew clear.
IMPETUOUS SOUL bumped with an outer foe leaving the gate, rated in the two path, was coaxed rounding the far turn and swung out to the six path into
the lane, and kept on down the center to get up for place. FIVEFIVE SIX CHAMP led around the first turn but was passed by the eventual winner going into
the backstretch, settled in the two path and re-inherited the lead passing the half, surrendered the lead again to the eventual winner while shifting to the rail
into the far turn and was under urging in the two path at the top of the lane, and was one paced to hold show. STRAIGHT TIME bumped with an inner foe at
the start, tracked in the four path, was roused into the far turn and cued right handed in the five path entering the lane, but flattened passing the eighth pole.
BLAST THE MUSIC settled off the pace in the four path but was never a factor. FREDDY'S MUSIC stalked in the three path but faded turning into the
stretch. UNCLE MARK trailed throughout around the three path.

Footnotes
COSMIC SPECULATION set the pace in the two path, kicked clear in upper stretch, drifted out under left-handed urging through the final sixteenth and held
safe. VICTORIA'S CHIEF settled off the early pace while racing two wide, edged closer three wide around the far turn, tipped four wide near the quarter pole
and ran on without seriously threatening the winner. GET KHOZY prompted the winner in the three path, was one-paced through the lane and held on for
the show. FORTHELOVEOFART raced off the pace three wide, lugged in in upper stretch, straightened out under left-handed urging in midstretch, lugged
in again late and just missed third. CHROMOTION saved ground in range and faded in the lane. VANISHING INTEREST was outrun inside. NOBLE TIGER
prompted the pace four wide and tired nearing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
MABEE LUCKYNWILD was sent to set the pace in the two path, was roused when challenged by an outer foe approaching the quarter pole and was cued
left handed in the four path at the top of the lane, shrugged off that challenger and opened slightly in the final furlong, and held safe under steady left
handed encouragement from a late surging outer rival. HOTLINE TO HEAVEN stumbled badly at the start and broke outward, tracked in the three path, was
cued along the inside around the turn and angled out to the seven path into the stretch, and rallied down the center while angling in for place. CAPRIDREY
chased along the inside, was coaxed turning into the lane, and finished evenly around the two path for show. ADIOS DIXIE prompted the pace in the three
path, was roused to bid nearing the quarter pole and in the five path entering the stretch, but was repelled entering the final furlong and flattened. ARETE'S
CHALICE trailed in the four path into the turn, swung out to the center entering the lane, but never threatened. MUGURUZA threw her head and hopped at
the start, raced off the pace in the five path, moved up into the turn, but was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
JACK THE CAT raced in range two wide, angled five wide nearing the head of the lane, closed outside under confident handling and edged ahead late.
RESTORED ORDER set the pace along the rail, shook clear in upper stretch, led to deep stretch and held on between foes for the place. CATATUMBO
saved ground off the pace and rallied along the rail. BOURBON THUNDER stalked the pace three wide, bid nearing the quarter pole and flattened out in the
lane. DRILLOMATIC had his head turned at the start, raced off the pace two wide, tipped out in upper stretch and improved position under mild urging.
CASH CALL KITTEN failed to menace while racing two and three wide. HEY BOSS raced off the pace two wide, went four wide around the far turn, angled
six wide in upper stretch and never threatened. BENELUX was outrun inside. KASIM pressed the pace two wide and faltered in the lane.
ROBINTAKINCHARGE refused to break and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND FOUND TO REASON TO
TAKE ACTION.

Footnotes
DEM A WONDER raced prominently in the five path early, was roused in the three path into the turn and ranged up passing the three-eighths pole, bid
passing the quarter pole and took a narrow lead in the four path entering the stretch, and edged clear in the final furlong under right handed encouragement
to win. AWESOME INDRA dueled for the lead in the four path, took command into the turn, shifted to the rail under rousing approaching the quarter pole
while being challenged by an outer foe, lost the lead to that foe entering the lane, and fought on along the inside before yielding in the final sixteenth to
place. HAZARDOUS HUMOR bobbled badly at the start and was bumped by an inner foe, tracked in the four path, was roused passing the three-eighths
pole and cued right handed passing the quarter pole, and finished evenly in the five path thru the stretch for show. CHARGE ACCOUNT chased in the five
path, was under right handed urging while floating out to the seven path into the lane, and stayed on but was no factor. ELUSIVE MOLLY trailed from the
center into the turn and never threatened in the stretch. STRONG SILENT dueled for the lead in the two path, tipped to the rail while losing the lead into the
turn, and gaveway entering the stretch. BARGAINAIRE broke out an bumped a bobbling outer foe, rated along the inside into the turn, and was no menace
in the four path in the stretch.

FREDO set the pace along the rail and held sway under a drive. HAPPY RUNNER bobbled just after the start, stalked the pace inside, tipped two wide in
upper stretch and finished evenly for the place while trying to lug in. GUARANTEED SPECK tracked the pace three wide, bid nearing the quarter pole, could
not match strides with the winner in upper stretch but stayed on for the show. BOSQUE REDONDO saved ground off the pace, swung four wide in upper
stretch and lacked the needed rally. LONG TERM raced off the pace two and three wide and had no response. TEN EXTRA hit the starting gate, pressed
the winner two wide and retreated around the far turn.

ADIOS BABY prompted the pace in the three path, was driven around the turn and in the five path entering the stretch, and drew past a pair of inner foes
under left handed encouragement in the final sixteenth to win. TO A T raced off the pace in the four path, was ridden around the turn but lost the whip just
past the quarter pole and fanned out to the seven path into the stretch, rallied down the center to get up for place late. AWESOME ANNMARIE stalked in
the two path, waited for room along the rail around the turn, received a right handed cue and bid in the two path entering the stretch, kept on to take a
narrow lead passing the eighth pole, drifted out slightly under left handed urging and bumped SONICUS in deep stretch, and was outfinished by a pair of
outer foes late to finish with show. SONICUS set the pace along the inside, was roused in the two path when challenged by AWESOME ANNMARIE
approaching the quarter pole and was urged right handed in the three path into the stretch, lost the lead narrowly going into the final furlong, continued to
fight on between foes, but was bumped by AWESOME ANNMARIE late and missed minor rewards. MY SASSENACH rated along the inside, was ridden in
the two path around the turn, floated out to the five path and brushed with an outer foe into the stretch, and flattened. GITANA brushed with an inner rival at
the start, chased in the five path, was ridden in the six path into the lane and was brushed by an inner foe, and was tired. DIGNIFIED brushed with an outer
foe leaving the gate and trailed throughout around the two to three paths.

Footnotes
JELLICLE KATZ set the pace in the two path, was roused when challenged by an other rival approaching the quarter pole, floated out to the four path into
the lane, lost the lead going into the final furlong, but dug in under left handed encouragement and fought back to regain the lead inside the final sixteenth
for the win. WEST BANK tracked in the five path, ranged up in the four path around the turn and was roused to bid nearing the quarter pole, received a left
handed cue in the five path at the top of the lane and ran on to take a narrow lead into the final furlong, but hung and was caught by the game inner
pacesetter inside the final sixteenth to place. MYSTIFY chased in the six path into the turn, was in the five path rounding the turn and was cued right handed
nearing the quarter pole, was back out in the six path at the top of the stretch, and kept on to get up for show in the final furlong. MOON ROSE bumped with
an outer foe at the start and was prompted along while off the pace near the rail, moved up going into the turn and was urged in the two path turning into the
lane, but finished evenly. A J'S MEMORY rated in the four path, was coaxed in the three path rounding the turn, angled out to the seven path entering the
stretch, but was no factor. ERIN'S MOMENT stalked in the three path, was held up and shuffled back going into the turn, was roused in the four path
approaching the quarter pole, but was empty in the stretch. KAREN'S HONOR trailed in the seven path into the turn and was eased into the stretch. VALIA
bumped with an inner foe leaving the gate but broke well anyways and pressed the early pace in the four path, but gaveway rounding the turn and was
eased in upper stretch.
