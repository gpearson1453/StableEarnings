Footnotes
COUSIN BOB was well rated and advanced on the inside on the backstretch, then eased off the inside and made a bid for command on the turn between
rivals, took over leaving the turn and drew off in the furlong grounds to prove much the best under a drive. THE MAN TO SEE was away alertly to set the
pace on the inside, was headed on the turn, then proved to be no match for the winner wile holding the place gamely. JACK SLYE stalked the pace three
wide and made a four wide bid on the turn but flattened out, missed place award. LUCA AT THE SPA chased the pace and was four wide on the turn and
fell back, then shifted in by the quarter pole and had no rally. COMBATING was taken back early, came wide into the lane and had no rally. BALTIMORE
BULLEIT was off a step slow, then settled and was four wide on the backstretch and tired.

Footnotes
SHATTER ME was away alertly to set the pace on the inside, turned back the bid from HELLO GRACIE by the quarter pole and drew clear leaving the turn
and remained clear to the wire to prove best. HELLO GRACIE stalked the pace and made a three wide bid bearing the quarter pole, but was turned back by
the winner while clearly second best. SCHOOL OF THOUGHT was settled on the outside, raced five wide on the turn and then was along for the show
award. FAIR LASSIE chased the pace and was three wide on the turn and faded. GOLDEN ACCOUNT was settled early between rivals, then was two wide
leaving the quarter pole, went to use crop left handed and lost it leaving the turn and had no rally. GLOSSY MADRINA had no rally while saving ground.
WHAT A BEAUT was between rivals at the half mile marker and four wide entering the turn and weakened. LIMONATA was not a threat.

LAKE NAKURU was void of early speed, made a four wide move on the turn to loom boldly leaving the turn, then drew off in the final furlong to prove much
the best, ridden out. CORT'N ASONG stalked the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to take over and draw clear by the quarter pole,
then was headed leaving the furlong marker and was no match for the winner, second best. FIFTY SHEAS OFGREY set the pace on the inside and was
headed on the turn and weakened, bested rest. PURPLE SHIRT passed the tiring rivals. MINE TO HOLD was settled three wide and tired. BAVARIA was
four wide into the first turn, then settled five wide and tired. SPIN CYCLE chased the pace on the inside and stopped.

NAZARENO steadied early on the inside, then was reserved while saving ground, split rivals while launching a bid nearing the three eighths marker, then
advanced on the turn, closed up the inside to edge clear late to prove bets, driving. FED CHAIR was away alertly to set the pace on the inside, came two
wide off the turn and clear, then continued to be clear by the furlong marker but was caught late while being clearly second best. KAZ MUNNINGS tracked
the pace and made a mild bid three wide on the turn but had no late kick, bested rest. JUMP FOR THE WIN was reserved three wide early, came four wide
into the lane and had no rally. RISEN SAVIOR lacked a rally. FREEDOM'S START was off slowly, then raced on the outside and was not a threat. BAILEY
COFFEE tracked the pace on the inside and stopped. PER RULING 23042PN FROM THE PENNSYLVANNIA HORSE RACING COMMISION NAZARENO

Footnotes
HIGH HEAT pressed the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command, then kicked clear in the lane to prove best under a drive. I SEE
THE STARS was well rated early, advanced in hand on the turn, angled out for racing room leaving the turn, made a three wide bid and split rivals nearing
the furlong marker and finished willingly to be second best. SCARY LARRY was settled early and advanced two wide on the turn, came three wide into the
lane and had a late rally to gain the show award. CALCULATED THINKIN was reserved early towards the inside, came two wide into the lane and had a
belated rally to just miss the show award. DEVIOUS MO prompted the pace and made a four wide bid on the turn and then was empty the final furlong.
DEVIOUS BANKER was settled and chased the pace four wide on the turn and had no rally. BERHANU set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened.
MIDDLE EARTH was reserved early, saved ground on the turn and was not a threat. TOMASCO failed to menace. COMMISSIONER BIGGS was not a
factor.

Footnotes
POCOPSON STATION was reserved early towards the inside, advanced three wide on the turn and swung out seven wide leaving the turn, closed well late
to get up in time under a drive. WAGON BOSS was well placed along the inside, then was ridden along on the urn to maintain range by the quarter pole,
came three wide into the lane and made a bid to gain the lead late then was denied on the wire by the winner to just miss. ROLLING PALISADES pressed
the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn and was clear leaving the turn and by the furlong marker, but was caught in deep stretch, held
show award. SON OF A SAINT was off slowly, settled back early, advanced on the outside on the turn, came widest into the lane and had a late rally on the
far outside and just missed the show award. PAL CAL was settled early, five wide on the backstretch, four wide on the turn and kept on but needed more.
VISHNU tracked the early pace three wide and faded. DIGGERS DIAMOND was reserved on the inside and lacked a solid rally while saving ground
throughout. JOJOMAR set a pressured pace on the inside, then was headed on the turn and angled out for aim leaving the turn and weakened.
KRACHENWAGEN was four wide into the first turn, chased and then tracked the pace four to three wide and weakened.
