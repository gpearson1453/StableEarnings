OLD TIME REVIVAL hopped up slightly leaving the gate, recovered to duel on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around
the turn, kicked clear in the stretch and held off a late closer at the wire. ASK FOR BODE trailed the field on the outside through the early going, began a bid
from the three path coming around the turn and continued to gain ground late, narrowly missing. NEW YORK STYLE raced off the pace on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the bend and improved position mildly in the lane. LORD OF LEGENDS dueled on the outside up the backstretch,
continued to battle from the three path around the turn and weakened in the stretch. LOUD N PROUD raced off the pace between horses through the
opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. MAXIMUM FACTOR chased the leaders up the backstretch, raced in the two
path around the bend and tired in the stretch.

and pulled clear in the stretch. FUNNY ENOUGH pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and chased the
winner home in the lane. EXAGGERATED HUMOR chased the leaders between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid from the three
path coming around the turn and kept on to the finish. FEEL LIKE GUESSING led the way on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground
around the track and weakened in the stretch. RAIN OF BLESSING raced off the pace on the inside early, switched out to the five path for the run around
the bend and showed no kick. REDZILLA raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two and three path and made no

CREATIVE CLOUD tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and dueled down the stretch, drifting out in the final
furlong and just holding the win. FULTON STREET chased the pace setters on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, challenged from the three
path coming around the turn and dueled down the lane to narrowly miss. THAT'S MY BOI TOY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, saved
ground around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late to just miss. TIZ TRIUMPHANT led the field up the backstretch, dueled
from the two path around the bend and gave way in the stretch. MO WINE PLEASE hit the gate leaving it, recovered to stalk the leader on the outside up
the backstretch, offered a bid from the three path coming around the turn and flattened out in the lane. PUNX raced off the pace on the outside through the
opening stages, navigated the turn from the two path and was empty from there. GABBYS BIG NOTION raced off the pace on the inside early, saved
ground around the turn and made no bid. ACTION WARRIOR trailed the field throughout, raced in the two path around the bend and was never a factor.

LIKING IT TWISTED broke last and was urged up the rail to take the lead after the opening quarter of a mile, continued to show the way while racing in the
two path around the turn, swung slightly wide entering the stretch and stayed clear to the wire. RAW HONEY dueled on the outside up the backstretch,
raced in the three path around the turn and kept on to the finish. MORE MUCHO stalked the leaders between horses early, saved ground around the bend
and chased the top two home in the lane. C'EST PARTI trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn and improved position in
the stretch. STARSHIP PRECIOUS raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the three path and
passed tiring horses in the lane. BELLA ROMANCE tracked the pace setters on the outside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the two path and
faded in the stretch. MARACAS BAY raced off the pace on the inside early, continued around the turn in the two path and made no bid. PRETTY DEVIL
dueled on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, dropped back to chase the leaders up what remained of the backstretch, saved ground around
the turn and tired from there.

path around the second turn and weakened in the final furlong. COLOR THEORY saved ground early, raced up the backstretch off the pace on the inside,
continued to save ground around the far bend and never threatened. JET CITY WOMAN raced in the four path around the first turn, tracked the leaders on
the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three and four path and faded in the stretch. WITS AND WAGERS raced in the three path

Footnotes
TALLAHATCHIEBRIDGE raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began a
bid from the three path coming around the far turn and gained ground to get up for the win late. DAMIR led the way from the two path around the first turn
and into the backstretch, dueled on the inside nearing the half mile pole, saved ground while battling around the far turn and dug in in the lane, getting
caught late. BATTLE SCARS saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far
turn, began a bid nearing the quarter pole and gained ground quickly late. JUSTINTIMEFORWINE saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on
the inside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path headed into the far turn and weakened in the final furlong. MOMS MOON raced at
the back of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, angled in to save ground around the far turn and passed tiring horses in the lane. TRULY
MISCHIEF raced in the two path early, continued up the backstretch off the pace between horses, began to move up while racing in the four path around the
second turn and continued to improve position mildly while never threatening. KING RAMOS raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the leader
on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the three path and tired in the lane. RAISING MOON raced in the three and four path around
the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the four path and made no bid. CONSTANT
KNIGHT raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses, dropped back while saving
ground around the far turn and faded further from there. CALL BROS raced in the middle of the pack on the outside around the first turn and up the
backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path and was empty in the lane.
