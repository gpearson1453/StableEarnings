Footnotes
PARKERNESS saved ground around the turn while disputing the pace with DR. SNYDER then gradually drew off while kept to his business. STARSTREET
saved ground around the turn, remained along the inner rail in upper stretch, began to advance in mid stretch, altered course to the outside of DISPUTED
CLAIM approaching the sixteenth pole and rallied gamely. DISPUTED CLAIM stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled the turn three wide, had aim on
the leader in upper stretch, weakened and drifted in approaching the sixteenth pole. MR. HOUGHTON , off last, hugged the inner rail on the turn, eased out
to the three path in upper stretch and flattened out. OCCASIONAL MOON , three wide on the turn, was fanned four deep turning for home and failed to rally.
DR. SNYDER showed speed outside the winner for a half mile then steadily retreated through the stretch. MARYLAND MOON , no factor, raced outside
horses and was five deep turning for home. GAMING SOUL was outrun.

Footnotes
SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL prompted the pace two wide under nice rating and to the outside of RAVENEL, applied more pressure leaving the far turn, poked a
head in front after six furlongs, responded when asked nearing the lane and spurted clear of threats, opened up under right handed asks in mid stretch and
proved clearly best while remaining on her left lead. CONGRESS HALL , three wide between rivals early, was rated back a bit near the five eighths, angled
out and ranged up four wide to loom past the five sixteenths, saw the winner get away from her in upper stretch but kept on willingly to be clearly second
best. BEATUBYACHUBINOSE broke a step slow, was used four wide to contention, tracked three wide into the far turn, took closer order past the five
sixteenths, chased into the lane then faded in the final eighth. LOVE IS STRONG , fractious in the gate, came away in good order then was rated back off
the leaders heading into the first turn, drafted further back mid way through the backstretch run, angled out but lacked a solid response. RAVENEL took over
into the first turn and secured the inside, set a slow but pressured pace, ceded the lead past the five sixteenths, raced two wide into the lane and weakened.
SHEMADEMELUCKY , two wide stalking early, dropped in, failed to kick on past the three eighths and tired.

Footnotes
MYSTIC SEAPORT accelerated to the early lead, hugged the inner rail, opened up approaching the stretch then held sway under steady handling. GINGER
GIRL broke a bit awkwardly, circled the turn three wide and rallied nicely. HIDEWRIGHT AWAY , bumped and placed in tight quarters leaving the starting
gate, was two wide around the turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch, drifted in approaching the eighth pole and had a mild rally inside rivals. QUIT
QUAY , outside the winner while chasing that one around the turn, faded in the drive. SIX THE HARD WAY lacked speed, was in the two path mid way on
the turn, floated to the five path at the head of the lane and was not a factor. VOODOO PRIESTESS bumped HIDEWRIGHT AWAY when bearing in at the
break, failed to be a factor and was eased late. SPUN IN A MILLION , lightly bumped leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail chasing the pace to mid
turn, faltered and was eased late.

Footnotes
TRANSFER THE FUNDS settled well back off of a hotly contested early pace, angled out around the final turn, circled rivals six wide into the stretch, leveled
off under asking past the three sixteenths, sustained while laying in a few times and got up in the final jumps. GRAND MANNER disputed the pace to the
inside of DEJOHN through solid opening fractions, shook clear heading to the far turn then had to brace for an outside challenge from NO ME DIGAS, kept
that one at bay into the lane then opened up under a drive while on his left lead, wandered outward with a sixteenth remaining and got over to his correct
lead, kept on valiantly but just could not fend off the winner's charge. NO ME DIGAS , perched three wide off the embattled leaders, edged up and gave
hard chase of GRAND MANNER from the three eighths, saw that one get away in upper stretch, kept on grinding, cut back into the margin between foes in
deep stretch but was out finished. TRIPLE TITOS , off the duel while saving ground, remained inside into the stretch, made progress along the rail near the
sixteenth marker then flattened out. GOD IS LOVE broke a step slow, settled outside a rival, angled out and chased four wide between foes into the lane but
lacked a finishing response. BODE LYNX , well placed saving ground, gained some under a ride heading to the five sixteenths, angled out into the stretch,
lacked a further punch past the three sixteenths and faded. DEJOHN got into a battle outside GRAND MANNER around the first turn, carried that scrum to
about the half mile marker, failed to go on leaving the far turn and gave way.

OXIDE showed speed outside horses down the backstretch, circled the turn three deep, opened a clear lead entering the stretch, remained well off the rail
and prevailed under left had urging. PARADISE PRIDE , in hand waiting for room near the inner rail on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and
closed gamely outside foes. ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) lacked speed, moved up leaving the turn, was four wide entering the stretch, drifted in and flattened
out. NORTHERN THUNDER bore out leaving the starting gate, failed to be a factor and swung to the six path turning for home. SPOTTED BULL bumped
with SPEAK UNITY leaving the starting gate, chased the pace four wide around the turn and weakened through the stretch. BLAMEITONTHEFUN , no
factor, raced along the inner rail on the turn. BAHAMA CHANNEL prompted the pace racing between horses and weakened on the turn. NO MORE TALK
showed speed along the inner rail and gave way. SPEAK UNITY bumped SPOTTED BULL when forced out by NORTHERN THUNDER leaving the starting
gate, raced four deep on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ESPERANNNA vied into and around the first turn outside SHAOLIN, moved clear of that one past the seven eighths, early moved away under some rating,
widened the advantage leaving the far turn, came two wide into the stretch, kept on under a drive leaving the eighth pole, wandered outward late but had
plenty left to hold sway. MO FIRE settled off the pace, raced between rivals nearing the far turn, gathered steam and angled five wide into the stretch, drifted
briefly then straightened and closed steadily. VOICE OF SPRING , four wide the first turn, angled in while edging up nearing the far turn, briefly steadied
when trying to go through along the rail near the five sixteenths, stayed inside for the drive to make a mild run in mid stretch then flattened out. SHAOLIN
vied early to the inside of the winner, eased out and stalked through the backstretch, was under pressure pursuing into the lane and faded. IF THEN , four
then three wide early, dropped in through the backstretch then lacked a bid. REDWHITEANDTACOS , four then three wide stalking outside a rival, failed to
go on under pressure nearing the lane and faltered. NOTION INTERRUPTUS broke slowly, raced wide and failed to respond. STORMI CAT LADY was
outrun then eased through the lane. MISS COREY gave early chase, faltered leaving the far turn, drifted out in upper stretch and was eased late.

Footnotes
LEFT HAND THREAD , four deep leaving the backstretch, advanced three wide on the turn, secured command at the head of the stretch then drew away
under encouragement. RAGTIME RICHES , pinched back leaving the starting gate, was four deep around the turn and rallied. DIALER , three wide chasing
the pace into the turn, dropped back, swung out in upper stretch and failed to menace. HE'S PURE TALENT , no factor, swung to the four path turning for
home. MOONSET bore in leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail chasing the pace on the turn and was steadied on the heels of CHINNY TIN TIN in
upper stretch. FLOOR IT , fractious in the starting gate, was forced in by MOONSET at the start then was outrun. CHINNY TIN TIN bore in leaving the
starting gate, accelerated to the early lead, was taken to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, remained along the rail on the turn, faltered in upper
stretch and was eased.

Footnotes
BACKNTHEWOODS , six deep contesting the early pace, dropped in a few paths leaving the far turn with a short lead outside STEINBECK, shook clear mid
turn under some coaxing, kept on under left handed asks inside the furlong grounds and held firm with good energy through the wire. JOHN THE BEAR ,
four wide between runners disputing the early pace, bumped with a foe and rated back a touch near the turn, advanced four wide to loom into the lane, gave
hard chase from there and dug in gamely to preserve the place. KARAN'S NOTION , hard sent and battled inside five others through the opening furlong,
was shuffled back into the turn, trailed saving ground mid turn, angled out and came back gamely between runners. HOPEFUL TREASURE rated off the
embattled leaders early, edged up three wide past the five sixteenths, angled out for the drive and churned on. KADRI , with the early pace between foes,
bumped with JOHN THE BEAR nearing the turn, came back on between runners nearing the lane, gave hard chase in mid stretch and faded late. WAR
TOCSIN , five wide between horses and vying early, was lightly steadied nearing the turn, circled five to six wide into the stretch but came up empty.
STEINBECK , two wide between foes battling early on, inherited the rail leaving the far turn and stayed on to spar inside the winner, failed to keep pace
nearing mid stretch and faded. An objection by the rider of KADRI against JOHN THE BEAR for alleged interference nearing the turn was not allowed. An
objection by the rider of JOHN THE BEAR against the winner for alleged interference approaching the turn was not allowed.

VALIANT MAJESTY hugged the inner rail while disputing the pace around the turn, asserted her self turning for home and pulled away under a confident
hand ride. THUNDER BOSS stalked the pace three wide around the turn, was in striking position turning for home, gave way and passed a tired rival late.
LADY MOSLER stumbled leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the turn, swung wide turning for home and failed to rally. COFFEE BEAN , along the
inner rail most of the race, failed to rally. GINAMAYA disputed the pace outside the winner and tired in the drive. JAZZ TIME GIRL , under urging in the two
path mid way on the turn, gave way in upper stretch and was eased late. BLUE MOON BUNNY unseated her rider when taking a misstep mid way down the
backstretch. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run down the backstretch but no action was taken.
