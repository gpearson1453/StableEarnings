CREDIT RIVER was well placed early, rallied on the far turn three wide, closed determinedly and wore down his rivals. WAR NOVEL pressed the early
pace, rallied on the far turn and drew even, gained a slight lead in mid stretch, held well and just missed. CINDY'S STORM set the early pace, was hooked
at the quarter pole, held stubbornly on the rail through the stretch in a good effort. GOLD HERITAGE was allowed to settle early on the inside, angled out
four wide in the stretch and had a mild bid. AGNELLO'S DREAM had good position on the inside and went evenly late. GRAND DEAL allowed to settle,
failed to menace. BAD LITTLE BEAST was no factor.

early, steadied at the top of the stretch when NORTHERN JOURNEY angled out and went evenly late. DIAL AGAIN dueled on the lead and weakened in
late stretch. KISSTHECROSS dueled on the lead and tired quickly in mid stretch. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER VIEWING

Footnotes
OVERLOAD dueled on the lead the entire trip, prevailed by a narrow margin in a game effort. SPLENDID SPIRIT dueled with the winner, held gamely
throughout and just missed. RUNAWAY RUSSELL raced mid pack early, rallied in the stretch and closed willingly. NOSEY POWER was never far back, on
the inside, angled out four wide in the stretch and had a mild bid. GRANDE RED dueled three wide and weakened in the stretch. MUSIC GEM was
unhurried early, saved ground, and improved late. MY TICKET contended early and was through after a half. SOL OF VAQUERO was outrun. ALDUIN was
no factor.
