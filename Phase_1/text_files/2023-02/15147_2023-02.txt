the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled through the stretch. PERFECT PRINCESS was forced out leaving the gate, rounded the first turn about the
three path and bid past the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and dueled clear in second mid-stretch. BLONDE SAMARITAN settled
off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, angled out into the lane and came along for third mid-stretch.
ALL THE ENVY came away awkwardly and outward then rated the early pace inside, was pressured nearing the seven sixteenths pole, met approaching
the five sixteenths, dropped back into the far turn then faded at the rail. DETERMINED STELLA was forced outward and into Cowgirl Hop leaving the gate
then stalked two deep, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little more. COASTING TO WIN

Footnotes
MYSTIFIED settled off the early pace in the four path, saved ground on the second turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid approaching the three
eighths pole, raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, took the nod passing the eighth pole, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on. ROYAL
CRUSADER rounded the opening turn in the four path and settled off the pace from the seven eighths pole, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced at
the rail on the far turn, eased out toward the head of the lane, dug in to take second mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner. MY CANDY BIZ rated close
to the early pace about the three path, rallied to the lead past the seven sixteenths pole and drew clear leaving the three eighths, contested the edge at the
rail on the far turn, was caught passing the eighth pole and weakened the final sixteenth. MAKE WAY saved ground off the pace, started a bid nearing the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little in the lane. CHARITABLE SPENNY rated a slim lead inside, came under
pressure toward the seven sixteenths pole, was caught past the pole and weakened at the rail on the far turn. LIFESPAN rounded the first turn in the five
path, picked up the chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the four path of the far turn. AUTS REVOLUTION stalked the pace two
deep, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole but faded through the backstretch.
