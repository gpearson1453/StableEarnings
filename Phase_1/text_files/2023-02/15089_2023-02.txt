Footnotes
SHES A LUCKY REBEL broke outwardly from the gate while still being the fastest, grabbed the rail, set the pace, saved ground, urged to gain momentum
through the turn, kept the rail closed, was challenged by rival around the quarter pole while battling with that one, another rival passed along the outside,
shook the first one and went on to battle with the second challenger, matched strides down the lane was driven hard, and determinedly out finished all the
rest. LIGHTENING MO stalked the early leader while being rated just off the pace in the three path, shifted out into the four path in the turn, split horses
around the quarter pole, collared the first two at the three-sixteenth pole, was able to get past one of the early leaders, laid right next to the first leader where
they battled to the end. Gave a great effort but had to settle for the place spot today. CALLING was mid pack after the break, from in between horses,
angled out into the five path after the half mile marker, passed horses going into the turn while gaining momentum with every stride, moved to the rail spot
mid turn, saved ground until she had to come off the rail in the stretch as she caught the leader and launched her bid for the win, hooked the leader and was
within striking distance, had trouble switching leads and gave out a furlong too early, but was still able to run third. STARSNMOTION settled in the second
tier in a stalking position early, was allowed to get shuffled further back while saving ground, was being urged along to close ground, split horses at the top
of the lane, took advantage of the long stretch and out grinded the rest but was no threat to the first three. HOT GOLDEN GIRL was off a step slow, stayed
far back on the outside, continued to race wide, made one run and was able to out finish tiring rivals. MO SMOKING broke out at the start, traveled wide into
the turn, started running at the three eighths pole, ran gamely into and down the stretch, was within striking distance, had a glimmer of hope and then tired.
TWO JET broke sharp and vied for the lead early, matched strides with foe through the turn, flattened out in the stretch. ATALANTA ASTERIA never
involved.

Footnotes
COMPARATIVE stalked outside of the top pair, pressed into the far turn, bid turning for home, drew clear in upper stretch, flopped back to her left lead when
crossing left-over track marks from the starting gate at the sixteenth pole, and continued to pull away. SWEET CHABLIS took a light brush from an outer
rival at the start, set the pace two wide into the first turn, crossed over to the inside entering the backstretch, showed the way from a pair of pressers into the
far turn, met their bids turning for home, but proved no match for her widest challenger in upper stretch, and lasted safely for place. SONG BRIDGE tracked
in the two path, shifted four wide entering the lane, and stayed on, but failed to catch a tiring rival for place. AMISFIELD prompted along the inside into the
first turn, altered course outside of the leader while an outer rival applied pressure nearing the backstretch, pressed between horses before vying among
them around the far turn, but yielded at the quarter pole. PERSIMMON HILL tracked three to four wide around the first turn, but gave way after being floated
five wide entering the lane. CATHERINE BLAZE got outrun.

Footnotes
TAMBOURINE STAR settled far back three wide, fanned to the six path in upper stretch, rallied, bid outside of her entry-mate at the sixteenth pole, and
edged ahead. GUTZY chased along the inside, then outside of the top pair around the turn, rallied in the five path in upper stretch to bid at the furlong
grounds, led soon after, dug in gamely from rivals on either side in the final sixteenth, but was outkicked late. HARD FOUR tracked from the two path, took
aim inside of the leaders coming to midstretch, bid in the final furlong, but did not have enough. AUTUMNS STRONG MAN broke inwardly while off multiple
lengths slow, saved ground far back, improved entering the lane, and chased well for a minor share. HOLY BAYOU was anxious in the post parade, sped
clear early on, showed the way coming into the lane a bit off of the rail, and weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. LIL WOADIE trailed into the
turn, gained six to seven wide and outside of foes around the turn, then hung on his left lead and failed to menace. RISKTAKER lacked speed four wide and
between horses, and gave way. RELIC HUNTER stalked the clear leader from the three path, took aim entering the lane, but failed to change leads, and
weakened between horses in midstretch. FIELD OF VISION chased four wide, but weakened six wide entering the lane. PEANUT N IKE made little impact
two wide and between horses. GOTMY MO JO WORKIN lacked speed five wide, and faded.

Footnotes
MERLAZZA tracked along the inside, had her right hind heel clipped by an outer foe crossing the three furlong pole while visually unaffected, took aim
outside of the embattled pair in upper stretch, bid at the furlong grounds, and drove clear. ORNATELY set the pace inside of a pressing foe, sparred with
that one around the turn, shook free of him while getting outkicked by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, and kept on to prove second best. MYSTICAL
FIRE bobbled a bit at the start while still breaking towards the front, stalked three wide and between horses, chased under urging around the turn, failed to
keep pace with the leaders while drifting about in upper stretch, yet kept on in the final furlong to reach show at the wire. PERFECT WISH pressed two wide,
dueled around the turn, but yielded between horses in midstretch, and got nailed for show. CORSINI broke a step slow, raced far back two wide, and stayed
on. HUNTRESS FOR HIRE broke multiple lengths while bobbling, raced at the rear three wide, floated to the six path leaving the three furlong pole, then ran
on between rivals entering the final furlong. DESTINE TO RACE broke inwardly and bumped a rival at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, steadied
behind a troubled rival and fanned to the five path at the three furlong pole, and failed to factor. URBAN FORCE broke slowly, raced at the rear along the
inside, trailed while swinging out entering the lane, and moved up. SWEET SHILD O MINE tracked four wide, but weakened in the five to seven paths in
upper stretch. DARE TO WISH pursued from midpack along the inside, and faded. NEW BEAT took a bump from an outer rival at the start, raced forwardly
two wide and between horses, but took a bad step and clipped an inner rival's heel and almost lost her rider leaving the three furlong pole, then weakened
on her left lead.

Footnotes
BISHOPS BAY prompted the pace two wide, gained an advantage while well in hand at the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch, yet was roused
approaching midstretch as his stable-mate menaced, responded readily, and held firm. FIRST MISSION tracked in the three path, gained show between
horses into the turn, chased around the bend, took aim on his clear stable-mate from the five path in upper stretch, ranged up to bid in midstretch while
hanging on his left lead, but was kept at bay through the final furlong. BETTERA broke a step slow, laid off of the pace along the inside, sustained stride in
the three path in upper stretch, and stayed on in the four path in the final furlong to prove best of the rest. OCEAN CITY set the pace along the inside,
showed the way around the turn as the eventual winner applied pressure, but was headed by that well-traveling foe at the quarter pole, and weakened
approaching midstretch. QUATERNION lacked speed two wide despite rider's urging around the turn, fanned to the five path in upper stretch, and failed to
menace while hanging on his left lead. RIGHT KARMA bumped with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace three wide, fanned six wide entering the
lane, shifted inwardly and between horses in upper stretch, and improved. MOESAHANDFUL bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced at the rear along
the inside, and moved up between horses entering the lane. UXMAL chased three wide, came into the lane in the five path, and weakened. UNLOAD
chased along the inside, and faded. ST. JOHN'S trailed throughout.

LAKE LUCERNE took a light brush from an inner rival at the start, tracked three wide, was driven four wide around the far turn, came into the lane in the
seven path, got herded to the outer fence by inner rivals while ranging up in upper stretch, vied into the final furlong, and drove clear in the closing stages.
SOFT TOUCH stalked two wide, got outmoved by an inner rival around the far turn, came into the lane in the six path and between horses, got herded to
the outer part of the course while vying through upper stretch, but was outkicked by her outer counterpart entering the final sixteenth. TRAIL RIDGE ROAD
brushed with an outer foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, improved between horses in upper stretch in hopes of bidding inside of the
leaders in midstretch, but leveled off, and fended off an outer foe for show. RUSSIAN MAFIA brushed an inner rival at the start, raced far back four wide,
gained between horses approaching midstretch in hopes of taking aim inside of the leaders, but flattened out. CARPE VINUM bumped an outer rival at the
start, trailed while keen behind foes early on, swung from the three path to the seven path entering the lane, then shifted inwardly in upper stretch, but
lacked a bid. ISLAND HIDEAWAY (GB) tracked in the two path, slipped through inside of the leader entering the far turn to lead approaching the five
sixteenths pole, came into the lane in the five path, drifted out multiple paths in upper stretch as a pair of outer rivals menaced, and faltered in the final
furlong. MY PHILLY TWIRL tugged clear while remaining well off of the inside, but was overhauled by a rail bidder approaching the five sixteenths pole, and
gave way between horses. CLARA PEETERS (GB) bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, saved ground off of the pace, and faded.

Footnotes
BASELINE BEATER raced far back, awaited racing room in the three path while among foes turning for home, searched for clear sailing between horses
leaving the quarter pole, found it and split rivals at the three sixteenths pole, bid inside of the leading pair soon after, surged clear at the furlong grounds.
EARL OF DASSEL laid off of the pace in the three to four paths, rallied while fanning seven wide entering the lane, sustained a bid in upper stretch, but was
outkicked by his inner entry-mate at the furlong grounds, sparred for place thereafter, and narrowly prevailed. FIGHT'N READY tracked four wide, bid
entering the lane, led five wide in upper stretch, shifted out while meeting an outer bid in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner rival soon after, kept
on to duel for place through the final furlong, but got nailed. GAMETIME GLADIATOR bumped with an inner rival at the start, saved ground in midpack,
angled six wide entering the lane, but lacked a charge between horses. NEIGHBOR got antsy awaiting the start, then broke slowly while hopping a bit and
being put to crowded quarters at the start, trailed, saved ground around the far turn, smoothly shifted three wide in upper stretch to split foes, and stayed on
mildly along the rail. KIGALI stalked three wide, vied around the far turn, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the quarter pole, and gave way. DREAM
FORCE bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside while pocketed, but was blocked behind a wall of leaders entering the lane,
searched for racing room while shifting ground outwardly at the quarter pole, but never found it, and yielded. BIG COMMERCE bobbled a bit while taking
contact from rivals on both sides at the start, pursued from midpack two wide, but gave way in the four path and between horses around the far turn.
GUADALAJARA lacked speed three wide, took the far turn in the five path, and failed to factor while hanging on his left lead. WOODYTHEBIDSPOTTER
broke out to open space, pressed two wide and between horses, vied around the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch. SENSE YOU ASKED set the pace
along the inside, vied with a pair of outer bidders around the far turn, and weakened entering the lane.

DENINGTON laid off of the pace in the two path, launched a rally entering the lane, angled outside of the top trio at the furlong grounds, sustained his
charge to bid in the final sixteenth, and forged an advantage late. CAGLIOSTRO stalked along the inside, pursued from the pocket under a snug hold
around the first turn, took aim outside of the leading pair entering the lane, bid approaching midstretch, led at the furlong grounds, dueled with rivals on both
sides through the late stages, and got outkicked by an outer bidder late. TAPIT SHOES stalked two wide and between horses, secured pressing position
between the top pair at the eleven sixteenths pole, dueled inside of FIRST DEFENDER around the far turn after their inner counterpart faltered, fought on
gamely after being headed at the furlong grounds whilst inside of a trio of foes, but was bested. FIRST DEFENDER pressed the leader from the outside
while remaining a bit away from that one around the first turn, vied with a pair of inner rivals down the backstretch, dueled with only a single inner foe around
the far turn, but was outkicked by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, and yielded between horses in the final sixteenth. BANISHING tacked three wide,
stalked the top pair around the far turn, but was floated four wide entering the lane, and tired. HULLINAHURRY set the pace, showed the way from a pair of
pressers approaching the half mile pole, but weakened into the far turn. HUNTER'S DRIVE trailed early on, but sustained an injury nearing the half mile
pole, was pulled up, dismounted, and untacked within a sixteenth of a mile, and got vanned off.

EVAN SING stalked the top pair from the four path, fanned to the outer part of the course for better footing entering the lane, grinded on his left lead in
pursuit of the leader in midstretch, ranged up to bid entering the final sixteenth, and edged ahead. ANGASTON dueled for the lead outside of a rival while
taking the turn in the three path, floated to the eight path at the quarter pole, wrestled an advantage entering the final furlong, led to the sixteenth pole, but
was outkicked by an outer rival late. YANKEE SEVEN dueled for the lead inside of a rival while a path off of the fence, shifted out to the seven path entering
the lane to float his counterpart wider, but got headed by that foe at the furlong grounds, yielded, and staved off an inner rival for show. SURVEILLANCE
laid off of the pace in the four path, offered a grinding charge between horses approaching midstretch in hopes of menacing inside of the leaders, but
flattened out in the final furlong, and was kept at bay from reaching show. ICE CHOCOLAT (BRZ) saved ground while stalking, then chased in upper
stretch, and yielded through the final furlong. PYRON laid off of the pace along the inside, lacked a rail rally in upper stretch, shifted out in the final furlong,
and failed to menace. MANNY WAH tracked two wide and between horses, but gave way through the lane. ALL IN SYNC broke slowly, trailed in the three
path, came into the lane in the eight path, and made little impact.

Footnotes
PIONEER OF MEDINA tracked three wide, pursued under coaxing around the far turn, took aim on the clear leader from the five path in upper stretch, bid
along with an outer rival in the final furlong, dueled gamely between horses through the closing stages, and prevailed. MR. WIRELESS bobbled a bit at the
start while last away, laid off of the pace four wide, tracked around the far turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane, ranged up to bid for the lead leaving
the furlong grounds, battled with a pair of inner game rivals through the closing stages, but was staved off. RUN CLASSIC stalked outside of the clear leader
and from the four path around the first turn, vied in the two path with that foe into the far turn, gained an advantage at the seven sixteenths pole, showed the
way in the four path entering the lane, drifted in subtly as a pair of outer rivals menaced at the furlong grounds, battled with them through the late stages, but
was bested. HOIST THE GOLD set a clear pace in the two path around the first turn, got confronted by a rival at the half mile pole, was headed entering the
far turn, sustained pressing position around that bend, but gave way approaching midstretch. TAWNY PORT tracked along the inside, saved ground, shifted
out to the four path in upper stretch, and lacked a bid. KING FURY trailed in the four path, fanned to the seven path in upper stretch, and moved up. BIG
BLUE LINE tracked two wide and between horses, but only managed to chase entering the lane before fading. HAPPY AMERICAN rated at the rear two
wide and between horses, took the far turn in the four path before swinging to the six path entering the lane, but lacked a rally. FARMINGTON ROAD settled
far back along the inside, took the far turn in the three path, shifted to the five path in midstretch, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
TWO EMMYS set the pace in the two to three paths, shook away from outer rivals after shifting to the eight path at the quarter pole, and drew off with good
energy. GENTLE SOUL was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe while put to crowded quarters at the start, trailed along the inside, advanced in the
seven path and outside of rivals around the far turn, fanned to the ten path entering the lane, rallied while hanging on his left lead to bid for place at the
furlong grounds, gained that position in the closing stages, and held it. ENGLISH TAVERN took a bump from an inner rival leaving the gates, laid off of the
pace two wide and between horses, trailed into the far turn, fanned from the five path to the eleven path entering the lane, stayed on down the outer part of
the course in the final furlong, and reached show late. BAY STREET MONEY laid off of the pace three wide, chased under urging in the six path and
between horses around the far turn, came into the lane in the eight path, grinded away to bid for place along with outer rivals in midstretch, but was
outkicked in the final sixteenth. PIXELATE bopped the outer part of the gate with his head while leaving it, stalked in the four path, pursued from the five
path around the far turn, but lacked a bid before giving way. TIZ THE BOMB tracked along the inside, but gave way around the far turn. CAVALRY
CHARGE broke out and bumped a rival at the start, pressed two wide, then from the four path around the far turn, and weakened between horses through
the lane.

PRETTY MISCHIEVOUS stalked two wide and between horses, pressed inside of the leader approaching the half mile pole,, backed off entering the far turn
to switch outside of that one and to the four path leaving the three furlong pole, ranged up to bid in the five path entering the lane, battled through upper
stretch, wrestled an advantage at the furlong grounds, and subtly inched ahead late. MIRACLE broke a bit outwardly at the start, moved forward to set the
pace in the two path into the first turn, shifted out to the three path entering the backstretch, showed the way from chasers around the far turn, dug in in the
four path to resist PRETTY MISCHIEVOUS's bid entering the lane, sparred while getting headed in midstretch, fought on gamely through the final furlong,
but did not have enough to regain even terms. HOOSIER PHILLY bobbled before bumping an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace two wide and
between horses while under snug restraint behind foes around the first turn, shifted outside of rivals and to the five path at the three furlong pole, inched
closer while fanning to the six path around the far turn, but leveled off entering the lane, and secured show. VAHVA tracked along the inside, tugged down
the backstretch to striking range inside of the leaders at the nine sixteenths pole, but failed to sustain that position leaving the half mile pole, chased the
leaders while saving ground around the far turn, and yielded. CHOP CHOP was last away, shifted outside of foes, tugged forward four wide around the first
turn to press entering the backstretch, but came under urging between horses to keep pace turning in the five path turning for home, and gave way entering
the lane. KNOCKYOURSOCKSOFF took a bump from an inner rival at the start, lacked speed three wide, faded around the far turn, and was eased through
the lane.

Footnotes
ANGEL OF EMPIRE settled off of the pace in the two path, gained in the four to five paths and between horses around the far turn, sustained a charge after
changing leads between horses at the three sixteenths pole, bid at the furlong grounds along with an inner SUN THUNDER, battled with that foe in the final
sixteenth, and edged ahead. SUN THUNDER settled far back two wide, awaited racing room while loaded behind rivals turning for home, found clear sailing
two wide and between horses entering the lane, rallied to bid inside of the leaders at the furlong grounds, vied through the closing stages, but was outkicked
late. TWO PHIL'S bumped with an inner rival at the start, tracked from midpack two wide, moved forward down the backstretch, split foes to gain show at
the three furlong pole, took aim outside of the leading pair turning for home, bid for the lead in the four path entering the lane, led in upper stretch, but met
challenges from multiple rivals on either side in midstretch, and yielded leaving the sixteenth pole. TAPIT'S CONQUEST settled off of the pace two wide,
shifted out approaching the far turn, advanced in the seven path and outside of foes around that bend, sustained a grinding gain in upper stretch, but
leveled off at the furlong grounds. SINGLE RULER lacked speed along the inside, swung from the four path to the eight path entering the lane, and stayed
on willingly. HARLOCAP pressed two wide, vied around the far turn with a narrow advantage, but came into the lane in the three path before being headed
by an outer bidder in upper stretch, and yielded between horses at the furlong grounds. CRUPI broke slowly, failed to respond to heavy rider
encouragement in the early stages culminating with the rider checking for soundness nearing the wire for the first time, raced very far back two wide, cut the
gap on the rest of the field in upper stretch, and rallied greenly between horses leaving the three sixteenths pole. CURLY JACK bumped with an outer rival
at the start, raced in midpack along the inside, pursued two wide and between horses around the far turn, chased in the four path entering the lane, and
faded through the final furlong. VICTORY FORMATION stalked three wide, but was outmoved for show by an inner rival into the far turn, chased from the
four path around that bend, and weakened. SHAQ DIESEL stalked along the inside, chased under urging around the far turn, vacated the rail at the three
sixteenths pole, and weakened between horses. SILVER HEIST lacked speed three wide, and faded. PRIVATE CREED tracked four wide, but gave way in
the six path and between horses around the far turn. QUIET AS MIDNIGHT showed little. DETERMINEDLY set the pace along the inside under steady
coaxing, dueled around the far turn, caved entering the lane, and was eased through the final furlong.
