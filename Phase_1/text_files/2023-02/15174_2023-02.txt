Footnotes
INVECTIVE stalked in the two path, was coaxed along the inside around the far turn, tipped out to bid in the four path at the top of the lane, took the lead
just inside the final furlong, and held off an outer rival late to win. STORMY VICTORY was steadied going into the first turn, tracked in the three path, was
roused along the inside around the far turn, angled out to the five path into the stretch, and ran on for place. SIR SAMUEL settled off the pace along the
inside, was cued to move up between rivals in the two path around the far turn and was driven in the four path into the lane, and kept on in the final furlong
for show. THE BEST DISTANCE raced prominently in the three path, was roused into the far turn and floated out to the seven path into the stretch, and
finished evenly under right handed urging. FLATTER ME was in tight and checked while bumping with the inner rail early, moved up around the first turn to
prompt the pace in the two path, took the lead around the far turn and was driven from the three path into the stretch, but yielded in the final furlong. GOOD
SOLDIER bumped and checked between foes early, raced in midfield around the three path, was ridden along while swinging out to the seven path into the
stretch, but was one paced. CHEF MENTEUR set the pace along the inside, was roused into the far turn, and faded in the stretch. IMPULSIVENESS raced
wellback in the three path, was asked for more along the inside around the far turn, and was no factor in the two path down the lane. QUANTUM THEORY
bumped and had to steady early, raced in midpack in the four path, was cued in the two path around the far turn, tipped out to the six path into the stretch,
but never threatened. EUPHORIA STAR hopped at the start and was behind in the five path early, and never menace from the eight path in the stretch.
GLOBES rated in the three path but was empty in the four path in the stretch. LOVE ME ARCHIE raced off the pace in the five path but was never involved.
NO CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER AN INQUIRY WAS HELD BY THE STEWARDS TO LOOK AT THE ACTIONS OF MULTIPLE RUNNERS EARLY
AND INTO THE FIRST TURN.

Footnotes
JUNO SEA pressed the pace two wide between foes, took over nearing the quarter pole, dueled inside of ALWAYS CONNECTED from there to the wire
and prevailed. ALWAYS CONNECTED stalked the pace three wide, bid nearing the quarter pole, dueled outside of the winner from there to the wire and
was outfinished. SPONGER was bumped at the start, raced in range three and four wide, lacked the needed rally and was along for the show.
VELOCISSIMA set the early pace along the rail, could not match strides with the top two nearing the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch and
weakened. METAXA GRANDE went evenly inside. MARTHAMAYWHOVIER failed to menace while racing four wide. LOVE UNLIMITED was bumped at the
start, raced in the two path and never threatened. EMILIA'S LEGACY (PER) played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
SLIM SLOW SLIDER raced prominently from the four path into the turn, was cued to bid passing the quarter pole and tipped out to the five path into the
stretch, ran on to sustain that bid thru the stretch, and stuck her head in front just before the wire to get the winning photo. SONG RUNNER set the pace in
the two path into the turn, was roused approaching the quarter pole and floated out to the four path and was cued right handed to meet the challenge of an
outer rival entering the lane, dug in willingly through the lane, but was edged out late to place. UNIVERSAL PAYDAY was brushed by an inner foe leaving

Z FIRST raced prominently in the two path, bid while in hand around the far turn, took a narrow lead and was cued from the three path into the stretch, and
drew clear. STIR CRAZY tracked in the two path, was ridden around the far turn and tipped out to the five path into the lane, and ran on to get up for place
in a photo. AMAZIN QUEEN bumped with an inner foe at the start, was inside around the first turn and raced wellback in the three path down the
backstretch, was roused between rivals in the two path around the far turn and tipped back out to the three path for the stretch, and kept on between foes
into the final furlong but lost a photo for minor rewards to show. SPECTACULAR GAL was in the two path around the first turn and chased in the four path
down the backstretch, was cued in the three path into the far turn and under right handed urging while swinging out to the seven path into the stretch, and
stayed on. MANDY GREEN bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated along the inside around the first turn and was in the two path down the backstretch,
was roused along the inside around the far turn and tipped out to the two path for the stretch, and finished evenly between. SPIDER BELLE bumped with an
inner foe at the start, trailed along the inside into the far turn and was no factor from the five path in the stretch. TIZ IMPRESSIVE bumped with an outer foe
at the start, raced off the pace in the four path but flattened from the six path in the stretch. WINNING AT EASE stalked from the three path into the far turn,
floated out to the six path into the lane, and faded. BRAVO ZULU set the pace along the inside, was roused around the far turn and lost the lead to an outer
rival entering the stretch, and yielded in the final furlong. OCEAN AIR was held up off the pace in the five path early and was no menace from the seven
path in the stretch.

CONCRETE GLORY set the pace in the two path, was cued passing the quarter pole and opened up into the stretch, and held safe under left handed
urging. CARAMEL CHIP stalked along the inside early and was ridden into the turn, tipped out around the turn and took aim from the five path into the
stretch, and ran on for place. DANVILLE trailed along the inside, was roused around the turn and angled out to the three path for the stretch, and finished
evenly to get up for show. SUN VIKING tracked in the four path, ranged up in the three path around the turn, but flattened from the four path in the stretch.
FROSTED ARMOUR prompted the pace in the three path, tipped inside around the turn, but faded in the stretch. UNCORK THE BOTTLE chased in the five
path but was no menace.

Footnotes
CANDY MAN ROCKET tracked in the five path, ranged up while in hand and bid from the four path turning into the stretch, took the lead in upper stretch
and was cued right handed passing the eighth pole, drew clear, and was wrapped up late. UNCLE ERNIE chased in the six path, was driven from said
position into the stretch, and ran on for place. LIGHTENING LARRY prompted the pace in the four path and was roused while tipping into the two path
around the turn, was under left hand urging while shifting out to the five path into the lane, and evened out for show. CAJUN'S MAGIC rated in the three
path, was coaxed around turn, but was no factor in the stretch. SUPER OCHO (CHI) brushed with an outer foe at the start but recovered well to set the pace
in the three path into the turn was roused in the two path nearing the five sixteenths pole, but yielded passing the eighth pole. DOC AMSTER brushed with
an inner foe at the start, trailed along the inside around the turn and into the stretch, and was no threat. SCARAMOUCHE was nudged along from in range
in the two path into the turn but was empty in the seven path at the top of the stretch.

wide, angled five wide near the quarter pole and rallied outside. WONKA bobbled at the start, stalked the pace from the rail, tipped out in upper stretch and
was one-paced through the lane. LOVE HER LOTS settled off the pace while racing three wide, edged closer four wide around the far turn and finished
evenly. GOGO SHOES went evenly inside. LADY ARSINOE raced well back two wide, swung six wide in upper stretch and improved position. MAKIN MY

Footnotes
AMERICAN PRINCE broke out and bumped an outer foe at the start, prompted an inner pacesetter in the three path, bid in the four path nearing the quarter
pole and took the lead in the five path in upper stretch, was angled out passing the eighth pole to meet the challenge of an outer foe, and held on. GIANT
GAME had an awkward start and trailed in the five path early, moved up under rousing around the turn and was in the six path at the top of the lane, drifted
out after a left handed cue passing the eighth pole, and ran on for place. PRINCIPE D'ORO set the pace in the two path, was roused when challenged by an
outer foe nearing the quarter pole and cued right handed in the three path entering the stretch, but yielded inside the final furlong to show. MR TITO'S raced
wellback in the three path, was in the two path around the turn but got herded out the seven path into the stretch, and was one paced. ICE ROAD rated in
the four path, was urged right handed passing the quarter pole but got carried out to the eight path into the lane, and was no factor. DESERT RULER raced
off the pace inside but flattened in the stretch. TIGER raced prominently along the inside, drifted out to the eight path turning into the stretch, and was tired.
BOURBON CREED chased in the three path, was driven around the turn, but was empty entering the lane. JUDGE DAVIS got bumped by an inner foe at
the start, stalked in the five path but gaveway turning into the stretch.
