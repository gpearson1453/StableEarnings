BABY KRISTEN sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace, responded when challenged by MISS GLORIOUS with a
sixteenth to run and held that rival at bay late. MISS GLORIOUS was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn, checked in
mid-stretch and rallied late when clear. WHERE'S FRANKIE chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and gave way through the final furlong.
SINGLE LADY was off a step slow then allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn and failed to rally. LARIMAR settled off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ELDORADO DREAM showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved six-wide through the second turn ,could not gain on the winner in the drive but
was clearly second best. PASSED BY PAUL was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late.
BLUE AZUL disputed the pace while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. TELLER raced off the pacesetters early, saved ground
through the second turn and weakened. BOURBON TAN disputed the pace while racing three-wide, weakened after going a half and was eased.

prolonged drive but could not resist the winner late. YES PLEASE sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, responded when
challenged by TIME FOR GOLD nearing the quarter, vied with that rival and gave way grudgingly through a vigorous drive. LOOKIN SO LUCKY stumbled at
the break, lagged early, angled out with a sixteenth to run and finished with late interest.
