Footnotes
DUXONTHEPOND tracked from midpack along the inside, pursued from the two to three path around the turn, moved forward and between horses entering
the lane, rallied with a clear leader to catch in upper stretch, then drove past that one at the furlong grounds, and drew clear. SENATE DANCE rushed
forward after a flat-footed beginning to vie for the lead two wide, showed the way in the two path around the turn, shook free entering the lane, but failed to
obey multiple requests to change leads in upper stretch, offered little resistance to an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, and was clearly second best.
TWO HANDS FULL stalked the leader from the three path around the turn, but failed to progress while getting outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch,
chased while giving way through the final furlong, and saved show. SWEETASBAILY was severely pinched back when slammed by an outer rival into an
inner foe at the start, clipped heels with the latter in the aftermath, trailed along the inside, stayed on between horses while shifting from the three path to the
four path in midstretch, and narrowly missed reaching show. CORONA DEL MAR was prominent along the inside early on, rated back to stalk approaching
the turn, and faded. LA CHAPEAU took a solid bump from an outer rival knocking out her hind quarters at the start, had her back heels clipped by that foe
soon after, pursued from midpack four wide, then yielded while floated five wide entering the lane. HIGHER NOTE broke inwardly and squarely bumped a
rival at the start, lacked speed in the five path, then gave way in the six path while hanging on her left lead.

Footnotes
BEAUTIFULANDWILD brushed an outer rival at the start, settled off of the pace in the two path, gained between horses while tipping out turning for home,
spun into the lane five wide, sustained a rally to range up to the leaders entering the final sixteenth, and forged an advantage late. PAT HAND GIRL tracked
along the inside into the first turn, shifted course three wide and outside of rivals nearing the backstretch, inched closer to the leaders while under a drive
around the far turn, sustained a chase in pursuit of the clear pace setter through midstretch, produced a bid at the sixteenth pole along with an outer foe,
and got outkicked. ZEEROCK was brushed by an inner rival leaving the gates, vied along the inside, showed the way in the two path around the far turn,
shook clear entering the lane, held sway through midstretch while hanging on her left lead, but was collared by a pair of outer bidders a sixteenth from
home, and yielded. I DONT KNOW EITHER stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase on her left lead through the lane while lacking a bid.
KAITLYN'S COURT broke slowly and was slow to get going, trailed in the three path, advanced in the five path into the far turn, but was floated six wide
entering the lane, and failed to menace. CRAFTY PRINCESS saved ground towards the rear, but to no avail. STAR'S DREAM bobbled a bit while off slow,
recovered to prompt the pace four wide into the first turn, vied two wide down the backstretch, then from the three path around the far turn, but caved
between horses entering the lane. EYESEEMONEY prompted the pace two wide and between horses into the first turn, backed off to stalk exiting that back,
but weakened between horses into the far turn.

Footnotes
MAESTRIA bumped an outer rival at the start, vied two wide, drew clear turning for home, and inched further away under a confident hand ride through the
lane. LA FEME JOLIE vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner, failed to keep pace turning for home, then gamely clung to place from an outer rival
through the lane. CUSTOM DESIGN tracked from the three path, dueled for place through the lane, but was denied. MY LITTLE MIA took bumps from rivals
on both sides after breaking a touch slow, laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted out four wide in upper stretch, but only offered a mild kick.
CLASSICAL MAGNOLIA bumped an inner rival at the start, stalked from behind the leaders and from the two path, but lacked the needed kick to split foes
in upper stretch, then searched for racing room behind traffic through the final furlong. FOR REAL ALICE trailed in the three path, and got outrun.
GRACELEADSUSHOME lacked speed in the four path, and tired.

Footnotes
HONEYSUCKLEDELIGHT stalked behind the leaders, but got rank while pulling just down the backstretch, steadied along multiple times approaching the
turn, tipped three wide to take aim while among foes turning for home, but bore out to the seven path entering the lane, yet sustained a grinding charge
while hanging on her left lead, vied in the final sixteenth, and prevailed. VISIONISTA laid off of the pace along the inside, smoothly tipped three wide
entering the lane to take aim on the leader, but lacked the needed kick in upper stretch, ranged up to the tiring pace setter entering the final sixteenth to bid
along with an outer rival, but got outkicked. TWO JET prompted the pace two wide, vied into the turn, led at the three furlong pole, cleared in upper stretch,
but tired as a pair of foes closed in entering the final sixteenth, and gave in late. THE CALLING STONE reared and tossed his rider when approaching the
starting gate, but was quickly gathered and loaded rider-less, lacked speed in the four to five paths around the turn, fanned to the ten path entering the lane,
and ran on willingly. PICKIN ANA GRINNIN broke outwardly, stalked three to four wide, but was floated to the eight path by an inner rival, and faded shortly
after. DIVINE DEFENCE set the pace inside of a vying rival, but was headed at the three furlong pole, and weakened in upper stretch. BOSTON MILLIE
pursued from midpack while hung in the five to six paths around the turn, and weakened nearing the lane. SANGIOVESE showed little.

Footnotes
EL DEAL ME ACES stalked the run-away leader from three path around the turn, closed in turning for home to take aim in upper stretch, ranged up to bid at
the furlong grounds, and edged clear thereafter. CALICOCO tracked two wide and between horses, then chased an outer bidder through the lane, and
gained place late. GEAUX SUGAR tugged clear, ran off to a wide margin down the backstretch, but began to tire turning for home, was caught at the furlong
grounds, and steadily gave way. GOLDENLUTE was bumped by an outer rival into an inner foe at the start, raced well back in the three path, fanned to the
six path entering the lane, and stayed on willingly while hanging on his left lead. J B GRAY broke out a touch at the start, tracked along the inside, but failed
to sustain that position leaving the three furlong pole, and yielded. SONO broke in and bumped a rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the three path,
then gave way between horses in the five path in upper stretch. CROSSING IRIS took a bump from an outer rival at the start, trailed in the three path, and
got outrun.

Footnotes
DEMOLITION DUKE broke a step slow and raced far back early on, launched a four wide rally around the turn, sustained his advance to loom a danger in
pursuit of his clear stable-mate in upper stretch, drove past that foe approaching the final sixteenth, and kicked away with good energy. BO CRUZ lacked
speed two wide and between horses, swung out to the six path entering the lane, and rallied to gain place late. CHARGING set the pace along the inside,
shook free entering the lane, dug in to resist his stable-mates bid leaving midstretch, but proved no match approaching the final sixteenth, gave way, and
lost place late. RUSH CENTER was reluctant to load, then failed to keep pace with the group after breaking midpack, was outsprinted to trail early on,
shifted out to the five path while picking up stride in midstretch, and offered a late kick for a minor share. DREAMBOAT laid off of the pace three wide,
turned for home among foes, but failed to change leads through midstretch while chasing one-paced. HEY JACKSON stalked two wide, pressed around the
turn, but failed to keep pace in the three path entering the lane, and tired. AMERICA TOUGH tugged along the inside to a stalking position behind the leader
after the opening stages, settled into stride into the turn, stalked around the bend, but only managed to chase in upper stretch before weakening at the
furlong groudns. CLASSIC DANCER broke outwardly, chased two wide under strong urging early on, but failed to keep pace into the turn, and faded
between horses turning for home. PAPPA'S DREAM hopped slightly while off a step slow, saved ground in midpack, but faded.

Footnotes
BEAUTIFULNAVIGATOR (IRE) tracked two wide, bid along with an inner rival entering the lane, inched clear three wide in upper stretch, and fended off an
inner bidder through the final furlong. FLOWERDEW saved ground in midpack, split rivals two wide in upper stretch to bid for the lead inside of the leader
leaving the furlong grounds, but was kept at bay, then saved place. MO SHIRO laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, then chased three wide
while among foes and behind the leader through midstretch, stayed on well to miss reaching place. DESERT TEMPEST laid off of the pace three wide,
tracked around the far turn, fanned five wide in upper stretch, then chased the leaders home while one paced. SOULTITLESREADY took a mild brush from
an inner rival at the start, laid unhurried in the two path, trailed outside of a rival into the far turn, fanned six wide in midstretch, and moved up.
SUMMEROSA leaned outwardly while off slow, brushed and shied from an outer rival in the aftermath, trailed along the inside, and never got involved.
WATCH THIS MUNNY stalked along the inside, bid entering the lane, but weakened approaching midstretch. TORREY (IRE) dropped her rider stepping
onto the track, but was quickly re-mounted, remained fractious pre-race, sped clear while staying wide through the lane for the first time, showed the way in
the six path around both turns, but tired around the far bend, got swallowed up by inner rivals entering the lane, and stopped.

Footnotes
MR. CROMWELL pressed four to three wide, cleared entering the lane, and held sway. SYVESTAR broke a bit out, tracked from off of the pace in the three
path, then rallied to claim place in upper stretch, and chased the leader home to prove second best. INSPECTOR ED tracked in the three to four paths
around the turn, fanned six wide entering the lane, stayed on, flopped back to his left lead at the furlong grounds causing him to lug in, and was best of the
rest. COMPUTERIZED broke a bit out, saved ground far back, and sustained a rail charge. HARPES HILL set the pace inside of a pair of pressers into the
turn, but weakened in upper stretch. INDEFENSIBLE TOWN broke a step slow, trailed in the three path, and made little impact. CHIPEEE raced forwardly
two wide and between horses before rating back nearing the turn, chased from the two to three paths around the turn, swung five wide entering the lane, but
tired on his left lead. CHAD'S FLASH prompted the pace three to two wide and between horses, but weakened entering the lane.
