ZOEY dueled for the lead outside, made a three wide bid leaving the turn and gained a short advantage leaving the furlong marker but could not hold off the
winner late, missed. MISS CONVEYOR dueled for the lead on the inside and dug in gamely in the drive but was outfinished late. MOVING IN STEREO
steadied after the start, advanced on the inside on the turn, eased out by the quarter pole and came four wide into the lane and had no rally. PLATINUM
PROMISE was well placed on the inside and weakened in the lane. TILTED TIARA lacked a rally. PROTECTTHEWITNESS was settled three wide and
dropped back on the turn.

advantage to the wire. HUSHEMUP stumbled at the start, chased the pace four wide, made a mild bid three wide on the turn and then failed tom gain late,
saved place award. SKIPOVER was reserved early on the inside, advanced on the turn and was three wide by the quarter pole, then had a mild late rally to

stalked the pace three wide and weakened the final quarter. LET UR LIGHT SHINE failed to menace. CEETA was well placed on the inside and tired.

Footnotes
JUST GOT STARTED set the pace on the inside and then drifted out a tad nearing the furlong marker and then drew clear in the furlong grounds to prove
best under a drive. WILD VINE stalked the winner three wide but lacked the needed winning bid in the lane while saving the place award. MITROPANOS
was rated along early and made a four wide bid on the turn but flattened out, bested rest. SUNSHINE JACK tracked the pace on the inside and weakened.
NECCO was bumped at the start, chased the pace in between rivals and weakened. TORRID was settled on the inside and lacked a rally. SKIMBLE
SHANKS was settled early, four wide on the turn and had no rally.

ASLUCKWOULDHAVIT set the pace while clear while off the rail, remained clear on the turn and was two wide into the lane, then held sway late to prove
best under a drive. VOUCH was allowed to settle early, closed well on the inside to be clearly second best. ECONOMIC POWER chased the pace and
made a mild four wide bid on the turn but needed more late. JAYJAYDEE chased the pace in between rivals, then shuffled back on the urn and came six
wide into the lane and improved position late. PERUVIAN BOY was bumped at the start, settled early, dropped to the inside on the turn and had a belated
rally. DON'T DARE ME chased the pace and made a mild bid five wide on the turn but flattened out. ORASHI was off a step slow, came wide into the lane
and lacked a rally. SPIKES SHIRL chased the pace and was between rivals by the quarter pole and weakened. MOJAC KAT tracked the pace on the inside
and stopped.

Footnotes
CHRIS AND DAVE pressed the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command, took over nearing the furlong marker and edged away to
prove best under a drive. RAPID RESPONSE set a pressured pace on the inside, then dueled with the winner by the quarter pole, held place award late.
FLAT OUT FLASHY chased the pace and made a inside bid leaving the turn but needed more, got nod for the show award. PAPA TONY was rated early
between rivals, boxed on the turn, found room leaving the furlong marker and finished willingly to just miss the show award. LITERALLY was reluctant to
load, rated between horses, ridden along and made a mild bid four wide on the turn but had no late kick. BIG BAD BUD stalked the pace four to five wide
and then was empty in the drive. MR. SKITTLES failed to menace.
