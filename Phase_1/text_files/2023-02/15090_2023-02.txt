three deep. FEROCITY showed good early speed to set the pace, dug in from the inside and finished gamely to the wire. SHWEET PERSUASION tracked
the early leader from the inside, angled to four path near the three sixteenths pole and kept on to the wire. STAGE DOOR dropped back off the early pace,
raced two to three deep and had no late response. YHA YHA settled off the early going, raced near the inside and never threatened. RUN FOR MATTY
raced far back and never menaced.

while racing three to four wide. JOEY'S VALENTINE pressed the pace while racing between and had not enough in the drive. FOR REEL hustled early,

Footnotes
MY BOY GUS was quick to begin to set his own pace and held gamely to remain clear under strong handling. SCOOTER'S BOY was unhurried early on,
moved up four wide through the stretch run and got up for the place position. THAT'S D 'CAT stalked the pace, raced two to three wide and moved up late
to improve position. PRAIRIE SQUALL tracked the pace from the inside and weakened. FALCON HEAVY stalked the pace and weakened. ALARM
SYSTEM settled off the early going, raced three wide and had no response. BREAK FREE dropped back early and failed to respond.
