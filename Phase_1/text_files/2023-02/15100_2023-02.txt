Footnotes
UPWARD MOBILITY raced up close outside the pacesetter, challenged at the three-eighths pole but failed to keep alongside on the turn, chased two wide
into the lane, re-bid in upper stretch and took over at the eighth pole, then drew away under right-handed urging. OLD PAL was off slow and steadied
behind rival at the start, trailed two wide into the turn, steered out and went four wide into the stretch, angled out wider in the lane and closed well to get up
for second. BOTH AT FAULT stalked off the rail, chased two wide into the lane, drifted out in upper stretch, steadied behind COUNTRY BOY who came out
in midstretch, finished determinedly late but lost the place. COUNTRY BOY took control early and set the pace up the backstretch, got pressured at the
three-eighths pole but quickly moved clear again, challenged again by UPWARD MOBILITY in upper stretch, could not withstand the pressure and
relinquished the lead with a furlong left to run, ducked out under left-handed urging midstretch and flattened to fourth. SHIP AND SCAM got crowded
between rivals early, bobbled crossing onto the dirt, tracked three deep then outside a rival, spun three wide into the lane, got floated out a bit in upper
stretch and could not rally. STAN FROM MALIBU pulled early along the inside off the pace, saved ground to the stretch and lacked a rally. TOPPERS
WAGER broke slow, went between rivals then had to steady when boxed in at the nine-sixteenths pole, steadied again into the turn, raced a bit off the rail
into the stretch and failed to menace. BUCK OWENS got shuffled back early, rounded the bend three wide and proved no menace.

Footnotes
PIROLI stalked the pace from inside, moved out and went between while alongside the leader in the middle stages, took over past the three-eighths pole,
cleared late on the far turn and widened under right-handed urging and steady handling late. GOLDENEYE sped to the front and took control of the rail,
showed the way inside a pair of rivals to the far turn, was overtaken by PIROLI after crossing the three-eighths pole, stayed alongside then lost touch past
the quarter marker and churned on through the lane to best the rest. AMERICAN REFUGEE broke a step slow on the outside, chased three wide early, four
deep in the middle stages, continued in the four path on the far turn, grinded out the final furlong and edged CANELO for the show honors. CANELO
stumbled leaving the gate, recovered quickly and was forwardly placed two wide, traveled three deep up the backstretch, put in a mild bid outside inner pair
on the far turn but could sustain the challenge, chased three to four wide into the lane, weakened in the furlong grounds and got edged for third. CAISSON
got crowded leaving the gate, trailed two wide early, traveled along the rail then two wide leaving the far turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
CATALINA EDDY set the pace inside a trio of rivals, maintained a short advantage through the turn, shook free at the top of the lane and held safely under
urging. MY RANSOM stalked the top quartet from inside into the turn, saved ground through the bend while inching closer, moved off the fence in the drive
and finished determinedly for second. MOON ICE forwardly placed four deep up the backstretch, chased three deep into the lane and churned on for a clear
third. FINALLY AN EDDIE pressed the pace from between rivals, remained outside the leader through the turn, could not kick on with CATALINA EDDY at
the top of the stretch and weakened. THE O G raced outside a rival at the back into the turn, was along the two path through the bend, moved out in the
lane and failed to menace. TRANSITORY raced up close three deep and between rivals, got put in a bit tight around the bend, angled into the two path and
weakened in the drive. MY DAD IS THIRSTY hit the gate and came away slow, bobbled crossing onto the dirt, trailed while a bit green, traveled inside a
rival into the turn, saved ground around the bend and was never a factor.

Footnotes
BIG SWITCH pressed the pace from outside early, raced on even terms at the half-mile pole, inched clear around the far turn and drew off. ROSE MADDOX
broke a step slow, stalked behind the leader from the rail, went two wide into the far turn, had to wait when boxed in from the three-eighths pole to the
five-sixteenths marker, moved out and launched a bid three wide into the lane but was no match for the winner in the final furlong. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH
got blocked three wide behind a rival on the first turn, angled inward racing at the rear on the backstretch, ridden along through the far turn and steered out
to entered the lane four wide and was along for the show. MICRO SHARE broke a step slow, steadied off behind a rival early, settled inside, moved out and
went outside the top pair on the backstretch, chased three deep under coaxing on the far turn and faded down the lane. MANORELLI took control early from
the rail, set the pace under pressure then dueled with four furlongs remaining, lost command and could not keep up with the winner past the five-sixteenths
pole, then gave way in the stretch run. AQUA JULIA chased two then three wide early, raced widest up the backstretch then angled into the two path
nearing the far turn, angled over to the inside around that bend and tired.

Footnotes
HARPER'S GALLOP broke out and brushed rival, sprinted to the front while tugging early in hand, controlled the pace to the far turn, pressured at the
five-sixteenths pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safely. ALOHA KITTEN stalked the pace from inside, cut the corner into the lane, tipped off the
fence and finished willingly but had to settle for second best. KUORA (PER) got brushed and floated out leaving the gate, pulled a bit between rivals first
time in the stretch, was closest in pursuit in the two path up the backstretch, challenged from outside on the far turn, lost touch with the winner in upper
stretch and flattened to third. WHISTLER'S STYLE was off a bit slow in the beginning, sat off the pace on the inside, went two wide around the far turn and
kept on for minor award while never threatening. TIZNO'S DILEMMA pulled early in the two path then tipped three wide around the clubhouse turn, rounded
the far turn four wide, drifted out a bit from the left-hand in upper stretch and failed to menace. VANDALIA bobbled a bit and outward at the start, tracked in
the two path early, went three deep around the far turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
WEGONAHAVAGOODTIME pressed between rivals early, dueled inside MASTERMIND approaching the quarter pole, shook free in upper stretch and drew
off. TENTH STREET DON was off slow to begin, lacked room at the three-eighths pole, tipped out into the stretch, closed while angling back inside and got
up for second. LEMON DROP SHOT sat off the pace early on, went three wide into the turn, moved out and came five wide into the lane, finished well in the
furlong grounds but got outkicked for second. MASTERMIND raced up close three deep, challenged around the turn and dueled outside the winner into the
stretch, lost command at the top of the lane and flattened in the furlong grounds. IRONDALE bumped leaving the gate, raced off the pace four deep into the
turn, continued wide into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick to threaten. HONEYMOON SUITE leaned back at the start but recovered quickly to
only lose a step, set the pace inside a pair of rivals to the turn, lost command at the three-eighths pole, could not keep up with outside pair around the bend
and weakened in the drive. CURLY ESA stalked the top trio from inside, exited the bend two wide, moved inward in the lane and weakened. SHADY STAR
was off slow and bumped with inner rival leaving the gate, trailed three wide into the lane and passed tired rivals. VALIENTE raced off the pace and moved
inside, steered out in upper stretch and was not a factor. MEMORANDUM chased between early then off the rail in mid-pack, got blocked near the
five-sixteenths pole, angled inside, altered out from behind rival in upper stretch and was not persevered with in the furlong grounds. HYDRO FROST broke
out and bumped rival, tracked two to three wide on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
FAYETTE FOX took control early from the rail position, controlled the pace with a rival to the outside, cleared with three furlongs remaining, showed the way
along the inside into the stretch, showed the whip then urged right-handed at the sixteenth pole and held well. LUMINIFEROUS bumped with CALIFORNIA
BLING before the first turn, tracked inside then steadied at the five-eighths pole, went between runners following the incident, angled four wide on the far
turn, came three wide into the stretch, put in a late run but ran out of time. CHEEKIEST stalked in the two path early, moved out three deep on the
backstretch, took aim three then two wide leaving the far turn, could not summon the needed late kick in the furlong grounds but kept on to hold the show.
CALIFORNIA BLING got crowded between rivals shortly after the start, bumped and lost her path nearing the first turn, raced along the inside then got put in
tight by outer rival at the three-eighths pole, tipped out on the far turn and angled out further into the stretch, put in a mild rally and rounded out the
superfecta. MOUNT MARY (IRE) stumbled at the start, rated on the inside behind the pacesetter, coaxed along on the far turn and faltered in deep stretch.
TENACIOUS LADY threw her head, brushed the gate and bumped with outer rival at the start, settled in the two path, angled in on the far turn, steered out
at the top of the stretch and lacked a rally. CAMERON SLOUGH bumped leaving the gate, traveled in the two path early, moved out on the far turn then got
floated out into the stretch and failed to menace. ANACARAVA (IRE) was closest in pursuit early then prompted the pace from outside, lost contact at the
three-eighths pole, started to weaken between rivals and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
TEDDY'S BARINO attended the pace outside the dueling pair, challenged around the turn and inched ahead at the quarter pole, kicked clear into the stretch
and remained unchallenged to the wire. ADARE MANOR stalked the speed off the rail, driven three to four wide into the stretch, finished determinedly but
could not reach the winner. IRONIC TWIST stumbled and bumped with AIN'T EASY at the start, went up to battled that rival for command while getting
brushed early, fought between rivals around the turn, could not kick on with the winner into the lane, flattened in the furlong grounds but saved the show.
UNA CHIQUITITA (CHI) raced in range wide up the backstretch, navigated the turn four wide and lacked the needed response. AIN'T EASY bumped
leaving the gate, drifted out and brushed IRONIC TWIST while dueling with that rival for command, vied with outside pair around the turn and weakened in
the drive. MALIBU MARIE dropped back early, went three to four wide on the turn and was not a factor. CLASSICAL ROMANCE raced along the inside into
the turn, entered the stretch two to three wide and failed to menace.

Footnotes
FREEDOM FLYER sprinted clear early, angled over to the rail on the turn, pressured from a pair of outside rivals around the bend, cleared again in upper
stretch and held gamely in the end. BIG SUMMER settled outside a rival at the back early, went two wide into the turn, angled out crossing over the dirt,
closed three deep late but could not get by. BAY STORM got bumped by STELLA NOIR while forwardly placed early, went four wide into the turn, bid three
deep around the bend, lost touch with FREEDOM FLYER in upper stretch, then came again between rivals late and finished a game third. COUNTESS
ROSINA (IRE) stalked off the rail then angled in on the turn, saved ground to the lane, found traffic in upper stretch, moved off the fence but could not find
room late. LADY JAE unhurried in the early going, got blocked behind COUNTESS ROSING (IRE) nearing the turn, lacked room while along the fence
around the bend, went tow wide into the lane, steered out in upper stretch and could not rally. STELLA NOIR raced up close to the inside of the pacesetter
early then came out and bumped BAY STORM, went three wide into the turn, bid between rivals around the bend and weakened in the stretch run.
