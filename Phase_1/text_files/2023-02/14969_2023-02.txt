Footnotes
HORNBEAM vied briefly outside, took over before half a mile, repelled a challenge nearing the stretch and was kept to a drive. SAINT MARCO settled
inside, angled out on the final turn and gradually closed the gap. TOUGH WORKOUT stalked the pace outside, bid at the quarter pole then weakened.
LUCKY MUCHO MAN trailed inside for half a mile then passed rivals while no threat. SENSIBLE JIM earned a narrow lead inside then gave way before half
a mile. SPEIGHT'SPERCOMETE lacked speed three wide and was never a factor. LUDO dropped back early and was never in contention. EXCLUSIVE
ORDER raced within range along the rail then stopped abruptly. OUTWORKNFORAKISS pursued the pacesetters three wide early then faltered.

Footnotes
MARIANNA QUEEN stalked close up two wide, bid entering the far turn, took charge, drew clear, responded to some mild urging in upper stretch, then was
ridden out. ABHAILE tracked on the inside, advanced on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied, could not threaten the winner and remained
clear for the place spot. ELUSIVE RYDER trailed the field, moved up inside on the far turn, angled out, rallied mildly outside and was along for the show
spot. BOOM BOOM GIRL set the pace on the inside, chased the winner on the far turn, weakened in the lane and lost third late. CREEDIBILITY raced off
the pace inside and failed to threaten. LULA'S ROADRUNNER raced six wide early, chased outside, chased on the far turn and faded. ANGEL RAPHAEL
raced five wide early, settled off the pace between rivals and gave way. LADY BREXIT raced four wide early, settled three wide off the pace and gave way.

OUTRAGEOUS BET stalked the pacesetters outside, bid into the stretch then wore down the leader in the final eighth and pulled away. ARTISTIC
REASON prompted the pace outside, took over into the stretch, edged clear then weakened. RELISHMENT settled wide, advanced on the final turn then
flattened out. LOOK OUT LAMBO saved ground close up, was put to urging on the final turn but faltered. KITTEN STREET hustled to the front early, led off
the rail, was collared and proved empty in the lane. WEEKEND IN COURT lagged far behind then caught fading rivals late. THE ANGRY MAN chased
within range briefly inside then gave way readily. MY MAN ELVIS lacked speed and was never in contention.

Footnotes
HE RUNS THE LINE tracked on the inside, advanced on the far turn, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied between rivals, drifted out at the sixteenth
marker brushing WILL TAKE CONTROL, then dug in gamely to the wire and held determinedly. WILL TAKE CONTROL steadied a bit entering the first turn,
raced off the pace inside, angled out entering the stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong, was brushed by the winner at the sixteenth pole and continued
gamely outside to the finish. TURNS vied two wide for the lead, dueled on the backside and far turn, dug in gamely in the stretch drive and held well for the
show spot. MIDNIGHT TRICK raced three wide early, settled two wide off the pace, closed belatedly and got up for fourth. KITH vied inside for the lead,
dueled on the backside and far turn, dug in to midstretch and weakened. DRONE SWARM raced four wide early, then close up three wide, chased outside
on the far turn, made a mild bid at the quarter pole and weakened. ILOVECHARLYBROWN raced off the pace, chased on the far turn and lacked a rally.
EDDIE'S CHARGE was outrun. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run, along with a Jockey's Objection by the rider of WILL TAKE CONTROL against
the winner, the race was declared official.

NEIGH DUDE settled just off the pace, bid three wide, took over near the five sixteenths pole and drew away while kept to urging. HEALY'S HOPE far back
early, advanced inside with good late energy while no threat to the winner. TEXAS BASIN raced off the leaders inside, angled out in the stretch with a mild
bid. E T'S CANDY MAN prompted the pace outside, moved with winner on the turn then faded. MAHOMES MONEY hustled to the front inside, was collared
midway on the turn and gave way. PEDERSON'S COURAGE chased three wide down the backstretch then moved extremely wide into the lane.
CHAMPION BY DESIGN flashed speed outside and began fading on the turn. ONE SLICK START lacked speed, moved wide and was never a factor.
SPLITZVILLE dropped back after the start and trailed throughout.

HOP ON ME dueled for the lead in the two path, led at the quarter pole then edged away under moderate pressure. ELEVENMONTHSLATER steadied
repeatedly to the final turn, angled out to secure room and rallied to be second best. DIVINARY earned a narrow advantage inside, dueled through the final
turn and weakened. FLIRTING prompted the pace three wide to the stretch and faltered. THEARCHERORTHEPREY chased wide throughout and lacked a
rally. TEMPTED TO TOUCH saved ground close up for half a mile and faded. PRECIPICE broke slowly and dropped back inside and was never a factor.
TEMPEST RISING was fanned very wide on the first turn then gave way.

SPEEDY BOLT raced between rivals off the pace, moved five wide to secure room on the turn then edged ahead and lasted in a steady drive. DOCTOR
DOOM trailed early, moved extremely wide on the turn and into the stretch and finished strongly. MIDLANER stumbled at the start, rushed up to duel inside,
led then weakened late. ET'S MOON MAIDEN settled inside the dueling pacesetters, angled out in the stretch and continued willingly. TYCOON advanced
six wide on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. RUFFY prompted the pace four wide, reached near even terms at the quarter pole and faltered. YO
NESSROUNDONKERN saved ground off the pace and was never involved. BACKATYA earned a narrow advantage early in the two path then began
fading on the turn. MEGA CHARLIE prompted the pace between rivals to the three eighths pole and stopped.

Footnotes
SENSE A MILLION raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the turn, angled out, rallied outside, closed willingly to take command and pulled away under
urging. BROAD JUMPER had a shoe repair in the paddock, raced four wide off the pace, moved up at the quarter pole, rallied outside and finished well for
second. VALUABLE BREIGH set the pace while being pushed along early, shook free entering the turn, dug in gamely in the stretch run and held on for
third. GIA'S FUEGO raced two wide off the pace, chased on the turn and finished evenly in the lane. CAJUN COUSIN bobbled at the break, pressed the
pace in the early stages, chased two wide on the turn and weakened. BLUNT FORCE steadied at the start, raced off the pace between rivals, chased two
wide on the turn and lacked a rally. HIGHTIME VALENTINE raced three wide off the pace, chased outside on the turn and tired. JUST STAY HOME raced
off the pace with an inside trip and was outrun. RISQUE'S JEWEL stumbled at the start, raced three wide off the pace and gave way.
