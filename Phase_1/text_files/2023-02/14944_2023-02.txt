Footnotes
ICY REPLY sped clear leaving the backstretch, set the pace along the rail around the turn and lasted under urging. IF THEN lacked speed, was near the
inner rail leaving the turn, swung to the six path near the eighth pole and rallied outside foes. MO FIRE , four deep around the turn, advanced to the eighth
pole, raced on her left lead in the drive and weakened. NOTION INTERRUPTUS trailed for a half mile, raced in the five path in upper stretch and flattened
out. CAUSE TO DREAM stalked the pace in the three path around the turn and gave way in the drive. PREPAREFORTAKEOFF , fractious in the starting
gate, showed speed along the inner rail, eased out leaving the backstretch, chased the pace in the two path around the turn and tired. RAISE YOUR GAME
hugged the inner rail chasing the pace around the turn and gave way in mid stretch.

Footnotes
THE THINKER settled off the pace while saving ground, angled out and was put to some asking leaving the far turn, circled four wide with momentum into
the lane, closed in steadily under a drive and took control outside rivals in the final strides. SECRET SANCTUARY , bumped at the break, rated forwardly
while four wide past the three quarter pole, edged up three deep in hand and took the lead nearing the far turn, sparred outside WIRED IN leaving the five
sixteenths, moved clear into the lane, wandered outward under left handed asking in deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. WIRED IN came out a bit at the
break and bumped with a rival, prompted the pace two wide, bid between foes near the half, battled inside SECRET SANCTUARY around the final turn,
angled out when that rival cleared approaching the lane, steadily came back on under a drive leaving the furlong grounds, challenged between foes then
steadied when put in tight near the wire. I'M NOT A BABY , well placed off the leading trio into the far turn, saw two rivals get away leaving the three eighths,
shifted out and made up some ground late. SWALLOW BEACH , four wide into the backstretch, was outrun. TEGO hustled to command into the first turn,
moved clear into the backstretch and set the pace along the rail, was joined heading to the half, lost the lead soon after, was in a bit tight leaving the far turn
and faltered. Following a stewards' inquiry into the stretch run and an objection by the rider of WIRED IN, SECRET SANCTUARY was disqualified from
second and placed third. An objection by the rider of WIRED IN against the winner was not allowed.

Footnotes
R TENDERONI pulled her way clear early and set a rated pace towards the rail, handled outside pressure from BIG CHEEKS leaving the three quarter pole,
shook clear of that one while still in hand into the far turn, responded when put to firm asking soon into the stretch, turned away an outside challenge from
ABIDALE in mid stretch, kicked back away under a drive then was steadily hand ridden the final yards. ABIDALE rated forwardly and was angled out near
the five eighths, moved up three wide leaving the far turn, took closer order under a hustling ride to have aim into the stretch, gave hard pursuit of the winner
from there, kept on willingly but was no match in the final sixteenth. HOW LUCKY , off the pace and three to four wide, moved up outside rivals leaving the
three eighths, chased into the lane but lacked a solid finish. DULCE KIARA stumbled at the break and took a few strides to recover, was a bit keen and
steadied off foes early, edged up between runners leaving the far turn, chased to the inside of a rival into the stretch then faded late. MY BOSS LADY , well
placed inside, came under pressure near the three eighths, failed to kick on and gave way. BIG CHEEKS , five wide nearing the seven eighths, rushed up
outside the winner past the three quarter pole, forced the pace to the half mile marker, faltered leaving the far turn and was eased late.

his business in the drive. FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY , three deep the first turn, chased the winner throughout, weakened and held the place. CLUBMAN lightly
bumped with the winner at the start, circled the far turn three wide and failed to rally in an even effort. OXIDE lacked speed, swung to the four path leaving

Footnotes
EXCELLORATOR , bumped from both sides at the break, was taken back and settled well off a four ply early pace scrum, saved ground when picking up
some momentum leaving the far turn, angled out and quickly gained four wide into the stretch, surged and put a head in front of SHAFT'S BULLET in mid
stretch, dueled head to head from there and just got the bob following an extended drive. SHAFT'S BULLET rated in the clear and off the contested pace,
responded when given his cue and moved up three to four wide near the quarter pole, forged clear soon into the lane, dug in when confronted by the winner
in mid stretch, fought valiantly to the inside of that one and just missed. WORKIN ON A DREAM settled off the embattled leaders, gained three to four wide
nearing the quarter pole, was no match for the top pair in the final three sixteenths but churned on to gain the show. GULFSTREAM WAY got into a duel two
wide and between runners around the first turn, carried that fight through the backstretch while coaxed along, briefly shook clear while drafting down
towards the rail mid way on the final turn, could not contain the charge of SHAFT'S BULLETT in upper stretch, kept on with effort to mid stretch then
weakened. GUILLAUME , bumped at the break, saved ground, swung out nearing mid stretch but lacked a serious run. SEICHE settled off the pace, lost
ground four to five wide while outside rivals into the far turn then lacked a stretch bid. BENANDJOE , bumped at the break, disputed the pace inside a trio of
rivals, backed off the leaders leaving the far turn, gave hard chase to the head of the lane then faded. BRILLIANT CHASE , five wide to contention, bid four
deep into the backstretch, vied outside rivals past the five eighths, stayed on to force the issue outside GULFSTREAM WAY past the five sixteenths then
weakened near mid stretch. MOSE PERFECT , forward three wide around the first turn, drafted back off the leaders leaving the three quarter pole, dropped
further back around the final turn, angled five wide and faded. JALEN JOURNEY , a bit rank advancing four then three wide between foes early, contested
the pace between rivals through the backstretch and into the far turn, chased past the five sixteenths then faltered.

JOHN THE BEAR rushed up outside horses down the backstretch, prompted the pace outside DREAMS UNTOLD on the turn, secured command in upper
stretch, drew off under urging and drifted out late. GOING TO THE LEAD , well placed between horses on the turn, was fanned five wide at the head of the
stretch and rallied. WAR TOCSIN , shuffled back along the rail entering the turn, swung to the four path leaving the turn and flattened out beteween rivals.
GAGETOWN bumped with NOBLE GASTON leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail on the turn, remained inside foes in the lane and was not a
factor. WHISKEY AND YOU , wide on the turn, was fanned six deep entering the stretch. DREAMS UNTOLD accelerated to the early lead, set the pace
near the inner rail and gave way the final furlong. NOBLE GASTON , bumped and in tight quarters at the start, was steadied along behind horses down the
backstretch and failed to be a factor.

Footnotes
RESPONSE TIME rated kindly while tracking PRINCESS KOKACHIN, moved up outside and engaged that one mid turn, forced the issue into the stretch,
saw PRINCESS KOKACHIN get away a bit past the three sixteenths, found more under left handed asks past mid stretch, kept on relentlessly while drifting
and forged ahead in the final yards. PRINCESS KOKACHIN bumped at the break, quickly cleared and set the pace under some rating and towards the rail,
dug in when joined by the winner mid turn, responded and kicked back clear in upper stretch, continued gamely but just failed to contain the winner's
charge. MOODY WOMAN settled back off the pace and off the inside, circled five wide under a hustling ride and rallied. FRAUDULENT CHARGE bobbled
at the break, edged up early and chased three wide, came four wide under pressure into the lane but lacked a punch through the final furlong. STREET
LUTE broke outward and bumped with her stablemate, corrected and edged up heading to the half, secured the rail and gave hard chase past the five
sixteenths, continued inside and under a ride into the lane, lacked a kick past the three sixteenths and faded under a hand ride. PAISLEY SINGING saved
ground off the pace, angled out in the drive and failed to menace.
