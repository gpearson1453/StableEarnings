Footnotes
BILLYKUS broke alertly and quickly sprinted clear, raced along the inner rail and prevailed under some urging. BUBBA CHROME , a forward factor early,
was in the two path around the turn and futilely chased the winner. ANNIESALLINCLUSIVE , three deep around the turn, failed to rally. RASCALLY REBEL
, under urging soon after the break, hugged the inner rail around the turn and was always outrun. POINT US HOME , outrun, hugged the inner rail around
the turn. UNIFIED PLAY dropped back on the turn.

Footnotes
DOTADA , nudged on soon after the break, sped up and took command leaving the chute, set a rated pace towards the rail, spurted away after being
roused entering the lane, widened under a drive in mid stretch then was steadily hand ridden the final sixteenth. GWYNEDD , three deep prompting the
pace, was under pressure into the lane, gave game chase from there and cut back into the margin a bit through the final seventy yards. HEART LIGHT
bumped with a rival at the start, saved ground, was put to asking around the turn, chased into the lane and kept on with some effort while holding onto the
show. MUSICAL CAT , bumped at the break, raced off the pace and three wide between foes into the turn, shifted out some for the drive and churned on.
CLASSIC LYNNE was steadied back to last when in tight at the start, regrouped and was sent up between runners heading to the three quarter pole,
tracked the winner from her outside, failed to kick on under pressure into the stretch and tired. HOLDING COURT , four wide between runners into the turn,
dropped back. POET IN MY HEART , away alertly and flashed some speed, drafted back five wide outside rivals leaving the three quarter pole, failed to kick
on into the far turn and faltered.

TAM CHAR broke a step slow, regrouped and was sent up outside rivals in the opening furlong to take a short lead, handled inside pressure from
FORTUNATA ITALIA, spurted away when given her cue approaching the quarter pole, kept on under solid handling past mid stretch and held firm to the
wire. FORTUNATA ITALIA prompted the pace to the inside of the winner, steadied when in a bit close mid turn, shifted out in the drive and finished gamely.
SWEET TALIA , off the pace and under asking around the turn, angled five wide into the lane and got by faders for the show. FANCY PRINCESS stalked
the pace, raced four wide mid turn, failed to kick on nearing mid stretch and faded. BELLA BETTINA , three wide with pursuit, weakened in the drive. An
objection by the rider of FORTUNATA ITALIA against the winner for alleged interference around the turn was not allowed. PER RULING #23-031 FROM
THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, TAM CHAR WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

inside horses on the turn, moved to the inner rail approaching the stretch, remained along the rail in the lane and flattened out. PEACHESSWEETNOTION ,
well placed in the three path on the turn, lacked a rally. LIL SPINNER , no factor, turned for home in the three path. BROOKLYN GIRL , outrun, was five
deep entering the stretch and weakened on her left lead. GINGER BERRIES , outrun, raced in the four path leaving the turn. MAMA'S EYES rushed up

Footnotes
TOM TERRIFIC drafted well back in the opening furlong as a duel developed up front, came under pressure around the turn, edged up three wide into the
lane, worked outward past mid stretch, leveled off under a drive and forged ahead in the final yards. BREITHORN , into the race at once, dueled inside a trio
of rivals past the five sixteenths, shook clear under a drive in mid stretch, wandered outward a bit in deep stretch, kept on gamely but just could not fend off
the winner's charge. JIMMY THE KID disputed the pace two wide between rivals, emerged as the closest pursuer past the eighth pole, stayed on well but
settled for the show. BAHAMA CHANNEL dropped back off the pace while saving ground into the turn, swung six wide for the drive and was going well at
the wire. ALL FOR LOVE , bumped at the break, saved ground off the duelers, edged up while saving ground in mid stretch then flattened out. NOMO RON
, three deep attending the pace, battled between foes on near even terms past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on leaving mid stretch and weakened.
CHROME FINISH lunged outward at the break and bumped with ALL FOR LOVE, corrected and hustled up to be in range four wide, came five wide under a
ride into the lane and faded. BROOKS ROBINSON , four wide in range of the duelers into the turn, bid four deep mid turn, forced the issue to the head of
the lane then succumbed.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF CLASS , steadied waiting for room behind horses leaving the turn, was taken to the inner rail at the head of the lane, moved up to challenge for
the lead in mid stretch, drifted out in the drive with her rider's whip in close proximity to the head of LADRO DI FICHI and narrowly prevailed. LADRO DI
FICHI chased the pace racing in the three path around the turn, was floated four wide in upper stretch, gained the lead approaching the eighth pole, was
floated out in the drive and just missed. BACKSTREET AFFAIR showed speed along the inner rail, drifted out turning for home and weakened.
RATIONALMILLENNIAL , two wide on the turn, angled six wide in upper stretch and failed to menace. EARLEY ROSE , along the inner rail in the turn, failed
to rally. FASHIONATTA rushed up after breaking slowly, prompted the pace to the stretch and tired. FLAT OUT COOL , four deep on the turn, weakened.
An objection by the rider of LADRO DI FICHI against the winner for alleged interference in the stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
MIT MAZEL took over early then met an inside bid from BLUEBERRY INDIGO nearing the three quarter pole, went in tandem with that one for a furlong
then was nudged on to separate into the turn, rated kindly while saving some ground past the three eighths, eased out some and responded when set down
soon into the stretch, opened up under a solid drive in mid stretch then maintained a comfortable advantage while cruising through the final sixty yards. SHE
IS WISKY settled four wide off the early pace, took closer order three wide nearing the lane, failed to kick on with the winner but kept on willingly to be well
clear of the rest. DRY WELL saved ground early on, angled out leaving the far turn, circled four wide under a ride into the lane but lacked a serious finish.
BLUEBERRY INDYGO , bumped at the break, moved up to the inside of the winner nearing the six furlong maker and contested the pace, rated back a bit
nearing the turn, angled out and made another run mid turn, lacked a punch in upper stretch and faded through the final eighth. FLIMSY , bumped at the
start, stalked the early pace, saved ground into the far turn, shifted out five wide for the drive and gave way. PROPER STORM lagged back, saved ground
mid turn and was outrun.
