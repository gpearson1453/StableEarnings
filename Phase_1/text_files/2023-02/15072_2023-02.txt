Footnotes
HIGHLY WICKED set the pace two wide into the first turn, cleared and crossed over approaching the backstretch, drew away from a pair of outer chasers
with nine sixteenths to go, opened up around the far turn, widened under driving pressure through upper stretch, and was put to wraps at the sixteenth pole.
PICKIN ANA GRINNIN broke on top, yet inwardly causing her to shy and nimbly avoid the inner rail, raced off of the pace along the inside, pulled in the two
path to be rank behind foes around the first turn, shifted out down the backstretch, claimed place from a pair of inner foes at the three furlong pole, and
pulled clear of the rest while no match for the winner. REINA ACES popped open the gate without leaving it pre-race, pursued from midpack along the
inside, chased in the four path around the far turn, tucked to the two path while tiring entering the lane, yet improved between horses in midstretch for a
minor share. BLESS D'SOUTH broke a step slow, trailed in the four path around the first turn, fanned to the six path in upper stretch, and moved up.
MIDNIGHT FLAME broke a beat slow, pressed three wide leaving the first turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader at the nine sixteenths pole, and tired
around the far turn. TAZZHER bumped with an inner rival at the start, and was outrun in the four to three paths. ZIPPING MOLLY prompted the pace inside
of a rival into the first turn, switched course outside of that foe around that bend as another out rival moved to apply pressure, but failed to keep pace with
the leader with nine sixteenths to go, and faded around the far turn. SANGIOVESE bumped with an outer rival at the start, chased two wide, but was done
entering the far turn.

Footnotes
NOTION rated just off the pace early, started to move at the three eighths pole, was in full control of the race through the turn, was kept to task in the furlong
ground and won easily. BUTLER CABIN was urged out of the gates, was allowed to settle in the beginning of the race, was asked at the quarter pole from
the three path, where he excelled and finished gamely but just missed. ROCKALL was a bit reluctant to load and then was off a step slow, moved up off the
leaders in the second tier from the inside, saved ground through the turn was within striking distance down the lane but struggled to switch leads until late
and faded. CREATIVE STRATEGY took the early lead, after the half followed the leader closely from the inside, stopped down the lane. BRILLIANT
COLORS save ground early and never fired. TIZZY TANTRUM never involved.

Footnotes
BANKROLL bobbled a bit while taking a bump from an outer rival at the start, stalked outside of the top pair, ranged up while looming a danger turning for
home, bid entering the lane, cleared in upper stretch under hand urging in upper stretch, held sway under right handed shoulder taps in the final furlong, and
lasted safely. WAR TROLLEY broke a step slow before shying to the rear at the start, trailed in the four path around the turn, swung seven wide in upper
stretch, rallied in hopes of reeling in the clear leader late, but did not have enough. GTUONE BUCK broke a step slowly, tracked along the inside, shifted
outside of the top trio in upper stretch, and chased between horses to gain show. REVERENT broke many paths outwardly causing trouble for outer rivals at
the start, set the pace inside of a vying rival while under steady coaxing, but proved no match for an outer bidder leaving the quarter pole, and weakened.
LIFEASWEKNOWIT was bumped and forced out multiple paths by an inner rival at the start, vied for the lead two wide, but yielded between horses entering
the lane. MAGIC LIGHTNING leaned in and bumped a rival at the start, lacked speed four wide, but yielded while being floated to the six path and between
horses in upper stretch, and gave way on his left lead. LETSTAKEITOUTSIDE shied from an outer rival at the eleven sixteenths pole, chased two wide and
between horses into the turn, but weakened.

Footnotes
BOSSHOG THEM DUKES stalked the top pair from the two path, then outside of them around the far turn, bid in upper stretch, sparked a duel with LEROY
JENKINS in the process, dueled through the final furlong while hanging on his left lead, and prevailed. LEROY JENKINS vied two wide, led entering the
lane, resisted an outer rival's bid coming to midstretch, dueled through the final furlong, but was bested. RONITHELIMODRIVER laid off of the pace in the
four to three paths, and moved up between horses approaching the furlong grounds. EXCLAIM broke slowly, lagged behind, moved out of last two wide
around the far turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch, and stayed on. COSTELLO'S KITTEN tracked three wide, ranged up four wide turning for home,
but weakened in upper stretch. TOP NOTE vied along the inside, but weakened entering the lane. MOSH PIT lacked speed along the inside, and gave way
into the far turn.

Footnotes
SPECIAL OPERATOR was off a step slow was able to find his stride in the five path down the backside, gained ground in the turn as he circled the field
from the outside, continued to gain momentum in the stretch, caught the early leader near the furlong ground, those two matched strides late, battled
grudgingly, and prevailed. MONGOLIAN BEE was fast out of the gates, set the early pace, was caught by the eventual winner late in the stretch, battled for
the win but didn't have enough toady. GALLANT BUCK settled behind the early leaders in the second tier, waited for room into the turn, was brought out five
wide into and down the stretch had a late kick but it wasn't enough to catch the winner. BACK BEAT was pushed out early by another rival, settled down the
back side four wide, stayed wide through out the rest of the race, was driven down the stretch and made up ground with a late game effort but had to settled
for fourth. BELLO CREEDO vied for the lead, was rated just off the leaders hip, was collared by the eventual winner in the turn and tired in the stretch.
MIDNIGHT DREAMING was never involved.

Footnotes
MISHPACHAH set the pace in the two path around the first turn, drew clear down the backstretch, then held sway while drifting about in midstretch. VALE
MALE laid off of the pace while shifting from the two to three path around the first turn, pursued while tipping out to the four path around the far turn, stayed
on to bid for place entering the final sixteenth, and gained that position in the shadow of the wire. BOX OF PICTURES broke out at the start, tracked in the
three to two path while tucking around the first turn, chased the clear leader around the far turn, lacked a bid while holding place into the final furlong, but
met an outer rival's challenge for that position a sixteenth from home, and got caught. MEDLEY took a light brush from an inner rival at the start, stalked in
the four to three paths while outside of rivals around the first turn, chased around the far turn, but yielded between horses entering the lane.
VISIONOFWILDTIMES tracked along the inside, but lacked a bid. GATOR PROUD laid far back along the inside, tugged behind traffic in the two path
entering the backstretch, shifted out to the five path soon after, but faded around the far turn, and was eased through the final furlong. AVERI EVER AFTER
raced at the rear in the three to five paths around the first turn, and was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
SOUTHLAWN stalked along the inside, moved through a rail opening to challenge the leader leaving the five furlong pole, led at the nine sixteenths pole,
drew clear entering the far turn, then inched further away under a drive through the final furlong. BRU NA BOINNE tracked four wide around both turns, then
stayed on while hanging on his left lead to bid for place in midstretch, gained that position in the final furlong, and held it from an inner bidder late. FOREST
CHIMES broke a beat slow, saved ground towards the rear around the turns, awaited racing room nearing the lane, then sustained a rail rally to bid for
place in the final furlong, but was denied reaching that position. HAYUNEVANO stalked three wide, gained place at the three furlong pole, wandered about
while holding that position to the furlong grounds, but yielded between horses in the late stages. HUNTLEIGH laid off of the pace along the inside while
under snug restraint around the first turn, saved ground around the far turn, altered course three wide and between horses in upper stretch, lacked a kick
through narrow quarters in midstretch, and failed to split rivals thereafter. GHOSTLY GIRL lacked speed two to three wide and between horses, and failed to
menace. SWEET ALYSSA laid off of the pace three to five wide, and failed to factor between horses. SAVAGE DARLING broke slowly, raced at the rear
four wide, fanned six wide in upper stretch, and made little impact. CHARRIERE prompted the pace inside of the leader, attempted to switch outside of that
foe coming to the five furlong pole, but allowed for the eventual winner to move through in the process, tucked and chased that foe from the rail around the
far turn, then weakened between horses in upper stretch. OATH OF ALLEGIANCE set the pace two wide, tossed his head from restraint entering the
backstretch, got headed by a rail bidder approaching the nine sixteenths pole, and wilted between horses around the far turn.
