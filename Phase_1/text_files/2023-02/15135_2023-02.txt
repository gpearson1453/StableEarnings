speed then made a four to five wide late rally in the stretch. SWAMP ROCK had good early speed away from the gate then vied for the lead to the top of the
stretch and gave way. DON'T BLINK TWICE raced near the back to the turn then showed late interest to improve her position. GOTTEMINABIND bobbled
at the start then settled in the middle of the pack to the turn then moved out to three or four wide but failed to menace. MUCHO MACHO BABY tracked the
leaders from the three path to the top of the stretch but lacked a late response. CIRCLEOFSOUL saved ground to no avail. MISS GRAND SLAM showed

HOT CAROL vied for the lead to the top of the stretch then took over and drew clear. THINKITASADONATION tracked the leaders from the two path then
made a late surge in the final sixteenth but was not enough. MYSTERIOUS STAR had good speed while being challenged and gave way grudgingly. BITSY
C C LIL GIRL raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the turn and flattened out. ALYS EPISODE was off the
pace on the inside while racing evenly. CUSTOM GUITAR raced in the middle of the pack but failed to menace. COLD AS YOU was not a threat. ANGEL
ARKIE broke out slightly, went three or four wide on the turn but was never a factor. FORT PIKE was outrun.

FRIENDOFTHECOURT pressed the pace to the first turn then took a clear lead on the backstretch and won going away. TAPPED OUT had good speed to
take the early challenged lead to the first turn then vied for the lead to the final turn and weakened but made a rebid to save the place. WEDINGTON was
forwardly placed around the first turn then made a three wide middle move but was out finished in late stretch. DALLAS GOLD was taken up to avoid the
loose rival at the start then was allowed to settle around the first turn and made a rebid three wide at the quarter pole and just missed the show. BODE'S
LIGHT raced near the back down the backstretch then made a three wide bid at the five sixteenths pole to improve position. SECULAR STAGNATION was
allowed to settle to the final turn then made a three wide bid a the three sixteenths pole but failed to menace. WAYPOINT was off the pace on the inside but
was not a threat. LIAM SKYE was always back. DEALMEINBUD was off the pace down the backstretch and retreated. BIG ROJO stumbled badly at the
start, lost his rider and walked off. STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE, AFTER A REVIEW STEWARDS DECLARED THAT BIG
ROJO WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS OWN PROBLEMS SO THERE WAS NO CHANGES. FINAL TIME WAS ADJUSTED FROM 134.59 TO 135.52.

ST MARIA went to a challenged lead to the three eighths then inched away, drew clear on the turn and was ridden out. MISS MIRACLE GIRL pressed the
pace from the two path to the three eighths pole and was no match for the winner but was a clear second. SARATOGA KAREN stalked the pace from the
inside and passed tiring rival. OVERLY SWEET was unhurried down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the final turn, moving out to five wide in
upper stretch and made a late rally. VANCOUVER SNOW was allowed to settle around the first turn then made a three wide bid at the three eighths and
flattened out. TALE OF TENSAS was forwardly placed in the three path to the top of the stretch and gave way. I LOVE YOU MORE tracked the leaders
around the first turn and retreated. GALAXY AFFAIR chased the leaders around the first turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
MOR BIG LEE was unsettled in the gate, tracked the leaders around the first turn then moved up on the backstretch, making his bid at the three eighths
pole from four wide then took the lead at the five sixteenths pole and just lasted. I SEE CLEARLY NOW pressed the pace from the inside to the final turn
then dropped back, made a rebid up the rail into the stretch and just missed. RANCH WATER was allowed to settle down the backstretch then made a three
or four wide at the five sixteenths pole for a late rally and missed the place. KAJUN KARMA was restless in the gate, unhurried down the backstretch then
moved up on the final turn, going four to five wide in upper stretch for a late run but only passed tiring rivals. GOLDENLUTE had good early speed around
the first turn then vied for the lead down the backstretch, dueled around the final turn and shook loose but weakened. A MILLION STARS failed to menace.
MAKE YOUR DESTINY saved ground to no avail. FLASHY BOY went five wide into the first turn the vied for the lead to the quarter pole and gave way.
CARLOS'S MAMA was never a threat. ADIEU ACES was loose in the post parade, was forwardly placed around the first turn then moved up from five wide
at the three eighths pole, when asked entering the turn he stopped, distanced, jogged in, walked off.
