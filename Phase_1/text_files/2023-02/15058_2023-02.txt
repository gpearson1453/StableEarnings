TIMELY SECRET no speed to the turn with an outside rush to the front, sustained the bid and cleared late in good fashion. STELLAR LEGACY perfect spot
throughout, proving no match for winner while holding the place spot. HEAVENLY HASH had no speed early on, steadied out of turn, rallied along in the
stretch with a rough trip in the drive, coming on when clear for show spot and just missed place spot. CARMEL SUNRISE unhurried to the turn with a widest
run into the stretch to improve in the late going. ICY STARE speed to the front, stayed to deep stretch but faltered in the late going.
SEVENTEENSEVITYSIX raced back from inside to the stretch with a mild bid in the drive but faltered late. PROUD PERFORMER chased leader to the
stretch, could not keep up and faded through the late going. MS. THE LAW well placed while never far back to the turn and gave way readily through the
stretch.

Footnotes
LADY LOWERY outside chase turn, took over three wide, went clear ridden out. FAST N HAPPY had an awkward start with no speed to the turn, rallied in
earnest with good position outside into the stretch with clear run and proved best of the rest while no match for the winnner. GRANNY LAW speed between
horses to the turn, still game stretch, weakened. AUDREY'S WILLOW outside run to quarter pole, raced on evenly in the stretch run. MIDNIGHT MEGHAN
unhurried to turn, widest run in the stretch run to improve late. ACCIDENTAL ICON not sharp from the gate, unhurried to turn, improved position. SEA YA
broke well from the gate, rider lost left iron shortly after the start, recovered quickly while never a menace. WORST BEHAVIOUR just off leades to the turn,
faded back in the stretch run. GUN RUNNIN' GAL never factored throughout. SWEET ARIA through early, stopped. FRACING ALLSTAR bit tardy from
gate, never factored throughout. BRYLEE rushed inside to the turn, gave way readily thereafter.
