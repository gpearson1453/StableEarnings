Footnotes
ROYAL PAIN rated close in the three path the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and improved through the far turn, dug in at the rail leaving the
turn, got up mid-stretch and held off ONE NIGHT MIKE through the final sixteenth. The latter bobbled and made contact with Thunderinreadyrick leaving the
gate then stalked toward the inside, picked up the chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead two deep nearing the quarter, raced clear
midway on the far turn but was met mid-stretch and relented the final sixteenth. SPANGLISH settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase toward
the three eighths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, though, flattened inside the eighth pole. NOBALLSTWOSTRIKES raced in the four path the
first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn in the three and four paths, left the turn outside and showed little more.
PENGUIN PARADE saved ground off the pace, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. THUNDERINREADYRICK
was bumped then steadied leaving the gate but took the lead approaching the three quarter pole and rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the
five sixteenths, was met at the quarter and faded at the rail on the far turn.

CRUZ IN THE CASTLE took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, held the advantage at the
rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly to hold off JACK'S LILLY, who stalked from the three path on the first turn and bid leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, contested the far turn off the rail, dug in from the head of the lane but missed the nod in a game finish. SWEET ANNABELLA stalked from the four
path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and came along to take third under the wire.
DON'T TELL GRANDMA rated close inside, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, flattened stride later yards and was
nipped from third under the wire. GOSSIPING rounded the opening turn off the rail, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but flattened at the rail on the
far turn. MY EXPENSIVE GIFT saved ground on the first turn, eased out leaving the turn and showed little response.

SISTER'S DUTY was forced slightly out and into Lectric Rod after the start then gave chase through the backstretch, closed to the front two deep midway
on the turn and held on well with steady stretch handling. MO CO GOLD ducked out and exchanged contact with LADY SERENITY and was forced further
upon that on a stride or two later, gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn and dueled through the stretch for second. The latter
exchanged contact with Mo Co Gold leaving the gate then forced out and into Sister's Duty a stride or two later, gave chase through the backstretch,
rounded the turn about the six path and finished well to take third the final strides. LADY QUINN bore out and into Mo Co Gold leaving the gate then gave
chase through the backstretch, raced two deep on the turn, drifted toward the head of the lane and was nipped from third the final strides. CASTLE TOY
drew clear at the half mile pole and angled to the inside to set the pace, was met at the rail midway on the turn then weakened inside the sixteenth pole.
MANAGED MISCHIEF chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn at the rail and weakened in the lane. LECTRIC ROD was brushed after the start,
chased outside and rounded the turn in the five path.

Footnotes
WARRIORINTHEHOUSE was hustled along with the early pace while tapering in, dueled clear at the quarter pole and was kept alert through the stretch.
JUJU ON DA BEAT chased through the backstretch, raced in the four path of the turn and cleared second later yards. BANK CARD chased through the
backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail and relented second in later yards. PRETTY CASTLE steadied from early contention then picked up the chase
leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the turn in the three path and passed rivals in the lane. LAURA'S GRAND chased through the backstretch, raced
near the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane. OK EMILY was unprepared for the start, gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the
turn and showed little in the stretch. SWISS HORIZON was pinched back at the rail nearing the seven sixteenths pole then gave chase through the
backstretch and raced at the rail on the turn. GATTOLOTTASPARKLE gave chase and rounded the turn in the six path. BOWMANS LAZY GIRL was forced
in nearing the seven sixteenths pole then pressured the pace, but dropped back at the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the turn and weakened in the lane.
The Stewards reviewed, then dismissed claims of foul against the riders of Warriorinthehouse, for alleged interference nearing the seven sixteenths pole,
and against the rider of Pretty Castle for alleged interference into the turn, lodged by the rider of Swiss Horizon.

Footnotes
TOE TAPPIN LUKE drifted into the first turn and stalked through the turn, took the edge toward the three eighths pole and dueled at mostly even terms from
that point, edged clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled to hold on. ROYAL THUNDER raced two deep on the first turn and gave chase into
the backstretch, steadily closed toward contention, rounded the turn in the three path and dug in under steady encouragement to finish well at the outside
poll of the winner. CLOSE THE CASE settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn off the
rail, angled to the outside leaving the turn and finished evenly to take third mid-stretch. MISSIONSNINETYNINE was carried out into the first turn then
stalked about the four path through the turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened in the lane. CHARLIE
POTATOES saved ground on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, closed to the heels of BUTTONED UP at the rail approaching the
eighth pole, came around that one leaving the turn but showed little more. BUTTONED UP set the early pace inside, was met and gave chase nearing the
three eighths pole but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and weakened in the lane. REMEMBERING WILBUR saved ground on the first turn,
gave chase from the three eighths pole but showed no response and was eased the final quarter mile. FRIENDLY FELLA was pulled up with a fatal injury
shortly after the start and was euthanized on the track.

Footnotes
GOT FLOFFY accelerated to the lead toward the seven sixteenths pole and rated the early pace, was pressured leaving the three eighths, contested the
edge at the rail on the turn and held on well under steady stretch encouragement. FIT BUT FAT was bumped outward and into Adios See Ya leaving the
gate then pressured the pace from the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. BAYTOWN JAKESTER came out
and exchanged contact with Forever The Boss leaving the gate and was kept in check off the heels of Dinner Bell through the backstretch, raced near the
rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. POLITICAL DECISION bore in and made contact with Billingsgate on the chute then gave chase, raced two deep
on the turn, was carried out into the lane but finished evenly. BILLINGSGATE was bumped then came in and made contact with Baytown Jakester on the
chute and settled off the early pace, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced in the seven path of the turn and ran widest through the lane.
DINNER BELL came out at the start and made contact with Baytown Jakester on the chute, gave chase inside, raced off the rail on the turn, eased out
leaving the turn then flattened the final sixteenth. ABOUT TO RAGE ducked out and hit the gate at the start, made light contact with Fit But Fat then
pressured the pace, but dropped back nearing the quarter pole and faded while losing ground on the turn. FOREVER THE BOSS was forced in and into
Baytown Jakester then picked back on the chute. VIDMER'S COURAGE was pinched back at the start and never factored. ADIOS SEE YA was bumped
leaving the gate then chased outside, weakened leaving the five sixteenths pole and raced in the six path of the turn. ORIGINALLY HAND-TIMED, TIMES
CHANGED UPON REVIEW.
