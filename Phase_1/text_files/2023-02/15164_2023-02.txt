Footnotes
CAIRO WARRIOR was in a steady drive to stalk the pace from the three path down the backstretch, then rallied on the far turn to close fastest down the
stretch and was just up to prove best. SEDUCTIVE U S A was allowed to settle while two wide, was saving ground on the backstretch to rally four wide on
the far turn then surged down the stretch, just missing the win in the end. ENTERTAINMENT lead the way heading into the first turn, was in a steady drive
down the backstretch into the second turn, then continued to menace gamely down the stretch but was caught in the end. DON'TASK DON'TTELL tracked
the pace from the two path in the middle of the field, then rallied while three wide on the second turn to close well down the stretch lane but it was not
enough. KOKOKOMO raced along the inside on the backstretch, was moving up to bid on the far turn but came up evenly in the stetch. JOHAN ZOFFANI
(IRE) tracked the pace while three wide on the backstretch, then came out five wide on the far turn to make a mild bid in the stretch but it was too little too
late. PEACOCK KITTEN stalked the pace from the two path, was in a long drive entering the stretch lane, was used up and gave way in the end. CHARLIE
G settled along the inside at one speed and never fired.
