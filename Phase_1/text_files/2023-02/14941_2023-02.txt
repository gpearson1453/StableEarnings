Footnotes
OBVIOUS showed speed and was close to the early pace, pressed INTO BOURBON to the quarter marker, lost ground to that rival in upper stretch,
re-rallied nearing the furlong marker, overtook his stablemate nearing the sixteenth-marker and dug in gamely in the final strides to hold the runner-up at
bay. TRABIESO AVELITO took back off of the solid early pace, saved ground to the quarter marker, angled four to five wide for the drive, closed well under
firm urging inside of the furlong marker, could not get by the determined winner in deep stretch and held for second in the final strides. EL CHARRO
CHAMP tracked the pace from the inside, gained ground on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, encountered traffic while between runners inside of the
furlong marker and was outfinished in deep stretch, while holding safely in the end for third. FRISCO KID chased the solid early pace, raced three wide into
the stretch and offered a mild late rally. TWIRLING DERBY crowded at the start by OBVIOUS and was off a step slowly, lacked speed through the turn,
raced two wide into the stretch and improved position late, while unable to threaten. INTO BOURBON hustled to establish the early lead, set solid fractions
while pressed to the quarter marker by OBVIOUS, shook free in upper stretch, was overtaken nearing the sixteenth-marker and weakened in deep stretch.

Footnotes
BOURBON GLAZE forwardly placed into the first turn, advanced to prompt the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, pressed outside of the
pacesetter to the quarter marker, assumed command in upper stretch, was set down for the drive and drew away in the final furlong. JAZZY LOVE stumbled
at the start then was allowed to settle in the early stages, raced outside of rivals along the backstretch run, came three wide into the stretch run, rallied
nearing the furlong marker, could not match strides with BOURBON GLAZE in deep stretch and stayed on to secure the place. DANZIGS STAR STORM
assumed command after a good beginning and dictated terms early on, set modest fractions while pressured to the half-mile marker, held BOURBON
GLAZE at bay to the quarter marker, could not hold that one off in upper stretch, gave way in the final furlong and just held for third in the final strides. BIG
GIFT stumbled at the start and was off a step slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, well placed through the backstretch run, saved ground to the top of
the lane, did not offer a late rally and just missed for show in the final strides. PRANCIN N THE PARK was a bit keen along the first turn, remained on a
snug hold to the half-mile marker while not far back, chased two to three wide into the stretch run and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
JAM SESSION broke sharply and showed good early speed to assume command, set solid fractions to the quarter marker, was confronted by DOUBLE
JAB in upper stretch, battled inside of that rival to the sixteenth-marker, repelled the runner-up in the final stages and kept to task in the end to prevail.
DOUBLE JAB tracked the solid early pace, advanced on the pacesetter while two wide on the turn, continued to close on JAM SESSION leaving the turn,
gamely battled with the winner to deep stretch and was turned away in the final stages, while besting the rest. EL BROMISTA was bothered at the start by
CRAWLINGBACKTOYOU and was away slowly, recovered to chase the solid pace heading to the turn, raced four wide into the turn, slipped to the inside
nearing the quarter marker, came in tight approaching the top of the lane, could not make headway on the top pair in deep stretch and finished well clear of
the rest for third. CUT ACROSS SHORTY chased the solid early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch and gave way
in the final furlong. CRAWLINGBACKTOYOU broke in at the start and crowded EL BROMISTA, trailed to the quarter marker and was not a factor. ACERO
lacked early speed, raced five wide into the turn, lost contact into the stretch run and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
AUSTRIAN NAVY stalked the solid early pace, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker, took command in early stretch, responded to her rider's
urging inside of the furlong marker and determinedly dug in in deep stretch to prevail. TIZ A TIGER rated off of the solid early pace, loomed four wide on the
turn, chased AUSTRIAN NAVY to the furlong grounds, closed into the margin inside of the furlong marker but could not get by the determined winner in the
final stages and held for second. NAN ELIZABETH bobbled leaving the start and was off a step slowly, chased from the rear in the early stages, improved
position on the turn, came in tight and was blocked while between horses nearing the top of the lane, found room in upper stretch, was gaining in the drive,
could not get by the top pair in deep stretch and was clear in the end for third. SMILIN EVIE tracked the fast early pace, was well positioned while saving
ground approaching the top of the stretch, ran evenly to mid-stretch while still in aim and lacked a late kick. JAYCEE hustled leaving the start, disputed the
fast early pace to the turn, maintained a narrow lead to the quarter marker while between runners, was overtaken by AUSTRIAN NAVY in upper stretch and
gave way in the final stages. GARDEN IN THE SKY was slow into stride early on, lacked speed through the turn and was not a factor. DEVINE DANCING
showed speed and pressed the fast early pace to the turn, began to weaken nearing the quarter marker, took up while in tight quarters approaching the top
of the lane and tired in the stretch run.

ACCLIDER broke alertly, was forwardly placed into the first turn then took back off of the loose pacesetter, tracked RACKATAPTAP to the half-mile marker,
confronted that rival while two wide approaching the top of the lane, assumed command in upper stretch, was set down for the drive and kicked clear in the
late stages. NATIONAL GENERAUX (IRE) hopped in the air at the start and was away a step slowly, settled off of the decent early fractions, advanced
while saving ground on the far turn, chased ACCLIDER while in aim of that rival to mid-stretch, could not keep pace in the final furlong and held for second
in the final strides. KOKO'S MOM unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the second turn, angled four wide in upper stretch, closed inside of the
furlong marker and just missed for place, while well clear of the rest for show. RACKATAPTAP assumed command in the early stages and set the pace to
the first turn, drew to a clear lead along the backstretch run, raced in the two path into the far turn, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, was
overtaken in upper stretch and faded in the late stages. NICKEL NICKEL NINE rated off the decent early pace, advanced along the backstretch run, gained
four wide nearing the quarter marker, swung five wide into the stretch run and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
CONTINENTAL UNION broke in good order, tracked the fast pace while outside of rivals to the turn, chased to the quarter marker, rallied four wide into the
drive, closed determinedly in the stretch run, came to even terms with UNCLE WILBUR nearing the sixteenth-marker, took a narrow lead in deep stretch
and held on in the final strides to prevail. UNCLE WILBUR chased the fast early pace from the inside, swung three wide for the stretch drive, finished well in
the final furlong, raced on even terms with CONTINENTAL UNION in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while just holding for second. INDIANERA
was shuffled back in the early stages while in tight quarters, chased two wide to the quarter marker, rallied four wide into the drive, closed with a rush inside
of the furlong marker, could not reel in the top pair but just missed in the final strides and was up for third. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET showed early speed
and contested the fast early pace, dueled outside of MINOSO to the quarter marker, shook free of that rival in upper stretch, was all out nearing the
sixteenth-marker, could not hold off CONTINENTAL UNION in the late stages and was outfinished for the minor awards. RHODIUM RUNNER stalked the
fast early pace, raced two wide between rivals to the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened. MINOSO forwardly placed in the early
stages, disputed the fast early pace to the turn, battled with GENTLEMAN'S SECRET to the quarter marker, lost position in upper stretch and gave way in
the final stages. QUIET CHARM was unprepared at the start and was off slowly, trailed to the turn, raced outside of rivals to the quarter marker and did not
offer a late rally. BROKEN FINGER contested the early pace with a host of rivals then took back off of the fast fractions, lost ground on the turn and did not
factor in the drive.

SWANEE well placed in the early stages, tracked the fast pace from the second flight to the turn, advanced from the inside nearing the quarter marker,
tipped three then four wide in upper stretch, closed the gap on GAYLES EVENING nearing the sixteenth-marker and found more in deep stretch to kick
clear in the end. KITTY'S CANDY allowed to settle in the early going, raced two wide to the quarter marker, loomed in upper stretch, could not keep pace
with SWANEE in the final furlong and was up for place in the final strides. GAYLES EVENING disputed the fast early pace, pressed the quick fractions to
the quarter marker while outside of O'NEILL'S LEGACY, shook free in upper stretch, held foes at bay to the furlong grounds, was overtaken by SWANEE
nearing the sixteenth-marker, was outfinished in the final strides for second and held for third. MARILYN'S SMILE unhurried in the early going, raced three
wide to the quarter marker, shifted in in upper stretch, was gaining in the final furlong but could not reel in the leaders in deep stretch. TIGER QUEEN
chased the fast early pace, raced two wide between rivals on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late rally. O'NEILL'S LEGACY broke out at the
start and impeded I'LL DO IT FOR YOU, showed good early speed and set disputed fractions to the turn, set the fast pressured pace to the quarter marker,
weakened in upper stretch and faded in the final stages. DAMN THE TORPEDOES chased the fast early pace, raced outside of rivals on the turn, swung
four then five wide for the drive and tired in the final furlong. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU lost her path at the start when O'NEILL'S LEGACY broke out, lacked
speed heading to the turn, trailed to the quarter marker and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
TERRY'S BOY forwardly placed in the early stages, was well positioned while saving ground into the turn, stayed within aim to the quarter marker, swung
three wide in upper stretch, closed the gap inside of the furlong marker, took command nearing the sixteenth-marker and held in a drive over the oncoming
runner-up. CONUNDRUM shuffled at the start and was off slowly, lacked early speed, raced three wide on the turn, swung six wide for the drive, closed with
a rush inside of the furlong marker, came within aim of TERRY'S BOY in deep stretch but could not reel that one in and was up in time for place.
LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF bobbled at the start and was off slowly, was allowed to settle while saving ground on the turn, found a seam in upper stretch,
closed fast inside of the furlong marker and just missed for place, while holding safely in the end for show. DISKO TRIBUTE contested the early lead with
PLAYING HARDBALL then ceded the lead to that rival and chased to the turn, advanced between rivals on the turn and pressed the fast pace to the quarter
marker, took a narrow lead in upper stretch and battled with SHOULD BE ILLEGAL to the furlong marker, held foes at bay to the sixteenth-marker and
weakened in deep stretch. I'M DR. O was bothered at the start by a neighboring rival and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, raced two then
three wide to the quarter marker, rallied through traffic in the drive and showed good late interest, while unable to impact the leaders in deep stretch.
SHOULD BE ILLEGAL tracked the early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, vied for the lead nearing the quarter marker, battled with DISKO TRIBUTE
to mid-stretch, could not keep pace in the final sixteenth and gave way. I'M A LUCKY MAN chased the fast early pace, raced two to three wide while
between rivals on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and finished evenly in the drive. BANDERA AZTECA had an awkward start and bothered I'M DR. O
leaving the break, chased the fast early pace, raced three to four wide on the turn, swung five wide for the drive and did not mount a late rally. PLAYING
HARDBALL showed good early speed and dictated terms in the early stages, set a fast pressured pace to the quarter marker, was overtaken by DISKO
TRIBUTE in upper stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
RIO KING lagged towards the rear in the early going, saved ground through the first turn, began to move forward with a half-mile to run, found clear run
through the turn and into the stretch then rallied strongly to win clear. THATSABADBOY hustled to establish early position, took command of the pace past
the seven-eighths pole, was allowed to set a moderate, unchallenged pace through the far turn, quickened at the head of the stretch keeping all challengers
at bay until passed by the winner in the final yards. L'ENFANT DIT bumped with ZIPPY BABY at the break, settled mid-pack under some restraint the first
quarter mile, remained well behind the pace to the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and finished with a strong rally to gain third. J T'S CREDITCARD off
a beat slow from the break, was a little hard to place coming out of the turn, settled down on the rail for the backstretch run, became trapped behind horses
through the far turn, tipped out five wide into the stretch and was still unable to find a clear path until too late. YOU KIDDING ME broke well then allowed the
pace situation to play out, angled over towards the inside going into the first turn, settled in the three-path and in the clear down the backstretch, made a
wide move on the turn and got to the flank of the leader but was unable to keep up in the last furlong. NEVER SEEN BEFORE (IRE) broke well and vied for
the early lead to the clubhouse turn, settled into a tracking position behind the pacesetter, got a rail run throughout, remained a threat to the furlong grounds
then weakened. ZIPPY BABY away well and looked to get inside position on the first turn, tracked the leader to the far turn, was in the middle of a trio
making a challenge to the leader near the quarter pole then faltered in the stretch. GABBY HAYES away last from the break, was under some restraint to
the far turn, was let loose passing the seven sixteenths pole, attempted a bid while very wide through the turn, came into the stretch about seven wide and
flattened out, finishing one-paced. BLAZE OF DREAMS unhurried from the outside post at the break, floated a bit wide in the clubhouse turn, rallied some
with about three furlongs to go but was unable to improve position.
