Footnotes
TIZ BIZNESS raced in range while coaxed along in the two path, was driven around the turn and swung out to the five path entering the stretch, and rallied
to get up in the final sixteenth for the win. LAVEAU chased in the four path, was cued to range up around the turn and took command passing the quarter
pole, was cued right handed and opened slightly while shifting inside in upper stretch, but was caught by an outside foe nearing the final sixteenth to place.
WILDCAT STAR broke well to set the pace in the two path, lost the lead while along the rail early around the turn, and was one paced thru the stretch for
show. THEODOROPOULOS tracked between foes in the three path into the turn, lost ground around the turn and floated out to the six path into the lane,
and was no factor. SPONGER prompted the pace in the three path, took the lead in the two path early around the turn, but gaveway turning into the stretch.
LADY LOOKOUT brushed with an outer foe leaving the gate, was wellback in the two path and never a menace. SOPHISTICATED BOSS was reluctant to
load, then brushed an inner foe leaving the gate, and trailed throughout around the two to five paths.

Footnotes
HELLO JACK was prompted along while inside of rivals, had to steady and dropped back to last passing the three-eighths pole, was coaxed from the rail
into the lane, angled out to the five path just past the eighth pole, and rallied to draw past an inner foe late to win. STUBBORN STREAK raced in range in
the two path, was cued right handed in the four path midway around the turn and took aim entering the stretch, and kept on under left handed urging for
place. QUINCY CAFE trailed in the three path early, was roused into the turn, bid passing the three-eighths pole, took command and was confidently
handled in the four path entering the lane, began to shorten stride and was urged right handed going into the final sixteenth, and was caught by a pair of
outer foes late to show. SMOOTH RICO set the pace along the inside but gaveway approaching the quarter pole. DUE TO A PHOTO FINISH
MALFUNCTION THE FINAL MARGINS WERE ESTIMATED BY THE CHARTCALLER.

Footnotes
EMPRESS AT WAR set the pace in the two path, dug in when WAR PRINCESS reached even terms near the sixteenth pole, battled inside of that foe to the
wire and won the head bob. WAR PRINCESS pressed the winner from the three path, reached even terms near the sixteenth pole, dueled to the wire and
lost the head bob. WARDEYA settled off the early pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, loomed outside of the top two in
upper stretch but could not get past. CHIROMANTE (IRE) chased the pace inside and lacked the needed rally. KINCHEN (IRE) failed to menace while
racing three and four wide. ARISAEMA was outrun inside. SWEET CURALINA raced off the pace inside, went two wide around the far turn and never
threatened. IRISH KITTEN chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. REACHING STRIDE played no factor while racing two and three
wide. GOLDEN BELIEF raced at the rail, was through early and was easing through the lane.

Footnotes
CELESTIAL GLAZE bumped with an outer foe at the start, was slow into stride and off the pace in the four path, ranged up in the five path around the turn
and bid in the six path entering the stretch, and drew past in the final furlong while drifting out late to win. STARSHIP RENEGADE bumped with an inner foe
leaving the gate, raced prominently in the three path, was roused around the turn and tipped out to the five path into the lane, quickly shifted back to the
three path before the eighth pole, and ran on under right handed urging for place. KING CAB set the pace in the two path, was coaxed passing the quarter
pole and floated out the four path into the stretch, but yielded nearing the final sixteenth for show. GANGLY was nudged along while up close in the four
path, was in tight between foes passing the quarter pole and tipped out to the seven path into the lane, and finished evenly down the center. LUDINGTON
stalked in the two path, was ridden along the rail around the turn and was cued right handed while tipping back out to the two path into the stretch, but
flattened passing the eighth pole. BOURBON READY tracked in the two path but gaveway rounding the turn. KHAFRE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RO TOWN pressed the pace two wide, took over nearing the five-sixteenths pole and readily drew off under a drive. HOLLYWOODLAND was bumped at
the start, advanced between foes down the backstretch, angled to the rail near the three-eighths pole, tipped two wide in upper stretch and ran on for the
place. LEGENDARY tracked the pace in the clear three wide, lacked a rally and held on for the show. NIKKI M P was bumped between foes at the start,
raced four wide around the turn and passed tiring rivals. TOWN'S A BREEZE chased the pace two wide and faded through the lane. LADY IRVINE set the
pace along the rail, was collared near the five-sixteenths pole and retreated through the lane. SUDOKU TERRY failed to menace while racing four wide.
EVERY TIME was bumped at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. PALETA was outrun inside. A. P. LADY chased the pace inside, steadied
nearing the three-eighths pole, tipped two wide soon after and had no response.

Footnotes
SARATOGA FLASH stalked in the four path, bid in hand around the far turn, took an narrow lead and was roused passing the quarter pole while shifting into
the two path entering the lane, opened up into the final furlong, and held on while drifting out in the final sixteenth. LORD OF WAR raced prominently in the
three path, was coaxed into the far turn while shifting to the rail, urged right handed entering the stretch and angled out to the four path in upper stretch, ran
on for place and had to steady while getting carried out late. SIEGE OF BOSTON tracked in the two path, was roused in the three path around the far turn
and cued left handed in the five path entering the lane, and kept on for show while being floated out late. CALL CURT raced in midpack in the four path, was
under right handed urging in the six path entering the stretch, and stayed on while being carried out very late. GHOST GIANT rated in the two path, was
ridden between rivals around the far turn and in the five path entering the lane, and flattened. AFTER FIVE set the pace inside but yielded turning into the
lane. ATTENTIVE raced wellback in the three path and never threatened. ARTEMUS BRIDGE was always behind and never a threat. EXUMA (IRE) was
held up off the pace in the three path and never a menace. NO CHANGE WAS MADE AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND OBJECTION BY THE RIDER
OF THE SECOND PLACE FINISHER AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, RULING THAT IT DID NOT AFFECT
THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THE RACE.

Footnotes
THIRTY THOU KELVIN brushed with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the two path, was roused around the far turn and in the four path entering the lane,
angled inwards to the rail approaching the eighth pole, and rallied under left handed urging to get up in the final strides. BREATH AWAY (GB) steadied early
around the first turn and trailed in the three path, tipped outside of rivals and ranged up around the far turn, was in the seven path at the top of the stretch,
ran on to take the lead while drifting in just past the eighth pole under left handed urging, and was caught in final strides by a late surging inner foe to place.
CANDLE was steadied between foes midway around the first turn, chased in the five path, was driven in the six path while taking aim turning into the lane,
and kept on while being herded in slightly by an outer foe inside the final furlong, and steadied late to finish in show. CLOUDY BAY raced in midpack
between rivals in the three path, steadied slightly passing the quarter pole and was in the three path entering the stretch, got carried inwards and was forced
to alter course back out to the five path nearing the eighth pole, and finished evenly. AGUA DULCE (GB) prompted the pace in the three path, was roused
around the far turn, took a narrow lead passing the quarter pole and was in the four path entering the lane, but yielded between rivals inside the final furlong.
OUTOFNOTHINGATALL brushed with an inner foe leaving the gate and had to steady slightly just after, rated along the inside but gaveway around the far
turn. SCOTTISH SYMPHONY tracked in the four path early but never threatened. EME CLAIRE brushed with foes on both sides leaving the gate, set the
pace in the two path but yielded along the rail in upper stretch. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF THE THIRD PLACE FINISHER AGAINST THE RIDER
THE SECOND PLACE FINISHER FOR ALLEDGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH WAS DISSALLOWED.
