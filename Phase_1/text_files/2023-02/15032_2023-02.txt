Footnotes
FOR HARPER settled off of the pace along the inside, rallied in the two path around the far turn, sustained a bid inside of the leading pair leaving the furlong
marker, and drove clear. DREWSILLA tracked in the two to three paths, fanned to the five path entering the lane while ranging up to a clear
MUCHMORETHANREADY, bid in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner rival in the final furlong. MUCHMORETHANREADY broke out and snagged
the outer half of the gate upon leaving it, stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, bid around the far turn, led at the quarter pole, shifted out to
the four path to meet DREWSILLA's outer bid in upper stretch, but yielded to that foe and an inner bidder leaving midstretch. BAYOU BEAUTY took a bump
from an outer rival at the start, sped clear into the first turn while well in hand, but was headed turning for home, and gave way. SADIE'S PORT stalked
along the inside, but faded around the far turn. STARSHIP NOLA hopped slightly while off a step slow, and never got involved. TAP IRON FIST leaned in
and bumped a rival at the start, and showed little thereafter.

Footnotes
BUTTON BOY tracked two wide, shifted five wide and outside of the leaders in upper stretch, rallied in pursuit of a clear APPEAL DENIED in midstretch,
ranged up to that foe entering the final sixteenth, dueled through the closing stages, and forged an advantage in the shadow of the wire. APPEAL DENIED
stalked outside of the leading trio, steadily inched closer around the turn to bid at the five sixteenths pole, drove clear in upper stretch, dug in to resist an
outer rival's bid in the final furlong, dueled gamely while pulling away from the rest thereafter, but was caught nearing the wire. CHARLIE'S CREED vied
three wide, then from between horses turning for home as an outer rival loomed a danger, failed to match strides with that one and another wide bidder in
upper stretch, then held show thereafter. VALE sparred for the lead between a pair of rivals down the backstretch, led narrowly from a pair of outer foes
turning for home after their inner counterpart gave way, but delayed his lead change until the three sixteenths pole, and faltered in the process.
COURTHOUSE COVE dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals while under light coaxing down the backstretch, but failed to sustain that position
approaching the three furlong pole, chased from behind the leaders entering the lane, but gave way while hanging on his left lead. FRENCH COMPOSER
lacked speed in the two path, fanned to the five path entering the lane, but lacked a rally. PRINCE OF GLORY bobbled slightly at the start, shifted down
from the five path to the three path while at the rear entering the bend, but was eased around the turn.

SOFT PANTS was able to have the lead early, continued to lead down the back side and through the turn, was brought out in deep stretch to ensure the
others would pass and finished gamely. WOLF HUNTER settled in the second tier, chased the leader down the backside, was within striking distance for a
moment going into the turn, battled with other foe down the lane where he came out a bit, could never catch the leader but was able to secure the place
spot. COAL BOSS settled into the second tier followed the leader through out, battled down the lane for second where he was moved out a bit by foe and
was out finished. HONEY'S HOPE settled off the pace from the inside early, was in contention at the three eighths pole, but tired down the lane. THE
JOCKEY OF COAL BOSS CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF WOLF HUNTER FOR ALLEDGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER
A STEWARTS REVIEW THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED. THE QUARTER MILE FRACTION WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
PRO OXIDANT stalked two wide, prompted from between horses in the three path around the bend, bid turning for home, led entering the lane, inched clear
under mild urging after changing leads leaving the three sixteenths pole, and held sway while being ridden out. BROKEN RIB took back from crowded
quarters between horses soon after the start, tracked three wide, pressed in the four path around the turn, bid turning for home, but failed to keep pace with
an inner counterpart in upper stretch, and ran on to be second best. SUTHERLAND set the pace in the two path, clung to an advantage from a pair of outer
bidders turning for home, got headed at the quarter pole, gave way leaving the three sixteenths marker, and held show thereafter. COLTONATOR stalked
along the inside, failed to progress in upper stretch before altering course outwardly at the furlong grounds, and only offered a mild kick. MAGNOLIA
MIDNIGHT raced at the rear along the inside, but steadied hard behind a foe inside the five furlong pole, checked severely again while trailing approaching
the half mile pole, shifted two wide and between horses at the three furlong marker, swung to the five path entering the lane, but lacked a rally. ALEBRIJE
tracked two wide and from between horses, but checked to the rear entering the turn, shifted out to the five soon after, got floated to the six path entering
the lane, and gave way.

FANNIE AND FREDDIE settled off of the pace along the inside, inched closer two wide to be behind the leading flight turning for home, smoothly split those
foes three wide entering the lane once NON VIOLENCE drifted to part the sea, took aim on the leading pair in upper stretch, bid at the three sixteenths pole,
and kicked clear at the furlong grounds. MYTOWN MYRULES vied two wide and between horses into the first turn, rated back to stalk nearing the
backstretch, pursued from the two path thereafter, chased from the rail around the far turn, got outmoved by outer foes turning for home to trail the field
entering the lane, yet altered course four wide while picking up stride approaching midstretch, and rallied to claim place late. H. T. XENA dueled for the lead
along the inside, pressed around the far turn, fought on through midstretch, but failed to keep pace with an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, and lost
place late. NOT SO CLOSE bumped an outer rival at the start, vied three to two wide, led around the far turn, but weakened between horses at the furlong
grounds. ZING trailed, attempted to circle rivals with a five wide rally around the far turn, but failed to menace while being floated to the eight path entering
the lane, and ran on. MARINA'S GOLD tracked five to four wide, chased from between horses around the far turn, got herded to the seven path by an inner
rival entering the lane, and tired. NON VIOLENCE took a bump from an inner rival at the start, stalked forwardly in the four to three path, pursued from
striking range between horses around the far turn, but drifted to the six path entering the lane, and weakened.

RISING EMPIRE tracked from midpack in the two path, gained three wide into the far turn to stalk the top pair, failed to progress while hanging on his left
lead in upper stretch, yet offered a grinding charge to range up in the final furlong, bid entering the final sixteenth, and edged clear. BURNING BRIGHT set
the pace inside of a vying rival, shook free of him in upper stretch, but was caught in the final sixteenth. FORTUITY vied for the lead two wide, but failed to
keep pace entering the lane, and was outkicked for place by an outer rival at the furlong grounds. ARTIE'S RUMOR settled off of the pace along the inside,
but awaited racing room behind traffic in the two to three paths around the far turn, shifted out at the three sixteenths pole, and stayed on to gain a minor
share. FREEDOM'S WAY laid off of the pace two wide, improved three wide around the far turn, but leveled off without reaching contention. MONITION
stalked two wide, but was outmoved by the eventual winner into the far turn, pursued from between horses around that bend, but steadily gave way. NEW
YEAR SURPRISE trailed, took the far turn four wide, and failed to factor. BIZZEE CHANNEL stalked along the inside, but weakened around the far turn,
and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
KEYS INCLUDED pressed along the inside, switched outside of the leader entering the lane, bid in midstretch, and edged away late. KIDYOUNOT set the
pace in the three path, cleared entering the lane, but was surpassed by an outer rival at the furlong grounds, and held place. STOCKPILER laid off of the
pace in the three path, gained in the four to five paths around the far turn, and stayed on late, but ran out of ground to reach place. TROPHY DADDY
stalked in the four to two paths around the first turn, then from the three path around the far turn, but weakened in the four path in upper stretch while
hanging on his left lead. MAX PANDOWDY tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted to the three path entering the lane, and chased from between
horses. MACHO MARK veered outwardly after breaking multiple lengths slow, lagged behind around both turns, then stayed on. DA GOLD ROOM failed to
sustain midpack position around the first turn, saved ground off of the pace around the far turn, and to no avail. VALIANT DEFENDER bobbled a bit at the
start, lacked speed in the three to two paths, and failed to factor. MINISTRY OF ART tracked in the three to four paths, but weakened between horses
entering the lane.
