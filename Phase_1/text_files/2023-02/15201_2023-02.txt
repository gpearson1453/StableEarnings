MEAN SHARON sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, increased her margin into the lane and held sway to the wire. BIG CYN was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. TIZ TENACIOUS lacked early speed, raced four-wide
through the turn and finished evenly late. AMERICAN ROYALTY lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and was not a
factor. CHICKS DIG MUNNY settled off the leaders from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. RAGING LADY chased the
leaders from the inside and weakened after going three furlongs.

Footnotes
ALLEVA was bumped at the start then hustled along to duel for the lead with LONELY PRIVATE from off the rail, drifted out through the lane while vying
with that rival and held gamely to prevail. LONELY PRIVATE was away in good order to duel for the lead with the winner while racing three-wide, was
carried out by that rival through the stretch but could not get by through the vigorous drive. KELLER'S GOLD was reserved just off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the sixteenth pole and failed to gain in the drive. FASCINATED showed no early speed, raced six-wide through
the turn and lacked the needed rally. PERFECT FANNY was bumped at the break, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and
weakened in the drive. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERNING THE DRIFTING OUT OF ALLEVA THROUGH THE STRETCH AND
AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
GOLDEN HALO broke sharply to press the pace of dueling leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command with a sixteenth to run and drew
clear. CAMDEN HIGH settled off the leaders early, angled out into the lane and was up for the place. SHE'S A BOSSY GIRL set a pressured pace from off
the rail and gave way through the final sixteenth. JEWEL OF DENIAL was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with some
late run. LIP'S OF WINE lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and did not threaten. BETTY'S BAR pressed the pace from the inside and gave
way after going three furlongs. LOVELY LOLA was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TRINNI
SUNSET was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

TRUMPED was away in good order to duel for the lead with A VIEW FROM ABOVE while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run
and drew off with complete authority. TOIL AND TROUBLE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not gain on the
winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. A VIEW FROM ABOVE broke sharply to dispute the pace from the inside with the winner and gave
way through the final furlong. ABRAAJ MIRAGE lacked early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and finished evenly. WEARENOTBADPEOPLE was
void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and did not threaten. PHOENICIAN GHOST settled off the leaders
early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. IN THE MIDST lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
BELLE MY BELLE lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, responded when set down for the drive and wore down GRANDIOSE SUMMER to
be going away late. GRANDIOSE SUMMER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied with
KEEPONROCKINMEBABY, opened a clear margin into the lane but could not resist the winner late. ANGRY EMMY settled off the leaders early, moved
three-wide through the turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished with a belated bid. VALDINI was off slow, raced unhurried early,
moved four-wide through the turn and finished with late energy. KEEPONROCKINMEBABY set a pressured pace, responded when challenged nearing the
quarter and gave way in the drive. DREAMINGOFBLING pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. DEELITEFUL LIZZY
was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. RACE ORIGINALLY HAND-TIMED, TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.
