Footnotes
PEPPER MILL was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths marker, re-bid with a furlong to run,
vied with ANOTHER TEN and held off the closing JAMIES INHERITANCE to prevail. JAMIES INHERITANCE was reluctant to load, raced unhurried early,
moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths marker, stayed on well in the drive and finished with good late energy. ANOTHER TEN broke
sharply to duel for the lead from between foes, angled in with a furlong to run, vied and gave way late. GLIMPSE OF GOLD disputed the pace from the
inside, angled out in mid-stretch and again with a sixteenth to run and gave way. COASTLINE HOTTIE was off slow, raced just off the leaders early, moved
up five-wide to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, led and weakened through the final furlong.

SPEEDY GIGI broke sharply to duel for the lead with AMAAZA from the inside, opened a clear margin into the stretch and drew off with complete authority.
COLLECTING STARS showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with good energy. AMAAZA was away in good order to dispute
the pace while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. STRADARI was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and
failed to rally. DAZZLING MIST was off slow, settled off the leaders from off the rail and did not reach contention. RAGING LADY lacked early foot, raced
four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

HIGH FLYIN TIGER stalked the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to take command with a quarter to run, opened a clear margin and held off the
closing TRUTH TO POWER to prevail. TRUTH TO POWER was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady
late rally. THIRSTY KISS off step slow, raced unhurried early, raced off the rail through the second turn and finished with good energy. BEL RAGAZZO was
bumped soon after the start, lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished with a belated bid. TRIBUTE TO AFLEET was forwardly
placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. PHILIPIE FAST sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and
weakened through the final furlong. HANKY PRANKY was bumped and checked nearing the seven-eighths pole, raced three-wide through the second turn
and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
CHEST CANDY appeared hard to rate, tracked the leaders from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, opened a clear margin into the
stretch and held LOYALTY SPIRIT safe in the drive. LOYALTY SPIRIT was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside, with MANY ROSES,
stayed on well in the drive but could not reach the winner late. PASSED BY PAUL settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn
reached a striking position but failed to gain late. ARIZONA JEREMY lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further in
mid-stretch and finished evenly late. OSTINI checked at the start, unhurried early, moved six-wide through the second turn and did not menace. MANY
ROSES disputed the pace with LOYALTY SPIRIT and weakened after going six furlongs. BOURBON TAN settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide
through the second turn and weakened. MY CALL raced off the pacesetters from the inside and gradually weakened. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE raced off the
leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out nearing the quarter, was checked then eased through the lane. ADDED MISSING
