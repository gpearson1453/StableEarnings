ADIEU ACES rushed up the rail to be off the pace on the backstretch then slipped through into the turn and drew clear. A SOLDIER'S WAY tracked the
leaders through the turn then moved out to three wide at the eighth pole to be best of the rest. SKIPPA broke in and jockey lost iron, then made a four wide
looming bid around the turn to rally and be up for the show. COUNTRY CAT JAKE pressed the pace from four wide and weakened.
ASTROLOGYSPROTEGE went to the early led down the backstretch and chased the winner home. CARLOS' BLAST raced in the middle of the pack,
made a four wide bid at the five sixteenths pole and gave way. APRIORITY ROCKET raced near the back on the backstretch then made a three to four wide
bid on the turn but failed to menace. ALL COUNTRY was off the pace early then retreated. ZIPPY TOGA was close up early then dropped back.

MONITOR MILLS set the pace while leading throughout and was kept to task in the stretch. IDE LIKE HAWAII raced in the middle of the pack down the
backstretch then moved out to three wide at the quarter pole and was gaining on the winner but was too late. CLEVER PRINCE saved round while racing in
the middle of the pack and proved best of the rest. MR. SNOWFLAKE tracked the leader to the quarter pole and gave way. SABER STORM false broke and
popped the gate prior to the start then was off a step slow and was rushed up, raced three to four wide giving an even effort. K R TARGET was not a factor.
TOOCAN DANCE was not a threat.

ANN'S STORM tracked the leaders through the final turn then split horses at the top of the stretch and cleared late. JUST A WIN was off the pace down the
backstretch then moved to three wide at the quarter pole and held the place. SARATOGA PASODOBLE bumped RYAN'S GRACE at the start then pressed
the pace from the two path to the final turn, took the lead at the quarter pole and fought gamely down the stretch. ANGEL AND ME was bumped by
DIAMOND INDY SKIES going into the first turn, raced near the back around the first turn, moved three wide at the half pole to be in the middle of the pack,
moved out to four wide in upper stretch but missed the show. RYAN'S GRACE was bumped hard at the start by SARATOGA PASODOBLE, then was
allowed to settle through the final turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. SAVANNAH'S HERE ran off in the post parade, went to a pressured lead from
the inside to the five sixteenths pole and gave way. DIAMOND INDY SKIES bumped with ANGEL AND ME going into the first turn then raced in the middle
of the pack down the backstretch, started to go between horses and lacked room, was taken up and galloped in.

Footnotes
MASTERLY vied for the lead around the fist turn then took the lead at the half pole and inched away, drew clear on the final turn and proved best. MISTY'S
FOOL was allowed to settle around the first turn then made a three to four wide bid at the five sixteenths pole for a late rally and was just up for the place.
CONGA BOY was hustled along to take the early pace around the first turn then was forwardly placed to the upper stretch and weakened but just missed
the place. ANDIAMO GIACOMO saved ground through the final turn then made a mild bid but was empty. DEBONNAIRE DUDE stalked the pace from
three wide to the three sixteenths pole and gave way. BROAD DECISION was unhurried down the backstretch, made a rail bid on the final turn but was
never a factor. GUILTY AGAIN was four wide into the first turn then settled in the middle of the pack to the three eighths pole and dropped back.
