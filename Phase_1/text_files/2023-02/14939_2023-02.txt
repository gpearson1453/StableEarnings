Footnotes
COPTER was bumped by REDDINGANDLEE at the start then was hustled to take the lead at the seven sixteenths pole and pulled away. STEAUXLIT
broke in slightly at the start, was placed off the pace on the inside down the backstretch then made a two wide bid at the quarter pole but was no match for
the winner. BLEEP BLEEP tracked the leaders down the backstretch from the three path then made a four wide bid at the quarter pole for a late run and
prove best of the rest. REDDINGANDLEE lost the rider in the post parade, veered in and bumped COPTER at the start, raced near the back down the
backstretch then made a rail bid on the turn for a late rally. K R POWER STORM broke out but had the brief early speed then pressed the pace to the
quarter pole and weakened. SETTLE ON SOMETHIN hopped out of the gate then was raced in the middle of the pace and was not a threat. ZAPAWAY
chased the leaders and was not a factor. THE BOYZ REAL DEAL was off slow and remained back.

HALF FULL rushed to a clear lead, and proved best. RANCH WATER raced near the back to the turn, moved up around the turn then split horses in mid
stretch but was too late. HOOSIER raced in the middle of the pack through the turn then moved out to four wide in upper stretch and closed well.
BLINDEDBYTHEGEES stalked the pace around the turn then moved out to three wide in upper stretch but was empty. FLASHY BOY was unsettled in the
gate, broke out at the start then tracked the leaders to the turn made a three wide bid but tired in the stretch. MOR BIG LEE was fractious in the gate then
hopped at the start, raced back to the top of the stretch, gave late effort to improve position. BLACKTECA was fractious in the gate then settled in the middle
of the pack on the inside but was not a threat. EMPIRE KID pressed the pace to the five sixteenths pole and retreated.

ZYDECO MUSIC was roused to a clear lead to set all the pace and held off outside rival for the win. A WISH FOR MADELYN was placed off the pace down
the backstretch then launched her bid at the three sixteenths pole and gained late on the winner but was not enough. TINCANDANCE was allowed to settle
around the first turn then moved up from the three path on the backstretch and around the final turn for a long drive to be up for the show. OUR LITTLE
GIRL saved ground while advancing through the final turn then moved out to three wide in upper stretch but was empty. GEORGIA DAWN pressed the pace
to the first turn then tracked the leader to the quarter pole and gave way. SAVVY SHIPMAN was allowed to settle around the first turn then made a rail bid
down the backstretch and flattened out. EMMAS RULER was unhurried around the first turn and was always back. CARLOS LOVES TEE stalked the pace
to the three eighth pole then dropped back.

D'WILD MUFFIN dueled in the second flight to the five sixteenth pole then settled in the middle of the pack around the turn and moved out to three to four
wide in upper stretch for a late run and drew clear late. BUILDING HOME dueled in the second flight to the five sixteenth pole then launched her bid around
the turn and took the lead at the sixteenth pole but was out finished. ITSNOTMYJOB dueled for the early lead to the seven sixteenths pole, pressed the
pace from the three path to the five sixteenths pole then chased the leader to mid stretch and gave way. SEE SASSY RUN was off a step slow and roused
to make a four wide bid at the three eighths to improve position. FIRE OF GOLD dueled for the early lead to the seven sixteenths pole then pulled away to a
clear lead to mid stretch and weakened. A. K. A. GRAMS raced near the back on the inside then moved up two or three wide on the turn then moved out to

FREEDOMFI was roused away from the gate then was allowed to settle around the first turn, moved up the rail through the final turn then moved out to two
wide in upper stretch and ran down the leader to be up in final strides. DOCTOR LEO set the unchallenged pace with a clear lead to deep stretch and was
nailed. GUITAR SLIM tracked the leader from the two path down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the final turn to be best of the rest. BAYOU JAM
stalked the pace from the three path to the quarter pole and lacked a late response. PINCH ASSAULT was within striking distance from the two path to the
quarter pole and gave way. TAKEN BACK remained back.

Footnotes
JACK HAMMER was placed off the pace around the first turn then pressed the pace down the backstretch from the two path to the quarter pole then dueled
around the turn and was bumped by MARKS PROMISE when he floated out entering the stretch, took the lead at the eighth pole and fought gamely but was
able to draw clear late. MARKS PROMISE went to the lead to set most of the pace to the quarter pole then dueled around the turn, floated out entering the
stretch and bumped JACK HAMMER then battled to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. KING'S LUTE stalked the pace from the three path around the
final turn and chased the top two home. THE BOSS SOSS was allowed to settle down the backstretch from off the rail then moved up around the final turn
but only passed tiring rivals. GOBOT broke in at the start then was pinched back early and was never a threat. LATE SEPTEMBER raced in the middle of
the pack from two or three path around the first turn, made a mild bid into the final turn but failed to menace. A MILLION STARS saved ground while racing
in the middle of the pack to the quarter pole and gave way. JOCKEY OBJECTION, JOCKEY OF MARKS PROMISE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE
JOCKEY OF JACK HAMMER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENC ENTERING THE STRETCH, AFTER A STEWARDS REVIEW THE CLAIM OF FOUL WAS
DISALLOWED AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

and was kept to task in the drive. WINNING ROMANCE went to the early lead around the first turn then vied for the lead down the backstretch, made a
rebid in upper stretch to gain on the leader but proved second best. A G'S CHARLOTTE was positioned off the pace around the first turn then moved up to
challenge leader at the five sixteenths pole and chased winner home. FORT POLK stalked the pace from the three path but failed to menace. EILEEN
ALEXANDRA was unhurried down the backstretch then made a rail bid around the final turn to improve position. LUTIE MO was full of run to the first turn
and had to steady before the turn then was allowed to settle down the backstretch but was never a threat. FINAL QUEST was close up early while saving
ground, had to steady in the first turn but was never a factor.

final turn and split horses in the final sixteenth to be a clear second. BALLINONABUDJET raced in the middle of the pack through the first turn then
advanced up the backstretch and made a four wide bid at the five sixteenth pole but was out finished. HIGHLAND CREEK tracked the leaders from the two
path but lacked a late response. LANGS DAY was allowed to settle around the first turn and down the backstretch then made a mild bid on the final turn and
passed tiring rivals. BRIAN'S IRON MIKE went to a clear lead around the first turn then was challenged at the five sixteenths pole and stopped. JIMI'S A
STAR was never involved. RUNNINGINTHEMONEY stalked the pace to the first turn and was done, distanced, jogged in, walked off.
