Footnotes
R ROSE' ALL DAY prompted the pace between foes from the two path around the first turn and was in the three path down the backstretch, was cued right
handed around the far turn and took aim in the four path at the top of the lane, bid for the lead passing the eighth pole, and edged past the inner pacesetter
late to win. WHAT'S GOOD set the pace along the inside, was roused in the two path turning into the stretch, dug in under left handed urging into the final
furlong, but was caught by an outer foe late to place. GOOD VALUE chased in the three path around the first turn and was in the four path down the
backstretch, tipped out and was coaxed from the five path into the far turn, brushed with an inner foe and was out in the nine path entering the lane, and ran
on to get up for show. NAA DUDETTE was along the rail around the first turn and rated in the three path down the backstretch, angled out to the eight path
and brushed with an outer foe at the top of the stretch, and stayed on. LEIPZIG brushed with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the three path, was roused
in the two path into the far turn, shifted out to the five path into the lane, but finished evenly. NO WASABI FOR ME was prominent in the three path around
the first turn and up close in the four path down the backstretch, was driven from said position into the lane but was outrun in the final furlong. MO TOUGH
stalked in the two path, was ridden along the inside around the far turn but was short of room at the top of the lane, and was one paced. GRATIA trailed into
the stretch and never threatened. KITTENZEN brushed with an outer foe at the start, was reserved in the four path down the backstretch and was no
menace.

MACHTENHAIRONFIRE set a clear pace along the rail and held well clear under a drive. KAEKO settled off the early pace inside, moved into a clear
second two wide around the turn and was clearly second best in the lane. LITTLE BELITA gave chase four wide, lacked the needed rally and stayed on for
the show. BEAUTIFUL STAR chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. QUEEN CUPID had only brief speed three wide. MIA'S
AUTHORITY trailed inside.

Footnotes
OLD TOWN ROAD prompted the early pace along the inside, patiently waited along the rail around the turn and was cued thru an opening at the top of the
lane, bid passing the eighth pole, and drew past the outer pacesetter nearing the sixteenth pole to win. BEN COPENHAGEN set the pace in the two path,
was roused while shifting inside around the turn, floated out to the three path into the stretch, lost the lead approaching the final sixteenth, and ran on to
hold place. POUND GREEN tracked in the two path, was cued in the three path around the turn and shifted out to the six path into the stretch, and kept on
for show. FROLIC MAN stalked in the four path, took aim in the three path around the turn and was driven in the five path into the lane, and evened out in
the final furlong. SILENT CHAOS trailed in the two path early and shifted to the rail into the turn, was roused passing the three-eighths pole and tipped out
to the six path into the stretch, but was no factor. LONG BEACH KID rated in the four path but was no menace in the eight path in the stretch.

Footnotes
FOXY LADY stalked the pace in the four path, steadily gained through the lane and was up in deep stretch. DRINKS ON ME dueled outside of AUNT
NADINE while racing in three path, edged clear around the turn then fought on inside of the winner to lead until deep stretch. DANCING DOLL chased the
pace in the two path, tipped out in upper stretch and finished willingly for the show. DANGER settled off the pace while racing three wide, angled four wide
in upper stretch and had a mild rally. FRANKLY MY DEAR broke outwardly and bumped AUNT NADINE at the start, raced four wide and never threatened.
AUNT NADINE was bumped at the start, sped to the front, vied in the two path early, dropped back around the turn and continued to fade inside in the lane.
ISLAND MAGIC played no factor while racing five wide. SAMMY'S TOWN was outrun inside.

Footnotes
SPY NOVEL was bumped by an inner foe into an outer foe leaving the gate, tracked in the two path, was patiently handled inside of rivals around the far
turn and was cued while angling out to the six path into the lane, bid while tipping inwards nearing the eighth pole, took over in the final furlong, and drew
clear. MISTER ABARRIO broke out and bumped an outer foe, trailed in the the two path around the first turn but was steadied while tipping out to the four
path down the backstretch, tipped back into the two path around the far turn, was roused from the four path into the stretch, was herded inwards and
bumped between foes passing the eighth pole, tipped back out to the four path and bumped with an outer foe again just after, and ran on for place. THE
KHOZAN ONE was brushed by an inner foe just after the start, prompted the pace in the three path around the first turn and into the backstretch, was cued
to bid in the two path around the far turn and floated out to the five path into the lane, floated back in and bumped an inner foe passing the eighth pole, then
shifted back out and bumped an outer foe just after, and kept on for show. CANAL stalked in the four path, was coaxed in the three path rounding the far
turn, swung out to the seven path into the stretch, was bumped by an inner foe just past the eighth pole, and evened out soon after. RIGHT ON RICHIE
bumped with an outer foe at the start, set the pace along the inside, was roused from the rail into the far turn, tipped out to the two path at the top of the
stretch, and was bumped by an outer foe while yielding passing the eighth pole. COACH ABERNATHY got bumped by an inner foe into an outer foe at the
start, then was checked into the first turn and was wellback in the two path into the backstretch, and never threatened from the three path in the stretch.
BEACHMONT CHARLIE bumped with an inner foe at the start and brushed an outer foe just after, rated in the four path but was no menace in the six path
thru the stretch. AN OBJECTION WAS LODGED BY THE RIDER OF CANAL AGAINST THE RIDER OF MISTER ABARRIO AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION
BY THE RIDER OF MISTER ABARRIO AGAINST THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, WERE BOTH REVIWED BY THE
STEWARDS AND NO CHANGES WERE MADE.

TIME PASSAGE pressed the pace three wide, took over nearing the quarter pole and drove clear in midstretch. OH DARLIN disputed the pace two wide
between foes, was no match for the winner in the lane but kept on to be a clear second. HOAX raced off the pace four wide and was along for the show.
CLAY SOLDIER tracked the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. JOLLY MISS JILL chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. OLGA
bobbled at the start, three wide and never threatened. EXPLOSIVE EXCHANGE hit the starting gate, sped forward to the set pace along the rail and tired in
the drive. MISS VYVYANNE was outrun inside.

Footnotes
JOURNEYTOTHEMOON brushed with an outer foe at the start and was unhurried in the three path, was roused in the six path around the far turn and
ranged up to bid at the top of the lane, took the lead into the final furlong and drew clear. JAZZY T stalked in the four path, was coaxed to bid in the five path
passing the quarter pole, but was outrun by the outer eventual winner in the stretch, and ran on for place. SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT brushed with an inner
foe at the start, raced prominently from the three path around the first turn and was in the four path down the backstretch, bid from said position into the far
turn and took a narrow lead into the stretch, but was outrun by a pair of outer foes to finish with show. MOSLER'S IMAGE tracked in the three path, was
cued around the far turn while tipping out to the six path into the stretch, but was one paced. STREAKING GREY was fractious in the gate and threw her
head at the start, trailed in the three path early, was asked rounding the far turn, but was no factor from the six path in the stretch. GREY CHARLOTTE set
the pace in the two path, was coaxed along the rail into the far turn, but gaveway nearing the quarter pole, was pulled up after the race and vanned off.
KENTUCKY PRIDE rated along the inside but was no menace.

NARUTO settled off the early pace inside, angled four wide nearing the turn, advanced four wide around the bend, continued on the left lead in the lane,
closed under left-handed urging and was up and clear late. ROLL ON BIG JOE dueled inside for a half, drew clear near the five-sixteenths pole, drifted out
under right-handed urging in the lane and was collared leaving the sixteenth pole. RUDDER'S MEN broke awkwardly, chased the pace three wide, could not
quite keep while under urging around the turn, angled further out in upper stretch and was along late for the show. DIAMOND COOL was bumped at the
start, raced off the pace two wide, made progress in upper stretch then flattened out and lost third late. KNOX was bumped at the start, raced well back four
wide and rallied belatedly. APOCALYPSO failed to menace while racing five wide. HARD TO HANDLE saved ground well back, angled out in upper stretch
and failed to menace. BRING THEBAND HOME was bumped between foes at the start, pressed the pace two wide and faltered late on the turn. CAJUN

bend and retreated through the lane.

to range up and took aim from the seven path into the stretch, and drew past inner rivals in the final furlong to win. NEOGEM brushed with an outer foe at
the start, rated along the inside of rivals, was roused around the far turn and in the three path at the top of the lane, was short of room and in tight and
squeezed thru an opening along the inside while brushing an inner foe passing the eighth pole, and ran on for place. LITERATE was between rivals in the
two path around the first turn and settled off the pace in the four path down the backstretch, was roused passing the quarter pole and in the five path at the
top of the stretch, but was stymied nearing the eighth pole and had to alter course out to the center inside the final furlong, and kept on for show. STUCK IN
MALIBU was unhurried along the inside, angled out while under a ride around the far turn and was in the eight path entering the lane, and stayed on down
the center. BOTH SIDES stalked in the four path, was ridden around the far turn and fanned out to the six path entering the stretch, bid nearing the eighth
pole, but flattened out. CONNECTING FLIGHT prompted the pace in the three path around the first turn and in the four path down the backstretch, was
roused to bid in the three path into the far turn, took a narrow lead and was cued right handed from the four path at the top of the lane, but yielded in the
final furlong. ACQUIRED TASTE was in the two path around the first turn and tracked in the three path down the backstretch, tipped in the two path around
