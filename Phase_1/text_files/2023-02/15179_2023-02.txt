CROSS EXAMINE Trailed lackadaisically along the rail early, prodded with the crop multiple times into the first turn, engaged with rider in move to the
backstretch, commenced run at the three-eighths, switched to clear air three wide past the three-sixteenths pole, moved to five path for stretch drive, surged
to overtake longtime leader one hundred yards out, finished full of run. BAKERSFIELD BABE Vied inside for the lead into first turn, shrugged off first rival at
the three-eighths pole, brushed the other off at the quarter pole, opened up on rivals around bend while shifting to the three path into the stretch, willingly
battled but was passed at the sixteenth pole. CLASSIC CALIFORNIA Tracked on inner into first turn sitting behind leading trio, advanced up the rail at the
five-sixteenths pole, moved in tandem with eventual winner into the lane, move mitigated by top two down the stretch. DYNAMIC WOMAN Well off the pace
opening stages, settled four path in backside run, asked at quarter pole, never fired, only passed tiring. LUCKY LUPE Three wide into first turn, engaged to
duel for lead at seven-sixteenths pole, the brief challenge was shrugged off by foe at the quarter pole, gave way, not asked in run to line. WEST COAST
ANDY Two wide between while dueling into first turn, struggled to keep pace, retreated at three-eighths pole, not persevered with.

JUSTIN'S LADY Assumed lead on rail, always looked a winner, never gave rivals a chance while always keeping them at bay, in hand. SHORT JOURNEY
Broke a touch slow but quickly moved up to sit off leader two wide, was no match for leader who stepped away at quarter pole, finished well, clearly second
best. SHACKEY'S LOVE Stalked three wide throughout, moved up on turn, no match for winner, outfinished. WITCHES DANCE Tracked in pocket in run to
first turn, maintained position to quarter pole, let top trio get away around bend after being set down at the five-sixteenths, moved to the three path for
stretch run, hardly a threat. PIRATE MISCHIEF Settled off the pace early in the three path, made a mild move at the three-eighths pole that bore little
benefit, three wide into the second turn, never in touch with those who beat him. BELLA VINO Lagged, asked to keep up throughout, always outrun.

GOLD STAR STUDENT Bobbled break but quickly engaged to the lead, never pressured while travelling on rail, coasted. MANY AMBITIONS Three wide
into first turn, maintained position between pair of rivals in run up backside, chased after leader after shaking off adjoined foes, moved to rail for drive, a
clear second best. ROMEO'S GLORY Taken back along the rail, tracked comfortably off the lead well on the bridle, commenced rally at the five-sixteenths
pole, shifted to the three path for the stretch run, gained belatedly. NUMMY NUM Two wide for first turn run, ran in line of three on the backside, packed it in
at the quarter pole. PREDETERMINATION Settled four path in rear, passed one tiring rival. ADRIENNE'S PROGENY Four wide first turn, outside of three
rivals on backside run, gave way at the five-sixteenths pole.
