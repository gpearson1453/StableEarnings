rallied while coming on late. TALLESTOFTHETALL unhurried early, rallied outside to quarter pole and also coming on too late. ARTEMUS EAGLE good
position, dueled to far turn but was used up and weakened in the stretch run. ORAZIO between foes to quarter pole with good position inside through the
stretch with a fade. SEMI CHARMED DAY good position to the half, began to fade back from the far turn. TOP CREDENTIALS show speed early on,
dueled, gave way badly in the stretch. DRAFT CAPITAL BORE OUT BUMPING INTO TORNADO BOY JUST BEFORE THE WIRE, FOR THAT ACTION

PELLETIER raced back to far turn, rallied along close to rail late to improve position stretch. DANCE THE DAY AWAY close up throughout, outside run to
far turn, could not improve. MEMPHIS CASH QUEEN chased pace dueled to the half, short lead far turn, faltered. CLEVER TALE hustled from the gate
stayed close from inside to half, stopped. SAN NICOLA STAR never menaced throughout. HERO OF THE BEST dueled to the half, headed quarter pole,

Footnotes
KINISON good position to far turn while wide, drifted out and impeded rival in the upper stretch run and held on. LIAM THE BRAVE unhurried to far turn off
rail, made the widest run, rallied in earnest while impeded in the stretch run and settled for place. OFF THE CUFF inside speed to the front stayed on well in
the stretch, outgamed. TAP THE CANDY raced along evenly from inside with no late kick when needed. BOCO raced along evenly to far turn, very wide into
stretch, improved. MY FAVORITE UNCLE bit slow from gate, raced back to far turn and only improved late. VERSATILE unhurried to the half, rallied turn,
widest into stretch, evenly. BIGGIE off rail position never far back to far turn, weakened into lane. OFF THE CHARTS raced along evenly with no response
when needed. VAIL OF HONOR never menaced. HABITUS never threatened at any pole. HAP'S VICTORY chased leader to far turn, could not go on and
stopped badly. Following a stewards inquiry and a jockey objection it was found that KINISON did in fact come out in the stretch run and impede the foward
progress of LIAM THE BRAVE in final furlong.
