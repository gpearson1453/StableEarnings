handed crop urging. GRATITUDE ATTITUDE was allowed to settle early, advanced four wide on the turn and came five wide into the lane and finished well
to be clearly second best. MAGNETIC CHARM pressed the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid to draw clear on the turn, but weakened in the final
