Footnotes
BON DIA led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and kicked clear in the lane. ZIP CODE ENVY tracked the leader on the
outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn, could not go with the winner in the lane and chased that rival home.
CLASSIC DREAMER hit the gate leaving it, settled in the middle of the pack through the opening stages, raced in the four path around the turn, began a bid
passing the quarter pole and improved position mildly in the stretch. BONNIE SANDRA raced off the pace on the outside early, navigated the bend from the
three and four path and finished evenly. NOBLE ATTITUDE bumped mildly with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leader up
the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and weakened in the lane. BEER BALI was bumped and shuffled back at the break, raced off the pace on
the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the bend and was empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
THATS ALL SHEWROTE dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch
and held that margin to the wire while drifting out late. RAIN OF BLESSING raced in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, began to
move up from the four path coming around the bend and continued to gain ground late in the stretch. SONG OF THE HEART dueled between horses up the
backstretch, chased the leaders from the four path around the turn, was outkicked in the lane and kept on to the finish. FEEL LIKE GUESSING stalked the
pace setters on the outside through the early going, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing
evenly. SONGTELLER pressed the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, dropped back while racing in the two path around the turn and
faded from there. OSTARA trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. MY SONG AND MELODY hit the gate
leaving it, raced off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was empty in the stretch.

the five path around the far turn and gained ground to pull clear in late stretch. HOLD THE SPICE trailed the field from the two path around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, improved position from the four path coming around the far turn, continued to gain in the lane and
chased on to the wire. UNLEVERAGED raced in the two path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two
path around the second bend and kept on to the finish while drifting late. ALBIE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile,
continued around the far turn still in the two path and improved position mildly in the stretch. SAVAGE stumbled leaving the gate, raced in the four path
around the first turn, stalked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the five path and finished evenly. MARV'S MAGIC
raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the four path and passed tiring horses in the lane.
SIXTY ONE raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, came around the second bend still in the three
path and faded in the stretch. GOLDEN TONE raced in the three path early, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch,
navigated the far bend from the two path and flattened out from there. JOJO'S DREAM led the way on the inside around the first turn and up the
backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the far turn and tired in the stretch. KITTEN'S SPA raced in the two path early, continued up the

stretch and held that margin to the wrie. ELSINORE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued
around the far turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. ROMAN FLAME raced in the three path around the first
turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the second bend from the two path and kept on to the finish. BENGALA JOY raced in
the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and
improved position in late stretch. NEWTON'S STAR (IRE) saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, came around the far
turn in the three path and weakened in the final furlong. ENGLISHED was forced to check headed into the first turn when the horse in front of him stumbled,
saved ground from there, raced at the back of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the second turn from the three path and never threatened. COFFEE
HOUSE stumbled leaving the gate, raced off the pace in the two path through the opening half mile, continued around the second bend in the four path and
made no bid. MOST DIVINE stumbled badly while racing in the two path headed into the first turn, nearly losing her rider in the process, recovered and
trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and was not a factor. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE
INCIDENT HEADING INTO THE FIRST TURN. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

FATIMA'S BLESSING raced in the two path around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the
second turn in the four path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. FIERCE WARRIOR saved ground early, tracked the leader on
the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far bend and weakened late. J BERESFORD TIPTON hit the gate leaving it, raced in the
five path early, settled at the back of the pack for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and improved position mildly in the final
furlong. DREAM LINER (BRZ) hit the gate leaving it, saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace, came around the far
bend on the inside and made no bid. ON THE COUCH raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on
the outside, navigated the second turn still in the four path and flattened out from there. VAN DUSEN (GB) raced in the middle of the pack between horses
through the opening half mile, came around the second turn in the two path and was empty in the lane. AZURE SKY trailed the field throughout, raced in the
two and three paths around the turn and was not a factor.
