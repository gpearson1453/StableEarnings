Footnotes
RUNNINWITHTHEBOYZ cleared early and took control of the rail, set all the pace to the stretch, spurted away when asked with a furlong left to run and
remained well clear to the wire. CONTROL FUNCTION slipped in the back leaving the gate to come away last, raced off the pace outside rival, spun three
wide into the lane, tipped out and outkicked DENDERA for second. DENDERA pulled on the inside when trying to be reserved, got bumped by outer rival at
the three-eighths pole, tipped two wide with a quarter mile left to run, showed a mild rally when asked right then left handed and moving to the inside but got
edged for the place. TEEN DRAMA stalked three deep, took aim three wide into the stretch and lacked a bid. JIBBER JABBER (IRE) stalked between rivals
then in the two path and could not rally in the drive. ROCK THE BOURBON raced two wide at the back early, moved out on the far turn and came four wide
into the stretch and failed to menace. CHARLOTTE HARBOR stalked the speed from the rail, saved ground to the stretch and weakened.

NEVER SWAY pressed three deep early then chased past the half-mile pole, bid outside the leader around the far turn, took over leaving the bend, cleared
at the top of the stretch and held well in the final sixteenth under a drive. BIG BELL settled at the back early, advanced inside on the turn, moved out in
upper stretch and finished gamely for the place honors. BACK ON THE STREET tracked off the rail, got blocked behind rival early on the bend and tipped
out to the four path, put in a late run from the middle portion of the track and gained third. ADAM'S CREED stalked the pace from inside, tipped three wide
late on the turn and finished evenly in the furlong grounds. SHEMAKESCENTS set the pace inside a pair of rivals early then cleared at the half-mile pole,
pressured again by NEVER SWAY on the bend, lost command into the lane and weakened in the final eighth. PARCO chased the speed from outside,
rounded the bend in the three path, wen three to four wide into the lane and failed to respond. ASYLUM pressed the pace from between rivals early, chased
past the half-mile pole, dropped back around the bend and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
ARMY STAR stalked between then outside a rival, bid three then two wide outside the leader on the turn, took over into the stretch and inched away.
CROWNING GOLD bumped lightly at the start, dueled for command from outside, inched ahead leaving the backstretch, put away inner rival early on the
turn, fought inside ARMY STAR past the five-sixteenths pole, lost the lead entering the stretch but stayed on well from inside to prove second best.
CRYPTO RIDE brushed leaving the gate, stalked behind the top pair up the backstretch, rounded the bend two wide, could not threaten the leaders in the
late stages but held over GOLDENSPA for the show. GOLDENSPA sat off the pace outside rivals up the backstretch, moved closer four then three deep
around the bend and could not get by CRYPTO RIDE for the show honors. AMIGO G A got shuffled back shortly after the start, got bothered by inner rival
lugging out early, put in tight at the five-sixteenths pole, angled out into the stretch and failed to threaten. BLACK MAGICIAN broke out and brushed rival,
went up to duel from inside, lost touch with the top pair around the turn and gave way in the lane. TOP OF MY GAME shifted out early on the backstretch,
chased along the rail and steadied when in a bit tight at the five-sixteenths pole, continued along the rail to the stretch and failed to menace. MERIT SONG
bumped leaving the gate, tracked three wide around the turn, pulled up at the top of the stretch and walked into the van.

willingly for a minor award. PETRUCHIO sat off the pace on the inside, lacked room along the fence in upper stretch, altered off the rail then rallied between
foes but was too late. MISSED CALL chased three deep near the back into the turn, came five wide into the lane and failed to threaten. BRACE FOR
IMPACT dueled from outside to the turn, between foes past the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch run. RELAXED ARTIST (IRE) broke a step slow,

TIME TO PARTY stalked the pace along the rail, waited patiently behind the leader on the far turn, gained an opening entering the stretch, quickly took
control and cleared SILVER SURFER (GB) and held well over the runner-up. RECKLESS SPIRIT rated two to three wide early, chased between on the far
turn, tipped four wide into the lane, finished well but ran out of time. ALIGATO settled early on the inside, tipped two wide leaving the far turn and finished
willingly for the show. SILVER SURFER (GB) sped clear and crossed to the inside, pressured past the half-mile pole, vied inside through the far turn, came
off the rail into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and kept on through the final furlong to save a minor award. SARWAR (FR) was off a bit slow to
begin, trailed two wide early, moved closer into the far turn, angled out into the lane and bumped rival at the three-sixteenths pole and could not threaten in
the furlong grounds. ALTRUIST was closest in pursuit off the rail, bid between rivals at the seven-sixteenths pole, fought outside the leader on the far turn
and three wide into the lane and weakened. BALADI steadied slightly early when outer rival shifted ground, unhurried in the early going while moving inside,
lacked room on the far turn, went two wide into the stretch and failed to menace. REMOTE shifted ground early, settled in the two path, advanced three
wide up the backstretch, bid three deep at the seven-sixteenths pole, could not sustain the challenge around the bend, came five wide into the stretch then
got bumped at the three-sixteenths pole and weakened.

rounded the bend five wide and rallied for the show. MY HARBORS DREAM stalked four deep early, three deep on the turn and failed to produce a bid.
MURRAY stalked three deep, got shuffled back at the seven-sixteenths pole, trailed four wide into the lane and kept on to improve position. KRAHENBUHL
dueled for the lead from inside, fought back through the turn, then weakened in the lane. GOT THUNDER stalked the top trio from inside, raced a bit off the
rail into the drive and also weakened. LETSGETLUCKY broke a step slow in the beginning, chased between runners into and around the bend and tired

Footnotes
VALIANCER stalked outside a rival early, took aim three wide into the stretch, took over outside the eight pole and won going away. VEGAS BURNER set
the pace between foes early, bumped into the turn, dueled inside a rival on the turn, overtaken in upper stretch and stayed on to hold second. NUCLEAR
was off slow from outside, chased three wide around the turn and gained the show. BOSS SULLY broke a step slow, chased off the rail then started to pull
and became rank past the half-mile pole, chased four wide into the lane and lost the show. PRECISION STRIKE took an awkward step crossing over the
dirt, raced along the inside then two wide into the stretch and improved placings. CALM SEA pressed three deep early, bumped at the three-eighths pole,
dueled from outside around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. SURF AFFAIR was off slow in the beginning, trailed early then passed rivals into the
turn four wide, exited the bend five wide and failed to menace. AZURE STAR (IRE) showed early speed, bobbled crossing surfaces, pressed from inside
then chased leaving the backstretch and faded out of contention. IT'LL DO veered in leaving the gate, tugged at the back approaching the half-mile pole,
raced outside a rival into the turn, trailed two to three wide leaving the bend and tired.
