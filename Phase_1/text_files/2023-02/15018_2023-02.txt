Footnotes
ADORIAN settled off the early pace along the rail, tipped three wide midway around the far turn, came five wide into lane, closed outside and was up and
clear late. PHOBIA saved ground off the pace, made a rail bid in the lane, led near the sixteenth pole but was no match for the winner late. SILVER N
BLACK stalked the pace in the two path, was boxed in around the far turn, angled out and bumped BLUE MAVERICK turning for home, was still in tight
quarters between foes through much of the lane and was along for the show. MANA KAI set the pace in the two path to the sixteenth pole and weakened.
BLUE MAVERICK was very rank through the opening quarter-mile, raced up close three and four wide, was bumped turning for home and faded. CROWN
IN CHARGE was fractious in the gate, pressed the pace in the three path and tired through the final furlong. PONTI PRIDE saved ground and failed to
menace. SKYHOOK played no factor while racing three wide. HIGHLY UNLIKELY was outrun while racing two and three wide. JACK FLASH was outrun
inside. ZACH AND JILL was off slow, raced four wide and was through early.

Footnotes
NO DECAF had an awkward start and chased in the four path into the the turn, ranged up while floating out to the five path around the turn, bid from the six
path into the stretch, took the lead while drifting out to the center passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. KAEKO stalked in the three path, was roused
passing the three-eighths pole and bid from the four path into the stretch, and kept on for place. BEAUTIFUL STAR raced prominently between rivals in the
two path, lost ground around the turn and was under left handed urging in the five path entering the lane, and was one paced for show. PERFECT
PROVISION set the pace along the inside, was coaxed midway around the turn and tipped out to the two path into the stretch, but yielded going into the
final furlong. SOLAIR trailed around the five path into the turn and never threatened. RAISON THE GLASS tracked along the inside early but was no
menace.

Footnotes
KARTANO trailed in the four path early, was cued to range up and circled inner rivals from the five path around the far turn, was under a drive while floating
out to the eight path into the stretch, rallied down the center, and was up in the final sixteenth to win. BACKCHAT rated in the two path, waited for room
around the far turn, was coaxed passing the quarter pole and tipped out to the three path entering the lane, and ran on between foes in the final furlong
under right handed urging for place. GOOCH GO BRAGH was a bit rank around the first turn and into the backstretch while racing up close in the three
path, was ridden in the four path around the far turn and in the six path entering the stretch, and kept on for show. DOCTOR RON raced in a stalking
position along the rail, tipped out to the two path and was roused around the far turn, was in the four path entering the lane, and stayed on but was in tight
and steadied nearing the sixteenth pole. TOUGH TO TAME set the pace inside, was coaxed when headed nearing the quarter pole, but yielded passing the
eighth pole. QUITE READY prompted the pace in the two path, bid passing the quarter pole, but gaveway going into the final furlong. WALK UP MUSIC
settled in midpack around the three path early but never threatened. ANOTHER DUKE was fractious in the gate, unhurried along the inside and never a
menace.

between foes at the start, raced off the early pace two wide, made progress three wide around the far turn and faded in the lane. KRYPTON was bumped at
the start, saved ground and failed to menace. GYPSY KITTEN was bumped at the start, stalked the pace two wide in the clear and retreated nearing the

Footnotes
OLYMPIC PRANK set the pace along the inside, was roused from the two path when challenged by an outer foe around the far turn, was cued from the four
path into the lane, opened up under right handed urging into the final furlong, and held sway. SOLO ALBUM stalked in the two path, was driven around the
far turn and under left handed encouragement to the inside of foes entering the stretch, and ran on for place. TIGER TAP tracked in the three path, was
ridden in the four path around the far turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and finished evenly for show. LAKESIDE GETAWAY raced
prominently in the three path early, was cued to bid around the far turn, but flattened in the five path nearing the eighth pole. TAKE IT SOUTH rated along
the inside but was no factor. TAP AND CHU settled off the pace in the four path but never threatened. GYMNAST trailed throughout around the two path.

ONE IDENTITY stalked the pace from the two path, split rivals nearing the eighth pole, vied inside of CHARLIE T and edged ahead under a drive. CHARLIE
T pressed the pace two wide, took the lead while drifting into the four path in upper stretch, led past the eighth pole but was outfinished. MAMBA WAMBA

IMAGERY saved ground in midpack, swung six wide in upper stretch and rallied between foes. STONY POINT chased the pace three wide, angled five
wide in upper stretch and was one-pace in the lane. MOOR STRENGTH failed to menace while racing two wide. WAR OF AGES dueled inside to
midstretch, bled and was vanned off.

Footnotes
THERAPIST brushed with an outer foe at the start and into the first turn, trailed in the five path down the backstretch, ranged up in the six path around the
far turn and bid at the top of the lane, took the lead going into the final furlong, and drew clear under right handed encouragement. EAMONN brushed with
an inner foe leaving the gate and into the first turn, raced off the pace in the five path into the backstretch, moved up going into the far turn and was roused
to bid approaching the quarter pole, was outrun by an outer foe going into the final furlong but kept on to win the photo for place. SPEEDY HANS raced
prominently in the three path, bid passing the quarter pole and took a brief lead in the five path entering the lane, and stayed on but evened out late for
show. BOB MARCO was a bit rank around the first turn and held up in the two path down the backstretch, was ridden between foes approaching the quarter
pole and angled out to the six path turning into the lane, but was no factor. INVISIBLE WAR stalked in the four path, but lost ground around the far turn and
never threatened. IN A SPIN bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked along the inside but faded turning into the stretch. THORN bumped with an outer
foe at the start, recovered to set the pace in the two path, was asked when challenged by a pair of outer foes midway around the far turn, and geaveway
passing the quarter pole.

ARTHUR'S RIDE dueled for the lead in the two path, shifted to the rail around the turn, was coaxed passing the three eighths pole and cued right handed
from the two path at the top of the lane, opened up slightly going into the final furlong and held safe. DREAMLIKE prompted the pace in the five path, was
urged right handed rounding the turn, took aim while floating out to the seven path in upper stretch, and ran on while drifting inwards thru the final furlong for
place. CASE broke out at the start and dueled for the lead in the four path into the turn, was ridden around the turn and urged from the six path into the lane,
but evened out for show. PEREGRINO G rated in the five path but was one paced in the stretch. MONEGASQUE raced off the pace in the three path but
was no factor while shifting to the rail in the stretch. UNION TRAIL stalked in the three path early but faded in the stretch. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT trailed
along the rail into the turn and was never a menace. SECRET THREAT tracked in the four path but never threatened.

YES I AM FREE set a clear pace in the two path and held firm under steady urging. CAROTARI stalked the pace three wide and finished willingly between
rivals. SHEKKY SHEBAZ raced off the pace four wide and ran on to gain the show. BELGRANO steadied when in tight midway down the backstretch, raced
off the pace two wide, swung five wide in upper stretch and had a mild rally. COUNTY FINAL stalked the pace from the rail, had a clear path in the lane but
was one-paced.

Footnotes
SAND DANCER steadied between foes early around the first turn and raced wellback in the three path down the backstretch, was roused approaching the
quarter pole while swinging out to the nine path entering the lane, rallied down the center and drew past an inner foe in the final sixteenth to win. VELOCE
had his head turned at the start but settled close up in the three path, was ridden in the five path around the far turn and took aim from the seven path at the
top of the lane, ran on to bid and take the lead into the final furlong but was caught by a late surging outer foe to finish with place honors. TELEPHONE
TALKER steadied midway around the first turn and was held up in midpack from the four path down the backstretch, was roused in the five path around the
far turn and was under left handed urging in the eight path at the top of the stretch, and kept on for show. KITTEN'S SPA tracked between foes in the three
path, was coaxed rounding the far turn and tipped out to the six path entering the lane, angled out to the center of the track just past the eighth pole, and
finished evenly. PERFECT CUT stalked in the two path, was roused into the far turn and in the three path entering the stretch, but flattened between foes
late. INCITATUS hopped at the start, was keen in the five path while pressing the pacesetter down the backstretch, and faded in the stretch.
THENORTHREMEMBERS steadied midway around the first turn, was behind in the five path down the backstretch, and never threatened. C C'S KITTEN
set the pace inside, was cued passing the quarter pole and in the two path entering the lane, but gaveway in the final furlong. HEAT OF THE NIGHT had to
steady into and out of the the first turn, rated along the inside and was no menace.
