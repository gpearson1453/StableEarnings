Footnotes
LET FREEDOM REIN trailed in the two path, tipped out and moved up in the five path under rousing around the far turn, took aim from the six path entering
the lane, ran on to bid passing the eighth pole, floated in under right handed urging thru the final furlong and bumped with an inner foe twice while dueling
with that foe to the wire, and got the winning bob. GIRLY THE BUTCHER broke out and brushed an outer rival, rated in the three path, was cued to range
up and bid from the five path around the far turn, took over the lead and tipped back in to the three path entering the lane, kept on under left handed urging
while meeting the challenge of an outer foe in the final furlong, bumped with that foe twice in the final sixteenth, and lost the bob to finish with place honors.
RAMADHAAN (IRE) brushed with an inner foe leaving the gate, prompted the pace in the two path, briefly took the lead around the far turn, but was quickly
overtaken by an outer foe, and evened out in the stretch for show. KIT CAN RUN tracked in the two path, was driven around the far turn and angled out to
the five path in upper stretch, but flattened. KAREN'S REVENGE set the pace inside but yielded turning into the stretch. RIA FORMOSA stalked in the three
path but gaveway around the far turn.

PENS STREET dueled in the two path inside of HEIRESSINDY for five furlongs, was confronted on by sides in upper stretch, lightly brushed with YOUR
INHERITANCE in upper stretch, was headed by that foe in midstretch but fought on outside of that foe to prevail. YOUR INHERITANCE stalked the pace
inside, cut the corner into the lane, brushed with the winner in upper stretch, briefly took a short lead in midstretch but was outdueled inside. HEIRESSINDY
dueled outside of the winner in the three path to upper stretch and could not quite keep pace with the top two from there. SIMPLIFY (ARG) had her head
turned at the start and was off several lengths in arrears of the field, chased the pace two wide, tipped four wide in upper stretch and weakened.

THE SLEEPYCHIPMUNK chased in the four path, moved up three wide around the far turn, was driven along while floating out to the seven path into the
lane, bid while angling in entering the final furlong, and drew past late. DUNKLE tracked in the two path, was under urging while tipping out to the five path
going into the stretch, and ran on between foes in the final furlong to get up for place. KYLE'S DEGREE set the pace in the two path, was headed rounding
the far turn, dug in from the two path turning into the lane, but was out run by a pair of outer foes late to show. MEDIA SENSATION trailed in the five path,
was roused into the far turn, swung out to the eight path entering the lane, and chased on. MODAZZLE prompted the pace in the three path, was driven
from the five path into the lane, but faded.

Footnotes
OSKEE WOW WOW brushed with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the four path, bid going into the turn, took command and opened up under rousing in
the two path entering the lane, and was much the best while being kept to task. ACTION DREAM chased in the the two path, was driven from the five path
around the turn and urged right handed into the stretch, and chased home the winner for place. DANLEY trailed from the three path into the turn, swung out
to the six path entering the lane, and finished evenly for show. OUR NOBLE ORTEGA brushed with an inner foe leaving the gate, prompted the pace in the
two path but yielded turning into the lane. ON JET HEIR set the pace inside, lost the lead midway around the turn, and gaveway entering the stretch.

LADY BETH pressed the pace in the three path, took over near the quarter pole and readily drew off under mild urging. TYPEY set the pace in the two path,
was no match for the winner in upper stretch but stayed on willingly inside to hold the place. LE BEAU was in range inside and was one-paced through the
lane to maintain the show. MAKE THE BOYS WINK saved ground off the pace, went two wide around the far turn, tipped three wide in upper stretch and
never threatened. ELYSIAN FIELD failed to menace while racing two and three wide. WILDHAWK was outrun inside. APPEAR played no factor while racing
three and four wide. ALHAAN was in range three wide and retreated after a half.

Footnotes
MAMA STRONG had to steady between rivals early, raced prominently in the two path, was ridden in the three path into the stretch, bid going into the final
furlong, and drew past in the final sixteenth under right handed urging. INQUIETA stalked in the three path into the turn, was driven from the five path into
the stretch, and ran on for place. ANGELIC GAL set the pace while shifting inside going into the turn, was cued entering the lane, dug in in upper stretch but
began to shorten stride in the final sixteenth, and just held show. SINGING THE OLDIES steadied between foes early, tracked inside into the turn, was
roused while tipping out to the three path going into the stretch, and stayed on between rivals but just missed minor rewards. LOVE IS AWESOME raced off
the pace in the five path, floated out to the eight path under urging entering the lane, but was no factor. CHILD MEMORIES trailed along the inside into the
stretch and never threatened. MISS ARIA had to steady along the rail early, shifted out and chased from the four path into the turn but never menaced.

Footnotes
CHARGE IT rated four wide around the first turn, advanced between foes down the backstretch, took over two wide entering the far turn, quickly cleared,
raced in the two path around that bend and through the stretch and held clear under minimal urging. VITTORIO settled off the pace while racing five wide
around the far turn, moved into a clear second three wide around the far turn and finished willingly. CLAPTON bobbled at the break, saved ground off the
pace, advanced between foes around the far turn, angled back to the rail near the quarter pole and rallied for the show. TARTUFO failed to menace while
racing two and three wide. LAUGHING BOY disputed the pace from the rail, could not keep pace with the winner around the far turn and retreated through
the lane. CARMICHAEL had early speed between foes, rated back late on the first turn, chased two wide down the backstretch and faded after a half.
SUPER CURIOSO (ARG) vied three wide around the first turn and faltered nearing the far turn. DUE TO A PHOTO FINISH MALFUNCTION, THE FINAL
MARGINS ARE CHARTCALLER ESTIMATES.

Footnotes
SILVER STRIPES tracked in the three path, ranged up in the five path around the far turn, bid and was coaxed while angling in to the two path entering the
lane, took the lead going into the final furlong, and held on gamely. SOVIET EXCESS set the pace in the two path, opened slightly around the far turn, was
cued right handed along the rail entering the stretch, dug in but lost the lead to an outer foe passing the eighth pole for place. LA GOULU chased inside,
was hustled into the far turn, and finished evenly between foes from the three path in the stretch to show. MORAL TURPITUDE hit the side of the gate and
broke straight outwards, trailed in the two path early, moved up between foes turning into the lane and was under urging in the four path, but was no factor.
SOLICITATION prompted the pace in the three path but flattened along the inside entering the lane. DOMO ARIGATOU rated in the three path but never
threatened from the five path in the stretch. NONNA'S TIRAMISU broke slow, was wellback inside early and failed to menace. LOVE RHAPSODY raced
prominently in the four path but gaveway around the far turn.
