LUNAR MODULE vied for the lead from the three path down the backstretch then took the lead nearing the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch and
held on. CHILI RED tracked the leaders from the inside down the backstretch then moved out to three wide in mid turn for a late effort and just missed.
BUCK'S GLORY was off the pace in the two path but was no match for the top two. MIDNIGHT CROWN shot to the lead to the five sixteenths pole and
tired. STEP ON IT hopped out of the gate then raced near the back down the backstretch made a mild bid on the turn to improve position. TEXAS
ADOPTER was through after a half. MY UNCLE BILLY was restless in the gate, was unhurried down the backstretch but was not a factor.

between calls, pressed the pace on the backstretch from the inside but was empty in the drive. MOSHINYFUTURE stalked the pace from the three path,
made a four wide bid at the five sixteenths pole and flattened out. DREAMED I AM FAST was not a threat. CREEK RAIN broke through the gate before the
start, rushed up to vied for the lead in the three path to the five sixteenths pole and dropped back.

winner. BEAUTIFUL ENDING was forwardly place down the backstretch then made a two wide bid on the final turn to be a clear third. MY SWEET SOPHIA
hustled to a challenged lead to the final turn then vied for the lead into the stretch and gave way grudgingly. EMMAS RULER raced in the middle of the pack
to the final turn then made a two wide bid but failed to menace. L G GIRL stalked the pace from the three path to the five sixteenths pole and gave way.
EAGLEOVERTHEMOON was unhurried around the first turn then moved up on the back stretch and flattened out. WHO DAT GINGER pressed the pace
from the inside around the first turn, stopped and walked off. GLORY TO ME pulled up and was vanned off. STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE EARLY
