Footnotes
STARSHIP LEGEND stalked in the four path, was roused around the far turn and bid from the four path entering the lane, lugged in just before the eighth
pole, was corrected and ran on to lead going into the final furlong, began to drift out late, but held on to win. SING SCAT broke out at the start, rated in the
four path, ranged up around the far turn and swung out to the seven path entering the stretch, and ran on for place. ANCIENT RELIC jumped out of the gate
and was wellback in the three path early, was ridden around the far turn and fanned out to the eight path entering the lane, and kept on down the center for
show. GRATIA broke in and bumped between foes leaving the gate, was unhurried in the four path around the first turn and shifted to the rail down the
backstretch, was coaxed around the far turn and in the six path entering the stretch, and stayed on late. MORGAN'S BLUFF brushed with an outer foe at
the start, was held up in midpack from the three path, was under right handed urging in the two path turning into the lane was short of room and angled out
to the four path passing the eighth pole, and finished evenly. AMERICAN ODALISQUE set the pace in the two path, was roused when headed along the rail
around the far turn, but yielded going into the final furlong. LIPARI was reserved in the five path early, was ridden in the seven path turning into the lane, but
was no factor. BREAKING BULLET brushed with an inner foe at the start, raced prominently in the three path, was cued to bid going into the far turn, briefly
lead turning into the stretch, but was in tight passing the eighth pole, and faded. UPSTREET checked going into the first turn, tracked in the two path, was
ridden around the far turn, but gaveway entering the lane.

Footnotes
EXPRESSMAN brushed with an outer foe just after start, set the pace in the two path, was coaxed along the inside passing the quarter pole and urged left
handed while losing the lead to an outer foe in upper stretch, dueled with that foe and dug in gamely along the rail into the final furlong, and got up inside the
final sixteenth to win. MONTAUK POINT prompted the pacesetter along the inside around the first turn, shifted to the three path down the backstretch, was
roused around the far turn and bid in the two path entering the lane, ran on to take the lead into the final furlong, dueled with the inner pacesetter to the wire
under right handed urging, and got out-finished late to end with place honors. THE SKIPPER TOO brushed with an inner foe after the start, tracked in the
four path, was cued right handed in the three path around the far turn, and kept on for show. ICONIC ADVENTURE stalked in the two path, was coaxed
along the inside around the far turn, but weakened in the four path in the stretch. SOUTH POINTE DRIVE raced wellback in the six path, was driven in the
three path around the far turn, but was no menace from the seven path in the stretch. CHROME REPUBLIC trailed throughout, was eased into the stretch,
pulled up just past the eighth pole, and walked off.

Footnotes
RETIRED settled off the pace along the inside for six furlongs, swung five wide in upper stretch, closed outside and was up in deep stretch. DITHER set a
rated pace along the rail, kicked clear when roused in upper stretch but could not quite hold off the winner. MY FAVORITE TOPIC raced in range two wide,
angled four wide in upper stretch and had a mild rally to gain the show. O GANGSTER saved ground up close and never quite had a clear path in the lane.
DONTONIO broke a bit awkwardly, trailed in the two path, swung widest in upper stretch and improved position. VICTORY LINE hopped at the start, was
keyed up, advanced three wide around the first turn, bid three wide around the far turn, reached near even terms near the quarter pole but tired in the drive.
LIEUTENANT STAN pressed the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane.

URANIUM bumped an inner foe into another inner foe at the start, raced prominently in the four path, was roused around the turn and took aim from the
seven path entering the lane, bid passing the eighth pole and drew past an inner foe in the final sixteenth to win. ELEKTRONIC prompted the pace in the
three path, bid from the six path entering the stretch, ran on and briefly led just past the eighth pole, but was caught by an outer foe to place. BARONE
CESCO got bumped around between foes leaving the gate, chased in the four path, was coaxed around the turn and swung out to the eight path into the
stretch, floated inwards under right handed urging, and kept on for show. PSYCHEDELIC SHACK set the pace in the two path, floated out around the turn
and was roused from the five path into the stretch, but yielded in the final furlong. DISCREET TUNE stalked along the inside, was driven from the four path
into the lane, but was one paced. BEE BY THE SEA was held up in midpack between rivals in the three path going into the turn, was ridden in the five path
into the lane, but flattened. GAME BOY BENNY brushed with an outer foe just after the start, trailed in the three path into the turn, and was no factor in the
stretch. GINS AND TINS bumped with an outer foe at the start, had to steady, and then brushed with an inner foe just after, raced off the pace inside but
was no menace.

Footnotes
TALKIN TIPSY brushed with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the two path, tipped out and was cued right handed around the turn, ranged up from the
seven path into the stretch, bid and took the lead passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. MOANAS POWER dueled for the lead in the three path, took the
lead and was in the four path entering the lane, and kept on but was caught at the eighth pole by an outer foe to finish in place. GOLDEN ISLE dueled for
the lead while shifting inside into the turn, was roused from the two path passing the quarter pole, but yielded to a pair of outer foes approaching the eighth
pole to show. SOL HOPE chased in the three path into the turn but was one paced from the five path in the stretch. CHASING JOY stalked in the two path,
was driven from the rail around the turn, but flattened in the four path down the lane. DAVID'S ROSE brushed with an outer foe leaving the gate, raced off
the pace along the inside but never threatened from the two path in the stretch. SHEZA SPITFIRE was in tight between foes leaving the gate and had to
steady just after, and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SOUPER DORMY settled off the pace while racing two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, moved to the front near the sixteenth pole and edged
ahead. GRAY'S FABLE saved ground off the pace, waited for room in upper stretch, got through inside of the pacesetter in midstretch and finished willingly.
CREED had his head turned at the start, raced off the pace two wide, angled out in upper stretch and rallied for the show. FIRST EMPIRE set the pace
along the rail, drifted slightly nearing the eighth pole, led to the sixteenth pole and weakened. VALUE PROPOSITION (GB) raced two and three wide in
midpack and lacked the needed rally. CANDY TYCOON pressed the pace two wide for a half, dueled two wide around the far turn and through midstretch
then faded. CALL ME HARRY veered out at the start and bumped SEVEN CHANNELS soon after, chased the pace three wide, bid three wide nearing the
quarter pole but had little left for the drive. HOT BLOODED was in range inside and lacked a closing bid. SEVEN CHANNELS was bumped at the start,
raced three wide and never threatened. SKY'S NOT FALLING was fractious in the gate, unprepared for the start, left in a tangle and well behind the field,
raced three wide around the first turn, made a five wide middle move and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
CRUZIN MAN set the pace in the two path, shifted to the rail around the turn, was roused passing the quarter pole and back in the two path entering the
lane, dug in under right handed urging passing the eighth pole, and held gamely while brushing with an outer foe late to win. ORGANIZEDCONFUSION
bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked along the inside, was ridden around the turn and angled out to the four path into the stretch, ran on while
drifting out into the final furlong, drifted back in and bumped with the eventual winner to his inside late, and lost the photo to place. MR. RHODIUM bumped
with an outer foe leaving the gate, chased in the two path, was driven from the three path into the stretch, angled in to the rail passing the eighth pole, and
kept on for show. MR. AMERICAN bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the four path, was cued right handed turning into the lane, and stayed on
but lost the photo for minor rewards. SIR GOOSA bumped with an outer foe leaving the gate, rated in the four path, was under left handed urging while
floating out to the six path into the stretch, but was no factor. IMPOSTER SYNDROME prompted the pace in the three path but was empty turning into the
lane. REDISUR was bumped between rivals at the start and trailed throughout around the five to two paths.
