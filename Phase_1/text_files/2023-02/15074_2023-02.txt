Footnotes
LOOKOUT POINT rated off of the decent early pace, saved ground to the far turn, rallied four wide into the stretch run, dodged AFRICAN PRINCE when
that one swerved in mid-stretch, closed fast inside of the furlong marker, came within aim in deep stretch and caught TIGER'S ARROW in the final strides to
prevail. TIGER'S ARROW prominent into the first turn, attended to the decent fractions through the backstretch run, pressured then overtook RANCHO RED
nearing the top of the lane, drew to a clear lead in mid-stretch, remained clear to the sixteenth-marker, was caught by the winner in the final strides and held
safely for second. SHANAGOLDEN bobbled at the start, took back off of the loose leaders through the backstretch run, roused leaving the three-furlong
marker, raced three wide into the drive, was outkicked in deep stretch and was clear for third. AFRICAN PRINCE raced closest to the loose leading pair
through decent early fractions, advanced leaving the second turn, ran evenly in the final furlong, was a bit erratic in the late stages and could not impact the
top three in the end. KID STOLE A KISS took back off of the decent early pace, saved ground to the top of the lane and did not threaten. RANCHO RED
sent to establish the early advantage, set prompted fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure from TIGER'S ARROW nearing the quarter
marker, was overtaken by that rival leaving the far turn and faded in the drive. TAKE THE TWO TEN allowed to settle, lagged through the backstretch run,
asked for run nearing the top of the lane and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
MISTICAL SURPRISE away in good order, contested the early pace with DADDYS NINA, lost ground to that rival nearing the top of the lane, chased to
mid-stretch, responded to firm urging inside of the furlong marker, re-rallied and took command inside of the sixteenth-marker and determinedly held on in
the final strides to prevail. DIZZY DAZMURA broke in at the start and was away a step slowly, chased the moderate early pace, raced three wide on the
turn, swung five wide for the drive, made a steady gain through the final furlong, came within aim of MISTICAL SURPRISE in deep stretch and just missed
for the win in the final strides, while besting the rest. GOLD RUSH GAL allowed to settle while outside of rivals in the early going, roused five wide into the
stretch run, was not able to impact the top two in the late stages but closed well and was up for show in the final strides. LADY BLACKBIRD forwardly
placed in the early stages, chased the moderate pace while three wide to the quarter marker, advanced to vie for the lead in mid-stretch, could not keep
pace in the late stages, weakened in deep stretch and was just edged for third. PETE'S INFERNO hit the gate leaving the start then was shuffled back in the
first few strides and was away slowly, took back off of the decent early pace, raced two wide on the turn, angled four wide in upper stretch, encountered
traffic inside of the furlong marker, remained blocked to the sixteenth-pole and finished evenly in the late stages. DADDYS NINA engaged with MISTICAL
SURPRISE in the early stages and disputed the moderate early pace, dueled outside of that rival on the turn, took a narrow advantage into upper stretch,
battled to the furlong marker and gave way in the late stages. BIG STORM KITTY chased the moderate early pace, lost ground while two wide on the turn
and did not offer a late rally.

Footnotes
LIGHT UP away in good order, took back off of the modest early pace, well placed through the backstretch run, roused three wide nearing the quarter
marker, assumed command leaving the far turn, extended the lead to mid-stretch, drew clear nearing the sixteenth-marker, Rivera lost his crop inside of the
sixteenth-marker, kept to task in deep stretch and lasted over the quickly oncoming runner-up. SHANGHAI MIST allowed to settle, a bit keen along the first
turn, settled along the backstretch run, trailed to the far turn, came in tight nearing the top of the lane and encountered traffic in upper stretch, shifted out
and found racing room in mid-stretch, closed with a rush in the final stages and just missed for the win while securing the place in the final strides.
MOONSHINE CAT rated off of the pace while traveling in the second flight, advanced three wide on the far turn, lost ground in upper stretch, re-rallied in the
final furlong, finished well and just missed for place, while securing show in the final strides. ARISTEIA assumed command leaving the break, set modest
fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken by LIGHT UP leaving the far turn, stayed within aim
while chasing that rival to mid-stretch, was outfinished in the late stages and was just edged for third. FLIPLIT forwardly placed in the early going, stalked
the modest fractions from the rail to the second turn, lost ground nearing the furlong pole, was gaining in deep stretch but could not match strides with the
leaders in the final stages. COCOA CENTS prominent into the first turn, raced close to the modest early pace, advanced to attend to the pace to the second
turn, lost position in upper stretch, showed good late interest but did not offer the needed late response. SMILING MELANIE allowed to settle while not far
back, raced outside of rivals to the second turn, came four wide to the quarter marker and lacked a late rally.

Footnotes
EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER asked to show early speed and was sent to dictate terms early on, was confronted by ON RAGLAN ROAD along the backstretch
run, was headed by that rival nearing the top of the lane, battled to mid-stretch, lost the lead inside of the furlong marker, fought back from the inside while
dueling to the wire in deep stretch and determinedly prevailed in the final strides. ON RAGLAN ROAD prominent into the first turn, stalked the early pace
then advanced to press the decent fractions to the second turn, came to even terms with EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER nearing the quarter marker, battled to
mid-stretch and took a narrow lead inside of the furlong pole, dueled to the outside of EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER to deep stretch and was gamely bested in the
final strides, while well clear of the rest for second. ECOLOGIST took back to race in the second flight, well placed to the far turn, roused three wide into the
stretch run, was not able to impact the top two in the late stages but rallied in deep stretch and outfinished WILL IS CHILL to secure third. WILL IS CHILL
broke out at the start and crowded AWE, was allowed to settle, roused leaving the three-furlong marker, saved ground to the top of the lane, closed willingly
in the late stages and just missed for third in the final strides. AWE crowded at the start and was away a step slowly, was allowed to settle in the early going,
advanced along the backstretch run, well placed into the second turn, chased the top pair into the stretch and lacked a late rally. BROKEN FINGER came in
a bit tight into the first turn,stalked the decent early fractions, saved ground to the quarter marker and tired in the drive. ORCZY (IRE) unhurried in the early
stages, lost contact along the second turn and was not a factor.

EXCESSIVE CAT bobbled slightly at the start but showed good early speed and dictated terms to the turn, was pressed by PHANTOM DROP to the quarter
marker, shook free of that rival leaving the turn, drew clear to mid-stretch and drew away under mild urging in the final sixteenth. PHANTOM DROP broke
sharply then lost the early lead to EXCESSIVE CAT, tracked that rival to the turn, pressed the solid pace to the quarter marker, could not keep pace with the
winner in the drive and held for second in the late stages. CONTINENTAL UNION allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground on the turn, roused in
upper stretch, found his best stride late, closed well in the final sixteenth and just missed for second, while clear of the rest for third. MUAY THAI (IRE)
chased from the second flight in the early going, raced two wide between runners to the quarter marker, encountered traffic in upper stretch, raced on the
left lead in the drive and lacked a late response. TIZ VICIOUS chased the fast early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, was outrun in upper stretch and
lacked a late rally. EMERALD MAGIC was unhurried in the early stages, chased three wide on the turn and did not threaten in the late stages. R M C
HOOK'EM was forwardly placed in the early going, steadied off of heels nearing the half-mile marker, stalked the fast pace from the rail on the turn and tired
in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
LA VIKINA prominent in the early stages, stalked the decent fractions to the half-mile marker, roused two wide nearing the quarter pole, overtook SEN SEN
leaving the far turn, extended the lead to mid-stretch and kept to task in the late stages to prove best. SCHERZO (GB) forwardly placed into the first turn,
tracked the decent pace from a ground saving position through the backstretch run, angled three wide approaching the top of the lane, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, was outkicked by the winner in the final stages and held well in the end to secure the place. GETTIN SIDEWAYS took back in the early going,
advanced along the backstretch run and was well positioned into the far turn, raced two then three wide nearing the quarter marker, caught a bit of traffic
turning into the stretch and angled back inside for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was outfinished for place, while holding safely for show.
IMPERIAL CREED allowed to settle, raced outside of rivals while advancing on the backstretch run, mounted a four wide bid nearing the top of the stretch,
ran evenly to the furlong grounds and flattened out in the late stages. SEN SEN a bit fractious in the gate, was hustled to establish the early lead, dictated
terms while carving out decent fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, was collared by LA VIKINA leaving
the second turn and gave way in the drive. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU never far back in the early running, could not keep pace on the second turn and tired in the
stretch.

Footnotes
MOMO'S KIDDO shied from SGT POWELL when that one came in at the break, kept to the rear of the field under some light restraint, moved up into
contention on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, found clear run and launched a bold rally down the middle of the course to get up just in time over a
game opponent. MURLOC BAY was first away from the break, opened up a clear lead through the turn with a host of challengers in close pursuit, opened
up in the stretch and ran on well only to be caught in the final yards. FLY WICKED EAGLE fractious in the gate, got a good break and was among the
leaders early, then lost a bit of ground on the turn, came under a hard ride from the quarter pole then found a second wind, finishing well to gain third. DR
LOW KEY was off-balance at the break then ducked in and was bumped in turn by FLY WICKED EAGLE to the inside then by MURLOC BAY to the
outside, steadied, then rushed up to join the pace, came under heavy pressure passing the quarter pole, ran on the wrong lead through most of the stretch
and flattened out. LOKI OF ASGARD broke alertly but outrun in the early stages, came under a ride with three furlongs to go, swung five wide for the stretch
run and finished with some interest but was unable to improve position. SGT POWELL broke in at the start and quickly corrected, was not asked for much
speed early and settled in a tracking position behind the early pace, was in striking position through the turn but boxed in, got clear at the head of stretch
then was bumped by FLY WICKED EAGLE then unable to find a good rhythm after that and lacked a rally. GATO NEGRO broke a bit slowly, saved ground
throughout and finished evenly while never a threat. BOLD TALKER broke well and was among the leaders down the backstretch, loomed a threat to the top
of the stretch but then tired and had little to offer down the stretch.
