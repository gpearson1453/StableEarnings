Footnotes
SHE SO COOL rounded the first turn four wide and settled off the pace from the seven eighths pole, closed toward contention three wide into the
backstretch, took the lead approaching the seven sixteenths pole and raced clear past the pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and was kept alert through
the lane. SOMEBODY LOVES ME saved ground then eased out with a bid into the backstretch, rounded the far turn at the rail, drifted into the lane and
settled for second best. MANGORITA settled in the three path early, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and came along
for third in later yards. WHY LEA took the lead at the rail approaching the seven eighths pole and rated the pace, was met into the backstretch, gave chase
from that point but dropped back toward the three eighths pole and flattened stride while losing ground on the far turn. REGGAETONI steadied early and
saved ground, eased outward through the second turn, left the turn outside and showed little response. KOKOLORES settled off the rail and showed little
response. RIGHT TO ASSEMBLE stalked from the two and three paths, drew to even terms into the backstretch but faded past the seven sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
MANHATTAN WEAVE stumbled at the break but took a quick lead and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, raced near the rail on
the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. STRINGFELLA rounded the first turn about the four path and left the turn outside, bid leaving the three
eighths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn, dueled for second mid-stretch and finished evenly. JOHNNY SWISH was pinched back early, moved to
the inside then shut off at the heels of D Tachyon midway on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and dug in
through the stretch to hold onto third. LET'S GET PHYSICAL raced well off the early pace two deep then eased out and gave chase into the backstretch,
rounded the far turn about the five path, dug in from the head of the lane and got up for third at the wire. A FAREWELL YODEL saved ground racing well
back, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. DAKOTA BOY chased the early
pace inside then stalked into the first turn, resumed the chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened off the rail on the far turn. D TACHYON came in
and rounded the first turn about the three path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn. OBANNON came in
early then steadied between horses past the five eighths pole and never factored.

Footnotes
CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE settled off the pace about the five path, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead two deep past the
quarter pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. CAIRO BOOGIE raced well back from early contention, bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, raced two deep on the far turn and cleared second mid-stretch. LIL TOUGHMAN raced with the early pace two deep and took the
nod at the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure nearing the three eighths, but was met past the quarter and weakened leaving the far turn. PLUNK
stalked the earlier pace from the three and four paths, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then
flattened in the lane. MASTER THIS raced off the pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on
the far turn and showed little in the lane. STAVANGER saved ground racing well back, eased out and gave chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn
about the six path and weakened in the lane. CITIZEN'S FIRE set the early pace inside, was met and gave chase from the nine sixteenths pole, but dropped
back approaching the three eighths and faded into the far turn. FRONT PORCH saved ground, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened
in the five path of the far turn. CHAMPAGNE JAM loped along and was eased the final quarter mile.

SPEAK YOUR MIND gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, drifted leaving the turn but dug in under steady
encouragement to get up the final strides. COLLEGE KID set a pressured pace and contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, dug in under steady
handling leaving the turn but was caught in the final strides and just lasted for second. PRAY FOR THE U S A chased toward the outside, rounded the turn
about the four path, angled to the outside leaving the turn, finished well to take third the final yards and just missed second. REIGN ON AND ON chased
through the backstretch and contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, but dropped back past the eighth pole and flattened stride late. LADY
STORM pressured the pace through the backstretch, but was bumped by Little Bit Of That approaching the quarter pole, rounded the turn near the rail and
ran evenly in the lane. CANVAS ART engaged in close early chase but steadied between horses near the three eighths pole, resumed her drive toward the
five sixteenths, raced near the rail on the turn, eased out into the lane and showed little more. LITTLE BIT OF THAT pressured the pace inside but was
steadied in tight at the rail and bumped Lady Storm approaching the quarter pole, then faded through the turn. SIZZLING HOT was never a factor. GOT
YOUR NUMBER gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path, eased out leaving the turn and showed little in the lane. The Stewards reviewed, then
dismissed, a claim of foul against the rider of College Kid for alleged interference nearing the quarter pole, lodged by the rider of Lady Storm.

Footnotes
TAPIT TO THE WIRE stalked off the rail on the first turn, pulled himself to the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole and was urged clear toward the three
eighths, widened at the rail on the far turn then steadily handled through the lane. ITS OVER settled in the two and three paths the first turn then eased out
into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced two deep on the far turn and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride.
SULEMAN saved ground well off the pace, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and finished evenly to take third
under the wire. BOOK OF DELANCEY rounded the first turn in the three path, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path
of the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. GOT FLOFFY rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn at the rail but flattened inside the eighth pole. URBAN WARRIOR stalked the pace inside on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole
but faded past the five sixteenths. LUNAR IMAGE raced well off the pace about the three path on the opening turn, showed little response through the
backstretch and ran in the three path of the far turn. PROUD UNION was shuffled back shortly after the start and was not a factor. CAPTAIN CARDO took
the lead at the three quarter pole and rated a short lead, but was caught at the seven sixteenths pole and faded toward the far turn. RUNNING VIOLENCE
stalked the early pace from the four path, gave chase into the backstretch but faded past the three eighths pole.
