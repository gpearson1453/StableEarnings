Footnotes
ORBITING THE SKY with the second flight three wide into the stretch, surged late under strong handling and got up in the final strides. GALILEO'S AFFAIR
unhurried, closed willingly four wide through deep stretch and just missed getting up in time. SUPER DONNA G pressed the pace two wide around the
clubhouse turn, made the lead before a half, shook clear on the far turn, set the balance of the pace and was caught in the final stages. NO SNIVELING
close up along the rail, shifted out a bit near the half mile pole, dug in two wide through the stretch then was outfinished despite a determined effort.
PRANCIPANTS was a forward factor from the start, offered a strong bid along the rail in deep stretch then was outkicked in the final strides. FLECK was no
factor. KEYPIT set the early pace along the inside under pressure, had speed into the far turn then was used up.

SHE MAKES ME TIZZY lead briefly a few strides out of the gate, gave up the advantage to SABELLE soon thereafter, chased that one into the stretch, dug
in late three wide and was along in time. SABELLE sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set all the pace then couldn't handle the winner in the final
stages. TARA DAWN stalked the pace into the stretch and finished determinedly along the rail. GRAN MAMIBELLA unhurried early, swung wide then
closed with a burst of speed in the six path. ANDIAMA trailed early, improved position on the turn then closed some ground late in the five path. WILLYMAR
had speed through the turn then wilted.

Footnotes
FOREST SELECTION pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, gained a slight advantage and proved best by a narrow margin following a stretch long
dive. EL ROSILLO vied for the lead three wide, drew on near even terms for the lead nearing the top of the stretch, matched strides the balance of the trip
and finished second best. VAMONOS with the second flight inside, swung wide and closed ground late in the six path. CHIEF MYSTIQUE raced wide early,
angled in three wide on the turn then passed tiring rivals. BUILT LIKE TARZAN failed to menace. PERFECT SPLIT sprinted to the lead soon after the start,
set a pressured pace into the stretch then weakened. ROGERS GINGER pressed the pace three wide into the turn, steadied between rivals and lost
momentum. COPPER HARBOR was outrun. HEARNS had brief speed.

Footnotes
AWESOMELY SHY stalked the pace into the turn, responded readily when set down three wide, made the lead in upper stretch and drew off under right
handed urging. YEARS AGO sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace along the inside into the stretch then was no match for winner.
LOVELY LISA pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then was outfinished. RACEDAY ATTIRE inside early, drifted to the four path entering the stretch
then went evenly. BOURBONWITHGINGER stalked the pace from the five path into the stretch then failed to respond. GRAY ROYALITY failed to menace.
PURDY PUMKIN was no threat. BLANQUITA NIEVE was no factor. CALTHA had brief speed. SKY was no threat. MY GLORY trailed throughout, stopped
in the stretch, was eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
BRONZE KETTLE was in tight at the start, shifted outside soon thereafter, closed with a burst of speed three wide through the stretch and got up in the final
strides. PROSECUTOR pressed the pace two wide, took command entering the turn, shook clear along the inside into the stretch then couldn't handle the
late charge of the winner. INDY CARR broke inward, raced well back early then found his best stride late four wide. FLAG RAISER never far back, offered a
mild bid two wide into the stretch then was outfinished. PEDAL TO DA KETTLE trailed early then passed tiring rivals. IPPOLITO'S WONDER stalked the
early pace and was through after a half. GHOSTLY REVIVAL was no threat. WHY KENNY WHY was no factor. OHIO RIVER away alertly, set the early
pace under pressure, had speed into the stretch, stopped abruptly, was pulled up before the wire and was walked off. PER HISA RULING ID:P000019364
DATED 02/16/2023, BRONZE KETTLE WAS DQ'D DUE TO A WHIP INFRACTION.
