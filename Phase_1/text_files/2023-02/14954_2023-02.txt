MASETA tracked three wide while just off leaders, battled on wrong lead past quarter pole, stretch, dug in and gamely prevailed on the wire.
AUTHORITARIAN sped to the front from inside, stayed game to deep stretch but nailed on the wire. ELI inside run to far turn, angled out into the stretch but
leveled off in the stretch run for show spot. ZERO TO ONEHUNDRED raced along evenly while widest quarter pole, no late kick. DENY never factored
throughout. ENGLISH CLASSIC chased pace to the half, gave way into the stretch run. KICK IT CHARLIE antsy in gate, outbroke rider, rushed, never a real
threat. SONIC BURN never menaced throughout.
