Footnotes
LOVE APPEALS stalked along the inside, waited for room around the far turn and floated out to the three path at the top of the lane, was coaxed while
quickly shifting back to the rail before the eighth pole, bid for the lead passing the eighth pole, and outkicked an outer rival to win. DELAHAYE rated in the
three path, was ridden in the four path around the far turn and took aim in the five path entering the lane, ran on while angling in to the three path and bid
passing the eighth pole, but lost the whip approaching the final sixteenth and was outfinished by an inner rival to place. HOLY FOLEY raced off the pace in
the three path, was roused in the four path rounding the far turn and was cued left handed in the six path entering the stretch. and kept on for show.
PENUMBRAS MAKER set the pace along the inside was coaxed nearing the quarter pole and cued right handed in the two path at the top of the lane, but
yielded between foes just before the sixteenth pole. KENTUCKY KISS was unhurried along the inside, was roused around the far turn and angled out to the
seven path into the lane, but was no factor. LA MAZEL settled in midpack around the two path early but never threatened. READY SHE IS prompted the
early pace in the two path but faded from the four path in the stretch.

Footnotes
MR. CELLULAR pressed the pacesetter in the two path into the turn, took a narrow lead approaching the quarter pole and was cued right handed in the four
path entering the lane, and drew away from the inner pace setter in the final furlong to secure the win. MAKIN BANK set the pace along the inside, was
under a ride around the turn and headed before the quarter pole, lost the lead to an outer foe while in the three path turning into the stretch, kept on under
left handed urging into the final furlong, but yielded nearing the final sixteenth to place. LAST DREAM was prompted along in the three path, driven around
the turn and urged from the five path into the stretch, and was one paced for show. TACTICAL FORCE stumbled badly leaving the gate nearly losing the
rider who lost his right iron but quickly regained it in the opening furlong, chased while shifting inwards into the turn, was ridden along the rail around the
turn, but flattened in the stretch. EL MIC TIESUN brushed with an outer foe at the start, trailed from the four path into the turn and never threatened.
FROSTY WARRIOR brushed with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the four path but was done after a half. NO CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER AN
INQUIRY WAS HELD TO ENSURE TACTICAL FORCE HAD A FAIR START.

Footnotes
DREAMING OF AUDREY settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled four wide near the eighth pole, closed outside and was up in deep stretch. SIX
FEET APART set the pace in the two path, dug in inside of OPEONGO when that foe reached even terms near the sixteenth pole, never that one by but
was unable to stave off the winner in the final strides. OPEONGO prompted the pace in the three path, was late to switch leads, reached near even terms
near the sixteenth pole but was outfinished between the top two finishers. FEDALIA saved ground off the pace, steadily angled out through the lane to the
reach the six path late and rallied belatedly. CHECK THE GRADE tracked the pace from the rail and weakened in the lane. SHE'S CLASSY bumped with
QUEEN CALYPSO at the start, raced in range three wide but had no rally. QUEEN CALYPSO was bumped at the start, raced four wide and never
threatened.

Footnotes
GRACE DARLING (IRE) was unhurried in the two path early, moved up between rivals into the far turn, was coaxed in the two path passing the quarter pole
and was gaining going into the stretch, surged between rivals to take the lead passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. IDLE CHATTER had a slow start,
trailed around the first turn and was in the five path down the backstretch, was cued while shifting in to the two path around the far turn and urged left
handed in the three path into the lane, and ran on for place. GALILEO'S JEWEL (IRE) broke out at the start and was out in the five path around the first turn,
raced prominently in the three path down the backstretch, was given a right handed cue in the four path turning into the stretch, and kept on but drifted out in
the final furlong for show. ACCEPT THE OUTCOME (IRE) was a bit keen early and was steadied to the inside of foes around the first turn, stalked in the
two path, was roused nearing the quarter pole and angled out to the six path at the top of the lane, but finished evenly. KAYLEIGH'S PRIDE rated in the
three path, was coaxed in the four path around the far turn, but was no factor in the five path thru the stretch. QUEEN ROCKET was sent to set the pace
along the inside, opened slightly under rousing turning into the lane, but gaveway going into the final furlong. SEVEN P'S was held up off the pace inside of
rivals, was steadied slightly going into the far turn, and never threatened. MELINOE settled in range in the four path, but folded between foes turning into the
lane.

Footnotes
C MY MEISTER stalked the pace inside around the first turn, advanced four wide around the far turn, seized command near the quarter pole, burst clear
soon, after, angled into the two path in upper stretch and widened under left-handed urging. BADBADBOBBY prompted the pace in the three path, bid
between foes nearing the quarter pole, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch but kept trying and was clearly second best. BOARD
CERTIFIED raced in range two and three wide, lacked the needed rally but was along for the show. GARMENTO set the pace in the two path and gave way
near the quarter pole. ALEXIS N NIKO was bumped and pinched back at the start, saved ground well back, went four wide around most of the far turn,
angled to the rail in upper stretch and never threatened. TAPIT BRIO was bumped at the start, saved ground and failed to menace.

Footnotes
HERINGTON ROCKET tracked in the four path, was roused into the far turn and ranged up to bid passing the quarter pole, took the lead while still in the
four path into the stretch, opened slightly passing the eighth pole, and held clear under right handed urging. BIG BEE broke out and brushed an outer foe,
was unhurried along the inside, was ridden in the two path passing the quarter pole and angled out to the five path at the top of the lane, ran on but lugged
in after a right handed cue passing the eighth pole, was corrected, and chased home the winner for place. ZISISIT (IRE) bumped with an inner foe at the
start, stalked along the inside, was coaxed into the far turn and bid from the rail approaching the quarter pole, but was outkicked by an outer foe entering the
stretch, and evened out passing the eighth pole for show. ECONOMIC HANGOVER got bumped between foes leaving the gate, rated in the three path, was
driven around the far turn and swung out to the six path into the stretch, but finished evenly. TAPPLE CIDER was bumped between foes leaving the gate
and trailed in the two path into the far turn, fanned out to the nine path turning into the lane, and was no factor. MINT EDITION was held up while up close in
the four path but gaveway turning into the lane. MUSICAL ROMANCE (GB) set the pace in the two path but yielded between rivals near the quarter pole.

Footnotes
TURF KING (IRE) stalked in the two path, was roused along the rail around the far turn and tipped out to the four path entering the lane, bid while merging
into the two path under left handed urging into the final furlong and edged past the inner pacesetter in the final strides to win. NATE THE GREAT set the
pace in the the two path, was cued right handed going into the stretch, shifted to the rail while digging in the final furlong, but was caught by an outer foe late
to place. CLEVER THOUGHT rated in the three path, was roused in the five path around the far turn and floated out to the nine path into the lane, and ran
on while drifting in under left handed encouragement for show. FEARLESS SOLDIER threw his head and hopped at the start, raced prominently in the four
path, was cued right handed around the far turn, brushed with an inner foe entering the stretch and was out in the seven path, and evened out while lugging
in through the final furlong. STANLEY HOUSE chased in the three path, was under right handed urging around the far turn and was in the five path at the
top of the lane, lugged in nearing the eighth pole, was corrected back to the five path, but was no factor. JUSTIN'S LEGACY prompted the pace in the three
path, was driven around the far turn and brushed with an outer foe into the stretch, drifted in passing the eighth pole, and flattened. ORDINARY raced off the
pace along the inside and never menaced. CARMIE'S ARMY trailed throughout around the three path.
