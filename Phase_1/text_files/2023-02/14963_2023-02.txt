NUMMY NUM Broke in stride and sat off leader's hip two wide into the first turn, joined lead when sandwiched between gaining outside rival and standing
inner leader at half mile pole, ran in between three astride until three-sixteenths pole, made narrow lead at eighth pole, won two horse battle down lane.
BELLA VINO Asserted self on the lead and held the rail from outset, joined by gaining pair outside at half mile pole and fought along until three-sixteenths
pole, nudged outside rival at top of lane, dueled valiantly to line but was narrowly outfinished. THIRSTY COWBOY Away in slow order, quickly rushed up
three wide after two outside rivals cleared to inside, moved up further to join leaders three in a line at half-mile pole, attempted to threaten at three
sixteenths pole, flattened out into lane. AN OBJECTION WAS LODGED BY THE RIDER OF #3 BELLA VINO AGAINST #5 NUMMY NUM FOR
POTENTIAL INTERFERENCE THROUGHOUT THE RUNNING OF THE RACE. THE CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.
