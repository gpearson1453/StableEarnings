Footnotes
IRONIT was sent from the one post position, secured the inside trip, set the pace, lead all the way around the turn, was asked at the quarter pole and drew
off. Much the best today. PAT HAND GIRL settled far off the pace early in the three path, gained ground after the half, circled around in the turn, was five
wide in lane and closed gaining ground bit by bit and out finished the rest. SUNSHINE STAR settled just off the leaders hip, was in a set of three for the first
half of the race, shook one of those competitors after the half, had sights on the leaders at the quarter, launched a drive and was caught late but was up for
third. THE MISSING PIECE broke out at the start causing an outside foe to break out as well, was corrected, raced mid pack but never fired.
FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS was pushed out at the start by the horse to her inside, was given time to find her stride, chased from the back, swung wide at the
quarter but had no impact. WENDY WILECAT vied for the early lead from the seven path, settled in the second tier from the outside, angled towards the rail
at the quarter pole and stopped in the lane. RESPOSADO sent in between horses in the second tier, was in contention at the three eighths pole, was shifted
out of traffic before the quarter mile pole and was eased in the lane. RESPOSADO DID WALK OFF.

Footnotes
BERNIECE broke in and bumped a rival at the start, stalked behind the top pair while a bit off of the rail around the turn, bid for the lead inside of them in
upper stretch, and drove clear at the furlong grounds. RUN DREAMING bumped inner rival at the start, dueled for the lead inside of a foe while in the two
path, but was outkicked by a rail bidder approaching midstretch, flopped back to his left lead in the final furlong, and lasted for place from an inner rival.
BITSY PERFECTMATCH lacked speed along the inside, but was keen inside of rivals leaving the half mile pole, steadied into the turn, took the bend in the
three path, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, and rallied through the final furlong, but failed to catch an outer rival for place. PERIPHERAL VISION
pursued from midpack two wide early on, chased along the inside around the turn, and kept on evenly. DIVINE DEFENCE was bumped an bothered by an
outer rival at the start, dueled for the lead outside of a rival while in the three path, but gave way nearing midstretch. SWEET LITTLE ROSE was fractious in
the gates, broke a step slow, trailed in the four path around the turn, shifted out in upper stretch, and lacked a rally. CUSTOMIZED TWIN hopped slightly
before being bumped and bothered by an outer rival at the start, tracked four wide, and gave way in the six path through the lane.

Footnotes
JACKIE FLASH vied for the early lead, settled in hands along the rail just off the leader, patiently waited around the turn while being pressured slightly with
horses on her outside, she was able to get clear at the quarter pole and went on for the win. CORONA DEL MAR vied for the lead, took the rail spot,
maintained the lead through the quarter pole, but was caught in the stretch while still on her left lead. TWO HANDS FULL was well off the pace early, gained
ground from the five path and was in within striking distance by the three eighths pole, angled out at the quarter pole, was encouraged down the lane and
closed well and got up for third. SWEETASBAILY settled in the back of the field early, traveled in the six path, swung out at the quarter pole, and was no
factor. HIGHER NOTE was anxious in the gates while waiting for the start, vied for the early lead but was bounced around between foes, took back and
angled out, made up ground through the turn but stopped in the stretch. IDDY BIDDY vied for the early lead from the outside, settled off the pace, bid at the
quarter pole but tired while running on her left lead.

Footnotes
COURTHOUSE COVE pressed two wide, failed to gain outside of the leader in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, changed over at the furlong
grounds, produced a bid shortly after, dueled through the late stages, and forged an advantage. HE'S A BOMB bobble slightly for half a stride soon after the
start, set the pace along the inside, held sway from a pressing foe through upper stretch, dug in to resist that foe's bid in the final furlong, dueled through the
late stages, but was bested. KEEN HEIR chased three wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with the top two at the quarter pole, and held
show. FLAT OUT AMERICAN trailed in the two path, and offered some late interest. SPECIAL OPERATOR saved ground off of the pace, improved to vie
for show in upper stretch, but tired in the final furlong. MULTI PLATINUM tracked four wide, and faded.

Footnotes
JACK A ROSE showed good early speed, was able to take command of the race early, comfortably attended the pace, and responded to steady urging
down the lane with a determined finish. HE'S GOT THIS left the gates and easily ended up on the front end from the four path, took back a bit and settled in
hands down the backside, moved closer to the rail while saving ground, stayed within striking distance while still being relaxed, was asked after the three
eighths pole and willingly responded, continued to gain ground at the eighth mile pole was asked for an all out run and responded gamely but needed more
room. FIELDSTONE was well back early, saved ground from the rail, was urged to catch up around the half, split horses at the five eighths pole, continued
through the turn but flattened out in the lane. BONUS APPRECIATION was off a step slow, raced from the three path through the first turn while passing
another rival, angled back to the rail and saved ground, starting moving at the half mile pole, made short work out of catching up, while still on the rail, cut
the corner and came down the lane while still gaining momentum, aimed for the leader but just had too much to make up but raced gamely. MILLARD'S
SMILE raced off the pace from the five path and had no impact. CRIMINAL DEFENSE was never involved. CLARESTOWN vied for the early lead, stayed
on and matched strides with the other horse on the front from the three path and faded down the lane.

Footnotes
UNCLE BERLEY was bumped by an outer rival into an inner rival in a chain reaction at the start, tracked along the inside, took aim outside of the clear
leader turning for home, bid entering the lane, led in upper stretch, and inched clear in the final furlong. CELLULOID HERO took contact from an outer rival
causing him to bump an inner foe at the start, sped clear early on, met the eventual winner's bid entering the lane, got headed in upper stretch, and kept on
in the final furlong to narrowly hold place. FORCIBLE ENTRY broke in and bumped inner rivals at the start, tracked three wide, trailed at the five furlong
pole, tucked and saved ground around the far turn, improved entering the lane before shifting ground outwardly in upper stretch, and stayed on to just miss
reaching place. CONRAD THE RED broke slowly, but avoided being pinched between horses in the process, trailed in the two path around the first turn,
lacked progress in the three path under urging around the far turn, fanned to the vie path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. TRYSTINTHENITEAWAY
took contact from an outer rival at the start, stalked the clear leader from the two path, but tired in the three path around the far turn.

Footnotes
CAMP AKEELA set the pace while well in hand, shook clear of pressers nearing the lane, shifted out approaching midstretch as an outer rival gave chase,
and fended off that foe through the late stages. MORE THAN GLORY broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, stalked along the inside, took aim
outside of the clearing leader leaving the quarter pole, shifted ground outwardly along with that foe approaching midstretch to remain outside of her, and
was kept at bay through the final furlong. HECKLED was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, tracked two wide, tugged between horses
entering the far turn, fanned to five path entering the lane, bumped an inner foe at the three sixteenths while greenly flopping leads and vying foe show, and
secured that position thereafter. PAINT ME PERFECT pressed outside of the leader, but yielded in the four path entering the lane before taking a bump
from an outer rival at the three sixteenths pole, and kept on. CALM COOL lacked speed along the inside, pursued while shifting out to the three path around
the far turn, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and failed to factor. CORNER KICK broke a bit awkwardly while off a beat slow, tracked three wide,
but was floated to the six path entering the lane, and gave way. CAPELLA RED took a bump from an inner rival at the star, and got outrun.

Footnotes
MAESTRIA set a clear pace, and held sway from a chasing foe through the lane. RUE LALA stalked along the inside, gained place while tipping a bit off of
the rail in upper stretch, then chased the leader home to prove second best. SPEEDY DUDETTE bumped an outer rival at the start, trailed in the four path
around the turn, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and stayed on. OURS AND THEIRS settled off of the pace in the two path, then moved up
inside of foes. HEI HEI CUSTIVITY stalked four to three wide into the turn, but faded four wide in upper stretch. SIENNA BREEZE chased two wide and
from between horses, but gave way three wide in upper stretch. SOPHIE'S PRAYER chased briefly three wide and between horse, but failed to sustain that
position at the half mile pole, and faded along the inside around the turn. WON DAY was bumped by an inner rival at the start, lacked speed in the four path,
and tired.
