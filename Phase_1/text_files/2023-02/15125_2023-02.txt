Footnotes
TRUMPENCE with the pace from the start outside, dueled in the three path through the turn, disposed of the other speed inside the furlong grounds to be
clear, enough left to hold the place. STORMIN HONGKONG lacked early foot, moved off the inside, began to advance three wide midway on the turn,
widest for the drive, steadily getting to the winner while too late. RELEASED behind the first flight along the inside, moved out in the two path for the drive,
modest gain late on the top pair, nod for the show. CABOT moved up to duel in the two path, raced on equal terms with the winner through the turn to that
one's inside, first to blink past the furlong marker. BRAVO BRAVO settled off the pace and the inside, four wide out of the turn, lacked a closing kick;. HEZA
WILD RIDE in mid pack early, began to fade in the two path midway on the turn. MORNING SNOW off a step slow, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HAIL COLUMBIA broke alertly, quickly cleared her opposition, bit of a breather through the turn, turned back a mild bid from the runner up past the furlong
marker, increased advantage under a steady right handed crop. VEGAS BLUE chased the winner into the turn off the inside, lost some ground while in the
three path into the lane, lodged a brief and mild bid nearing midstretch then could not keep up, clearly second best. STAR POSE lacked early foot, saved
some ground through the turn, came off the rail a bit for the drive, improved to be clear of the others, not a threat to the top pair. MARTIQUE MISS off a step
slow, raced back for a half, angled out to be four wide exiting the turn, staged a mild rally outside to improve position. ESSENTIAL BELLA hesitated at the
start, moved up outside to race in the main body into the turn, continued to improve a bit through the turn, flattened out in the drive. MRS. NUSHI off step
slow, settled off the pace while between horses early, angled in a bit to save some ground through the turn, had little for the drive. NO DRAMA MOMMA in
the second flight early while three wide and between foes into the turn, failed to respond when called on for the drive. AIN'TNOSWEETIE within striking
distance early, four wide through the turn, steadily faded. FLAG TO FLAG fell back to trail after the start, showed little to be always outrun.

Footnotes
COLONEL BOWMAN lacked early foot, raced back and between rivals, advanced three to four wide through the turn, outside bid past the furlong marker,
kicked well clear under steady handling. CHAPEL BARN in the second flight and inside the winner, could not keep with that one late in the turn, raced in the
two path out of the turn, finished with some mild late interest while once again between horses late, narrowly gained the nod for the place. SIDETOWN
dueled up front along the inside, fell back off the other speed turn, moved out and was three wide and outside that one nearing midstretch, could not match
strides with the winner late, nipped for the second spot in the final strides. BLACK STORM off a step slow, void of speed for a half, two path into the lane,
found best stride too late through and around traffic. SPEND BENJAMINS in mid pack while along the inside, continued to save ground through the turn,
lacked a closing response while continuing along the rail. MYSTERY MAN hopped at the start to be slowly away, lacked speed, three wide late in the turn,
failed to rally. FREUDIAN FATE raced back and outside, four wide early in the turn, floated out a bit by a tiring LOVE MY JIMMY in deep stretch, failed to
threaten. LOVE MY JIMMY dueled early off the inside, shook clear in the turn, continued to hold the advantage when straightened for home, caved the final
furlong.

Footnotes
ARTHURIAN broke well from along the inside, showed the way up the backstretch by daylight, turned back a brief bid from the runner up late in the turn and
into the stretch, drew well clear under a brisk left handed crop. DRENA'S STAR in the second flight up the backstretch three wide, closer and lodged a brief
bid outside the winner turning for home, proved no match in the run to the wire lasted for the second spot. GRAPNEL off the pace while well out in the strip,
four wide midway on the bend, staged a mild rally to be getting to the runner up. COAL TRUTH broke back, lacked speed in the two path, improved into the
lane inside of a few rivals, flattened out a bit and was going evenly at the end. TITLE SHOT last away, trailed early inside, continued to save some ground
turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. TOWN CHAMP in the second flight well out in the strip, shuffled back into the turn,
four to five wide after recovering, failed to rally. SMILEFORME chased the winner in the two path, faltered from between horses late in the turn, continued to
fade through the lane. LANSDOWNE six wide into the turn when off the pace, worked way down to the four path exiting, backed up.

Footnotes
BET HE'S READY broke alertly, soon sprinted clear, showed the way into and through the turn toward the inside, saw that margin shrink into the stretch,
roused past the furlong marker, responded and pulled away late under firm handling. LIFE ON THE NILE closest to the winner to that one's outside in the
run up the backstretch, crept a bit closer while being asked late in the turn, could get no closer nearing the furlong marker, no match, remained well clear of
the others. CYCLONE in the main group while between horses up the backstretch, three down to two path turn, finished up best of the rest. UNSTABLE
PRINCE in mid pack while widest up the backstretch, five to four wide by midway on the bend, one paced through the stretch to finished up evenly.
CONTRABANDISTA off the pace well out in the strip and between rivals, four wide in some traffic early in the turn, had little for the stretch run as well.
EIGHT STRAIGHT saved ground well off the pace, failed to muster a rally. INFILTRATOR remained always back while racing just off the inside. TEXAS
PHAROAH off a step slow, moved up behind traffic, took up in tight quarters into the turn, fell back off the issue while three wide through the remainder of
the bend, did not recover.

Footnotes
LAPIS LAZULI forwardly placed early outside, moved up to join the fray up front into the turn, dueled through the bend and through the length of the stretch,
brush, fully extended to prevail. LORD GRANTHAM with the pace from the start, garnered a larger advantage into the turn, hooked up with the winner soon
after inside that one, extended duel while remaining closest to the inside, outfinished. IMMORAL in mid pack early while racing outside, four wide through
the turn, chased the top two past the furlong marker and was slowly closing the gap on that pair late while remaining out in the strip. HAPPY BOY ROCKET
off a step slow, trailed early while moving off the inside, angled out further to be five wide turning for home, turned in a mild rally while not a serious threat.
MARK THE MOOSE lacked early foot, raced back, improved position into the stretch while in the two path, flattened out the final furlong. SKYLINE in the
second flight along the inside, weakened in the drive. THE FIVE B'S lacked early foot outside, four out to five wide early in the turn, continued in the five
path out of the bend, failed to rally. PRACTICAL MAN in mid pack off rail, shuffled back from between horses late backstretch, remained back to the wire.
GALACTIC EMPIRE pressed the runner up early from the outside, stopped from between that rival and the winner midway on the turn, stopped through the
stretch to trail home.

Footnotes
DISC JOCKEY prompted the pace from the outside, four down to three wide when moving to challenge early in the far turn, long drive, edged clear late
while being kept to pressure. HELLORHIGHWATER took command into the first turn, narrowly set the pace while along the inside, responded when
confronted in the second turn, vied into the lane, proved stubborn in the drive in grudgingly yielding to the winner, game for the place. FIFTY CENT
DOLLARS broke on top, pressed the runner up just to that one's outside, challenged between that foe and the winner in the second turn, vied while
remaining between horses upper stretch, weakened bit late. INTREPID HEART last to leave, trailed early off the inside, moved a bit closer after a half, four
wide turning for home, went evenly through; the stretch in lacking a significant closing response. THUNDERSHOOK steadied in traffic into the first turn, fell
back inside, was never dangerous while continuing to save ground into the stretch. LORD DRAGON settled off the pace three wide, continued off the inside
second turn, one paced to the wire in lacking a closing punch. THOUGHT in traffic then steadied between horses into the first turn, pulled in mid pack up the
backstretch, backed up in the drive.

Footnotes
RUN FEARLESS broke with the field, fell back while unhurried soon after, three wide under patient handling through most of the turn, came four out to five
wide for the drive, light bump midstretch, furious late rally to be up in the final jump. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER broke in, set the early pace along the inside,
responded when challenged into the lane, dueled past the furlong marker, led late, nipped at the wire. CHOCTAW CHARLIE broke alertly, raced forwardly
and off the inside, moved to challenge turning for home, dueled through the stretch, gave ground grudgingly to the top pair late. PATTERN BET in tight at
the start, raced in the second group while between horses, steadied when in tight once again midway on the turn, fell back a bit but stayed on to be closing
the gap in the late going. WAR MUSIC lurked behind the first flight outside, four wide through the turn, bumped slightly with the winner inside that one past
the furlong marker, finished up evenly. TAPIT RIGHT broke out to tighten up outer rivals, raced within striking distance inside, had little left for the drive.
MOCHA KISS pressed the runner up off the inside for a half, began to weaken late in the turn. BLOW SUM SMOKE void of speed, moved a bit closer
behind traffic late in the turn, three wide into the lane, remained behind a wall of rival upper stretch, finished up evenly the final furlong. OOCHIE moved
inside after the start, continued to save some ground turn, no factor stretch, jogged in. SERIOUSLY SASSY forced in at the break, fell well back, jogged in.

Footnotes
STILL ON THE BOOKS in the second flight while toward the inside, in traffic through the turn, two path into the lane, roused from between horses, finished
full of run to win going away. IMPOVERISHED broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, remained clear past the furlong marker, proved no match for the
winner, held sway for the place late. AUX ARCS settled off the pace and the inside, came three then moved out four wide for the drive, mild rally to be along
for the show. KISSOFTHENILE in mid pack outside, five wide into the turn, four wide exiting, lodged a brief bid nearing midstretch, flattened out in the late
going. NATORADE dwelt at the start, trailed well back toward the inside, three wide into the stretch, shifted out a bit further then made some excellent
progress to improve position down the middle of the strip. JOE BILL void of speed, in the two path through the turn, also improved position with some
belated interest. EL MONGO broke in, bumped with UPTOWN SOCIAL, recovered to race forwardly and three wide into the turn, moved out four wide
turning for home, came up empty for the stretch run. HACKER in traffic, fell back backstretch, moved out, five wide through the turn, made little impact
through the stretch. KRUSIN ROCKET forwardly placed and four wide into the far turn, pressed three wide through late in the turn, weakened in the drive.
UPTOWN SOCIAL bumped at the break, failed to menace after saving ground. FIVE O FOX pressed the runner up from the outside for a half, gave way in
the drive. RIDGEPOINT ROAD finished early while five wide into the turn.
