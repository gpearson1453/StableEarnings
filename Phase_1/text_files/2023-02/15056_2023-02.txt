and gained ground to the wire. TAPINTOYOURBEER raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch,
continued around the far bend still in the three path and weakened in the lane. ARIES REIGNS raced in the three path early, led the way on the inside up
the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the far turn and tired in the stretch. COMMANDER KEITH saved ground around the first turn, trailed the
field on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back while racing in the two path around the second turn and was empty from there.
