Footnotes
LOT'SA SILVER was quick to begin to set the early pace and remained well clear in the stretch under steady handling. WANDAS CAFE raced in tight at the
break, raced near the back of the pack early on, moved up along the inside around the far turn through the stretch but was no match for the winner. DIXIE
TRIXIE chased the pace, raced four deep around the far turn and kept on to the wire. POPS GIRL ALEXA raced four to five wide into the upper stretch and
raced evenly with no late gain. SANDPLUM CREEK was hustled from the outside, raced five wide around the far turn and never was a factor. PIZZA GIRL
chased the early pace while racing two wide and gave way. The three eighths fractional time was unavailable.

TOUGH COMPANY rated along the inside in the early stages, moved up to challenge four deep near the quarter pole and finished gamely to just prevail
under all out pressure. PRAIRIE SQUALL showed good early foot to a pressured pace from the inside of rival, dug in and just missed in game effort.
CAESARTHERULER pressed the early leader from the outside and kept on willingly to the wire. DANCE FOR RANSOM stalked the pace, raced from the
inside into the upper stretch and had not enough. HATTIES JEWEL was bumped, squeezed at the break, raced off the early going, raced four wide in the

DRINK settled off the early going, moved up through the far turn from the outside of foes, surged late while racing five deep and proved best under strong
pressure. AWESOME FAMILY broke to the outside, pressed the early pace racing three wide early and finished gamely to the wire. HOT ARTIE vied for the
early lead from the inside and gave way grudgingly. LITTLE TOE was unhurried early, raced three deep around the far turn and had no late rally. SMART
BATTLE pressed the early pace while racing between rivals and gave way. FINDING SILVER lunged at the break, settled off the early going near the inside
and never was a factor.

Footnotes
REACH THE CIRCLE stalked the top trio, moved up through a narrow opening along the rail near the eighth pole, was bumped near the sixteenth pole and
just got up under strong pressure. COLD SNACK THIRTY dueled for the early lead from the outside of foes three deep and just missed in a game effort.
PREACHER dueled for the lead from the inside, bumped near the sixteenth pole and finished gamely to the wire. RETALIATED raced five deep into the
upper stretch and closed in late. NORTH SIDE dueled for the early lead between rivals and weakened the final eighth of a mile. JUST RIGHT MIKE raced
evenly and never threatened. SCOOTER'S BOY raced near the inside and never was a factor. BAOZUN was off slowly and trailed.
