CLEARLY UNHINGED broke inward then went up to take control from inside, set the pace with CURL GIRL to the outside, inched ahead leaving the
backstretch, took some pressure again on the turn then moved clear with a quarter mile left to run, drew away in upper stretch when given her cue, shown
the whip in the final sixteenth and remained clear to the wire. CONQUISTAR stalked the top pair from outside, rounded the bend three then four wide and
outfinished CURL GIRL for second. CURL GIRL broke inward then went up to press the pace from outside, lost a bit of ground nearing the turn, drew
alongside the leader again past the three-eighths pole, could not sustain the challenge approaching the quarter pole and got edged for the place honors.
CLIQUISH veered in at the start, sat off the pace early, raced on the inside into the turn, angled out and came four wide into the drive and lacked a rally.
CON SEAL AND KERRY stalked the pace early and moved down to the two path, continued two wide into the lane and faded. BEST YEAR EVER came
away slow and broke in, lost his path behind CON SEAL AND KERRY early, trailed two wide into the stretch and never made an impact.

HACKING IT UP settled inside, took closer order in the middle stages, tipped two wide then between rivals at the quarter pole, drew alongside the leader at
the eighth pole, took over midstretch, lugged inward in the final sixteenth and drew clear. PLEASE FOCUS stalked the pace on the inside then started to pull
on the first turn while moving to the two path, continued to tug early on the backstretch before settling, made a swift move from outside and took over at the
five-sixteenths pole, cleared inner rival approaching the quarter pole, challenged by HACKING IT UP at the eighth pole, relinquished the lead in midstretch,
got floated in by that rival lugging inward in the final sixteenth and held the place. TOM AND JAZZY tracked two wide early, ran up behind rivals and lacked
room midway around the far turn, continued in the two path into the lane, found the rail in the stretch had to put on the breaks when losing his path late.
THIRSTY PAPPY tracked two wide early on, chased three deep at the quarter pole and weakened down the lane. MILA'S PAPA hopped slightly at the start
but was quickly jumped out to the early lead, showed the way near the inside to the far turn, failed to offer much resistance when engaged PLEASE FOCUS
on the far turn, relinquished the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, chased along the rail into the lane and retreated.

Footnotes
LOOKIN FOR REVENGE set the pace on the inside under pressure from DERBY STORM, moved clear approaching the half-mile pole, coaxed along with a
quarter mile left to run, urged right handed into the stretch, then switched to left hand and drew away under steady handling late. OUTRIGHT bobbled in the
beginning, chased three deep into the first turn, got put in tight and suffered a mild shuffle early on the bend then angled to the four path, gained from
outside around the far turn and took aim three wide into the lane, proved no match for the winner in the stretch run but kept on for a clear second.
PEPPERMAN chased between foes early then outside a rival on the backstretch, went three then four wide on the second turn and flattened in the lane.
CLAIM OF PASSION was rated early four then three deep on the first turn, was closest in pursuit entering the far turn from the three path, chased two wide
into the lane and weakened. VICENTE'S SHADOW broke a step slow, tracked the pace on the inside, pressed on while continuing to save ground through
the far turn and came up empty. DERBY STORM prompted the pace from outside then lost touch and chased past the midway point, dropped back two
wide on the far turn, came out into the stretch and tired.

LOYAL TO A FAULT broke a step slow, went up to vie from inside then pressed the leader up the backstretch, moved up on even terms into the bend, took
a short lead while dueling on the turn, cleared into the stretch and drew off under right handed urging and was in hand nearing the wire. SMOOVE AS SILK
stalked along the inside and got bumped at the half-mile pole, tipped to the two path on the far turn, went between foes then drifted in and bumped rival in
upper stretch, kept on willingly and bested the rest. TIMELY LUCK drifted in early, stalked four deep then bumped repeatedly with SMOKEMONTHECLIFF
near the half-mile pole, took aim three wide into the stretch and lacked a bid. SMILING AMY showed early speed while drifting in early then became a bit
rank, set the pace outside the winner up the backstretch, lost command and dueled around the turn, lost touch into the stretch and weakened.
SMOKEMONTHECLIFF was off slow to begin, steadied behind a rival early, bumped repeatedly three deep at the half-mile pole, angled in on the turn, got
bumped and crowded by SMOOVE AS SILK in upper stretch and weakened. PALACSINTA away quickly in the beginning, bobbled crossing over the dirt,
got bumped and steadied between rivals at the half-mile pole, trailed two wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
VIOLENT RUNNER stalked the leading on the inside then moved into the two path, asked right handed approaching the quarter pole, spun four wide into
the lane, reached the front in midstretch and drove clear. LIV AND LET LIV set the pace under pressure from outside rival, shook free past the
five-sixteenths pole, led into the final furlong but was soon passed by the winner in midstretch and kept on to save second. MISS FIA broke a step slow then
dropped back early, trailed three then two wide around the bend, drifted out in the lane and showed a mild late bid but could not get up for second.
EVERLYS GIRL was off slow in the beginning, sat off the pace on the inside, saved ground through the turn and summoned a mild rally to whittle the gap
late. DEL MAR DRAMA raced off the pace outside a rival into the turn, moved three then four wide around the turn, steered out further in the drive and
never threatened. ARDIS pressed the pace from outside, chased two wide past the five-sixteenths pole and weakened.

PRINCE ABAMA (IRE) stalked three wide early then between foes off the pace, moved into range for the far turn, tipped out into the stretch, rallied from
outside and got up in the closing moments. MASTEROFFOXHOUNDS brushed with outer rival in the beginning, stalked two wide then moved inside, moved
off the rail and challenged the leader at the seven-sixteenths pole, dueled around the far turn and took over with a quarter mile remaining, shook free in
upper stretch, led clear into the final sixteenth and got nailed near the wire. OPRY brushed with inner rival at the start, took back and angled to the inside,
moved closer leaving the backstretch, roused two wide into the lane, finished willingly under right handed encouragement but lacked the needed late punch.
SAY THE WORD angled in early and was reserved along the fence, saved ground through the far turn, moved off the rail in the lane and finished well to
round out the superfecta. THE GREY WIZARD (IRE) angled into the two path while racing near the back, saved ground on the far turn from inside, went
between rivals with a sixteenth remaining and summoned a mild rally. DICEY MO CHARA (GB) chased six wide crossing over the dirt, settled off the pace
two to three wide and between rivals under a hold, continued between on the far turn, put to right handed urging at the top of the stretch, lacked room
through the final furlong but kept on to improve. YES THIS TIME forwardly placed four wide early then stalked in the two path outside a rival, chased three
wide on the far turn, moved out further in the lane and flattened out. AVENUE broke slow on the outside, raced three deep at the back early then four deep
into the backstretch, remained wide through the final turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to menace. EVAN HARLAN took control early from
inside, controlled the pace along the rail, challenged into the far turn and dueled around the bend, lost command at the quarter pole and weakened in the
furlong grounds. CASH EQUITY (FR) chased five wide crossing the dirt then rated outside a pair of rivals, came five wide into the stretch and weakened in
the drive.

HOPKINS was closest in pursuit of STRAIGHT NO CHASER up the backstretch, bid outside that rival near the five-sixteenths pole, inched ahead outside
the eight pole, then kicked clear and drew away. RADICAL RIGHT got crowded between rivals and bumped early, went two wide into the turn, angled to the
inside then tipped back out while gaining on the turn, entered the stretch three wide, finished willingly through the lane but had to settle for second best.
STRAIGHT NO CHASER took control early from inside, challenged from outside around the bend, held a short lead into the stretch, lost command outside
the eighth pole and flattened to third. HOWBEIT stalked three wide into the turn, dropped back between rivals, trailed two wide into the stretch and kept on
to regain a minor award. MCLAREN VALE got bumped from inside early then settle well off the rail, rounded the turn four wide, came five wide into the
stretch and lacked a rally. ESCAPE ROUTE tracked outside a rival, raced four wide into the stretch and lacked further response.

photo. DOITFORANDREW (GB) showed early speed then ceded command, stalked three wide, drew alongside the top pair at the halfway point, drifted out
a bit crossing the dirt, took over then dueled with TULSA TORNADO down the stretch, battled head to head in the final sixteenth and got edged at the wire.
DEGREE OF RISK pulled early then steadied into the turn, traveled three wide then moved out around the bend, came five wide into the lane and got up for
the show honors. LOVESICK BLUES brushed leaving the gate, tracked on the inside then two wide into the lane, lacked room from upper to midstretch,
gained a clear path along the inside and got outkicked for third. GREGORY'S PRIDE sat off the pace, went five deep around the turn and lacked a late bid.
LOST IN SPACE (IRE) trailed on the inside then two wide on the turn, drifted out crossing the dirt, lacked room and had to altered out from behind rivals in
the stretch and kept on to improve. VIRAT stalked off the rail, got boxed in three deep on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved out and could not
rally. AUGUSTA MELODY forwardly placed while keen early, went two wide into the turn then along the rail, moved out in the stretch run and failed to rally.
ADARE was off a bit slow and brushed with inner rival, pulled between early, came three wide into the stretch and flattened out. SQUARE CAT set the pace
under pressure from the winner, lost command crossing over the dirt and faded in the final furlong. LAW ABIDING chased four deep, drifted into the stretch,
eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
EXAULTED stalked on the inside early out of range, moved out on the far turn and took aim three wide into the stretch, collared the leader with a furlong
remaining and drove clear. CARMELITA'S MAN brushed the side of the gate, unhurried in the early going and moved inside, moved out on the backstretch,
went four deep into the far turn, was on the move through the bend, came five wide into the stretch, finished well through the lane and outkicked LINCOLN
HAWK (IRE) for second. LINCOLN HAWK (IRE) unhurried on the inside, got blocked behind a rival from the seven-sixteenths to the three-eighths pole,
steered out around the far turn and came four to five wide into the stretch, angled out widest in the lane, rallied in tandem with CARMELITA'S MAN and got
edged for second. MECKLENBURG (IRE) stalked early then rushed up to challenge for command from outside into the first turn, dueled from outside
around the bend then inched ahead, moved clear at the five-eighths pole, showed the way into the stretch, collared with a furlong remaining and flattened to
fourth. SCRIPT raced between then outside a rival off the pace, moved out at the eighth pole and needed to find more late. LUVLUV traveled two wide then
between rivals near the back, got boxed in at the three-eighths pole, went between rivals again at the quarter pole, tipped out in the lane and improved
position. FLASHIEST was a bit fractious in the gate, broke slow in the beginning, traveled two wide outside a rival at the back, moved out and started to
move on the backstretch, gained through the far turn outside rivals and came four wide into the stretch but faltered in the furlong grounds. RED ROAD
tracked two wide off the pace, moved closer while saving ground on the far turn but weakened in the late stages. RIP CITY sprinted clear from outside and
crossed over, dueled with outside rival around the clubhouse turn, lost touch with that rival and stalked past the five-eighths pole, chased two wide into the
lane and weakened. KANDEREL saved ground through both turns and failed to make an impact. MAN FRIDAY sat off the pace three deep, entered the lane
four wide and came up empty.
