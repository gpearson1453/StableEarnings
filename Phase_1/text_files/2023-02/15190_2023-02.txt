Footnotes
TRIPLE START stalked the pace in the two path, angled four wide in upper stretch, closed outside, was up leaving the sixteenth pole and lasted under
steady right-handed urging. RED'S REVENGE was bumped after the start, raced off the pace three wide, steadied near the five-sixteenths pole, angled to
the rail soon after, rallied at the rail under hand urging and just missed. RIO MOON set the pace in the two path, battled on between foes to deep stretch
and gave way grudgingly. LEAVENWORTH broke a bit awkwardly, raced off the pace two and three wide and had a mild rally. LOVE SPELL pressed the
pace in the three path, reached even terms nearing the quarter pole and faded under minimal stretch urging. BREAK THE ICE saved ground and failed to
menace. COOL SLIPPERS (IRE) played no factor while racing three wide. CLASSIC BOURBON hit the starting gate, moved up to track the pace four wide
and faded in the lane. HOLIDAY FANTASY was bumped after the start, raced well back inside early, went five wide around the far turn and never
threatened. LUSCIOUS DANCER was bumped between foes and forced to check sharply not long after the start, saved ground and was never involved.
ENZO'S WORLD chased the pace three and four wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
DANGER RANGER trailed in the two path into the turn, was ridden in the three path around the turn and fanned out to the eight path at the top of the lane,
rallied down the center, took command nearing the sixteenth pole, and drew clear. PAPA KATZ chased in the the six path into the turn, ranged up in the five
path turning into the stretch and bid, ran on to take the lead while angling in going into the final furlong, but was caught by an outer foe nearing the sixteenth
pole to finish with place. CORPORATE AFFAIR stalked in the five path and was roused into the turn, was in the four path around the turn and tipped out to
the six path into the stretch, and was one pace through the stretch to finish with show. EXTRACTION WILL raced prominently in the two path, was cued
between rivals around the turn and floated out to the three path into the lane, but flattened passing the eighth pole. CAJUN PUZZLER set the pace along
the inside into the turn, was roused midway around the and was challenged by outer foes while tipping out to the two path into the stretch, and yielded
passing the eighth pole. ROCK SOLID WORDS brushed the side of the gate and broke a bit awkwardly, tracked along the inside into the turn, was coaxed
in the two path around the turn and shifted back inside entering the lane, but was tired. SUPER GREMLIN was prompted along in the four path into the turn,
was driven in the three path around the turn, but was empty while back in the four path in the stretch.

HEY PORTER hit the starting gate, raced off the pace outside, advanced three and four wide around the turn, moved to the front in midstretch and drew
clear under a drive. GRAN ANDREWS stalked the pace inside, made a rail bid in upper stretch, was no match for the winner but lasted for the place.
APPRAISAL raced off the pace four wide and rallied outside to just miss second. NEVER SATISFIED prompted the pace two wide, took the lead near the
five-sixteenths pole but tired in the lane. ASTROTURF failed to menace while racing two and three wide. CHIQUIRIN had his head turned at the start, saved
ground and made little impact. PIYPA DE LYNDA played no factor while racing three wide. STRASBOURG chased the pace outside down the backstretch,
angled to the rail nearing the turn and retreated. SOVEREIGN OF SPEED set the pace along the rail and gave way near the five-sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
SUMMER CAUSE traveled in the two path around the first turn and was held up while in range from the four path down the backstretch, received a right
handed cue in the five path passing the three eighths pole and ranged up around the far turn, took aim from the six path into the stretch, and rallied in the
final furlong under right handed urging to get up in the final sixteenth for the win. GAME WARDEN raced in the three path around the first turn and was
unhurried in the four path down the backstretch, was roused from said position passing the three eighths pole and moved up turning into the lane, ran on
while trying to split horses under left handed urging passing the eighth pole, and got up for place in a photo. TSHIEBWE stalked in the three path rounding
the first turn and was in the five path down the backstretch, was roused to bid in the four path around the far turn and took the lead from the five path into
the stretch, kept on under steady urging through the stretch, but was caught on both sides nearing the finish to show. FIGHTERTOWN set the pace inside,
was roused in the two path around the far turn, lost the lead while floating out to the three path into the lane, and yielded. SGT. PEPPER rated in the two
path, was inside of foes around the far turn, but was no menace. IMMENSE FAITH prompted the pace in the three path down the backstretch, was coaxed
into the far turn, but gaveway around the far turn.

Footnotes
MAX K. O. had early speed inside, rated back nearing the first turn, re-bid two wide around the far turn, tipped three wide in upper stretch, closed outside,
struck the front in deep stretch and lost the head bob to finish on even terms. LUCKY CURLIN raced in range two wide, took the lead nearing the eighth
pole, led to deep stretch and just lasted for a share of the win. MEGACITY dueled two wide around the first turn, drew clear down the backstretch, set the
pace along the rail from there to midstretch and kept on inside for the show. CALIBRATOR dueled along the rail around the first turn, chased inside when
MEGACITY cleared off early on the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and was one-paced in the lane. LIGHT FURY saved ground
off the pace, advanced three wide between foes rounding the far turn, steadied near the quarter pole and had no further bids. HEALING trailed inside,
swung widest in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. BORDER TOWN played no factor while racing two and three wide.

AFFIRMATIVE LADY stalked along the inside around the first turn and was in the two path down the backstretch, was roused passing the quarter pole but
had to steady slightly into the lane, found a seem in the three path and rallied to split horses in the final furlong, and drew clear. JUST MY OWN prompted
the pace in the three path, was roused to bid around the far turn and was in the four path at the top of the lane, and chased home the winner for place.
OCEAN CLUB set the pace inside, was roused from the two path turning into the stretch, but yielded to a pair of outer foes to show. ARROW BOLT was in
the two path around the first turn and tracked in the three path down the backstretch, was driven around the far turn and swung out to the seven path into
the lane, and finished evenly. BILOXI BLUES traveled in the three path around the first turn and was held up while in range from the four into the
backstretch, was ridden around the far turn and tipped out to the six path into the stretch, but flattened. NOTHING BUT PUMPS was unhurried in the two
path, tipped inside around the far turn, angled out to the five path into the lane, but drifted out to the center under left handed urging and did no threaten.
MILAN MISCHIEF trailed along the inside around the first turn and was in the five path down the backstretch, was cued into the far turn but was no menace.
HER LADYSHIP rated in the two path down the backstretch, but was empty going into the stretch.

Footnotes
FLY THE W prompted the pace four wide, seized command near the five-sixteenths marker and drew off under a drive. CONGLOMERATE settled off the
pace while racing three and four wide and finished willingly to gain the place. BRYCE CANYON set the pace along the rail, was collared by the winner near
the five-sixteenths pole, was no match for that foe but kept on to save the show. SOUPER ENERGIZER was squeezed back soon after the start, saved
ground off the pace around the first turn, advanced five wide around the far turn but lacked the needed stretch rally. MOMZA stalked the pace two wide and
tired in the drive. CADET CORPS failed to menace while racing two and three wide. POPPY'S BOYS hopped at the start, made little impact while racing two
wide and was vanned off. TELEPHONE TALKER prompted the pace three wide and faltered in in the lane. BRACCIO DI FERRO was outrun inside.

Footnotes
YOU LOOK COLD brushed with an outer foe at the start, stalked along the inside was roused in the two path midway around the turn, angled out entering
the lane and surged past a trio of inner rivals inside the final furlong to draw clear. DREAMSTER brushed between rivals at the start, trailed in the three path
into the turn, ranged up in the four path around the turn and bid into the stretch, but was outrun by an outer foe, and ran on for place. ROSIE'S HALO
brushed with an inner foe leaving the gate, tracked in the three path, bid between foes around the turn, and kept on from the three path in the stretch for
show. LA CHICA LATERAL set the pace inside, was roused when headed around the turn, dug in under right handed urging into the final furlong, but
evened out late. BROADWAY FORCE raced in range from the two path into the turn, fanned out to the six path into the stretch, but was no factor. PEACHY
WEACHY prompted the early pace in the two path, bid between rivals around the turn, but gaveway into the lane. TEXIAN brushed between foes at the
start, rated along the inside but was no menace from the three path in the stretch.

Footnotes
REGAL REALM set the pace in the two path, edged clear down the backstretch, set a clear pace along the rail around the far turn and held clear under a
drive. DIAMOND HANDS prompted the winner in the three path, could not gain on that foe in the lane but fended off a rival to hold the place. MONA
STELLA tracked the pace two wide, tipped out in upper stretch and had a mild gain. WILLAKIA was bumped at the start, steadied along through the opening
half, advanced five wide around the far turn and improved position in the lane. I'M SO SORRY chased the pace four wide and faded through the stretch.
DISTINCTLYPOSSIBLE broke outwardly and bumped at the start, saved ground in midpack and never threatened. AVOW steadied nearing the first turn,
saved ground and made little impact. MISS MATTIE B failed to menace while racing three and four wide. IMPROVISE (FR) played no factor while racing
four and five wide. CLASSIC LADY was outrun while racing three and four wide. LAY THE GROUNDWORK raced five wide and was never involved.
STANDOFF was rank early, chased the pace three wide between foes, steadied in upper stretch and retreated.

Footnotes
BANKER'S HOURS stalked in the two path, was roused while tipping out to the five path into the stretch, bid to take the lead in upper stretch and opened up
slightly into the final furlong, and held off a late charging outer rival to win. NEOPHYTE bumped the outer side of the gate at the start and rated in the two
path, ranged up in the four path around the turn and was urged right handed while tipping out to the seven path into the stretch, and rallied for place.
HARRY'S ONTHEBEACH trailed in the three path into the turn, was roused passing the quarter pole and angled out to the six path into the stretch, and ran
on between rivals for show. CUPID'S DART raced off the pace in the four path, was coaxed in the five path around the turn and urged right handed from the
seven path into the lane, and kept on. VILLEGAS SWING brushed with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the four path, was in the three path around the
turn and cued right handed from the four path into the lane, but was one paced under light handling. NAVAL OFFICER brushed with an inner foe at the start,
prompted the pace in the five path, was in the four path around the turn, but flattened in the stretch. JOYFUL SURPRISE dueled for the lead in the three
path, took a narrow lead while under a ride into the lane, but yielded going into the final furlong. ON JET HEIR dueled along the inside but yielded from the
two path in the stretch. OUR NOBLE ORTEGA chased in the three path but was empty in the stretch.
