Footnotes
LIKE NO OTHER broke out at the start and was off a step slowly, was a bit keen on the first turn, stalked the modest pace through the backstretch run,
advanced three wide on the far turn, battled with CARMEL BY THE SEA to mid-stretch, disposed of the runner-up in deep stretch and kept to task late to
prove best. CARMEL BY THE SEA forwardly placed into the first turn, attended to the modest early fractions, reacted slightly to RIGHT REASONS jumping
a shadow to her inside entering the far turn, battled with LIKE NO OTHER to mid-stretch, could not keep pace with the winner in the final stages and
outfinished RIGHT REASONS to secure the place. RIGHT REASONS assumed command into the first turn, set modest fractions through the backstretch
run, jumped a shadow entering the far turn, came under pressure nearing the top of the lane, weakened in the drive and was outfinished for place, while
holding safely in the end for show. SWEET TESSA was away in good order then took back off of the early fractions, well placed through the backstretch run,
advanced nearing the quarter marker and lacked a late response. ROSE ROSE ROSE unhurried in the early stages, raced two wide through the
backstretch run while not far back, raced three wide to the quarter marker and did not threaten in the drive.

Footnotes
ESCAPE FREE (IRE) lunged slightly at the start, was off a half-beat slowly but was away in good order, tracked the decent early pace, was roused four
wide nearing the quarter marker, came within aim in mid-stretch, overtook LINGER inside of the furlong pole and kept to task while on the left lead to prevail.
ELA CALIMERA MOU unhurried in the early going, steadied off of heels leaving the first turn, settled through the backstretch run, encountered traffic
nearing the top of the lane, swung widest for the drive, closed well in deep stretch, could not reel in the winner and secured the place in the late stages.
TIZTHEHARTOFDIXIE allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground to the quarter marker, lacked room turning into the stretch, shifted four wide for
the drive, gained ground nearing the furlong pole, ran evenly in the final stages and was up in the final strides to dead heat for show. KOKO'S MOM
forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the decent early pace, saved ground to the quarter marker, was boxed in nearing the top of the lane and
continued to lack room into upper stretch, drifted out in mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final furlong and held for a share of third in the end. OAT MILK
LATTE stalked the decent early pace, advanced three wide on the second turn, could not sustain that run in the stretch and faded in the late stages.
LINGER showed good early speed and dictated terms in the early stages, set decent fractions while prompted to the second turn, was set down for the
drive, held foes at bay to mid-stretch, could not keep pace in the final furlong and gave way. CRY ME A RUNNER was prominent into the first turn, attended
to the decent fractions through the backstretch run, confronted LINGER nearing the quarter marker, lost ground leaving the second turn, came in tight and
steadied off of heels in mid-stretch when KOKO'S MOM drifted out, dropped back leaving the furlong pole and could not muster a late response. THERE
WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING IN MID-STRETCH. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT WHILE CRY ME
A RUNNER WAS IMPEDED BY KOKO'S MOM WHEN KOKO'S MOM DRIFTED OUT NEARING THE EIGHTH-POLE, THE INCIDENT WAS NOT
ENOUGH TO COST CRY ME A RUNNER THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF
FINISH.

Footnotes
CRAZY DREAMS showed early speed and raced close to the early pace, prompted the decent fractions through the backstretch run, confronted the
pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, battled with BLACK CASPIAN then assumed command nearing the furlong pole, felt late pressure from LAMMAS
and determinedly dug in under firm handling to prevail. LAMMAS (GB) tracked the decent early fractions while well placed, maintained position to the
half-mile marker, advanced three wide on the far turn, closed to come within aim in mid-stretch, battled with CRAZY DREAMS inside of the furlong marker
but could not get by the determined winner in the final strides and was second best. HARMON allowed to settle, saved ground to the quarter marker, was
not able to impact the top two in deep stretch but finished well in the final stages and won the nod for show. AMERICAN FARMER unhurried in the early
going, gained ground along the backstretch run, advanced three wide on the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked the needed late response, while
just missing for third. BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) asked to show early speed and established the advantage heading to the first turn, dictated terms through the
backstretch run while prompted by CRAZY DREAMS, held that foe at bay to the quarter marker, battled with CRAZY DREAMS in upper stretch then was
overtaken nearing the furlong pole and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
COUNT ASHER crowded at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the pace to the turn while not far back, slipped to the inside nearing the quarter
marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, mounted a bold late rally along the rail, shifted out in deep stretch to confront GALLAND DE BESOS and won the nod on
the wire in the final strides. GALLAND DE BESOS hard sent to establish the early lead, set decent fractions to the turn, extended the lead nearing the
quarter marker, drew clear to mid-stretch, was all out in deep stretch and was nailed in the final strides by COUNT ASHER for the win, while just holding for
place in a blanket finish. KERRY GOLD chased the early pace, raced two wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed well in the final
stages and just missed for the win and place, while just holding for show. IDIOT'S GOLD chased the decent early fractions while outside of rivals, advanced
four wide on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, finished well in deep stretch and just missed for third. CARDIFF CRACK lunged at the start and was off
slowly, was unhurried through the turn, was not able to impact the leaders in deep stretch but did show good late interest. WAY TOO HOT broke out a bit to
crowd COUNT ASHER at the start, showed early speed and raced close to the early pace, lost ground three wide on the turn and gave way in the drive.
STOUT bobbled at the start, was green in the early stages, lacked speed through the run and was not a factor.

MY SUNSHINE raced closest to the loose pacesetter in the early stages, rallied three wide into the stretch, collared DIAMOND BLITZ and took command
nearing the furlong pole, responded to steady urging in the drive, was fully extended in the final sixteenth and held on over the oncoming runner-up to
prevail. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) crowded at the start and was off a step slowly, was unhurried through the early stages, swung widest into the drive, closed
fast in deep stretch, came within aim of MY SUNSHINE inside of the sixteenth-marker and just missed for the win, while well clear of the rest for place.
DEALERS HAND allowed to settle, raced four wide into the stretch run, vied at the furlong marker, was outfinished by the top two in deep stretch and just
held for third. POUR ON THE COLE took back off of the fast early pace, saved ground to the top of the lane, vied in mid-stretch, could not keep pace with
the top pair in the final stages and just missed for third. DIAMOND BLITZ sent from the break and dictated terms to the first turn, showed good early speed
and raced to a long lead along the backstretch run, came back to the field on the far turn, was overhauled in upper stretch and stopped nearing the furlong
marker.

HANS GRUBER was content to trail in the early stages, improved position along the backstretch run, was well placed into the far turn while trailing, circled
seven wide into the stretch run, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed fast in the late stages, came within aim of SUGAR BEETS nearing the sixteenth-marker
and made a last surge in the final strides to prevail. SUGAR BEETS allowed to settle in the early going, advanced along the backstretch run and was well
placed into the far turn, raced between rivals to the quarter marker, came in tight nearing the top of the lane, battled with GABBY HAYES to mid-stretch,
took command nearing the sixteenth-marker, was all out to hold off HANS GRUBER in the final stages and was tagged for the win, while besting the rest.
SPEED GRAZY took up off of heels leaving the start, was unhurried in the early going, advanced on the second turn while saving ground, came in tight
nearing the quarter marker, found room and advanced nearing the furlong pole, was blocked behind horses nearing the sixteenth-marker, was outfinished
by the top pair in the final stages and was up for show in the final strides. GABBY HAYES showed early speed and assumed command into the first turn, set
solid fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, dug in and held foes at bay to mid-stretch,
weakened in the final stages and was just edged for the show. HEAT N REHEAT allowed to settle in the early going, advanced three wide on the far turn,
lost ground in upper stretch, made a mild late bid but lacked the needed late response. AUSPICIOUS STYLE hopped at the start and was away a bit slowly,
showed early speed and stalked the solid early pace on the first turn, tracked the pace through the backstretch run, advanced while outside of rivals on the
far turn, swung six wide for the drive and did not produce a late rally. NIGHT PROOF rated just off of the solid early pace, advanced along the backstretch
run, came in tight nearing the top of the lane, advanced along the rail in upper stretch, vied for the lead at the furlong pole, could not sustain that run in the
late stages and weakened. ROISTER hustled leaving the break, stalked the solid fractions through the backstretch run, confronted the pacesetter nearing
the quarter marker, could not sustain that run in the drive and tired in the final stages.

SMOKIN HOT BOBBIE showed good speed leaving the break and contested the fast early fractions with SUPERSONIC FLYER, shook free of that rival and
extended the lead nearing the quarter marker, drew to a clear lead in mid-stretch and kept to task in the late stages to prevail. DANIELA BELLA broke in at
the start and bothered NAN ELIZABETH at the break, chased the fast early pace, raced two wide to the quarter marker, angled four wide for the drive, ran
evenly to the furlong grounds, closed with a rush in deep stretch, could not reel in the winner in the final stages but outfinished ALL and secured the place.
ALL content to track from the second flight in the early going, advanced from the rail on the turn, chased SMOKIN HOT BOBBIE into upper stretch, was not
able to make significant headway on that rival in the drive, was outkicked in the final furlong and was outfinished for place, while holding safely in the end for
show. RUNNING LUCK took back off of the fast early pace, saved ground to the quarter marker, advanced nearing mid-stretch and found her best stride
late. ROLINGA chased the fast early fractions, raced two wide on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not offer a late rally. NAN ELIZABETH was
bothered at the start by DANIELA BELLA then clipped heels with that rival and was away slowly, trailed to the turn, raced three wide to the quarter marker,
swung five wide for the drive and improved position late but was unable to threaten. SUPERSONIC FLYER broke alertly, engaged with SMOKIN HOT
BOBBIE in the early stages and pressed that foe through fast early fractions, kept close attendance to the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch
and tired in the late stages. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS
RULED THAT DANIELA BELLA IMPEDED NAN ELIZABETH AT THE START BY DRIFTING INTO THAT RIVAL'S PATH AND IN DOING SO COST NAN
ELIZABETH THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING. DANIELA BELLA WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED SIXTH.

HOW ABOUT A FRESCA unhurried in the early stages, raced two wide on the turn, swung four wide for the drive, closed with a rush while on the left lead
inside of the furlong marker, came within aim in deep stretch and kept to task to nail DANZIGS STAR STORM on the line for the win. DANZIGS STAR
STORM chased the fast early pace, advanced while well placed nearing the quarter marker, continued to gain ground nearing mid-stretch, came within aim
of SHE'S SO FANCY inside of the sixteenth-marker, took command from that rival in deep stretch and was nailed on the line by HOW ABOUT A FRESCA,
while holding safely in the end for place. LOVE LOST took back off of the fast early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, carried out DUST MAKER
midway through the turn, made a steady bid to mid-stretch, finished well in the final furlong and was up for show in the final strides. SHE'S SO FANCY
broke alertly, ceded the early lead to PRETTY THIRSTY and stalked that rival to the turn, advanced to press the quick pace to the quarter marker, battled
with PRETTY THIRSTY to mid-stretch and took a narrow lead into the final furlong, could not hold off oncoming rivals in deep stretch and was just edged for
show in the final strides. MY YAMMY LADY was pinballed at the start and was away slowly, trailed to the turn, raced two then three wide nearing the top of
the lane, was not able to impact the leaders in deep stretch but finished with good late interest. DUST MAKER lacked speed in the early going, raced
outside of rivals on the turn, was carried out a path nearing the quarter marker, came five wide into the drive and found her best stride late. JERSEY BIRD
chased the leading pair through fast fractions in the early going, advanced from the rail on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not offer a late
response. PRETTY THIRSTY was asked to show speed and assumed command in the early going, set fast fractions to the turn, was pressed to the quarter
marker, battled with SHE'S SO FANCY to mid-stretch and faded in the final stages. DANIELLE'S SECRET forwardly placed in the opening stages, was
outrun to the turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker, went evenly to mid-stretch and tired in the final furlong. PANDEMIC GIRL chased the fast early
pace from the second flight, lost position while saving ground on the turn and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
ASCENDANCY broke out a bit at the start, lagged near the back of the field for the first half mile, saving ground all the way, made up several lengths
through the turn without much encouragement from the rider, split horses in mid-stretch then surged to the front under strong handling and won by a
comfortable margin in the end. NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) broke out after the break bothering HARDLY MISCHIEVOUS, raced in mid-pack through the first
half mile, launched a bid on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch and rallied strongly while unable to collar the winner. WORK TO LIVE tracked
behind the leading pair to the far turn, moved to challenge for the lead approaching the quarter pole, ran on well down the lane but was unable to summon
another gear when needed and was outfinished by the top pair while holding third. WORTHY OF MAGIC broke outward at the break, quickly corrected and
was sent for the early lead, was left alone to set the pace, led the field to the quarter pole setting solid fractions along the way, fended off some early
challengers at the top of the stretch but tired with a furlong to run. BANDEENA was racing with the trailing pack early, fell back to last near the three furlong
marker, saved ground through the far turn and managed to muster a mild late rally to gain a few places down the stretch. HARDLY MISCHIEVOUS
squeezed back at the start when NAUGHTY NADINE came into her path after the start, was last into the first turn and content to trail the field in the early
stages, made a sustained run through the far turn while four wide, and made up some ground in the stretch but was much too late. ANGEL'S ADVOCATE
broke sharply, gained the rail and good position going into the first turn, was always prominent, made a bid to challenge the leader turning for home but
could not find another gear and stopped in mid-stretch. SHEZARUNAWAY was outrun early and content to race near the rear of the field early, commenced
a tepid rally from the three furlong pole but finished somewhat one-paced and was unable to make any progress down the stretch. BELLEO'S FOREST
chased just behind the early leaders while three or four wide through the first turn, continued to race wide down the backstretch and through the far turn,
began to lose ground with about three furlongs to run and was not persevered with late.
