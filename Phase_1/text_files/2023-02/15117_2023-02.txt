WOODS HOLE pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, took over while racing in the two and three path around the turn and kicked clear in the
stretch. WHISKARITA tracked the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued around the bend in the three path and chased on
to the wire. CSILLA led the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn, gave way entering the stretch and finished
evenly. MONIQUES DAREDEVIL raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, navigated the turn from the two path and showed no kick. DIXIELAND
DANCER trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and never threatened. LETS TAKE IT IZZY chased the leaders between horses
through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the two path and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
TIZ HERSELF raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged heading into the second bend,
took over while racing in the two and three path from there and drew off commandingly in the stretch. PRETTY RACHEL chased the leader on the inside
around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path and could not go with the winner in the lane but kept on to the
wire. LIZZ A BEE raced in the two path around the first bend, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, moved up while racing in the
three path around the far turn and finished evenly. PURE ELEGANCE saved ground early, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside,
continued around the far turn in the two path and made no bid. EXPECT TO BE READY saved ground around the first turn, led the field on the inside up the
backstretch, dropped back from the rail coming around the second bend and tired further in the lane.

Footnotes
CATCHING FISH dueled on the outside up the backstretch, took over the lead from the three path coming around the turn and dug in gamely in late stretch
to just hold the win. ASK FOR BODE stalked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the bend and
dueled to the wire to just miss. CALL BROS chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and was
outkicked in the lane. LOUD N PROUD tracked the leaders on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and faded in
the stretch. LUCKY LOVER BOY dueled on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back while racing in the two path around the turn and continued to tire
from there. SHAKEM N BREAKEM brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, navigated the
bend from the three path and made no bid. COLONIST veered in and bumped the gate and then the horse to his outside at the start, trailed the field from
the rail early, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
GALLEY HEAD saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, challenged from the rail coming around the second
bend, kicked clear in the stretch and held that margin to the wire while drifting late. SILVER SPRINTER raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off
the pace between horses for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late.
EXAGGERATED HUMOR saved ground early, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, launched a bid from the two path
coming around the far turn and kept on in the lane. GINGER SPARKLE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile,
navigated the far bend from the five and six path and finished evenly. CASTLE BORN raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the pace setter on
the outside up the backstretch, came around the second turn in the four and five path and weakened in the stretch. GILDED CHARMROSE led the way from
the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and tired from there. MISS
INEZ blew the first turn headed into the backstretch, pulled up and walked off.

SILVER PEAK led the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to show the way around the second bend and held
clear to the wire. LIFE AT SEA saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far bend from the two
path and continued pursuit of the winner in the stretch, but could not get by that rival and had to settle for second best. OH CHIC saved ground around the
first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and kept on to the finish,
no match for the top two. STORM BRAVE raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, moved up coming around the far turn, entered
the stretch six wide and continued to gain ground in the lane. AWESOME HONOR hopped up leaving the gate, raced in the four path early, continued up
the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses, navigated the far bend from the two path and finished evenly. DREAMING OF TOGA saved
ground around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the second bend in the three path and faded in the lane.
ANTONOV raced in the three path early, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the
five path and weakened in the stretch. MO TOWN BLUES raced off the pace on the inside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the
three path and was empty in the lane. FANCY DRESS hopped up leaving the gate, veered in in the opening strides, raced in the four path around the first
turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, came around the far bend still in the four path and flattened out from there.

Footnotes
PACIFIC PRINCESS saved ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the second bend, kicked
clear in the stretch and held that margin while drifting out late. UP HER SLEEVE raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leaders between
horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the second bend and continued to chase the winner home. SLIME QUEEN raced in the middle of the pack
on the outside through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late.
MAKE NO MISTAKE raced in the three path early, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming around the
second bend, could not go with the winner in the lane and kept on from there. COOL FRONT raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the
middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and finished evenly. LEA RO saved ground around the
first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, navigated the far bend from the four path and weakened in the lane. SWEET
MOOCHIE raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the two path and never threatened.
ANTALYA raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, moved up while racing in the five path
around the second turn and flattened out in the lane. IRAZU raced in the three path early, trailed the field up the backstretch, swung out to the six path for
the run around the far turn and made no bid. TWISTED TREASURE raced in the three path around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch,
continued to battle from the two path around the far turn and tired in the stretch.
