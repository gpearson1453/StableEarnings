Footnotes
GOLDEN HALO pressed the pace from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the seven-sixteenths marker, opened a clear lead into the stretch
and held off the closing SHE SAID MY WAY to prevail. SHE SAID MY WAY lagged early, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and
finished with good energy to gain the place. BELLE MY BELLE was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn, reached a contending position but
failed to gain late. LEGAL MISCHIEF was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened. MAMALONA was away in good order to
set a pressured pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. SENSUOUS KITTY showed brief speed and weakened.

Footnotes
AWHITESPORTSCOAT was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore in tandem
with CANNONBALL COMIN with a furlong to run, vied with that rival and held late. CANNONBALL COMIN lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the
turn, angled out further into the stretch, reached the lead with the winner, vied with that foe through the vigorous drive and just missed. YOLA settled off the
leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. J T'S A. T. M. broke sharply to duel for the early advantage with DUSALUT
while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. REDACTION was off slow, lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further
in mid-stretch and finished with a belated bid. GOT EVEN SMARTER was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor.
DUSALUT was away alertly to dispute the pace from the inside and gave way after going a half. FOREVER GOLD pressed the pace while racing four-wide,
weakened after going a half and was eased through the lane.

CHROME KING broke in the air, rushed to contend, raced three-wide through the second turn, responded when set down for the drive and was up in the
closing yards. UNCLE JEFF broke sharply to stalk the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, opened a clear margin
into the lane but could not hold the winner safe late. MONGOL ALTAI lagged early, raced six-wide through the second turn and finished with good late
energy. TODAY MATTERS was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn and finished evenly late. IN THE MIDST chased the leaders
while racing four-wide and weakened in the drive. FABSTRACTION sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and weakened through the
final furlong.

not match strides with the winner late. PHOENICIAN MAGIC settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the lane and finished willingly. MISS

Footnotes
UNBROKEN STAR was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole, raced three-wide while while setting
the pace and was ridden out to the wire. FAMOUS ROCK STAR tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, was no match for the
winner in the drive but finished well to hold the place. MARK YE WELL lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid.
UPPER ROOM was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with some late run. VICTORY
BOULEVARD showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a belated bid. BLUE SKYE
JADE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly. AWESOME SATURDAY raced off the pacesetters early, moved
three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. WEAR THE CROWN lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not offer a bid. UNLEASH THE
BEAST sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, weakened after going a half and was eased through the lane.
