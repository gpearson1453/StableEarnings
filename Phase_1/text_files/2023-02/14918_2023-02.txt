margin by the furlong marker, but weakened late and was denied on the wire. SHY DA RUNNER chased the pace on the inside, came two wide into the
lane and angled out in the lane and rallied. ITCHY PALMS was allowed to settle early, came three wide into the lane, angled out by the sixteenth marker
and had a late rally. QUINCY ADAMS was settled back early and was three wide on the turn and had a belated rally. LUCKY LEWIS stumbled at the start,
chased the pace five wide and weakened. DON'T QUESTION ME was fractious in the gate, settled back on the inside and had no rally. BARN SWALLOW

Footnotes
CRUSH IT was well rated early three wide, made a three wide move on the turn and took over leaving the quarter pole, then was clear by the furlong marker
and maintained that margin to the wire under a drive. SPEIGHTSTER RED stalked the pace two wide, made a bid between rivals on the turn to vie for
command, then chased the winner home the final furlong and held on to the place award. MIAMI MUMBLES was allowed to settle early, advanced on the
turn and shifted out and came four wide into the lane and had a mild late rally to miss the place award. JUST NOD AND SMILE was well placed early on the
inside and weakened. TRUE GOLD set a uncontested pace on the inside and gave way on the turn. THE GREAT CASBY was reserved three wide and had
no rally. O K GAME ON was off slowly and saved ground and had no rally.

REAWAKENED set the pacde while racing in the two path, dug in gamely in the stretch and held sway late to prove best under a drive. GREAT BARONESS
stalked the pace three wide and finished willingly but could not get to the winner, second best. HIGHWAY QUEEN was allowed to settle early, saved ground
on the turn and angled out in the lane and had a late rally to gain the show award. FALSE RULING was well placed on the inside and weakened in the drive,
lost show award late. ESTA CHUCK was reserved early and three wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane and had no rally. MISS ALEX broke in at
the start, saved ground on the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
DIXIE CANNONBALL pressed the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn and was clear leaving the turn, then widened the margin by the furlong
marker and then maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove best, driving. GERONIMO was rated along and three wide on the turn, came four wide into
the lane and finished well. FRANCIS X. was reserved early, came three wide into the lane and had a mild late rally. COMMUNICATION FAIL was off a step
slow, far back early, five wide by the quarter pole and swung out wide leaving the turn and rallied late. SUMMER ASH was off slowly, reserved and
advanced four wide on the turn but had no late kick. SCYNTZ was allowed to settle early and was two wide on the turn and lacked a late response. I'M NOT
SLOW failed to menace. SHARDIAL set a pressured pace on the inside and stopped in the lane, eased late and walked off. BUMBLE MONSTER chased
the pace on the inside and stopped, pulled up at the furlong marker and walked off.

Footnotes
ALL TIME CLASSIC pulled early behind the front runners, worked way to the inside entering the turn, came out slightly leaving the three eighths, was two
wide by the quarter pole, then dropped down leaving the turn and made a bid up the inside and went on even terms by the furlong marker and edged clear
to prove best under a drive. ASK THE UMPIRE set a pressured pace on the inside, then was headed by the quarter pole, turned back that bid and came two
wide off the turn, then was headed again by the sixteenth marker and could not go with the winner late, second best. SIR STEELE was off slowly, raced four
wide on the turn and was along for the show award. CUP MATCH stalked the pace and made a three wide bid to vie for command by the quarter pole but
weakened. MISTER ARANGUIZ was allowed to settle on the inside and failed to menace. COMMANDING pressed the pace between rivals by the half mile
marker, then checked leaving the three eighths marker and weakened. FINNOGGINDUDE stopped. The rider on COMMANDING claimed foul against the
winner for interference leaving the three eighths marker, after the STEWARDS reviewed the replays the OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED and the race left
as is.
