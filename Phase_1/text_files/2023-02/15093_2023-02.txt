Footnotes
JACKS SISTER JILL contested the pace from the start, dueled at even terms two deep on the turn and dug in determinedly to clear Witness The Energy in
later yards. CEDAR'S WISH broke a step slow, gave chase through the backstretch and raced near the rail on the turn, angled out into the stretch and dug
in to take second the final strides. WITNESS THE ENERGY contested the pace from the start and dueled at even terms nearest the rail on the turn, loomed
a close factor through the upper stretch but relented later yards. RIVER REWARDS RVF chased the early pace outside, angled to the inside midway on the
turn, left the turn at the rail and ran evenly down the lane. SIENTE LA BRISA gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the five path and
finished evenly outside. SISTER JOANN gave chase then flattened while losing ground on the turn.

Footnotes
SO COURAGEOUS set a pressured early pace then dueled at even terms from the three eighths pole, contested the turn two deep and dug in determinedly
to inch clear of the game challenge of FROGGY THE GREMLIN in the final yards. The latter dueled at even terms from the three eighths pole, raced at the
rail on the far turn and dug in gamely to deep stretch before reluctantly ceding the final yards. DOC ELM gave chase, rounded the turn in the three path then
dueled through the stretch for third. ROLL DEM BONES chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for third.
FEARNOUGHT chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn at the rail, eased out leaving the turn and ran evenly in the lane. CHARITABLY GIFTED
engaged in close early chase, raced in the four path of the turn then flattened inside the eighth pole.

Footnotes
LOOKA LOOKA ducked out and made contact with Wesright leaving the gate, went right to the lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure near
the three eighths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly to hold off the challenge of MALIBU ROCK STAR through the
stretch. The latter rated close inside, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced at near even terms in the three path of the far turn and dueled
gamely to the wire. ONLY GET'N BETTER saved ground well back from early contention, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and
rounded the far turn about the four path, left the turn outside and finished evenly for third. CHROME HEIR rounded the first turn in the five path, picked up
the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn, was eased out leaving the turn and passed rivals. TAKE AIM rounded the
first turn in the three and four paths, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened. UNKNOWN AGENDA raced
two deep on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. BODYSLAM stalked from the three and four
paths, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn then flattened stride. WESRIGHT was bumped at the break then
stalked two deep, challenged toward the three eighths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn. SHADE TREE CORNER became a bit anxious in the gate
then saved ground. TACOMA AUSTIN raced well off the pace in the three path, left the first turn outside and gave chase from the seven sixteenths, but
weakened in the five path of the far turn.

RAISE A SPEIGHTS moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and
was kept alert in the lane. MARK DID IT raced off the early pace in the three and four paths and stalked from the seven eighths pole, gave chase nearing
the seven sixteenths, rounded the far turn off the rail then dueled through the stretch for second. LATE IN THE GAME settled in the four path the first turn
and stalked into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and was outfinished in the stretch
duel for second. RIDICULOUS raced off the pace and off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn two deep then
flattened in the lane. WITH SECRET ENERGY saved ground close to the pace, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far
