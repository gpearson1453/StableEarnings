WHATS UP SWEETS split horses in the first turn to comfortably take control by the six furlong pole. showed the way while setting reasonable fractions and
was uncontested, saved ground through out, was kept to task late and finished willing. IZEONPOINT broke a step slow but was unhurried early, raced far off
the pace, started to build momentum along the backside, stayed outside and continued to pass horses, went into the turn racing on the outside continued to
gain momentum, at the quarter pole was still wide in the lane, caught two other foes and passed them by the eighth pole and finally switched leads, was
driven and kept to task but couldn't get to the leader. Was second best today. QUINN MURPHY was far back early saved ground from the rail, passed tired
rivals in the stretch. MARY JACK broke outwardly slightly brushing an outside rival, moved four wide into the first turn, settled behind the leader from the rail,
chased, tired in the lane. GLANCE saved ground, off pace, mild bid, no rally. HAVINFUNYET failed to menace.

SUMMER LOVER vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals entering the backstretch, chased an outer rival around the far turn, rebid in upper stretch, gained
an advantage at the furlong pole, and drove clear. SAILOR'S RETURN laid off of the pace along the inside into the first turn, shifted out and tugged forward
to press the top pair entering the backstretch, vied before gaining command and tucking to the two path entering the far turn, showed the way from an inner
presser around that bend, dueled with that one through upper stretch, but was headed at the furlong pole, and proved second best. ASTERN BANKER
broke outwardly, lacked speed in the three path, chased the top pair from within striking range around the far turn, but failed to change leads in upper
stretch, and tired. SPINSTRAWINTO GOLD broke half a beat slow, vied for the lead two wide and between horses leaving the first turn, but gave way
passing the half mile pole, weakened around the far turn, was eased up in upper stretch, then received assistance from the outrider to return to his
connections and walk off.

WICKED ROSE was off a bit slow allowed to settle while racing from the rear of the field along the rail, trailed until the quarter pole, made a late run, passed
several but at the eighth pole still had three more to over come, was kept too task and driven and passed two more, and finally caught the leader with no
time top spare was up for the win all while in the four path. DRILLING REPORT was wide into the first turn settled into the second tier along the backside,
matched strides with the leader around the half mile pole, continued to battle out of the turn and into the stretch, shook that competitor at the three sixteenth
pole, looked like the winner but was caught late. DREWHUSTLE was strong for the first half mile of the race while being rated, was pressured around the
half mile marker by an outer foe, matched strides through the turn and into the lane and gave way at the three sixteenth pole. BIND FAITH was off slow, was
allowed to settle going into the first turn, started to slowly gain ground from the outside and was in contention at the three eighths pole, gave a game effort
early in the stretch but flattened out late. OAK HILL SOLUTION vied for the lead early finally settled for mid pack at the six furlong pole, traveled along the
rail with horses on the out side of him, shuffled back at the three eighths pole and started a steady retreat but was able to pass a tired rival in the lane. PLAY
MO was aloud to find his stride early along the rail, shifted out into the three path at the five furlong pole, moved up in between rivals after the half, was
asked for more run and did so willingly into the turn from the inside, was still giving good effort out of the turn but faded by the eighth pole.

Footnotes
STRUMMER laid off of the pace in the six path into the first turn, tucked down to the four path in the early stages of that bend, came under a firm hold
behind rivals down the backstretch, shifted back outside of foes nearing the far turn, gained six wide around that bend, took aim on the clear leader while
shifting inwardly through upper stretch, brushed an inner counterpart approaching midstretch, sustained a bid at the sixteenth pole, and forged an
advantage late. FOR REAL ALICE pressed outside of the leader and from the three path, vied with a half mile remaining, led narrowly from her inner
counterpart in the two path around the far turn, drew clear entering the lane, maintained a clear margin well into the final furlong, but was caught in the final
sixteenth, and saved place. HEART THAT BINDS laid off of the pace in the five path, inched closer along with an outer rival around the far turn, took
brushes from that foe while being forced down a path in upper stretch, kept on while getting outkicked by that foe in the final furlong, and just missed
reaching place. MY LITTLE JEN tracked along the inside, vacated the rail into the far turn, searched for racing room in the two to three paths while pocketed
among rivals turning for home, but yielded back from crowded quarters entering the lane, and kept on mildly thereafter. POINT OF VICTORY trailed two
wide, lagged behind around the far turn, cut the gap entering the lane, swung six wide in upper stretch, and moved up on her left lead. STORIED TRIP
saved ground far back, encountered traffic turning for home, then lacked a bid. LAKE RUNNER required subtle correction from the assistant starter in the
gate to become set for the start, showed the way while remaining a bit off of the rail around the first turn, got headed by an outer presser at the half mile
pole, sustained pressure around the far turn, but gave way nearing the lane. EXPLOSIVELY HOT stalked two wide, then from between horses down the
backstretch, chased four wide while among rivals around the far turn, and gave way turning for home.

Footnotes
NOSILVERSPOONSHERE tracked along the inside, ranged up outside of the leader approaching the far turn, vied around that bend, led while well in hand
turning for home, and drew off with much more to give. SHE'S GONE D'WILD set the pace along the inside, met the eventual winner's bid nearing the far
turn, vied around that bend, but proved no match nearing the lane, and held place. SPECIAL CONNECTION saved ground far back gained show from outer
rivals around the far turn, and chased place home. SHELLI'S ANGEL laid off of the pace in the three path, saved ground around the far turn, shifted out to
the four path while improving inside of rivals entering the lane, and failed to menace thereafter. VIOLA STAR was slow into stride after breaking a step
behind the rest, trailed in the three to four paths around the turns, and made little impact. SPELLBINDING prompted the pace four wide, tucked three wide
down the backstretch, but failed to keep pace with the top two entering the far turn, and faded between horses around that bend. MISS KENNEDY raced
forwardly two wide and between horses, chased down the backstretch, and faded in the four path around the far turn.

GRACELEADSUSHOME pressed the leader from the three path, vied around the far turn, dueled in the four path through the lane, and edged away late.
CLASSICAL MAGNOLIA set the pace inside of a pressing rival while a bit off of the rail, gamely sparred with that foe through the lane, but was bested.
LEAD ME laid off of the pace three wide, pursued in the five path around the far turn, then chased in the eight path through the lane while one-paced.
TWIRLING CAT hopped slightly at the start, tracked three wide, ranged up outside of the top pair and in the four path turning for home, but failed to keep
pace with those foes while floating to the six path entering the lane, and chased between rivals while hanging on her left lead. STAR MOMENT stalked
along the inside, then from the two path around the far turn, and only managed to chase the leaders through the lane. MS. CAJUN QUEEN saved ground
towards the rear, but to no avail. DEROUTANTE rated at the rear two wide, and never got involved. TARGET VISION tracked in midpack in the two path,
but steadied while under a firm hold behind foes around the first turn, failed to sustain midpack position approaching the far turn, and faded thereafter.

RUMBLE READY was last away, recovered to stalk two wide and between horses, bid in the three path entering the turn, vied around the bend, led turning
for home, and drew off under driving pressure. KISLOVODSK trailed, shifted out to the four path around the turn, fanned six wide entering the lane, and
rallied outside of foes to gain place at the sixteenth pole. JUSTFORSPEIGHTOFIT raced forwardly outside of the top pair and from the four path around the
turn, chased while failing to keep pace with the clearing leader in upper stretch, bid for place along with an outer rival at the sixteenth pole, but got
outkicked. BOXSTER raced forwardly along the inside, stalked the leaders from the two path while under mild coaxing around the turn, gained place from an
inner rival at the three sixteenths pole after the leader kicked clear, but tired in the final furlong. KNOT THE ONE bumped an inner rival early on, pursued
from midpack in the five path around the turn, and tired. ROCK WITH YOU set the pace, vied inside of the eventual winner around the turn, got headed
approaching the five sixteenths pole, and weakened in upper stretch. GOLDEN FLASH took a bump from an inner rival at the start, then received contact
from an outer rival in the early stages forcing him to again bump his inner counterpart in the process, then steadied in crowded quarters at the five furlong
pole, laid off of the pace in the three path around the turn, and made little impact. I'M YOUR CAPTAIN bumped an outer rival at the start before being
bumped by that foe in the early stages, laid off of the pace in the two path around the turn, and faded.

find in upper stretch, shifted four wide in the final furlong, and stayed on to reach place at the wire. MACHINE GUN MAN prompted the pace two wide and
between horses, vied around the turn, dueled with a narrow advantage in the final furlong, but was outkicked by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole, then
was caught at the wire for place. MONEY RUN set the pace along the inside, sparred with a pair of outer foes around the turn, sustained the battle through
upper stretch, but yielded in the final sixteenth. ZAICI brushed the outer half of the gate upon leaving it, prompted the pace three wide, vied around the turn,
dueled through upper stretch, but faltered between horses approaching the sixteenth pole. BIG BEEMSTER saved ground off of the pace, shifted outwardly
in upper stretch, and stayed on to narrow the gap late. TIZ THE BIG ONE chased the leading trio from the two path into the turn, shifted to the four path
