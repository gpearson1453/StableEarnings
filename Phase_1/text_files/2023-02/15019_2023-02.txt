Footnotes
ELLIES AT WINDSOR took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the
rail and was steadily handled in the lane. ODINA rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn
and settled for second best. ISLE BE THERE was bumped leaving the gate and raced well back inside on the first turn, eased out leaving the turn, bid
toward the three eighths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn and came along for third inside the sixteenth pole. AFLEET PENGUIN lost ground into the
first turn and rounded the turn about the four path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn then flattened in
the lane. AWESOME MOON stalked the early pace three wide, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then weakened
into the lane. GOLDEN SALLY ducked out and made contact with Isle Be There leaving the gate, was forced to the five path on the first turn and left the turn
outside, bid approaching the three eighths pole but flattened in the three path of the far turn. ONLY ROMANCE stalked the early pace two deep, gave chase

Footnotes
DULCIMER DAME took the lead and moved to the inside to rate the pace, was given rein to keep ahead of VOLNAY leaving the three eighths pole, raced
clear of that one midway on the far turn then kept alert through the lane. The latter tapered in and raced with the pace two deep, dueled from the three
eighths pole but dropped back off the rail midway on the far turn, was steadily handled leaving the turn and held on for second. DIVINE FASHION rounded
the opening turn in the five path, gave chase into the backstretch and raced near the rail on the far turn, then outfinished in the stretch duel for second.
SHERIFF'S KID saved ground just off the early pace, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three and four
paths then flattened in the lane. SWEET ANNABELLA rounded the opening turn about the four path, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced
off the rail on the far turn and weakened in the stretch. MINER'S GEM stumbled to her nose leaving the gate and dropped well back to save ground.

Footnotes
I B NASTY saved ground well off the early pace, started a bid leaving the half mile pole and circled rivals in the six path of the far turn, dug in for the lead
mid-stretch and determinedly eked out the advantage over the stretch challenge of LADY WHISTLEDOWN, who exchanged contact with Brandyurafinegirl
leaving the gate and rounded the opening turn in the four path, contested even terms in the three path on the far turn but was outfinished in the duel through
the stretch. IRISH SAMURAI raced outside early then angled in on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in
the three path and relented in the duel through the stretch. SUPERSNAKE rated close off the rail on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn and remained a factor to late stretch before flattening stride. ULTIMATE BREEZE
rounded the opening turn in the five path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced close four wide on the far turn, but flattened inside the eighth pole.
PRETTY SPECTACULAR took the early lead at the rail into the first turn, was met at the nine sixteenths pole and gave chase into the backstretch, rounded
the far turn near the rail and showed little more. MAYSVILLE MISS raced with the early pace in the three path, took the lead at the nine sixteenths pole and
rated on the front end from that point, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn but was met toward mid-stretch and weakened. BRANDYURAFINEGIRL
exchanged contact with Lady Whistledown leaving the gate and raced off the rail on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened
off the rail on the far turn.

COMPANY CLOWN chased through the backstretch and raced close in the three path of the turn, drifted leaving the turn but dug in determinedly to take
over past the sixteenth pole and held off the game challenge of KUKULKAN, who gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn, eased out leaving the turn
and dueled gamely to the finish. GOLDEN G gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three and four paths then dueled through the
stretch for third. E J'S REVENGE chased outside, rounded the turn about the six path then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. NITRO TIME came away
sharply and set a pressured pace, rounded the turn at the rail, was met mid-stretch and relented later yards. RULING chased through the backstretch, raced
off the rail on the turn and flattened from mid-stretch. BLACK CANDY saved ground in an even effort.

Footnotes
ALL THE WAY MAE dropped well back from early contention, started a long steady bid leaving the three eighths pole and circled rivals in the four path of
the far turn, took the lead mid-stretch and drew off the final sixteenth. CAN'T FIGURE saved ground on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole
and took aim in the three path of the far turn then dueled through the stretch for second. KERFORD'S COMMISH raced in the four path the first turn then
stalked into the backstretch, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead at the three eighths, rounded the far turn off the rail, drifted leaving
the turn, was caught mid-stretch and flattened stride. UNBRIDLED IRISH became a bit edgy in the gate then took the lead nearing the three quarter pole,
was met at the seven sixteenths, gave chase leaving the three eighths, but dropped back approaching the quarter pole and weakened. MO STYLISH rated
close inside on the opening turn then faded through the backstretch. I'M SO EXTRA settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven
sixteenths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. SUNSET QUEEN saved ground on the first turn then eased out with a bid into the backstretch and
showed little response.

IMPROBABLE STORY rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn and
was steadily handled to widen. JAMMIN JIMTOWN rated close inside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, eased
outward toward the head of the lane and dueled through the stretch for second. SHANGHAI CANDY saved ground early and settled off the pace, picked up
the chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. ALBERTANO rounded the first turn
about the four path then saved some ground into the second turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and finished evenly
to improve his position. GOLDEN APPEAL stalked the earlier pace from the three path, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn in the
four and five paths and flattened late yards. HONOR THE FLEET raced off the pace about the four path, drew close into the backstretch and challenged at

Footnotes
TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY tapered in to take the lead nearing the three quarter pole and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths,
contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, drew clear past the eighth pole and held well under steady handling. MARKETABILITY raced well off the
early pace toward the inside then eased out with a bid into the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, dug in leaving the turn, came between
horses mid-stretch and dueled through the final sixteenth for second. CHINA CAT rounded the opening turn in the four path, bid leaving the three eighths
pole and contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn then dueled through the stretch for third while outfinished for second. CLEARLY
VISIBLE saved ground on the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced close near the rail on the far turn
then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. RAVENEL raced well back inside on the first turn then angled out with a bid into the backstretch, rounded the far
turn in the four and five paths and ran evenly down the lane. TORCH CARRIER saved ground into the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced
near the rail on the far turn, then flattened in the lane. LIGHTFOOT MISS settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and passed rivals. TEMPORARILY saved ground into the first turn, gave chase from the three
eighths pole, steadied at the rail approaching the quarter pole, though came back to finish evenly. SOCIAL EXCLUSION rated close in the two and three
paths on the opening turn, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn. LADY KAZA rated close off the rail on the first
turn, gave chase toward the three eighths pole but gave way approaching the five sixteenths.
