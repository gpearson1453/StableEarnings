Footnotes
TEMPLEMAN ALLEY chased the early pace from the inside, moved up three to four wide in the stretch run and got up late under strong handling. THE
EQUINEST stalked the pace, moved up five wide into the upper stretch, had a clear lead near the sixteenth pole but couldn't hold off the winner late in a
game effort. OLD FORTY FIVE raced mid pack early on, altered course near the three sixteenths pole, raced three to wide in the drive and finished willingly
to the wire. COAL TOWN ROAD showed good early foot to set the early pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile. BAYOU SHACK pressed the pace
from the inside and gave way. MR. LUCKY dropped back early, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor. BALI BEACH failed to
respond.

ROSE RING pressed the early leader from the outside, engaged in a long drive and just got up under strong handling. CHARGAREE vied for the early lead
from the inside, dug in and just missed in a game effort. TURN TO ME SUCREE stalked the top pair, raced near the inside past the quarter pole, angled out
and raced even with no closing run on the top pair. CASCABRIA dropped back early, raced three to four wide around the far turn and never was a factor.
ROMANTIC JEWEL was forwardly placed early on and failed to sustain a bid.

PRIVATE DRIVE pressed the pace from three deep while racing from the outside of rivals and finished well to get up under all out pressure. KISSINGER
was off slowly, made an advance through the far turn, raced two wide near the quarter pole, angled seven wide into the upper stretch and closed in well late.
CLASSIC MO dueled along the rail down the backstretch through the far turn and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. OAKEN was off the early going,
asked through the far turn, fanned wide into the lane and made a good late gain to moved up. SHOW SLIDING HOME dropped back early on, raced four to
five wide around the far turn and had no late rally. THIS MAN CAN dueled from the outside of rival in the two path and gave way. This Man Can fell soon
after the wire and walked off the track under her own power. KID RUSSELL raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had no
response.

stretch run, surged late and just got up under strong handling. DEBDURITE lunged at the break, forced a bit wide to race five deep into the first turn, made a
three wide bid to take over near the three eighths pole, was clear near the sixteenth pole and was caught on the wire in a game effort. GOTSOMEMOJO
was slow early on, moved up through the far turn, fanned wide into the upper stretch and rallied strongly late to close in on the top pair. KING ANDRES
stalked the pace, raced four to three wide and weakened in the drive. SAY HEY KID dropped back early off the early pace, raced six deep near the three
sixteenths pole and had no late rally. AREYOUTALKINGTOME raced with the second flight early on, was four deep near the quarter pole and had no
response. GET HAMMERED settled off the early going, raced three to four wide through the far turn and never threatened. THIRSTY ACTOR pressed the
pace from the inside and fave way. PIONEER DANCER failed to sustain a bid. VALEROSO showed good early foot to set the pace from the outside and
faltered.

was five deep near the three sixteenths pole and had no final bid. HARSH TRUTH was slow early, raced three to two wide in the drive and had not enough.
MAN'S CHOICE stalked the pace from the outside, raced along the inside through the upper stretch and lacked a bid. PAYMASTER GENERAL raced with
the second flight, raced four wide in the stretch run and had no response. BAD BOY BOOGIE sprinted clear and was empty just past the three sixteenths
