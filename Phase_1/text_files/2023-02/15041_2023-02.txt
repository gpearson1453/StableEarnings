Footnotes
SPECIAL PRIDE was void of any early speed, angled out eight wide out of the turn, was closing fast and was up in time for the win. WAY RITE pressed the
early pace, from between rivals, met the bid of RAISE OUT FLAG, dueled with that rival to late stretch, but couldn't hold off the winner. RAISE OUR FLAG
tracked the early pace, loomed six wide through the turn, made a bid, dueled to late stretch and finished a game third. MARILYN MONEYROLL raced in mid
pack early, went three wide into the turn, angled out to the seven path in early stretch, was in tight late and finished evenly. LA DIAMANT was unhurried
early, raced three wide into the turn and offered no late rally. FLOWER POWER set a pressured early pace from off the rail and faded. WILEO PROCEED
broke slow, was rushed to race four wide into the turn and flattened out.

was empty late. GUNNERS ONE was reserved early, advanced eight wide and finished belatedly. STELLARSBLUERIBBON raced in mid pack early, went
six wide into the turn and passed tired rivals. BISCUIT SNATCHER was void of any early speed, raced nine wide and offered no late rally. COLOR ME
GONE was outrun early, went five wide, angled in and was no threat. REAL PENNY was allowed to settle from between rivals and flattened out. SKEETER
