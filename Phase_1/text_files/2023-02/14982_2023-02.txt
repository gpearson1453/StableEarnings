UNSTOPPABLE ME settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and edged away late.
AMADMADWORLD was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached a striking position but failed to gain on the winner
late. DEVIL'S OFF DUTY showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. WESTERN CHARM was away in good
order to duel for the lead while racing three-wide and weakened through the final furlong. ANOTHER WINE broke sharply to dispute the pace with
WESTERN CHARM from the inside and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
LOVELY LOLA sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, increased her margin into the lane and drew off as a handy winner.
GRANDIOSE SUMMER raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached a contending position, angled out further into the stretch, could
not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to be clearly second best. DADDY'SFAVORITESON drifted out soon after the start, raced just off the
leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly. ANGRY EMMY steadied soon after the start, raced six-wide through the turn and did
not threaten. PENNY'S ANNIE chased the leaders while racing five-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. WITCHES DANCE was void of early
speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERNING THE STEADYING OF
ANGRY EMMY AT THE ELEVEN-SIXTEENTHS MARKER AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS CONCLUDED THAT DADDY'SFAVORITESON HAS
DRIFTED OUT TO CAUSE THE INFRACTION AND WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FOURTH.

Footnotes
BIGFOOT CITY sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and held sway to the wire. GIANT
PAYDAY was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive and finished with a steady bid. CASHANOVA was forwardly placed
early, moved five-wide through the second turn and failed to gain in the drive. OF GOOD REPORT was void of early speed, saved ground through the
second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with some late run. HYPERFOCUS was never far back, raced three-wide through the second turn and
weakened in the drive. CLUB MESQUITE lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. BOB'S ALL IN showed no early
speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. THICK HAZE chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going
three furlongs.

Footnotes
IF YOU WANT IT lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled in mid-stretch and was up in the closing yards. CRIMINAL RECORD
was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, gained a brief lead late but could not resist the winner late. INDY'S STAR
settled off the leaders early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the half, opened a clear margin and yielded through the final sixteenth. DADDY'S
GIRL was off slow, lagged early, saved ground through the second turn and finished with a belated bid. FLYING TO THE LINE sprinted clear at once, raced
off the rail while setting the pace and gave way after going five furlongs. FAST TO FORTUNE raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the
second turn and failed to rally. MISS AGGIE BLING chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. TIMES CHANGED UPON
REVIEW.
