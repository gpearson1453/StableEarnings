Footnotes
CANADA'S CUSTOMS closest to the leader off the inside, came three wide for the drive, reached the leader with less than a furlong remaining, floated out
by that one late, up late between rivals in a determined effort. LADY DEMAREE broke alertly, clear in the run up the backstretch, continued to hold daylight
through the turn and upper stretch, drifted out when confronted inside the furlong grounds, could not contain the winner while narrowly holding the second
spot. TALES OF HOME back off the pace off the inside, four wide through most of the turn, drifted a bit nearing midstretch, late push outside, missed
second. OFF RAMP in traffic and then was shuffled back into the turn, three wide, lacked a serious closing response the final furlong. COMEDY ACT last to
leave, moved up inside to a striking position into the turn, continued to save ground into the lane, came up empty in the run to the wire. SILVIA in the two
path behind the pace, failed to muster a closing response as well. SHE'S ALL CLASS broke back, lacked speed off the inside, came four wide for the drive,
remained back in trailing in.

Footnotes
BETCHA broke on top, set the pace along the inside, dueled turn, put that rival away entering the stretch, responded when challenged by a second foe
approaching midstretch, dug in gamely to repel that one in the run to the wire. HOUSE WRECKER within striking distance in the three path, advanced on
the winner when straightened for home, outside bid, dueled to the wire, denied. PUT A BOW ON IT in mid pack early, four wide into the turn when still back,
gradually dropped to the rail through the bend, improved up the inside and was closing the gap on the top two late. SHOW ME GRACE off step slow, moved
up steadily to within striking distance up the backstretch, angled out to be four wide into the stretch, lacked closing bid. PROUD VICTORIA lacked early foot
outside, four wide into the turn, three wide and between foes exiting, improved position slightly without posing a serious threat. C C THE BARTENDER off a
step slow, moved up to race in the main body early, two path through much of the turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response.
CHASING SHADOWS hesitated at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, remained well back the opening quarter, four wide through the turn when
beginning a mild advance, continued to improve position through the stretch. CATECHISM pressed the winner up the backstretch from the outside, dueled
through the turn in the two path then faltered in the drive. FIVE QUEENS came out early, remained always back. STYLIN N PROFILIN in the second flight
for a half while four wide, tired from those early efforts. VISUAL MAGIC trailed throughout while showing little.

Footnotes
BRESLAU moved up the opening furlong to vie for the lead closest to the inside, dueled through the turn and the length of the stretch, held advantage late
over the other speed then gained the nod over the runner up at the wire. NINJA WARRIOR restless in the gate prior to the start, broke with the field, chased
the dueling leaders out of the turn in the three path, lost ground to that pair into the lane, roused for the run to the wire, late surge outside, missed nod. MAC
DADDY TOO moved up with the winner to contest the pace after the start off the inside, remained on equal terms with that rival until very late when caught
for the place. PAPA ROCKET broke back, lacked early foot, improved turn, fell back when straightened for home, then regained a couple of position in the
late going while between horses at the wire. LAKE RADIO lacked speed outside, four wide into the turn, continued outside,, lacked a serious closing
response while remaining widest of the second flight at the wire. BURNINHUNKOFLOVE in mid pack and inside, continued behind the leaders when
straightened for home, came up empty the final furlong. TOTALIZER made little impact three wide. SONO GRATO last away, was always outrun. BANJO
BEAR broke sharp, briefly contested the issue while outside, got out early in the turn, gave way, jogged in well back.

Footnotes
BENNYKAYANDSUZYTOO broke well from along the inside, hustled clear before a quarter, larger advantage into the stretch when off the rail, maintained a
comfortable advantage to the wire under steady handling. SUMMORYA lacked early foot, raced back into the turn, three wide for the drive, rallied to be in
time for the place, no real threat to the winner. GRAMERCY PARK in mid pack while racing outside, three to four wide out of the turn, made a bid for the
place late, outfinished. MOZINGO prompted the winner from the two path into and through the turn, continued to chase upper stretch, weakened late to lose
the runner up position. CHAI TEA last away, lacked speed while four wide through the turn, picked off some tiring rivals to improve position, not enough late
for the place. LASSIE MY GIRL in the second flight behind the winner, weakened through the stretch. SHE'S STORMING was never a threat in the three
path. HAMAZING DEBATE was finished early. TIMBAVATI forwardly placed while three wide, backed up down the lane.

Footnotes
HEROIC MOVE away in good order, settled outside to be four wide onto the backstretch, continued well out in the strip, four wide into the final bend, three
wide when moving on the leader turning for home, outside bid, exchanged brushes, proved best under firm handling. J J'S JOKER broke just behind the
early leader, pressed that one for five furlongs, took over in the three path midway on the final turn, came two wide for the drive, responded when the winner
came alongside soon after, exchanged brushes with that one in the run to the wire, proved stubborn to the end. INTERLOCK EMPIRE devoid of any early
foot, saved ground when beginning to improve second turn, steered out around a tiring rival to split foes inside the furlong grounds, along for the show, no
threat to the top two. MAJOR BLUE off a beat slow, moved up steadily in the run to the first turn inside, remained within striking distance just off the rail for
five furlongs, dropped back to the rail for the second turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing kick. ROUTE RUNNER in mid pack while three
wide and inside the winner, continued in the three path second turn, also went evenly through the lane. SEAS OF NORMANDY off the pace inside, pulled
onto the backstretch, encountered some traffic into the far turn, also managed little in the way of a closing response. JUILLIARD broke on top, set the pace
along the inside, began to weaken when headed by the runner up midway on the final turn. HARD SPUN FANTASY fell back to trail after the start, remained
back throughout in failing to menace. BYE BYE RAY four wide into the first turn when in mid pack, continued outside and was four wide again second turn,
tired. WELLWRIT forwardly placed in the early going, was finished after a half. KUPP off a step slow, three wide first turn, raced four wide into the far turn
when beginning to tire, continued to back up and trailed home well beaten.

AIRTIME broke out, bumped, raced in the second flight early in the two path, raced between horses up the backstretch and into the far turn, moved closer in
traffic while still in the two path late in that bend, dropped inside when straightened for home, got through a narrow opening approaching the furlong marker,
gained the advantage and edged clear under steady handling. SHOPPER'S REVENGE off a step slow, void of speed, swung out five wide when advancing
out of the final turn, challenged a furlong out then hung. WESTERN GHENT back off the pace and the inside, three wide through the final turn when being
asked, mild rally, proved no match for the top two. EASY ACTION pressed the issue three wide, continued to apply pressure through the second turn, had
little left for the drive. GHOST HERO took command after the start, moved off the inside midway on the first turn, continued to set the pace the middle half,
weakened when headed from the inside by winner with just under a furlong remaining. LIL SWEET THANG off a step slow after being pinched and bumped
from both sides, remained well back, steered out widest for the drive, picked off some tiring foes after the issue had been decided. BEN'S LEGACY failed to
menace with a three out to four wide trip. CABALLO FELIZ was finished after a half along the inside. THIRSTY JOHN forwardly placed in the first turn
outside, moved up to duel the middle half, gave way when the real running began turning for home.

Footnotes
NAUTICAL STAR back off the pace while racing well out in the strip advanced into contention four wide late in the turn, took over nearing midstretch while
lugging in a bit, enough left to gain the nod at the wire. MULLIKIN off a step slow then was squeezed to be last away, raced three wide into the turn, steered
out to be five wide for the drive, set down when straightened for home, late burst on the outside to finish fast to just miss. MIRACLE WORKER settled in mid
pack after breaking with the field, steadied in traffic midway on the turn, continued to be covered up entering the stretch, dropped to the rail lodged an inside
bid late and also finished willingly. MACHO VILLA off a step slow, trailed early, in some traffic toward the inside when beginning to advance late in the turn,
two path for the drive, improved position without posing a threat to the top three. CLAY'S BLACK OPAL set the pace while racing off the inside after
breaking in good order, continued to show the way late in the turn, weakened when headed by the winner in upper stretch. RYVIT lacked speed, floated out
to be five wide turning for home, improved slightly with some mild late interest. SIMOVIC settled in mid pack and three wide, continued one paced through
the lane in lacking a closing kick. KYANDI broke well, closest to the leader to that one's outside, challenged inside the winner and between horses upper
stretch, faltered the final furlong. SWAGGISH broke out, was straightened to race forwardly and inside, backed up through the stretch. MANTA REY in the
second flight early off the inside, gave way entering the turn. SCOTT CITY was never close in showing little.

Footnotes
CALL ME FAST moved up to hold inside position and narrowly show the way in to the first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch, continued to hold a
narrow advantage into the stretch, would not let the runner up go by. GREAT ESCAPE away well, with the pace early, pressed the winner through the first
turn outside that one, continued to apply pressure up the backstretch, crept closer second turn, dueled past the furlong marker, could not get by, remained
clear for the pace. ALEJANDRO lacked early foot, began to move in the two path second turn, came three wide for the drive, closed well to be getting to the
top two late. TIZ RYE TIME back off the pace and the inside, three to four wide exiting the final turn when put to pressure, staged a mild rally, not enough for
the show. NUMBER ONE DUDE four wide into the first turn when with the second flight, appeared to come in a bit to tighten up MAJOR GENERAL,
remained closest to the top two the middle half mile, lugged out our under a left handed crop with a sixteenth to run causing CONGRESSMAN to check up,
weakened a bit to lose a couple of positions. CONGRESSMAN in mid pack while off the inside, three to four wide turning for home, checked up when put in
tight by a lugging NUMBER ONE DUDE with a sixteenth to run, too late to recover. ROMAN CENTURIAN last to leave, lacked speed, picked off a couple of
tiring foes while never a factor. LEAGUE OF LEGENDS saved ground to no avail as he as never a factor. MAJOR GENERAL in the second flight, steadied
when in tight entering the first turn, recovered to settle in mid pack the middle half mile then had little left for the stretch run. DIGITAL settled in the second
flight and in the two path, dropped to the inside second bend, tired through the stretch. RAM raced back on the outside, bore out in the first turn, eased far
turn. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH, NUMBER ONE DUDE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM
FIVE AND PLACED SIXTH.

Footnotes
LAST SAMURAI off a step slow, raced behind traffic through the first turn, crept a bit closer off the inside into the far bend, split foes strongly turning for
home, collared the leader a furlong out and drew clear. WEST WILL POWER came in just after the start to bother a couple of inner rivals, was forwardly
placed into the first turn, made an early move to put a head in front from between horses onto the backstretch, dueled the next four furlongs closest to the
inside, put that rival away when straightened for home but could not contain the winner. LAW PROFESSOR with the early pace, rank late in the first turn
when floated out to be four wide onto the backstretch in some traffic, dueled outside the runner up into the far turn, could not keep up in the drive,
comfortably saved the show. RATED R SUPERSTAR bumped just after the start in tight, fell back to trail, shifted out for the drive, staged a mild rally to be
best of the others. HERO STATUS settled off the pace while four wide through the first turn, continued back and outside, three wide through the second
turn, lacked a response in the drive. LONG RANGE TODDY showed the way into the first turn inside, two path when vying onto the backstretch.
KEYSTONE FIELD away in good order, within striking distance early three wide, continued in that path second bend, had nothing for the drive. GINOBILI
bothered just after the start, within striking distance toward the inside, was appearing to be weakening when bothered when the winner came between
horses exiting the final turn, steadied and moved out, continued to back up stretch.

Footnotes
DOUGHTY with the pace from the start, vied between horses through the turn, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home, drew clear under
steady handling. MAGNOLIA MAE broke out but alertly to bother a couple of outer rivals, raced with the pace along the inside, proved no match for the
winner in the drive, held sway for the place late. HAYTHERE JOGEEGIRL hesitated at the break to spot the field several lengths, moved up closer inside by
late on the backstretch, tapped the breaks into the turn in traffic, moved out to be four wide by the time she was turning for home, finished up willingly to be
up for the show in the final stride. DIAMOND GRAND in mid pack and outside, raced three wide through the turn, roused, angled in a bit stretch, went
evenly to the wire in lacking a late kick. WATCH THIS BIRDIE asway in good order, contested the pace three wide from the outset, continued to vie on the
outside through the turn, was put to pressure for the drive, but had little left, continued to falter to the wire. PAT'S GAL bothered just after break, settled in
the main body along the inside, continued to save ground turn, went one paced through the lane in lacking a closing response. HONEYCAMP carried out
soon after the start by MAGNOLIA MAE, moved up, raced in the two path through the turn, weakened in the drive. DRIVING void of early speed, five wide
into the turn, four wide exiting, failed to muster a rally. ROSALIE'S DESTINY off a step, remained always back. COUNT IT ALL JOY closest to the first flight
off the inside, got out turning for home and gave way. BROOKE'S ALL IN well back while four wide, never a factor. FEATURETTE was finished early.
