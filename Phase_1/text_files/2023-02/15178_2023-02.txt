Footnotes
FLY LIKE THE WIND broke on top, showed the way early just off the inside, headed midway on the turn while remaining in the two path, regained into the
lane, shook clear then held late under steady handling. INDIAN IRISH pressed the winner from the outside in the run up the backstretch, moved up to duel
and put a head in front halfway through the turn, lost the advantage back to the winner when straightened for home, chased that one home, clearly second
second best. SASSY LASS off a step slow, raced back early as a result, steered out to be five wide by late in the turn, staged a mild rally to be clear for the
show, no threat to the top pair. SHE BE SHEEHAN in the second flight while racing toward the inside, moved into the two path for most of the turn, went
evenly through the lane. ICONIC BONNET forwardly placed while racing in the three path, continued in a striking position off the inside through the turn,
came up empty when called on for the drive. SOPHIE'S STAR void of speed inside, continued to save ground, improved of several rivals turning for home,
flattened out in the final furlong. TWINKLING IRISH broke back, lacked speed, three wide through the turn, made little impact by passing a couple of tiring
rivals down the stretch. BE BO in mid pack outside, four down into the turn, dropped down late in the bend causing FINISHWHATUSTARTED to check up,
tired down the stretch. FINISHWHATUSTARTED back off the pace, three wide through the turn, bothered then checked up when. SWEET BABY KATE fell
back to trail, showed little in finishing far back. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH LATE TURN, BE BO WAS
DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED NINTH.

Footnotes
ICARUS last to leave, raced unhurried early, continued under patient handling into the far turn, encountered some traffic late in that bend, split foes in upper
stretch, angled in slightly and challenged the two leaders closest to the inside, late duel, gained nod. SAQEEL lacked speed, advanced into contention three
wide turning for home, challenged inside the furlong marker, late duel while between horses, missed the nod. GREATHEART settled off the pace and the
inside, ranged up into contention four wide turning into the stretch, bid on the outside with less than a furlong remaining, lacked a knockout punch late.
ROCKING ROCKET moved closer before a half off the inside, three wide bid second turn, took over, clear entering the stretch, faltered in failing to last. OUT
RUN'M set or forced the pace while racing off the inside, gave way in the second turn. DRIVEN ONE shuffled back from between the two leaders midway on
the first turn, fell further back after a half and was done. CHEROKEE LEGACY saved ground to no avail in trailing home.

Footnotes
CADDO RIVER never far back, pressured pace up the backstretch, bid far turn, shook clear into the stretch, enough left to hold off the runner up late.
FROSTED GRACE back off the pace along the inside, continued to stalk inside up the backstretch, moved out three wide when moving to challenge in the
final turn, late burst to be getting to the winner. PERFECT FLIGHT pulled early behind the pace, continued to rate into the far turn, closer four wide turning
for home, lacked a closing kick to prove no match for the top two late. MYSTIC NIGHT void of speed off the inside, asked along for run late in the final turn,
staged a mild rally with some late interest, not enough for the show spot. TRIDENT HIT pulled when well back off the pace, continued back middle half mile,
two path into the lane, failed to make an impact late. THOMAS SHELBY broke on top, set the pace along the inside, headed far turn, gradually weakened in
the run to the wire. MAX PLAYER broke awkwardly and lost action soon after, slow to settle, lost action again into the first turn, pulled soon after, vanned
off.

Footnotes
KING RUSSELL settled off the pace along the inside, continued to save ground into the far turn, steered out for the drive, rallied to through traffic, inside bid
late, in time. SEEKING UNITY within striking distance while three wide, crept closer while still in the three path second turn, challenged in upper stretch,
gained the advantage, late bid, nipped at the wire. ONTHESTAGE four wide when in mid pack into the first turn, continued outside in the run up the
backstretch, four wide again second turn, loomed a threat on the outside into the lane, drifted slightly and hung the final furlong. GAME KEEPER lacked
speed off rail, three down to two wide second turn, in tight between horses just inside the furlong marker, went evenly after recovering. TAHOE RUN
forwardly placed one path off the rail, continued to race within striking distance the middle half while remaining in the two path, had little for the stretch run.
QUALIFIED off a step slow, raced back and four wide into the first turn, three wide through the second turn, failed to muster a rally. STORMIN ARMY broke
alertly, clear into the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch, weakened when headed in upper stretch. DELUCA bobbled to be off slowly,
trailed throughout and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SKELLY broke sharp, dueled then was clear while keen early just off the inside, maintained a daylight advantage through the turn while coming out into the
three path late in the bend, stayed clear to the wire under steady handling the final furlong. GO WEST dueled outside the winner soon after the start, fell
back off that one and chased into and through the turn, three to four wide entering the stretch, closing the gap late while holding sway for the place.
KNOCKER DOWN lacked early pace while outside, angled out and was five wide into the lane, staged a mild rally to annex the show. COLD AS HELL one
paced while outside, continued four wide through the turn, outkicked for the show while well clear of the others. MUMAYAZ lacked speed along the inside,
continued one paced while saving ground turn, lacked a significant closing response. UNCLE BUDDY within striking distance along the inside, came up
empty for the stretch run. MANUELITO broke back, fell further back to trail, steered out, came five wide for the drive, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while
never a threat. SEA TO SUCCESS broke back, failed to menace while racing three out to four wide. GINSBURNED was finished early while racing just off
the inside.

Footnotes
GROVE away well, narrowly showed the way from between rivals, shook off the other speed turning for home, maintained daylight to the wire under steady
handling. DAWNY broke back, lacked speed toward the inside, crowded back in tight quarters late in the turn, trailed into the lane, remained along the rail
down the stretch, rallied for the runner up spot. AFTERNOON TEA void of speed, made a quick move into contention along the inside turning into the lane,
moved out a bit and chased the winner past the furlong marker, outkicked by the runner up late. FLYIN BESSIE within striking distance, raced in the two
path through the turn, lacked a closing punch through the lane. BEAUTIFUL BOLT off a step slow, moved outside, four wide through the turn, also went one
paced through the lane. SHARP ATTITUDE fell back after the start, also raced four wide through the turn, also failed to muster a late kick. MARY'S BOON
moved up along the inside to contest the pace for four furlongs gave way. MALIBU TOAST pressed the issue while three wide, gave way in the drive.
ACCELERATING BABE finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
YUUGIRI away in good order, dueled inside up the backstretch, fell back off the other speed early in the turn, moved out into the three path, rebid on the
outside into the stretch, kicked clear, wrapped up late. PRETTY BIRDIE broke sharp, dueled outside the runner up the opening quarter, shook clear early in
the turn, responded when that same rival challenged again into the stretch, could not match that one late, clearly second best. HAZY COMMAND last away,
saved ground through the turn, moved out for the drive, rallied to be clear of the others, no threat to the top two. NOVEL SQUALL back off the pace and the
inside, steadied between foes with just less than a half mile remaining, improved slightly, no real threat. MERCY WARREN chased the duel early off the
inside for a half, faded. TAKE CHARGE LORIN was finished after a half, trailed home.

Footnotes
SPANKSTER lacked speed, asked two path midway on the turn, advanced, switched out when straightened for home, finished with good energy to be in
time. NO SHIRT NO SHOES last to leave after being bothered, lacked early foot inside, continued to save ground turn, rallied up the inside, outkicked in the
late going. ALBIZU void of speed outside, four out to five wide turning for home, rallied while remaining widest, slowly closing the gap on the top two.
FITZPATRICK chased the early from the outside, advanced and dueled in the three path through the bend, narrowly showed the way past the furlong
marker, faltered when headed late. IMPROBABLE JOURNEY broke inward but alertly to bother a couple of inner rivals, showed the way up the backstretch
in the two path, dueled turn, continued to do battle past midstretch then faltered. MUCHO in the second flight while in the three out to four wide into the lane,
had nothing for the drive. FLAP JACK bothered at the start, moved up to race in the second flight early inside, moved out, four wide into the lane, pulled up
late, vanned off.

Footnotes
CHASING TIME back off the pace and the inside, closer in some traffic late turn, waited briefly, split foes nearing the furlong marker, edged clear under firm
handling. OSBOURNE lacked speed, saved some ground early in the turn, came three wide for the drive, moved out, set down, outkicked in the late going
while holding the place. GOLDEN HORNET dueled up front along the inside, fell back off the other speed late in the turn, regained the advantage when
straightened for home, briefly clear a furlong out while drifting in, could not contain the top two. WHELEN SPRINGS broke back, improved inside late in the
turn, moved out a bit past the furlong marker, flattened out the final furlong. MOWINS void of speed off the rail, came four wide for the drive, improved
position with some mild late interest. WHISKEY DOUBLE fell back to trail after the start, continued to lag through the turn, floated out five wide turning for
home, improved slightly while not a serious threat. WAYAKIN in the second flight inside, moved out three wide turning for home while still within striking
distance, came up empty for the stretch run. FORE LEFT broke on top, dueled up front off the inside, slightly larger advantage late in the turn, lost the
advantage back to GOLDEN HORENT upper stretch and faltered. VULCAN forwardly place in the early going while three wide, began steady retreat before
a half.

Footnotes
WET PAINT broke back, outrun through the first turn in the two path, saved ground through the second turn when still well back, eased out a bit for room
past the furlong marker, split foes and finished with good energy to win going away. CONDENSATION broke on top, set the pace toward the inside,
continued to show the way up the backstretch and into the far turn, shrugged off her closest pursuer when straightened for home, clear with a furlong to run,
lugged out to bother GRAND LOVE slightly soon after, proved no match for the winner while holding sway for the place. GRAND LOVE away in good order,
settled behind the pace toward the inside, two path through the final bend, remained with striking distance out in the strip past the furlong marker, bothered
slightly by the runner up not long afterward, finished up evenly in lacking enough late for the runner spot. GAMBLING GIRL back off the pace, advanced
through some traffic late in the final turn, moved out wider in upper stretch, finished willingly to improve position. TOWHEAD settled off the pace, saved
ground through the first, continued inside around the second bend, lacked a closing kick. DEFINING PURPOSE slipped a bit at the break, raced in mid pack
off the inside, three wide into the far turn, angled out five wide into the stretch, roused, lacked a closing response to finish up evenly. TAKE CHARGE
BRIANA fell back to trail into the first turn, continued to lag the middle half, four to five wide late in the final turn, steered far out in the strip to widest in the
drive, managed only mild late interest. OLIVIA TWIST in the second flight outside, three wide again through the second bend, had little left for the stretch
run. TAXED broke with the leaders outside, prompted the winner from the outside for six furlongs, continued to chase into the lane, gave way the final
furlong to lose several positions. EFFORTLESSLYELGANT hesitated at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, moved up to mid pack just off the
inside, failed to muster a rally in the drive. BOSS LADY BAILEY remained always back and was never a factor. DOUDOUDOUWANADANCE in the second
group out in the strip, stopped suddenly far turn, jogged in.

CONFIDENCE GAME in mid pack off the inside early, continued to bide time in the run up the backstretch outside, four wide advance into contention
second turn, took over into the lane, kicked clear past the furlong marker then had enough left to hold the runner up safe. RED ROUTE ONE taken far back
after the start, continued to lag into the far turn just off the inside, began to move midway on that bend, angled out and knifed between horses four wide into
the lane to bump TALLADEGA, continued with good energy while steering in past the furlong marker, brushed with REINCARNATE when that one was
bothered by BOURBON BASH, continued well to the finish to be closing the gap on the winner late. REINCARNATE shuffled back after start, raced well
back, advanced in the two path into the lane, steered out a bit further in some traffic, put in tight by BOURBON BASH past the furlong marker, was checked
up, quickly recovered and displayed some good interest to the wire to finish up best of the rest. VERIFYING forwardly placed while toward the inside,
encountered some traffic late in the final bend and was covered up into the stretch, came out a bit a furlong out for some room, finished up evenly when
clear. BOURBON BASH bothered into the first turn when TALLADAGA came out, remained back the middle half, improved in some traffic into the lane,
came out to bother REINCARNATE in midstretch then weakened. GIANT MISCHIEF steadied in some traffic into the first turn, recovered to race within
striking distance for six furlongs off the inside, had nothing for the drive. GUN PILOT within striking distance along the inside, continued to save ground in
the second flight through the second bend, lacked a closing response. FROSTED DEPARTURE away well, dueled up front off the inside, gave way in the
drive. POWERFUL moved up to briefly be clear into the first turn, dueled closest to the rail the middle half, also backed up when the real running began
turning for home. EVENT DETAIL remained always back while racing three wide. TALLADEGA got out into the first turn, lacked speed, bumped, five wide
into the lane by the runner up, trailed home. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF REINCARNATE AGAINST THE RUNNER UP FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT TAXES broke sharp, pressed the early leader outside, dueled early turn, took over into the lane, drove well clear. CLASSY SOCKS away well,
showed the way up the backstretch inside, raced on equal terms with the winner midway on the bend, could not keep up through the lane, remained well
clear for the place. PEARCY ROAD void of early foot after breaking a step slow, three wide through the turn, rallied inside of horses into the
stretch,continued with interest to annex the show, not a serious threat to the top two. WICKED PRINCE in the main body while racing outside, four wide into
the turn, three wide exiting when with the second flight, finished up evenly in lacking a closing punch. STUCK N SNOW void of speed after being bothered
just after the break, angled out to be seven wide into the lane, displayed some mild interest to improve position. SKYPED behind the pace, saved ground
turn, came up empty for the stretch run. TABLE MONEY settled off the pace and the inside, waited briefly in traffic midway on the turn, failed to respond
when clear for the drive. TIME ANDBEYOND off a step slow, failed to menace. PAID DOUBLE stalked the pace while in the three path for a half, gave way
in the drive. SHAKE UP in the main body along the inside, remained back while two path entering the stretch. HEART HEADED ARKY forwardly placed in
the two path, staged a steady retreat before a half. FOUR DICE lugged out soon after the start, fell back to trail, showed little.
