Footnotes
SPENDAHOLIC was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths marker and drew off with
complete authority. D K'S CROWN was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, could not reach the winner in the drive but
finished with a steady bid. LIL LATIGO was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. ECHO ALPHA SIX was
off a step slow, lagged early, raced off the rail through the turn and did not threaten. GO ADMIRAL GO lacked early foot, raced seven-wide through the turn
and was not a factor. READY TO FORGIVE broke sharply to press the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.

LAST RENEGADE tracked the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew clear. FORGOTTEN
VOWS was away in good order to set a pressured pace, responded when challenged by MR LOVE MUFFIN nearing the five-sixteenths marker, vied with
that rival but could not match strides with the winner through the final furlong. IN THE MIDST settled off the leaders while appearing hard to rate, moved
five-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady bid. BECKHAM JAMES lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn, angled
out further into the lane and finished evenly. ANDY BOBBY showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. MR
LOVE MUFFIN pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths marker and weakened through the final furlong.

Footnotes
REIGN OF FIRE was off a step slow, rush to vie, dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and drew off.
JANERO ROSE broke sharply to dispute the pace while racing four-wide, could not stay with the winner in the drive but finished well to be clearly second
best. STRADARI vied for the early advantage from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive. WAY TO FIRE was
forwardly placed early, raced off the rail through the turn and finished evenly late. MISCHIEF MAMA broke in the air, lacked early foot, raced four-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. PALACE STAR settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and failed to rally. MO CONNELLY
showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. PIRATES CROSS lacked early speed, was carried out nearing the quarter
and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
SPECIAL MOMENT lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and was up late. I AM FREAKY FAST
settled off the leaders from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the sixteenth pole, gained a brief lead but could not resist the winner late. ARIZONA
ANDREW sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and gave way through the final sixteenth. MY MAN BIGGIE was forwardly placed
early, moved five-wide through the second turn, offered a bid in mid-stretch and gave way in the drive. ACCELERITAS was never far back while racing from
off the rail and failed to rally. LOUDMOUTHSOUP pressed the pace while racing three-wide, steadied nearing the three-sixteenths marker and gave way.
FLASHIN ACES was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. PUBLIC OPINION showed no early speed, raced
three-wide through the second turn, angled in with a furlong to run and did not menace. BIG CREED settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through
the second turn and weakened. THE RACE WAS ORIGINALLY HAND TIMED. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.
