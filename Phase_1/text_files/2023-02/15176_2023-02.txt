Footnotes
TOTAL EFFORT disputed the early pace between runners and poked a head in front near the half mile marker, inherited the rail leaving the far turn and
dueled inside a pair of rival, emerged in a battle with STAR SHOPPING leaving the three sixteenths, gained a slim advantage under left handed asking past
the sixteenth pole, kept on tenaciously and proved best. STAR SHOPPING bobbled outward at the break, recovered and vied three wide between horses
early, sparred two wide and between foes around the turn and into the lane, held a slim advantage while outside the winner in mid stretch, ceded command
leaving the sixteenth marker but stayed on gamely to just miss. TENAX forced out some at the break, corrected and edged up four deep and in hand to
attend the pace, prompted three deep around the turn and into the stretch, failed to kick on with the top pair heading to the sixteenth pole and hung a bit
late. PRESSING CONCERN rated in range behind the leading quartet, shifted four wide with a bit of run into the lane but failed to seriously follow through.
THRUSTER broke a step slow, chased to the inside of a rival around the turn, eased out some in the lane but came up empty. HIS ROYAL G vied inside a
trio of rivals heading to the half mile marker, steadied back off runners soon after, dropped back and lacked a recovery.

the final turn, took control and went clear in upper stretch, kept on under under a drive leaving mid stretch and dug in late under steady handling to prevail.
ICY MINISTER , bumped at the start, settled off the dueling leaders, moved up three wide under coaxing into the far turn, took closer order and had dead
aim three wide into the stretch, kept on grinding and steadily gained. LOVE MACHINE was forced in at the break and bumped with a rival, corrected and
settled four wide, circled four wide into the stretch and churned on to nab the show. MARCHED drifted in at the break, moved up some off the rail past the
five eighths, chased three wide and was out finished for the show. STREET HUSTLE dueled outside the winner into and around the first turn, edged clear
under a light hold through the backstretch, was hooked from the rail with a half to go, battled around the final turn, ceded the lead near the quarter pole then
weakened in mid stretch. CAIRO BOOGIE saved ground off the pace and failed to rally.

SHE'LL MAKE WAVES , off last, accelerated along the inner rail to gain the early, remained along the rail, was under urging in the stretch and eagerly
pulled away. LET'S MAKE A ZEEN lacked speed, steadied in traffic in upper stretch, checked lacking room approaching the sixteenth pole and gamely split
rivals to gain the place. WAVERLEY saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and flattened out. GOLDEN BLOSSOM
saved ground around the turn while chasing the winner, angled out turning for home and faded in the drive. FIVE STAR FRAN , three deep on the turn,
chased the pace and weakened. SWEET FACTOR , four wide leaving the turn, weakened. SULTRY SALLY H , three deep entering the turn, chased the
winner to upper stretch, gave way and was eased late. SISTER SPIRIT , four wide on the turn, faltered.

Footnotes
ALBERTANO settled nicely off the inside, commenced a three wide run leaving the far turn, cruised up and attacked the leader from his outside past the five
sixteenths, responded when set down near mid stretch and cleared, kept on under stout right handed asks near the sixteenth pole then held sway. VELVET
GHOST showed speed then rated back to stalk the leader, raced between rivals leaving the half mile marker, edged up then had to wait near the five
sixteenths, eased out a bit to pursue past the three sixteenths, leveled off near the sixteenth marker and closed gamely to the inside of the winner. CARTE
BLANCHE broke outward, corrected and moved clear outside a rival, was a bit keen and opened up while saving ground through the backstretch run, dug in
when collared heading to the quarter pole, battled inside to mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. CURLINGTON broke a beat slow, rated along between
runners early, dropped in around the final turn, moved up while towards the rail in mid stretch, came out for room with a sixteenth to go, rallied and kept on
well through the gallop out. SHOOT THEMESSENGER , three wide between runners near the five eighths, circled four wide into the stretch but lacked a
solid finish. UNEQUIVOCAL lost ground four wide outside rivals, gained ground under coaxing near the five sixteenths, raced three wide between foes into
the stretch and faded. NASHVEGAS saved ground stalking the early pace, eased out for the drive and gave way. ONE TWO KID rated back off foes around
the first turn, saved ground leaving the five eighths and faded. An objection by the rider of VELVET GHOST against the winner for alleged interference near
the three eighths pole was not allowed.

Footnotes
AL LOVES JOSIE prompted the pace two wide under rating, moved through between rivals leaving the far turn, vied then poked a head in front leaving the
five sixteenths, shook clear after being shaken up soon into the lane, had his rider lose the stick with a furlong remaining then widened under a steady hand
ride. NOBLE GASTON , with the pace three deep, applied more pressure near the three eighths, shifted out a bit to be four wide into the stretch, gave hard
chase of the winner from the three sixteenths, stayed on his left lead but held gamely for the place. THREES OVER DEUCES , caught between rivals
chasing the pace, shifted in the for drive, slipped through along the rail past mid stretch and churned on. KENNY HAD A NOTION chased the pace while
saving ground and went evenly through the final furlong. WHISKEY AND YOU , off the pace between foes, shifted out five to six wide and had belated
action outside rivals. EXCULPATORY , three wide between runners nearing the turn, was under pressure past the five sixteenths but failed to generate a
legitimate response. SPUN AND WON broke a step slow, regrouped and edged up four wide nearing the half, pursued three wide around the turn, lacked a
punch past the three sixteenths and faded. GOING TO THE LEAD was shuffled back from between horses leaving the five eighths, dropped further back
leaving the far turn, saved ground into and through the lane and was giving effort to the wire. BORRACHO sped to the front and secured the inside, took
pressure leaving the far turn, battled inside a pair of rivals around the turn, failed to go on in mid stretch and weakened. INDIAN LAKE broke slowly and
raced well wide throughout.
