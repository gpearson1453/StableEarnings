Footnotes
ARCTIC ROSE laid off of the pace in the three to four paths around the first turn, inched closer outside of rivals down the backstretch, gained into the far
turn, bid outside of the leader and in the three path with a quarter mile to go, and drew clear. ARGYBARGY BUCK stalked while tucking from the five path to
the three path around the first turn, then chased the leaders from along the rail around the far turn, vacated the inside in upper stretch, and stayed on to
claim place from an inner rival at the sixteenth pole. THE THREE KS set the pace in the three to two paths in the first turn, showed the way along the fence
around the far turn, but was headed turning for home, and gave way through the lane. HOPE FOR CHANGE pursued from midpack two wide around the
first turn, but failed to respond to urging down the backstretch, gave way approaching the far turn, saved ground while towards the rear around the far turn,
and surpassed outer tiring rivals in the lane. MY HEAVY SON trailed in the five to three paths around the first turn, moved out of last before taking the far
turn in the four path, shifted down to the two path in upper stretch, and lacked a rally between horses. ITELLYOUTHEFACTS pressed the leader while
staying a path away from that foe, but got outmoved by an outer bidder while tucking to the two path entering the far turn, and weakened turning for home.
JUJU NINETEEN lacked speed while hung in the four to five paths around the turn, and made little impact. BAND BOSS tracked from midpack along the
inside, shifted out around the far turn, but was pulled up while guided outwardly at the furlong grounds, and got escorted by the outrider back to his handlers
to walk off.

Footnotes
GOLDEN PALACE lacked speed while remaining in the four path, fanned six wide entering the lane, rallied outside of rivals to bid at the sixteenth pole, and
drove clear. MR. PRIORITY settled off of the pace, tracked in the two to three paths around the turn, shifted five wide entering the lane, rallied to bid along
with an outer rival at the sixteenth pole, got outkicked leaving that juncture, sparred for place with an inner rival in the closing stages, and prevailed. NOSY
BANKER stalked in the four path, bid outside of the leader turning for home, but failed to keep pace with that one in upper stretch, kept on after getting
outkicked by a pair of outer foes in the final furlong, vied for place in deep stretch, but was denied that position. QUEST FOR AVETTE set the pace along
the inside, met an outer challenge turning for home, shook free of that foe in upper stretch, but tired entering the final furlong, and faltered inside of foes in
the final sixteenth. MR. PRODUCTION tracked along the inside, but flopped to and from his right lead at the five sixteenths pole, then chased from behind
the leaders through the lane while lacking a bid. PAT ME DOWN chased from the two path while inside of a pair of foes, then gave way between horses in
upper stretch. WHY JOEY WHY broke a step slow and took up briefly when an outer rival shifted across his path at the start, trailed, and never got involved.
BITSY'S CUSTOM C chased in the three path and between horses around the turn, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
SUMMER SPLASH moved into the first turn with another foe to his outside and one on the inside had to steady a slight bit while the early positioning worked
out, settled into the second tier from the outside down the backside, circle the leaders coming out of the turn, had his sights on the wire and drew away
gamely. BLUE JAYS was in no hurry early, settled along the rail, started picking up speed and gaining momentum with each passing pole, shifted out at the
quarter pole, moved over again the three sixteenth pole where he found wide open space to finish in a strong effort to catch the leader but ran out of room.
Strong effort and was able to secure second. MY BARILEY was three wide near the back of the field early moved up at the half mile pole was within striking
distance at the three eighths pole where he waited for room and saved ground through the turn, found running room at the three sixteenth pole was asked,
responded but it was not enough. CO CONSPIRATOR set the early pace and was joined by another competitor in the first turn, showed the way until he
was caught at the five sixteenths pole and he flattened out after that. SUPER WISE outside trip, no rally. GIMME SOME MO matched strides with the early
leader, backed just off a little while staying on the leaders hip, challenged for the lead at the three eighths pole and tired after the quarter pole.

Footnotes
LIKE MIKE tracked along the inside, bid for the lead two wide entering the lane, and kicked clear. GUITAR TRIBUTE lagged well behind the field around
both turns, cut the gap entering the lane before darting to the seven path to be outside of rivals passing the three sixteenths pole, then rallied to bid for place
at the sixteenth marker, and edged that position late. PAYDAY TOO settled far off of the pace, pursued the main group from the three path, fanned to the
seven path entering the lane, rallied outside of foes while shifting ground inwardly through the lane, gained place at the sixteenth pole as an outer rival
threatened for that position, and got outkicked shortly after. AND FIFTY set the pace along the inside, shook free of a pressing rival around the far turn, but
offered little resistance to the eventual winner's bid leaving the quarter pole, and gave way. IZZY'S BABY BOY tracked two wide and between horses,
shifted four wide entering the lane, but lacked a bid. STEAL IT BACK stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the top pair at the eleven sixteenths pole
before being joined by tracking rivals on both sides shortly after, then yielded between horses turning for home, kept on mildly in the lane, and missed
reaching a minor placing between horses. WAR COUNT laid off of the pace three to four wide, then in the five to six paths around the far turn, and tired.
EVERLOVINGHAND pressed outside of the leader, chased that foe around the far turn, and weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
HIGH TONE was allowed to find his stride from the outside early in the race, stayed wide, came down the lane with a persistence that paid off and was up in
time. CLASSIC KING was extremely far off the pace early, was asked to start picking up the pace and did so in a convincing manner, smartly saved ground
every step of the race caught the field at the quarter pole, slipped up the rail, looked like the winner until right at the wire where he was caught by another
challenger on the outside. POPULIST sprinted from the gate with conviction, hooked another foe from the 2 path, pressured around turn, drifted out a bit late
stretch, gave way. GORMLEYS GOT GAME was bumped at the start by the horse on the inside, once he found his stride he settled mid pack from the three
path, gained ground in turn, angled out at the stretch, worked to switch leads, started to close and was put in tight late, was done after that. CARBON
STRYKER took advantage of the one post position and sent for the lead was pressured by another foe on his out side until the eighth pole, was threatened
by a rival on the inside late and gave way. IRISH HOKIE vied for the early decided to lay off the early pace traveled mid pack started to make a run in the
turn, got within contention at the quarter pole and tired.

Footnotes
MASTER GAME broke a step slow while off awkwardly, settled off of the pace in the four path, ranged up to the leaders four wide entering the far turn, vied
around that bend, inched an advantage in upper stretch, and drew clear entering the final sixteenth. SCHMOOZIN stalked in the three path, bid outside of
the top pair along with an outer rival entering the far turn, vied turning for home, but was outkicked in upper stretch, and saved place from an outer bidder
late. CONSTITUTIONAL LAW stalked along the inside, but was bottled up while not able to slip inside of the leader nearing the backstretch, steadied
entering it, then chased the leading quartet from the two path around the far turn, steadily shifted outside of those foes in the final furlong, then offered a late
kick, but too late to reach place. MORNING CUP set the pace inside of a pressing rival, clung to an advantage from a trio of bidders entering the far turn, got
headed with a quarter mile to go, fought on through upper stretch, but gave way in the final furlong, and lost show in the shadow of the wire. UNIFIED
DREAMS pressed two wide, vied among foes around the far turn, but yielded in midstretch. KEEPCALMCARRYON broke outwardly, settled off of the pace
in the three to two path around the first turn, chased main flight around the far turn, and failed to keep pace turning for home, yet sustained stride through
the lane. PACIFICISLANDTIME broke a beat slow, trailed along the inside, then in the three path around the far turn before swinging to the seven path in
upper stretch, and made little impact. THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION WAS OMITTED AND IS PENDING REVIEW.

Footnotes
FLINT RIDGE was in the middle of the pack in the four path, gathered momentum while he circled from the outside in the turn collared the leaders at the
quarter pole and held on for the win. SPARTAN ARMY was ping ponged around at the was far out of the race early, started to move up at the half pole, was
in touch with the field at the three eighths pole, was brought at the top of the lane where he was put to a long steady drive to the wire where he almost got
the but just missed. ZIPPIN GIGI stayed off the early leader in the second tier from the three and four path, moved up to match strides with the leader in the
turn, found himself in between horses moving out of the turn at the quarter pole, was driven and encouraged down the stretch shook the early leader moved
closer to the rail continued to close but was caught late by a rival on the outside. WISE ANCHOR was close to lead in the beginning, drifted out in the turn
and finished flat. TWIRLING ROSES stayed well off the pace early, was in touch with the field in the turn but had no finish. PRADO'S PRIORITY set the
early pace, from the two path, was caught by other rivals at the quarter pole and stopped. RUSSIAN TANK trailed throughout.

Footnotes
OEUVRE vied along the inside, shook clear in the four path in upper stretch, inched away under driving pressure into deep stretch, and held safely after
being put to wraps in the final sixteenth. NEW BOSS tracked three wide, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, rallied to gain place nearing the furlong
pole, and was inching closer to the clear leader in the closing stages. GOIN' GOOD laid off of the pace two wide, took the turn in the three to four paths,
swung out to the eight path entering the lane, and stayed on willingly. ASTUTE stalked along the inside, chased in the four path while being the clearing
leader in upper stretch, got outkicked by an outer rival for place in midstretch, and yielded in the final furlong. PERFECT HAPPINESS vied two wide,
pressed around the turn, but failed to keep pace after drifting to the six path entering the lane, and gave way between horses. MINER'S QUEEN chased two
wide and from between horses, and tired. MINUTE WALTZ saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. ABOUKIR BAY was outrun in a dull effort.

Footnotes
MUNNINGS CATSLE tracked in the four path and between horses, tipped out to the five path in midstretch while launching a rally, bid at the sixteenth pole,
and edged ahead. RUNAWAY JIM chased the top pair from the three path, grinded away in midstretch to bid for the lead along with an outer foe at the
sixteenth pole, but got outkicked. HARD KINGS steadied when put to crowded quarters between horses at the half mile pole, laid off of the pace along the
inside, shifted out to the four path in midstretch, and rallied between horses late. ASTROLOGYSPROTEGE bumped with an inner foe at the start, dueled
two wide, led narrowly entering the lane, but was outkicked by outer bidders in the final sixteenth. FRIEND'S DO CARE acted up in the gates, dueled for the
lead along the inside, fought on gamely through the lane while headed, and yielded late. CHAD'S FLASH tracked in the five path, and lacked a bid while
hanging on his left lead. CHELSEA'S GLORY bumped with an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, and failed to factor. THEOS
FLEW raced in midpack two wide, and gave way. CHIPEEE tossed his head at the start, lacked speed in the four path, and made little impact. CAJUN
CARLOS was outrun. HALF CRAZY raced towards the rear two wide, and tired.
