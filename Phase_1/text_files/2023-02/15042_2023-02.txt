STYLE trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, began a five wide bid approaching the quarter pole, gained ground outside and got up for the win
late. GLITTER BAY bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, settled at the back of the pack for the opening quarter of a mile, began to move
up racing outside around the turn, entered the stretch in the five path, kicked clear and was caught late. TWELVE RED ROSES raced off the pace on the
inside early, navigated the turn from the two path and improved position late. PONY GIRL chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued
around the bend in the three path and was outkicked in the lane. SPARKLING PLENTY dueled on the outside up the backstretch, dropped back while racing
in the three path around the turn and finished evenly from there. LITTLE RED BUTTON stalked the leaders on the outside through the opening stages,
raced in the four path around the bend and faded in the stretch. ROUGH ENOUGH dueled on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn
and tired in the stretch. I'M A CUTIE bumped with the horse to her inside at the break, recovered to duel between horses through the opening three
furlongs, led the way from the two path around the turn and tired in the lane. DON'T LOSE HOPE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, saved
ground around the bend and was empty from there.

through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the two path and was never a threat. SENTIR ZULIANO brushed with the horse to his inside
at the start, fought his rider and tried to run out from the four path headed around the first turn, settled and led the way up the backstretch, dropped back
while racing in the two path around the far turn and tired further in the lane. GALAXY MUSIC veered out sharply and bumped with the horse to his outside
leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the second turn
