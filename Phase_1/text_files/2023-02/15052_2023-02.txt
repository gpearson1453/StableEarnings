Footnotes
REY O REYES stalked two deep then challenged toward the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms leaving the five sixteenths, raced two deep through
the far turn and dueled determinedly to take the nod in late yards. OFFICER APPEAL rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three
eighths pole and was met at even terms past the five sixteenths, contested the rail through the far turn and dug in gamely to deep stretch before reluctantly
ceding. RIGHTEOUS MAN rounded the opening turn in the four path, started an outside bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on the
far turn and came along for third inside the sixteenth pole. DOHKO raced in the four path the first turn then saved some ground on the second turn, picked
up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and flattened in the lane. DIVINE PROPORTION saved ground, picked up the
chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened in the lane. SIR TERRE settled about the three path and showed little
response through the backstretch. MOUNTAIN TIME rounded the opening turn in the five path and settled off the pace from the seven eighths pole, raced in
the four path on the second turn and showed little response leaving the half mile pole. HIGH PRINT saved ground and faded past the three eighths pole.
The Steward reviewed, then dismissed, a claim of foul against the rider of Rey O Reyes for alleged interference in late stretch, lodged by the rider of Officer
Appeal.

GRUMPY'S BUDDY stalked the early pace from the three path, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced close in the three and four paths of
the far turn and dueled for the nod in later yards. LOVETHEBAND took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace,
came under pressure approaching the three eighths, contested the edge just off the rail on the far turn and dueled at even terms from the eighth pole before
relenting later yards. FUNKLE rated close inside, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened inside the eighth
pole. KAYLEE'S SPITFIRE rounded the first turn about the four path and left the turn outside, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the
four path of the far turn then flattened stride. DE'S CASTLE took a brief early lead while tapering in then stalked, gave chase toward the three eighths pole
but dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened in the lane. CRUSH 'N RUN saved ground on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole
but weakened while losing ground on the far turn. JUBAY settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened off

Footnotes
HAZEDNCONFUSED stalked from the four path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn
and dueled through the final sixteenth to inch away from BROAD IMAGINATION, who took over nearing the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to
rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths, rounded the far turn near the rail but was met leaving the sixteenth pole and relented;
reluctantly. HE'S CLEVER settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase from the nine sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, eased
to the outside leaving the turn and finished well to take third the final strides. JUST MURPHY rated close to the early pace inside, bid at the rail nearing the
quarter pole, raced close through the upper stretch then flattened late yards. GATTO BE PROUD was reluctant to load, came out a step slow and brushed
the gate on exit, rounded the first turn about the five path, raced outside into the backstretch and gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the
four path of the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. CURB THAT TIGER saved ground. TIME TO CHOOSE tapered in to stalk two deep, gave chase leaving
the seven sixteenths pole but faded in the three path of the far turn. Harpersgonefishing flipped in the gate and was a late scratch.

Footnotes
ENTRY TIME became edgy in the gate, gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the three path, eased out leaving the turn, dug in
for the lead later yards and raced clear under the wire. CHIPPEWA'S CASTLE gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn, eased out entering the stretch and
finished well to take second the final strides. BERTRAM FLIGHT chased toward the inside, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened later yards. CATS
DIAMOND BOY was hustled on the lead toward the inside, raced at the rail on the turn, drifted leaving the turn, was caught past the eighth pole and
flattened the final sixteenth. TALKING TEDDY chased toward the inside, raced off the rail on the turn, eased out leaving the turn then steadied past the
sixteenth pole. MIO GRACELAND chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. DONNIE B broke a step slow, was never a factor
and came through the lane in erratic paths. WINDSOR'S TRACKER was not a factor.

Footnotes
MYGIDGETMARIE drew clear while tapering in through the backstretch and set a pressured pace, raced at the rail on the turn and was steadily handled to
widen. HOLY HIP chased the early pace outside, raced near the rail on the turn and had to settle for second best. PRINCESS MIA ROSE came away a bit
awkwardly and steadied from a narrowing opening toward the seven sixteenths pole, picked up the chase from the three eighths, raced at the rail on the turn
and dueled through the stretch for third. RED LIL SHIPMENT chased toward the inside, raced at the rail on the turn, drifted leaving the turn and was
outfinished in the stretch duel for third. FESSIN UP gave chase toward mid track, raced in the five path of the turn and ran evenly in the lane. BODIE'S
STORM chased the early pace inside, rounded the turn off the rail and passed rivals in the lane. SUDDEN FLARE chased toward the outside, rounded the
turn in the six path and flattened in the lane. MY BEST GIRL gave chase toward mid track, raced in the four path of the turn then weakened. NANNY'S
MISSION gave chase toward the inside, rounded the turn near the rail and weakened in the lane.
