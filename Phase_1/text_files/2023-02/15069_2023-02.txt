Footnotes
SOUNDS SPOOKY coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to
take narrow command a furlong out, dug in dueling to the finish and gamely held on to prevail. STORMANDY dueled three then two wide with THAT'S MY
BUSINESS to his inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and shook off that rival, swung five wide for home, dug in confronted by the top one,
dueled once more through the stretch headed for the front a furlong from home, fought on game to the end but was ultimately bested on the wire. STEADY
PROGRESS three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing half a mile from home, went seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid to latch on the top pair a
furlong out, then got repelled while keeping on to secure the show honors. THAT'S MY BUSINESS coaxed from the start, dueled from the two path, tucked
inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and weakened in the late stages. DISTURBED chased along
the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. AWESOME WEAPON chased four to five wide under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun four wide for home, trailed.

Footnotes
MARIAH'S FORTUNE broke out at the start, prompted the pace on the outside of the leader, turned up the pressure in the three path around the turn,
passed the five-sixteenths on even terms for the lead, took the advantage outside the quarter-pole, spun five wide into the stretch then shook clear, drifted
out inside the furlong marker, swapped back to her inside lead coming to the sixteenth-pole and held under steady urging. INDIAN BELLA bumped with a
rival while hustled from the start, angled out leaving the chute, established a good position behind the top two, chased in the four path around the turn, was
driven six wide into the stretch then pursued the winner on the outside, drifted out into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while just able to hold the
place. BLUE PAYNT bumped with a rival at the start, went to the front, showed the way with company to her outside, was asked in the two path on the turn,
lost the advantage to the winner outside the quarter-pole, dropped back in the three path under a drive in upper stretch, kept on in the final furlong and just
missed the place while clear for the show. ITS COLD IN DEHERE was hustled from the start, settled on the inside of a rival, was urged five wide around the
turn, came eight wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. PRAIRIE FIRE broke out at the start then was corrected, was coaxed along off the pace, moved
in with five furlongs to run, went around most of the turn in the two path then shifted four wide, swung seven wide into the stretch and came up empty.
GRINGOTTS was restless in the gate, moved out then settled on the far outside, was urged six wide around the turn, dropped to the four path approaching
the quarter-pole and failed to respond. VALLARAND was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch and was no
factor then reported to have bled while walked off.

Footnotes
SPIRIT OF ST LOUIS got bumped at the start by CENTRAL PRIDE, who broke outwards and in turn bumped VALENTINO'S HERE, chased four to five
wide advancing through the turn into contention three furlongs from home, seized command at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, went
clear under a drive and was geared down inside the final sixteenth. REFUAH six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the
turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on clear of the rest to be
along second best. OLYMPIC DREAMS chased just off the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and
improved position to secure the show honors. CENTRAL PRIDE broke out at the start bumping SPIRIT OF ST LOUIS into VALENTINO'S HERE, dueled
from the two path with EIGHT AND SAND to his outside, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths tucked to the inside, yielded the front near the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened. VALENTINO'S HERE got bumped at the start by SPIRIT OF ST LOUIS due to pressure from
CENTRAL PRIDE breaking outwards, chased four then three wide down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. EIGHT AND SAND dueled from the four path down the backstretch and then
just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths got displaced in tandem with his main pace rival near the five-sixteenths by the
eventual winner, swung four wide for home and tired. SQUID GAMER coaxed from the gate, chased six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then four wide through the turn, went nine wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact. TIE BREAKER chased three then two wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
IRISH EXIT was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside under urging around the turn, spun three wide into the stretch,
responded well under the crop in the drive and held under steady urging. FROMANOTHAMUTHA prompted the pace on the outside, was asked in the two
to three path on the turn, dropped back near the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, pursued the winner into the final furlong, kept on well to
the wire and finished willingly to just get the place. COMPLETE AGENDA was hustled from the gate, established a good position just off the pace, was
urged along late on the backstretch, chased inside to the two path around the turn, hesitated while in tight off heels in the three path at the quarter-pole,
pursued the winner in the stretch and also finished willingly but just missed the place while clear for the show. DOCTOR LOVE settled just off the pace, was
asked in the three to four path on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and weakened. BLU GROTTO showed no speed, angled in leaving the chute,
went three to four wide around the turn and was no factor. HANG TIGHT was last to commence, dropped well back, raced inside to the two path around the
turn and showed little.

Footnotes
FABULOUSLY FUNNY four then three wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took over narrow command swinging
three wide into upper stretch, inched away under a drive kept to task. SPELTERINI coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing
near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. RISK FREE got lightly bumped at the start by MY GIRL JAL
due to pressure from SWANSON LAKE, chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild kick. WONDER GIRL hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch displaced narrowly from command, weakened in the late stages. SWANSON LAKE stumbled awkwardly at the
start bumping MY GIRL JAL into RISK FREE, chased along the inside and was bumped off stride by TAP IT UP who tucked in from the outside five furlongs
from home, came under coaxing along the rail at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. MY GIRL JAL got bumped
between foes at the start and was lightly pinched out, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and passed tired
rivals. BALENTINA broke in at the start bumping TAP IT UP, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper
stretch and offered no response. TAP IT UP got bumped at the start by BALENTINA, crossed to the two path near the five-eighths bumping SWANSON
LAKE off stride, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
MAJORITY PARTNER broke a step slow then was taken up while pinched back between horses, moved up on the outside, was asked in the three path on
the turn, chased while remaining on his inside lead in upper stretch, swapped to the proper lead outside the furlong marker, gained to make a bid outside
the sixteenth-pole and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. SCILLY CAY dropped well back early, went around the turn in the two path, found his best
stride in the stretch and finished fast to just miss while narrowly up for the place. LISTENTOYOURHEART brushed with a rival at the start, was coaxed
along off the pace, moved in around the nine-sixteenths, saved ground for most of the turn then shifted four wide, chased outside into the final furlong then
made a bid, battled with the winner to the wire and just missed while caught for the place but earned the show. DURKIN'S CALL was urged along off the
pace, went around the turn in the two path, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, shifted further out in the final furlong and finished with good energy for
the last spot in the superfecta. EXCELLENT TIMING went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action in the two path around
the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, drifted out some near the furlong marker and was overtaken then weakened. MASKED MARAUDER
settled off the early pace, angled out outside the five-eighths, went four then five wide around the turn, came six wide into the stretch and gained but failed
to impact. WRITER'S REGRET brushed with a foe at the start, moved out while chasing near the five-eighths, dropped back while shifting further out leaving
the backstretch, went four then five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
DOWNTOWN MISCHIEF four then three wide in aim of the front, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took over command swinging five wide into
upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, held clear to the finish to prevail. MIDTOWN LIGHTS chased three wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to be along well clear of the rest and second best. SECURITY CODE chased
along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. QUEENS
MASTERPIECE chased three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled seven wide into upper stretch offering up a bid a furlong out, then
weakened in the late stages. LOCKBOX coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, got placed to coaxing midway,
angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. MY SWEET KHAILE chased five then four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went six to seven
wide into upper stretch and tired. VAX coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into
upper stretch and tired. PRETTY MISS KEENS stumbled at the start, showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under coaxing when under threat
at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front spinning three wide into upper stretch, then faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
FLATTERING GAL settled on the outside, was urged five wide around the turn, came seven wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and
closed strongly to win going away. FULIGNI showed good speed, contested the pace on the inside of two foes, vied in the two path on the turn, remained on
her inside lead in the stretch and was overtaken while clear for the place. MY INNER VOICE was urged along off the pace, raced inside to the two path
around the turn and improved for the show. MRS BELL dropped well off the pace, went six wide around the turn, came eight wide into the stretch then
moved further out and also improved but just missed the show. FOLLOW THE FED was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came five
wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. BAD CONNECTION was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the outside then in the four
path around the turn and tired. WINE GODDESS was urged along towards the rear, moved from the rail to the three path around the turn and was no factor.
MADAME ROSE disputed the pace between horses, was asked in the three path on the turn, dropped back late on that bend and capitulated. DELIGHTFUL
RITA dropped well behind the rest of the field, raced inside to the three path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch then moved further out and was no
factor. WAR MUSEUM was coaxed along off the pace, steadied between horses approaching the half-mile pole then dropped back, moved out at the
seven-sixteenths, went four to five wide around the turn and came up empty. MAIZE LOVED LAFFY was urged along off the pace, came inward nearing the
half-mile pole, went three then two wide around the turn and failed to respond.
