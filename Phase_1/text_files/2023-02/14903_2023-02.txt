Footnotes
DOLICE VITA rated a slim lead inside, was met and dueled from the half mile pole, contested even terms at the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly
to eke out the advantage over the game challenge of RAISE A SPEIGHTS, who stalked from the three and four paths and challenged three wide into the
backstretch, contested even terms from that point and raced two deep on the far turn, dug in gamely through the final furlong but needed a bit more.
BURGEE rated close off the rail, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and came along for third inside the sixteenth
pole. TOE TAPPIN LUKE raced with the pace two deep, challenged between horses into the backstretch but dropped back at the five sixteenths pole and
faded at the rail on the far turn. INDIANA RED raced off the rail and never factored. BLUEBERRY MASH rounded the first two turns in the four and five
paths, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded approaching the quarter pole. TIZBIT settled off the early pace about the three path,
gave chase from the half mile pole but showed little response.

Footnotes
DANNY'S WINKSTER took over while tapering to the inside and was firmly rated to set the pace, dug in to the challenge of BRISTOL CHANNEL and
Wesright nearing the half mile pole and recovered the even terms at the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, drifted into the
lane but dug in under steady handling and held on well. BRISTOL CHANNEL steadied off the inside flank of Danny's Winkster early then rated close in the
two and three paths, challenged into the backstretch and dueled close two deep on the far turn, came inside the drifting winner leaving the turn but flattened
the final sixteenth. TAKE AIM rated close inside on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail,
then dueled for third past the eighth pole. BODYSLAM settled two deep on the first turn, picked up the chase into the backstretch and rounded the far turn
off the rail, eased out entering the stretch but showed little more. WESRIGHT tapered in and stalked two deep, took a slim lead into the backstretch and was
coaxed into a duel toward the three eighths pole, gave up the lead past the five sixteenths, dropped back leaving the quarter and flattened at the rail on the
far turn. UNKNOWN AGENDA rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase from the half mile pole but showed little response. LOOKA LOOKA
checked of the heels of Bristol Channel early on and was never a factor. ONLY GET'N BETTER saved ground. SUPER DREAMER rounded the first turn
about the five path and was never a factor. After reviewing a claim of foul for interference soon after the start, lodged by the rider of Bristol Channel, against
the rider of Danny's Winkster, the Stewards disqualified Danny's Winkster to seventh place for initiating a chain reaction which affected both Bristol Channel
and Looka Looka.

NEVER COMPROMISE settled in the three path the first turn, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved three wide on the far
turn, took the lead approaching the head of the lane and was steadily handled to widen. INSTIGATED stalked two deep, challenged toward the seven
sixteenths pole and dueled to a slim brief lead two deep midway on the far turn, but was met approaching the head of the lane and had to settle for second
best. CURLIN'S MALIBU rated close inside, gave chase leaving the nine sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then eased out toward the top of
the stretch and came along for third late yards. ROYAL THUNDER rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the seven sixteenths pole, was
met at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened stride leaving the turn. MEGA MILLIONS angled to the inside and settled well off the pace, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. ELVIRUS broke through prior the break then saved ground on the first turn and showed
little response through the backstretch. JUNGLE WARRIOR raced in the five path the first turn, left the turn outside and never factored. CLASSY
SOLUTION drifted to the four path into the first turn, gave chase from the half mile pole then faded about the five path of the far turn.

Footnotes
ELLIES LIL CASTLE stalked two deep, challenged past the half mile pole and dueled with a slim disadvantage from that point, contested the far turn two
deep then dug in under determined handling to edge out SAYYESTOTHELADY in the final yards. The latter moved to the inside and rated the pace, came
under pressure leaving the half mile pole and contested the advantage from that point, raced at the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady handling leaving
the turn but grudgingly ceded the final yards. MIDNIGHT BRASS stalked the early pace from the three path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail, drifted outward in the upper stretch but closed the gap in later yards. BAYS CASTLE rounded the first turn about the three
path, left the turn outside and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn then flattened in the lane. WHALE OF A
TIME exchanged contact with BREADMAN'S ROSEBUD leaving the gate then stalked from the three path, gave chase into the backstretch but weakened
at the rail on the far turn. The latter exchanged contact with Whale Of A Time leaving the gate, raced off the rail on the first turn and showed little response
through the backstretch. EX RATED saved ground, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but showed little response.
