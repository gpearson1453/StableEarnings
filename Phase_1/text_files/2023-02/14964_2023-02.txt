saved ground on the turn but was no match for the winner in the end. IM THE MACHINE was unhurried early then rallied three on the turn, was two wide for
the stretch drive and was no threat. SCORE KEEPER rallied three wide on the turn making a bid but was no menace. HAPPY ROMANCE was unhurried
early then made a mild rally and was no threat. DARYLSLITTLEDIABLO was unhurried early then failed to menace. CONNORS OUTLAW was through after
a half and gave way. MY GOLDEN M chased the early pace while inside, was used up and stopped.
