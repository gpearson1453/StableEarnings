Footnotes
MOODY RAFAELA was off the pace in the three path then took the lead at the quarter pole and drew off in the stretch. TENPINS TEMPEST raced in the
middle of the pack to the turn then made a four wide bid at the quarter pole for a late run and proved to be second best. BOSTON BELLE had the early
speed but was headed at the quarter pole and gave way grudgingly. VALID BREAK raced in the middle of the pack around the turn then moved between
horses at the sixteenths pole to show late interest. OUR CLOVER GAL bumped with THURSDAY MORNING at the start then tracked the leaders down the
backstretch on the inside, moved out to two wide on the turn but finished evenly. GRAEME'S DEAL had no early speed and passed tiring rivals.
THURSDAY MORNING bumped with OUR CLOVER GAL at the start then made a mild rail bid but flattened out. YES I'M A LADY had good early speed to
the five sixteenths pole, was game around the turn and gave way late. ROADSIDE GIRL was not a threat.

Footnotes
OUTLAW X. stalked the pace from the three path then took the lead at the quarter pole to prove much the best. MIAS MOONBEAM was allowed to settle
around the first turn then steadily advanced down the backstretch, made a five wide bid at the five sixteenths pole and gave a late surge to be up for the
place. HOLY EMPEROR pressed the pace from the inside to the top of the stretch and weakened. LIKEN IT was fractious in the gate, saved ground
throughout, made a mild inside bid on the turn to prove best of the rest. SONIC CITY raced near the back around the first turn then made a four wide bid at
the five sixteenths pole to improve position. CONGA BOY was hustled along to take a pressured lead from the two path to the quarter pole and tired. YES
BAB raced in the middle of the pack but was not a factor. MR B QUIET saved ground to no avail. JUSTA SWINGING was always back and was vanned off.
MISS BILLIE K was off the pace in the four path to the three eighths pole and stopped.

ALL OF US dueled for the lead from the three path to the three eighths pole then inched away to prove best. COUNTRY CAT JAKE dueled for the lead from
the four path and fought gamely to the wire. RUN CARLOS was off the pace in the two path then moved out to three or four wide on the turn and made a
late rally to be up for show. A SOLDIER'S WAY was off the pace in the four path then made a three wide bid at the quarter pole but was out finished in the
stretch. FLASH FREDDIE veered out at the start then lacked early speed, made a four wide bid in upper stretch to improve position late. EASY EDDIE A
was unsettled in the gate, raced near the back around the turn and passed tiring rivals. SETTLE ON SOMETHIN pressed the pace from the two path to the
three eighths pole and weakened. THE BOYZ REAL DEAL was not a factor. PALLATON was off the pace on the inside to the five sixteenths pole and

MEDWAY QUEEN went to a pressured lead to the top of the stretch, drove clear and just lasted. US SECOND CUTE PIE raced in the middle of the pack to
the final turn then moved out to four or five wide in upper stretch for a late rally and just missed. WHO DAT GREY pressed the pace from the three path and
fought gamely to the wire. BEAUX TOX was allowed to settle down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the final turn to give late effort but was no match
for the top three. EL CALIENTE LADY was unhurried down the backstretch then made a two wide bid on the final turn and improved position. MILA'S KAT
was away alertly from the gate but went five wide into the first turn, made a mild bid on the final turn and finished evenly. BRI stalked the pace from the
inside then moved out to three wide at the quarter pole but lacked the late response needed. MISS CHECKMARK was always back. SASSY EMMA pressed
the pace from the two path to the five sixteenths pole and gave way. TAPIT'S LADY was forwardly placed in the two path to the final turn and retreated.

Footnotes
MO VODKA led throughout while setting all the pace and proved much the best. DARK MATTER saved ground down the backstretch then moved out to two
wide on the final turn but was no match for the winner and proved best of the rest. UNBRIDLED PULPIT was allowed to settle around the first turn then
moved up from three wide around the final turn and made a late bid to be up for the show. BIG SESSY raced in the middle of the pack from off the rail then
made a mild bid on the final turn but only passed tiring rivals. JOHNNY JUDE stalked the pace from the three or four path to the three eighths pole and tired.
FIFTYFIVE STRONG was unhurried down the backstretch then made a four wide bid on the final turn but flattened out. K R TARGET was forwardly placed
in the three path to the quarter pole and weakened. A STAR IS BORN NOW was through after a half. CORRENTE DE OURO was off the pace in the two
path to the five sixteenths pole and gave way. WILDCARD GOLD stumbled to his knees, lost rider at the start and walked off.

Footnotes
CHEERFOR MSHAWISH raced near the back around the first turn then engaged the leaders at the three eighth pole and dueled around the final turn and
drew off in the stretch. MO CREDO raced in the middle of the pack to the final turn then made a three wide bid on the final turn and fought gamely to the
wire to just be up for the place. THEO D'OR was bumped by PAPIRINGO at the start and had to steady shortly after the break, advanced from three or four
wide down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the final turn and fought gamely but missed the place. JAMAICAN ME tracked the leaders down
the backstretch, engaged the leaders at the three eighths pole and dueled around the final turn but tired. KING OF CONTRABAND raced near the back
down the backstretch then moved between horses at the quarter pole and flattened out. TOLATETOOWAIT broke in slightly at the start then was within
striking distance to the five sixteenths pole and dropped back. SALUTE NOW cut the corner to take the lead into the first turn, held that position to the three

but was a clear second. SOURNOIS saved ground to the final turn then moved out to four wide but was no match for the top two. HIGH RIDGE was
unhurried down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the final turn for a late run to be best of the rest. FLUFFPOINT was allowed to settle to the
final turn then made a two wide bid to improve position. SWEET RACHEL saved ground down the backstretch made a three wide bid on the final turn and
passed tiring rivals. M AND M'S CUSTOM raced in the middle of the pack but was not a factor. SEMI CHARMED LIFE was hustled along to the first turn

Footnotes
HYPERBOLIST was unruly in the gate prior to the start, unhurried down the backstretch then made a looming three wide bid at the quarter pole, dueled
down the stretch with SEARCH ENGINE and prevailed. SEARCH ENGINE was unruly in the gate before the start then was allowed to settle around the first
turn and down the backstretch, made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole and dueled down the stretch with HYPERBOLIST but was not enough.
ROYAL CONSORT sprinted away from the gate to take a clear lead and set all the pace but was nailed in the final yards. LIFE IS A BANQUET saved
ground from off the pace around the first turn then moved up into the final turn but faltered in the stretch. ELUSIVE WAR stalked the pace around the first
turn and slowly faded. MEANT FOR ME raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground to no avail. MATTS FIRE N ICE was restless in the gate then
tracked the leaders to the quarter pole and dropped back.

Footnotes
TALK TO TOKEY vied for the early lead then took the lead at the quarter pole and drew clear. BYATHREAD had good brief speed to take and early lead
then pressed the pace but was a game second. HINDOSTAIN FALLS had no early speed, made a three wide bid on the turn for a late rally to be up for
show. RED RAIDER XPRESS tracked the leaders from the four path then moved in to be three wide at the quarter pole but flattened out. COUNT ON RAIN
stalked the pace from the three path then moved in to the rail going into the turn but tired. MALIBU MONEY saved ground from off the pace and faded.
MIDGE'S TIME raced in the middle of the pack but was not a factor. GONE SOLUTION raced near the back and was not a threat. FIGHTING SOLDIER
was outrun.
