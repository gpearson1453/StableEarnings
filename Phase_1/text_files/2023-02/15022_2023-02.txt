Footnotes
JEDREK away in good order, ,dueled up front closest to the inside, disposed of that rival midway on the final turn, shrugged off a second foe entering the
stretch, turned back another rival from the inside with less than a furlong remaining, held the runner up safe late in a determined effort. GREATHEART
lacked speed along the inside, continued to save ground second turn, closer, rail bid nearing midstretch, failed to sustain that advance late, saved part of the
place. MAHAAMEL raced in the second flight while off the inside, remained within striking distance between horses in the far turn, lost position in traffic late
in that bend, steered out midstretch, found best too late to be rapidly getting to the winner in the waning strides while finishing on equal terms with
GREATHEART. CARNIVORE void of speed, off the inside, came three wide for the drive, displayed some mild interest to improve position without posing a
serious threat. ICARUS five wide into the first turn, remained within striking distance outside, three wide for the drive, was tiring when in tight late.
MIACOMET off a step slow, trailed early, continued back final turn, lacked response stretch. STELLAR TAP dueled up front outside the winner for six
furlongs and gave way.

Footnotes
GOLD BUCKLE dropped inside when in mid pack first turn, crept closer while continuing along the rail second turn, progress stalled in traffic entering the
stretch, moved out, collared leader, drew off, ridden out. CALIFORNIA SWING forwardly placed toward the inside first turn, continued to pursue the two
leaders up the backstretch, advanced and challenged three wide turning for home, took over, briefly clear, proved no match for the winner the final
sixteenth, lugged out late, bothered foe. FIRST LINE void of speed in the two path first turn, continued back, saved ground early far turn, steadied briefly
midway on that bend, improved inside of several foes into the stretch, moved out and split foes with less than a furlong remaining and was getting to the
runner up late. LOOKIN HIGH behind the pace off the inside, came three wide for the drive, was going evenly inside the furlong marker when bothered by a
lugging CALIFORNIA SWING, checked up and continued one paced to the wire. COOL RUNNINGS got out into the first turn carrying several rivals out, was
straightened and showed the way onto the backstretch in the two path, remained the leader until headed by CALIFORNIA SWING entering the stretch then
faltered. JACKS SPRING BREAK carried six wide into the first turn, angled in a bit, four to five wide late in the second bend, went evenly to the wire in
lacking a closing response. PRINCIPE GUILHERME fractious in the gate, raced back and inside, continued to save some ground far turn, made little impact
through the stretch. HOLDING PATTERN carried four wide into the first turn, chased the middle half mile, gave way in some traffic turning into the stretch.
RYE HUMOR last to leave, remained void of speed, 3-4w into lane, failed to rally. TWITTY CITY in mid pack for five furlongs, backed up. SAHM TEQUILA
carried five wide into the first turn, remained outside, four to five wide again when tiring turning for home, continued to back up through the stretch.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH, CALIFORNIA SWING WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR
INTERFERENCE AND PLACED FOURTH.

Footnotes
HOME RUN TRICK broke on top, rated kindly in showing the way up the backstretch, continued in hand far turn, extended advantage into the stretch,
enough left to hold off the next two late. DERBY CODE void of early foot, continued well back into the far turn, waited briefly behind horses late in that turn,
steered out widest for the drive, finished up willingly while too late. COLOSI hesitated at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, moved up to mid
pack, two path and inside several rivals to improve into the lane, also was closing the the gap on the winner late while being outkicked for the second spot.
BIG COUNTRY hopped at the start, void of speed, came four wide for the drive, improved upper then flattened out a bit in the late going. BUDDY REAUX
went one paced throughout while racing three wide. ESKENFORIT forwardly placed for five furlongs while off the inside, was finished after five furlongs.
LITTLE DEMON off a step slow, was used a bit to move up closest to the winner, chased that one for six furlongs then gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
CONDENSATION broke alertly, set all the pace along the inside, continued to show the way while saving ground into the lane, drifted out late, enough left to
withstand the runner up. DEAR LADY moved well out in the strip first turn, continued outside, five wide into the far turn, four wide exiting, getting to the
winner late while being floated out by that one a bit. BLUELIGHTSPECIAL pressed the winner from the outside, could not keep up with that one into the
stretch nor contain the runnerup, battled back for the place. U GLOW GIRL stalked the pace while three wide, remained within striking distance the middle
half, came up empty for the stretch run. LUCKY DEPUTY void of speed along the inside, continued to lag while saving ground far turn, angled out sharply to
be five wide into the lane, made little impact to the wire. BOLT FOR ALLISON settled off the pace and the inside, moved closer four wide and inside the
runner up into the far turn, lacked a further advance. DEMI off a step slow, fell further behind when sluggish, still lagged far turn, displayed a modest amount
of late interest after the issue had been decided.

Footnotes
ASPEN CLUB close from the start while racing outside, vied four wide through the turn and into the stretch, kicked steadily clear the final furlong under
steady handling. LORD M in the second flight while racing off the inside, angled out to be four wide exiting the turn, finished willingly to earn the place, not a
serious threat to the winner. ATTA PARTY broke on top, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch and through the turn closest to the inside, could not
match strides with the winner the final furlong, caught late for the place. TRAFFIC CONTROL broke in good order, with the pace while between horses, first
to blink of the first flight entering the stretch. SOBRIETY off a step slow, raced four wide through the turn, improved position while not posing a threat to the
top four. BOTANY bumped at the break, lacked speed, three wide into the stretch, also improved a bit while not a serious threat. TALE OF TRUTH off a step
slow, moved up to race in mid pack in the two path into the turn, had little left for the stretch run. BRASKA broke back, lacked speed, steered out to be five
wide into the stretch, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. SUPER GEEK in the main group outside, moved closer four wide
late in the turn, flattened out through the stretch. BILLHILL bore out at the start to bother a couple of outer rivals, raced three wide into the turn, gave way by
midway on the bend. DRIVER was finished after four furlongs while saving ground. ONEIGHTHUNDREDCASH bumped at the start, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
UNDECODED came in just after the start, settled off the pace three wide, closer turning for home, altered course to the outside for room past the furlong
marker, late surge to be narrowly up at the wire. IPSUM GRATUS bumped at the start, recovered to race forwardly along the inside, boxed in far turn, got
through and challenged entering the stretch, took over, clear a furlong out, nailed. XYLOPHONE void of speed, began to move far turn, came five wide for
the drive, finished willingly to miss between horses at the wire. CLOSE TO ME steadied just after the start in tight, trailed well back, swung five wide for the
drive, was going well late while widest of the first flight, too late. FIRST EMPRESS lacked speed while four wide through the first turn, continued well out in
the strip, four wide again in the second bend, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing punch. HOPING FOR A RING fractious gate, bothered soon
after the break, saved ground first turn, continued inside, brief wait behind traffic late in the second turn, one paced along the rail stretch. DUCHESS
BUBBLES lacked speed outside, three to four wide second turn, improved position slightly while not a serious threat. LEGENDARY GIFT forwardly placed
while three wide, remained in striking position in that path through the second bend, faltered the final furlong. TRULY A ROCKET bumped at the start,
settled in the second flight just off the inside, tired. DISTORTED SECRETS narrowly showed the way early, garnered a larger advantage in the second turn,
caved when headed turning for home. BID FOR POWER came in just after the start, was straightened, dueled up front off the inside, stopped in the second
turn, far back, jogged in.

SILVER PROSPECTOR off the pace while well wide into the first turn, four path through that bend, remained outside, circled to the fore while still four wide
second bend, quickly clear, firm handling to the wire. SUPER STOCK behind the pace while toward the inside, two path second turn, brief wait behind traffic
late in that ben, steered out to be four wide for the drive, proved no match for stablemate, held sway late for the place. SOY TAPATIO void of speed off the
inside, four wide into the far bend, five wide into the stretch, rallied down the middle of the strip and was getting to the runner up late. THOMAS SHELBY in
the second flight just off the inside, traffic far turn when three wide, angled out to be five wide for the drive, came up empty for the run to the wire. TUT'S
REVENGE broke on top, pressed early three wide, vied between rivals into the far turn in the three path, weakened through the lane. BACKGROUND
showed the way into the first turn, vied the middle half while closest to the rail of the first flight, faltered turning for home. SPA CITY shuffled back at the
break, lacked speed, failed to muster a rally. HE'SMYHONEYBADGER vied up front while between horses for six furlongs and gave way.

Footnotes
JACKMAN in the second flight three wide, advanced on the two leaders late in the turn, dueled past the furlong marker and into deep stretch outside the
runner up, proved best in a determined effort. CLASSIC MOMENT close from the start outside, dueled through the turn, between rivals and inside the
winner entering the stretch, dueled with that one after the other speed dropped away soon after, remained on even terms to the wire, outkicked. UNCLE
BUDDY vied early while between horses, shuffled back a bit with a half mile remaining, lacked clear room behind traffic through the bend, clear for the drive,
saved the show while not a threat to the top two. MISTER MMMMM broke out to help pinch back, VICTORY MARCH, raced in the second group outside the
winner, four wide through the turn as a result, went one paced through the stretch in not having enough for the third spot. ABSOLUTE CHAOS moved up
inside to contest the pace, dueled inside the runner up turn, weakened when entering the stretch. HOYA PARANOYA went one paced throughout while
racing two to three wide. ULTIMATE popped gate doors prior to the start, broke back, lacked speed, passed tiring rivals while not a serious threat. VICTORY
MARCH pinched back at the start and was not a factor. TOWN BRANCH showed little while racing toward the inside. KNOCKER DOWN fractious in the
gate prior to the start, broke in to help pinch back VICTORY MARCH, was finished early.

Footnotes
KLASSY BRIDGETTE broke with the leaders, confidently handled inside, knifed out three wide when beginning to advance exiting the turn, challenged
between horses past the furlong marker, dueled to the wire, dug in late to narrowly prevail in game fashion. PATE last away, fell further back in trailing,
moved out, ranged up four wide into a challenging position turning for home, bid outside the winner at the furlong marker, dueled to wire with that one,
missed in a solid effort. KEY OF LIFE forwardly placed along the inside, advanced and challenged inside the leader late in the turn, narrowly showed the
way through upper stretch, proved no match late for the top two. ALWAYS ANGELS in the second flight while racing in the two path for a half, came up
empty for the stretch run. STONE SILENT broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch and into the turn in the two path, offered but brief resistance
when confronted from the inside late in the turn then faltered when headed. TWIRLED prompted the issue up front for a half in the three path and had
nothing left for the drive.

Footnotes
PUNCHBOWL bothered break to be last away, unhurried early, swung five wide when beginning to advance exiting the turn, late surge down the middle of
the track to be up in time. UNSUNG MELODY took command after the start, set an unpressured pace into the turn, extended that advantage when
straightened for home, proved no match for the winner late, clearly second best. SACRED WISH broke in to bother the winner, was righted to race in a
forward position inside, shuffled back late backstretch, continued to save ground turn, improved inside of several rival entering the stretch,. had little for the
top two late, clear of the others. BARSTOOL BABE in mid pack and outside, raced four wide through the turn, improved position through the lane while not a
threat to the top three. INTO LOVE forwardly placed just off the inside, chased the runner up through the turn and into the stretch, had little left late to lost
several positions. SHESASMALLTOWNGIRL bobbled at the start, quickly recovered to race closest to the leader up the backstretch, remained forward
through the turn then began to weaken. CECILE forwardly placed while racing three wide, had little left for the stretch run. EXPONENTIAL STAR went one
paced throughout while racing off the inside. I'M SO FUNNY broke back, devoid of any early speed, three wide turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals.
ALLYMISSLOVE raced in the two path, tired form early efforts. CHARLIZE in mid pack for a half while off the inside, backed up through the stretch.
MONTASTICAL broke in, trailed most of the way in showing little.
