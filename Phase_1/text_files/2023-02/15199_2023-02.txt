Footnotes
GRAN MAMIBELLA well placed, closed willingly three wide through the turn, made the lead in upper stretch then widened the balance of the trip to win as
much the best. MYRRH stalked the early pace, loomed boldly between horses two wide nearing the quarter pole then was no match for the winner. MON
PARADIS trailed into the turn, avoided a rival in distress then found her best stride late three wide. SABELLE away alertly, set a pressured pace to the top
of the stretch then weakened. TARA DAWN was no factor. DYNA'S HOLIDAY was no threat. CROSSTOWN GIRL was outrun. WILLYMAR settled mid pack
then lacked the needed response. RAP STAR pressed the early pace along the rail, suffered a catastrophic injury into the turn, pulled up and was
euthanized.

KADESH vied for the lead four then three wide through the turn, drifted in at the top of the stretch, surged late and got up in time two wide. UNYIELDING
pressed the pace along the inside into the stretch, made the lead, set the balance of the pace and just missed hanging on. AGAVE KID set a pressured
pace three then two wide into the stretch, checked when the winner drifted in at the three sixteenths pole then was outfinished. BEACH FRONT failed to
menace. UNION BROTHER offered a mild bid inside rivals into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. AULD LANGE SYNE was no factor. NOBLE
BEHAVIOR had brief speed inside. BULLION pressed the pace two wide into the turn then gave way. THE RIDER OF AGAVE KIKD LODGED A CLAIM OF
FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED KADESH AND PLACED HIM THIRD.

DANCE MOVES away alertly, set the pace into the far turn, drifted out nearing the quarter pole, gave up the lead then came on again late under strong
handling to get back up in time. LITTLE RONS ROCKET never far back, rallied along the inside through the far turn, made the lead at the top of the stretch
then couldn't hold off the winner in the late stages. SMOOCHER was squeezed at the start, trailed for a half, moved up four wide on the far turn and finished
with good courage in the five path. THE GOSPEL OF MARK chased the pace into the far turn, swung wide entering the stretch and lost ground. PLAYING
BALL chased the pace three wide into the far turn, steadied nearing the quarter pole, dropped inside entering the stretch then faded. MUCH TIMES TWO
close up along the inside, swerved at the half mile pole then dropped out of it.
