Footnotes
LEGENDARY GIFT broke well, with the pace from the start, dueled into and through the turn closet to the inside, disposed of that rival into the lane, clear
past the furlong marker of the runner up, held that foe safe late in the late going to prove best. DORITA'S HEART away in good order, stalked the two
leaders off the inside into the turn, three wide for the drive, continued to pursue the winner past midstretch, could do little with that one to the wire, well clear
for the place. HAVE I EVER away in good order, dueled up front off the inside, weakened in the drive, saved the show. LADY SHAMAN went evenly paced
while three out to four wide in the turn, lacked closing punch. MI CRESCENDO lacked speed well out in the strip, four out to five wide late in the turn, failed
to muster a rally. WICKED CHOCOLATE remained back while racing toward the inside. BRIAR THICKET off slowly, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
FETCHS BRAHM forwardly placed toward the inside, advanced to challenge three wide turning for home, took over, steadily clear under pressure. MR.
WULLY BULLY got out into the first turn when back bothering a couple of outer rivals, continued to lack speed, steady advance off the inside second turn,
long drive for the place, outkicked the next rival inside that one while not a threat to the wnner. STORM STRATEGY last away, bothered into the first turn,
moved closer the middle half outside, four wide second turn, outkicked for the runner up spot while remaining outside. CYBERTOWN bothered into the first
turn while off the inside, shuffled back onto the backstretch while continuing in traffic,staged a mild rally to improve position, not a serious threat. DIESEL
FUEL dueled up closest to the inside but in the two path, continued to alternate up the backstretch and into the far turn, disposed of that foe then engaged in
a second duel into the stretch, weakened in the run to the wire. DABOOGEYMAN dropped to the inside first turn, advanced into contention briefly while
continuing to save ground second turn, faltered in the drive. ROSIE'S BOY void of speed, improved position while racing off the inside, never a serious
threat. POINT BLANK bothered into first turn, continued outside, two path second turn, had little left. ACCEL JOE in mid pack and in some traffic through the
first turn between foes, moved out, four wide into the far bend, tired. PREACHER'S PET four wide into the first turn, remained well back throughout. SALTY
JONES dueled in the three path for five furlongs, stopped, jogged in.

home, finished up willingly to be up for the place between horses. OCELOT chased the dueling leaders for a half out in the strip, four wide turning for home,
went evenly through the stretch in lacking a winning response. LIGHTNING STRUCK off a step slow, three wide into the lane when making a mild advance,
continued to improve position slightly while never a serious threat. PRESS SNOOZE back off the pace and the inside, four wide turning for home, failed to
mount a rally while widest down the lane. OTIS OTIS OTIS settled off the pace off the inside, failed to muster a rally. FULL IMPACT dueled up front while

Footnotes
BIGTIME TEGRIDY dueled up front in the two path, continued to alternate into the lane, pulled away steadily the final furlong while being kept to pressure.
KENTUCKY BOURBON broke slowly, void of speed for a half, shifted out to mid track upper stretch, finished willingly to be clear for the place while closing
the gap on the winner. BOURBON ON FIRE in mid pack early while outside, four wide midway on the turn, roused three wide into the lane, could do little
with the winner while proving no match for the runner up late, finished up best of the rest. CONTRABANDISTA lacked speed, behind some traffic late in the
turn, waited briefly then improved when clear for the drive. UNCLE RAY in the second flight while between foes for a half, had little for the drive. KING
DOODLE in the main body while along the inside, continued to save ground turn, failed to mount a bid in the drive. FIVE O FOX broke on top, set or forced
the pace for a half inside the winner, continued to chase upper stretch then faltered the final furlong to lose several positions. KOSELIO tired from between
foes. RUNNIN' BLOCK off a step slow, lacked speed well wide, five path into and through the turn, made little impact while remaining in the middle of the
strip for the drive. CHOWMEIN second flight outside, three wide to four wide turn, tired drive.

Footnotes
BANK within striking distance outside, five wide into the turn when beginning to move closer into the turn, bid, dueled into the stretch, drew off, ridden out.
WOBBERJOD broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch and into the turn, dueled briefly inside the winner into the lane, proved no match for that
one to the wire, clearly second best. BELFAST BOY behind the leaders while along the inside, continued to race inside of horses into the lane, mild late
interest to prove best of the rest, not a threat to the top pair. TILLIS forwardly placed up the backstretch outside, four to five wide late in the turn, lacked a
closing response to be outkicked for the show. COST BASIS in mid pack early while toward the inside, angled out three to four wide into the stretch,
improved slightly. CRIMSON ZIP flashed brief speed off the inside, weakened in the drive. J'S LITTLE MAN off a step slow, raced back in the two path,
passed a few tiring rivals while not a threat. PADDY O'DINI off a step slow, lacked speed, made little impact in the drive while continuing to save ground.
BACKDOORPARTY came in, off slowly, trailed for a half, passed tiring rivals. BEND IN THE RIVER in mid pack while racing outside, three wide through the
turn, failed to rally. ANALYZER bothered, off slowly, remained back. SHACKLEFORD STRONG with the lead group early, began a steady retreat four wide
before a half.

Footnotes
ATKINS moved out when off the pace in the run up the backstretch, three to four wide when beginning to advance late in the turn, finished full of run to win
going away. MEAN TWEETS dwelt at the start to spot the field several lengths, continued back into the turn, moved out for the drive while between foes
exiting the turn, finished willingly to be in time for the place. COLOR FIELD void of speed, also in some traffic exiting the turn outside the runner up,
encountered additional traffic past the furlong marker, could not match strides with MEAN TWEETS to the wire when clear, nod for the show. YACHT ROCK
(IRE) 2nd flight inside early, moved closest to the leader in the two path midway on the turn, took over, clear midstretch, could not contain the top two,
nipped late for the show. THE FIVE B'S broke alertly, cleared toward the inside, continued to show the way through the turn, faltered when headed.
AFRAIDOFTHEBUNNY well out in the strip while off the pace, four to five wide out of the turn, failed to muster a rally. SMOOTH SCAT chased the issue
early while in the three path, four wide when tiring into the stretch, continued to tire to the wire. SALTA in the second flight between horses early, dropped
inside turn, steady fade.

Footnotes
TOUGH LEGACY off slowly, raced well back early as a result, began to advance off the inside far turn, four wide and in traffic when rallying exiting that
bend, slight drift nearing midstretch, continued with good energy to be clearly best at the end. UNSTABLE PRINCESS lacked speed, three to four wide into
the lane when also beginning a rally, widest for the stretch run, finished far out in the strip, up for the place. NO GUILT another who raced off the early pace,
three wide advance through the second turn, put a head in front nearing midstretch after dueling in upper, proved no match for the top two late. ARMY
KITTEN settled off the pace while saving ground through the first turn, continued inside, moved out a bit around a tiring rival early in the final turn, continued
one paced to the end. D'ORO STREET broke alertly, dueled early off the inside, shook clear of the other speed midway on the final turn, dueled with NO
GUILT upper stretch then caved in the final furlong. DIVINELY BOLT in the second flight while racing toward the inside early, had little left for the stretch
run. PEACE CRUISER in the second group off the rail, faltered in the drive. ADIVA broke out to be off a step slow, moved up to race in mid pack outside,
faded through the stretch. GUN RUNNIN GIRL fell back to trail after the start, displayed little interest in remaining back. MOLLY OF STRATFORD dueled up
front for just over five furlongs closest to the inside, stopped far turn.

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED TWISTER away in good order, set the pace toward the inside, two path into the lane, responded when challenged late, turned back that rival
to prevail in determined fashion. KABOOM BABY in mid pack up the backstretch well off the inside, three to four wide turning for home, shifted out to be
widest in the run to the wire, late bid outside the winner, denied. PATTERN BET in the second group inside, moved a bit closer in upper stretch, flattened
out in the final furlong to prove no match for the top two, managed to save the show. RICHNESS pressed the issue outside the winner and between foes,
crept a bit closer in the turn, weakened in the drive and did not have enough late for the show. TOO PRETTY broke alertly, relinquished the early advantage
to the winner, pressed that one three to four wide into and through the turn, also gradually weakened. RUN FEARLESS went one paced throughout while
racing toward the inside. MY DAMS ATITUDE in the main body while racing outside, four wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. LADY ASTRID
made little impact while racing toward the inside. HOT SPRINGS BLING broke with mid pack, shuffled back with a half mile remaining, trailed turn, picked
off a couple of tiring rivals while never a factor. HISSY MISSY was never a factor with a four wide trip. HEATED ARGUMENT off a step slow, in mid pack,
traffic late backstretch, faded.

Footnotes
BACKSIDE BUZZ in the main body toward the inside early, three wide turning for home, finished full of run to win going away. BOLD D'ORO dueled up front
along the inside, shook clear turning for home, proved no match for the winner late, remained clear for the place. TIVY prompted the dueling three wide,
remained in a striking position turning for home, lacked a winning response when asked. APRIL FOOLS ANDY lacked speed outside, four out to five wide
turning for home, staged a mild rally to improve position. BLUES ADMIRAL broke in, dueled up front while racing outside the runner up, first to blink from
that duel, continued to weaken down the stretch. RUNNINGFORCASH in the second group while along the inside, tired. WINNEMAC AVENUE off a step
slow, trailed early as a result, four wide through the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals. WOODY'S CHOICE within striking distance while racing four
wide into and through the turn, tired. NORTHWIND off a step slow, remained always back.
