Footnotes
THE TWINS SNEAKERS raced off the pace in the three path, was coaxed and cued right handed around the turn, fanned out to the seven path into the
lane, rallied and surged past the inner pacesetter just after the eighth pole, and went clear in the final sixteenth. DRUM AND DRUMMER rated in the four
path, was roused in the five path around the turn and ranged up in the six path into the stretch, and kept on under steady urging for place. ASTRAL WEEKS
set the pace along the inside into the turn, was roused while floating out to the three path at the top of the lane, but yielded inside the final furlong to show.
NATURE BOY was a bit keen early while held up from up close in the three path, was coaxed from said position passing the quarter pole, but flattened in
the five path in the stretch. ALLAGASH RUN raced prominently in the two path, was cued to bid passing the three-eighths pole, but faded from the four path
in the stretch. DANLEY had an awkward start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ANGELAS PARTY GIRL set a soft pace along the inside, was roused passing the quarter pole and tipped out to the two path entering the stretch, and dug
in to just hold on. CLOUD STORAGE broke in and bumped an inner foe, chased in the three path, was cued to range up around the far turn, ran on to bid
under right handed urging inside the final furlong, but just missed. ARTIFACT (GB) had her head turned at the start and bumped an outer foe, stalked along
the inside around the first turn and was in the two path down the backstretch, was roused along the inside around the far turn and went back out to the two
path into the lane, and kept on while angling out in the final furlong under right handed urging for show. MAJOR PRYCE raced prominently in the two path
around the first turn and went out to the three path into the backstretch, was cued right handed in the two path midway around the far turn, floated out to the
five path at the top of the stretch, but was one paced. MURSAL rated along the inside, was roused into the far turn and shifted out to the six path into the
stretch, but flattened. MARIANO got bumped badly between foes at the start and stumbled causing the rider to lose his right iron for the first few strides, but
quickly regained the iron and trailed along the inside, was ridden in the two path turning into the stretch, but did not threaten. HARLAN'S LEGACY tracked in
the three path around the first turn and was in the four path down the backstretch, was coaxed in the three path around the far turn and tipped out to the five
path into the stretch, but was empty. AN INQUIRY WAS HELD TO LOOK AT THE START OF MARIANO, NO CHANGES WERE MADE.

GREG'S HONOR settled off the pace three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, tipped six wide near the quarter pole, moved to the front leaving
the eighth pole and edged ahead while ridden out. BACH raced off the pace two wide, advanced between foes down the backstretch and four wide around
the far turn, led through upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. SEBARAY saved ground off the early pace, advanced five wide around the far turn and was
along for the show. I AM RESILIENT failed to menace while racing three and four wide. KRYPTON tracked the pace three wide and faded in the lane.
CAPTURE MI raced closest to the pace in the two path, chased three wide between foes around the far turn and lacked a closing bid. BLUTO'S CANDY
was outrun inside. MORETHANICANHANDLE set the pace off the rail and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
HAY HAY PAULA had a hesitant start and trailed in the two path, tipped out going into the turn and was cued to circle inner foes from the five path into the
stretch, rallied down the center and surged past a pair of inner rivals inside the final sixteenth to win. SPICY GINGER prompted the pace in the four path,
bid in the three path around the turn, took the lead nearing the quarter pole and was cued right handed into the lane, opened up in upper stretch, began to
shorten stride inside the final furlong, and was caught by a late surging outer foe in final strides to place. SOLAIR tracked in the five path, shifted into the
three path around the turn, was driven in the four path into the stretch, and kept on but hung for show. LA COSTA had a rank start, chased in the three path
into the turn but was one paced in the five path going into the stretch. MEET THE BEAUTY pressed in the three path, was ridden in the two path around the
turn and briefly led midturn, but was quickly overtaken before the quarter pole, and faded in the stretch. POLITELY CROWNED rated in the two path into the
turn but was no factor in the three path thru the stretch. BALI BABY stalked along the inside but was never a threat. WITCH OF LOVE set the pace along
the inside but gaveway midway around the turn.

Footnotes
FLAKES raced prominently in the four path, bid passing the three-eighths pole and took the lead passing the quarter pole, was cued to open up while
drifting out to the six path in upper stretch, and held clear while being kept to task. SHERLYN GO GO stalked in the two path, was in the three path around
the turn and ridden from the four path into the lane, ran on between rivals passing the eighth pole, and got up for place. THE MRS rated in the three path,
was roused around the turn and took aim in the five path into the stretch, and kept on but was caught by an outer foe late to finish with show. GUARDIAN
ANGEL dueled for the lead in the two path, took command into the turn, was headed passing the three eighths pole and lost the lead while under a drive
approaching the quarter, and was one paced in the three path thru the stretch. KIKILOVE tracked along the inside, was ridden in the three path around the
turn and floated out to the seven path into the stretch, but was no factor. GIRVIN GIRL dueled for the lead along the inside early but gaveway going into the
turn. ESOTERIC trailed throughout around the center.

Footnotes
MASTEROFTHESENATE settled off the pace while racing two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, closed outside, seized command near the
sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. CHASING RAINBOWS raced in range two wide, advanced two wide around the far turn, took the lead and
quickly cleared in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth pole and fought on inside of the winner. NANTASKET BEACH saved ground off the pace, tipped two
wide near the quarter pole and ran on for the show. MAC'S TIME had his head turned at the start, trailed in the two path early, advanced three wide around
the far turn, angled further out in upper stretch and had a mild rally. STREET VENDOR raced off the pace two wide, went five wide around the far turn and
never threatened. FATHER GLADO played no factor while racing three wide. GUN MAESTRO failed to menace while racing three and four wide. ONE
AMERICA raced in the clear closest to the tearaway leader and came up empty in the lane. HEYMACKIT'SJACK sped off in the four path around the first
turn, angled to the rail while still far in front down the backstretch, led to the quarter pole, stopped and was eased through the lane.
