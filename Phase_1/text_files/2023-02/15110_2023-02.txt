MISS YOU AJAX leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch, remained on his left lead and
rallied. CHELONIAN chased the pace racing in the two path around the turn and weakened through the stretch. BO'S BOURBON bumped ALOTTACENTS
when bearing in leaving the starting gate, quickly sprinted clear, lost the lead in upper stretch and gave way the final furlong. OROCOVIX , three deep on
the turn, moved to the four path in upper stretch and was never a factor. ALOTTACENTS , bumped leaving the starting gate, was outrun. MISS YOU AJAX ,
bumped leaving the starting gate, faltered on the turn.

Footnotes
LEONIDS broke alertly, disputed the pace outside RUFFNER, moved away after that one checked near the three eighths, kept on under under right handed
asking in mid stretch and prevailed. FULL IRISH broke inward and bumped with IRISH RILL, corrected and raced well off the early pace, eased out and
gathered momentum mid turn, edged up behind a rival and stalled briefly nearing the lane, shifted in some to make progress between horses in mid stretch,
altered in further and closed gamely to the inside of the winner. ASSUME NOTHING stalked the dueling leaders, advanced three wide into the stretch, gave
hard chase as the closest pursuer leaving mid stretch, continued on outside the top pair but was out kicked in the final yards. GOODAFTERNOONOSCAR ,
urged along while saving ground, made a bit of a gain into the stretch but lacked a solid finish. MASTERWORK , sluggish from the gate, made a decent four
wide run outside rivals nearing the quarter pole, drifted in some while on his left lead in upper stretch, switched over to his correct lead for the final furlong
and churned on. IRISH RILL , bumped at the break, was hustled along while well back and saving ground, swung out for the drive but failed to respond.
RUFFNER , fractious pre race, came away well and disputed the pace inside the winner, checked when appearing to briefly lose action near the three
eighths, regrouped to chase then faltered in the lane.

LORD UHTRED broke a step slow, quickly recovered and accelerated inside rivals to take command, set a rated pace toward the inside, moved away
heading to the lane, responded when put to stout encouragement in upper stretch, pulled away and was under a steady hand ride through the final
sixteenth. DREAMS DELIVERED , bumped at the break, stalked the winner two to three wide, was under a hustling ride past the five sixteenths and held
well to preserve the place. EL TOLU , bumped at the start, dropped back early while under asking and four wide, swung six wide into the stretch,
straightened and had belated action. SMART AND FAST was angled out early, gave hard chase three to four wide and faded in the final furlong.
SOUTHERN LAD was sent up between horses early, saved ground mid turn, failed to kick on entering the stretch and gave way. HOPE HE'S FAST drifted
in at the break and brushed with EL TOLU, corrected and stalked four wide, lacked a response into the stretch and weakened.

VELVET GHOST prompted the early pace, gained a two wide lead midway down the backstretch, remained off the inner rail around the far turn, opened a
clear advantage in upper stretch and dug in tenaciously the final furlong. GALATIANS , four deep entering the first turn, moved inward mid way on the first
turn, raced in the two path on the far turn, was taken to the three path entering the stretch, took aim on the leader near the eighth pole and flattened out.
MINECRAFTER , three wide both turns, chased the pace to mid stretch then weakened. SASSY KING , bumped and caught in tight quarters leaving the
starting gate, circled foes on the far turn, was fanned four deep at the head of the stretch and gave way. EDDIE'S CHARGE stumbled leaving the starting
gate, trailed to the stretch, raced between horses and passed tired ones. MAMAIGOTTHIS , outrun, was fanned four wide entering the stretch. LORD MIO
stumbled leaving the starting gate, was taken to the inner rail entering the first turn and was not a factor. TITAN'S WILL showed speed along the inner rail
for five furlongs, faltered and was eased.

moved to command after a half mile, spurted clear after being set down in upper stretch, widened a bit past the eighth pole and held firm under a drive. HE
ROLLS took command between rivals and set the pace in the two path, took pressure from both sides past the five sixteenths, wandered outward through
the drive and gave way grudgingly. HERE AND NOFURTHER , bumped and pinched back at the break, regrouped and edged up three wide into the turn,
took closer order approaching the quarter pole, shifted out in the late and closed steadily. SUPE , bumped at the break, drafted back off the early pace while
off the inside, swung six wide in upper stretch and rallied. DOC ROCK prompted the pace along the inside, bid along the rail mid turn, vied into the stretch,
stayed willingly while drifting a bit nearing mid stretch then faded late. ROBBEDINTHEBAHAMAS bobbled at the break, saved ground early, angled out
around the turn, altered back in for the drive but lacked a rally. RIXEY ROCKET lacked speed, raced three wide into the stretch and failed to menace.
NOTIMELIKEPRESENT , four deep chasing the pace, was fanned wider into the stretch and weakened through the final furlong. MR. COWBOY BRADLEY
flashed speed outside foes, dropped in past the five eighths, chased and gave way. TEGO was outrun. Following a stewards' inquiry and objection by the
rider of HERE AND NOFURTHER, LUV YA BYE BYE was disqualified from first and placed third for causing interference leaving the starting gate

Footnotes
BADGER TOOTH rated forwardly four wide early on, edged up and bid three deep in hand nearing the half mile marker, responded when asked and shook
clear of rivals leaving the five sixteenths, kept on under right handed encouragement and held firm. NEVER CHANGE , in range and outside a rival, edged
up leaving the five sixteenths, angled four wide to take aim outside the winner into the stretch, gave willing chase from there but was kept at bay through the
final furlong. CASH KID tracked towards the inside, steadied nearing the half mile marker then dropped back some, angled out under pressure past the five
sixteenths, came five wide into the lane, worked between runners and came back on. ICE BAR broke slowly, settled off the rail, moved up past the five
eighths, angled six wide into the stretch but lacked a serious finish. SHADY MUNNI disputed the early pace between foes, eased back heading to the half,
dropped in and faded. MR. MOSLEY vied inside rivals, stayed on past the five sixteenths then gave way in upper stretch. TYLER TIME bobbled after the
break, pressed three deep around the first turn, battled between runners leaving the half, failed to go on entering the lane and retreated.
