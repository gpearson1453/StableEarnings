end. BETYAR AZETS chased the pace while three wide into the backstretch, then was slowly moving up to menace on the second turn into the stretch but it
was not enough to catch the leader. TRICKSKI'S GOLD was allowed to settle while tracking the pace while four wide down the backstretch, then rallied
entering the far turn to close well for show. UTSIRA was bumped at the start then chased the pace from the inside on the backstretch, was in tight, then
steadied at the five sixteenths, then rebid entering the stretch drive to close willingly in the end. PURRFECT MOON chased the pace while two wide down
the backstretch, bid along the rail on the second turn, then flattened out in the stretch. TALE OF ATREIDES bumped inner rival at the start then trailed
behind the field throughout the course and needed more.
