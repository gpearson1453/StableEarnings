Footnotes
BERTIE'S CAUSE floated out at the break, remained well back into the turn, advanced in the two path around the bend, switched to the far outside for room
approaching the furlong marker, late surge to be up at the wire. CHARTREUSE broke out to carry out the winner a bit, vied early inside, fell back in the run
through the turn, steered out in mid stretch, rebid late between foes, could not match the winner late to miss. FABULOUS FANNY pressed the issue up the
backstretch in the three path, vied into the stretch in the two path, took over with a furlong remaining, gave ground grudgingly to the top pair in the waning
strides. STAY FABULOUS broke on top, narrowly set the early pace in the two path and between horses, continued to vie through the turn, dueled through
upper stretch, gradually weakened the final furlong. SINGING EMMA behind the first flight in the two path, came three wide for the drive, lacked a closing
response. TIZ SWEET CANDY forwardly placed early outside, moved to challenge five to four wide turn, held a slight edge late in the turn then hung in the
drive. SODDY DAISY back off the pace, three wide trip, failed to rally. LITTLEDABWILLDOO in a bit tight just after the start, void of speed, saved ground to
no avail. DESTINY'S DREAM fractious loading, broke with the field, raced in mid pack early while four wide, through before a half, trailed home.

Footnotes
JOLLY TOMMY steered out to be three wide in the second flight first turn, stalked the pace in the run up the backstretch, challenged while remaining in the
three path midway on the second bend, kicked clear through the lane under steady handling. GET THROUGH last away, lacked early speed, moved closer
along the inside second turn, came in the two path for the drive, finished willingly to be clear for the place, no match for the winner. TREATY broke in good
order, showed the way first turn, continued to set a modest pace in the run up the backstretch, offered brief resistance to the winner in the second turn, no
match for that one or the runner up the final furlong, remained clear of the others. BROOKLYN DIAMONDS lacked early speed, remained back off the soft
pace into the far turn, three wide for the drive, passed tiring rivals while not a threat to the top three. MR CREED broke well from the outside, dropped inside
to save ground first turn, second flight second bend, three wide for the drive, came up empty. HAPPY BOY ROCKET void of speed, four wide in the final
turn, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. PITTSBURGH pressed the leader through those soft fractions, challenged between horses and
inside the winner midway on the second turn, gave way.

VYING EDGE bothered at the break, raced in mid pack up the backstretch, four wide when advancing late in the turn, bid past the furlong marker, drew well
clear under steady handling. CAMPISI also was bothered at the start, quickly recovered to race within striking distance up the backstretch in the three path,
challenged on the outside midway on the bend, led, proved no match for the winner late, remained clear for the place. TOAST TO COAST behind the early
pace along the inside, continued to save ground turn, staged a mild rally up the rail to annex the show. FINBARFUREY broke back, lacked speed for a half,
steered out sharply to be five wide into the lane, improved position down the middle of the strip without posing a serious threat. HARDSCRABBLE broke
outward but forwardly, raced in the second flight toward the inside, came up empty for the drive. MR WORKS bobbled at the break, raced back and outside,
four wide through the turn, improved a bit while also not posing a serious threat. HE'S RICH broke alertly, narrowly set the pace for a half along the inside
then tired through the stretch. RIANTE SKY bothered at the start to break back, trailed for a half, improved position by picking off mostly tiring rivals after the
issue had been decided. MY KINDA TETON broke in, bumped start, raced in mid pack for a half then tired in the drive. IMPOVERISHED broke in to bother
a couple of inner rivals, was straightened to press the issue for a half off the inside and then gave way. JUST BECAUSE off a step slow, remained always
back to be outrun. LOUD BOY pinched back at the start, raced back and three wide, moved to the inside and faded badly down the lane.

Footnotes
TRAVERSE forwardly placed past the wire the first time inside, moved out to track the leader, advanced on that one and challenged in the three path turning
for home, set down with a furlong to run, drove clear. QUEENS UP within striking distance in the second flight outside, three to four wide turning for home,
set down for the drive, late bid for the place while widest of the second flight, proved determined to gain that position late. RICHEBOURG moved up to set
the pace outside the winner early, rated in the run up the backstretch, called on for some run when that same foe came calling in the second bend, proved
no match for that one the final furlong, proved stubborn for the second spot while between horses at the wire. IT'SFIFTYSHADETIME settled behind the
pace inside, moved closer late in the second turn along the rail, challenged into the stretch, flattened out in the final furlong, not enough for the place or the
show. FOREVER DREAMING lacked speed while racing outside, dropped in midway on the final turn, came up empty for the stretch run. FAMILY TIME off
a step slow, pulled while trailing onto the backstretch, three wide into the stretch, also lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
DERBY DAY LASSIE broke alertly, soon sprinted well clear, continued to hold a large lead through the turn and into the stretch, roused late, just enough left
to hold off the next two at the wire. K J'S PISTOL ANNIE in the second flight early outside, four down to three wide into the turn, set down on the outside for
the drive, finished well to be rapidly closing the gap on the winner while between horses at the wire. BETTY JO in mid pack and outside, three wide through
most of the turn, came four wide for the drive, also was quickly closing the gap on the winner while widest of the first flight at the wire, not enough 2nd.
GUEST IN MY HEART lacked early foot, two path turn, improved position through the lane, not a serious threat to the top three. MISS RITA raced behind
the pace inside, saved ground turn, traffic late in the bend, moved out three wide for the drive and went flat through the lane. JERI DAWN off a step slow,
raced back and inside, also angled out three wide turning for home, improved position. SWEETNESS TO settled in mid pack and inside, continued to save
ground turn, one paced through the stretch in lacking a closing kick. MISS DUTTON off a step slow, moved inside late in the turn, steered back out to be
widest through the stretch, improved by passing tiring rivals. SHE'S HAMAZING lacked speed while three wide, failed to respond when called on for the
drive. NAVAGATIONALBEACON in the second flight early while between foes, took over in some traffic entering the turn, recovered to finish the turn in the
four path, tired through the stretch. LITTLE ROCKER chased the winner early and gave way after a half. BIG ON BROADWAY trailed throughout in showing
little.

Footnotes
WHISKEY BLUE never far back outside, ranged up to challenge three wide midway on the final turn, clear into the stretch, held the runner up safe late
under steady handling. SANTANGELO settled off the pace while moving just off the inside late in the first turn, continued to track up the backstretch, closer
in some traffic late in the final turn, steered out and came three wide and between rivals for the drive, finished willingly to be slowly getting to the winner late,
clearly second best. BIG JAVA in mid pack while racing off the inside, four out to five wide turning for home, rallied for the show, no match for the top pair.
KANCANCUTIE pressed the issue early from along the inside, dueled up the backstretch and into the far turn, gradually weakened to lose a couple of
positions down the stretch. SHIP IT off the pace,, moved closer four wide turning for home outside the runner up, weakened in the run to the wire.
GRAYDAWN DAY broke alertly, narrowly set the pace for almost six furlongs in the two path, faltered from between horses. LANDSLID went one paced
throughout while racing exclusively in the three path. LADY ENVOY remained always back while racing toward the inside. EXPENSIVE LIAISON void of
early foot in trailing, was always outrun. MARTIQUE MISS four wide through the first turn, was finished after a half.

PROFOUND IMPACT broke in to tighten up inner rivals, quickly was straightened and sprinted clear into the first turn, held a sizable advantage up the
backstretch through a quick opening quarter, continued to hold daylight through the final turn, enough left to hold on late. SOUTHERN SUNSET bit tight
start, in mid pack just off the inside early, advanced second turn while in the two path, moved out, set down, lugged in late to bother THE BOOKKEEPER,
narrowly outfinished that one. THE BOOKKEEPER in traffic into the first turn, settled in the run up the backstretch, made a good gain along the inside to
reach closest to the winner late in the final turn, chased that one past the furlong marker, bothered when SOUTHERN SUNSET lugged in a sixteenth out,
caught late by that one. ETERNALLY GRATEFUL in a bit tight at the start to be last away, raced back, four out to five wide midway on the turn when
beginning a mild advance, continued with some modest interest to the end to improve position, not a serious threat. HARD TO COME BY in a bit tight at the
break as well, also lacked any early foot, moved toward the inside late in the final turn, improved position as well with some mild energy late. DISCOVERY
PEAK in the second flight closest to the inside, had little left for the drive. RACHEL'S CAPER went one paced while racing off the inside. PROCHARGER
remained back while racing outside. PINE COVE in the second flight outside, stopped four wide far turn, jogged in. LEOLA traffic into the first turn, headed
up the second group for a half, also stopped and was jogged in. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP
STRETCH, SOUTHERN SUNSET WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR INTERFERENCE AND PLACED THIRD.

Footnotes
PARODY a bit unruly loading, broke well, dueled in the three path outside the other speed, continued to alternate into the stretch, slowly edged clear under
firm handling late. VIOLENT POINT broke alertly, set or forced the issue inside the winner for five furlongs, could not hand with that one late while remaining
along the rail, held the place while fully extended. PISTOL chased the dueling leaders inside, angled out a bit and came in the two path for the drive, shifted
out a bit wider when straightened for home and was getting to the runner up late. LI'L GRAZEN lacked early foot outside, three to four wide turning into the
lane, displayed a mild amount of late interest to improve position. SHESABIDFORMIDABLE last away, fell further back up the backstretch while dropping
inside, improved inside of several rivals into the stretch, not a serious threat late. HARTLEY in the second flight outside, four down to three wide turn, had
little left for the stretch run. COST A FORTUNE was finished after three furlongs while racing off the inside. ADRIA was done early after racing wide into the
turn.

Footnotes
JUBELLA taken in hand after the start to settle behind the pace, moved at will while three wide second turn, quickly took over late in that that bend and was
clear into the lane, held the runner up late late under steady handling. LOFTHOUSE closest to the leader after racing three wide into the first turn, continued
to pursue into the far bend, challenged inside the winner and between foes late in the second turn, fell back off that foe into the lane and managed little in
the way of any late gain, clearly second best. MISTY VEIL off a step slow, raced five down to four wide first turn when back, four wide again far bend when
making a mild move, chased the top two home without making much of an inroad on either. TIPSY GAL took command soon after the start, showed the way
up the backstretch while rating, weakened when headed by the top pair midway on the final turn. RIGHT TRAPPE three wide first turn when off the pace,
continued outside and was four wide into the stretch, went evenly through the lane in lacking a late punch. GIANNA'S GIFT went one paced while racing
toward the inside, lacked closing response. BOBBIN TAIL off a step slow, four wide through the first turn, never menaced while off the inside. BLESSED
AGAIN in mid pack and toward the inside, began to fade after five furlongs. EMITYAAZ four wide when back off the pace into the first turn, was finished
before four furlongs.
