SEVENTY SEVENTYCAT hit the gate leaving it, saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, challenged from the
rail coming around the second bend and drew off in the stretch. EXCHEQUER raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on
the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the far bend and chased the winner home from there. IT'S FATE
raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the second turn and was
outkicked in the stretch but kept on to the wire. ODDS ON reared up leaving the gate, trailed the field from the two path through the opening half mile,
moved up while racing in the four path around the far turn and never threatened. PRIVATE LAKE saved ground early, raced in the middle of the pack on the
inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and was empty in the stretch. CHILL HAZE raced in the two path around the
first bend, led the way on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the second turn and tired further in the lane.

on the inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground late.
FAST N STEADY raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, began to move up while racing in the
three path around the second turn and continued to improve position in the lane. BOURBON BROWN raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through
the opening half mile, began a bid from the two path coming around the far turn and flattened out in the final furlong. HOLY MEISTER hopped up leaving the
gate, raced at the back of the pack on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, saved ground around the second bend and never threatened.
LAST SECOND LOUIE raced in the two path early, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the three
path and was never a threat. EDMUND FITZGERALD saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, dropped back while racing inside
around the far bend and tired further in the stretch. GUNMAN chased the leader from the two path through the opening half mile, came around the far turn
still in the two path and faded in the lane. SHIPWRECK trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, saved ground around
the far turn and was never a factor.
