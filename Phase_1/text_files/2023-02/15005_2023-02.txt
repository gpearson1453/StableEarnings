Footnotes
CASH ROCKET settled off the early pace inside, closer while continuing to save ground before a half, tracked into the far turn, steered three wide late in
that bend when beginning to advance, challenged three wide and outside when straightened for home, kicked strongly clear, geared down late to win ridden
out. EGO broke back, moved off the inside, four wide into the far turn, made a good gain to challenge in the three path midway on the bend, vied briefly
between rivals and inside the winner into the stretch, proved no match for that one in the run to the wire, well clear of the others. CATHOLIC GUILT broke
on top, cleared to the inside into the first turn, set the pace along the inside, responded when the runner up came alongside midway on the final turn, proved
no match for that one or the winner through the lane, remained clear of the others. EGOMANIAC lacked early foot along the inside, raced behind traffic into
the final turn to wait briefly, came in the two path for the drive, improved slightly in upper stretch then finished evenly while never posing a serious threat.
MAKE NOISE broke back, was used a bit to move into a forward position past the wire the first time, pressed the issue the issue onto the backstretch,
remained closet to the leader until just under three furlongs remained and began to weaken. SPARK (PER) in the second flight in the two path first turn, fell
back in the run up the backstretch, had little for the drive. FLOWERS FOR LISA four wide into the first turn, continued outside, four wide again late in the
second, retreated to trail home.

Footnotes
BONES AND ROSES off a step slow, trailed up the backstretch inside, continued to save ground turn when beginning to advance, cut the corner into the
stretch to improve position significantly, continued that advance to challenge inside the leader with under a furlong to run, drew clear under steady handling.
KEEN CONTENDER also devoid of early foot, raced on the outside when well back far turn, fanned five to six wide into the stretch, finished willingly down
the middle of the strip to be clear for the place. FINISHWHATUSTARTED cleared toward the inside before a furlong, continued to show the way through the
turn toward the inside, offered little resistance to the winner inside the furlong marker, could not contain the runner up, narrowly managed to save the show.
SWEET HOLINESS back off the pace well out in the strip, moved closer four wide late in the bend, failed to sustain that advance in the drive, outkicked for
the show spot. SHEZA CAT lacked early foot, angled four to five wide turning for home, lacked a closing kick. I GUESS NOT behind the pace in the two
path, brief wait in traffic with four furlongs to run, additional traffic late in the turn, also failed to produce a late response. MRS. MACOMBER forwardly
placed along the inside, had little for the drive. FIRST FROST moved closer in the three path turn, backed up through the stretch. STEPONTHEFOOTFEET
chased the leader for a half in the two path and stopped.

Footnotes
SISAWAY NOW forwardly placed early toward the rail, steered out when moving to challenge three wide late in the turn, took over, clear past the furlong
marker, held late under steady handling. MARK THE MOOSE bumped at the break to be last away, raced back and inside, continued to save ground into
the stretch, traffic, altered course midstretch, finished willingly to earn the place when clear. MY NOAH bumped with the runner up at the break, two path
into the turn, waited behind a wall of horses turning for home, roused, not enough for the place while between horses. COLE SPUR forwardly placed off the
inside, three to four wide turning for home when within striking position, lacked a late punch to be outside for the second spot. NEW DICE lacked speed
inside, came in the two path for the drive, improved slightly without posing a serious threat. FREER moved outside, raced four out to five wide through the
turn, lacked the needed closing response. G T THREE FIFTY unruly prior to the start, broke alertly, dueled for a half along the inside, faltered through the
stretch. SKYLINE raced in mid pack and outside, four wide exiting the turn, remained back. DEL MOON void of speed off the inside, also failed to mount a
rally. UPTOWN HUSTLER dueled up front outside in the run up the backstretch, continued to battle through the turn in the two path, gave from between
foes upper stretch.

Footnotes
ROYAL KING away well from along the inside, set the pace toward the inside up the backstretch and into the turn, came in the two path when confronted
exiting the bend, dueled past the furlong marker, edged clear again late under firm handling. RUNAWAY JACK off slowly, was used to move into a forward
position by late backstretch, saved ground turn, switched out when straightened for home, closed well to be coming for the winner late while up for the place
in the final stride. GLOBAL STAGE forwardly placed off the inside, advanced to challenge three wide turning for home, dueled through upper stretch,
weakened late, caught for the place. PLAUSIBLE DENILE fell back to trail after the start, shuffled back from between horses into turn, two path through the
bend, lacked a closing kick. BOLZY made little impact while racing three wide through the turn. TULSAN in the second flight while racing three wide, had
little for the stretch run. GOLD BARON behind the pace along the inside, in tight along the rail late in the turn, unseated rider. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY REGARDING THE INCIDENT LATE IN THE TURN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
DEVIL'S TOWER broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch under pressure, held a narrow advantage late in the turn while in the two path, shrugged
off that rival in upper stretch and steadily drew out while being kept to task. TIZHOTNDUSTY in the second flight while along the inside, continued to save
ground turn, could do little with the winner late, held the second spot while also kept to pressure. EMERALD EXPRESS bobbled, broke in to bump JERRY'S
EIGHTY, raced back and out in the strip, four wide through the turn, lost ground to the runner up turning into the stretch, getting to that one late while also
not a threat to the winner. TAPIT'S SPIRIT in mid pack while outside, three wide through the turn, went evenly through the stretch while unable to muster
any late gain. LOST IN LIMBO forwardly placed outside, dueled in the three path outside the winner through the lane, faltered in the drive. DILETTANTE in
mid pack while racing along the inside, asked along late in the turn, failed to muster a response. JERRY'S EIGHTY bumped at the start to be off slow,
remained always back. CATHEDRAL BEACH in mid pack early, began a steady fade in the two path before a half.

Footnotes
LINE TO GAIN pushed in at the break to be off a bit slow, unhurried toward rail, asked second turn, swung out five wide when advancing turning for home,
engaged the leader from the outside inside the furlong grounds and wore that rival down. RANSAM PAYNTER took command soon after breaking in good
order, set the pace in the two path, shook off an inside bid late backstretch, clear again, responded when the winner came alongside with less than a furlong
remaining, gave ground grudgingly to that rival, remained well clear for the place. COMMANDER REX broke in, was straightened and settled behind the
runner up toward the inside, remained within striking distance in the two path second bend, lacked a winning response in the drive. EIGHT STRAIGHT in
mid pack while racing outside, four wide through the final turn, also found lacking when the real running began at the head of the lane. GONE AGAIN four
wide into the first turn, steadied late in that bend after moving closer, dropped inside second turn, brief wait into the lane, went one paced to the wire when
clear. THINKINGNDRINKING pinched back at the start to break slow, trailed then got out when rank into the first turn, remained well back, four wide into the
stretch, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. SANTINO'S FANTASY prompted the runner up for five furlongs in the three path
and then gave way. FRIDAYNIGHTSOLDIER four wide into the first turn, failed to menace. UPTOWN SOCIAL used early in some traffic first turn to
advance while dropping to the inside, pressed the issue from along the rail for the next half mile and then stopped for the drive.

Footnotes
SAQEEL in some traffic in the second flight into the first turn, tracked the leader inside the middle half, steered out under encouragement late in the final
turn, engaged the leader past the furlong marker and kicked clear. PRODIGIOUS BAY broke on top, set the pace toward the inside while in hand, clear far
turn and into the stretch, offered brief resistance to the winner a furlong out then proved no match. SONO GRATO off a step slow, raced unhurried toward
the inside, steered out for the drive, mild interest to prove best of the rest. ICE BLAST bothered to be off slowly, trailed early, traffic far turn, steered out and
came four wide for the drive, improved position. SIMOVITCH pressed the runner up to that one's outside, floated out to be four wide into the lane when
beginning to tire, continued to weaken in the run to the wire. DINNER AT CRUMPIES broke in, traffic into the first turn in the second flight, finished after half.
RVINDICATED jostled between horses into the first turn, stopped late in the final turn, jogged in.

Footnotes
CAMP DAVID pressed the leader to that one's outside, dueled into the far turn, took over turning for home, drew away under steady handling. MR.
THUNDERSTRUCK lacked early foot, continued to be outrun into the final turn, asked along in the three path inside of several rivals turning for home, long
drive for the place, proved determined for that position while between horses. AMONGST FRIENDS settled off the pace and the inside, raced in the two
path final turn, angled out to be four wide into the lane while briefly dropping inside reign, outfinished for the place while widest of the second flight at the
wire. EFFICIENCY showed the way into the first turn, set the pace in the two path, dueled inside the winner into and through the second turn, could not keep
up with that one the final furlong, caught late for the place. BARBER ROAD last to leave, void of speed in trailing much of the way, two path into the lane,
found best stride too late through traffic, galloped out strongly. TONKA WARRIOR settled in the second flight outside, continued off the inside final turn,
carried out six wide into the stretch, lacked rally. IGNITIS within striking distance, four out to five wide exiting the final turn, had little left in the run to the wire.
CHILENO in mid pack while racing along the inside, continued to save ground to no avail through the final turn. CATDADDY back early, improved up to mid
pack on the outside before a half, fanned seven wide into the stretch, faded.

Footnotes
CANDY CARAMEL moved up to secure early position along the inside, shuffled back when lacking room into the turn, remained in traffic late in the bend,
steered out to bump a tiring THORN CROWN when straightened for home, was righted and finished with good resolve to be edging clear. BIOGENIC BABE
in the second flight while between horses, came three wide for the drive when taking over, clear past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner,
clearly second best. COLLECTED GLORY in mid pack while racing outside, four to five wide turning for home, staged a mild rally to annex the show, no
threat to the top two late. INSENSITIVE one paced while racing off the inside, four wide into the stretch, lacked a closing kick. LOVELY JOYCE off a step
slow, well back early, four wide into the stretch, improved position with some belated interest out in the strip. SHE BE SHEEHAN lacked speed while moving
toward the inside, remained in the two path turn, passed a couple of tiring rivals while not a threat. I'M BETH DUTTON broke on top, soon clear, set the
pace for a half, gave way when headed by the runner up turning for home. THORN CROWN in the second flight outside, continued to race forwardly three
to four wide turning for home, was beginning to tire bumped by the winner in upper stretch, continued to weaken to the wire. PLUS POWER balked at
loading, dwelt at the break, trailed throughout and was never involved.
