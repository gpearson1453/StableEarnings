Footnotes
I WIN LIKA GIRL set a pressured early pace, drifted out six wide through the turn, lost the lead, re-rallied, regained the lead late stretch and edged clear for
the win. BELLA Y SOFIA was in mid pack early, raced five wide into the turn, angled in through the stretch and finished second best. PASSION BELLE was
void of any early speed, advanced ten wide through the turn, was closing late and needed more ground. I GET STORMED was outrun early, angled in
through the rive and finished evenly late. SHOULDABEENACOWGAL was allowed to settle from the inside, took a brief lead, drifted in and weakened late.
EVANGELINA WHO was reserved early from between rivals and offered no late rally. MISS ABILITY was taken back early, raced eight wide and passed
tired rivals. TURN ON ARCH tracked the early pace, raced eight wide and was empty. SHEZACONSTANTSONG pressed the early pace, went seven wide
and tired. RELEASE THE GENIE was unhurried early and was no factor. REBEL RYETTE was reserved early and offered no impact.

DOER NOT A FAKER set a pressured early pace, raced four wide through the turns, met the bid of HANNAH'S HIGHLITE, shook clear from that rival and
held off the rally of CRAFTY MONEY for the win. CRAFTY MONEY tracked the early pace, raced six wide through the second turn, was gaining late and
finished second best. PANDORA WHO was allowed to settle early, raced eight wide through the second turn and was along for third. BELLAMUNDO
stumbled at the start, was reserved early, angled out to the seven path in the drive and flattened out. HANNAH'S HIGHLIFE stalked the early pace, raced off
the rail into the home turn, angled to the inside through the turn, made a bid on the winner, couldn't sustain the run and was empty late. MISS FLUFFY
pressed the early pace, raced five wide into the second turn and faded.
