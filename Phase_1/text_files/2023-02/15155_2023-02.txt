Footnotes
PI YO PRINCESS was just off the pace early, matched strides with the leader after the half mile pole, was set down for the drive after the quarter pole and
out lasted the competition. GURKHA GOLD (IRE) sent for the rail early and set the pace, was pressured by another rival by the half, matched strides
through the turn and down the lane but gave way late. TEXAS TIDELANDS settled a few lengths off the leaders early, traveled in company with a another
competitor down the backside, this set moved up behind the leaders going into the turn, made a move at the quarter pole but just missed. CAVIAR
RESOLUTION traveled in a set from the three path behind the leaders, flattened out at the quarter pole. HONORARY GUEST chased the leaders early and
never really got involved.

Footnotes
GO BROTHER GO settled three deep, made a sweeping move through the second turn, came to level terms once straightened for the drive. was kept to
task and kicked away through the final furlong. TRADER PRICE was nearest the pace off of the inside, bid between rivals leaving the second turn,
continued on willingly but was unable to go on with the winner late. IRON N STEEL opened clear to dictate terms, was collared leaving the second turn,
gave in but stayed on to preserve the minor award. OUR HEATSEEKER attended the pace toward the inside, shifted out to make a mild bid between foes
going into the second turn, but failed to sustain the drive. DOUBLE ON THE RED was allowed to settle near the inside, angled out but lacked a response
when called upon. RUN ON ACES was unhurried into stride, tucked in to save ground, but was never a factor. RENATI went wide, came up empty before
going six furlongs, dropped well back and was distanced through the stretch.

Footnotes
MOUNT KENYA was allowed to settle from the three path early in the race was moved up to join the second tier of horses around the half mile marker, was
in contention from the outside at the quarter pole, battled in three way battle for half of the stretch, then battled with one other foe down to the wire and got
the head nod. MOTOWN MISSILE set the early pace from the rail, was challenged in the second turn by two other foes, dug in for the drive, shook one of
the challengers at the eighth pole, kept on battling with an outside foe was game but lost the nod today. SEEKING SPLENDOR settled off the pace early,
moved up at the half mile pole, challenged for the lead at the quarter pole and stopped. IZEONDEC was off a step slow, had a rail trip but was never
involved. MAJOR DEAL got in tight going into the first turn, bounced of the rail and showed little after that. MASQUERADE BALL was three wide through the
first turn, gained ground on the leader and hooked company by the five eighths, was in between horses at the half and faltered. KING TUFF was in tight in
the first turn, clipped heels with another foe and went wrong.

Footnotes
RAMMER JAMMER set the pressured pace along the inside, shook clear entering the stretch and widened. ACTION SEEKER tracked the leaders along the
inside, moved into striking distance leaving the turn, angled out and took dead aim entering the stretch, but was unable to bridge the gap. CAT FIVE settled
saving ground, took closer order on the turn, shifted out into the lane and churned on to earn the minor award. G'S LAW was unhurried along the inside, got
through and improved position. FASTNFURIOUS disputed the pace outside the winner, weakened after a half, drifted out some into the stretch and gave
way. LET'S GO RANDOM stalked three wide, moved up four wide to make a mild bid, was fanned wider still leaving the turn and faded. UNAFFILIATED
was through early. HE IS WORTHY broke slow and was always outrun.

Footnotes
ANDERS SMILE was sent out for the lead, showed the way from the rail and got to the wire first. CAJUN CONNECTION bobbled at the start ,settled a few
lengths off the leaders early, was in contention in the turn, ran flat. PESO PESADO trailed early from the outside, moved up just off the leader at the half,
was five wide was within striking distance at the quarter pole but never fired. SYVESTAR was off the pace early, stayed along the rail was accompanied by
two other competitors at the half, where he lugged out pushing the horse next to him into the horse on the far out side causing the to loose their strides
continued to race along the rail down the lane where he finished flat. IRON MOON was wide early, moved up into contention around the half mile marker,
was jostled around by another foe, raced further on while still wide and retreated after the quarter pole. HARPES HILL vied for the lead early, settled for
second tier in the first turn on the outside, shuffled back, where he was 2W, moved in contention at the half mile marker in between horses, was bumped by
a foe on the inside, was eased in the lane and walked off. AFTER A STEWART'S INQUIRY INVOVING SYVESTAR, HARPERS HILL AND IRON MOON,
THE STEWART FOUND THAT SYVESTAR INERFERRED WITH BOTH HARPERS HILL AND IRON MOON AND WAS DISQSUALIFIED AND PLACED
SIXTH.

Footnotes
COPTER attended the pace along the inside, shifted out leaving the turn, forged command four wide, dug in and maintained a diminishing advantage.
LORDY LORDY was hustled along between foes, came five wide, kicked on well but was unable to reach the winner. HOOSIER was slow into stride, swung
to the outside entering the stretch, finished well and was making up ground with every stride. CLEAR AS A BELE broke a step slow, tucked in to save
ground, ranged into contention through the turn, was stymied in traffic a quarter out, got through between rivals and continued on willingly. CALICOCO was
allowed to settle, advanced between foes into the lane, but failed to make serious headway. SONO came away in good order, was allowed to settle while
wide, weakened leaving the turn and faded. BLINDEDBYTHEGEES contested the pace along the inside, disputed the issue to the final furlong and
succumbed. GEAUX SUGAR vied for the lead outside, was collared between horses entering the stretch and gave way readily.

Footnotes
PERRINS was unhurried into stride, tucked in to save ground, came under a ride with three furlongs to run, ranged into striking position on the second turn,
split rivals entering the stretch, struck the front and quickly drew clear. ONEFORVIVI pressed the pace outside, forged command entering the stretch, kept
on well but was no match for the winner. SCORING DRIVE stalked the pace toward the inside, shifted out entering the stretch, loomed a danger but lacked
the needed late response. MOMENT OF STARDOM settled in hand, angled out five wide to make his bid, but failed to make headway through the drive.
BOULDERING was allowed to settle, came five wide, angled inward in traffic but went evenly. NORTHERNREFLECTION contended between horses to the
second turn and tired. WESTERN STAR set the pressured pace along the inside through the second turn and dropped out. OLE STUD MUFFIN went wide
and was never a factor.

Footnotes
DUXONTHEPOND was allowed to settle, launched a looping move five wide, reeled in the leader and was up in the final strides. BET ON BOURBON set
the pressured pace outside, opened clear on the turn, dug in and fought on but was unable to resist the winner. ALLSTAR MAGIC prompted the pace
toward the inside, dropped off of the leader on the turn, shifted out and came again entering the stretch, made a mild bid but failed to sustain the drive.
RYAN'S GRACE was unhurried along the inside, got through and finished willingly. SWIRLING WINE was close up three wide between horses to the stretch
and gave in. HAPPY SAILS was allowed to settle, came four wide and finished with a belated improvement. MISS DISTINCTIVE was forwardly placed along
the inside for a half and retreated. STOP SHOP N DROP settled between horses but lacked a response when called upon.
