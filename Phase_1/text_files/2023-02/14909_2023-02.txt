faltered late going. C F V WICKED RED outside run to far turn, shoved on, no response, evenly stretch. CAN'T HIDE FROM ME never a real menace.

AUNT BECCA quick to the front, stayed well to the stretch while all out to wire and lasted under stout handling. SHE'S ON THE ROCKS chased winner
throughout with a late stretch kick, gamely to the wire but missed. MISCHIEVOUS DOLL good position never far back to stretch and no match for top pair.
JENNY LIND void of speed to turn, rallied along to improve in the stretch run. MISS J D tracked to pair to the stretch, could not go on, evenly late. ROLO
BOLO slow break, raced along to stretch, angled in sharply with no gain. ANA slow from the gate, never menced thereafter. DONA WITCH antsy in gate,
broke well, close up early on outside, stopped. DELOVELY dropped back quickly at the start and never recovered. STELLAR LEGACY in tight behind a wall
off horses early, kept going backwards. PITTORE D'ORO very reluctant to load, never menaced when the gate sprung. WILL VIRGINIA DARE failed to
menace.

angled out four wide but leveled off in the stretch run with no gain. BEACH KITTEN speed to the front, led to the stretch, could not go on and faded. EASY
IS GOOD close up inside, shuffled back at the half, raced on evenly turn. WILMORE had an awkward start, never menaced thereafter. FORGOT
PASSWORD well off rail trip while never a factor throughout. GORILLA GIRL was anxious in gate, no speed while far back down the backstretch and only
improved slightly. TOTAL DISCRETION good position to the half with a steady fade back thereafter. KNELCOCK tracked leader outside to the half, dropped
far back thereafter.
