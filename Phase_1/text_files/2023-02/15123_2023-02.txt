Footnotes
ROCK ROSE set the pace along the inner rail, opened up turning for home and was kept to her business late. BELLA BETTINA , patiently handled down the
backstretch, circled foes on the turn, moved to the five path turning for home and had a mild rally outside horses. OFFALY FAST , two wide around the turn,
chased the winner to upper stretch and tired. SWEET TALIA , under urging three wide entering the turn, remained well off the rail there after and failed to
rally. FANCY PRINCESS , a forward factor along the inner rail on the turn, swung outside approaching the stretch and weakened. VILLAREGGIA , along the
inner rail most of the race, was not a factor.

Footnotes
CLUBMAN astutely maneuvered to the rail early on and settled off of a contested pace, crept up along the rail into the far turn, slipped through to the inside
of a rival to continue progress past the five sixteenths, eased out three wide and under a ride into the lane, closed in determinedly under solid handling,
reeled in the leader with a sixteenth to go and drew clear late. VISUAL ARTIST set a pressured pace along the inside, shook clear around the far turn,
maintained a clear advantage under asking into the stretch, came off the rail a bit, dug in when confronted approaching the sixteenth marker then gave way
grudgingly. WALK AWAY JOE , three to four wide and forwardly placed behind rivals, shifted in through the drive and churned on to nab the show. UP
AGAINST IT , five wide into the first turn to reach contention, was hung out four wide outside rivals stalking into the far tun, came five wide under a ride
while chasing into the stretch, gave effort but had too much to overcome. FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY rated forwardly three wide, took closer order to have aim
three wide and under a ride past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on in mid stretch and faded. JASONTAKESLONG pressed the pace two wide and outside
of VISUAL ARTIST, failed to go on past the five sixteenths and weakened. SHOFAR , two wide and in range early, dropped back around the far turn and
failed to recover. BURGEE , between rivals early, dropped back after five eighths.

Footnotes
SPOTTED BULL stalked the duel in hand, moved up three deep leaving the turn, took command in upper stretch, was under urging in the drive and pulled
away. WILD BEHAVIOR disputed the pace outside JIMMY THE KID and weakened through the stretch. JIMMY THE KID , sent into contention soon after
the start, hugged the inner rail, battled for a half mile and was steadied in narrow quarters leaving the turn. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND , along the inner rail on
the turn, eased out three wide entering the stretch and failed to rally. BAD GUY raced in the two path on the turn and was not a factor. SHOULDA HAD IT ,
outrun, was four deep leaving the turn. An objection by the rider of JIMMY THE KID against WILD BEHAVIOR for alleged interference leaving the turn was
not allowed.

Footnotes
CIRCLING THE DRAIN rated off foes around the first turn, edged up four wide outside rivals heading into the far turn, bid three deep past the three eighths,
sparred outside TERMSOFENGAGEMENT entering the lane, shook clear under right handed asks in mid stretch then held sway while fully extended.
TERMSOFENGAGEMENT cleared early, set the pace towards the rail, dug in when confronted by rivals leaving the three eighths, emerged in a duel to the
inside of the winner approaching the stretch, could not quite go with that one nearing mid stretch but stayed on well. BYK , four wide around the first turn,
dropped in a path and prompted through the backstretch run, briefly threatened between rivals leaving the three furlong pole, chased the top pair into the
lane, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded. CORONOVA rated close up while saving ground, dropped off the leaders leaving the turn, steadied to avoid
LAMARVELOUS leaving the three eighths and weakened. LAMARVELOUS tracked the pace two wide, fell when appearing to clip heels nearing the three
furlong marker, bounded back up to gallop into the stretch, was corralled by the outrider and walked off. There was a stewards' inquiry involving
LAMARVELOUS around the final turn. No action was deemed necessary.

Footnotes
RASCALLY REBEL , alertly angled in leaving the backstretch, was always inside horses after that, found room through the stretch, led late and drove clear.
RUNNING RIVER broke slowly, lost ground around the turn, was six deep entering the stretch, drifted out and rallied. DISTANT FIRE , four deep around the
turn, chased the pace and finished willingly. SNIP THE ROSES , along the inner rail on the turn, remained inside foes in the stretch and rallied mildly.
MISTER RIPSTER , forced in by CAJUN FUN leaving the starting gate, was seven deep in upper stretch and failed to be a factor. CITI CREEK showed
speed, opened up leaving the turn, was well off the rail in the stretch and gave way. CAJUN FUN bore in leaving the starting gate, chased the pace while
three wide on th eturn and gave way the final furlong. BUBBA CHROME , a forward factor along the inner rail on the turn, gave way in the stretch. MOON
SIGN , checked in tight quarters shortly after the start, was not a factor. DUKE OF DOOLY raced in the three path on the turn and gave way.
ANNIESALLINCLUSIVE was outrun. SPUNKY IRISHMAN , reluctant to load into the starting gate, hugged the inner rail while chasing the early pace,
weakened mid way on the turn and was steadied in close quarters approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
LARAMORE , away alertly, rated forwardly while four wide early, moved up three wide and engaged the leader around the turn, dueled into the lane,
spurted clear past the three sixteenths, continued on under right handed asking and kept BAYLIS STREET at bay. BAYLIS STREET had speed inside foes
then was rated back off the leaders leaving the five eighths, sat close up under patient handling, eased out mid turn, ranged up four wide into the stretch,
pursued willingly on her left lead through the final furlong but was denied. DON'T TELL DEREN broke awkwardly, regrouped and raced off the pace while
saving ground, was pushed along past the five sixteenths, stayed inside through the drive and churned on to gain the show. COWGIRL SHINE , fractious in
the gate, broke slowly, edged up behind rivals past the five eighths, eased out around the turn, chased three wide into the stretch but flattened out late. O
SHAUGHESEY took over between rivals soon after the start, secured the inside and set a pressured pace, was joined by the winner around the turn, dueled
into the lane, fought on to about mid stretch then weakened. GALACTIC TIDE , sluggish while off the rail, swung five wide into the stretch but failed to
generate a run. VEGAS WILD CAT was sent up between rivals soon after the break and contested the pace, stayed on to mid turn then tired.
JIMMYDABOOK , wide, faltered.

Footnotes
BENEATH THE STARS pulled her way clear early and set a rated pace towards the rail, was guided off the inside while holding a daylight advantage into
the stretch, responded when set down right handed near mid stretch and held firm. MY FLICKER saved ground stalking the pace, edged up nearing mid
stretch, angled out leaving the sixteenth marker, kept on willingly and saved the place. COMBAT QUEEN , away alertly, drafted back off the pace in the
opening furlong then rated three wide, dropped in past the five sixteenths, came back out in the stretch and kept on with interest. BOURBON WILDCAT was
hustled up between rivals early, raced under asking three wide mid turn, angled out a bit wider for the drive but came up empty. ICY STARE DOWN was
angled out early, tracked the winner three wide, circled four wide under pressure into the stretch and gave way. SWEET GRACIE lost ground four to five
wide and failed to respond.
