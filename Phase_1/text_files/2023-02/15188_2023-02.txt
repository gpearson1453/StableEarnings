drifted a bit around the far turn and raced even late with no closing run on the top pair. NAUGHTY NOELLE dropped the back early on, saved ground and
had no response. The five eighths fractional time was unavailable.

LOOKIN FOR LARRY sprinted clear early on and held safe under steady handling. ASHWINS ORB stalked the pace, made a three to four wide bid and
finished willingly to the wire. WAR REPORTER raced mid pack early on, was along the inside into the upper stretch and was no match for the top pair to
race along for third. GENOMIC dropped back early, raced near the inside around the far turn and made a late gain. MORANT tracked the early leader while
racing two wide and weakened. KEARNEY dropped back early, raced four wide past the eighth pole and never was a factor. INSPEIGHTOFTHEDOG failed
to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
TOP OF THE GAME stalked the pace, moved up three wide to challenge the leader three wide near the three sixteenths pole and just got up under all out
pressure. DEBONNAIRE DUDE vied for the early lead from the inside and finished gamely to the wire. TOUGH COMPANY stalked the pace from the inside
and kept on to the wire while racing three wide. FORT KNOX raced off the early pace, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and made a late gain.
FAKE SOLUTION was off slowly, void of early speed and had no rally while racing two wide. TROY OUNCE pressed the pace from the outside of foe and
gave way. RUN FOR MATTY settled off the early pace along the inside and never threatened.
