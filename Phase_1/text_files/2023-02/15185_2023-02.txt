Footnotes
TONIGHT WE LOVE disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, shook clear in the two path midway through the turn, extended the advantage into upper
stretch, drew off under the crop into the final furlong and widened while kept to the task. FROSTY INVASION settled off the pace, was urged along passing
the nine-sixteenths, moved from the rail to the two path while hard ridden around the turn, came out into upper stretch and safely secured the place while no
match for the winner. TREAT STREET was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, settled off the pace, moved out near the five-eighths pole, was urged
four wide around the turn, came out into upper stretch, dropped back while remaining on her inside lead and weakened but was well clear for the show.
MENILY contested the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back outside the five-sixteenths, took a very awkward stride while out
of contention outside the furlong marker and faltered. VIRTUAL BEAUTY pressed the early pace between horses, dropped back with five furlongs to run, fell
further back leaving the backstretch, rounded the turn in the two path and also faltered. HAIL BRITANNIA was hard to load then fractious in the gate, broke
in and bumped the hindquarters of a foe then was taken up severely, spotted the front many lengths, angled in at the rear, tossed her head entering the
main-track, lagged at the back, went three wide around the turn and trailed.

Footnotes
PRISONER went to the front then showed the way with a clear advantage, extended the lead along the rail on the turn, remained well clear under a drive
into the final furlong and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. THINKABOUTIT settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the turn, turned
into upper stretch under a drive, gained on the winner in the final furlong and finished willingly to just get the place. JEMOGRAPHY settled at the rear of the
field, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, gained with good energy in the final furlong and finished well to just miss the place
while narrowly up for the show. NUCLEAR OPTION chased the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, kept on well in pursuit of the
winner in the final furlong and finished willingly to just miss the trifecta. ALCOOLS was hustled from the gate, chased the pace down the backstretch,
dropped back near the seven-sixteenths, fell further back while two then three wide on the turn and weakened. LAFITTE'S FLEET settled towards the rear,
moved from the two path to the four path around the turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
TREVOR BARDETTE bobbled at the start but broke in front, showed the way down the backstretch, extended the advantage while inside around the turn,
drew off under a drive into the final furlong and proved much the best. REUNION TOUR settled on the outside, was urged four wide around the turn and
safely secured the place while no match for the winner. THE GREAT GAZOO was coaxed along just off the pace on the outside, chased four then three
wide around the turn and weakened while clear for the show. NOAH'S DESTINY chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped from the three path to the
rail around the turn and tired. MR. BUSTA settled off the pace, steadied while in tight along the rail early on the turn then dropped back and capitulated.
IRON HORIZON chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back two then three wide on the turn and retreated. TYRANNOSAURUS REX broke in
and hit the gate, moved out while urged along at the rear, went three then four wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
GREATEST LOVE was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the inside of the runner-up, vied inside to the two path on the turn, responded well
when set down into upper stretch, shook off the runner-up inside the furlong marker and drew away under strong urging. ICY REPLY broke in and bumped
soundly with a rival, disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path around the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, battled outside the
winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place. TILSA bumped solidly with a rival outside the three-quarter pole
and steadied, was well placed behind the leading duo, dropped back under urging while inside to the two path around the turn, spun three wide into the
stretch and weakened but was well clear for the show. PRAIRIE FIRE was coaxed along on the outside, went four wide under urging around the turn and
came up empty. VIRADIA was last to commence, climbed some at the rear early, settled on the outside, went five wide under urging on the turn and was no
factor. EXFILTRATION was bumped soundly at the start, bumped solidly with another foe early, dropped to the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed to
respond.

JOEYBIGNOSE broke in then dropped well off the pace, saved ground around the turn, swung six wide while rallying into upper stretch, closed fast to get
the lead just inside the furlong marker then powered away while much the best. UKRAINIAN PRINCESS brushed with a foe leaving the chute, raced up
close to the pace, chased four wide around the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, remained on her inside until just outside the furlong marker then
swapped to the proper lead and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. LADY BANKER went to the front, raced under extra left-rein
pressure leaving the chute, showed the way down the backstretch under pressure from her outside, vied inside of a foe while along the rail on the turn,
turned into upper stretch under a drive, battled into the final furlong and weakened while best of the rest. BERNING HONOR pressed the pace on the
outside, vied in the two to three path around the turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and tired. APEROL SPRITZ broke out then was quickly
corrected by the rider, tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back under urging near the five-eighths, moved from the five path to the three path on the
turn and captitulated. FORALLTHEGIRLS was last to begin, raced at the rear, went two to three wide on the turn and was no factor. REIGN OF THUNDER
was hustled from the gate, brushed with an opponent leaving the chute, chased under strong urging, dropped back near the five-eighths, fell to the rear in
the four to five path around the turn and faltered then was distanced.

turn, rallied five wide into upper stretch, closed well to get the lead into the final sixteenth, led until the final stride but was denied while able to get the place.
MARVIN tracked the pace down the backstretch, issued an outside challenge in the three path around the turn, gained the advantage outside the
quarter-pole, led under a drive while still on his inside lead into the final furlong, was headed by the runner-up at the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished
while able to get the show. CHARLIE FIVE O moved in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked under threat while inside
on the turn, lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole, came off the rail into upper stretch, fought on under a drive into the final sixteenth then weakened.

turn and gained ground but was no factor. CASALSA chased the pace down the backstretch, went four wide around the turn, pursued the leaders in the
drive and lacked the needed kick. STANDUP was bumped on both sides at the start then moved out while sent hard, went three to four wide on the turn,

Footnotes
GOOD SKATE showed good speed from the outside, angled in while going to the front, raced inside around the first turn, showed the way down the
backstretch, controlled the action while inside on the far turn, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch
and proved much the best under strong urging. CURBSTONE was fractious in the gate, traveled around the first turn in the two path under restraint, moved
up between foes outside the five-eighths, was urged four wide around the far turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and finished willingly for the place.
TIMBUKTU broke out then was corrected while hustled, showed speed inside of the winner then conceded the front and was taken back and switched out,
raced in the three path around the opening bend, stalked the pace on the outside, chased two to three wide around the far turn and weakened but earned
the show. MAILMAN'S A FLYER broke out then was quickly corrected by the rider, settled on the inside, was urged along midway down the backstretch,
saved ground on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to respond. BOLD VICTORY went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was
urged along midway down the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the four path and also failed to respond. UNION LIGHTS went three wide around the first
turn, settled off the pace, was urged along passing the five-eighths, dropped back while inside to the two path on the far turn and faltered.

stretch, responded well under the crop in the final furlong and held under strong urging. WANNA WINNA bumped with a rival at the start, moved in while
well back early on the backstretch, went three to four wide on the turn and finished with good energy to just get the place. LUCKY LUCKY LUKE bumped

willingly to just miss the place while clear for the show. MORETHANAFEELING stumbled at the start then bumped with a foe, raced just off the pace,
steadied along the rail early on the turn, moved to the two path later on that bend and lacked the needed response. ENGINEER EMPIRE was forwardly

four wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and was no factor. GEM MINT TEN was well placed just off the pace, moved from the two path to the four
path under urging on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and came up empty. SCARAMANGA bumped with an opponent at the start, pressed the pace
on the outside then in three path around the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated. VOLCKER RULES angled in while well off the pace early

to run, saved ground on the turn and retreated. IN MY SHADOW lacked early speed, saved ground on the turn, came out into upper stretch and showed
