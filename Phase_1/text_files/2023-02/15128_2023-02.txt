Footnotes
GENERAL MATHIS got knocked into outer rival leaving the gate, settled in the two path, moved closer three deep up the backstretch, challenged three
deep at the quarter pole, took over into the stretch, drifted in a bit in upper stretch, shook free with a furlong to go and won going away. EXPLAIN THIS
AUDIT brushed leaving the gate, sat off the pace along the rail early, on the move in the middle stages then had to put the brakes on behind the leader into
the far turn, lost some ground around the bend but remained inside, looked to rally but got put in a tight spot in upper stretch, gained a clear path and
finished determinedly for the place honors. ONCOMING brushed leaving the gate, was rank tossing his head about early, chased two wide then went up to
force the pace on the first turn then ceded command, stalked the lone leader to the far turn, bid between around the bend, fought for command to the eighth
pole, flattened late and saved the show. RIMPROTECTOR pulled racing first time through the stretch, trailed on the inside then moved out and went three
wide around the second bend, showed a mild rally when called upon but missed the show. BENDER got bumped leaving the gate, chased four then three
wide around the first turn, traveled between foes then two wide on the second bend, altered out steadily when chasing behind ONCOMING and could not
rally. OUR SHINING LIGHT (IRE) broke out and bumped GENERAL MATHIS, went up to take control while in hand early, took pressure from outside on the
clubhouse turn before moving clear again, challenged by a pair of outer rivals on the final turn, lost the lead into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
SONORAN dueled with DON CORLEONE early then inched ahead to take control, led two wide into the turn then moved over to the rail around the bend,
showed the way two wide into the drive, shook free in upper stretch and drew off under urging. CASTLE ISLAND was fractious in the gate, chased wide up
the backstretch, angled into the three path on the turn, exited the bend four wide and bested the rest. DAZZLEMESILVER hit the gate and broke inward,
chased on the inside out of range into the turn, tipped two wide around the bend, angled out in upper stretch and was along for the show. DON CORLEONE
broke well, dueled briefly then pressed the pace from outside, remained alongside the leader through the turn, lost touch in upper stretch and weakened in
the furlong grounds. BRING HIM HOME broke in and bumped rival, became rank early and lagged behind up the backstretch, remained far back into the
lane and passed a tired rival at the wire. XANDER took a bumped leaving the gate, stalked the top pair up the backstretch, angled in on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
FLINT STROLL raced near the back outside a rival, moved closer three deep in the middle stages, bid four then three deep on the far turn, battled four deep
while taking a short lead into the final furlong, dueled with ARREST in the final sixteenth and gamely prevailed. ARREST pulled into the first turn chasing
from the rail, raced in range in range up the backstretch, tipped two wide on the far turn, angled in at the top of the lane to launch a rail bid, fought inside
rivals then dueled with FLINT STROLL late and missed. NAISMITH stalked from inside then moved out on the backstretch and applied pressure to the
leader, took over at the five-sixteenths pole, lost command with a furlong remaining, fought on to the sixteenth marker and saved the show. WHAT A DUDE
forwardly placed in the two path early, traveled up close three deep into the far turn, bid three then two wide between rivals around the bend and into the
stretch, stayed on to deep stretch and faltered late. KO SAMUI (IRE) reserved in the two path early then went between rivals, had to pause when running up
on rivals heels into the far turn, traveled three deep at the quarter pole, tipped out in upper stretch and lacked a late bid. ALGERIA (IRE) trailed early in the
two path, spun three wide into the drive and failed to rally. SILENT DISCO was off slow to start, unhurried and moved inside, tipped two wide and went
between foes leaving the far turn and lacked further response. GRAZEN SUN tracked outside a pair of rivals early, dropped further back in the middle
stages, trailed four wide into the lane and had little left. ROSENQUIST cleared early and crossed over to the inside, received pressure from outside on the
backstretch, lost the lead at the five-sixteenths marker, may have been put in tight and had to steady late on the far turn and retreated.

Footnotes
THE CHOSEN VRON took control early and moved into the two path then set the pace under pressure, maintained command over LEYAS CANDY around
the far turn, shook free in upper stretch and widened when flagged with the whip and steady handling late. LEYAS CANDY paused briefly when THE
CHOSEN VRON crossed in front early then went up to prompt the pace from outside in the three path, kept the pressure on through the far turn, was no
match for the winner in upper stretch and stayed on to prove second best. COALINGA ROAD stalked the pacesetter from inside, lost ground while being
asked on the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch and weakened. CLUB CAL tracked two wide early, dropped back two then three wide around far turn
and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
DANCING RINCA pressed the pace from outside, took over leaving the bend in the two path, cleared outside the eighth pole and drew off. QUALITY WINS
pulled the rider along while rank early, traveled in range from the two path, moved out in the drive and finished willingly for a clear second. CLASSICALLY
turned his head and broke inward leaving the gate, settled inside off the pace, saved ground to the stretch, then summoned a mild rally along the fence to
earn the show. NASHOBA'S JOY dropped back early, made mild progress while angling four wide on the turn and kept on to earn a minor award. PRINCIP
stalked outside rivals to the turn, bid three deep at the quarter pole, failed to sustain the challenge in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds.
VANCOUGAR bobbled leaving the gate but recovered quickly to take the front, set the pace under pressure from outer rival to the turn, resisted through the
bend before being overtaken into the lane and weakened. ADMIRALTY PLACE (GB) reserved in the early stages, rounded the bend three wide and failed to
menace. ADMIRAL HALSEY stalked the pace from inside, waited for room behind the leader on the turn, tipped out in upper stretch but lacked room in the
drive. BLUE DOG traveled off the pace outside rivals, dropped back four then three wide on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
JACK SIXPACK raced up close from outside early, bid alongside the leader with three furlongs remaining, dueled into the lane, took over in upper stretch,
cleared past the eighth pole and drew away. SUNRISE JOURNEY took control early from inside, showed the way to the turn, challenged by JACK SIXPACK
around the bend, dueled into the stretch, lost command in upper stretch, failed to kick on with the winner in midstretch but was clearly second best. SUZIE
QZZ BROTHER stalked the pace from inside, lost ground around the turn, flattened in the furlong grounds but churned on to hold third. I KNOW CASH
FLOW chased off the rail, asked three wide on the turn and could not offer a response. SMILE FOR GLORY stumbled a bit leaving the gate, drifted while a
bit rank early behind rivals, shifted three wide into the turn and failed to menace. ECONOMICAL raced off the pace up the backstretch, rounded the bend
four wide and weakened. BIG TALKER chased off the rail to the turn, dropped back around the bend, eased into the stretch, fell at the three-sixteenths pole
and was vanned off.

Footnotes
REAL FIRE was forced to take up twice early, pulled leaving the backstretch, still under a hold on the turn, moved out in the lane, rallied under right-handed
urging and drove clear. AVA'S STORM sped to the front and crossed over, showed the way along the inside through the turn, challenged with a furlong left
to run, led into the final sixteenth, then was overtaken by REAL FIRE and held the place. STRIKINGLY was off a bit slow in the beginning, got blocked
behind trouble rival and boxed in on the turn, tipped out in the lane, finished well and missed second. CUBAN CRISIS (GB) had to steady early, went
between rivals chasing on the turn, took aim three wide into the stretch, drew alongside the leader but lacked the needed late kick in deep stretch.
PRECOCIOUS TIMES was off slow in the beginning, angled inward chasing off the pace, tipped out into the lane, angled out further in the drive and put in a
late run. CLASSY raced outside a pair of rivals and got brushed by inner rival up the backstretch, spun five wide into the lane and could not rally. MAP TO
MY HEART showed early speed then steadied and came in to bump inner rival early, was closest in pursuit from outside into the turn, exited the bend two
wide and weakened. ROSY EDGE settled inside, saved ground through the turn, lacked room in upper stretch and was ridden out late. ONE ARROW
stalked three deep early, entered the lane four wide, got crowded between rivals in upper stretch and could not recover. SQUARE FUN bobbled to the front
leaving the gate, got forced in and bumped by outer rival early, chased along the rail around the bend and weakened. AMAGE broke a step slow, raced off
the pace, altered out at the three-eighths pole, spun four wide into the drive, tipped out further in the stretch and failed to make an impact. THERE WAS A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE EARLY RUNNING ON THE BACKSTRETCH, FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT MAP
TO MY HEART WAS TO BLAME FOR CAUSING TROUBLE BUT SINCE THE RUNNERS AFFECTED FINISHED IN FRONT OF MAP TO MY HEART, NO
CHANGE WOULD BE MADE.

Footnotes
PRINCESS ADALEIGH brushed the gate then went up to take control, set the pace on the inside to the stretch and held well over the runner-up through the
final furlong. KRISTI'S TIGER brushed the gate and moved out some but was still away quickly from outside, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch,
applied some pressure into the turn then chased two wide around the bend, continued to give chase behind the leader through the stretch and finished
willingly for a clear second. YOUTEYOURHONOR brushed leaving the gate, stalked the speed from inside and flattened in the lane. BOWL OF CHERRIES
coaxed along up the backstretch chasing outside a rival, went two wide around the bend, tipped out in the lane and weakened. TROUVILLE broke a step
slow, tracked outside rivals to the turn, navigated the turn three wide and weakened. ACT OF SERENDIPITY brushed in the beginning, trailed on the inside
then two wide around the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
LA V. got bumped leaving the gate, dueled for the lead from outside, inched ahead midway around the turn, put away inner rival leaving the bend and drew
away under urging. MAJESTIC GIGI dueled for the lead from inside, lost touch with the winner into the stretch, churned on through the lane and saved the
place. BONITA LEONA stumbled and bumped with rivals on both sides leaving the gate, chased between then got shuffled back early on the turn, came
three wide into the stretch, moved out further and put in a late run but missed the place. NEVER SWAY chased four deep to the turn, raced outside a rival
around the bend, three wide into the drive and lacked a bid. SOUL SWEET broke well then dropped back off the pace, saved ground through the turn and
kept on to improve position. HEAD START broke out and was quickly corrected, chased off the rail, inside then two wide two wide on the turn and
weakened. ROSES R BLUE was off slow in the beginning, traveled near the back off the rail, went three wide into the lane and failed to menace. DRIZELLA
took a light bumped shortly after the start, chased three deep between rivals, got shuffled back at the seven-sixteenths pole, spun four wide into the lane
and weakened. KEEPURSELF ALIVE was fractious and unseated the rider in the gate, broke out and bumped rival to come away last, trailed two wide into
the lane and was never a factor.
