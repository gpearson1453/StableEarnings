Footnotes
MORO OUTLAW broke in at the start then dueled in the second flight to the turn then made a rail bid, moved out to two wide in upper stretch and took over
in mid stretch and pulled away. I SEE CLEARLY NOW was void of early speed, made a three wide bid at the quarter pole then moved out farther to the four
or five path in upper stretch for a late rally. BONANZA GRADE tracked the leaders from the two path to upper stretch and weakened. EASY CHANCE was
bumped by BELLO CREEDO at the start then rushed up to a clear lead to mid stretch and tired. SWIFT N TRAFFIC stalked the pace from the three path to
the quarter pole and gave way. BELLO CREEDO broke out and bumped EASY CHANCE at the start then raced back and was not a factor. MORO MAFIA
dueled in the second flight to the five sixteenths pole then steadied and lost action.

Footnotes
MR B QUIET stalked the pace to the quarter pole then made a five wide bid to engage the leader at the top of the stretch then dueled with M AND M'S
CUSTOM to the wire and won the nod. M AND M'S CUSTOM was within striking distance around the first turn then made a four wide bid at the quarter pole
and took the lead at the eighth pole, dueled in the stretch and lost the nod. DONNA'S COURT set the pace from the two path while battling for the lead
down the backstretch then inched away at the quarter pole, was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way grudgingly. APPLEWOOD was allowed to
settle down the backstretch, made a bid at the quarter pole then moved out to three or four wide in upper stretch for a late run but was too late. TAPPED
OUT raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground to the top of the stretch then moved out to four or five wide and improved position. CUSTOMIZE
MY QUEST pressed the pace from the inside while battling for the lead to the quarter pole and tired. GRAND PRIORITY tracked the leaders around the
then moved up down the backstretch but lacked the late response. DUTCHMAN was unhurried to the first turn and was distanced, walked off.

CAJUN CATALINA went to a pressured lead from the inside then pulled away at the five sixteenths pole and drew off in the stretch. CAJUN TRINITY
pressed the pace from the three path to the quarter pole and proved to be a clear second. TDZ CORRIENDA STAR dueled off the pace from the inside to
the three eighths pole and proved to be best of the rest. SPLITTING ACES raced in the middle of the pack from four to five wide throughout and improve
position in the stretch. RUN AWAY SAMARI pressed the pace from the two path to the quarter pole and tired. CRIMSON GLORY hesitated at the start then
rushed up the rail on the backstretch, moved out to two wide at the quarter pole then went three or four wide in upper stretch but faltered. LUCKY BEAD
LADY was always back. LONG SHOT LOUISE dueled from off the pace to the three eighths pole and dropped back.

HEZA PICKLE was allowed to settle around the first turn then made a four wide bid at the three eighths pole, engaged the leader late in the stretch and was
up in the final strides. GOTMY MO JO WORKIN pressed the pace around the first turn then took the lead leaving the turn, was under pressure to the top of
the stretch when he pulled clear but drifted out at the sixteenth pole and was nailed at the wire. SALUTE NOW saved ground while racing in the middle of
the pack through the final turn then made a two wide rally to be up for the show. WOOD RIVER raced near the back around the first turn then made a bid
from three wide at the five sixteenths pole, was in striking distance at the top of the stretch but checked when leader drifted out and finished evenly. KINGS
WAGER brief early foot away from the gate, pressed the pace to the top of the stretch and tired. MEET KEVIN chased the leaders to the three eighths pole
and dropped back. JOCKEY OBJECTION, THE JOCKEY OF WOOD RIVER CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF GOTMY MO JO WORKIN FOR

MY SWEET SOPHIA went to a clear lead to set all the pace and drew away in the drive. BEAUTIFUL ENDING stalked the pace from the inside through the
final turn then angled out to the two path but was no match for the winner. GLORY TO ME tracked the leaders from three wide through the final turn then
moved out to four wide in upper stretch and made a late push to be a clear third. HIDDEN EXPECTATION was off the pace to the top of the stretch and
tired. LACIS JEWEL hopped at the start and remained back. HOLY WAR was allowed to settle around the first turn but was never a threat.

Footnotes
MEAN AMERICAN pressed the pace from the three path down the backstretch then took the lead at the top of the stretch and drew off. GIRLS COUNT
broke out at the start, was within striking distance from the inside to the top of the stretch then moved out two to three wide in upper stretch and made a late
surge to be up up for the place. HERE COMES LOVIE veered in and bumped LITTLE E after the start, was placed off the pace down the backstretch then
made a four wide bid at the quarter pole for a late run to just get up for show. ANGELA'S CELERITY sprinted to a pressured lead from the inside to the
three sixteenths pole and weakened. LITTLE E bumped with HERE COMES LOVIE at the start, settled in the middle of the pack to the final turn then made
a rail bid into the stretch and flattened out. CHARGED TEMP pressed the pace from the two path to the quarter pole and gave way. BATTY was allowed to
settle around the first turn but was no a threat. ZEATRICAL saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
QUANA DUDE raced in the middle of the pace from the three path then made a bid from four wide at the quarter pole, closed willingly and drew clear.
SWEET RACHEL settled in the middle of the pace from the two path to the final turn then was coaxed at the quarter pole but was no match for the winner.
HOT ARTIE tracked the leader around the first turn move to engage at the quarter pole and took the lead at the eighth pole then was collared in the final
sixteenth and tired. OPTIMISTIC shot away from the gate to take a clear lead around the first turn then was headed at the quarter pole, fought gamely to the
final sixteenth and tired. CUSTOM KAT raced in the middle of the pace from the inside down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the final turn and
faltered. SHANGHAI RONNIE was pinched back early then moved up on the backstretch to improve position. HIGH RIDGE settled in the middle of the pack
and raced evenly. MY BOBBY MCGEE was not a threat. CROCODILE JACQUES was five wide into the first turn and was always back. KING MARVIN had
a shoe repair in the paddock, slipped at the start then was hustled along to track the leaders to the quarter pole and was done.
