Footnotes
ST HELENA forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the moderate pace then advanced to press the pace to the second turn, came to even terms with
MANY MARKETS nearing the furlong pole, drifted in and bumped that rival in deep stretch, dueled with the runner-up to the wire and determinedly
prevailed. MANY MARKETS assumed command leaving the break, cleared the field into the first turn and set moderate fractions through the backstretch
run, was well handled into the far turn, held ST HELENA at bay to mid-stretch, was bumped in deep stretch when ST HELENA drifted in, was stubborn in a
duel to the wire and was gamely bested in the final stages, while besting the rest. UNWHIRLED prominent into the first turn, stalked the pace while well
positioned through the backstretch run, raced three wide to the quarter marker, lacked a final response in the drive and held for third in the late stages.
FLIPLIT chased the moderate early fractions, raced four wide on the far turn and did not offer a late rally. RELUCTANT crowded at the start and was away a
step slowly, was a bit keen in the early going, settled along the backstretch run, steadied in tight quarters entering the second turn, raced two wide to the
quarter marker, showed late interest in the drive but was unable to impact the leaders in the final stages. CONNIE'S PROMISE was allowed to settle, never
far back through the backstretch run, lost contact leaving the quarter marker and tired in the stretch run. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE
RUNNING IN THE STRETCH DRIVE. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ST HELENA DRIFTED IN IN MID-STRETCH AND
BUMPED MANY MARKETS BUT THIS INCIDENT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO COST MANY MARKETS THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING AND
THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
LOVE'EM N LEAVE'EM broke out at the start, showed early speed and pressed the solid pace to the turn, kept close attendance to the pacesetter to the
quarter marker, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, drew to even terms with BETTOR TRIP NICK nearing the furlong pole, dueled to deep stretch while outside
of that rival, drifted in under right-handed urging just before the wire and prevailed over the game runner-up. BETTOR TRIP NICK asked to show early
speed, engaged with LOVE'EM N LEAVE'EM and set a pressured pace through solid early fractions, was headed in mid-stretch by LOVE'EM N LEAVE'EM,
dueled under firm urging in deep stretch, was bumped in the final strides when the winner drifted in and was gamely bested on the wire, while clear of the
rest for place. PAPAPIFAS took back off of the dueling early pacesetters, saved ground to top of the lane, closed in the final furlong while under steady
urging and outfinished LI MU BAI for show in deep stretch. LI MU BAI (IRE) stumbled at the start and was away a step slowly, chased from the second flight
in the early going, raced three wide into the stretch run, closed in the final furlong and was outfinished for third. AWESOME DUDE chased from the second
flight in the early stages, came in a bit tight entering the turn, lost ground nearing the top of the lane and was not able to factor in the drive. THERE WAS A
JOCKEY'S OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF BETTOR TRIP NICK AGAINST THE RIDER OF LOVE'EM N LEAVE'EM FOR THE INCIDENT IN
DEEP STRETCH AND IN A UNANIMOUS RULING THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH
BASED ON THAT INCIDENT.

Footnotes
MISS BELLIMBUSTO prominent in the early going, stalked the decent early fractions, confronted NIGHT PARTY nearing the quarter marker, overtook that
foe in upper stretch and drew to a clear lead nearing the furlong pole, kept to task in deep stretch and was ridden out in the final stages as much the best. A
ROUSING BABE stalked the decent early pace, advanced on the turn, came in tight and was boxed in nearing the top of the lane, shifted out and found
room in the drive, was no match for the winner in the final furlong but stayed on to be second best. YODERANDO was away slowly and was allowed to
settle in the early going, saved ground to the top of the stretch, was not able to impact the top pair in the final furlong and passed tiring rivals in the late
stages to secure third. NIGHT PARTY was away in good order and was sent to establish the early lead, set decent fractions to the turn, came under
pressure nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken by MISS BELLIMBUSTO in upper stretch and faded in the final stages. PATSY MONTANA chased the
decent early fractions, raced three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch run and did not threaten. MATCHLESS broke out at the start and was
off a step slowly, chased the decent early pace, gained ground while three wide nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain that run in the stretch and
gave way.

EL CHARRO CHAMP away in good order, took back off of the solid early pace, was well positioned into the turn, roused three wide into the stretch run,
closed fast inside of the furlong pole, came within aim of HARBOR KITTY in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail. HARBOR KITTY was
away a step slowly and was hustled to establish the early lead, set the pressured pace to the turn, dueled with OBVIOUS to the quarter marker, shook free
from that foe in upper stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong grounds, felt pressure inside of the sixteenth-marker from the winner and was tagged
for the win in the final strides, while besting the rest. OBVIOUS prominent in the early stages, pressed the solid fractions to the quarter marker while outside
of HARBOR KITTY, lost ground to that rival in upper stretch, chased in the final furlong and lacked a late response, while clear of the rest for third. MILEYS
BLUECAT was off a step slowly and was asked to show early speed, raced close to the pace into the turn, lost position while saving ground into the drive
and did not offer a late rally. INDIANERA took back in the early going, lacked speed into the turn, raced four wide nearing the quarter pole, encountered
traffic heading into the stretch run, swung five wide for the drive and did not threaten in the late stages. TRABIESO AVELITO chased the decent early pace,
gained ground while two wide on the turn, raced three wide into the drive, could not sustain his bid in the final furlong and gave way. RHODIUM RUNNER
chased the solid early pace, raced three then four wide on the turn, slipped to the two path in upper stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
ARGENTINA CRIES (IRE) away in good order, took back off of the solid pace heading into the turn, tipped three wide nearing the top of the stretch,
responded to firm urging in upper stretch, confronted MR. FIGHTER nearing the furlong marker, overtook that rival while on the left lead and kept to task in
the final stages to prove best. MR. FIGHTER stumbled leaving the start, recovered to be prominent in the early stages, assumed command nearing the turn,
showed good speed through the turn and opened to a clear lead nearing the top of the lane, came under pressure from the winner in mid-stretch, could not
keep pace with ARGENTINA CRIES in the final stages and just held for place in the final strides. APLOMBADO shuffled at the start and was off slowly,
lacked early speed, saved ground to the top of the lane, found his best stride late and just missed for place, while holding safely in the end for show.
CONDORCAT away in good order, raced close to the solid early pace, lost ground to MR. FIGHTER on the turn, re-rallied in the drive and came within aim
in mid-stretch, could not sustain that second effort in the final stages and weakened. ZHIVAGO broke in a tangle and bothered neighboring foes at the start,
chased the solid fractions to the turn, raced three wide between rivals to the quarter marker and tired in the drive. STORMY JOE bothered at the start by
ZHIVAGO and was off a step slowly, chased the solid early pace, encountered traffic while outside of rivals on the turn and gave way in the stretch.

AMERICA GREAT broke in at the start and bothered SECRET CLUB, was hustled to the early lead then well rated through modest fractions to the half-mile
marker, quickened along the far turn when confronted by WARD 'N JERRY, turned away that foe and extended the lead in upper stretch, kept to task in the
final stages and held sway in a drive at the end to prevail. BIG FLAME settled in the second flight in the early stages, saved all of the ground to the far turn,
advanced in upper stretch, made a steady gain in the final furlong, could not reel in the winner in the final stages and was up in the final strides to secure
second. OTTAWA FIRE (IRE) forwardly placed in the early going, tracked the modest fractions from a three wide position into the far turn, advanced nearing
the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, offered a mild late bid but was outfinished in the final sixteenth and was just edged for second, while just
holding for third. SECRET CLUB bothered at the start by AMERICA GREAT and was off a step slowly, settled in the second flight in the early stages, raced
three wide to the quarter marker, raced four wide into the stretch run, ran evenly to the furlong pole, rallied in the final stages and just missed for the minor
awards. WARD 'N JERRY prominent in the early running, attended to the modest fractions to the half-mile marker, confronted AMERICA GREAT nearing
the quarter pole, was turned away in that bid and chased AMERICA GREAT to mid-stretch, could not hold off oncoming rivals in the final stages and was
just edged for the minor awards. C'MON MAN unhurried in the early going, saved ground to the far turn, angled three wide for the drive, could not impact the
leaders in the late stages but found his best stride late. GALLANT WARREN forwardly placed in the early going, was well placed through the backstretch
run, saved ground into the far turn, chased the leaders to the furlong pole and did not offer a late response. LOAFERS BOY was allowed to settle, raced
three wide into the backstretch run, swung four wide into the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
IRISH SONG LEADER lagged well behind early, circled the field on the far turn, came into the stretch five wide and continued the rally down the stretch to
win going away. HALLELUJAH BABY broke well and gained the early advantage without much pressure, opened a clear lead through the first turn, held the
lead to the far turn, fended off a host of challengers in the stretch and outfinished all but one. SPORTS FOR WOMEN allowed the pace to develop while
saving ground into the clubhouse turn, tipped out to the three path for the backstretch run and pulled the rider to a position just off the pacesetter, mounted a
challenge under pressure from the five sixteenths, vied for the lead in mid-stretch, could not keep pace in the late stages and was well clear in the end for
show. LEXCELLENT content to settle mid-pack and save ground into the first turn, improved position after a quarter mile, inched up to put some pressure
on the leader through the turn, had every chance in the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. CUTE RENEGADE well off the early pace, stayed to the
inside and made some forward progress through the far turn, needed some racing room turning into the stretch, raced on the wrong lead and was done with
a furlong to go. I'M GONNA SHINE hustled to join the leaders early, raced wide throughout, was pushed to go after the leaders from the three eighths pole,
swung four wide into the stretch, tired, and was unable summon a rally. DADDY'S MOM brushed with TIZ SO SPECIAL at the break, took up slightly
spotting the field a little bit of a head start, chased the field for the first half mile, attempted a bid on the turn but was unable to make up any ground or
improve position in the stretch. TIZ SO SPECIAL broke in at the start and brushed with DADDY'S MOM, rated close up early behind the leader to the far
turn, was let loose near the seven sixteenths pole but did not offer up much of a response.
