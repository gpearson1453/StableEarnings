advanced very wide and finished well while no threat. RAINBOW TROUT saved ground off the pace, continued willingly while no factor. XENATOWN broke
a step slowly, chased outside and lacked a rally. TOURING MARYANNE trailed for half a mile inside and passed fading rivals. MAZAL EIGHTEEN sprinted
to a clear lead down the backstretch then stopped on the turn. PURRFECT MISTRESS prompted the pace for a quarter mile then gave way readily.

Footnotes
OLD HEAD settled off the pace, angled four wide rallying on the turn then edged clear late. BRUNO BARBER GIRL lagged far behind, advanced wide in the
stretch narrowing the gap too late. BIG AMBITION prompted the pace in the two path and continued willingly. WILDCAT GIRL raced just behind the
pacesetters and flattened out in the stretch. TRUE PHENOMENON forced the pace three wide, led into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. WILL
BE NOW chased off the pacesetters three wide and lacked a rally. CAPE NEDDICK dropped far behind then passed fading rivals. THENDARA'S LOST
earned a narrow advantage inside for half a mile and gave way. TELL ME IM AWESOME broke sluggishly and was always outrun. SENSIBLE MARRIAGE
raced within range four wide down the backstretch and stopped. SIRENETTA trailed throughout losing contact with her field.

Footnotes
POP THE CLUTCH settled off the pace on the inside, moved up on the backside, bid three wide on the far turn, took over, drew clear and held well under
urging in the stretch run. MILWAUKEE BAY steadied at the start, trailed the field, advanced three wide, moved up four wide on the far turn, angled in, rallied
on the rail and dug in gamely inside to the finish. ANOTHER SAUCY SIX raced off the pace inside, advanced two wide on the far turn, went three wide past
the quarter pole, rallied mildly and bested the others. MISBEHAVING LADY tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and
lacked a rally. IMAGISM set the pace racing with a clear lead, dueled between rivals on the far turn and faded. BOHEMIA BABE raced four wide early,
stalked the pace, made a rail bid on the far turn, dueled briefly and faded.

FRAME THIS trailed far behind, advanced inside, angled out late then surged off in the final sixteenth. SWEET LILLY FACTUM settled off the pace, rallied
on the turn, led in midstretch but was caught. SEA PINES chased off the pace outside, angled to the rail on the turn then weakened. CICI UNIFIED lacked
speed along the rail early, moved wide on the turn then flattened out. LULINDA'S HEART lacked speed, faded on the turn and was never a factor. JET
FORCE sprinted away in the opening quarter mile, was collared on the turn and stopped. FROSTED WILD RIDE raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter
and gave way.

Footnotes
JOHN DUTTON settled behind the dueling leaders, angled out on the turn, then wore down that rival in the late stages. BUMP N RUN hustled to a narrow
lead inside, vied through the turn and held on gamely. MCCRAKENS GHOST prompted the pace outside, raced close up to the stretch and weakened.
PRAETORIAN GUARD was taken up sharply in the opening furlong, bid very wide on the turn and tired. RYAN'S FLEET was in tight in the opening the
furlong; chased inside and faded. HOT LOVE moved closer three wide on the turn then stopped. An objection by the fourth finisher against the third finisher
for early interference was dismissed.
