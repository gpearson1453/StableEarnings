collared in the final yards. G G RULES bumped by inside rival at the start, stalked pace along the rail, continued along the rail on the turn, lacked a bit a
room in upper stretch, chose to dive down to rail and made a rally while in tight to just miss. CINDY chased dueling rivals off the rail on the backstretch,
continued off the rail on the turn, loomed boldly entering the lane and flattened out the final sixteenth. JEANIE'S SWAN off half length slow and bumped
back at the start, settled well of the pace and well off the rail on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, continued two wide into the lane and passed tiring
rival in a non threatening effort. HUDSON FLYER broke out and bumped rival at the start, settled off pace and on the rail, continued to save ground on the
turn and lacked bid. HAMPTONRUN sent for lead along the inside on the backstretch, failed to get lead entering the turn, continued along the inside, failed

Footnotes
APOLLITICAL PENCE broke in a path at the start, quickly cleared while drifting out a path, kept under a strong hand ride throughout and just held off rival at
the wire. EMPRESSUM off a bit slow, rider tugged on left rein to move away from outside rival, drifted out after being asked, then put in a strong rally once
in the clear, took lead right before wire but lost on the re-bob and galloped out strongly . SCOOPS DYNASTY away well, lightly brushed on hind end early,
kept under steady right handed urging throughout in a solid effort . STUCK IN PROBATE away cleanly, asked right handed early, asked again passing the
gap causing him to shift and drift in, asked again midway and leveled off and finished with interest. DASHA DYNASTY lightly brushed at the start, asked left
handed early, drifted out under left handed urging past the gap and lost momentum . DASHA GOOD REASON away cleanly, brushed by rivals on both
sides early, asked left handed and drifted out pass the gap, kept under hand ride rest of the way in a even effort. JESS BEING A FRIEND false broke and
broke thru the gate, reloaded and away well, ran a bit sideways early, asked and straightened out, midpack throughout and had a couple choppy strides late
LONDON TOBY away slow with head high, floated in due to rival taking path and brushed inside rival, lugged out early and asked right handed to straighten
out, bit uncomfortable approaching the final sixteenth and finished with mild interest MISTER TORNADO away well while breaking in a path, immediately
asked right handed, leaned in while passing the gap, and kept to task while being outrun. AMADEUS MV off slow, asked left handed early, asked again and
lacked path, rider attempted to alter path, but caused AMADEUS MV to lug out five paths.
