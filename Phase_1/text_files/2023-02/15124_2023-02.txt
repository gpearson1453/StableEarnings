Footnotes
LITTLE BLAKER showed good early foot to set the early pace along the inside, was pressured a bit from the outside near the half mile pole, opened a clear
lead into the far turn and remained clear under a steady hand ride. BEAT THE DEALER settled off the early going, made an advance through the far turn,
took aim at the leader near the three sixteenths pole but couldn't match to finished second best while racing three to four wide. DEER CREEK ROAD was
unhurried early on, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and moved up late to improve position. HANSENATION tracked the early
leader down the backstretch, put pressure on Little Blaker past the half mile pole. DR. ZARNETT stalked the pace along the inside, raced five deep into the
upper stretch and faded. SAMMY DA BULL dropped back early, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no response.

Footnotes
CAPTIVATING ART showed good early foot to set the early pace along the inside, raced near the four path in the lane and held gamely to be clear under
strong handling. LELAWALA settled off the early going, moved up near the rail around the far turn through the stretch and finished well to get up for the
place position late. UNCAPTURED FAITH stalked the pace, raced five to six wide into the upper stretch and kept on to the wire. FIONA raced mid pack
early on, made a five wide bid passing the five sixteenths pole and flattened out. LUCKYWISE stalked the early going, raced near the inside through the
upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. MAIDEN ROCK was unhurried early, was six deep near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a rally.
PLAYFUL SUMMER was off slowly, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start, angled widest through the stretch and had no rally. HERO'S
DAUGHTER chased the early pace, hard ridden into the far turn, raced two deep between and faded. CONDUTTORE hesitated at the break, raced four
wide around the far turn and never threatened. HOPS PETUNIA failed to sustain a bid. GRANADICA dropped back early, raced near the inside to save
ground and never menaced.

Footnotes
TEMPLEMENT pressed the early leader from the outside, took command through the turn and raced well clear through the stretch run under steady
pressure. CONTENT showed good early foot to set the early pace from the inside but was no match for the winner in the drive. MYSTIQUE SABOTEUR
chased the early pace, steadied slightly near the five sixteenths pole, raced three wide through the upper stretch and had not enough for the top pair.
Jockey of Mystique Saboteur claimed objection against Content and stewards ruled no change. BAREBACK FUN was off slowly, waited for racing room
past the five sixteenths pole and raced even late with no closing run. Jockey of Bareback Fun claimed objection on Mystique Saboteur for interference and
stewards ruled no change. SWEET QUEEN BEE raced two wide between near the quarter pole and lacked a bid. AFERDITA stalked the pace and faded
while racing from the outside. CHACALOSA raced off the early going, swung five wide into the upper stretch, angled in and never threatened.

Footnotes
UHAVETOBEKITTENME was rated along early, made a four wide bid through the far turn and finished well to prove best under strong handling. JULIE'S
FERRARI stalked the pace, was blocked nearing the quarter pole, found room to race from the inside and finished gamely to the wire. EXONERATED
PREZ pressed the early pace while racing between rivals early on, experienced traffic deep stretch, angled out and finished willingly to the wire. Jockey of
Exonerated Prez claimed objection against the winner for interference and stewards ruled no change. NOT A GAME pressed outside of foes and weakened
in the drive. STAY THIRSTY AMIGO raced off the early going, raced from the outside in the stretch and had not enough. SCORSESE raced in tight quarters
soon after the start, raced four wide near the quarter pole and had no late rally. REINSURE was slow early to race near the back of the pack early, angled
widest through the stretch run and never threatened. GATTO MARRONE raced with the second flight early, was near the inside around the far turn and
lacked a bid. JOCULARITY showed good early foot to set the pace from the inside and gave way. TURN THE SWITCH dropped back early, raced from the
outside in the lane and never was a factor. HEY SACH failed to sustain a bid and raced far back late.

Footnotes
CHANEL SPIRIT dueled while racing outside of foe and remained clear late under a steady hand ride. SEEYOUINMOTOWN raced off the early going,
moved up two deep past the quarter pole, angled to race five wide inside the upper stretch and was slowly gaining ground on the leader late in a game
effort. PRONTO CHARLI stalked the pace along the inside, hard ridden through the far turn and was no match for the top pair to race along for third.
BONNIE'S BEST was off slowly, rushed from the inside to duel early on and weakened. LADYBUGGIN dropped back to race mid pack and failed to have a
response. VAMONOS PIACENTE settled off the early going, raced along the inside around the far turn and never menaced. KISS VALENTINA pressed the
early pace while racing three wide from the outside of foes and faded. MI CANCION was unhurried early on, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole
and never was a factor. INCREDIBLE MARINI dropped back early, raced near the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch and lacked a bid.
