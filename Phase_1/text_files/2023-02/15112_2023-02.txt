Footnotes
COACH ADAMS close from the start off the inside, took over before a half, clear through the final turn, three wide into the lane, extended that advantage the
final furlong while being kept to task. GOLD BUCKLE settled off the pace toward the inside, chased the winner in the two path into the stretch, proved no
match the final furlong, stayed clear for the place. CASH ROCKET within striking distance while in the three path, lacked a closing response to finish up
evenly, fell after the race and was vanned off. TURFY off a step slow, moved up to race in mid pack along the inside, continued one paced to also lack a
closing bid. SMOKIN BOOTS also off a step slow, failed to menace while racing in the two path. TWITTY CITY fell back to trail after the start, was never a
factor. BAYOU SARGE broke on top, cleared before a quarter along the inside, headed just before a half, briefly pressed the winner then stopped far turn.

Footnotes
MACHO RONNIE away in good order, cleared toward the inside into the first turn, set a modest early pace, continued to show the way through the second
bend along the inside, held the runner up safe late while remaining inside. MAN IN THE CAN broke sharp, relinquished the lead to the winner before a
furlong, pressed that one from the outside up the backstretch and into the far turn, fell back off that rival a bit through the bend, late bid, could not get by.
TWISTED DIXIE chased the top two from along the inside, continued to save ground second bend, managed some gain on that pair late, remained well
clear of the others. BANDIT POINT lacked early foot inside, moved off the rail a bit in the second bend, also managed some modest late gain while not a
serious threat. BIG SUCCESS lacked early foot, steered out four wide turning for home, went evenly through the lane. PROMISING SHOES last away,
trailed for six furlongs, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. MORE THAN BLESSED settled off the pace and the inside, three
wide exiting the final turn, had nothing for the drive. DINNER AT CRUMPIES forwardly placed off rail, floated out four wide onto the backstretch, was
finished after four furlongs.

Footnotes
ALITA in the second flight while racing between foes, advanced and challenged the winner from the outside nearing midstretch, showed the way into the
stretch, edged clear late then held the runner up safe late. KEEN CONTENDER shuffled back just after the start, continued to lack speed into the turn,
began to advance along the inside late in the bend, steered to the far outside for the final furlong, closed well to annex the place while too late for the
winner. TRIBAL SPIRIT in mid pack while off the inside, came three wide for the drive, closest to the winner late, nipped for the second spot late while
between horses at the wire. QUEENIES WAY broke on top, cleared to the inside, set the pace, responded when confronted by the winner in upper stretch,
faltered when headed by the winner a furlong out, lost a couple of positions late. SODDY DAISY in mid pack, steadied in so0me traffic into the turn,
recovered, went evenly through the stretch, not enough for the second spot. FLASH OF CHEROKEE broke in, bumped with SAWYER'S SWEETIE, raced
four wide midway on the turn, lacked a closing kick. FOXPASS back off the pace and the inside, moved out a bit and raced in the two path through the turn,
failed to rlaly. EBBI BLU in the second flight while racing along the rail, steadied when in tight entering the turn, fell back then continued to fade down the
stretch. WINEHOUSE hesitated at the start to spot the field a couple of lengths, trailed and was never a factor. SAWYER'S SWEETIE bumped at the start,
was finished after a half.

Footnotes
TWIRLING TIGRESS broke alertly, showed the way early, dueled through the turn in the two path, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home,
steadily edged clear while kept to pressre. RING TWICE moved up after the start to duel inside the winner into the turn, raced on equal terms with that one
through the bend, could not match strides with that same foe through the stretch, enough left to last for the place. KEY TO SUCCESS last to leave, void of
early foot, trailed along the inside into the bend, brief wait with a quarter mile remaining, got through along the rail, moved out, finished willingly to be closing
the gap on the runner up late. MS HAYLEY lacked speed off the inside, raced three wide through the turn, lacked a closing kick in finishing up evenly posing
no threat to the top three. BACK SEAT BETTY in the second group inside, two path turning for home, began to weaken from between rivals in upper stretch.
RYE MUNNY in the second flight while racing outside, floated out four wide turning for home, faded. PEACH STREET in the second flight while between
rivals turn, gave way entering the stretch while three wide and between horses.

Footnotes
BLOW TORCH broke on top, vied up front toward the inside, dueled far turn, headed, regained the advantage when straightened for home, battled on to be
edging away late. KID SHELLEEN forwardly placed while three wide, early move to duel in the three path backstretch and into the far turn, put a head in
front midway on the final turn, lost the advantage to the winner into the stretch, could not match strides to the wire, far clear of the others. TOAST TO
COAST lacked early foot along the inside, continued to save ground into the far turn, steered out three wide late in that bend, could do little with the top two
in the drive clear of the others. TEQUILA REVOLUTION in some traffic into the first turn, one paced behind the leaders, four wide into the stretch, failed to
muster a rally. STRICKLAND void of speed while four wide into the first turn, angled in a bit to save some ground, angled back out to be four wide late in the
second dturn, improved position without posing any threat. KOSELIO went one paced through while racing off the inside. OUT OF ALCATRAZ lacked speed
while steered out first turn, dropped inside for the second bend, saved ground to no avail. BENISSIMO four wide in the first turn, moved inside second bend,
failed to menace. BLAME IT pinched at the break to be off slowly, never a factor off the inisde. MOURVEDRE stumbled then came in at the break to pinch
back BLAME IT, was righted and used to make the early advantage, vied the next quarter then stopped in the far turn. R R EMPIRE five wide into the first
turn, remained always back, well beaten. TOMMY TRI fractious and unruly leaving the paddock, off slowly, remained far back throughout.

Footnotes
SUPER WONDER GIRL in the second flight while racing three wide, crept closer on the outside late in the turn, saw that progress stall in upper stretch to
fall back off the leader, drifted past the furlong marker then made a late push to be just up at the wire. ARGUMENTAL bobbled slightly then broke in, was
straightened to move up and dueled up front in the two path, shook clear of the other speed by late in the turn, extended that advantage in upper stretch,
could not contain the winner late, clearly second best. BALI DREAMIN in the second flight up the backstretch in the two path, steered out three wide by late
in the bend, no match top two to the wire, all out for the show. SHELL SHOCK lacked early foot off the inside, four wide late in the turn, outkicked late for the
show. RELIANT off a step slow, in the second flight early, fell back before a half. SASSY SAGEY dueled up front inside the runner up, also was finished
before four furlongs.

IBERVILLE four wide into the first turn, raced in mid pack up the backstretch after angling in first turn, steered back out to be four wide when advancing late
in the second bend, kicked well clear under steady handling while drifting slightly. MULBERRY STREET vied early between horses, allowed the leader to
slip well clear the second quarter, rebid in the two path turning for home, proved no match for the winner in the stretch, held sway for the place. HIGHER
AUTHORITY narrowly showed the way into the first turn along the inside, slipped out to a clear lead before a half, offered little resistance to the winner
through the lane, outkicked late for the second spot. MAJOR KONG void of speed inside, continued to save ground second turn, steered out around a tiring
rival late in that bend, continued to display mild interest down the stretch. MR. TIP within striking distance behind the first flight first turn, chased the leader
into the far turn, flattened out through that bend and then weakened through the stretch. CALIFORNIA SWING broke out, raced four wide and back into the
first turn, continued off the rail, angled out a bit to be in the four path again late in the second turn, went flat through the lane to finish up evenly. GEORGIA
DEPUTY broke back, trailed early off the inside, continued back, improved by passing some tiring rivals. ZOFFA settled off the pace and inside, continued to
save ground to no avail through the final turn. MAKE NOISE off a step slow, remained back and made little impact while improving slowly. SEE SPOT RUN

Footnotes
TWO EAGLES RIVER took command after the start inside, rated kindly in the run up the backstretch, shook well clear of a washy closest pursuer into the
far turn, extended that advantage into the stretch and was not threatened to the wire in a sharp effort. DISARM off a step slow, moved up to within striking
distance inside first turn, mid pack backstretch, continued to save some ground second turn, moved out for the drive, proved no match for the winner, clearly
second best. FUNNY UNCLE broke alertly, fell back, trailed before a half, came four wide when making a mild advance late in the second turn, lacked a
further response. RECKER POINT lacked speed, dropped inside, continued to save ground through the second bend, improved a bit while not a serious
threat. WILD MULE within striking distance off the inside, came up empty for the drive. ARMAN Washy, broke in good order, chased the winner for six
furlongs and then gave way down the stretch. DONEGAL FACTOR off a step slow, settled off the pace and the inside, four wide into the lane, failed to rally.

MS CARROLL COUNTY away well, dueled up front up the backstretch in the two path, disposed of the other speed by late in the turn, kicked well clear
through the stretch. NEXT THURSDAY bumped at the start, in mid pack up the backstretch toward the inside, angled out four wide turning for home, proved
no match for the winner, clear for the place. GOLD STRATEGY with the second flight outside, four to five wide turn, finished up best of the rest while not a
threat to the winner. STREET PAINTER bothered, off slowly, moved up to the middle of the pace, strongly split foes when advancing late in the turn,
flattened out in the drive. WILD ROSEY bumped at the break, raced back off the pace toward the inside, four out to five turning for home, improved slightly
