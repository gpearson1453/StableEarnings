Footnotes
MIDNIGHT BELLA prompted the pace in the four path, was driven around the far turn and took aim in the three path entering the lane, and edged past the
inner pacesetter in the final sixteenth to win. SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT bumped with an outer foe at the start, set the pace in the two path, was coaxed
around the far turn and urged right handed along the rail into the stretch, responded well and dug in but was caught by an outer rival late to place.
FRANKIE'S GIRL bumped with an inner foe leaving the gate and had to steady early, trailed in the three path down the backstretch, was ridden around the
far turn and angled out to the five path into the lane, drifted out into the final furlong, and ran on late for show. LUCKY PERIDOT stalked in the three path,
was roused along the rail around the far turn and in the two path entering the stretch, but was short of room thru the stretch, and evened out late. PEACE
SEEKER tracked in the four path early but dropped back to last around the far turn and was no menace.

Footnotes
NO DELIBERATION set the pace along the rail, drifted out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and slightly drifting out through the stretch
run and held safe. RAKA RAKA CRUZ pressed the winner two wide, was herded out in the lane and could not get past. ELUSIVE EMPIRE hit the starting
gate, chased the pace inside, could not gain on the top two but held third in the lane. SOLOMONS GOLD bumped with DERRICKS MEDALLION at the
start, raced four wide and never threatened. DARKDESERTHIGHWAY chased the pace three wide and weakened in the lane. ROARING FIRE veered out
at the start and made little impact while saving ground. DERRICKS MEDALLION was bumped at the start and had only brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
SISTREN was hustled along while in range in the five path, drifted out to the eight path while taking aim turning into the lane, ran on to bid going into the
final furlong and drew past a pair of inner rivals late to win. BOTITA bumped with an inner foe leaving the gate, prompted the pace in the four path, bid
turning into the stretch, and kept on for place. LAW MACHINE bumped with an outer foe out of the gate, then with an inner foe just after, set the pace along
the inside, stayed on entering the lane, began to shorten stride into the final furlong, and yielded to a pair of outer rivals in the final sixteenth to show.
STEPHANIE MY LOVE bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated in the three path, was driven in the five path into the stretch, but was one paced.
QUICKSTYLE bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the two path early and was no factor from the three path in the stretch.
SAMURAI'SDON'TCRY bumped with an outer foe just after the start, chased in the four path but was no threat in the five path in the stretch. MY

Footnotes
HITTING BOMBS trailed in the two path, shifted out down the backstretch and moved up to bid in the five path around the final turn, took over going into the
lane, and drew clear. BORDER WAR was rank between foes in the two path early, settled and rated from said position down the backstretch, was driven
around the final turn and fanned out to the seven path into the stretch, and ran on down the center to get up for place. TYPHOON LAGOON raced
prominently in the three path, was roused into the final turn and briefly led, lost the lead to an outer foe and was under left handed urging from the four path
entering the lane, and was one paced for show. GUARANTEED SPECK stalked along the inside, was ridden around the final turn and tipped out to the four
path into the lane, shifted back in to the two path passing the eighth pole but evened out late. MOST WANTED MAN tracked in the three path, was driven
around the final turn and angled out to the six path at the top of the stretch, but flattened going into the final furlong. MEMORIES R MAGIC set the pace
inside but yielded at the top of the lane. BENKEI prompted the pace in the two path but gaveway around the final turn.

Footnotes
TEMPORA set the pace just off the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. NOBLE DREAMER pressed the winner two wide to upper
stretch, could not gain on that foe but stayed on for the place. WALKS LIKE A LADY stalked the pace from the rail, lacked the needed rally but stayed on
inside to hold third. LOVE MY JOB tracked the pace three wide, edged closer around the turn but was one-paced through the lane. TEMERITY broke
outwardly and bumped KILLARGUE'S GIRL at the start, raced three and four wide and never threatened. KILLARGUE'S GIRL was squeezed back at the
start, raced four and five wide and made little impact. QUEEN CASHMERE was bumped at the start, chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid.

Footnotes
PACHANGA LOCA set the pace inside, opened up around the turn and was cued right handed into the lane, widened her advantage and was much the
best. BLACK BELT BARBIE prompted the pace in the three path, was driven around the turn and under left handed urging from said position going into the
stretch, and held on to place. TRIBUTE rated in the five path, was ridden around the turn and tipped out to the six path entering the lane, and finished
evenly for show. WHEELINGNDEALING appeared to duck in leaving the chute and was steadied early, tracked the pace in the four path but flattened in the
stretch. BEST SELLER broke out and bumped an outer foe, was coaxed along while off the pace in the five path, swung wide into the stretch and never
threatened. HIGH FASHION LADY trailed in the two path early and was never a factor. ANOTHERDAYGONEBY stalked along the inside but faded in the
stretch. EXTRA INDY got bumped by an inner foe out of the gate, chased in the three path but was no menace.

Footnotes
SOUPER ENERGIZER stalked the pace inside, angled three wide near the five-sixteenth marker, seized command in upper stretch, quickly cleared, ducked
to the rail and held safe under a drive. SOUPER COHIBA settled off the early pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, rallied
outside and was up for the place in the final strides. THE MAR settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch, moved into a
clear second leaving the eighth pole, angled into the two path and was nailed for the place. SWING LOW saved ground off the pace, went four wide around
the far turn and rallied belatedly. GLOBES was fractious in the gate, chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. KING ALFREDO pressed the
pace two wide, took the lead midway around the far turn but weakened through the lane. OVER THE CHANNEL set a pressured pace inside and tired in the
lane. CHESS'S DREAM was outrun inside.

Footnotes
PRINCESS THEOREM stalked in the two path, was coaxed while tipping out to the three path turning into the lane, ran on to bid into the final furlong and
drew past the inner pacesetter late to win. GLITTER UP set the pace in the two path, was roused around the far turn and stayed on along the rail in the
stretch, but was caught late by an outer foe to place. FUENTE OVEJUNA (GB) rated in the four path, was urged from the five path turning into the lane, and
kept on for show. AMBITIEUSE was held up off the pace in the three path, was driven in the two path turning into the lane, and improved along the inside of
foes, but just missed minor rewards. FROSTED OATS hit the side of the gate then was bumped by an inner rival, chased in the five path, was ridden around
the far turn and in the seven path entering the stretch, but was no factor. JUMEIRAH broke out and bumped an outer foe, tracked in the four path but
flattened in the six path in the stretch. DAISY BEE prompted the pace in the three path but faded between rivals in the stretch. MANDY GREEN trailed
throughout and went wide in the stretch.
