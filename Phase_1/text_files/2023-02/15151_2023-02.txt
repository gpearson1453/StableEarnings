far turn, no math for winner. GOLDEN RUNNER tracked from inside to far turn, stayed on gamely for show spot. BAMBEROOSKI inside run to quarter pole

only improved position from far turn. VARSITY BLONDE dueled from two path, cleared to far turn, gave way readily. LA VILLAGE LUMIERE had no speed
and never threatened. ROLO BOLO just off rail trip while never a real threat. SPRING LILACS bounced around at the start, slow into stride, never reached
contention. RED LEMONADE inside run to far turn with no response when needed. OPENING ACT outside run to far turn, pulled up to the wire and walked
