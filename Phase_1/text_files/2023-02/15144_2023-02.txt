Footnotes
GIMME CANDY was allowed to settle in the middle of the pack from the inside down the backstretch then made a three wide bid at the quarter pole,
engaged leaders at the top of the stretch and won going away. DIANNA'S JET pressed the pace from the two path was engaged by outside closer at the top
of the stretch, was game down the stretch and saved the place. FROSTED DIAMOND was unhurried around the first turn then moved up on the backstretch
then made a three or four wide bid in the stretch, was out kicked and missed the place. DIXIE PENNY went to a challenged lead from the inside was headed
at the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. CYBER SNEAKER raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then made a three or four wide bid on
the final turn and passed tiring rivals. ABSOLUTELY raced near the back from the three path but was never a factor. VALLEJO was never a threat.
HAMAZING LACE tracked the leader to the five sixteenths pole and faded.

in late stretch. SILKY'S DANCE was two wide on the backstretch, angled inside on the turn to saved ground then made a bid inside in the stretch and was
second best in the end. OGA BEAR set the pressured pace while two wide into the turn, was in a long drive then weakened in the stretch drive. TENOR
chased the early pace while four wide into the turn, made a bid in the stretch then failed to menace. JUSTA BUSTER was settled early while four wide into
the turn, made a mild bid but was no threat. MAD GOLD was saving ground into the turn, stayed inside on the turn then failed to menace in late stretch.
