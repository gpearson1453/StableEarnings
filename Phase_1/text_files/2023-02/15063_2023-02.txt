Footnotes
SHENANDOAH CAT pressured the pace and contested even terms two deep on the turn, dug in for the advantage leaving the sixteenth pole and edged
clear later yards. HANDSOME JOANIE gave close chase through the backstretch, raced in the four path of the turn and dug in to take second in the final
strides. YESSIROFFICER took the lead approaching the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, contested even terms nearest the rail on the turn,
was caught mid-stretch, flattened later yards and just lasted for third. CHURCH KEY gave chase toward the inside, rounded the turn off the rail, dug in to
finish well and just missed third. GOLD PHOENIX chased through the backstretch, raced in the three path of the turn and finished evenly to close the gap. A
BLONDE THING angled to the outside and gave chase, raced in the four path of the turn, moved again to the outside leaving the turn and showed little in
the lane. TINA'S SONG saved ground on the turn.

Footnotes
POSTED took a quick lead and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, cleared Spectaculo passing
the quarter and was steadily handled to hold on well. TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three
eighths pole and rounded the far turn in the two and three paths, dug in from the head of the lane and took the nod for second under the wire.
HERETODAYGONMANANA settled off the pace toward the inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and was
nipped from second under the wire. SPECTACULO stalked from the three path, challenged nearing the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back past the
quarter, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth. MASTER YOO rounded the opening turn in the three path, gave chase nearing the
seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn, his rider lost his whip leaving the eighth pole and showed little more. AIR MEDAL was not a factor.
PONTICELLO was not a factor.

Footnotes
SOME IS NINE took over while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, was urged away from the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and
was steadily handled through the stretch. MIZZEN saved ground on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and
dueled through the stretch for second. AWESOME INCENTIVE settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
raced two deep on the far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. ROSELEE stalked the early pace off the rail, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn then flattened in the lane. MISS COREY raced boxed at the rail on the first turn,
gave chase from the half mile pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little in the lane. PRACTICALLY THERE saved ground. CODAS
HONOR never factored and raced in the three path of the far turn. HELLUVA LADY rounded the opening turn about the five path, faded leaving the turn and

Footnotes
DECISIVE CAUSE rounded the opening turn in the six path and started an outside bid into the backstretch, raced close off the rail through the far turn, dug
in to take the lead in later yards and ran clear nearing the wire. KOBE'S GIRL took over and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure
leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, was steadily handled leaving the turn but was met, and relented in later yards. VICTORY
ROYALE saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn and
just lasted for third. BOCA BIRDIE saved ground well off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and steadily improved at the rail on the far turn,
steadied in tight quarters at the rail nearing mid-stretch, though, finished evenly. CHANNEL SCENT raced well back saving ground on the first turn, picked
up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, eased out nearing the head of the lane, but lugged in under right hand
encouragement and steadied nearing mid-stretch. EXCUSES EXCUSES rated close inside, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
at the rail and weakened in the lane. LOVE TO ZOOM rounded the opening turn in the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then
weakened in the four path of the far turn. WALK A FINE LINE raced in the seven path the first turn, left the turn outside and showed little response.
DYLADDIE raced off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn. CAN I GET AN AMEN
became fractious in the gate, raced in the five path on the first turn and left the turn toward the outside, showed little response through the backstretch and
was eased the final quarter.
