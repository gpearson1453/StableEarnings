Footnotes
EYE CANDY RANDY broke sharply to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and was ridden
out to the wire. DALE'S ADDICTION was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. BLUE
PARADISE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished with a belated bid. SEAFARING
WILDCAT pressed the pace while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. SUPER INTENSE was pinched back at the start, lagged early,
raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. HERMISTON was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
OUR BOY ROY was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with HE'S A CANDY MAN while racing three-wide, opened a clear lead with a
furlong to run and drew off with complete authority. KATAR settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run
and finished with good late energy. ECHO CANYON lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with a late rally. HI YAH pressed the
pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter and gave way in the drive. CONRADO was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide
through the turn and failed to gain late. NOBLE CRUSADER was off slow, lagged early, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. HE'S A
CANDY MAN broke sharply to dispute the pace from the inside, weakened after the opening quarter, was eased pulled up before the finish and vanned off.

Footnotes
ALLEVA was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and was ridden out to the wire.
CANDY ZIP broke sharply to duel for the lead with the winner from off the rail, angled out into the stretch, was no match for that rival but finished well to hold
the place. FATHER O'FLAHERTY was allowed to settle early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. FIRE WHEN READY was
void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and failed to gain late. SPEEDING STYLE pressed the pace from
between foes and weakened after going three furlongs. FRANKS FIX IT was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened.
MYSTICAL IMAGE lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

late. SHORT JOURNEY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with good energy.
HERSABIGGIRL was reserved just off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn, drifted in with a furlong to run and finished evenly. EDDIE'S ON
PATROL raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. FOREST ACCLAMATION was away in good
order to dispute the pace with the winner while racing four-wide and gave way after going a half. MISS WHISKEY was off slow, lacked early foot, raced
four-wide through the turn and did not threaten. MARK OF VICTORY showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and did not reach

BLUE AZUL sprinted clear soon after the start, raced four-wide while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off through lane as
a handy winner. EROTIC was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but
finished well to hold the place. RUN TAPPY was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished with a belated bid. TALKIN
MALICE raced four-wide through the first turn, chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way after going six furlongs. ITS BIG settled off the
leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. MANY ROSES chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after
going three quarters. JAKE THE GREAT lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the second turn and did not menace. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT was off
slow, raced unhurried early, moved six-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. MORE ACTION raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the second turn, weakened and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
CATS TOUCH was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to take command with a sixteenth to run and held off the closing ARIZONA
JEREMY to prevail. ARIZONA JEREMY settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and rallied late. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE was
void of early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out with a furlong to run and finished with good late energy. PISTOL POWER was
forwardly placed early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter, led and gave way in the drive. REDACTION settled off the leaders early,
moved five-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed rally. DEVIL'S TEETH sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and
weakened after going three-quarters. CAPTAIN RED lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the lane and did
not offer a bid. WINNING MAGIC chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.
