Footnotes
HOP AND SCOTCH bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, settled in the middle of the pack on the rail for the run up the backstretch, navigated
the turn from the two path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and got up for the win late. BARAK led the way on the inside up the backstretch,
continued to show the way while racing in the two path around the bend and dueled gamely in the lane, getting caught near the wire. BIG BUCKSALOT
tracked the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the three path around the turn and dueled gamely the length of the
stretch, getting caught in the final strides. UNXPECTED TIGER stumbled leaving the gate, raced off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the
bend, and improved position mildly in the lane while never threatening the top three. ALTAIR pressed the pace between horses through the opening quarter
of a mile, navigated the turn from the three path and weakened in the stretch. RED'S MR Z bumped with the horse to his inside at the break, raced in the
middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the bend in the three path and made no bid. ICETECA trailed the field up the
backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
WISHIN N KISSIN raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn, kicked clear
entering the stretch and was geared down at the wire. ONE TOUGH DAME raced off the pace on the inside early, navigated the bend from the two path,
began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground in the stretch while proving to be no match for the winner. REBEL CONSORT raced in the middle
of the pack between horses up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the four path and finished evenly. BEAST BUNNY bumped with the horse to
her outside leaving the gate, dueled up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path around the bend and weakened in the lane. HIGH DONNA
bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, settled off the pace for the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the four and five path and
made no bid. SARA KALI tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faded in the stretch. JAZHARA dueled
between horses in the early going, dropped back while racing in the three path around the turn and continued to tire from there.

HANNITA'S EMPIRE chased the leader up the backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn, challenged approaching the quarter pole and drew off in
the lane. BEAUTIFUL TIZ raced off the pace on the inside early, began to move up from the four path coming around the turn and gained ground in the
stretch. READY TO FILM raced in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the bend from the three path and improved
position mildly in the lane. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE opened up a clear early lead, continued to show the way from the two path around the turn and
weakened in the stretch. DRILL'S VALENTINE raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and finished
evenly while never threatening. RAPIDAMENTE raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and
made no bid. CALENDULA raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the early going, dropped back from the two path coming around the bend and
was empty from there. KERIK trailed the field throughout, saved ground and was never a factor. PER THE FLORIDA RACING COMMISSION, HANNITAS
EMPIRE HAS BEEN DQ'D FOR A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
RONSTADT saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the far bend and
dueled to the wire to just get his nose in front. GREAT BRITAIN saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, challenged from
the two path around the far turn and dueled gamely to the wire to just miss. BATTLE SCARS raced at the back of the pack in the two path through the
opening half mile, saved ground around the far turn, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late to just miss. SOCIALLONGDISTANCE
raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace, began to move up from the three path coming around the second turn
and continued to improve position late. VINTNER raced in the middle of the pack on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the
far bend from the two path and finished evenly. GO MIKE saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the
backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and was outkicked in the lane. JUSTINTIMEFORWINE led the way while saving ground around
the first bend, opened up on the field racing up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn and tired in the final furlong. CONSTANT
KNIGHT bobbled slightly leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch and around the second bend
and was empty in the stretch. ROCK THE STARS veer out mildly at the break, saved ground early, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch,
navigated the far turn from the two path and was not a factor.

around the turn in the three path, was outkicked entering the stretch and ran on again to gain ground late. BIG JOHN chased the pace setters on the outside
up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, challenged entering the stretch and flattened out from there. COX CANYON bumped with the horse to his
inside and was pinched back leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch and into the turn, swung into the stretch in the six path and never
threatened. GRAND MACALLAN raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the opening stages, continued around the turn in the five path and
