Footnotes
FRENCHIES GOLD took the lead at the thirteen sixteenths pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled to hold on well. SPARKLEINYOUREYE rated close inside on the opening turn, started a three
wide bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and had to settle for second. JACKYSINTHECASTLE saved ground off the pace,
picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, flattened in the lane and just lasted for third. CLOUD MOVER saved
ground well off the pace on the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and just
missed third in an even finish. SNEAKY LYNK stalked from the three path the first turn, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded past the five
sixteenths. LOCKDOWN VANNA stalked the pace in the three and four paths the first turn, left the turn outside and faded past the seven sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
URBAN BANDIT settled in the three path the first turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole and improved at the rail on the far turn, eased out to
take aim at COLLECTORATE nearing the head of the lane, dug in leaving the turn, lugged in and made light contact with that one and took the nod in the
final strides. The latter rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and dueled clear toward the quarter, rounded the far turn
at the rail, dug in under steady stretch handling but was brushed late and missed the nod. ELFUEGOMASBRILANTE saved ground on the first turn, picked
up the chase leaving the half mile pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, then dueled through the stretch for third. ARROGANT RIDER settled off the
early pace about the four path and left the first turn outside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced two deep on the far turn then relented in the stretch
duel for third. MR MAJESTIC stalked three wide on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded through the far turn. MALIBU
ROCK STAR hesitated leaving the gate, saved ground on the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch. BUY HERE PAY HERE
stalked two deep then challenged approaching the three eighths pole, but dropped back toward the quarter and weakened leaving the far turn. The
Stewards reviewed, then dismissed, a claim of foul against the rider of Urban Bandit for interference in late stretch, lodged by the rider of Collectorate.

Footnotes
GRAND FIBER chased inside, raced close at the rail on the turn, took the lead approaching the head of the lane and ran clear leaving the turn, dug in under
steady handling and held on. FREEDOM IS RINGING chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, dueled for second toward
mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner. FU MAN SUE was hustled through the opening quarter and drew to even terms at the five sixteenths pole,
contested the turn off the rail, bore out approaching the head of the lane but came back to claim third. GRUMPELSTILTSKIN chased toward mid track,
rounded the turn about the six path, left the turn outside and improved his position. SHACKLEFORDS STORM set a pressured pace the opening quarter
mile, was met at the five sixteenths pole and contested even terms off the rail on the turn, but dropped back leaving the turn and weakened. ROSE'S
GALAXY gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the three path and showed little more. SHACKLED chased through the backstretch, raced
in the five path of the turn and showed little in the lane. DOESN'T MAKE CENTS gave chase outside and raced in the six path of the turn.
