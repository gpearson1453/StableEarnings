PERFECT HIDEAWAY set the pace while two wide, shook clear on the turn, then was challenged leaving the turn and dug in gamely to hold sway late,
driving. BARISTA VIXEN was reserved and was four to five wide on the backstretch, made a four wide move on the turn, loomed boldly off the turn but hung
in the lane, held place award. ONE MORE KELLY was rated along the inside, angled out in the lane and had a late rally to just miss the place award. IRIE
EMPRESS was allowed to settle on the inside, came five wide into the lane and rallied well late. BONITA LASSIE pressed the early pace three wide, then
chased the pace on the inside on the far turn and weakened. ANNA ROCKS was rated along three wide, came five wide into the lane and had no rally.
AMI'S LINK was settled early, between rivals by the half mile marker, five wide on the turn and lacked a rally. JEANETTEO was four wide into the first turn,
stalked the pace four wide, then was three wide on the far turn and tired.

SAKARI set the pace while clear in the two path, was well handled on the front end and drew out in the lane to prove much the best under right handed crop
urging. TILTED TIARA was rated early, shifted out and was four wide nearing the half mile marker while advancing, then made a bid three wide on the turn
but could not get to the winner and flattened out late, second best. FUELED UP tracked the pace on the inside and weakened, held show award.
BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY was reserved early on the inside, eased out on the turn while advancing and came four wide into the lane, needed a rally and just
missed the show award. SIMPLE JUSTICE was void of early speed and then found best tride late on the inside. CRIMSON LILLE was settled three to four
wide and tired. FULL OF ATTITUDE stalked the pace three wide and then stopped.
