Footnotes
TECATE GOLD sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, responded when challenged by PRINCESS JAYLEEN nearing the
five-sixteenths marker, opened a clear margin into the lane and held PHOENICIAN MAGIC safe late. PHOENICIAN MAGIC broke sharply to stalk the
leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied with the winner but could not gain on that rival in the drive. PRINCESS
JAYLEEN chased the winner while racing four-wide, moved up to engage that foe nearing the five-sixteenths marker and gave way in the drive. LILY PAD
LAKE was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. MISS CONTINENTAL showed no early speed, raced
four-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and did not offer a bid. NO CAUSE TO DOUBT was void of early speed, raced off the rail
through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
INESPERADO sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and held sway to the wire. LIMITED
HEATWAVE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with good
energy. AGADOR SPARTACUS chased the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter and way in the drive.
AMADMADWORLD settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. ROYAL JOKER raced off the leaders early,
moved three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. ROBIN'S EMPIRE was off slow, showed no early speed, saved ground through the second
turn and did not menace. DODGER BLUE was off a step slow, lagged was pulled up after going a quarter and vanned off.

Footnotes
NASHVILLE SKYLINE sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority. THE RONALD
chased the winner while racing three-wide throughout and failed to gain on that rival in the drive. BARON'S SONG tracked the winner from the inside
throughout and lacked the needed late response. CAPACITY was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved seven-wide through the turn and finished
evenly late. CARRIZO SPRINGS settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. PANZER PRIDE lacked early
foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and was not a factor. LIL KOWBOY was void of early speed, saved ground
through the turn and did not offer a bid. CORK MASTER lagged throughout.

Footnotes
THE PUBLIC HALO pressed the pace of the dueling leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths marker, opened
a clear lead with a quarter to run and drew off as the easiest of winners. ZATTER dueled for the lead from the inside with DIAMOND WILLOW, was no
match for the winner in the drive but finished well to be clearly second best. WARFRONT FIGHTER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide
through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. GOLDEN COWBOY lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with some late run.
DIAMOND WILLOW disputed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. ARIMONY showed no early speed, raced five-wide through
the turn and did not menace. FOREVER GOLD raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
FAIRY TALE BLISS settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenths pole and
quickly drew off. SECRET MISTRESS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, failed to match strides with the
winner in the drive but finished well to hold the place. FAT AND FURIOUS broke in the air, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second
turn, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. BARBIE WARS lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished
evenly. LADY LANA raced four-wide through the first turn, stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, gained a brief lead and gave way in the drive.
BOISTEROUSLY IRISH sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and weakened after going a half. UNSINKABLE MOLLY B raced off
the pacesetters from the inside and gradually weakened. LOTSA LACE lacked early speed, raced between foes through the back-stretch, steadied nearing
the three-eighths marker and was eased through the lane.
