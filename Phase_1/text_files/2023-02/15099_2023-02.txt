Footnotes
NOBLE HONOR set the pace from the start, was in steady drive down the backstretch into the second turn, then drew clear in late stretch proving best.
ELUSIVEDESTINATION stalked the pace between rivals down the backstretch, then drop back slightly entering the far turn, re bid in the upper stretch and
closed strong for the place prize. LOOPY DUDE chased the pace from the inside from the first turn into the second turn, then rallied in the upper stretch to
close well for the show prize. O T C WIZ stalked the pace from the four path down the backstretch, then rallied on the far turn while three wide and
continued to close well but it was not enough. MY CALANTE chased the pace while two wide, was in a steady drive down the backstretch into the second
turn, came out five wide to bid in the home stretch but it was too little too late. WEST JET stalked the leader from the two path, was in a long drive the first
three quarters, was used up on the far turn and weakened in the stretch. WAY TOO WINDY stumbled at the start then trailed behind the field and needed
rally.
