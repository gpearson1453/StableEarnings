Footnotes
BIG STICK tracked the early pace, was well placed into the turn, roused nearing the quarter marker, made a two wide bid into the stretch run, closed the
gap on RACER REX inside of the furlong pole and kept to task in deep stretch to prove best. RACER REX stalked the decent early pace, pressured ONE
BIG SMILE nearing the quarter marker and took command in upper stretch, was set down for the drive, could not hold off BIG STICK inside of the furlong
marker and held safely in the end for second. COLONEL VARGO hard to load, was away in good order and showed early speed, stalked the pace to the
turn, lost position two wide nearing the quarter marker, swung four wide into the stretch run, re-rallied in deep stretch and was up for third in the final stages.
ONE BIG SMILE sent to establish the early lead, set decent fractions to the turn, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, drifted out at the top of
the lane and raced in the four path into the drive, chased to mid-stretch and was outfinished for show. LATE NITE OUT shuffled back at the start and was off
slowly, trailed into the turn, saved ground to the top of the lane and lacked a late rally. WEE BEASTIE chased the decent early pace, lost position three wide
on the turn, swung five wide for the drive and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
POLLO D'ORO crowded TRIPLE E at the start but was away in good order and was sent to the early lead, set solid fractions to the turn, drew to a clear lead
nearing the quarter marker, extended the lead to mid-stretch, kept to task in the late stages and was geared down in the final strides as much the best.
TRIPLE E crowded at the start by POLLO D'ORO and was away a step slowly, took back off of the fast early pace and was content to trail to the turn, raced
four wide to the quarter marker, swung widest for the drive, closed in the late stages, was no match for the winner in deep stretch and was best of the rest.
FINE SOFT MORNING forwardly placed in the early going, chased the pace from the inside on the turn, weakened in the drive and held safely for show.
AFFIRM CHIEF chased the solid early pace while outside of rivals, raced four wide on the turn, lost position in upper stretch, was a bit hard to place in the
stretch run and could not muster a response in the final stages. THECHIEFHASTRICKS lacked early speed, saved ground on the turn and did not threaten.
VIVA LEON JODIDO showed early speed, chased the fast pace while two wide between rivals on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the
late stages. GRIFFITH PARK chased the fast early pace, raced three wide between runners on the turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch and faltered in
the stretch run.

GREAT STORY was away quickly, cleared the field and angled to the rail, rated kindly then opened up on the field turning for home and drew off under mild
encouragement. HUNTERS GHOST broke well but was beaten to the lead then caught in tight a quarter mile in, awaited room them moved off the rail in the
clear for the run though the turn, tipped four wide into the stretch, could not keep pace with the winner in the final stages and just held for second. OUR
EXPECTATION took back off of the quick early fractions, raced outside of rivals to the quarter marker, mounted a five wide rally into the drive, closed well
and just missed for place, while clear of the rest for show. SATANTA one of the first into stride but outrun early, saved ground through the turn, started a
mild bid near the three furlong marker then came into the stretch three wide, attempted a rally but was unable to make an impact. HE BE MOJO RISIN
broke well and was up close in the early stages, was crowed a bit by GREAT STORY early then chased that one around the turn while two wide, was
unable to catch the eventual winner, tired, and had nothing to offer down the lane.

Footnotes
GROSS PROFIT unhurried in the early stages, raced two wide to the quarter marker, swung widest and circled the field to go six wide into the stretch run,
was full of run in upper stretch, collared MICKEY GOLDMILL nearing the furlong marker, was a bit green in deep stretch but drew away in the final sixteenth
to be much the best. MICKEY GOLDMILL assumed a tracking position in the early going, made a three wide steady advance into the far turn, chased
PERFORMATIVE to the quarter marker, battled with that rival to mid-stretch, was no match for the winner in deep stretch and ran on to hold for place.
UNCLE WALT allowed to settle in the early stages, raced four wide into the second turn, mounted a three wide bid into the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch,
could not keep pace with GROSS PROFIT in the final stages and stayed on to secure the show. PERFORMATIVE away in good order, engaged with
ALMONT in the early stages and dueled with that rival through solid fractions to the half-mile marker, shook free nearing the quarter marker, was confronted
by MICKEY GOLDMILL in upper stretch and battled to the furlong grounds, could not match strides with oncoming rivals in the final stages and gave way.
UPDRAFT forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the solid pace from a rail path through the backstretch run, came in tight entering the far turn, could
not keep pace in the drive and weakened in the final stages. EYESA SPECIAL took back off of the solid early pace, raced five wide into the far turn and did
not threaten. DADDY'SDARLINGBOY unprepared at the start and was away slowly, lagged through the backstretch run and was not a factor. ALMONT
stumbled leaving the break, was hustled to be prominent into the first turn, pressed the solid fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure
nearing the top of the lane and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
MORE POWER TO HIM tracked the moderate early pace, slipped to the inside for the run along the backstretch, advanced from the inside on the far turn,
angled three wide leaving the quarter marker, gained ground in upper stretch, overtook the pacesetter inside of the furlong pole, felt pressured from
WELLSWORT nearing the sixteenth-marker, dug in under firm handling in the final stages and determinedly prevailed. WELLSWORT (IRE) content to trail
in the early stages, raced three wide through the backstretch run, was roused leaving the three-furlong pole, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch run,
closed well into mid-stretch, came within aim of MORE POWER TO HIM nearing the sixteenth-marker, battled to the final strides and was gamely bested on
the wire. THE CALABRESE KID away in good order and was sent to dictate terms in the early stages, cleared the field the first time by and angled to the
inside for the run into the clubhouse turn, rated nicely into the backstretch run and set modest fractions to the far turn, led into the drive, held foes at bay to
mid-stretch, weakened in the final stages and held safely in the end for the show. AGENT ZERO tracked the moderate early pace, advanced three wide into
the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch and finished evenly in the final furlong. CANYON CREST unhurried in the early stages, raced two wide to the
half-mile pole, came three wide into the far turn, angled to the inside and advanced in upper stretch, could not sustain that run in the final stages and
flattened out. IMPLICITLY stalked the moderate early pace, chased the pacesetter through modest fractions along the backstretch run, maintained position
while two wide nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace in the drive and tired.

Footnotes
EFFECTIVE GIG allowed to settle in the early going, advanced nearing the far turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker, came in tight and lacked room
nearing the top of the lane, shifted four wide for the drive, caught NORTHERN JEWEL approaching the furlong pole and drew clear in the final sixteenth.
NORTHERN JEWEL forwardly placed into the first turn, raced closest to the top pair through the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn, came within
aim nearing the quarter marker, took command in upper stretch, came under pressure nearing the furlong pole, could not hold off EFFECTIVE GIG and was
not able to keep pace with the winner in deep stretch but stayed on to be second best. SNAKE ISLAND asked to show early speed, engaged with WOLF'S
LIFE along the first turn and pressed that rival through solid fractions to the half-mile marker, kept pressure on the pacesetter to the quarter marker, lost
ground in upper stretch to NORTHERN JEWEL, chased that foe to the furlong pole, weakened in the late stages and was clear in the end for third.
MIQUEAS bobbled at the start, lacked early speed, made a steady advance along the backstretch run and into the far turn, came within aim nearing the
quarter marker, swung six wide for the drive, was outrun in the final furlong and passed tiring rivals in the late stages. HOT ROD JIMMY tracked the solid
early pace, stalked the fractions through the backstretch run, advanced four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the drive and gave way in the stretch
run. WOLF'S LIFE away in good order and was sent to establish the early lead, engaged with SNAKE ISLAND along the first turn and set solid fractions
while pressured through the backstretch run, held the lead to the quarter marker, could not keep pace in upper stretch and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
ZAZEN crowded at the start by LAGATHA and was off a bit slowly, was rushed to contention heading to the turn, came within aim while saving ground
nearing the quarter marker, came in a bit tight while advancing nearing the furlong pole, took command inside of the furlong marker and kicked away under
steady urging in the final sixteenth. MARILYN'S SMILE settled off of the fast early pace, advanced from a rail position on the turn, angled three wide for the
stretch run, loomed in mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final stages by ZAZEN and stayed on to be second best. REDSTWIRLINGDANCER broke sharply
and sped to the early lead, showed good speed while setting solid fractions through the turn, came under pressure nearing mid-stretch, could not keep pace
with the top pair in the final stages and held for third. LAGATHA prominent in the early stages, chased her stablemate through fast fractions to the quarter
marker, advanced to come within aim in mid-stretch, could not make headway in the final furlong and gave way. A NEW PEACE took back in the early
stages, advanced two wide on the turn, was steered four wide into the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not offer a late response. TIP TOP GAL took
up at the start and was away slowly, trailed to the turn, raced four wide into the stretch run and closed willingly in the final furlong while unable to threaten.
MUCHA WOMAN forwardly placed in the early going, chased the fast pace to the turn, lost position while two wide approaching the quarter marker, ran
evenly to the furlong pole and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
MR. MASON took up slightly leaving the break but was away in good order, tracked the fast early pace, raced two wide between rivals into the turn, was
asked for run nearing the quarter marker and mounted a four wide rally into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong pole, closed fast in the final furlong,
responded to steady urging in deep stretch and determinedly kept to task to get up in the final strides for the win. SHARONA'S WILD BOY rated off of the
fast early pace while not far back, advanced from the inside on the turn, angled three wide for the drive, gained ground nearing mid-stretch, continued that
advance and came within aim nearing the sixteenth-marker, vied between runners in the final strides and just missed for the win, while earning the nod for
the place. ENCODE was away in good order, ceded the early lead to LUCKY LAD and stalked that rival through quick early fractions, advanced to press the
fast pace to the quarter marker, battled with LUCKY LAD to mid-stretch, came to even terms inside of the furlong pole, vied between runners in deep stretch
and was just edged out by the oncoming top pair, while holding for show. LUCKY LAD showed good early speed and assumed command in the opening
stages, set fast fractions to the turn, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, battled with ENCODE to mid-stretch, dug in gamely in the final sixteenth,
vied from the inside in deep stretch and was edged out for the win and minor awards. BLAZING JAMIE chased the fast early pace, raced three wide
between rivals into the turn, lost ground in upper stretch, re-rallied and offered a late bid in deep stretch but was outkicked in the final stages. TOLONISITO
was bothered at the start and was away a step slowly, trailed in the early stages, saved ground into the turn, raced two wide into the drive, advanced in
upper stretch, was boxed in in mid-stretch, continued to be blocked into deep stretch and finished evenly. TALBOT BAY chased the fast early pace, raced
outside of rivals on the turn, came four wide into the stretch run, lost ground in upper stretch, re-rallied in the late stages but was unable to offer the needed
response.

Footnotes
UNION GIG broke well and clear of the trouble to his inside at the break, was content to cede the lead and took up a tracking position while rating kindly on
the rail mid-pack and well behind the early leader, was let loose passing the three furlong marker, responded when set down for the stretch run and
outfinished a stubborn rival to the inside, gaining the advantage in the final yards. MACHO CHROME broke out at the start and made mutual contact with
DAD BOD then was pushed to get forward position going into the first turn, took a two wide path while easily gaining the early advantage, opening up a bit
on the backstretch run while setting comfortable fractions on an uncontested lead, was challenged to the outside by UNION GIG at the head of the stretch,
battled that one gamely the length of the stretch run and just came up short in the last few jumps. TEX HANLEY was sandwiched after the break and was
forced to steady for a few strides, raced well behind the pace while under a light hold through the first turn, had to wait for racing room through the far turn,
took the rail path into the stretch, rallied strongly and was rapidly gaining on the top pair at the wire. CARSON'S LEGACY tried to avoid SKY DINSKI after
the break and came in on TEX HANLEY, settled near the rear of the field, raced three wide throughout, launched a sustained bid from with three furlongs to
go and finished best of the rest. CHRIS FIX lacked early speed, rated in the back of the field to the far turn, began a sustained rally from last approaching
the five-sixteenths pole, swung five wide into the stretch, ducked in sharply while racing on the wrong lead and into the path of SKY DINSKI, ended up on
the rail for the last sixteenth of a mile and was making up ground in the end. DAD BOD broke in at the start and made mutual contact with MACHO
CHROME, raced close up while three wide on both turns, launched a bid from near the five-sixteenths pole that faltered mid-stretch. ZIPPY BABY close up
and two or three wide through the first turn, raced mid-pack while wide down the backstretch, bid from the three furlong pole, came four wide into the stretch
but faltered when unable to change leads. SKY DINSKI ducked in after the start into the path of CARSON'S LEGACY, lost some ground while trying to
correct, was left to chase the field from the rear, racing in tandem with CHRIS FIX for three furlongs, pulled away from that one and began to improve
position going into the far turn then was stuck behind horses to mid-stretch, got a clear path near the eighth pole only to get bumped by a rank CHRIS FIX
and lost all chance to improve position. HICKORY WIND broke out some after the break making contact with TEX HANLEY, forcing that one to have to
steady, was rank and wide through the clubhouse turn, pulled the rider to a close-up tracking position down the backstretch, was still in contention at the
three furlong pole but was unable to keep up when the pace quickened and was not persevered with from there.
