Footnotes
MR. B CAUSE was forwardly placed in the two path down the backstretch then made a four wide bid at the three sixteenths pole and engaged the leader
after the eighth pole to prevail. OXXON went to a clear lead through the final turn then was collared after the eighth pole but fought gamely to the wire.
INDEFENSIBLE was unhurried down the backstretch then moved up from four wide around the final turn, going six or seven wide in upper stretch for a late
rally. NATE'S REVENGE raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then moved between horses at the five sixteenths pole and flattened out in
the stretch drive. HIGHTAIL COWBOY stalked the pace from the three path to the eighth pole but lacked the late response. ESCROW STYLE was pinched
after the start, was allowed to settle while racing in the middle of the pack but failed to menace. BAQUERO'S BIND was forwardly placed on the inside to the
top of the stretch and weakened. CPRIORITY was off the pace in the two path to the top of the stretch and gave way. SERBIAN SAILOR was always back.
SHOT ON WINDY HILL saved ground to no avail.

MR. WIMBLEDON BAY went to a clear lead and set all the pace to prove much the best. CLEVER PRINCE was unhurried around the first turn then moved
up the rail through the final turn, kept on and secured the place with late effort. PROUDTOWN popped the gate open prior to the start then was hustled
along to vied for the lead to the three eighths pole then chased the leader around the final turn and tired. CATINANDSCATIN tracked the leaders around the
first turn then made a rail bid around the final turn, had to move out to two wide in upper stretch and faltered. OUT MAKING TREBLE raced in the middle of
the pack from off the rail down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the final turn and finished evenly. MR. SNOWFLAKE was within striking distance but
failed to menace. PRODUCTION TIME was off the pace in the three path to the quarter pole and retreated. DARING DARIAN was allowed to settle down
the backstretch but was not a factor. SABER STORM raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch and retreated. SASSI ASPEN showed little.

middle of the pack down the backstretch then made a three or four wide bid on the final turn to make a late run to be up for the place. FLASHING
ANGELBABY pressed the pace from the two path around the first turn then followed the lead down the backstretch and weakened. GETCHA was off the
pace on the inside but was one paced throughout. TAKEN BACK raced near the back around the first turn then moved up on the backstretch but was not a
threat. HARDCORE FOLKLORE raced near the back around the first turn made a mild bid but was not a threat. FREEDOMFI raced in the middle of the
pack while saving ground but was not a factor. GUITARZAN vied for the lead around the first turn, tracked the leader down the backstretch from the three

SCARLETTSBLACKJACK went to a pressured lead down the backstretch then inched away on the final turn and drew off in the stretch. PINCH ASSAULT
was unhurried around the first turn then moved up from three wide at the three eighths pole, gave a late kick in the stretch to be up for the place. SAMMY
DANSEUR JR. vied for the lead from the three path through the final turn but lacked a late response and missed the place. LUCK OF THE DRAW was
allowed to settle down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the final turn to improve position. SPEAKTOMEOFLOVE pressed the pace from the two path
to the quarter pole and gave way. INTO WISHING raced in the middle of the pack but was not a factor. JACK BOB AND LARRY raced in the middle of the
pack but was not a threat. CITY PARK never contended.

Footnotes
PIPES AND DRUMS raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then made a four wide bid at the five sixteenths, ran down the leaders and had a
late stretch duel but won the nod. STRONG EAGLE was off the pace around the first turn then made a four wide bid at the three eighths pole to engage the
leader at the quarter pole and took the lead at the eighth pole but was collared by outside closer at the sixteenth pole and dueled to the wire but lost the
nod. JIMI'S A STAR was unhurried around the first turn then steadily advanced down the backstretch, made a three wide bid on the final turn but had to
move out to five wide in upper stretch to make a late rally but was too late. COSMIC TRAIN raced near the back down the backstretch then moved up from
the two path for a late run but was not enough. GET THEM JUSTIN raced in the middle of the pack to the first turn then made a rail bid around the first turn
and tracked the leaders down the backstretch moved out to three wide at the three eighths pole to make a bid but hung. SUPER DESIGN vied for the lead
from the three path and engaged the leader at the quarter pole, fought gamely to the sixteenth pole and tired. FIGURETI (CHI) went to a pressured lead
from between horses, was collared at the quarter pole and gave way. MINNESOTA MIRACLE was always back. MILITARY BEARING pressed the pace
from the inside to the seven sixteenths pole and retreated.

Footnotes
SILVER CHALICE went to a clear lead to set all the pace and was kept to task in the stretch drive. STYLING HOOK stalked the pace from the two path but
was no match for the winner and was a clear second. BAD DECISIONS raced in the middle of the pack to the final turn then made a three wide bid moving
out farther to the four or five wide into upper stretch for a late rally to be up for the show. STORMIN SUNDAY was within striking distance through the final
turn then made a rebid to improve position late. FLAT OUT FABIO was forwardly placed around the first turn then made a middle move on the backstretch
and was out finished. AWESOME CAJUN was off the pace to the three eighths pole and weakened. MULETRAIN saved ground to no avail. CLASSIC
RUNNER raced near the back around the first turn then made a middle move on the backstretch but faltered. ACCEL JOE never contended. DRINKIN
DOUBLE showed little.
