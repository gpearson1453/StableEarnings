FAR HEART controlled the pace in hand, widened on the final turn and dominated her field while ridden out. LORD JOAN stalked the pace outside, made a
brief bid on the final turn and tired proving no match for the winner. CINNAMON DREAM trailed along the inside, angled out in the stretch and finished
willingly. CASH ON FIRST prompted the winner along the inside for half a mile and faded. ROLIN N CONTROLIN settled just off the leaders three wide and
stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
TACO BEAN pressed the pace in the early stages, then chased on the turn, closed the gap turning for home, rallied outside of WISPERING SPRINGS in
the stretch, collared that rival nearing the sixteenth marker and drew clear for the win. PORSUPUESTO stalked three wide, chased three wide on the turn,
closed well late outside and got up for second. EMINENCY raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane, moved up between rivals, angled in and
closed late inside for third. WISPERING SPRINGS set the pace on the inside, shook free, dueled with the winner to midstretch, then weakened late.
WEGOTTAGUY stalked two wide, chased on the turn, lacked a winning bid and raced evenly in the stretch. ANGELUS DIAMOND chased on the inside and
tired. TEQUILA JR raced off the rail, off the pace and was outrun. LAYNES KNIGHT raced off the pace inside, stumbled badly and fell in upper stretch,
walked off. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the incident, the race was declared official.

IT'S GAME TIME set a measured pace, widened in the stretch and remained safe in a driving finish. NIGHT OPS raced just off pace between foes, bid on
the final turn and continued gamely. CELTIC TREASURE chased between rivals, faded on the final turn then came again in the stretch. NICK
PAPAGIORGIO saved ground within range, rallied on the final turn then faltered. SOCIAL GROUP moved just off the leaders four wide and weakened after
half a mile. JUMP FOR ALEX trailed for five furlongs, moved wide and lacked a rally. VIKRAM prompted the winner to the far turn and gave way readily.

SON OF A SAINT was a bit fractious in the gate, off slowly, pulled close up on the rail on the clubhouse turn, tracked, made a rail bid at the half mile marker,
dueled, took over on the far turn and drew clear under urging. LONG GRAY LINE raced off the pace between rivals, saved ground on the far turn and rallied
inside for second. RONIN WARRIOR stalked early on, vied three wide on the backside, dueled, chased on the far turn and held third. FIRE'S FINALE
stalked close up four wide, chased three wide on the far turn and weakened. SEAT OF HONOR raced three wide off the pace and failed to threaten. WILD
UNION set the pace in the two path, vied between rivals, dueled and gave way.

the turn, moved out in the stretch and rallied too late. BLUNT FORCE steadied inside rival nearing the far turn, recovered and closed well. GIA'S FUEGO
prompted the pace wide to the final turn and faltered. SIZZLING ROMA dropped back early and lacked a rally. KNOCK OUT KID settled behind rivals and
faded to last on the turn. TWIRLING WIND raced within striking range then weakened steadily. Following a stewards inquiry and ab objection by fourth

CAJUN COUSIN raced off the leaders, bid three wide on the turn, collared the pacesetter and drew off under steady handling in the final eighth. VALUABLE
BREIGH forced the pace three wide, led between calls in the stretch but was no match for the winner. VITAEMI rushed to the front inside, led in hand, was
collared and faltered. FRAME THIS lacked speed, moved wide in the stretch with late energy. EXCITABLE LADY lacked speed along the inside, angled out
in the stretch with a mild bid. THE BIGGEST ONE flashed speed between rivals and stopped on the turn. J J LOVES BILLY dropped back at the start and
raced far behind throughout.

the sixteenth marker and outfinished for the top spot. HIDDEN PROMISE vied two wide for the lead, dueled on the backside, chased on the far turn, dug in
between rivals, steadied behind a rival at the sixteenth marker and then gained late for third. ORIGO vied inside for the lead, dueled on the backside, shook
free on the far turn, dug in through the lane, drifted out a bit near the sixteenth marker and weakened late. ROYAL COUP was off a bit slow, raced off the
pace, off the rail, saved ground on the far turn and failed to threaten. HENRYTHETHIRD steadied after the start, raced off the pace, two wide on the
backside and did not factor. HE RUNS THE LINE raced two wide off the pace, then three wide and gave way. After a Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey
