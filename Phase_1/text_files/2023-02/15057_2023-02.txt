Footnotes
MOSQUITO FLEET was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and edged away late.
JUNE GLOOM was away in good order to duel for the lead with EL MASETRO, disposed of that rival after going three furlongs, opened a clear margin with
a quarter to run and gave way grudgingly to the winner in the drive. SLEWS HYMN was never far back while racing along the inside, moved up to offer a bid
nearing the quarter and failed to gain late. MIRROR IMAGE pressed the pace while racing five-wide and gave way after going three furlongs. YOU SPLIT
TENS showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, steadied nearing the half-mile pole and did not offer a bid. EL MAESTRO disputed the
pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going three-eighths.

MANDONA was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths marker, vied with BETTY'S BAR and proved
best through a prolonged drive. BETTY'S BAR chased the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to engage in tandem with the winner, vied with that
foe through a vigorous drive and just missed. RATTLEME sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, angled out into the stretch, stayed on
well in the drive and finished willingly. TRULY A MESS settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and was
not a factor. PANCAKES AND BEER lagged throughout.

GIVE EM HECK BECK was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second-turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew
off. TEMPTED MISSION set a pressured pace from the inside and yielded to the winner after going three-quarters. LITTLE RED RIFLE showed no early
speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished with a late bid. GODGUNSNCOUNTRY drifted out nearing the seven-eighths marker, chased
the leaders while racing four-wide, offered a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole and gave way in the drive. FAST GALLITO broke sharply then raced off the
leaders early, weakened after going a half and was eased late.

through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run, reached the winner nearing the sixteenth pole, vied and just missed. AMY D was reserved just off the
leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. IDA NEEDA DRINK showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the
turn and finished with some late run. ICE N LEMON lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SPITTEN KITTEN disputed the

Footnotes
ROWANGOESHOLLYWOOD was off a step slow then hustled along to open a clear lead before going a quarter, raced four-wide while setting the pace,
remained in control through mid-stretch and held sway to the wire. SEVEN SISTERS chased the leaders while racing four-wide, angled in with a furlong to
run and was up for the place. FULL OF GRACE chased the leaders while racing three-wide and failed to gain in the drive. BIG CYN settled off the leaders
early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished evenly. ATLANTIC PRINCESS raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and
lacked the needed rally. JACANA lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SUE ETTAS GHOST was void of early speed,
raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. BEAU ROCKS showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten.
