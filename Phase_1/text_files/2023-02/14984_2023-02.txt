Footnotes
ZERTZ bobbled at the start then bumped lightly with a foe, was hard ridden off the pace, chased in the four to five path around the turn, gained under a
drive into upper stretch, made a bid and reached even terms for the lead into the final furlong, fought gamely outside of the runner-up to the wire and
narrowly prevailed. POPPY'S PRIDE showed speed on the outside then moved clear before the half-mile pole, went around the turn in the two path, was
asked coming to the quarter-pole, responded well when challenged by the winner near the eighth-pole, fought on well with that foe in the final furlong and
just missed while able to get the place. WINNING DRIVE was urged along on the outside, went five wide early on the turn then was guided to the three path,
remained in the three path through the rest of the bend, gained under a drive into upper stretch, chased the top two to the wire and was out-kicked while
clear for the show. ICY STORM was urged along at the rear, went around the turn in the two path, was driven five wide into upper stretch and improved
position then was reported to have bled. R BOY BODE made light contact with an opponent at the start then was hustled, showed speed on the inside of a
foe, dropped back while taken in hand near the half-mile pole then shifted out leaving the backstretch, chased in the three to four path around the turn and
capitulated. STANDUP was sent hard from the start then urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and was no factor.

OUTLAW COUNTRY was urged along on the outside, moved in leaving the backstretch, went three wide early on the turn then shifted five wide while
gaining with three furlongs to run, swept to the front coming to the quarter-pole, dropped to the three path into upper stretch, disposed of the runner-up at
the sixteenth-pole and proved best under good handling. ROL AGAIN DANCER moved up with five furlongs, pressed the pace between horses, bumped
lightly with a foe near the nine-sixteenths, took a short lead in the two path inside the seven-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner approaching the
quarter-pole, fought inside of that foe into the final furlong and was outfinished while well clear for the place. MSHINDI was bumped hard on both sides at
the start then stumbled, spotted the front several lengths, was urged at the rear, angled from the two path to the four path early on the turn, moved to the
five path later on that bend, came six wide into upper stretch and earned the show. FIRE KING broke in and bumped hard with a foe, moved out then was
urged along off the pace, chased four wide around the turn and tired. BASIC TRUTH stalked the pace on the outside, made light contact with a foe near the
nine-sixteenths, chased in the three path around the turn and capitulated. LARZ bumped hard with a rival at the start, went to the front, showed the way
down the backstretch, lost the lead while under urging along the rail early on the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
RADIO RED coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside, was in behind ON THE LEDGE midway on the turn and attempted to tip out to the two path
nudging POP COVER out but was denied the move as that rival held his rightful lane, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and angled four wide for
home, rallied to take command a furlong out, then edged clear to prevail. ON THE LEDGE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front and took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and kept on knocking heads
with POP COVER to the finish besting that rival for the place honors. POP COYER chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
had ON THE LEDGE lean out attempting to nudge him out of his lane three furlongs from home but denied the move holding steady to his rightful path,
advanced to take command and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got collared near the eighth pole and kept on head to head to the finish with the
aforementioned foe but was ultimately bested for the place honors. LIFETIME OF CHANCE broke out at the start, chased two to three wide until tucked
inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. ART
OF COURAGE coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and tired.
MIRACLE MIKE strode greenly and sluggish early on quickly growing detached at the tail of the field three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along with
seven-sixteenths to go, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. DISARMED chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, tired.

of being shaken off, spun three wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
STONE CREATOR came away in good order then was hustled, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, responded well when set down in upper
stretch and drew off under a strong hand-ride. SHADOLAMO tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased in the three path around the turn, came under
the crop approaching the five-sixteenths and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. TEMPERMENTAL was urged along off the pace,
saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and weakened while best of the rest. CARBON broke a bit awkwardly then brushed with a
foe, raced just off the pace, was urged along late on the backstretch, dropped back in the four path around the turn and capitulated. JULIANA'S ROSE was
forwardly placed on the outside, chased in the five path around the turn and tired. KEEN DANCER brushed with an opponent at the start, moved out while
dropping back early, angled in at the rear leaving the backstretch, traveled around the turn in the two path, swung five wide into upper stretch and was no
factor.

Footnotes
EMPIRE RIDE chased four wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, continued four wide for home, rallied to take command a sixteenth out, edged clear
to the finish kept to task. OCTOBER BLISS chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued three wide for home, rallied to take
command a furlong out, dug in and was collared near the sixteenth pole, ran on to secure the place honors. WHO ME showed the way early on in hand in
the two path, knocked heads with AMMAN down the backstretch nearing the turn, came under pressure from an additional pair and got placed to coaxing at
the seven-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. IN MY SHADOW coaxed from the gate, chased just
off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and improved position.
AMMAN coaxed from the start, raced forwardly placed tucking inside early before dueling with WHO ME to his outside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. BOYS CODE coaxed from the gate, chased four to five wide under
coaxing from the half mile pole, went seven wide into upper stretch, tired.
