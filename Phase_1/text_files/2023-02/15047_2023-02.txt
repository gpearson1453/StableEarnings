up for second. CURLIN'S THRILL trailed the field, moved up nearing the far turn, advanced between rivals on the turn, rallied into second, then was
outfinished late for the place spot. DRONE SWARM raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the backside, chased inside on the far turn and had no
rally. IN EQUALITY raced off the rail, off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, rode the rail into the stretch and lacked a rally. E T'S SUPER STAR stalked

NOTHINS FREE quickly sped to the front, widened in hand on the turn, then remained well clear while kept to her task. PENANCE lacked speed, angled out
in the stretch and closed well for the place. CABRA CHICA chased off the pace, advanced wide on the turn then flattened out. SMOOTH AS GLASS
prompted the winner outside then weakened through the stretch. B B'S ROCKET saved ground close up then began faltering on the turn. KENAI COOL was
taken up just after the start, raced inside and finished willingly. ANGINETTI dropped back in the two path and faded steadily.

Footnotes
CAJUN LOVER quickly took control in hand, widened on the turn and kept a long advantage while under steady urging. PASSAGE OF LINES lacked speed,
moved very wide in the stretch and closed strongly. HARD WEST raced close up between rivals in the opening quarter and continued willingly. MANOLETE
dropped back inside, offered a brief bid then flattened out. CUNEO stumbled at the start, rushed to contention then faded. HIDE THE RANSOM dropped far
behind then passed rivals without menacing. GRAVEL ROAD chased in midpack, moved closer on the turn then weakened. MANAHAWKIN trailed far
behind then caught fading opponents. SATCHEL DE RITCHES raced wide just off the pacesetter and faded on the turn. CATCH MY VIBE hustled within
range off the pace and faltered. SPITTIN IMAGE raced wide and weakened steadily. LOVERBOY LOU stopped abruptly on the turn and was eased through
the stretch and walked off afterward.

Footnotes
DREAMING OF GERRY tracked close up on the inside, saved ground on the far turn, made a rail run entering the stretch, quickly took over, drew off,
widened and was ridden out. GOOD CULTURE stalked close up outside, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled into the stretch, dug in gamely but second
best. KODAPENDENT was off a bit slow, outrun early, moved up at the quarter pole and closed belatedly. ABUELO NUNO raced off the rail, off the pace,
was asked on the far turn, angled four wide turning for home, then lacked a rally. WILL E SUTTON raced off the pace inside and did not factor. LIAM'S
BLUE MOON set the pace racing with a clear lead, dueled past the quarter pole and gave way in the final furlong.
