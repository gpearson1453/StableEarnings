TREASURE OF WAR unhurried to far turn, wide run into the stretch and improved slightly only. KIMBERLEY DREAM well off rail trip while never a factor
and dropped back. KING'S LEGACY no speed while inside into stretch, stopped. COMMANDERS PALACE tracked leaders from inside to far turn, six wide
into stretch while stopping readily. GEORGETOWN ROAD never prominent throughout.
