Footnotes
LINN PIER saved ground off the early, was firmly in hand while keen late on the first turn and down the backstretch, continued to gain inside around the far
turn, swung four wide in upper stretch, closed outside and was up in deep stretch. CAPPY stalked the pace from the rail, angled three wide near the quarter
pole, took the lead past the eighth pole, drifted out under left-handed urging and was unable to stave off the winner late. RITA MARGA set the pace two
wide between foes around the first turn, cleared early on the backstretch, set a pressured pace inside around the far turn, led past the eighth pole and
settled for the show. MARTINI'S AMICA hit the starting gate, raced off the pace two wide, briefly angled out in upper stretch, angled to the rail soon after
and finished with interest. OUTFORARUN pressed the pace three wide between foes around the first turn and two wide around the far turn then tired in the
drive. TRUE MARTINI chased the pace four wide and faded nearing the quarter pole. POMONA'S BULLET broke awkwardly, saved ground and never
threatened. FROSTY SECRET chased the pace two wide and faded three wide around the far turn. MURDER HORNET steadied early, raced three wide
and made little impact. AVE FENIX played no factor while racing four wide.

Footnotes
ZOSTEROP hit the outer side of the gate at the start, was held up between foes in the three path, shifted to the rail into the far turn and was cued passing
the quarter pole, angled out to the four path into the lane, ran on to take the lead from an inner rival going into the final furlong and drew clear. BATTLING
BUBBLES got bumped by an inner foe twice leaving the gate and was off the pace in the six path into the backstretch, advanced while tipping into the three
path into the far turn and was roused to bid nearing the three-eighths, took a narrow lead in the two path entering the lane, but was overtaken by an outer
foe going into the final furlong to finish with place. DIXIE GROOVE trailed in the four path early, was driven in the four path around the far turn and urged
right handed in the five path entering the stretch, and kept on to secure show. TWO BEER BUZZ raced prominently in the four path, was cued to bid in the
two path around the far turn and took a brief lead passing the quarter pole, but was overtaken by an outer foe while shifting inside at the top of the stretch,
and faded. MAGIC CALL rated along the rail, tipped out to the three path turning into the lane, but was no factor. APPLE SAUCY broke out and bumped
twice with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the five path, was urged in the three path around the far turn, but was no threat from the five path in the
stretch. SUBTLE FAITH set the pace in the two path, was coaxed in the nearing the quarter pole but gaveway into the lane.

Footnotes
TICKING set the pace in the four path, shifted inside into the turn and was roused when challenged by an outer foe passing the three eighths pole, kicked
away from that foe passing the quarter pole and was cued right handed to open up in the three path in the stretch, drew clear and was wrapped up late.
POWER HUMOR was prompted in the five path, roused to bid to the outside of the pacesetter in the three path passing the three-eighths pole, but lost
touch with that foe turning into the lane, and ran on in the five path in the stretch to secure place. ADIOS PAPA CHICO was a bit keen and steadied near the
five-eighths pole, rated along the inside, tipped out to the four path entering the stretch, and kept on for show. DREAM ON BABY brushed with an outer foe
at the start, stalked in the two path, had to steady into the turn, was ridden around the turn and in the two path at the top of the stretch, and evened out
passing the eighth pole. NATURAL VIBES brushed with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the five path into the turn, was out in the seven path entering the
stretch and was no factor. NORFIE was hustled along off the pace in the seven path, shifted in around the turn and was in the five path entering the stretch,
but never threatened. BERNARDO'S LEGACY was steadied passing the five-eighths pole and was wellback in the four path, swung out to the eight path
turning into the stretch, but was never involved. DREAM KNIGHT bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the six path but was no menace. ST JOE
HARBOR pressed in the two path but gaveway around the turn. TOP MAVERICK bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced up close in the three path but
gaveway going into the stretch.

Footnotes
UBIQUITOUS stalked the pace inside, waited for room in the two path late on the turn, angled in in upper stretch, took over inside near the eighth pole,
drifted out under stout left-handed urging and dug in gamely to repel a late challenge. PICO D'ORO stalked the pace three wide, steadily gained through the
lane but was turned back late. GOLDEN SODA dueled two wide to midstretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. TOWN OF GOLD chased the pace four
wide and lacked the needed rally. SARAWAT hopped at the start, raced off the pace outside, swung widest in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. TRINNI
SUMMER played no factor while racing three wide. SCOTTY BROWN saved ground and failed to menace. ROYAL MAHOGANY dueled inside and
retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
BALLETIC raced prominently in the three path, was in the four path rounding the turn and bid passing the quarter pole, took the lead in the five path and
was cued at the top of the lane, and drew clear while tipping in the three path passing the eighth pole. UP FOR IT brushed with an inner foe at the start,
trailed in the three path, shifted to the rail around the turn, angled out to the six path into the stretch, and rallied for place. MILLIE JEAN set the pace inside,
was roused in the two path entering the lane, yielded to the winner passing the eighth pole, but held on to show. WORK OF FICTION chased in the three
path, was ridden around the turn and in the five path going into the stretch, and evened out passing the eighth pole. DANDELION stalked along the inside,
steadied passing the three-eighths pole, was coaxed from the four path into the stretch, but flattened in the final furlong. RANSOM STYLE raced off the
pace in the four path, dropped back to last while in the three path around the turn, and was no factor. LEXI'S SPIRIT brushed with an outer foe at the start,
rated in the five path, was roused around the turn, but no menace from the eight path in the stretch.

Footnotes
BABY BILLY got bumped between foes at the start, raced in midpack in the two path, was roused into the far turn and moved up along the rail, bid turning
into the stretch and took the lead in the three path at the top of the lane, led going into the final furlong and held on while drifting out late. MONDEGO (GB)
set the pace inside, lost the lead while floating out to the five path entering the lane, and dug in to hold place. BEL AMI bumped with an inner foe and had to
steady just after, raced off the pace in the four path, was roused around the far turn and angled out to the ten path entering the lane, and rallied down the
center for show. KING D'ORO rated in the three path around the first turn and in the five path down the backstretch, swung out to the nine path into the
stretch, and kept on. CURLINS INCHARGE raced prominently in the four path around the first turn and was in the five path down the backstretch, lost
ground and was ridden into the far turn, floated out to the seven path into the lane, and was one paced. FAYETTE SPIRIT tracked in the four path but
evened out from the two path in the stretch. COAST ALONG brushed with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the two path around the first turn and was in
the four path down the backstretch, brushed with an outer foe turning into the lane, and flattened from the two path in the stretch. MUFRIH raced wellback in
the four path and was no factor from the seven path in the stretch. COMPOSER'S DREAM brushed with an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace in the
three path, brushed with an inner foe turning into the the lane and floated out in upper stretch, and was no threat. FOR THE CHIEF broke out and bumped
an outer foe, and trailed throughout around the five path.

Footnotes
CARROTHERS raced off the pace between foes early, steadied and angled four wide midway around the first turn, advanced four wide around the far turn,
continued on the left lead in the lane, took the lead near the sixteenth pole, dueled outside from there and narrowly prevailed. ALLEY OOP JOHNNY had
speed five wide around the first turn, took the lead early on the backstretch, set the pace in the two path around the far turn, led to the sixteenth pole, dug
gamely inside of the winner and just missed. CASHIER CHECK raced in range two and three wide, lacked a rally but was well clear of the rest. WHAT SAY
THEE had early speed three wide between foes around the first turn, chased inside down the backstretch and around the far turn and weakened in the lane.
INDY LYON was wrangled back inside early, went four wide around the far turn and never threatened. LAKER MAMBA led four wide between foes around
the first turn, could not keep pace down the backstretch and faded inside around the far turn. PALACE KITTEN steadied early, raced two wide and made
little impact. VENEZUELAN TRIUMPH chased the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
FAMOUS GENT trailed in the three path into the turn, was roused into the lane and angled out to the center entering the final furlong, and rallied to surge
past a trio of inner foes late to win. NIC'S BRO stalked in the four path, was ridden around the turn and tipped out to the six path into the stretch, and ran on
for place. FEELTHEBEAT rated in the two path, was roused around the turn and moved up between rivals passing the quarter pole, swung out to the seven
path into the lane, and kept on for show. ADIOS GARY was held up while up close and shifted to the rail into the turn, waited for room along the inside
passing the quarter pole, was cued thru an inside opening at the top of the lane, and stayed on to lead just past the eighth pole, but was caught by a late
charging trio of outer foes to miss minor rewards. BELLA FUTURE raced prominently in the four path into the turn, bid in the three path around the turn and
was cued in the five path at the top of the lane, but evened out passing the eighth pole. EXCHANGE DAY raced off the pace inside, was roused around the
turn and tipped out to the five path into the lane, but had to steady and was shut off passing the eighth pole, and was unable to factor. LOVIN MAKES
CENTS set the pace along the inside but yielded in the two path just past the eighth pole. BRIT'S CANDYMAN prompted the pace between rivals in the two
path but gaveway in the three path passing the eighth pole. SUNSET PROVISION was prompted along in midpack from the five path but was empty going
into the stretch.

JUST A CARE (IRE) chased in the four path, ranged up in the five path around the turn and was cued right handed in the six path at the top of the lane, and
rallied to draw past an inner foe in the final sixteenth. CALABRIAN QUEEN set the pace while shifting inside into the turn, was roused in the two path
passing the quarter pole and cued right handed at the top of the lane, ran on but was caught by an outer foe in the final sixteenth to place. GOLDEN STAR
raced prominently along the inside, was roused to bid between rivals from the four path around the turn and urged right handed into the lane, and kept on to
hold show. ASTRILA had to steady early, rated in the two path, advanced around the turn was driven into the stretch, but evened out passing the eighth
pole. MISS UPROAR tracked in the three path, had to steady slightly early around the turn to avoid a fading foe, floated out to the seven path into the
stretch, but was no factor. CORA'S CHOICE raced wellback along the inside, was urged into the lane, and flattened passing the eighth pole. OLYMPIC
ARTIST bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the four path and never threatened while going wide into the stretch. ALGARCA bumped
with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the three path into the turn and was never a menace. FAMOSA prompted the pace in the three path, began to fade
early around the turn, took an awkward step and was precautionarily pulled up nearing the quarter pole, and walked off.
