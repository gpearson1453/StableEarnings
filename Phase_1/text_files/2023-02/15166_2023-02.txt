Footnotes
AZTEC LEGEND bumped mildly with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while
saving ground around the turn and kicked clear in the lane. CRUISING DEREK veered out and bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, chased the
leaders up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two and three path and kept on to the finish. AWESOME PRINCE trailed the field on the outside
early, began to move up racing in the four and five path around the bend and continued to improve position in the stretch. RUSTY PISTOL pressed the pace
on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn, weakened in the lane and was later vanned off. SMART DRESSER bumped
with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and showed no kick.
FAST FIXER bumped with the horses to both sides at the break, raced in the middle of the pack between horses for the opening quarter of a mile, saved
ground around the turn and faded in the lane. ATLANTIC VAQUERO hit the gate leaving it, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated
the bend from the four path and was empty in the stretch. THE RIDER OF HORSE TWO, CRUISING DEREK, FILED AN OBJECTION AGAINST HORSE
ONE, AZTEC LEGEND, CITING INTERFERENCE AT THE START. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
EXPRESS PHAROAH raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn, gained ground outside
and pulled clear. ROOKIE SALSA dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and in upper stretch, was
caught in the final furlong and chased the winner home from there. OLD TIME REVIVAL dueled on the inside through the opening half mile, continued to
battle in upper stretch and gave way late. LAUDERDALE bumped lightly with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled off the pace for the run up the
backstretch, saved ground around the bend and made no bid. EL SOLITARIO bumped with the horse to his outside at the break, trailed the field through the
early going, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor. CHILL HAZE chased the leaders up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in
the two path around the turn and tired further in the lane. PER THE FLORIDA RACING COMMISSION, EXPRESS PHAROAH HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED
DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
LIGEIA raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from
the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole, gained ground outside in upper stretch and pulled clear. IRISH KITTEN raced in the three path around
the first turn, stalked the pace setters on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the second bend, dueled in the lane
and chased the winner home late. NEWYEARSPRESENT tracked the leader on the outside through the opening half mile, began a bid from the two path
coming around the turn, dueled in upper stretch, was caught by the winner in the final furlong and kept on to the finish. SHE IS ROYALTY raced in the four
path early, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the four path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and
improved position in the lane. SYLLABUS raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two path
and improved position in the stretch. I'LL GO ALL IN saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, was forced to
steady near the three eighths pole when BYZANTINE EMPIRE backed up into him, switched out the three path and flattened out in the lane.
LIFENHOWULIVIT raced in the two path early, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack on the outside, angled in to save ground around the
second bend and never threatened. BYZANTINE EMPIRE led the field while saving ground around the first turn, continued to show the way while racing up
the backstretch, began to drop back from the rail coming around the far turn and tired further in the stretch. BLACK KARMA raced in the middle of the pack
on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far bend from the two path and faded in the lane. GET IT trailed the field the entire
way around the oval, saved ground throughout and was never a factor. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE FAR TURN. UPON REVIEW, NO
CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

SHIMMERING LIGHT raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the
second turn and in upper stretch and held off a closer at the wire. MAPACHE G raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace for the run up
the backstretch, began to move up from the four path coming around the second bend and continued to gain ground late. WATCH FOR THE LUTE hit the
gate leaving it, recovered to lead the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the far bend and dug
in the lane, giving way late. PAPA JIMMY shied away from an alligator but was held firmly in place in the three and four path by his rider headed around the
first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and finished evenly. MACHO REAL bobbled slightly
leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, trailed well behind the field up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the two path and improved
position mildly while never threatening. ACTION WARRIOR tracked the pace setters on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, dropped
back while saving ground around the far turn and faded further in the lane. NIP OF BOURBON saved ground around the first turn, raced into traffic and
steadied slightly entering the backstretch, continued in the middle of the pack from there, raced in the two path around the second turn and was empty in the
stretch. THE TRAINER OF HORSE TWO, NIP OF BOURBON, FILED AN OBJECTION AGAINST HORSE FOUR, SHIMMERING LIGHT, CITING
INTERFERENCE COMING OFF THE FIRST TURN. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH. AN ALLIGATOR WAS
ON THE TRACK AT THE START OF THE BACKSTRETCH AND MAY HAVE CAUSED OFF CAMERA INTERFERENCE WITH SOME OF THE HORSES

VAMOS VIEJO chased the leaders up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, launched a bid nearing the quarter pole and kicked clear in
the lane. EXTREME ACCESS bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack for the early going, saved ground
around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and gained ground late. WOW WISH raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter
of a mile, came around the turn in the two path, drifted in and steadied slightly in tight quarters near the eighth pole and improved position from there. DEE'S
WISEGUY dueled on the outside up the backstretch, led the field from the two path around the turn and in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong.
DEPOLI was reluctant to load, trailed the field up the backstretch, improved position from the three path coming around the bend and was outkicked in the
lane. CITY HUMOR veered in and brushed with the horse to his inside at the start, recovered to duel on the rail up the backstretch, chased the leader from
the two path around the turn and faded in the stretch. INSTIGATING raced off the pace between horses early, saved ground around the bend and made no
bid. MYSPECIALVALENTINE hopped up and was blocked at the break, raced off the pace between horses up the backstretch, continued around the turn in
the two path and was empty in the stretch. THE RIDER OF HORSE SEVEN, WOW WISH, FILED AN OBJECTION AGAINST HORSE THREE, EXTREME
ACCESS, CITING INTERFERENCE NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

the four path, began a bid passing the quarter pole, kicked clear with a furlong to go, drifted out and bumped with HARD ATTACK near the wire and held off
that rival at the finish. HARD ATTACK was away from the gate slowly, saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch,
came around the second bend in the five path, began a bid entering the stretch and gained ground steadily late despite bumping with ROYAL LUCK near
the wire. ULTIMATE IRONY raced off the pace on the inside through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the two path and gained ground
late. MR. SARCASTIC saved ground at the back of the pack through the opening half mile, moved up while racing in the three path around the far turn and
continued to gain ground in the stretch. D'CRAZINESS raced in the three path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the
backstretch, navigated the second bend from the four path and passed tiring horses in the lane. BORGOBYTHESEA led the field while saving ground
around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the far turn and faded in the stretch. FLY FLY AWAY raced in the three path
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, came around the far bend still in the three path and showed no
kick. LUCA DREW THE ACE raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming
around the second bend and tired in the lane. LAND MARK DEAL saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the
run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and flattened out in the stretch. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE
