Footnotes
B T'S BAD BOY showed good early speed to set the early pace and held gamely to be clear under strong handling. JUDGE'S BRIBE was off slowly, moved
up strongly three deep around the far turn and finished gamely to the wire. CHIEF TY HE pressed the pace from the inside and finished willingly to the wire.
PRINCE B stalked the pace, raced two to three wide and raced evenly with no closing run. P R WHY NOT was off a step slow, raced three to four wide into
the upper stretch and had no late rally. DIAMANTE JOSE dropped back early and failed to respond. HUSKER LEGACY saved ground and never
threatened.
