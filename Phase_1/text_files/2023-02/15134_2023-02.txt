margin and held AND I KNOW safe late. AND I KNOW was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and was gaining on the

DEPUTY'S DANCER was away in good order to press the pace of PHILLIPIE FAST while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, quickly opened a widening lead and was ridden out to the wire. SYZSLAK settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the
second turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but was clearly second best. PHILIPIE FAST broke sharply then was hustled along to set a pressured
pace from the inside and weakened after going a half. ABRIERWIN showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten.

AWESOME BID was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside with EZ GUESS, disposed of that rival after going three furlongs, opened a clear
margin with a quarter to run and held BUMPY CUP safe late. BUMPY CUP was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and
gaining late. FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR chased the leaders while racing five-wide, stayed on well in the drive and finished willingly. SQUARE ROOT
settled off the leaders from the inside, reached a contending position but failed to gain late. SAYERS lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and
was not a factor. OUR EMPIRE showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. STYLISH ELEGANCE was void of
early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace. EZ GUESS broke sharply to dispute the pace while racing three-wide and weakened
after going three furlongs.

Footnotes
DIPLOMATICA sprinted clear at once, was well rated through the back-stretch, increased her margin into the lane and was ridden out to be kept to task.
FAST TO FORTUNE was away in good order to chase the winner while racing three-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best.
VALUE DANCER was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and failed to gain in the drive. SHAMAN'S PRODIGY showed no
early speed, saved ground through the second turn and finished with a belated bid. EARLYNTHEMORN was void of early foot, saved ground through the
second turn and did not threaten. MISS GHISLAINE lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not menace. NO PEOPLE
hopped at the start, lagged early, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
