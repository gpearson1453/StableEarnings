Footnotes
ZEEBEAR broke in then was hustled to the lead, set the pace under pressure to his outside, was urged along while inside on the turn, shook clear into
upper stretch, switched to the proper lead inside the three-sixteenths and drew off under steady urging. MAKART was urged along off the pace, went three
to four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, remained on his inside lead to the wire and earned the place while no match for the winner.
TREVOR BARDETTE broke out then was hustled, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path around the turn, dropped to the three path
coming to the quarter-pole, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and weakened then lost the place while well clear for the show.
BOINTHEBACK was fractious in the gate then bobbled ever so slightly at the start, fell well behind while angling towards the inside, saved ground around
the turn, spun three wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to threaten. STEERAGE was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the
outside of the winner, vied in the three then two path around the turn, dropped back nearing the quarter-pole and tired. NOAH'S DESTINY was coaxed
along off the pace, saved ground around the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
HYPNOCURRENCY three wide in close aim of a duel through moderate splits in a compact field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths as the pace
quickened, swung four wide for home, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking narrow command seventy yards from home, dug in and
prevailed at the end. BERNT AGAIN dueled in hand from the two path through sensible splits early on, began to quicken three furlongs out, got set down
continuing in the two path into upper stretch, dug in under a drive coming under threat through the final furlong and was caught in the final seventy yards to
the finish. KARA PARA just off the inside tracking the front in close aim, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch
and kept on to the finish to secure the show honors. DASHING DELLA broke a beat slow, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. TWO REDHEADS dueled in hand along the inside of BERNT AGAIN among a field in close quarters
where nearly only two lengths separated last from first midway down the backstretch, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and was unable to
quicken with her pace rival midway on the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch backing away and weakened to the finish. CAUSE I'M ELEGANT
perched four wide in aim of the front down the backstretch and into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and faded, continued four wide at the
quarter pole and tired.

Footnotes
FUNNY HOW tossed her head just before the start and broke a bit slow then was taken up while pinched back in tight between horses, was rated at the rear
while given cover behind rivals, traveled two to three wide while full of energy on the turn, came under encouragement around the five-sixteenths, rallied
outside to make a five wide bid into upper stretch then took the advantage, shook clear into the final furlong and drew off under a moderate-hand ride to win
ridden out. BETSY BLUE bumped with a rival at the start, was coaxed along while off the pace, dropped to the rear near the nine-sixteenths, started the turn
in the two path then shifted four wide, came five wide into the stretch then shifted seven wide before the three-sixteenths, remained on her inside lead until
inside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and improved to just get the place. BANK STING was loaded riderless and restless in the gate,
brushed with an opponent at the start, lost her best action while briefly off heels near the three-quarter pole then dropped back, settled near the rear, saved
ground early on the turn, moved to the two path then three path under urging later on that bend, shifted out while getting closer around the furlong marker
and just missed the place while clear for the show. KNOW IT ALL AUDREY brushed with a rival at the start then bumped with another foe, attended the
pace on the outside down the backstretch, vied in the three path around the turn, was given her cue outside the quarter-pole, reached even terms for the
lead under a drive at the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. HONEY MONEY tracked the pace on the outside, chased four
then five wide around the turn, spun six wide into upper stretch and tired. NOVEMBER REIN broke out but in front then was hustled, showed the way down
the backstretch, was asked while inside to the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and gave way.

Footnotes
PAPI ON ICE bumped at the start by GOLDEN PURCHASE, who broke outwards, raced two to three wide through the first turn and then three to four wide
down the backstretch, went five wide through the far turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued five wide for home, dug in under a drive
steadily gaining and was brushed by NORTH POLE nearing the sixteenth marker, came inwards under right rein direction and bumped that foe twice forcing
a slight steady seventy yards out while taking command late to get up and prevail. PROVEN HOPE four then three wide into the first turn, crossed to the rail
to show the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, drifted to the rail momentarily
straightened away, dug in leg weary through the final furlong and was caught in the late stages. NORTH POLE tossed his head at the start and was away
last, raced four wide through the first turn before chasing three then two wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, dug in
under a drive coming out slightly despite a left handed crop near the sixteenth marker and brushed PAPI ON ICE, then had that rival come inwards under
right handed reins and was bumped twice in the final seventy yards and forced to briefly steady between foes missing for the place honors on the wire.
GOLDEN PURCHASE broke out at the start bumping PAPI ON ICE, chased along the inside through the first turn and down the backstretch, tipped to the
two path through the far turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. LEFTY'S WAR three wide through
the opening bend, chased two then three wide under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide at the head of the stretch and tired. RED JET
coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths well behind, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and was
eased home to the finish. TIGER TOWN BOY coaxed from the start, chased along the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into
upper stretch eased up, and walked home through the final sixteenth to the finish.

Footnotes
BELLS ON HER TOES was urged along while well off the pace, moved out around the five-eighths, dropped in late on the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn, swung four wide into the stretch then moved further out, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed with a rush to get up late. LONDON
GOLD was hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, gained to take a narrow advantage in upper
stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while just able to get the place. SWEET AS SUGAR broke in then brushed with a foe
while quickly corrected, showed the way under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage in upper stretch, fought on well into
the final furlong, drifted out outside the sixteenth-pole, kept on to the wire and just missed the place while clear for the show. MORE MANGO brushed with a
rival at the start and was off a step slow, dropped well back under urging, went two then three wide around the turn, came five wide into the stretch then
moved further out and finished with good energy but was belatedly on the scene while up for the last spot in the superfecta. QPIDSCARIZMATKQTEE was
hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the two path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths on even terms for the
lead, switched to the proper lead while battling with two foes inside the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened.

Footnotes
RAGTIME BLUES angled in while showing good speed, contested the pace several paths to the inside of a foe, vied inside on the turn, responded well
when set down into upper stretch, was given one pop of a right-handed crop coming to the furlong marker, disposed of rivals while switched to a left-handed
crop outside the sixteenth-pole and drew away under strong urging. PRINTRACK broke out at the start, showed speed while taken under restraint,
contested the pace on the far outside, vied in the three path around the turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match for the winner
while just able to get the place. STRIKING SPEED broke in and brushed the gate then bumped with a rival, established a good position just off the pace,
moved out leaving the backstretch, was asked in the four path on the turn, gained to make a bid into upper stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong
and also proved no match for the winner then just missed the place but narrowly earned the show. SENOR JOBIM broke awkwardly and was off slow, was
guided out early then advanced on the outside, came under urging in the five path on the turn, chased outside under a drive in the stretch and just missed
the trifecta. F F ROCKET settled off the pace, moved from the rail to the three path under urging on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, shifted out
around the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. CARIBBEAN (AUS) was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, settled off the pace, went two
then three wide under urging early on the turn, dropped to the rail around the five-sixteenths and failed to rally. CAERUS settled on the outside, was urged
three to four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
PAROS was well placed just off the pace while inside of a foe, came under urging in the two path on the turn, shifted four wide outside the quarter-pole,
rallied to the lead into upper stretch and drew away under steady urging. ARREBATO brushed with a rival at the start, pressed the pace on the inside, vied
along the rail on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and proved no match for the winner while clear for the place. BRASS MONKEY was coaxed along
on the outside, went four wide under urging on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was just up for the show. SUPER COACH FRED was last to
commence, moved up to set the pace on the outside, vied in the two path for most of the turn, dropped to the rail outside the quarter-pole, lost the
advantage to the winner into upper stretch and weakened then just missed the show. FINANCIAL STRENGTH broke out and bumped with a foe, settled off
the pace, was hard ridden while two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to respond. BELLA COSA raced just off the pace
on the outside, was given his cue in the three path on the turn, chased into the stretch and came up empty. CHESS SPECTACULAR brushed with a foe at
the start, showed speed then pressed the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and capitulated. BEAR'S CORRECT was
restless in the gate, settled near the rear, moved from three to five wide around the turn and was no factor. GOLDEN BIRD FOREST was bumped in the
hindquarters at the start, settled while tossing his head some, dropped back three then two wide around the turn and faltered then was eased but walked off.
