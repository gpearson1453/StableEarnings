end. MISSWISH chased the early pace while inside then rallied and moved out to be three wide in upper stretch, made a bid to mid stretch but came up
empty in the end. PEARL'S CODE chased the early pace while two wide into the turn, made a bid four wide in upper stretch but was no menace in late
stretch. VIEWING TRAIL chased the early pace while four wide into the turn, made a bid five wide in upper stretch but was no threat. CRIMSON LADY
dueled for the lead while inside into the turn, was hard used then gave way in the stretch. QUEEN OF BEERS was unhurried early while inside on the turn
then failed to menace. ATTA MOY GIRL was chasing the early pace while three wide into the turn then was shuffled back on the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
WITT AMERICA lead the way into the first turn and onto the backstretch, then was challenged for the lead by an outer rival throughout the far turn, dug in
gamely to shake clear of that rival in the upper stretch then held on grudgingly to prove best in the end. MOROLICIOUS stalked the pace while two wide on
the backstretch, was in a hard drive to duel throughout the far turn, then continued to menace gamely in the stretch but could not catch the leader. BULLS
IN THE BRONX stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch, then bid mildly from the three path throughout the far turn into the stretch but came
up evenly. ASTA LAVISTA HONEY chased the pace in the middle of the field from the inside, then came out four wide on the far turn to bid in the stretch to
close well in the end. PICKINGUPSTRANGERS tracked the pace while two wide, made a mild bid on the far turn but came up empty in the stretch. KING
ARTHUR RIDGE was unhurried early and no menace. TEXAS HOLDEM was rank heading into the backstretch, then settled along the inside to bid on the
far turn and was no threat. DADA BOOM RIDGE tracked the pace from the three path in the middle of the field then bid on the far turn and failed to rally in
the stretch.

Footnotes
TRANQUILITY was allowed to settle heading into the first turn, was saving ground on the backstretch into the far turn, then dug in gamely to surge along the
rail down the home stretch and was up just in time. MORO NALA chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch, then came out three wide to bid on
the far turn, lugged in while splitting rivals mid stretch, then continued to menace but was caught in the end. BRADEE CASH raced in the middle of the field
along the rail, was moving up on the backstretch to bid five wide on the far turn, then closed willingly down the lane. RUN WITT RUN broke out and bumped
rival at the start, was four wide entering the first turn, then moved up to set the pace from the two path down the backstretch, was in a steady drive
throughout the far turn to rally in the stretch then gave way in the end. MADAME RUE chased the pace from the two path on the backstretch, bid four wide
on the far turn then flattened out in the stretch. LA VALEDORA was well placed in the two path heading into the first turn, then stalked the pace on the
backstretch, was in a long drive entering the stretch, then was cut off by an outer rival, steadied and had no final bid. NOMOROTHAT tracked the pace in
the middle of the pack from the two path then faded throughout the far turn and never fired in the stretch. EXPECT LAVENDER was unhurried early then
trailed behind the field and was no factor. There was a STEWARDS INQUIRY in regards to the stretch drive. After review, there was no change made to the
order of finish.
