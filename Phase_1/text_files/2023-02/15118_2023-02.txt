Footnotes
TAP THE BANK broke sharply to set the early pace while racing three-wide, responded when challenged in mid-stretch by SUPER CREATIVE, disposed of
that foe and drew clear. SUPER CREATIVE was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn, moved up to offer a bid in
mid-stretch but yielded to the winner through the final furlong. ALEX'S DREAM settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and
finished evenly in the drive. BUSTER BURNS raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. DEPUTY KNIGHT
lagged early, moved three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. JOE DID IT pressed the pace while racing three-wide, weakened after going
a half and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
COASTAL WATERS lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the stretch, back inside with a furlong to run, reached the fore
nearing the sixteenth pole and quickly drew off. NEXT JOURNEY dueled for the lead while racing three-wide with GUEST CHECK and gave way to the
winner late. GUEST CHECK disputed the pace with NEXT JOURNEY while racing from the inside and gave way through the final sixteenth. MOOGIE SON
chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way after going three-quarters. TERRACOTTA SOLDIER lagged early, raced four-wide through the
second turn and was not a factor. WEARENOTBADPEOPLE showed brief speed, weakened and was eased through the lane.
