Footnotes
ALIZEE veered out leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the five path coming
around the turn and pulled clear in the stretch. PRETTY RACHEL pressed the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, dueled from the
four path around the bend and chased the winner home in the lane, managing to get the head bob for second place. DAILY BRIEFING trailed the field on
the inside up the backstretch, began to move up while racing in the three path around the turn, and continued to gain ground late, just missing second place.
IDEAL BREEZE led the way on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the three path around the turn, was caught in midstretch and kept on the finish,
narrowly missing second. PINO IN A PURSE raced off the pace between horses early, navigated the turn from the two path and was mildly outkicked in the
stretch. SASSY LIKE JULIA tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
RICHIESONAROLL raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn, dueled down the stretch
and edged clear late. BARAK tracked the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter, launched a bid from the two path coming around the bend,
dueled down the lane and gave way late, the best of the rest. HELLO SUCKER chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around
the turn, couldn't go with the top two in the stretch and chased those two home. ALTAIR hopped up leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the inside early,
saved ground around the turn and improved position mildly in the lane, no match for the top two. PURE OF HEART bumped lightly with the horses to both
sides leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack through the opening stages, came around the bend in the four path and never threatened. FOREVER
SAUCY raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and made no bid. DISCREET DEVIL led the way
up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and tired in the stretch. MASTER SERGEANT raced at the back of the pack on the outside in
the early going, dropped back to trail the field while saving ground around the turn and was not a factor.

the two and three path, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and got up for the win late. CESAR raced in the two path around the first bend, chased the
leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming around the far turn and dueled in the stretch, getting caught near the wire.
SUMMER ALL YEAR led the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the far bend and weakened
in the final furlong. ROCK CHALK raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two path and
was outkicked in the lane. COX CANYON trailed the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, dropped back further while racing

CHEM MAJOR bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, dueled on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn and continued to battle down
the stretch, edging clear late. THE SWEATY FOX hit the gate leaving it, recovered to duel on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving
ground around the turn and in upper stretch and gave way late, the best of the rest. GINGER SPARKLE tracked the leaders between horses through the
opening quarter of a mile, raced in the three path around the turn and finished evenly, no match for the top two. LUNA AMARILLA raced in the middle of the
pack on the outside early, navigated the turn from the four path and finished evenly while never threatening. TOOSWEETFORME veered in at the start,
straightened out and chased the frontrunners on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back while racing in the two path around the turn and tired from
there. BLACK KARMA trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the four path and made no bid. LIFENHOWULIVIT
bumped mildly with the horse to her outside at the break, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and was
empty in the lane. FREEDOM EXPRESS raced off the pace on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
INTER MIAMI raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three and four path coming around the turn and
kicked clear late. SCRUTINIZER raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the early going, navigated the bend from the two path, began a bid passing
the quarter pole and gained ground in the lane. DAVIDIC LINE raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, moved up from the four and five path
coming around the turn and gained ground late. SCHOCHOH hit the gate leaving it, recovered to lead the way on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from
the rail around the bend and faded in the final furlong. ISLE OF SKYE bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to duel between
horses through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and weakened in the stretch. HENRY'S WORLD pressed
the pace on the outside early, chased the leaders from the three path headed into the turn and tired from there. I'M MONEY bumped with the horse to his
outside at the start, tracked the pace setters between horses up the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the bend and tired further in the
lane.
