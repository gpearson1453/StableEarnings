Footnotes
ROYAL REALM was hustled from the gate then bumped lightly with a foe, went three wide around the opening bend, prompted the pace on the outside,
took the lead in the two path with three furlongs to run, spun three wide into the stretch under a drive then lost the advantage at the three-sixteenths, fought
on well inside of two opponents in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. MICROSCOPE made light contact with a foe just after the
start, went two to three wide on the first turn, settled in a good position down the backstretch, chased two then three wide around the far turn, made a bid in
the four path into the stretch then took a short lead at the three-sixteenths, battled between foes to the wire and was denied while just able to get the place.
JUMPSTER went four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, came under urging late on the backstretch, chased three then four wide on the
far turn, made a five wide bid into upper stretch, fought outside of two foes while remaining on his inside lead until inside the furlong marker then swapped to
the proper lead, continued to tussle with two rivals to the wire and just missed while extremely far clear for the show. GOLDINI was away awkwardly then
brushed with a foe, went to the front, showed the way on the inside, lost the lead under strong urging at the three-eighths and tired. AMERICAN LINCOLN
stumbled at the start, bumped with a rival after the break then was taken up while pinched back, rounded the first turn in the three path, moved out onto the
backstretch, settled on the outside, traveled three wide around the far turn and was no factor. SUPPLY CHAIN was off slow and spotted the front several
lengths, saved ground at the rear and faltered.

Footnotes
PRINCE OF PHAROAHS chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide for home, rallied to take command just outside
the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive to prevail. GENTLEMAN JOE broke in at the start brushing BOURBON BAY, chased four to five paths off the
inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn advancing to take command at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in and was caught just outside the eighth pole, kept on to secure the place honors. BLAKE B. chased four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch and weakened. WILD BANKER chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,
spun three wide for home, improved position to the finish. MUSICAL HEART prompted the pace three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. THERISASTORMBREWIN chased along the inside under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, faltered, and was eased home to the finish. BOURBON BAY brushed at the start by
GENTLEMAN JOE, who broke inwards, showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from MUSICAL HEART, got displaced from the front
with five-sixteenths to go, took the inside route into upper stretch, grew leg weary and lost action a furlong out and was guided to the outside, placed to a
protective hold and pulled up just inside the sixteenth marker and was subsequently vanned off.

Footnotes
EASY TO BLESS stumbled at the start and was off a bit slow, was rated at the rear while behind horses, went four then five wide around the turn, gained to
take the lead in upper stretch, inched away into the final furlong and drew clear under steady urging. PIECE OF MY HEART was hustled from the gate,
settled off the pace, was urged in the two path around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and earned the place while no match for the winner.
SECRET LOVE was well placed just off the pace on the inside, came through along the rail to take the lead at the three-eighths, lost the advantage to the
winner near the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened then was caught for the place while clear for the show. MOSIENKO
prompted the pace on the outside of the leader, was asked in the three path while between foes on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch
and tired. EXOTIC WEST stalked the pace on the outside, issued a challenge in the four path around the turn, dropped back between foes into upper
stretch and capitulated. SELF ISOLATION went to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, lost the advantage in the two path at the
three-eighths and gave way.

Footnotes
BAVARIAN CREME broke in at the start pinching and forcing SHE'S A NATURAL to steady in tandem with PRACTICAL JULIA who came outwards, chased
six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced and took over
command swinging five wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. BON ADIEU chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while offering up a mild bid to be along clear of the rest and second
best. LAOCHI showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from LIMANI, came under coaxing when headed for command at the three-eighths,
angled out four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened while along for the show honors. LIMANI prompted the pace from the outside three to four wide
until tucked to the two path into the turn, took over command when placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front spinning three wide for home
and weakened. SHE'S A NATURAL got pinched at the start and was forced to steady soon after, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. LEM ME DRINK chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the
inside through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and tired. PRACTICAL JULIA broke out at the start pinching
SHE'S A NATURAL in concert with BAVARIAN CREME, and then forced that foe to steady, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung five wide into upper stretch and folded. VIRTUAL BEAUTY chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing
at the seven-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, faltered, and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
MOVIE MOXY was fractious in the gate, reared badly at the start and was off very slow, settled on the outside, gained to make a bid in the four then three
path around the turn, shook clear outside the quarter-pole, drew away under the crop into the final furlong then was placed under a brisk hand-ride to the
wire while much the best. MIA BEA STAR settled off the pace, was urged inside to the two path around the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch
and got up for the place while no match for the winner. MY SWEET WIFE prompted the pace on the outside, took the lead in the three path at the
three-eighths then dropped to the two path while losing the advantage outside the five-sixteenths, lost touch with the winner into the stretch and weakened
then was caught for the place while well clear for the show. VALLARAND showed the way down the backstretch, lost the lead while in the two path at the
three-eighths then dropped back, moved to the three path later on the bend and tired. AMITY ISLAND settled on the outside, was urged four wide around
the turn, dropped in near the three-sixteenths and failed to respond.

Footnotes
BABA disputed the pace between horses then inside of a rival late on the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, shook clear into upper stretch, responded well
while drifting out some in the final furlong and held under steady urging. CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE settled on the outside, moved closer while three to five
wide around the turn, was asked for her best into upper stretch, chased the winner to the wire and was second best. ALARM CLOCK showed speed on the
inside of two foes, dropped back late on the backstretch, chased in the two path around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved out around
the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick while able to safely secure the show. ITS COLD IN DEHERE settled at the rear, moved from the two path to
the four path around the turn, came five wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. HYDRA was coaxed along off the pace, gained five then four wide
around the turn, chased into upper stretch and tired. TRIPLE P tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied four then three
wide around the turn and came up empty. SISTER ANNIE contested the pace on the outside, came up empty in the three path on the turn and retreated
then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
PHOEBE'S FROSTY disputed the pace between horses, vied in the two path around the turn, dropped back in upper stretch, kept on in pursuit of the leader
in the final furlong, came again into the final sixteenth and got up under strong urging to prevail. REGALITY was hustled from the gate, showed speed on
the inside of two foes, dropped back then moved out around the nine-sixteenths, made a bid in the four path on the turn, gained the lead outside the
quarter-pole, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. PRINCE OF JOY settled off the pace, rallied five wide on the
turn, gained to make a bid late on that bend, remained on his inside lead in the stretch and flattened out then weakened while able to get the show. RIA'S
ANGEL was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. EXXTOP settled
on the far outside, was urged six wide around the turn and failed to threaten. JADE'S DREAM broke in and bumped with a rival, angled in while off the pace,
was urged along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. STORM SHOOTER broke through the front of the gate prior to the start but
remained in the stall, disputed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn and tired. VOLIERO was bumped at the start then taken up and
dropped back, spotted the front several lengths, dropped well behind, saved ground on the turn, came out at the quarter-pole and trailed.
