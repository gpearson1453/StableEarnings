Footnotes
MY SISTER PAM settled off the early pace inside, challenged toward the three eighths pole but checked in tight at the rail approaching the quarter pole,
recovered stride and was eased off the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch handling and cleared toward the wire WAGER WORTHY in the final
yards. The latter rated the pace off the rail, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was steadily handled leaving the turn, gave up the lead in
later yards but held on for second. PETTYFORURTHOUGHTS stalked off the rail, challenged leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail
and was gaining on the runner-up. I SHALLBE RELEASED rounded the first turn about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the rail
on the far turn but flattened inside the eighth pole. WOODSONG'S CASTLE rounded the first turn five wide, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole,
raced in the four path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. HOOK THE CHAIN raced in the six path the first turn, picked up the chase from the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and showed little in the lane. GOLD PHOENIX raced four wide on the opening turn and showed little
response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
JAMESTOWN ROAD rated close inside, bid leaving the quarter pole and came between horses mid turn, took the nod two deep leaving the turn and was
kept alert to hold off FEEL THE LOVE through the stretch, while the latter saved ground off the pace and picked up the chase nearing the three eighths
pole, drew aim three wide approaching the top of the lane, but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. HOW IS SHE raced well off the pace and off
the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and came along for third the final yards. MISS
WAVE stalked two deep then challenged into the backstretch, took the nod nearing the seven sixteenths pole, came under pressure toward the three
eighths, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn but was met leaving the turn and flattened stride. ARROWWOOD stalked from the three path,
challenged toward the three eighths pole and stayed in range in the three path of the far turn before weakening. SECRET CASTLE bobbled leaving the gate
but took the lead nearing the thirteen sixteenths pole and moved to the inside to set the pace, gave up the nod at the seven sixteenths pole, chased from
that point but faded at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
ELVIRUS saved ground well off the early pace, started his bid nearing the three eighths pole, steadily improved in the three path of the far turn, dueled to
the front past the eighth pole and drew off the final sixteenth. ONE MORE FACTOR rated the early pace inside, was met leaving the first turn and dueled to
recover the edge passing the three eighths pole, drew clear at the quarter pole, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn but was met past the eighth
pole and relented the final sixteenth. FIVE STAR PHIL raced in the five path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through
the far turn at the rail, eased out leaving the turn, cleared third past the eighth pole and ran evenly in the lane. JAMMIN STILL raced well off the pace in the
three path the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn then flattened
in the lane. TWEET THIS rounded the first turn about the four path, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far
turn, then flattened stride while losing ground toward the head of the lane. JACK THE RIPPER (FR) tapered in and raced with the early pace two deep,
moved to even terms and dueled with the edge from that point, was met passing the three eighths pole, dropped back at the quarter and weakened at the
rail. INSTIGATED rated off the pace inside on the first turn, picked up the chase into the backstretch but weakened at the rail on the far turn and was eased
in the lane. CONFUSION BABY BOY was through early.
