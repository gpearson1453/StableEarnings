MANY AMBITIONS Dueled three wide early stages, advanced with adjoining outside rival at three-eighths pole, match raced inside of rival until briefly losing
the lead at the three-sixteenths pole, battled back along the rail to regain the lead at the sixteenth pole, resolutely held off one final bid from nagging rival in
closing stages. ANGRY EMMY Stalked four wide into the first turn, commenced at the seven-sixteenths pole, joined inner rival at half mile pole, match raced
outside to the three-sixteenths where runner gained brief lead, overtaken at the sixteenth pole, made one final bid, just missed. OJO FELIZ Vied for lead
between rivals early, took out of spot at seven-sixteenths pole, asked from that point, never challenged top two. WITCHES DANCE Taken ahold of first turn,
two path, moved at five-sixteenths pole, not enough to have a say in result. GEBO Held rail and lead into the first turn, dueled with two outside rivals up to
the three-eighths pole where he was overtaken, never a match. DUKE CITY KITTY Taken back along the rail, asked at the three-eighths pole, never fired.

TEXAS LONG BOW Sent and dueled three wide into the first turn, went on with inner rival at the three-eighths pole, battled, took clear command into the
lane holding sway in the two path, drove clear to wire. SHEZ A GRINDER Dueled between opening stages, moved to rail with pressing outer rival, could not
outlast winner. PICK BYMY FRIEND Tucked in behind the leaders along the rail into the first turn, asked at the three-eighths pole, split rivals along the two
path at the eighth pole, made belated headway for minor awards. LIVE A GOOD LIFE Touch slow away from outer draw, stalked in the five path off of
dueling trio, fanned five wide into the far turn, evenly into the lane and to the wire. CURRENTLY KRAZY Dueled with two adjoined foes early stages, asked
to go on with it at the quarter pole, not enough, gave way. FOCUS FIRST Taken far off the pace, settled in rear, never factored.

ALPHABETICAL Vied from the break and cleared to the rail, dueled in a line of three up the backstretch, broke away and gapped field off the turn, drew
clear impressively. BRON AND THE BROW Dueled between throughout and into the turn, couldn't match move of the leader, willingly. DOUBLE THE
GOLD Stalked along the rail in a pocket, threatened at the three-sixteenths pole, belatedly between rivals. MUSICAL GEM Contended for lead opening
stages, taken back two wide to stalk at three-eighths pole, got out slightly on the far turn, outfinished. GOLD STAR STUDENT Dueled three wide, widest
turn, faded on wrong lead all the way to the wire. STAN THE HOT MAN Trailed throughout, never a threat.
