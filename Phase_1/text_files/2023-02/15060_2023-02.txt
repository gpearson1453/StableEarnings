INDIMAAJ was away alertly to go to a clear lead and set all the pack, proved much the best. HUMPHREY stalked the pace around the first turn then settle
in the middle of the pack down the backstretch, moved between horses at the three sixteenths pole then moved out three or four wide into upper stretch and
made a late run to just be up for the place. LIKEN IT raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn, made a three wide bid at the three eighths pole
and was no match for the winner and gave way grudgingly. AKHNAS was off the pace in the two path to the three eighths pole and weakened. QUANA
DUDE saved ground while being off the pace around the first turn then made a mild bid into the stretch but failed to menace. TRAELEE raced near the back
down the backstretch then moved to three wide around the final turn but had no response. COOL INDIVIDUAL was always back. CLEAR HUMOR was
forwardly placed to the final turn then retreated. BROAD DECISION was not involved.

Footnotes
SCREENPLAY went to a pressured lead to set the pace, pulled away on the final turn and held sway. BOTTOMLESS was unhurried down the backstretch
then made a four wide move on the final turn for a late run but was not enough. F J'S GEM was allowed to settle down the backstretch while racing in the
middle of the pack then made a three wide bid on the final turn, gave late interest to hold the show. INDEFENSIBLE was allowed to settle down the
backstretch then made a rail bid on the final turn, moved out to five wide in upper stretch for a late rally but was too late. GENIUS raced in the middle of the
pack down the backstretch then moved out to three wide at the quarter pole but was out finished. NUGGET OF GRACE raced in the middle of the pack
around the first turn, dropped back down the backstretch but was not a factor. JOEY'S LIGHTENING vied for the lead from the two path to the five
sixteenths pole and retreated. CARRIES MAN raced in the middle but was never a threat. DOUBLE PRIORITY pressed the pace from the three path to the
quarter pole and gave way.
