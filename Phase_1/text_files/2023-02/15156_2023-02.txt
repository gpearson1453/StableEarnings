coaxed along throughout, raced three deep in the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. S C ANGEL stalked the top pair, raced three wide around the far
turn, shifted in to race near the rail through the stretch run and kept on to the wire. CECILIA'S HOPE was off slowly, raced two deep and was even with no
closing run. WITCHY WINDSOR raced off the early pace, was four wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. SING THE SONG showed good early
foot from the inside and faltered the final eighth of a mile.

Footnotes
MR. WALSH showed good early speed to set the early pace and held gamely to be clear under strong handling. MURDO settled off the early going, moved
up near the rail around the far turn through the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. BIG HEARTED FACTOR stalked the pace, moved up four wide past
the three sixteenths pole and finished willingly to the wire. DREAM BABY DREAM stalked the pace from the inside and weakened the final eighth while
racing two wide. MAFIA DON was off very slow, lost a considerable amount of ground at the break, raced three wide in the lane and made a late gain.
NOSBOR stalked the pace and faded. THREE RUN HOMER turned his head at the start, spotted the field alot of distance at the break, race far back and
was eased up on to be distanced.
