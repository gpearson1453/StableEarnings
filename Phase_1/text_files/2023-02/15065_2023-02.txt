Footnotes
ALFIO tracked three wide early, rallied on the far turn and drew close, drew off late under left handed urging. WAITES KINGDOM dueled on the lead until
mid stretch, could not match strides late with the winner but was clearly second best. ANCIENT MAN was allowed to settle early, went evenly in the stretch
and was no threat to the top two. ZINFATUATION had good position on the inside and lacked a late response. BON DEUX dueled on the early lead and
tired on the far turn. BLUNDER was outrun.

Footnotes
KHOPILOT set the pace and was well rated on the front, remained clear in mid stretch, dug in gamely late and prevailed. ONE FOR THE MONEY was
unhurried early on the inside, angled out four wide on the far turn, closed willingly and just missed. INSACIABLE PRINCE was allowed to settle early, rallied
on the far turn three wide and drew close, then went evenly in the stretch. UNCLE DICK was slow early and trailed, improved on the inside while no threat.
SHEA D CAPTURE raced close up for three quarters, then gave way in the stretch. MY TWO AUNT JOANS contended for three quarters, then came up
empty. BAYTOWN BEAVER pressed the pace for five eights, then tired on the far turn. AWESOME BREAK had good position on the inside and was
through after a half.
