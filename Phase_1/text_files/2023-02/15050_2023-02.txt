CASEYS MEMORY was allowed to settle in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then move out to three wide at the five sixteenths pole to engage
the leader at the three sixteenths pole and took a short lead at the top of the stretch and dueled to the wire to win the nod. JAZZY JUSTIN went to the front
to set the pace through the final turn then was headed at the at the eighth pole and battled down the stretch from the inside and just missed. FREDONIAN
tracked the leader from the inside then made a mild bid on the final turn and proved best of the rest. SARCASTIC TONE stalked the pace from the two path
to the quarter pole and gave way. DRIED PEPPER reared as the gates opened spotting the field several lengths and was never a threat. GENTRIFIED was
always back.

Footnotes
SHE'S MY PRIORITY stalked the pace from the three path then made a bid at the quarter pole to engage the leader at the top of the stretch and drew clear
late. MO BELLA went to a pressured lead then was headed at the sixteenth pole and proved second best. BEAUX TOX raced in the middle of the pack to
the final turn then made a rail bid and moved out to three wide in upper stretch to show late interest. T R'S FIRST settled in the middle of the pack down the
backstretch then made a three wide bid at the five sixteenths pole to be best of the rest. CRIDER CHASE was off the pace around the first turn then was
allowed to settle down the backstretch but failed to menace. APRIORITY LADY was within striking distance from the three path then moved up to the
quarter but failed to sustain that bid. CUSTOM MAIDEN was unhurried through the final turn but was not a factor. DAVE'S RONDA pressed the pace from
the two path to the five sixteenths pole and weakened. CLOCKED IN TYME was always back. SPECTACULAR IZZY was forwardly placed around the first
turn then made a mild bid on the backstretch and gave way.

Footnotes
TEASIN' TESLA had a challenged lead while setting all the pace and drew clear late. START WELL was allowed to settle around the first turn then moved
between horses at the seven sixteenths pole, moving out to three or four wide at the five sixteenths pole then going out wider into the stretch for a late run to
be up for the place. FUHR MEO raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then moved up from three wide to stalk the pace down the backstretch
but showed late interest and just missed the place. CANDY'S PARADE pressed the pace from three wide to the top of the stretch and tired. US SECOND
CUTE PIE vied for the lead from the two path to the first turn then tracked the leaders down the backstretch and retreated. ANN'S STORM saved ground
through the final turn then made a mild bid on the rail to improve position. EL CALIENTE LADY raced in the middle of the pack but was not a factor. FLAT
ROSE was forwardly placed around the first turn then steadily faded.

Footnotes
PINCH ASSAULT was allowed to settle down the backstretch then made a four wide bid at the three eighths pole to engage the leader at the quarter pole
and took over at the three sixteenths pole to prove much the best. CHEROKEE TAKEOVER stalked the pace from the three path around the first turn then
made a bid at the three eighths pole to take a brief short lead at the quarter pole and was out kicked. WISE GUY broke out and bumped CYPRIANO at the
start, was placed off the pace and proved best of the rest. CYPRIANO was bumped by WISE GUY at the start, set a challenged pace to the final turn then
was headed on the turn and tired. GRIEF was unhurried throughout and passed tiring rivals. MUFFIN NUTS was off the pace from between horses, moved
out to three wide at the quarter pole but was never a threat. JOHNNYSJOURNEY pressed the pace from the two path to the final turn and gave way.

SUPER SPIRIT was hustled along to be off the pace early, made a three wide bid at the three sixteenths pole and ran down the leader in late stretch to
prevail. REQUITE THE EFFORT chased the leader early then moved to engage at the three sixteenths pole and took the lead in upper stretch but was
caught late and held the place. TROSKA raced in the middle of the pack, made a bid at the five sixteenths pole then moved out farther in upper stretch to
make a late run to be up for show. ALL AMERICAN PAT was forwardly placed then made a rail bid on the turn and into the stretch but faltered. MALLORI'S
MAGIC had no early speed moved up from three or four wide on the turn to improve her position. SUE'S LITTLE ZING hesitated at the start, then raced in
the middle of the pack and was not a threat. MARINA was away alertly to a clear lead to the quarter pole and tired. MORO MILE HIGH had no speed and
showed little. FLY TY saved ground in the middle of the pack to the three eighths, stopped and walked off.
