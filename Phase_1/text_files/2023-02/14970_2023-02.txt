Footnotes
JUANA GALLO came in to bump rival nearing the eleven-sixteenths marker, responded when challenged by UNRIVALED QUEEN nearing the
three-sixteenths pole, vied with that rival and held gamely. UNRIVALED QUEEN broke sharply then was bumped and checked nearing the
eleven-sixteenths pole, moved up to offer a bid to the winner nearing the three-sixteenths marker, vied and just missed. CREME DE MENTHE was
forwardly placed throughout, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. MS FLASHY HARBOR was off a step slow, lagged early, moved
four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. THE RIDER OF UNRIVALED QUEEN LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST JUANA GALLO
CONCERING THE BUMPING AND STEADYING OF HIS MOUNT AT THE ELEVEN-SIXTEENTHS POLE AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE
STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED JUANA GALLO FROM FIRST AND PLACED HER SECOND.

Footnotes
ALICESHOUSEOFHEART settled off the leaders early, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths marker and was up late.
CIVIL SUIT was away in good order to set a pressured pace, moved four-wide, through the turn, stayed on well in the drive and finished with good energy.
SIGNATURE COLORS pressed the pace from between foes, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole and gave way grudgingly late.
JEWEL OF DENIAL showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. MISS RENO settled off the leaders early,
moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly. CAMDEN HIGH was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. SHE
LOVES KARAOKE pressed the pace from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the nine-sixteenths marker, weakened and was eased through the
lane. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
BIG AL'S PRINCESS was away alertly to duel for the lead with FLYIN BY while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a quarter to run, drifted out
through the lane and held sway to the wire. FLYIN BY disputed the pace with the winner while racing four-wide, could not gain on that rival in the drive but
finished with a steady bid. LATER DAYS settled off the leaders from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with late interest.
YELLEN was forwardly placed from the inside and failed to gain in the drive. BANDON BRIDGE lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and finished
with a belated bid. A WHOLE LOTTA HULA settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. SQUARE
FOOTAGE raced off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and weakened. THE RACE WAS ORIGINALLY HAND TIMED, TIMES CHANGED
UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
DURANGO JESS was hustled along to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths marker and drew off through the lane with
complete authority. SPENDAHOLIC was away in good order to chase the winner while racing three-wide, could not gain on that rival in the drive but finished
well to be clearly second best. HARROVIAN settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and was up for the show. ASCOT STORM
showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, reached a contending position, bled and was vanned off. SOLEROCKER chased the leaders while
racing four-wide and gave way gradually in the drive. ROUSING RUBBLE settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and failed to rally. TAINO
HOUSE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. GOLDEN COWBOY lacked early foot, raced three-wide through
the turn and did not offer a bid. FLY BUDDY FLY showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not threaten. LIMITED OFFER raced off
the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
WILLY THE COBBLER tracked the leaders from the inside, moved up to take command with a furlong to run and quickly drew clear. PINTXOS was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, could not gain on the winner late but finished well to gain the place. MIKE
OPERATOR sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong. GOOD BYE PUTIN settled off the
leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished with a late bid. MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) was void of early speed, raced four-wide
through the second turn, checked in mid-stretch, angled out and rallied late. UPO settled off the leaders from the inside and finished evenly late. MY BOY
LOLLIPOP showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. HEY SEQUOIA lacked early foot, raced three-wide
through the second turn and did not offer a bid. FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going six furlongs.
