Footnotes
ON VACATION allowed to settle, saved ground along the first turn, advanced on the backstretch run, came within aim while two wide nearing the quarter
marker, battled for the lead in mid-stretch, assumed command inside of the furlong pole and kept to task in the late stages to prevail. BEA MISCHIEF
unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the quarter marker, angled out in upper stretch, loomed nearing the furlong marker, could not keep pace with
the winner in deep stretch and held for place. PEACEHAVEN rated off of the early pace, raced three wide along the first turn, stayed outside of rivals along
the backstretch run, steered four wide on the second turn, closed well in the drive and just missed for place, while clear of the rest for show.
KINDOFBLUEKITTEN saved ground in the early gong while on a snug early hold, was well positioned through the backstretch run, advanced two wide
nearing the quarter marker, vied for the lead in the drive but could not sustain that run and weakened in the late stages. BOSSY PEGASUS showed early
speed and cleared the field into the first turn, set moderate fractions to the quarter marker, was confronted by ON VACATION approaching the furlong
grounds and gave way in the late stages. ACHROMATIC forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, raced three
wide on the far turn, dropped back nearing the furlong pole and tired late. NATALIA shuffled at the start and was off slowly, allowed to settle, maintained a
two wide path to the quarter marker and lacked a response in the drive.

Footnotes
TROJAN CLUBHOUSE prominent in the early stages then assumed command along the first turn, carved out solid fractions while pressured through the
backstretch run, held ALOHA KITTEN at bay to the furlong grounds and drew away in the late stages. ALOHA KITTEN forwardly placed into the first turn,
stalked TROJAN CLUBHOUSE into the backstretch run then pressed that rival to the far turn, was held at bay to mid-stretch and could not match strides
with the winner in the late going, while holding for place. ZABAVA rated off of the decent early fractions, maintained position through the backstretch run
while well positioned, lost ground on the far turn, closed into the margin of the top two in the drive but lacked the needed late response. STOIC LUNA
unhurried in the early stages, roused two then three wide on the far turn, Chavez lost his crop in upper stretch and lacked a rally in the final furlong.
PREMIUMONSATURDAY allowed to settle, raced three wide into the far turn, swung widest for the drive and was not a factor. SHERILINDA stalked the
decent early fractions while closest to the top pair, lost position into the far turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
NOSHEWONT encountered traffic into the first turn and was shuffled to the rear in the early going, improved position along the backstretch run, continued
that steady gain on the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch run, came within aim of SMART KITTEN nearing the furlong pole, overtook the runner-up
inside of the furlong marker and kicked clear in the late stages. SMART KITTEN showed early speed and assumed command into the first turn, set modest
fractions while pressured through the backstretch run, shook free nearing the quarter marker, felt pressure from NOSHEWONT in mid-stretch, could not
match strides with the winner inside of the furlong grounds but stayed on well in the end to be second best. MISS ACCELERATE prominent in the early
stages, kept close attendance to SMART KITTEN through modest fractions to the half-mile marker, lost ground nearing the quarter pole, weakened in the
drive and held well in the end to secure the show. LEXCELLENT allowed to settle in the early stages, raced three wide along the backstretch run, gained
ground nearing the quarter marker, angled two wide for the drive and could not keep pace in the final furlong. A LITTLE GRACE stalked the early pace,
advanced position along the backstretch run, well placed into the far turn, mounted a three wide bid to come within aim nearing the quarter marker and did
not offer a rally in the stretch run. SUE GENEROUS forwardly placed into the first turn, was a bit keen while close up into the backstretch run, lost position
nearing the half-mile marker, dropped back on the far turn and lacked a late response. HALLELUJAH BABY bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly,
was a bit keen while in traffic on the first turn, settled into the backstretch run, was outrun to the far turn and did not threaten in the drive.

Footnotes
EMILY SMILES forwardly placed in the early going, tracked the fast pace to the turn, advanced two wide nearing the quarter marker, confronted SPUN
BEAUTIFUL leaving the turn, battled with that rival to the furlong grounds, shook free and drew away under hand urging in the final sixteenth. SPUN
BEAUTIFUL broke alertly and showed early speed to assume command, set solid fractions to the quarter marker, was confronted by EMILY SMILES
leaving the turn, battled with that rival to mid-stretch, could not keep pace in the late stages and just held for second. MAGICAL LADY crowded at the start
by BOLD DAUGHTER and was off a step slowly, recovered and chased the leaders to the turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker, swung four wide for
the drive, rallied in the late stages and just missed for place, while clear in the end for show. LION'S LAIR stalked the early pace, advanced while saving
ground nearing the quarter marker, continued that bid to mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong. HEAT SEEKING LETA lacked early speed, raced
three wide into the drive and was not a late factor. BOLD DAUGHTER broke in at the start, crowded MAGICAL LADY and was off a step slowly, lacked early
speed, dropped back on the turn and did not threaten in the drive.

Footnotes
MR. FIGHTER asked for early speed and was forwardly placed in the early stages, dueled outside of LOOKSGOODONYOUTHO to the turn, assumed
command and extended the lead nearing the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch, had the margin cut into in the final sixteenth but kept to task to stay
clear to the wire. PRACTICAL BID bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to chase the pace to the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter
marker, swung four wide for the stretch run, closed with good interest in the drive, was not able to impact the winner in deep stretch but finished well to earn
the place. PERFORMATIVE chased the solid early pace, was green and climbed in the running into the turn, was floated out a bit by
LOOKSGOODONYOUTHO in upper stretch, closed in the final furlong but was outkicked in deep stretch and held for show in the late stages.
LOOKSGOODONYOUTHO broke alertly, dueled for early pace duties with MR. FIGHTER, lost ground to that foe on the turn, floated PERFORMATIVE out
a bit at the top of the lane, weakened in the stretch drive and was outfinished for third. MR BIG DEAL lacked early speed, raced four wide into the drive and
did not factor. TIGER HEAT unprepared at the start and spotted the field leaving the break, trailed to the turn, improved position nearing the quarter marker,
ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not threaten in the late stages. LIL KOWBOY showed brief foot in the early stages, could not keep pace to the turn and
tired.

Footnotes
GARDEES WORLD engaged with WICKED SUNSET for the early lead then took command approaching the turn, sped to a clear lead nearing the quarter
marker, widened the margin nearing the furlong pole and kept to task in the late stages to be much the best. SILK ROAD SALLY allowed to settle in the
early stages, raced two wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed well in the late stages while on the left lead, was no match for the
winner in deep stretch but stayed on to hold safely for second. BOUNDFORJAMAICA chased the fast early pace, was outrun on the turn while three wide,
swung four wide into the lane, finished evenly in the drive and kept on to secure third. WICKED SUNSET broke alertly, engaged with GARDEES WORLD to
contest the early pace, ceded the lead to that rival heading to the turn, chased to the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch, weakened in the drive and
was outfinished for third. CLOCHARD STREET bobbled at the start, hit the gate and was off awkwardly, recovered to chase the fast early pace, lost ground
while four wide on the turn, gave way in upper stretch and lacked a late response. HALF HOPING allowed to settle in the early stages, came five wide to the
quarter marker and did not offer a late response. KISS RIDE GOODBYE lacked early speed and was not a factor. DANGEROUS ILLUSION chased the fast
early pace, lost ground while chasing from the rail on the turn, could not keep pace in the drive and tired.

STAR RACER settled off of the decent early fractions, saved ground along the turn, tipped out two wide at the top of the stretch, chased WAR GAMES to
the furlong pole, collared that rival nearing the sixteenth-marker and drove clear under firm hand urging in deep stretch. RAGER unhurried in the early
stages, raced two wide to the quarter marker while not far back, slipped to the rail in upper stretch, gained ground nearing the furlong pole, shifted out inside
of the furlong marker, was outkicked in deep stretch by STAR RACER but closed in the late stages to secure second. IRREFUTABLE broke alertly, took
back and stalked the decent early pace, raced two wide to the quarter pole, lost ground nearing mid-stretch, was outfinished in the late stages and held for
third. WAR GAMES sent to establish the early lead, set decent fractions while rating on the front end, drew to a clear advantage nearing the quarter marker,
was set down for the drive and maintained a clear lead to mid-stretch but could not hold off STAR RACER inside of the furlong pole and weakened. MY
SUMMER DREAM tracked the decent early pace, raced three wide to the quarter marker, could not keep pace in the drive and gave way.

Footnotes
MARY WALKER broke outward at the start, was content to track the pace down the backstretch and through the turn, quickened approaching the quarter
pole, battled with OTTER POP the length of the stretch run and managed to out-finish that one despite drifting out to the middle of the track under
left-handed encouragement. OTTER POP broke alertly and went for the lead while angling towards the rail, held a clear advantage to the head of the
stretch, was challenged on the outside by MARY WALKER, dueled that one to deep stretch and was outfinished. SASSY TINKERBELL broke a bit slow and
was fighting the rider and hard to place in the run down the backstretch, settled down on the turn but had only one horse beat to the quarter pole, waited for
racing room at the top of the stretch and kept to task when clear finishing well enough to gain third. CUTE RENEGADE broke in a bit and brushed with
LUCKY LOCKETT at the break, then was bumped hard by that one and forced towards the gap, losing momentum and a few lengths to the rest of the field,
chased the field to the turn, began to improve position passing the three-eighths pole despite a wide trip then made a good run down the stretch to just miss
out on a minor award. SHE'S FANCY LIKE broke with the pack but pushed to keep up through the first quarter mile, came under heavy pressure from the
half-mile pole, was four-wide into the stretch and finished one-paced. AWESOME MAUI GIRL raced in mid-pack through the early going, was still with a
chance at the quarter pole but was unable to find another gear when needed in the stretch. LUCKY LOCKETT broke in at the break brushing with CUTE
RENEGATE, those two came together again a few strides later with the latter getting bumped towads the gap, rushed up along the rail to contest the early
pace, settled for a stalking position on the turn tipped out a path for the stretch run but had nothing left.
