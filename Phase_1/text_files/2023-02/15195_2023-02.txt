not catch the leader, then rallied in the early stretch to gain command this time and held on well to prevail. EVIE'S PRINCE tracked the pace down the
backstretch into the far turn while five wide, then rallied gamely in the upper stretch to close well for the place prize. BRICK TOWN was three wide entering
the first turn to set the pace down the backstretch, was in a long drive throughout the far turn, was used up and gave way in the end. CINCO RICHIE
tracked the pace between rivals on the backstretch into the far turn, then menaced in the upper stretch but came up empty in the end. AIR FORCE ANGEL
tracked the pace along the inside, was in a steady drive to make a bid on the far turn then gave way in the stretch. HEMPSTEAD was unhurried early and
no threat. C. F. CONGRESS settled along the inside throughout the course and was no menace. CALIPARI was unhurried early and no factor.

the early stretch, gained command in the final furlong and held on well till the end. WILBURNSCLASSYLADY was unhurried early, then saved ground on
the backstretch, swung six wide on the far turn, dug in gamely and closed strongly for the place position. XTRA SPICY was away well to press the pace into
the first turn and onto the backstretch, then was moving up on the far turn to duel for lead, took over in the upper stretch but was outbid by an outer rival and
held on well for the show prize. LEXINGTON DIVA stalked the pace while three wide, was in a steady drive to bid from the four path on the far turn then
closed well in the stretch. WOO HOO tracked the pace from the inside into the backstretch, then made a mild bid on the far turn and was no threat. JAGO
lead the way into the first turn to set the pace down the backstretch, then dueled to keep the lead on the far turn but was used up and tired in the late
stretch. KAUSE I'M DEVINE was unhurried early while five wide on the backstretch, then bid on the far turn and was no menace. L L COOL GREY raced in
