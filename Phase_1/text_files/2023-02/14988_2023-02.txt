Footnotes
FROSTED FAITH dueled inside GRANDE SOIREE while racing in the two path then drew off under left-handed urging in the lane. WHEATSHEAF raced in
the clear off the duel in the two path, angled four wide near the quarter pole, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch and churned on to gain
the place. BLAST THE MUSIC steadied early, saved ground off the pace, tipped two wide in the lane and rallied between foes to gain the show in the final
strides. GRANDE SOIREE dueled outside of the winner to upper stretch, could not keep pace from there, continued on the left lead in the lane, lugged in
leaving the eighth pole and lost the show late. ROCK SOLID WORDS failed to menace while racing three wide. MUD BUG steadied at the start, dropped far
back in the two path and was never involved. WILLWORKFORFOOD played no factor while racing four wide. QUEEN DE LA CREME was through early
and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
SMOKIN CLOUD set the pace in the two path, was roused nearing the quarter pole, opened up while floating out to the four path passing the eighth pole,
and was much the best. ADIOS YOUR HONOR prompted the pace in the three path, was ridden around the turn and in the six path entering the lane, and
kept on to secure place. MOUSEFAST bumped with an inner foe leaving the gate, raced off the pace in the five path, was under right handed urging while
fanning out to the eight path turning into the stretch, and improved down the center to get up for show. IRON LOTUS broke out at the start, tracked in the
two path, had to steady approaching the turn, was driven along while swinging out to the seven path into the lane, but flattened in the final furlong. SEAX
trailed in the two path into the turn, was coaxed along the rail around the turn but had to steady slightly approaching the quarter pole, and was no factor in
the stretch. FASTFORFUN had a slow start and bumped with an outer foe, rated in the four path early but never threatened. ALDO'S DREAM stalked along
the inside but yielded passing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
FORTY FLASH lacked early speed inside, angled out nearing the turn, advanced four wide around the bend, closed outside, was up near the sixteenth pole
and powered clear. NAVAL OFFICER was bumped at the start, raced off the pace four wide, rallied between foes, reached near even terms near the
sixteenth pole but was no match for the winner from there. BAHAMIAN CAPTAIN bumped with NAVAL OFFICER at the start, stalked the pace from the rail,
bid inside of the pacesetter in upper stretch and was kept in tight quarters by that foe through the stretch run. COUNT DOWN pressed the pace in the three
path and weakened in the final sixteenth. HELL'S KITTEN set the pace in the two path, was collared near the sixteenth pole and steadied off heels in deep
stretch. UNLONELY chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. MAJOR KING steadied entering the turn, saved ground and never threatened.
RARE JEWEL trailed outside.

Footnotes
FEDERAL EXCHANGE tracked in the four path, was coaxed rounding the turn, swung out to the six path and was cued right handed entering the lane,
rallied to bid going into the final furlong, took over and drew clear. FISHING FOR FUN dueled for the lead in the opening quarter along the rail, took back
and was prominent from said position around the turn, had to steady approaching the quarter pole and was in the two path entering the stretch, tipped back
inwards to the rail in upper stretch, and kept on for place. I FOUND IT stalked in the three path, was driven from the five path into the stretch, and stayed on
for show. PACIFIC LEGEND rated in the two path, was roused around the turn and moved up but was stymied in the three path entering the lane, shifted in
to the two path passing the eighth pole but finished evenly. EL GUAPO chased in the five path, moved up under rousing around the turn and bid in the four
path entering the stretch, but flattened around the eighth pole. NATURE BOY dueled for the lead into the turn from the three path, took command and
shifted inwards around the turn, was under right handed urging while floating back out to the three path entering the lane, but yielded passing the eighth
pole. CAJUN BAYOU trailed throughout around the six path.

around the far turn and weakened in the lane. STRONG EMBRACE tossed her head at the start, saved ground and never threatened. BLUSTERY broke in
a tangle, saved ground off the pace, made good progress inside around the far turn, lacked a clear path in upper stretch, checked near the eighth pole and
dropped back. OOOH BARRACUDA had early speed inside, tipped two wide to press the pace around the first turn, raced well off the rail down the

UNCAPTURED STAR broke in at the start and prompted the pace along the rail, was coaxed to bid around the turn, took the lead and was cued right
handed from the two path at the top of the lane, opened up passing the eighth pole, and held on while under left handed urging late. BERNARDO'S
LEGACY stalked in the three path, was ridden around the turn and floated out to the six path entering the stretch, and kept on for place. DON'T ANSWER
broke slow and rated in the two path, had to steady going into the turn, swung out to the seven path entering the lane, and ran on for show. NIGHT RIDE got
bumped by an outer foe leaving the gate and was wellback while tipping out to the five path approaching the turn, was under a drive while fanning out to the
nine path into the stretch, and was no factor. MOONCAPTURE set the pace in the two path, lost the lead around the turn and was ridden from the four path
into the stretch, and faded. ETRETAT tracked in the three path but never threatened. FREE SMOKE broke in and bumped an inner foe, chased along the
inside but was never a menace. DECISIVE PRIDE got bumped between foes at the start and trailed throughout around the five path.

PEACH COBBLER saved ground off the pace, angled four wide in upper stretch, closed outside and was up in the final strides. BEANTOWN BABY trailed
in the two path, angled to the rail in upper stretch, rallied inside and just missed. CHROMEPLATED HEART dueled in the two path, was getting out around
the turn then fought on between foes through the stretch. CROWDING OUT dueled outside of CHROMEPLATED heart, battled on between rivals through
the stretch and was outfinished. ADIOS BABE chased the pace two and three wide, angled five wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. LADIES'
CHOICE chased the pace four wide and faded through the lane.

Footnotes
UNIFIED WEEKEND bumped with an outer foe leaving the gate, tracked in the two path, was coaxed between rivals around the far turn and bid while
tipping out to the four path entering the lane, drifted out while taking the lead approaching the eighth pole, was corrected right handed, and drew clear.
MCMONEY bumped with an inner foe at the start and then brushed with an outer foe just after, stalked in the four path, was driven from the five path into
the lane, and kept on while floating slightly inwards under left handed urging for place. NOVA FOLHA raced prominently in the three path, took command
around the far turn and was roused from said position into the stretch, but evened out in the final furlong for show. SUPER SPREADER rated along the
inside, was driven around the far turn while angling out and was in the six path at the top of the lane, but was one paced. HARD MISSION brushed with an
inner foe just after the start, settled off the pace in the three path, ranged up under rousing in the six path turning into the stretch, but flattened. PLUMA
ROJA trailed in the five path into the far turn, went wide into the stretch, and never threatened. MEHLEK got bumped between rivals at the start, set the
pace along the inside but yielded around the far turn.

Footnotes
PARKLAND settled in range in the two path, advanced three wide around the far turn, reached near even terms approaching the quarter pole, battled
outside of SWASHBUCKLE to the sixteenth pole then drove clear late. EXTRASEXYBIGDADDEE was off a step slow, raced off the pace three and four
wide and rallied for the place. SWASHBUCKLE had speed in the four path around the first turn, set the pace well off the rail down the backstretch, angled
into the two path early on the far turn, fought on inside of the winner from the quarter pole to the sixteenth marker and just missed second. MAJOR WAGER
raced well back two wide, swung seven wide in upper stretch and rallied. OUR COUNTRY trailed in the two path, swung eight wide in upper stretch and
rallied belatedly. LAKER MAMBA saved ground off the pace, went two wide between foes around the far turn and was one-paced through the lane.
CHARLES CHROME tracked the pace three wide, angled to the rail in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. J P HELLISH set the early pace
inside, chased inside around the far turn and faded through the stretch. UNO TIGER broke a bit awkwardly and made little impact while racing four wide.
