Footnotes
MANNFORD pressed early, dueled on the lead three wide until mid stretch, drew clear late under firm handling. KISSINGER had good position early, rallied
in the stretch on the inside, finished willingly and was second best. JACK BE FAST was never far back, rallied in the stretch four wide and finished well.
ROLLIN ON TEQUILA set the early pace, dueled on the lead and weakened in mid stretch. BIG OHIO was unhurried early, saved ground and was no
threat. DREAM PRIZES had brief foot, and was through after a half. IT'S A MANS WORLD was no factor. ROSCO P. COLTRANE broke in a tangle and lost
his rider and walked off. The stewards posted the inquiry sign but took no action.

Footnotes
BIG BAD BEAST never far back, shifted to the four path past the furlong marker, closed with a burst of speed and got up in time. SCRATCHOFF away
alertly, set the pace into the stretch, shook clear before the eighth pole then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. WICKED CHANCE trailed into the
turn then had a mild late rally four wide. TONKAWA SPRINGS close up, dropped back on the turn then came on again late along the inside. NITROMAN
pressed the pace two wide into the stretch and weakened late. R CARDINAL PRINCE went evenly. PRIVATE CONNIE stalked the pace along the inside for
a half, shifted out to the five path then weakened.
