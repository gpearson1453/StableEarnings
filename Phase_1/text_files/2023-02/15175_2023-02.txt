Footnotes
INFINITE EMPIRE rated close to the early pace off the rail, pulled herself to the lead approaching the seven sixteenths pole and was rated from that point,
moved clear in the three path midway on the far turn, left the turn wide and was kept in hand through the stretch. SOMEBODY LOVES ME saved ground
into the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and cleared second mid-stretch. LINDA'S TAJ drew clear and
angled to the inside to set the early pace, was met approaching the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at mostly even terms leaving the pole, but dropped
back midway on the far turn and flattened in the lane. LIL BOSS rounded the opening turn about the three path, bid passing the seven sixteenths pole,
raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. MORE TAJ raced well off the early pace in the three and four paths and could only improve her
position. MIDSUMMER NIGHTS rounded the opening turn about the five path, left the turn outside and gave chase toward the three eighths pole, but
weakened into the far turn.

three paths of the turn and dueled through the stretch for third. DIXIE YODELER chased outside, raced in the four and five paths of the turn and finished

Footnotes
MOONLIT SHADOW angled in and closed to the front at the thirteen sixteenths pole and raced with the early pace, came under pressure toward the three
eighths, dueled clear of Far Away Love mid-stretch and held on with steady handling. DRY WELL ducked out and made sharp contact with Timeisgolden
leaving the gate then steadied in tight at the heels of FAR AWAY LOVE shortly afterward, saved ground on the first turn then gave chase into the
backstretch, rounded the far turn about the four path and dug in to take second the final yards. FAR AWAY LOVE (ARG) raced with the pace, gave chase
leaving the three eighths pole but dropped back approaching the quarter, continued a factor through the upper stretch but flattened the final sixteenth.
TIMEISGOLDEN was bumped outward and into Baci leaving the gate then pinched back, rounded the first turn off the rail, gave chase nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and finished well. MISS CHAMITA raced well back saving early ground, picked up the chase nearing the five
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and finished well. BACI was bumped leaving the gate and steadied off the inside flank of Moonlit
Shadow shortly afterward then rated close, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened in the lane. After a
Stewards inquiry and subsequent claims of foul by both the trainer, and rider of Timeisgolden, against the rider of Dry Well for interference at the start, the
Stewards disqualified Moonlit Shadow to last place for causing a chain reaction shortly after the start.

Footnotes
TIMMY exchanged contact with Mr. Hostler leaving the gate then closed to the front nearing the nine sixteenths pole and rated the pace, came under
pressure leaving the three eighths, dueled at mostly even terms from that point and dug in determinedly to eke out the nod over the game challenge of GET
OFF MY CLOUD, who stalked inside and picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, dueled at mostly even terms leaving the pole and dug in gamely
to the finish. LEG UP was bumped leaving the gate then exchanged contact with CHIPPEWA'S CASTLE shortly afterward and rated close through the front
stretch, was forced wide on the opening turn, left the turn outside and gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path
and ran evenly in the lane. The latter was bumped after the start then forced out into the first turn, angled in past the five eighths pole and gave chase into
the backstretch, but faded off the rail on the far turn. CHASE LIL ME settled back two deep on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths
pole then flattened in the four path of the far turn. MR. HOSTLER exchanged contact with Timmy leaving the gate and made contact with Leg Up shortly
afterward, saved ground on the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little more. REY O REYES set the
early pace inside but lost action behind and nearly lost his rider into the first turn, bore out through the turn and entered the backstretch four wide, gave
chase from the three eighths pole, weakened into the far turn and was eased in the lane. The Stewards reviewed the incident into the first turn before
posting this race official.

Footnotes
SHINY PENNY raced with the early pace then stalked three wide into the first turn, drew to even terms and dueled from the three eighths pole, moved clear
midway on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. ONEPRETTYTHING leapt from the gate and entered the first turn in the five path, angled in
past the half mile pole and gave chase from the seven sixteenths, raced near the rail on the far turn and dug in to take second the final yards. CALYPSO
GHOST set the early pace inside, was met and dueled at even terms from the three eighths pole, but dropped back toward the quarter pole, raced at the rail
on the far turn and relented second in late yards. STYLISH PAINT settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths
pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and ran evenly through the lane. SEEDS OF TIME rounded the opening turn in the four path then eased out into
the backstretch, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five and six paths of the far turn and finished well. HAD THE NOTION
raced well back in the five path the first turn, left the turn outside and bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the six path, raced outside
into the backstretch and finished evenly. CHEESE LOUISE saved early ground, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the
three path and flattened stride. SUPERSTASIA was never a factor. SHACKABOOM raced with the early pace two deep while between horses, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole but dropped back past the pole and faded readily while losing ground on the far turn.
