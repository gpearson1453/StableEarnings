Footnotes
GAGLIANO dropped back under urging while showing no speed then moved out at the rear, was ridden along on the far outside, fell back while moving from
the five path to the three path and climbing some around the turn, was driven six wide into upper stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed well
in a long drive with big strides to win going away. R GIRL FAITH stalked the pace while held together down the backstretch, was asked in the three path on
the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, chased under a drive into the final furlong, made a bid into the final sixteenth but proved no match for the winner
late while able to get the place. SIMPLE SUGAR went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, traveled around the turn in the two path, was
challenged by an inside rival at the three-eighths, responded well when given her cue inside the five-sixteenths, was asked for her best in upper stretch,
swapped to the proper lead outside the furlong marker, led under a drive to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken and missed the place while clear for the
show. RACING COLORS broke out at the start, settled on the outside, moved closer with five furlongs to run, was roused in the four path on the turn,
chased five wide into the stretch, pursued the leader under a drive into the final sixteenth and weakened. INFRINGEMENT came away in front, settled just
off the pace on the inside, came through along the rail to make a bid with three furlongs to run, dropped back under urging in upper stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
BANKERS DAUGHTER three wide in closest aim of the leader, advanced on that rival half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took
over command with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and drew clear under a drive kept to task. REIGNING CHICK brushed at
the start, got jostled between foes soon after the break while just off the inside, tucked inside briefly nearing the turn before getting out and being corrected
two to three wide at the seven-sixteenths getting tucked back along the inside midway on the turn, angled out five wide into upper stretch and kept on to
secure the place honors. TRUE EMPRESS jostled with the aforementioned foe early on before settling in pursuit just off the inside, tucked inside into the
turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and stayed on one paced to the finish. GAME THEORY showed the
way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front with five-sixteenths to go, spun three wide for home and
weakened. DUCKPHAT three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and made no headway.
DEVILLY chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, tired.

Footnotes
CARLY HUSTLE settled on the outside, moved in near the five-eighths pole, was roused in the two path on the turn, angled out in upper stretch, closed fast
to get the lead inside the furlong marker then drew away under steady urging. PONCHO SONG was hustled from the gate, contested the pace between
horses, was given her cue while inside on the turn, battled inside opponents under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match for the winner but
willingly secured the place. RHUBARB MARTINI lost her footing at the start and was last away, stalked the leaders on the outside, issued a challenge in the
three path around the turn, led under urging into upper stretch, fought outside of two foes into the final furlong and weakened while clear for the show.
RAFFINITY was hustled from the start, disputed the pace down the backstretch, vied between foes while asked in the two path on the turn, battled between
rivals under a drive while remaining on her inside lead in the stretch and tired. SYNONYMOUS broke out at the start, moved out under urging at the rear,
reached the far outside near the three-quarter pole, was urged four then five wide around the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. EASY
PLAY showed speed on the inside of foes, dropped back under urging near the five-eighths, fell well behind while moving from the rail to the three path
around the turn and faltered.

five wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. JOKEMEISTER chased along the inside and then three wide through the turn, swung
three then two wide into upper stretch and weakened. CATCHING CUPID coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just
off the inside through the turn under coaxing from midway, spun just off the inside for home and tired. FENWAY dueled from the three path briefly with WIN
FOR GOLD before being shaken off through the turn steadily under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and folded. JELLY

Footnotes
HARLAN'S BOND broke in then brushed with a foe, went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked while inside on the turn, lost the
advantage to the runner-up into the stretch, fought on well inside that foe into the final sixteenth and got back up to narrowly prevail under a strong
hand-ride. CLOVER STREET broke out and hit the gate, settled comfortably on the outside, moved closer late on the backstretch, ranged up three wide to
make a bid on the turn, gained a short lead into the stretch, led under a drive while battling outside of the winner to the sixteenth-pole then was denied while
drifting out some but was well clear for the place. NORTHWAY chased the pace on the outside, vied in the two path while asked between foes on the turn,
dropped back into upper stretch and weakened while best of the rest. GOOD ACCELEBRATE showed speed then chased the pace, dropped back while
inside to the two path on the turn and came up empty. BANDULU QUEEN was urged along at the rear, traveled around the turn in the three path, came out
into upper stretch and failed to threaten. BUSHWICK brushed with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, rounded the
turn in the two path and faltered.

Footnotes
DR ARDITO three then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing stacked four wide at the three-eighths, advanced to overthrow the early pace duelers in
concert with BANKIT nearing the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive dueling through the length of the stretch to the finish
in game fashion taking narrow command seventy yards from home and held it to the wire. BANKIT four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths between foes and advanced to take command spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in knocking heads through the length of
the drive to the finish clinging to command, got narrowly headed seventy yards from home and gamely fought on but was ultimately bested at the end. FULL
MOON FEVER tipped out after the start and chased five wide down the backstretch and through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs out, offered
up a bid swinging six wide into upper stretch, then proved no match for the top pair while keeping on to procure the show honors. WUDDA U THINK NOW
coaxed from the gate, dueled inside of SEA FOAM from the get go, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got displaced in tandem with his main pace
rival nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. SEA FOAM hustled from the gate intent on the lead, dueled from the
two path with the aforementioned foe to his inside, came under coaxing midway on the turn joined by the additional trio to the outside preparing to stack
across the track, yielded the front nearing the quarter pole in concert with his main pace rival, went two to three wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
BOURBON CALLING was last to commence, moved out at the rear under urging then settled on the outside, gained to make a bid at the half-mile pole, took
the lead in the six path midway through the turn, dropped to the four path while moving clear outside the quarter-pole, responded well when set down into
upper stretch, remained clear into the final sixteenth and just held while shortening stride significantly late. KING KUMBALAY moved out then settled on the
inside of a rival, moved up to make a bid late on the backstretch, vied in the the five then four path around the turn, moved back to the five path outside the
quarter-pole, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and just missed while clear for the place. PRACTICAL
COACH settled just off the pace, was asked while three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into stretch, moved inward in the final furlong and finished
willingly for the show. MARKET ALERT was well placed just off the pace, chased inside early on the turn, moved to the two then three path nearing the
five-sixteenths then hesitated off heels, was driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. CHESTERTOWN settled at the rear, moved
out leaving the chute, was asked while four then five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LOBSTA leaned in at the
start but came out in front, showed the way down the backstretch, was urged along in the two path on the turn, lost the lead at the three-eighths, dropped
back outside the quarter-pole and faded. NO BURN stalked the pace on the outside, vied in the four then three path around the turn, dropped back late on
that bend and capitulated.

WHAT'S UP BRO chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the
eighth pole, edged clear under a drive to prevail. KAZ PALACE dueled three then two wide with GOLD IN THEM HILLS to his inside, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got displaced from command nearing the eighth pole and ran on to secure the place honors.
LOOMS BOLDLY three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch offering up a bid for command, dug
in under a drive between foes nearing the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages while along safe for the show honors. PLEASE BE NICE five paths
off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing half a mile from home, swung five to six wide into upper
stretch and weakened. BOBBY THE TANK four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled three to four wide for home and weakened. MACDONOUGH chased four wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, went seven
wide into upper stretch, tired. GOLD IN THEM HILLS hustled from the start, dueled from the two path with KAZ PALACE to his outside, tucked inside
through the turn and began to fade near the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, faltered in the drive. SARATOGA BANKER stumbled at
the start falling heavily forwards and lost the rider as a result, recovered to run loose briefly before being apprehended by the outrider and was subsequently
vanned off.
