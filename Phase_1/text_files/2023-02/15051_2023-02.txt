Footnotes
AVATAL HERO prompted the pace in the three path, was floated into the six path in upper stretch, gained outside of the pacesetter and was up and clear
late. PINK PARTY PANTS set the pace in the two path, drifted into the five path in upper stretch and led until deep stretch. WICKED ICE chased the pace
three wide, was no match for the top two but was along late for the show. PARDON MOI raced in range three wide and lacked the needed rally. LEAD
PERFORMER stalked the pace from the rail and faded in the lane. BODIL saved ground and failed to menace. VALIANT SHI SHI played no factor while
racing two wide. JAZZY JAS made little impact while racing four wide. SHE'S RED HOT trailed inside.

Footnotes
JOURNEYMAN trailed in the two path, was roused along the inside around the far turn, waited for room passing the quarter pole, and found an opening in
the four path at the top of the lane, and rallied to get up in the final sixteenth. TAPSASIONAL set the pace in the two path, was coaxed along the inside
nearing the quarter pole and cued right handed in the three path entering the stretch, and ran on but was caught by an outer foe in the final sixteenth to
place. DOMINATE THEMOMENT prompted the pace along the inside early, was roused along the rail turning into the stretch, tipped out to the three path
passing the eighth pole, but evened out for show. GRAPE NUTS WARRIOR was reserved along the inside early, bumped out an outer foe midway down the
backstretch and was ridden in the five path around the far turn and into the lane, but was one paced. MALIBU UPROAR raced in midpack in the three path,
was driven between rivals around the far turn and in six path going into the stretch, but was no factor. CHARLIE G was hard held while up close in the four
path but faded in upper stretch. UNIVERSAL PAYDAY rated in the three path, got bumped out by an inner foe midway down the backstretch and was asked
while losing ground in the six path around the far turn, and failed to threaten. MORNING STRIDE settled in range in the five path down the backstretch, was
ridden in the four path around the far turn, yielded from the five path in the stretch, was eased around the eighth pole, pulled up just past the wire, and
vanned off.

Footnotes
SOPHIA'S STORM set a clear pace in the two path, drifted out a bit under left-handed urging and widened. RANSOMS REWARD raced off the pace four
wide and ran to gain the place. BULLET ON TAP chased the pace two wide, angled to the rail near the quarter pole, bid in midstretch but was outfinished for
the place. SHE'S OUTTA HERE prompted the winner in the three path and weakened in the lane. SHES A GIFT was up close inside, tipped two wide
leaving the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. CUPID AUSTIN steadied soon after the start, raced off the pace five wide,
continued on the left lead in the lane and never threatened. PROVOCATIVA trailed in the three path.

Footnotes
NATIONAL UNITY stalked in the two path, was ridden in the three path around the turn and urged right handed in the four path entering the stretch, tipped
out to the six path passing the eighth pole, and rallied to get up in final strides. D COLDEST prompted the pace in the four path, was cued right handed in
the five path turning into the lane, ran on to take the lead passing the eighth pole, but was caught by an outer foe in the final strides to place. BOURBON
THERAPY was hustled along off the pace in the three path, got bumped out by an inner foe passing the half mile marker and was driven in the five path
around the turn, floated out to the seven path into the lane, and kept on down the center for show. COURAGEOUS COPPER set the pace in the two path,
was roused along the inside around the turn and tipped out to the three path entering the stretch, but yielded in the final furlong. CARABINERO chased in
the two path early, bumped an outer foe while tipping out passing the half mile marker and was roused in the four path rounding the turn, stayed on in the
six path in upper stretch, but flattened out in the final sixteenth. HOUSEBUILDER trailed throughout from the two to four paths.

Footnotes
SHE'S SO PRETTY bumped with an inner foe at the start then brushed with an outer foe just after, was hard held up close between foes around the first
turn, raced prominently in the three path down the backstretch, was roused to bid around the far turn and into the lane, edged past the inner pacesetter
inside the final sixteenth, and just held off a late charging outer rival to win. MACHISIMA was rank at the start and clipped heels just after, rated in the four
path, was roused nearing the quarter pole and in the five path entering the lane, ran on down the center under right handed urging to get up for place late,
and just missed the win. SERENADE A KITTEN was keen in the three path around the first turn, set the pace in the two path down the backstretch, was
under right handed urging while tipping into the rail in upper stretch, dug in thru the stretch, but was caught by a pair of outer foes late to show. KHOSEA
tracked in the four path, was driven around the far turn from said position and into the lane, and stayed on between foes under left handed urging and
brushed with an inner foe late. HOT BODE raced wellback in the three path early, was coaxed around the far turn and swung out to the seven path entering
the lane, and finished evenly. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS settled in midpack in the three path, was cued right handed turning into the stretch and in the four
path in upper stretch, kept on while angling in thru the final furlong and was stymied late while brushing with an outer foe. DOMINEERING stalked in the two
path but faded along the inside in the stretch. THRILLING BABY trailed in the two path early, fanned out very wide into the lane and never threatened.
MIDNIGHT PIRATE raced off the pace inside, and was no menace while out in the nine path turning into the stretch. LA RUSIA bumped with an outer foe
leaving the gate, led along the rail around the first turn, prompted the pace down backstretch but gaveway going into the far turn.

Footnotes
VLADISLAV settled in range inside, advanced three wide between foes around the far turn, swept to the front leaving the eighth pole, drifted out under
left-handed urging late and lasted. HONESTO raced well off the pace two wide, advanced six wide around the far turn, closed down the center of the track
and just missed. CAPE COD broke a bit awkwardly, raced off the pace inside, tipped three wide near the quarter pole, lacked a clear path through most of
the stretch run, angled in late and was up for the show. SIR SAMUEL settled off the pace three wide, advanced five wide around the far turn, bid in
midstretch then flattened out late. BIRD WILDCAT pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead near the quarter pole, vied between foes past the eighth
pole, could not keep pace with the winner from there then was taken in hand late when CAPE COD angled in in his vicinity. SOUPER ROYAL MOON set
the pace in the two path and weakened in the final furlong. WORLDS ON HIGH saved ground and failed to menace. SON OF LIBERTY tracked the pace
four wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
FROZEN SOLID broke out at the start and brushed an outer foe just after, stalked in the two path, tipped out around the turn and was coaxed while taking
aim from the five path at the top of the lane, and rallied to draw past a pair of inner rivals in the final furlong for the win. FIRENSPICE prompted the pace in
the three path, was roused to bid around the turn and into the stretch, ran on to take a narrow lead and was cued right handed into the final furlong, but was
caught by an outer foe late to place. MISS SAKAMOTO set the pace inside, was headed while tipping out to the two path turning into the lane, and kept on
but was outrun by a pair of outer foes in the final furlong to show. DESIGNED BY KITTEN bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the five path,
brushed with an inner foe into the turn, was roused in the four path around the turn and cued right handed into the stretch, and mildly gained. JOIN THE
DOTS was unhurried in the two path early, was short of room going into the turn, coaxed while tipping out to the three path into the lane, angled out to the
five path passing the eighth pole, but was unable to factor while improving late. MISS DOMINA had to steady in the opening quarter, raced in midpack in the
two path, was roused midway around the turn, but flattened in the stretch. CARDIO PRINCESS (JPN) rated in the five path into the turn, floated out to the
seven path into the stretch, but never threatened. SAMMY'S TOWN got bumped between foes at the start, raced from wellback in the three path but was no
menace while out in the eight path in the stretch. DOLL BABY broke out and bumped with an outer foe leaving the gate, tracked in the four path, brushed
with an outer foe into the turn, and gaveway into the stretch.

Footnotes
FREE TO ROAM vied between foes down the backstretch, dueled inside around the turn, was headed leaving the eighth pole but dug in inside to prevail.
MEETMEATTHEBEACH set the pace inside down the backstretch, dropped back entering the turn, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths marker, re-bid
outside of the winner in upper stretch, dueled outside of that foe to the wire and just missed. OUR FORTUNE COOKIE broke a bit awkwardly, raced in
range two and three wide and stayed on for the show. FOREVER UNCAPTURED chased the pace three wide and lacked the needed rally between foes in
the lane. NO ACTION had speed three wide between foes down the backstretch, chased in the four path around the turn and lacked the needed rally.
MOONLIGHT VISION failed to menace while racing three wide. RUN FOR COVER played no factor while racing two wide. MISS BIA was outrun while
racing four wide. CAHUILLA was outrun inside. MEGAN MAKIN MONEY broke outwardly, dueled four wide down the backstretch and three wide around the
turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and wilted. NOBLE LADY made little impact while racing three wide. BAHAMIAN SKY trailed inside.
