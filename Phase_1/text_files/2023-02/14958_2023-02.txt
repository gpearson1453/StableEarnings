Footnotes
THE CALABRESE KID took back off of the fast early pace, roused three wide into the stretch run, closed the gap on PARTY FOUL nearing the
sixteenth-marker and drew clear in deep stretch while hand ridden to the wire. DRUMADOON tracked the fast early pace, raced closest to the loose
pacesetter on the turn, chased PARTY FOUL to mid-stretch, could not match strides with THE CALABRESE KID in deep stretch and held for second in the
final stages. TIZ A THRILL allowed to settle, raced outside of rivals on the turn, swung four wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, mounted a late bid
and was up for third in the final strides. TOM'S MOON unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the top of the lane, rallied while racing on the left lead
inside of the furlong grounds, shifted outside of a tiring rival in deep stretch and just missed on the wire for show. PARTY FOUL prominent in the early
going, assumed command and set fast fractions into the turn, drew clear nearing the quarter marker, in hand to the top of the lane, began to weaken nearing
the furlong pole, was overtaken nearing the sixteenth-marker and tired in the final stages. RUNAWAY PRINCESS showed good early speed and contested
the fast pace with PARTY FOUL, could not keep pace with that rival on the turn and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
MISS MAIA took back off of the fast early pace, advanced two wide nearing the quarter marker, closed well in mid-stretch, overtook AMANDA ROSE
nearing the sixteenth-marker and fended off a game runner-up in the final strides to prevail. SHE'S A BIT SASSY settled in the second flight through the
backstretch run, rallied three wide nearing the top of the lane, advanced into mid-stretch, finished well in the final sixteenth, challenged the winner in the final
strides but could not get by the determined MISS MAIA and held safely for second. AMANDA ROSE raced closest to the loose pacesetter, advanced
nearing the quarter marker, took command leaving the second turn, set down for the drive, was all out to hold off MISS MAIA nearing the sixteenth-marker,
was overtaken by the winner and was outfinished by the top pair in deep stretch, while well clear for third. BEIGNET hopped at the start, was away slowly
then steadied in traffic into the first turn, unhurried through the backstretch, two wide into the stretch run and made a mild late rally. SNOW HILL unhurried in
the early going, trailed to the quarter marker, advanced two wide in upper stretch, failed to sustain that bid and weakened. SOMETHINGNEFARIOUS
showed early speed and dictated terms to the first turn, drew off along the backstretch run while setting solid fractions, was reeled in nearing the quarter
marker and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
EXTINGUISHER broke alertly, took back in the early stages and stalked the moderate pace to the turn, angled three wide nearing the quarter marker,
gained ground nearing the furlong pole, overtook PACIFIC ZIP nearing the sixteenth-marker and pulled away in deep stretch. PACIFIC ZIP prominent in the
early stages then ceded the lead to GUNGAGUNGAGALUNGA into the turn, advanced to press outside of that rival to the quarter marker, battled for the
lead to mid-stretch, could not match strides with EXTINGUISHER in the final sixteenth and held for place in the end. JUBILEE LAKE (GB) rated off of the
early pace, saved ground to the top of the lane, was asked for run in upper stretch, offered a mild late bid and was up for show in the final strides.
GUNGAGUNGAGALUNGA pulled on the rider while between runners in the early going and established the advantage into the turn, set moderate fractions
through the turn, was pressed by PACIFIC ZIP to the quarter marker, held that foe at bay to mid-stretch, could not keep pace with EXTINGUISHER inside of
the furlong marker and gave way in the late stages. FINNLEY'S KITTEN chased the early pace from the second flight, advanced outside of rivals on the
turn, came four wide to the quarter marker, could not keep pace in the drive and weakened in the final furlong. OAT MILK LATTE lacked early speed, raced
two wide to the quarter marker, raced evenly to mid-stretch and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
MR. IMPOSSIBLE Came away best and was allowed to set the pace in hand against modest fractions, came into the stretch on the rail then moved
mid-stretch out to get beside LONG LANCE when that one making a run at the lead, had something left and held off that rival in a gritty effort. LONG LANCE
reserved early while under some restraint, was always close through the early going, moved closer into the far turn, was steadily making up ground on the
leader but was rebuffed in mid-stretch and came up short. DULAS (IRE) content to sit off the flank of MR. IMPOSSIBLE through the early stages, was set
down with a quarter mile to go and finished well but but was outrun to the wire. BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) raced at the rear of the field but not far off the pace,
began a sustained bid past the half mile pole while three wide through the turn and into the stretch, ran on well but was unable to crack the top three.

Footnotes
MYSTIC TBILISI broke in at the start and crowded SYNNIN AND WINNIN, contested the early pace then took a narrow lead approaching the turn, set
moderate fractions while pressed to the quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch, held SYNNIN AND WINNIN at bay inside of the furlong marker and kept
to task in deep stretch to hold over the oncoming runner-up. THE SANDY SURPRISE was bumped and crowded at the break by SYNNIN AND WINNIN,
rated off of the moderate early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, chased to mid-stretch, finished well in deep stretch, challenged the winner in the final
strides but could not reel that one in and was up for second. SYNNIN AND WINNIN was crowded leaving the break by MYSTIC TBILISI and in turn crowded
then bumped THE SANDY SURPRISE at the start, disputed the early pace then took back off the moderate fractions nearing the turn, saved ground to the
quarter marker, was roused in upper stretch, drifted out nearing the three-sixteenths marker and impeded WAKES AND WEDDINGS, advanced from the
inside nearing the furlong pole, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and was outfinished for place. WHISPER AND WINK tracked the moderate early
pace, raced two wide to the quarter marker, came in tight and lacked room approaching the top of the stretch, navigated around WAKES AND WEDDINGS
taking up at the three-sixteenths marker and closed willingly in the final furlong. VIVA LEON JODIDO bobbled at the start and was off slowly, lacked early
speed, trailed to the top of the lane, improved position in the drive but could not muster the needed late response. WAKES AND WEDDINGS away in good
order and was forwardly placed in the early stages, pressed the moderate pace to the outside of MYSTIC TBILISI on the turn, lost contact with that rival
leaving the turn, was impeded and took up nearing the three-sixteenths marker, dropped back in the drive and lacked a late response. THERE WAS A
STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING IN UPPER STRETCH. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT WHILE WAKES AND
WEDDINGS WAS IMPEDED BY SYNNIN AND WINNIN WHEN THAT RUNNER DRIFTED OUT AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH, THE INCIDENT WAS
NOT ENOUGH TO COST WAKES AND WEDDINGS THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE
ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
GRIT AND CURIOSITY allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground to the quarter marker, was roused four wide for the drive, loomed nearing the
furlong marker, drew to even terms with AUTISM BLUE nearing the sixteenth-marker, took a narrow lead in deep stretch and dug in in the final strides to
prevail. AUTISM BLUE tracked the fast early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, vied for the lead nearing the quarter marker, battled for the lead in
upper stretch then assumed command nearing the furlong pole, met the bid of GRIT AND CURIOSITY nearing the sixteenth-marker and was just edged out
in the final strides for the win, while holding for second. FOREIGN PROTOCOL took back off of the fast early pace, raced three wide on the turn, swung five
wide into the stretch run, closed well inside of the furlong marker, could not reel in the top pair in deep stretch and secured the show in the late stages. I'M
CORFU bobbled leaving the start but recovered quickly, showed early speed and disputed the fast pace with LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS, dueled from the
inside on the turn, battled for the lead with AUTISM BLUE in upper stretch then chased that rival to the furlong marker, could not sustain that run in deep
stretch and weakened. PHANTOM DROP chased the fast early pace, saved ground on the turn and did not mount a late rally. LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS
hustled leaving the break, engaged with I'M CORFU and dueled with that foe through fast early fractions, was joined by AUTISM BLUE on the turn and vied
between runners to the quarter marker, dropped back leaving the turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
PROSPECT OF RAIN a bit fractious in the gate, was away in good order and took back off of the early pace, advanced nearing the second turn, loomed
three wide nearing the top of the lane, brushed with JERRY JEFF WALKER in upper stretch, vied for the lead at mid-stretch, assumed command inside of
the furlong marker and kept to task in deep stretch to hold off the oncoming runner-up. DOS VICIOS broke out at the start and was off a step slowly,
unhurried in the early stages, trailed to the half-mile marker, improved position nearing the quarter marker, rallied three wide into the stretch run, finished
well inside of the furlong pole, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and was up in time to secure the place. JERRY JEFF WALKER stalked the
moderate early pace, saved ground to the second turn, waited for a few strides nearing the top of the lane then drifted out in upper stretch and brushed with
PROSPECT OF RAIN, vied between runners nearing the furlong marker, was outkicked by the winner in the late stages and was outfinished in deep stretch
for place, while clear of the rest for show. STORMY JOE hustled leaving the break and dictated terms early on, tried to lug out along the first turn and set the
pace while off of the rail, was still a bit hard to place along the backstretch run but maintained the advantage to the quarter marker, was set down for the
drive, felt pressure from his stablemate nearing the furlong pole, could not go on with PROSPECT OF RAIN in the late stages and gave way. MONEY
MUNCHER allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground to the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late response. BIG DIFFERENCE
forwardly placed into the first turn, tracked the moderate fractions while two deep through the backstretch run, advanced three wide nearing the quarter
marker, could not sustain that bid into the drive and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MCGEORGE allowed to settle in the early going, slipped to the rail entering the turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker, angled out in upper stretch,
closed with a rush inside of the furlong marker, came within aim in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to secure the win. ALEXANDER'S DREAM
broke alertly then ceded the early lead to STORMIN GALILEO, was prominent in the early stages, stalked the decent fractions to the quarter marker, chased
the pacesetter to mid-stretch, took a narrow lead inside of the sixteenth-marker, was all out in deep stretch and was tagged in the final strides for the win,
while just holding for place. REFI NOW away in good order, stalked the decent early pace, raced between runners into the turn, gained ground while
chasing STORMIN GALILEO to mid-stretch, vied between rivals in deep stretch, was gamely bested in the final strides and just missed for the win and
place. TOLONISITO rated off of the decent early pace, advanced while outside of rivals on the turn, swung four wide into the drive, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, gained ground in the late stages but was outkicked in deep stretch. STORMIN GALILEO asked to show early speed and assumed command in
the first furlong, set the pace to the turn, extended the lead while setting decent fractions to the quarter marker, held foes at bay to the furlong pole, was
overtaken by ALEXANDER'S DREAM nearing the sixteenth-marker and was outfinished in deep stretch. AMANOFMYSTATURE forwardly placed in the
early going, chased the solid pace from the inside, came in tight midway through the turn, took up off of heels and lost position nearing the quarter marker,
re-grouped and offered mild late rally in the stretch, while not able to impact the leaders. TOFINO BAY unhurried in the early stages, trailed to the quarter
marker and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
SHOTGUN EXPRESS (IRE) pushed from the gate to get a forward position, settled in a tracking spot behind STONE'S RIVER and bided time to the far
turn, went to challenge for the lead just past the three furlong pole, was even up by the top of the lane, battled that foe the length of the stretch and was able
to gain an advantage inside the sixteenth pole. STONE'S RIVER away best of all and immediately sent for and seized the early advantage, rated kindly
through the early stages, quickened into the far turn, was still hold the lead when challenged by SHOTGUN EXPRESS (IRE) and fought that one gamely,
weakening in the final yards. GALLANT WARREN came away well and got a good inside trip through the first turn, raced inside but away from the rail down
the backstretch, got boxed in through the far turn, tipped out for the stretch run into the path of OTTAWA FIRE (IRE) and finished up well enough to gain
third. BUENISIMO off a bit slowly and shuffled to the back at the start, settled at the rear of the tracking pack through the early going, made gradual forward
progress down the backstretch, slipped inside of GALLANT WARREN to get a rail run into the far turn,ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late kick.
HOUSE OF LORDS stumbled at the start then was not pressed for speed early on, lagged at the rear of the field, picked up the pace when asked passing
the half mile marker, had to wait for room through the far turn, rallied on well from the quarter pole, altered course near the eighth pole forcing OTTAWA
FIRE (IRE) into CHIEF WILD EAGLE, and finished well. OTTAWA FIRE (IRE) was close up but wide through both turns, fought the rider and was hard to
place during the backstretch run, made a wide bid through the far turn, was within striking distance at the top of the stretch, shied from GALLANT WARREN
near the eighth pole, then was forced out by HOUSE OF LORDS in turn causing some contact with CHIEF WILD EAGLE in the shadow of the wire. CHIEF
WILD EAGLE away well but forced three wide through the first turn, tugged the rider forward down the backstretch then loomed a threat with three furlongs
to go, lost some ground midway through the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, got bumped by OTTAWA FIRE near the eighth pole and lost some
momentum in the late stages.
