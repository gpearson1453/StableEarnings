Footnotes
FLOCKED was never far back, rallied in the stretch four wide, prevailed after a long drive under firm handling. BON DEUX was away alertly and quickly
made the lead, was hooked in mid stretch and continued on gamely to hold place. GREEN MILLENNIUM was unhurried early, swung wide in the stretch
and found his best stride late. WAITES KINGDOM chased the speed throughout and went evenly late. ALFIO had good position on the inside, lacked room
in the stretch, angled out late but could not gain. INSACIABLE PRINCE tracked four wide and was no threat late.

back, rallied in the stretch and drew close, could not get past the winner but was clearly second best. SEEKING THE MONEY had good position, on the
inside and went evenly late. ANIMO STAR raced mid pack, saved ground and was no threat. FAITHFUL SOLUTION had good position on the inside and
lacked a late response. BEAUTIFUL LASS allowed to settle, failed to menace. LATE DATE was unhurried early, and was no menace. KERRI'S MIRACLE
raced close up for three quarters, then weakened. SWEETER THAN HONEY was no menace . GIMME CLEARANCE outrun.
