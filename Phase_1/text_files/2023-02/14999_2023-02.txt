Footnotes
COOL CATOMINE showed good early foot to set the early pace along the inside of rivals and drew off to be clear under strong handling. MR. WALSH was
off a step slow, stalked the pace outside foes and finished well to be second best. MAFIA DON chased from the two path early on, raced between in the
stretch run and kept on to the wire. SANCOCHO (MEX) rated along from the inside, made a rail bid to challenge near the eighth pole and flattened out.
GONE PREACHIN dropped back early and failed to respond.

FASHION FACT showed good early foot to set the early pace and held well to be clear under strong handling. QUEEN CORDELIA chased the early pace,
raced four to five wide in the lane and got up for the place position late. SEGOVIANA was hustled throughout and moved up three wide and made a late
gain. SLUSHY coaxed along from the inside and weakened. LEMONS IS GONE raced four wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. CHERISH THE
DAY dropped back early, raced three to four wide and never was a factor. NEBRASKA RED chased the early leader and gave way. SHE'S AN ANGEL
trailed throughout. The three eighths fractional time was unavailable.

Footnotes
JAGGED ARROW vied for the early lead while racing three wide outside of foes and finished well to be clear under strong handling. AUNT IRENE chased
the early pace, moved up four to five wide and made a good late rally. TAYLOR'S BEAUTY vied for the early lead from the inside and kept on to the wire.
AFLEET OKIE was void of early speed and moved up from the outside through the stretch run. S C ANGEL vied for the early lead between rivals and faded.
BLUEBIRD DAY raced three to four wide and never was a factor. SING THE SONG hustled from the inside, checked sharply near the three eighths pole
and tired.
