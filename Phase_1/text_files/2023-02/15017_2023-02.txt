Footnotes
PIPER'S CAUSEWAY away in good order and was hustled to the early lead, set solid fractions to the quarter marker, drew clear under left-handed urging
nearing the furlong marker and kept to task in deep stretch to prove best. STRENGTH OF AUTISM allowed to settle, advanced three wide on the turn,
swung four wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed in the final furlong, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and was second best.
STOLEN VOTE stalked the solid early pace, raced three wide to the quarter marker, could not keep pace in the stretch run and was clear for third in the late
stages. CHILLY WILLY shuffled at the start then steadied in traffic in the early stages, chased the solid pace from the inside and finished evenly. ITS
THIEVERY lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten in the stretch. ZHIVAGO asked to show early speed, pressed the solid
pace into the turn, chased PIPER'S CAUSEWAY to the quarter marker and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
NOLDE bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, was reserved in the early stages while not far back, asked for run three wide on the far turn, swung
four wide for the drive, came within aim nearing the furlong marker, made a grinding advance in deep stretch and kept to task in the final strides to prevail.
TABLE FOR TEN tracked the modest pace from the inside, was roused nearing the top of the lane, advanced to vie for the lead nearing the furlong pole,
battled gamely in deep stretch and was bested in the final strides, while securing second. LIL MIRACLE MAN assumed command after an alert beginning,
set modest fractions while well rated through the backstretch run, quickened the pace on the far turn, held foes at bay to mid-stretch, battled stubbornly in
deep stretch and was outfinished in the late stages, while clear of the rest for third. EAST RAND allowed to settle, saved ground to the far turn and lacked a
late response. SHOT OF A LIFETIME forwardly placed in the early going, attended to the pedestrian fractions to the second turn, lost position nearing
mid-stretch and gave way. SYNC well placed in the early stages, raced two wide to the quarter marker and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
CIELO DIAMANTE allowed to settle in the early going, roused four wide on the turn, advanced nearing the furlong marker, closed with a rush in deep stretch
and surged in the final strides to prevail. CRYSTAL PROOF close up in the early going, tracked LA PRIMER ESTRELLA to the turn, dueled outside of that
rival to the quarter marker, assumed command leaving the bend, drew to a clear lead in mid-stretch, felt late pressure, was all out in the final strides and
was nailed for the win, while just holding for place. TAMANTARI shuffled in the early going while in traffic leaving the chute, chased from the rear to the turn,
saved ground to the top of the lane, closed fast inside of the furlong marker, found her best stride late and just missed for the win and place, while securing
the show. TAMARA MINE away a step slowly, crowded TAMANTAR leaving the chute, tracked the moderate pace to the turn, swung two wide for the drive,
advanced nearing mid-stretch, was gaining in the late stages but did not offer the needed late response. CITY GLITTER chased the moderate early pace,
lost position three wide on the turn, dropped back leaving the bend and tired. LA PRIMER ESTRELLA away in good order, showed good early speed and
dictated terms to the turn, dueled inside of CRYSTAL PROOF to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and faded in the drive.

MANY MARKETS unseated the rider in the post parade, was crowded at the start and was away slowly, lacked early speed, raced three wide to the quarter
marker, angled four wide in upper stretch, closed fast nearing the furlong pole, assumed command inside of the furlong marker and drew away in an
impressive debut. HANNAH IN A HURRY chased the moderate early pace, raced four wide into the turn, shifted in and bumped MORO FIRST CLASS
entering the turn, slipped inside approaching the top of the lane, advanced nearing mid-stretch, was blocked inside of the furlong marker, found room in
deep stretch and was up for second in the final strides. MORO FIRST CLASS chased the moderate early pace, was bumped by HANNAH IN A HURRY
entering the turn, advanced nearing the quarter marker, angled three wide for the drive, was outkicked inside of the furlong marker and was outfinished for
second in the final strides, while holding safely for third. MISSING PENNY broke alertly and assumed command in the early stages, set the pace to the turn,
dueled to the quarter marker with FIREBALL MOLLIE while setting moderate fractions, battled to mid-stretch, could not keep pace in the final furlong and
gave way in the late stages. GRANOLA GIRL close up to the early pace, stalked three wide on the turn and lacked a late rally. FIREBALL MOLLIE rushed
up leaving the break, prompted the pace to the turn, pressed the pace outside of MISSING PENNY to the quarter marker, battled for the lead with that rival
to mid-stretch and faded in the final furlong. DARK INTENT crowded MANY MARKETS at the start, was away slowly and was slow into early stride, lagged
through the turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
ROUSING JEWEL stalked the quick early pace from the inside, gained ground on the pacesetter nearing the half-mile marker, assumed command leaving
the three-furlong pole, drew to a clear advantage in mid-stretch, felt late pressure from MASTERY KAT and dug in under steady urging to prevail.
MASTERY KAT rated off of the quick early pace, saved ground to the far turn, closed willingly in the drive, put late pressure on ROUSING JEWEL but could
not reel in the winner and was second best. DELUSIVELY unhurried in the early stages, roused two then three wide on the far turn, floated out MAJESTIC
OOPS nearing the quarter marker, advanced in mid-stretch, finished well but was unable to impact the top pair late, while well clear of the rest for third.
SMILING LADY broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set the pace from the two path into the backstretch run, carved out solid fractions while four
wide to the half-mile marker, lost the lead to ROUSING JEWEL along the far turn, lost ground in upper stretch and tired in the late stages. BLACK ZABAT
forwardly placed into the first turn, lost contact with the top pair nearing the half-mile marker, dropped back on the far turn and lacked a late response.
MAJESTIC OOPS allowed to settle, raced two wide into the far turn, was floated four to five wide nearing the quarter marker and did not threaten in the
drive.

Footnotes
PRINCE ABU DHABI bumped with TRINIDAD at the break and was away a step slowly, unhurried in the early stages, raced two wide to the quarter marker,
swung four wide for the drive, encountered traffic in upper stretch, shifted in inside of the furlong marker, closed with a rush in deep stretch and prevailed in
a drive. ZEUS' WAR steadied in early traffic, chased the fast pace to the turn, improved position while four wide nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, was gaining in deep stretch but could not hold off PRINCE ABU DHABI in the final strides and was outfinished for the win, while besting the
rest. RACHEL'S COACH showed early speed and was sent to contest the early lead, dueled with ABINADI to the turn, shook free of that rival nearing the
quarter marker, extended the lead in mid-stretch, was confronted by the top pair nearing the sixteenth-marker, could not hold those two off and weakened
late, while holding safely for third. STRUT ON LOUIE forwardly placed from the rail in the early stages, chased the fast pace to the quarter marker, ran
evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late rally. TRINIDAD chased the quick early fractions, raced two wide into the turn, came in tight nearing the quarter
marker, was shuffled back leaving the turn and tired in the stretch drive. ABINADI broke alertly, disputed the early pace with RACHEL'S COACH, lost
position on the turn, raced three wide into the drive and gave way.

SONOMA DREAMING bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, was a bit green in the early stages, settled along the rail heading to the turn, gained
ground nearing the quarter marker, loomed nearing the furlong marker, assumed command and kept to task in the final stages to prevail in a good debut.
RAUCOUS TIZZY crowded SMILE AND PROFILE at the start, was unhurried in the early stages, raced three wide along the turn, advanced in the drive,
closed well in the late stages, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to secure second. SMILE AND PROFILE crowded at
the start by RAUCOUS TIZZY and was away slowly, was allowed to settle in the run to the turn, advanced two wide nearing the quarter marker, came in
tight in upper stretch, steadied and was blocked for several strides, recovered and gained ground nearing the furlong marker, finished well in deep stretch
and was just edged for second, while holding in the end for third. DRINKUP BUTTERCUP was away in good order, stalked the early pace, advanced two
wide nearing the quarter marker, lost ground in the drive, was outkicked in the final furlong and was outfinished for the minor awards. GET MY POINT
chased the moderate early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, could not sustain that bid in the stretch and weakened. CONQUEST ROCKS showed
good early speed and dictated terms to the turn, set moderate fractions to the quarter marker, held foes at bay to the furlong grounds and gave way in the
late stages. SHEZA QUEEN BEE chased the moderate early pace, raced three wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CHASE THE CHAOS settled in the second flight in the early going, saved all of the ground to the far turn, tipped out three wide at the top of the lane, came
within range approaching the furlong marker, kept to task under left-handed encouragement, overtook HARCYN nearing the sixteenth-marker and showed a
good late kick to edge away in deep stretch. GILMORE took back in the early stages while well placed, tracked the solid fractions from a ground saving path
to the far turn, rallied and came within aim nearing mid-stretch, was outfinished by CHASE THE CHAOS in the final sixteenth and held safely in the end for
place. HARCYN away in good order, tracked the fast early fractions, raced closest to the loose pacesetter through the backstretch run, loomed nearing the
top of the lane, battled for the lead with NULLARBOR to mid-stretch, took a narrow lead inside of the furlong pole, could not keep pace with CHASE THE
CHAOS in deep stretch and just held for third. PASSARANDO unhurried in the early stages, raced two wide into the backstretch run, roused along the far
turn, improved position nearing the furlong pole, closed willingly in the final furlong and just missed for show. NULLARBOR off a half-step slowly but showed
good early speed and cleared the field into the first turn, set solid fractions while on a long lead through the backstretch run, came back to the field nearing
the top of the lane, held foes at bay to mid-stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. SEA DOG allowed to settle, was steered three wide into the
backstretch run, improved position on the second turn, rallied two wide into the stretch, could not sustain that bid in the late stages and finished evenly in the
final furlong. IN HONOR OF AUTISM tracked the solid early pace, raced three wide into the backstretch run, maintained position to the far turn, was outrun
in upper stretch and gave way. HAPPY DOES allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground to the quarter marker, trailed into the drive and was not a
factor.

Footnotes
NORTHERN ROSE well placed early taking an inside tracking spot behind the pace setters, was let loose with a half mile to run then put into a hard drive
passing the five sixteenths pole, split the leader and a challenger at the head of the stretch then held off the field while drifting out in the final yards under
repeated left handed urging. HERE COMES RALPHIE reserved early while saving ground, had to wait for racing room on the far turn, swung out to the four
path entering the stretch and was finishing best but unable to collar the winner. SECRET SQUARE from the break grabbed a share of the lead without being
asked, raced in side of DEL MAR FLASH to the far turn under moderate fractions, let that one get away at the three furlong marker, found a second wind at
the top of the stretch and ran on well for third despite having to navigate a shifting sea of horses down the lane. LADY IN A HURRY tracked the leaders to
the outside of NORTHERN ROSE, moved with that one on the far turn to challenge for the lead, stayed on well but was outfinished in the shadow of the
wire. ALESHA outrun to the first turn, remained well behind the field down the backstretch, started a sustained rally from the seven-sixteenths pole, was still
last but loomed a threat at the top of the stretch, was gaining some ground when encountering a wall of horses mid-stretch and was unable to progress any
further. NICOLE GRACE was caught three wide on both turns, swung six-wide into the stretch, attempted to rally into contention, was not making up much
ground in the late stages and had to dodge a mass of horses drifting into her path in the final yards. DEL MAR FLASH broke well, went for the early lead
with little encouragement, raced in tandem with SECRET SQUARE to the far turn, attempted to get a jump on the field passing the three furlong marker and
opened up a clear lead, was challenged and caught at the quarter pole, was unable to muster a response but held position to the final furlong then
weakened.
