outside of rivals while racing five past the quarter pole and finished well to be clear late under steady pressure. BEING CREATIVE was off the early pace,
moved up two wide near the quarter pole, swung six wide into the upper stretch and rallied willingly to the wire. CAIRO SUMMER stalked the pace along the
inside, raced three wide around the far turn, angled widest in the stretch run and improved position. MOANA'S TALE was unhurried early, made a good
moved up into the lane and flattened out with no final run. TICKLISH raced mid pack early on, was four deep in the stretch run and had no response.
HALOFIED stalked the pace, made a early three wide bid near the three eighths pole and faltered in the drive. FREE TO RUN pressed the pace from the
outside of foe and weakened. LADY MECHANIC showed good early foot from the inside and gave way.

COME SEE ABOUT IT showed good early foot to set the early pace with a clear into the backstretch, met bid near the half mile pole to be pressed from the
outside, responded well to be clear late under strong handling. NIGHT TIME RULER stalked the pace, asked near the half mile pole to press from the
outside of foe, couldn't match strides with winner and held the place position late. FALCONS FURY was rated along early to race in hand, asked through the
far turn, swung seven wide and finished willingly to the wire. VISUAL MISSION was void of early speed, raced two to three wide in the lane and had not
enough. UPTOWN broke awkwardly, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start, moved up from the inside down the backstretch to stalk the top pair
and faded.

CAUSE OF LOVE chased the early pace from the inside down the backstretch, swung wide into the upper stretch, shifted in through the stretch run and got
up late under strong handling. KICHI KITSU showed good early speed to set the early pace along the inside, had a clear lead nearing the sixteenth pole and
was wore down late to narrowly hold the place position. DANCIN' ROSIE raced off the early pace, was four wide near the quarter pole and slowly closed in
on the top pair. ROLLIN ALL THE WAY was coaxed outside of foe and weakened a bit in the final stages. CATABOUT raced off the early going, angled
widest into the stretch and never threatened. LEXY ANNA was coaxed along from the inside, was shuffled back near the three eighths pole and tired in the
drive. CHLOES ANGEL dropped back early, raced along the inside around the far turn and lacked a bid. QUEEN AIR vied for the early lead while racing
between rivals, stopped and bled.

APPEALING SENORITA rated along early, made a three wide bid near the five sixteenths pole to take command and drew off late to be clear under steady
encouragement. CROSSED UP pressed the early leader from the outside, dropped back a bit through the far turn, re-bid in the lane and narrowly got up for
the place position while racing five deep. EASTER PRIDE race mid pack early on, moved up from the outside in the lane and finished willingly to the wire.
LARSA showed good early foot to set the early pace along the inside and weakened a bit late. MY PINK BABY BIRD dropped back off the early pace, raced
two three wide around the far turn and lacked a bid. WAR MOON dropped back to the rear early on, angled wide into the upper stretch and never
threatened. MILWAUKEE CAT raced off the early pace, was near the inside around the far turn and lacked a rally. PRICEY APPEAL was slow early, raced
three wide near the quarter pole, angled out through the stretch and never menaced.
