Footnotes
LUCKY AS A SEVEN alternated for the advantage outside then prevailed narrowly after a long stretch drive. REFUND RIGLER dueled along the inside
throughout and lost the head bob at the wire. MR. BRIGGS stalked the pace outside, vied three wide from midway on the turn to the finish. MR. TUTTLE
steadied slightly between foes after a quarter mile then flattened out. VERO SUN chased off the leaders and lacked a rally. CLASSY UNION dropped well
behind inside and was never a factor. DON'T RECALL trailed far behind then caught a stopping rival. DOUGIE chased outside and weakened steadily. A
claim of foul by the fourth finisher against the winner for interference on the backstretch was dismissed. PER RULING FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA
RACING COMMISSION, LUCKY AS A SEVEN WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR CROP VIOLATION.
