RIGHT TO SUE sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, responded when challenged by SUPER INTENSE nearing the quarter and
held that rival at bay to the wire. SUPER INTENSE broke sharply to stalk the pace of the winner while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the
quarter, could not get by that foe in the drive and finished willingly. ARMAVEER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn,
angled out into the stretch and finished with good late energy. HERMISTON was forwardly placed early, raced off the rail through the turn and failed to rally.
SCRATCH ME showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out approaching the stretch and did not menace.

THIRD WHEEL was away in good order to duel for the early advantage while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off as a
handy winner. HEIR (FR) raced four-wide through the first turn, pressed the pace while racing four-wide, was no match for the winner in the drive but
finished well to hold the place. PLAYOFF BOUND was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished with some
late run. YOU'RE THE CAUSE showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. MAJOR ATTRACTION was forwardly
placed from the inside and gave way in the drive.

YANKEE HUMOR sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and held MY KACEJJ safe in the drive. MY KACEJJ was reserved just off
the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. THE GOLDEN EGG settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide
through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with a late bid. YANKEE TEA PARTY raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide
through the turn, reached a striking position approaching the stretch and gave way in the drive. MISTER MAFIOSO lacked early speed, raced five-wide
through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and did not menace. MONGOLIAN APPLE lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. SCOPELLO chased the leaders from the inside for three furlongs and weakened.

Footnotes
RED VENUS broke sharply to stalk the pace of SASSY CAT while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths marker, opened a
clear margin with a quarter to run and held PRANCE safely to the wire. PRANCE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the
second turn, reached a striking position inside the furlong marker but failed to get by the winner in the drive. GOLD INCLUDED lacked early speed, raced
three-wide through the second turn, checked in mid-stretch and failed to rally. LEXOPHILIA was off a step slow, settled off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the second turn, lacked the needed rally and was unsaddled in the back-stretch and vanned off. SASSY CAT sprinted clear at once, raced
off the rail while setting the pace and gave way after going five furlongs. ALL NATIVE showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn,
angled out further approaching the stretch and was not a factor.
