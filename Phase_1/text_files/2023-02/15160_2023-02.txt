Footnotes
ORO DE MORO MORO well off the duel down the backstretch, was under urging near the three eighths pole, circled the turn, angled to the six path in
upper stretch, closed outside horses, led late and drove clear. YOUNG TURK stalked the duel in hand, moved up three deep leaving the turn, gained a short
lead in upper stretch and continued willingly. ON THE ENGINE saved ground around the turn, remained along the inner rail through the stretch and offered
a slight rally. CRIMSON ROCKET disputed the pace outside CALL ME MAESTRO and weakened the final furlong. CALL ME MAESTRO bobbled at the
break, saved ground around the turn while disputing the pace, drifted out entering the stretch and weakened. AMPERSAND dwelt at the break, trailed and
raced four wide on the turn. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the start but no action was taken.

Footnotes
WHIZWIT pulled his way forward to the inside of rivals near the five eighths, took over from PATRIOTIC PARTY a furlong later, spurted clear around the
turn, thwarted a challenge from PER DIEM entering the lane, kicked back clear while on his left lead and held sway under a drive. PER DIEM , patiently
rated close up and two wide behind rivals, advanced to the inside of a rival leaving the far turn, eased out and tracked two wide, ranged up outside the
winner approaching the stretch, could not match strides leaving the three sixteenths, remained on his left lead and continued willingly to be clear for the
place. PHRA PHROM , between runners while in range early, was shuffled back heading towards the half mile pole, angled out, circled five wide into the
lane and churned on. PRACTICAL SENSE , three wide between rivals forcing the early pace, lacked a punch past the five sixteenths and faded.
PATRIOTIC PARTY took over early and dropped down to about the two path, failed to resist a rail challenge from the winner nearing the half mile pole,
failed to go on leaving the three eighths and steadily retreated. NATAGAR broke slowly, was taken five wide and edged up outside foes nearing the five
eighths, lost ground four wide leaving the far turn, failed to respond past the three eighths and dropped back.

TINSELTOWN TINA , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, secured command in upper stretch then drew off under urging. MARIA FROM MIAMI
rushed up to press the early pace outside STORMIN' AMANDA, gained the lead on the turn and weakened the final furlong. LIL SPINNER , four deep on
the turn, drifted to the five path in upper stretch and failed to menace. PEACHESSWEETNOTION raced in the two path on the turn and flattened out
between horses in the stretch run. FIVECOMMATWO , along the inner rail around the turn, was no factor. STORMIN' AMANDA showed speed along the
inner rail to the stretch and gave way in mid stretch. HEARTSANDDIAMONDS trailed.

LITTLE MS SCARLET edged up between rivals nearing the five eighths to attend the pace, vied outside DULCE KIARA while under confident handling
around the turn, poked a head in front soon into the lane, responded when shaken up past the three sixteenths and eagerly pulled away while hand ridden.
WITTY BANTER lagged back early, took closer order under asking while saving ground past the three eighths, eased out in the drive, worked between
runners and gained the place. UNADULTERATED lost ground four wide outside rivals, was pushed along nearing the lane but failed to generate a
significant response. LADY MACHO , well placed tracking the embattled leaders while saving ground, eased out three wide under asking past the three
eighths, gave hard chase from there but needed more between runners. DULCE KIARA advanced inside foe leaving the chute and took command was
joined by the winner heading to the five eighths, sparred around the turn, ceded the lead into the lane, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded. IZZYBELLA
stalked early while three wide, raced between runners leaving the far turn, failed to kick on past the three eighths and gave way.

DOPPELGANGER stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide, gained command in upper stretch, drew clear under urging and drifted out inside the
sixteenth pole. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY showed speed, raced in the two to three path around the turn and faded in the drive. SHAFT'S BULLET , kept
outside horses throughout, was four wide on the turn, angled to the six path in upper stretch and lacked the necessary late response. ONE TEN raced in the
two path around the turn, swung to the six path in mid stretch and failed to be a factor. JALEN JOURNEY saved ground around the turn, was caught in tight
quarters along the inner rail in upper stretch and failed to be a threat. NAUTILUS raced near the inner rail while chasing the pace to the stretch then gave
way. WORKIN ON A DREAM set the pace slightly off the inner rail around the turn and gave way in upper stretch.

MR. HUSTLE settled back early off of contested pace while saving ground, edged up two wide within himself past the three eighths, shifted in a bit to
advance between runners in upper stretch, bid inside rivals to challenge leaving the eighth pole, dueled, wrested command from DIXIE DRAWL inside the
sixteenth marker and proved best under strong handling. DIXIE DRAWL , off the dueling leaders, gathered momentum mid turn, angled out and ranged up
five wide into the stretch, took command outside horses in mid stretch, battled gamely outside the winner but just wasn't good enough. LOCAL MOTIVE ,
perched three wide in hand tracking the duel, was given his cue nearing the lane, challenged four wide soon into the stretch, dueled between runners in mid
stretch, failed to go on with the top pair heading to the sixteenth pole and faded. PRAIRIE bobbled at the break, rushed up between rivals and bid to engage
near three quarter pole, dueled outside YES SIR ROBERT into and around the turn, held a slim lead near the quarter stayed on about a sixteenth longer
then faded. YES SIR ROBERT secured the inside early on, was joined for command three quarters out, sparred into and around the turn, was met by other
rivals in upper stretch and weakened. TREASURE TRADITION flashed speed and led early well off the rail, was firmly rated back off rivals to his inside near
the three quarter pole, dropped well back into the turn and failed to respond.

RESPONSE TIME chased the pace racing slightly off the rail on the turn, swung three wide approaching the stretch, swept to command in upper stretch,
was under urging and drew away. PRINCESS KOKACHIN saved ground around the turn while disputing the pace and weakened the final furlong.
CHEETARA (CHI) , steadied in traffic near the half mile pole, raced well off the rail there after and retreated through the stretch. WHISKEY AND RYE
disputed the pace outside PROINCESS KOKACHIN and gave way in mid stretch. PRAY FOR THE U S A , a forward factor along the inner rail early, gave
way. SHESALITTLE EDGY , wide around the turn, was not a factor.

Footnotes
THE HAUNTED ROOM rated close up while off the rail, moved up and engaged the leader from her outside after a half mile, dueled under asking from the
head of the lane, gained a slim lead past the three sixteenths, spurted clear a sixteenth out then held firm under strong encouragement. MUSICAL CAT ,
taken to rate while saving ground, edged up inside leaving the three sixteenths, eased out and finished gamely to steadily bridge the gap.
PERFORMANCEANXIETY , keen early, moved clear leaving the chute then dropped in to set the pace, was joined after a half mile, dueled with the winner
from the three eighths to mid stretch and faded late. SAPPHIRE BEAUTY had speed to the inside of runners leaving the chute then was rated back, stalked
inside, eased out three wide for the drive but went evenly in the final furlong. GWYNEDD , firmly rated three wide and advancing to the five eighths, stalked
the duel around the turn, shifted four wide for the drive and faded. RED WINE TIME hesitated at the break, settled off the pace and off the inside, drifted six
wide into the lane and came up empty.
