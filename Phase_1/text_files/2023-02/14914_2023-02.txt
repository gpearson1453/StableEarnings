Footnotes
GOTTA GO GATOR prompted the pace four wide around the first turn, chased two wide around the far turn, slowly gained inside of foes in the two path in
the lane, took the lead near the sixteenth pole and lasted. DONTKISSDAMINISTER broke inwardly, saved ground well back, advanced four wide around the
far turn, shifted widest in upper stretch, closed outside and just missed. DOC BALLARD was fractious in the gate, had his head turned at the start then
lunged, raced off the pace three and four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, rallied between foes and just missed. BLUE SOLDIER set the pace
along the rail, drifted out under left-handed urging in the lane and led until the sixteenth pole. MAKE 'EM TAP was unprepared for the start, chased the pace
five wide around the first turn, advanced three wide around the far turn, vied past the eighth pole and flattened out. PARADISE DRIVE bumped with
ANDYLITHIC at the start, raced two and three wide, continued on the left lead and never threatened. ANDYLITHIC was bumped at the start, pressed the
pace two wide and was through after a half. KICKSANDGIGGLES played no factor while racing two and three wide. KEYSER saved ground in range,
angled three wide near the quarter pole and came up empty. UWHARRIE was outrun while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
BLETCHLEY GIRL prompted the pace in the four path into the turn, was roused from the three path around the turn, floated out to the seven path entering
the lane, bid to the outside of the pacesetter passing the eighth pole, took the lead going into the final sixteenth, and drew clear. YOOOU KNOW set the
pace in the two path, was coaxed passing the quarter pole and opened up slightly into the stretch, and kept on but was caught by an outer rival inside the
final furlong to place. SUGAR SIN stalked in the three path, shifted inside around the turn, was short of room passing the five-sixteenths pole, received a
right handed cue along the rail entering the lane, but flattened out for show. LADY PETAL rated in the five path, fanned out to the seven path under a drive
going into the stretch, but was no factor. BULLET VALENTINA was coaxed along while off the pace inside, was ridden around the turn and tipped out to the
three path into the lane, but never threatened. GREY PRINCESS chased in the two path, shifted out around the turn and was in the six path going into the
stretch, angled in to the four path in upper stretch, but weakened. MAGIC CALL trailed throughout around the six path.

Footnotes
LOOKIN AT ROSES tracked in the six path, was roused from the five path around the turn and took aim in the six path entering the stretch, bid under left
handed urging nearing the eighth pole, took the lead, and drew clear while drifting in late. KING'S OVATION set the pace inside, was roused when headed
passing the three eighths pole, dug in from the three path into the lane, but yielded to the winner in the final furlong for place. SEPTEMBERTEN was behind
in seven path going into the turn, moved up and was coaxed from the six path around the turn, was in the eight path entering the stretch, and finished evenly
for show. WALL STREET TRADER raced prominently in the five path into the turn, bid in hand passing the three-eighths pole, was roused from the four
path into the lane, but faded. RED FLAG ALERT got brushed by an inner rival leaving the gate, chased in the four path but never threatened. AMERICAN
POWER was prompted along between foes in the three path going into the turn, but never menaced. BRACCIO DI FERRO broke out and brushed an outer
foe, was hustled along early while stalking in the two path but gaveway around the turn.

Footnotes
MARIANO settled off the pace while racing three wide, edged closer four wide around the far turn, closed between foes, took the lead near the sixteenth
pole and dug in inside a foe to narrowly prevail. LOVE MAMI LOVE was bumped not long after the start, steadied nearing the first turn, raced off the pace
two wide around that bend, angled five wide near the five-sixteenths pole, closed outside, reached near even terms outside of the winner near the sixteenth
pole but could not quite get by. CALLING ALL ANGELS (IRE) tracked the pace two wide, tipped three wide near the quarter pole, struck the front leaving the
eighth pole but could not hold off the top two in the final sixteenth. LIGHT AND PATH disputed the pace from the rail past the eighth pole then weakened.
MIRANDA'S ROCKY was pinched back not long after the start, raced well back three wide, angled widest in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. MO RISSA
disputed the pace in the three path and faded in the lane. MYSTIC SUNRISE chased the pace three wide around the first turn and two wide around the far
turn, angled to the rail for the stretch and lacked a path in the final sixteenth. KINDNESS IS FREE saved ground and failed to menace. WAND raced four
wide in midpack early, made a wide middle move down the backstretch and retreated around the far turn. AMANDA'S CHALLENGE was outrun inside.

Footnotes
MUSICAL DESIGN tracked in the four path, took aim from the five path and was coaxed entering the lane, bid into the final furlong under right handed
encouragement and drew away late to win. LIANA B set the pace in the three path, was roused while shifting inside turning into the lane, kept on but was
caught by the winner in the final furlong, and held on to place. SIENA LADY bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the three path,
shifted out to the five path and ranged up around the turn, was under right handed urging from the six path going into the stretch, and ran on for show.
MARILYN got bumped and squeezed between foes leaving the gate and trailed along the inside early, fanned out to the seven path under a ride going into
the lane, and improved position but was no factor. TIZ BIZNESS chased in the four path but was one paced from said position in the stretch. POGGIBONSI
prompted the pace in the two path but faded along the inside in the stretch. RITABOOK raced in midpack in the two path, was ridden in the three path
entering the lane, but flattened. STAKE A CLAIM bumped an inner foe at the start, was in range along the inside but had to steady going into the turn and
never threatened.

Footnotes
BEDTIME STORY tracked the pace in the two path, steadied when in tight near the quarter pole, swung five wide soon after, kicked in, seized command
near the sixteenth pole and quickly cleared. ONE OF ONE raced off the pace two wide, swung six wide turning for home, rallied widest and was up for the
place in the final strides. VAI BELLA tracked the pace three wide, bid in upper stretch but was outkicked. DAIZY DOOZY had her head turned at the start,
saved ground off the pace, tipped two wide in upper stretch, bid between foes but was outkicked in the final furlong. WHATCHAMACALL set the pace along
the rail and weakened through the final sixteenth. STRIKE JAK pressed the pace two wide and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
DR OSERAN bumped with an inner foe leaving the gate, set the pace in the two path, was cued right handed from said position entering the lane, opened
up and held sway. ROCKIN ROLLER stalked in the three path, was roused from said position turning into the stretch, and chased home the winner for
place. SHIP THE GOODS raced prominently in the two path, was coaxed while tipping out to the five path turning into the lane, and kept on under left
handed urging for show. TAKECAREOFBUSINESS prompted the pace along the inside, was cued from the two path into the stretch, but lacked a late kick
and finished evenly. SYNDICATED (GB) raced in midpack along the inside but was on heels and had to steady before the turn, shifted out to the six path
going into the stretch, but was one paced. MARLEY LUCK bumped with an outer foe leaving the gate, was held up in the two path, urged from the three
path into the lane, but flattened. CALL ME ICE MAN trailed in the two path early, was driven from the four path into the stretch, shifted back in to the two
path late but never threatened. MORETHANREADYEDDIE got squeezed at the start, tracked in the three path, was ridden from the six path into the stretch,
but was in traffic and never factored. TIGER PAW (IRE) had a slow start, rated in the three path, swung out to the seven path into the lane but never
menaced.

Footnotes
HARD COUNT set a pressured pace in the two path, kicked clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive. FAMOUS GENT stalked the pace four wide,
reached near even terms approaching the quarter, could not quite match strides with the winner in upper stretch but stayed on to gain the place.
INHALATION (GB) raced off the early pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn and had a mild rally to gain the show. LOYAL LOUIE tracked the
pace two wide between foes, was boxed in through much of the stretch and made little gain once clear in deep stretch. BACKWOODS BOOGIE went evenly
inside. UNIFIED CONQUEST was fractious in the gate, bumped at the start, raced well back inside, angled out in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals.
READTHETRANSCRIPT broke in and bumped UNIFIED CONQUEST at the start and played no further factor while saving ground. THE PREDICAMENT
pressed the pace three wide between foes and tired in the final furlong. OFFICER COUNTRY was outrun while racing two wide.
