MAZAL EIGHTEEN quickly took control, widened on the turn, drifted out and stayed safe through the stretch. GOD STILL LOVES ME lacked speed,
advanced in the two path on the turn and was up for the place late. CRAZY SERENA dropped back after the start, chased wide and finished willingly.
SEVEN YEARS LATER stumbled at the start, saved ground, bid into the stretch then flattened out. PEARLBDANCING raced in closest pursuit of the
pacesetter, moved wide on the turn and faded. DEBBIE'S SURPRISE raced off the leaders outside and gave way readily.

JARLIAN hustled to a clear advantage, controlled the slow fractions, drifted out in the stretch but held rival safe. ARTISTIC REASON stalked the winner
outside, loomed a stretch threat but could not get by. WEEKEND IN COURT trailed far behind then picked off rivals late along the inside. ACKER raced
wide off the leaders and went evenly through the stretch. RELISHMENT chased within striking range outside then proved empty in the stretch. MELINA'S
DREAM saved ground off the pace and gave way readily. CALL FITZROY lacked speed and was never in contention.

Footnotes
HE HATE ME dropped far behind, advanced near the inside and surged clear through the final sixteenth. SUIGU STAR lacked speed inside then closed well
late near the inside. TROPHY CHASER engaged in a heated duel outside, edged clear in midstretch, was collared again but continued gamely.
SNEAKINESS saved ground behind the dueling pacesetters, angled out in the stretch and weakened slightly. WE READY moved outside in the opening
quarter then moved very wide into the stretch. FEDERAL CASE raced outside in the second flight and flattened out in the stretch. FOX RED alternated for
the advantage inside then stopped after half a mile.

wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved up four wide on the far turn, rallied in the stretch, dug in and was outkicked. SOUTHERN BRIDGE stalked
two or three wide, chased three wide on the far turn, was steadied in tight at the quarter pole, then rallied mildly and got fourth. RUNNINGFORHOME raced
off the pace inside, moved up between rivals on the far turn and gained mildly inside. GRIT'N'GRIND was reluctant loading, outrun early, advanced inside
