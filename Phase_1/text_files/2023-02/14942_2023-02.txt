Footnotes
ADVANCE CASH was hard held early while up close in the three path, was roused to take the lead in the the two path passing the quarter pole, opened up
into the lane, began to shorten stride inside the final furlong, and just held on. VLADISLAV bumped with an outer foe after the start, rated in the four path,
tipped out approaching the quarter pole and was urged left handed from the eight path entering the stretch, and rallied down the center for place. CHEF
MENTEUR was in tight early and bumped with an inner foe into the first turn, raced in midpack between rivals in the four path, brushed with an inner foe just
before the half, was driven from the six path into the lane, drifted in passing the eighth pole, and kept on for show. BOARD CERTIFIED chased in the five
path, was brushed by an inner foe into the backstretch, was ridden around the far turn and in the seven path going into the stretch, and stayed on. WARP
SPEED BABY was unhurried in the three path, brushed with an outer foe early into the backstretch, was roused along the inside around the far turn, got
stymied passing the quarter pole, angled out to the four path into the lane, and finished evenly. IMPULSIVENESS trailed along the inside, floated out to the
seven path turning into the stretch, and was no factor. CHEERS FOR KITTEN raced prominently in the two path but flattened from the five path into the
stretch. EDEN PARADISE stalked in the four path, brushed with an outer foe into the backstretch, ranged up passing the quarter pole, but faded in the
stretch. QUANTUM THEORY broke out at the start but rushed up around the first turn to set the pace while shifting inside, held on to the lead before
yielding passing the quarter pole.

BELLA MIURA settled off the pace three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, seized command in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. KATZ
THAT GAL raced off the pace two wide, bid three wide around the far turn, took the lead near the quarter pole, was soon collared by the winner, could not
match strides with that foe but was clearly second best. KILKENNY BELLA saved ground in range, remained up close two wide between foes around the far
turn and lacked the needed stretch rally. LOVE UNLIMITED dueled two wide for six furlongs and faltered. ALWAYS CONNECTED dueled along the rail and
retreated around the far turn.

Footnotes
DEMURELY stalked the pace three wide, took over nearing the eighth and edged ahead under a drive. OAXACA had early speed inside, steadied nearing
the turn, chased inside around most of the bend, angled out near the quarter pole and rallied inside of foes in the two path in the lane. HEIR TO THE ROAR
hit the starting gate, advanced four wide around the turn and stayed on to gain the show. MAMA LONGLEGS threw her head at the start, trailed two wide,
swung five wide in upper stretch and had a mild rally. LENA THE LION set the pace two wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened.
BRODY'S CAUSEWAY bumped with DELTA RED at the start, chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. DELTA RED was bumped at the start,
raced in range two wide, steadied near the quarter pole, angled to the rail soon after and had no further response. INDIA PILAGA (ARG) was outrun while
racing three wide.

KING'S FORTUNE broke in at the start, raced in midpack along the inside, was roused between rivals around the far turn and angled out to the seven path
into the lane, and rallied while drifting in thru the final furlong to get up in the final sixteenth for the win. JUST SO tracked along the inside, was in hand from
said position while waiting for an opening around the far turn, was cued to bid in the two path entering the lane, ran on to take the lead into the final furlong
but was caught by a late surging outer foe to place. GIPSY CHIEF (GB) steadied at the start and was brushed by an outer foe, rated along the inside, was
ridden from the five path into the stretch, bumped with an outer foe near the eighth pole, and stayed on for show. MUTAAWID broke slow, raced wellback in
the four path, was under urging while fanning out to the ten path entering the stretch, and kept on down the center. SARA'S SHAMAN brushed with an inner
foe out of the gate, stalked in the two path, bid around the far turn and floated out to the five path into the lane, but bumped with an inner foe and evened out
in the final furlong. CARLIN CLAN was loose on the lead along the inside, was headed around the far turn and coaxed in the four path entering the lane, but
yielded passing the eighth pole. WINDSOR PARK tracked in the three path, was roused from the four path into the far turn, but flattened in the six path in
the stretch. GHOST COAST rated in the four path but faded in the stretch. LUCKY LUCKY LUKE trailed in the five path early and never threatened from the
nine path in the lane. JAMESTOWN broke out at the start, raced off the pace in the five path but was no factor while out in the eight path in the stretch.
CAPTAIN JACK raced in range from the three path but gaveway into the far turn and was eased into the stretch.

Footnotes
SHADOW SPHINX rated along the inside, steadied slightly nearing the half, was cued while tipping out to the seven path into the stretch, and rallied down
the center to get up inside the final sixteenth to win. RICHIESGOTGAME tracked in the four path, was coaxed while ranging up nearing the quarter pole, ran
on to bid going into the final furlong and briefly led but was caught by the late surging winner to place. LUCKY CURLIN stalked in the two path, was cued to
bid while floating out to the five path turning into the lane, kept on to take the lead into the final furlong but was caught by a pair of outer foes late to show.
COINAGE raced prominently along the inside, steadied and brushed an outer foe approaching the half, was roused from the three path into the lane, but
flattened. SAMBURU (GB) trailed in the three path, fanned out to the nine path under urging going into the stretch, but was no factor. RED DANGER
prompted the pace in the three path, was driven from the five path into the lane but faded. MAYA PRINCE set the pace in the two path, brushed with an
inner foe nearing the half, was roused from the three path entering the lane, but yielded.

Footnotes
TAPIT TRICE was off a bit slowly, angled four wide soon after the start, edged closer outside down the backstretch, cruised up three wide around the turn,
seized command near the quarter pole, vied outside of SHESTERKIN from there to midstretch then spurted clear while ridden out. SHESTERKIN prompted
the pace three wide down the backstretch, took the lead two wide early on the turn, led to the quarter pole, resisted inside of the winner to midstretch but
was overpowered through the final furlong. LIVE IS LIFE stumbled at the start, vied between foes down the backstretch, chased inside around most of the
turn, angled four wide near the quarter pole and churned on for the show. HARD TO HANDLE had early speed inside, chased in the two path around the
turn, angled five wide near the quarter pole and faded. EMPEROR'S APPEAL broke inwardly and brushed with MASTER OF NONE, raced off the pace two
wide and had no response. MASTER OF NONE was brushed at the start and trailed inside.

MAJOR DUDE tracked in the two path, ranged up around the far turn and was cued from the six path into the stretch, drifted out in upper stretch, and rallied
down the center to draw past a pair of inner foes in the final sixteenth. CANDIDATE stalked in the two path, was roused around the far turn and bid from the
four path into the lane, and kept on for place. DUDE N COLORADO (GB) bumped with an outer foe at the start, set the pace along the inside, was coaxed
passing the quarter pole and urged right handed in the three path at the top of the lane, and dug in before shortening stride in deep stretch to show. BOPPY
O prompted the pacesetter in the three path, was driven around the far turn and tipped inside entering the stretch, but yielded. SOUZAK (FR) trailed along
the inside, moved up from the rail around the far turn, angled out to the five path for the stretch, but evened out in the final furlong. CONGRUENT bumped
with an inner foe at the start, rated in the four path but was never a factor. LIGHTS OF BROADWAY raced in midpack from the four path but dropped back
around the far turn and never threatened. MOON CAT was wellback in the three path early and never menaced.

Footnotes
RED CARPET READY bobbled at the break, stalked the pace three wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, burst clear in upper stretch and held clear
while ridden out. UNDERVALUED ASSET tracked the pace four wide, bid nearing the quarter pole, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch but
stayed on willingly for the place. ATOMICALLY was off a bit slowly, raced in range three wide between foes, angled five wide in upper stretch and ran on for
the show. POSITANO SUNSET broke a bit awkwardly, raced off the pace four wide and passed tiring rivals. APROPOS failed to menace while racing three
wide. FLAKES saved ground off the pace, swung seven wide in upper stretch and was no threat. TWICE AS SWEET dueled inside for a half and retreated.
ARELLA STAR dueled two wide, stopped after a half and was eased through the lane. ADELIESE'S SMILE trailed inside.

Footnotes
CAIRO CONSORT threw her head at the start and broke outwards, trailed along the rail around the first turn and was in the four path down the backstretch,
was roused into the far turn, angled out to the six path under left handed urging into the lane, floated out to the seven path into the final furlong and rallied
down the center under right handed urging to get up in final strides. ALPHA BELLA raced prominently in the four path, took aim under a drive from the five
path into the stretch, ran on to take the lead inside the final furlong, but was caught by a late surging outer foe in final strides to finish with place honors.
HEAVENLY SUNDAY raced in midpack from the four path, ranged up from the five path turning into the lane, and kept on for show. METAPHYSICAL
brushed with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the two path, was coaxed from said position into the lane, and stayed on between foes. BULSARA was
unhurried in the three path, fanned out to the seven path into the stretch, but was no factor. MALLEYMOO brushed with an outer foe leaving the gate,
prompted the pace in the three path but yielded in the stretch. STEPHANIE'S CHARM rated in the five path, swung out to the nine path turning into the lane,
but never threatened. PADMA tracked in the two path, was driven from the three path into the stretch, but faded. SWEETLOU'SGOTACES set the pace
along the inside, was roused turning into the lane but gaveway passing the eighth pole.

Footnotes
ROCKET CAN settled in range while racing four wide, steadily gained four deep around the far turn, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, edged clear
turning for home and held safe under a steady drive. SHADOW DRAGON lacked early speed while racing in the two path, circled five wide around the far
turn, had aim outside of the winner turning for home, continued on the left lead in upper stretch, switched leads leaving the eighth pole and was slowly
gaining on the winner late. WEST COAST COWBOY stalked the pace from the rail, bid nearing the quarter pole, could not quite keep pace with the top two
in upper stretch but stayed on well to hold the show. LEGACY ISLE prompted the pace in the three path, took the lead near the three-eighths marker, was
collared near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. IL MIRACOLO was in tight three wide between through the opening
quarter-mile, raced off the pace three and four wide and never threatened. LORD MILES broke a bit awkwardly, saved ground off the pace, angled three
wide nearing the quarter pole and lacked a closing bid. CYCLONE MISCHIEF tracked the pace two wide between foes through the opening half, remained
up close three wide between rivals rounding the far turn, tipped out for clear sailing near the quarter pole and had no response. MR BOB set the pace in the
two path and retreated after six furlongs.
