Footnotes
RECONNECTING was bumped at the start, had her heels clipped behind not long after, raced off the pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far
turn, tipped out for clear sailing in upper stretch, kicked in and was up late. GREY PRINCESS was rank while racing three wide between foes, checked
midway around the first turn, launched a four wide bid around the far turn, struck the front leaving the eighth pole, drifted out under left-handed urging and
was caught in deep stretch. WAND was forced out nearing the first turn, angled in early on the bend, advanced three wide around the far turn, swung widest
in upper stretch, closed strongly, steadied late and just missed second. AMOR SALVAJE bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled five wide
near the quarter pole, was bumped in upper stretch then rallied. SEEKINGBYTHESTORM set the pace in the three path around the first turn and the two
path around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, led past the eighth and weakened. BULLET VALENTINA raced up close inside and faded
through the final furlong. OOPSIE DOOPSIE stalked the pace two and three wide and weakened. COLLECT A LIL clipped heels soon after the start, got out
and was checked entering the first turn, angled in soon after, saved ground well back, swung out turning for home, bumped AMOR SALVAJE in upper
stretch and improved position. KINDNESS IS FREE was unprepared for the start then bumped, chased the pace two wide around the first turn, and from the
rail around the far turn and lacked a closing bid. MERRY GOLD raced off the early pace four wide, made a three middle move but came up empty in the
lane. HEADING WEST broke inwardly and bumped the winner at the start, raced off the pace three and four wide and had no response. LADY BOURBON
played no factor while racing two and three wide. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY IN THE STRETCH RUN AND FOUND NO REASON TO
ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
ROSE E HOLIDAY trailed in the two path early and tipped in to the rail around the turn, was cued right handed approaching the quarter pole, rallied up the
rail in the stretch to take the lead in the final sixteenth and drew clear. AMERICAN OF COURSE set the pace in the two path, was roused nearing the
quarter pole and challenged by an outer foe while floating out to the three path into the lane, dug in to hold on to the lead into the final furlong but was
caught by a late surging inner foe nearing the sixteenth pole to place. SHES ALL WOMAN was prompted along in the three path and tipped out into the turn,
ranged up from the five path around the turn and bid at the top of the stretch, kept on going into the final furlong but drifted out nearing the sixteenth pole
and hung to show. SIMPLIFY (ARG) pressed the inner pacesetter in the four path into the turn, was urged left handed between rivals passing the quarter
pole and tipped out to the seven path into the stretch, and flattened. BATTLE CRY was coaxed along while in range in the five path early, lost ground in the
six path around the turn, and failed to threaten. SHEZA HAPPY GIRL stalked along the inside, was ridden in the two path around the turn, but failed to
menace from the five path in the stretch.

Footnotes
MARIA'S HONOR broke out at the start and rated in the two path, was roused around the far turn and angled out to the seven path in upper stretch, rallied
down the center under steady urging and got up on the wire to win. CRYSTAL COAST broke thru the gate prior to the start, stalked in the two path, was
cued while tipping out nearing the quarter pole and was out in the five path entering the stretch, ran on to bid passing the eighth pole and took the lead
under left handed urging to the wire, but was nailed by a late charging outer rival on the wire to finish with place honors. DONTMESSWITHTESS settled off
the pace in the three path, was ridden along the inside around the far turn and shifted out to the five path into the stretch, and kept on in the final furlong for
show. WICKED MERCURY was a bit fractious in the gate after an outer foe broke through, raced prominently in the three path early, was cued around the
far turn and tipped out to the four path into the stretch, bid passing the eighth pole, but was outrun in the final furlong. SANDPIPER MEMORIES tracked in
the four path, was coaxed around the far turn and floated out to the six path into the stretch, but was one paced. SWOONATRA set the pace in the two path,
was roused around the far turn, but yielded in the two path passing the eighth pole. SILVER MAGNATIZED broke out at the start and was wellback in the
four path, was cued right handed in the three path rounding the far turn, but failed to menace.

Footnotes
ROUGH ENTRY bobbled at the break, stalked the pace in the two path, angled four wide near the quarter pole, closed outside drew clear late. HE'S IN
CHARGE set the pace along the rail, was headed midway around the turn, regained command in upper stretch, drew clear nearing the eighth pole, could
not resist the winner but dug in to hold the place. GET SET settled off the early pace outside, moved up three wide around the turn, took the lead late on the
turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and held well enough to save the show. BOLDNESS failed to menace while racing four wide. LOUD MOUTH
pressed the two wide between foes, led near the three-eighths pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired. CREATE AGAIN was outrun inside.
WIND NINETY NINE lagged well back inside, swung out leaving the quarter pole and lacked a rally. TOUGH TO TAME played no factor while racing three
wide.

Footnotes
PEOPLE FORCE raced prominently in the three path, was cued in the two path around the far turn and bid passing the quarter pole, took a narrow lead in
the three path at the top of the stretch and drew clear under left handed encouragement in the final furlong for the win. MY FAVORITE TOPIC bumped with
an inner foe at the start, raced in midpack in the four path, was roused in the four path around the far turn and tipped out to the six path into the stretch, and
ran on under right handed urging for place. GUSTAVOR was steadied passing the wire the first time, tracked in the the three path, was roused in the four
path into the far turn and took aim from the five path into the stretch, and kept on to show. SOUPERSILVERDOLLAR got bumped on both sides at the start,
was in the three path around the first turn and raced wellback in the four path down the backstretch, was roused in the three path around the far turn and
angled out to the seven path entering the lane, and finished evenly. PEACH NECTAR set the pace in the two path, was coaxed along the inside around the
far turn, but yielded entering the final furlong. MR. AMERICAN bumped with an inner foe and an outer foe at the start, stalked in the two path, was coaxed
into the far turn, but flattened in the four path in the stretch. SOCIAL SIDEKICK had a hesitant and slow start and trailed around the three path into the far
turn, and was no factor from the five path in the stretch. DONTONIO was in the three path around the first turn and settled in midfield from the four path
down the backstretch, was under urging passing the quarter pole, and was empty in the stretch. CYCLONE RANGER bumped with an inner foe and then
brushed with an outer foe just after, rated in the six path, was in the four path around the far turn, but was no threat in the six path in the stretch. ETRETAT
bumped with an outer foe at the start, was unhurried along the inside of rivals but was never a menace.

firmly in hand in deep stretch. HIGH YIELD KITTEN raced well back two wide, swung widest in upper stretch and finished well to gain the place late.

Footnotes
FREEDOM MATTERS prompted the inner pacesetter in the three path, was in the two path around the far turn and cued to bid in the three path at the top of
the stretch, sustained that bid under right handed urging and drew past the inner pacesetter inside the final furlong to win. JAVA BUZZ set the pace along
the inside, was roused turning into the the lane, dug in from the two path into the final furlong, but yielded late to place. TIMMY M. trailed in the three path,
was ridden from the six path into the stretch, and ran on to get up for show in a photo. MARISA'S MISSION rated in the three path, was driven around the
far turn and in the four path entering the lane, and stayed on but was outrun by an outer foe late to miss minor placings. KING ALFREDO tracked from the
two path and was roused into the far turn, was in the five path at the top of the stretch, but flattened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MEHLEK was off a bit slowly, trailed in the two path, edged closer three wide around the far turn, fanned five wide near the quarter pole, kicked in under
mild urging, switch back to the left while drifting in a touch in midstretch and powered clear. MATEO set the pace in the two path, was headed around the far
turn, regained command in upper stretch, continued on the left lead, led past the eighth pole, was no match for the winner but held the place. PASAJERA
raced in range three and four wide and was along for the show. READY ON THE LINE prompted the pace in the three path, took the lead around the far
turn but tired in the lane. PLUMA ROJA settled off the early pace inside, made good progress between foes around the far turn but was empty in the lane.
PRUSSIAN BLUE chased the pace inside and faltered in the stretch.
