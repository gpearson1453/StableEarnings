Footnotes
BLUE CHIP BETTY Broke on top, cleared field and led on rail, ran in line of three around turn, confidently through lane. MY FUNNY GAL Moved between
from break, pressed leader opening stages, challenged at eighth pole two wide, shrugged off by winner. LOW DOSE Set up second flight outside, circled
four wide on bend, willingly late. SASSY EDIE Took hard contact early stages from #1 MOUNTAIN PASS, recovered to track along the rail, belatedly gained
inside while passing tiring foes. TRIPDOWNMEMORYLANE Was in touch three wide backstretch, three wide around turn, asked at quarter pole for run,
faded lane. MOUNTAIN PASS Shifted out at the break, sharply took off towards outer rail, first squeezed #2 WISHFUL WON out of spot, then initiated hard
contact with #3 SASSY EDIE, once clear of any other rivals that could be affected was hard to handle and ended up close to outer rail, re-engaged heading
into lane, minor headway late. WISHFUL WON Shuffled out sharply between horses shortly after the start, lagged from that point, did not impact. AN
OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF #2 WISHFUL WON WAS LODGED AGAINST #1 MOUNTAIN PASS AND #3 SASSY EDIE REGARDING A
BACKSTRETCH INCIDENT. AFTER REVIEW, STEWARDS DETERMINED #1 MOUNTAIN PASS IMPACTED THE PLACING OF #2 WISHFUL WON. #1
MOUNTAIN PASS WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SIXTH TO SEVENTH.

eighth pole, won battle, drew off convincingly. MADISON'S QUARTERS Tracked well off a hot pace on the rail, advanced at the quarter pole while
remaining inside, passed tiring rival late for place honors. MISS AGGIE BLING Dueled at a dogged pace outside of rival, was unable to keep pace when the
running got real, faded down the lane. ORATORY GLORY Set up well off the speed in the three path, asked at quarter pole, never menaced. IZANAMI
Taken back early, called upon heading into bend, never fired.

Footnotes
MINEHUNTER Made the lead with ease, remained unchallenged while responding to rider's every cue, called upon at the eighth pole to stay in command,
coasted home. GONE SOMEWHERE Stalked between rivals just off the leader, asked at quarter pole to proceed, two wide bid around the far turn, no
match for lone leader. FULL DRAW Brushed inside from the break, made move to the rail in approach to the first turn, sat in pocket behind leader and inside
of two stalking rivals, made move at three-sixteenths pole, outfinished while moving to wire on the wrong lead. FINAL ROSE Tracked well off the pace
throughout, commenced a move beginning in the five path around the far turn, showed mild late gain to the wire. HULA KING Stalked three wide in first turn
run, maintained position until far turn, outpaced when three fellow top flight runners made moves, could not advance down the lane. OUTLAW BY NATURE
Missed the break, lagged far behind and was far from in touch with the field, passed one tiring rival down the lane. AUTISM SAVANT Settled off the pace
inside of rivals, in the run to the first turn shifted well out to the five path for clear air, failed to improve from that point, faded from the quarter pole to the wire.
