Footnotes
EL CHAVO DEL OCHO was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, responded when set down for the drive and was up in the
closing yards. CAUSE AND EFFECT was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and finished with good energy. WICKED BLUE lacked early
foot, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with a late bid. WHOS DALLINS DADDY set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way through the
final sixteenth. ZATTER pressed the pace while racing four-wide and gave way in the drive. READY TO FORGIVE pressed the pace while racing three-wide
and gave way through the final furlong. NEVADAN was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. KING LEBRON lacked
early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MISS GHISLAINE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached PINK CHANNEL with a furlong to run, vied
with that rival and edged away late. PINK CHANNEL stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths marker,
responded when challenged by the winner in mid-stretch, vied with that foe but could not match strides in the closing yards. WALK SOFTLY was reserved
just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the lane and finished with a steady bid. AKASI lacked early
speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly late. COME CORRECT settled off the leaders early, moved
five-wide through the second turn and failed to gain late. HELLO BABY raced off the leaders throughout and did not reach contention. POETIC PURSUIT
sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, weakened after going three-quarters and was eased through the lane. UPTOWN RHAPSODY
lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and was eased through the lane. WEGOTTODRINKING raced five-wide through the first turn,
lagged far back and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
BIG JACK was away in good order to duel for the lead from between foes, re-bid with a furlong to run, vied with CARRIZO SPRINGS and edged away late.
CARRIZO SPRINGS pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear margin approaching
the stretch, responded when challenged in mid-stretch by the winner but could not match strides in the final yards. BARON'S SONG was reserved just off
the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. IMA CARPE DIEM was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the
turn, angled out further nearing the sixteenth pole and finished evenly. NORTHERN COCKTAIL showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and
was not a factor. BRENSON BUNS disputed the pace from the inside for a half and weakened.

Footnotes
JUST PICK IT UP dueled for the lead from the inside with BUMPY CUP, disposed of that rival after going a half, quickly opened a clear margin and was
ridden out to the wire. BUMPY CUP dueled for the lead with the winner while racing four-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but held well to save
the place. A GEM IS A GEM was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. ROUGE SUNSET lacked early
speed, saved ground through the turn and finished with some late run. LIVE A GOOD LIFE was off a step slow, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through
the turn and finished with a belated bid. TENACIOUS LION settled off the leaders early, moved seven-wide through the turn and was not a factor. OUR
EMPIRE raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. PROFOUND ONE raced off the pacesetters early, moved
three-wide through the turn and weakened. MARK OF VALOR was off a step slow, lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace.
STYLISH ELEGANCE chased the leaders while racing five-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
GRAVES MILL ROAD was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up to offer a bid from between foes nearing the half, vied with THE BEAT and proved
best in the closing yards. THE BEAT dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run, responded when challenged
by the winner but could not resist that rival late. ATOMIC CANDY pressed the pace while racing five-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the sixteenth pole
and finished willingly. SOCAL RED showed no early speed, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with a late bid. THE GREEN CRUSADER raced five-wide
through the first turn, raced just off the leaders early, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths marker and gave way in the drive. LOLLY
EXPRESS was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. BARBARIAN disputed the pace while racing three-wide,
checked nearing the half and weakened thereafter. LINCHTOWN raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened.
POPS AWESOME lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not offer a bid.
