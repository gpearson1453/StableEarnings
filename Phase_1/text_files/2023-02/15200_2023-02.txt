Footnotes
BRODY SLAM close up between foes, vied from the far turn to midstretch and edged ahead in a steady drive. SUGAR STREAK fanned six wide on first
turn, remained wide, led to midstretch but was outfinished. JUST STAY HOME settled off the leaders inside, angled out in the stretch with a mild bid.
JULIET'S MUSIC broke a step slowly, moved up inside, vied on the final turn and weakened. SPEIGHTSTER'S GOLD hustled to a clear advantage for half
a mile and faded on the final turn. MARIANNA QUEEN lacked speed chasing wide and was never a factor. LIL MISS HOTSHOT raced close up three wide
and stopped after half a mile.

apart with AMATERASU, gained command in midstretch, then dug in gamely late to prevail. AMATERASU vied inside for the lead, dueled on the backside,
shook free on the far turn, dueled two wide into the stretch, dug in gamely outside of the winner and battled on determinedly to the end.
WHYISSHESOOLUCKY trailed the field, advanced inside on the far turn, closed mildly and earned the show spot. MINDING MILLIE broke in bumping a
rival at the start, stalked close up three wide, bid three wide on the far turn, then chased and weakened. SEAMIALAUGH was bumped at the start and
steadied, raced off the pace inside and did not factor. NOT A TRACE vied two wide for the lead, dueled on the backside, gave way on the far turn and
stopped. SUMMARY JUDGMENT raced two wide off the pace, gave way and stopped in the stretch.

collared by the winner in the stretch and finished gamely. RUDY ROD lagged far behind, advanced wide in the stretch with late energy while no menace.
LAZARETTO angled inside down the backstretch and continued willingly while no threat. GOLDEN SPOKE trailed to the stretch then passed rivals while no
menace. REJECTED AGAIN urged close up inside, was placed in tight near the far turn and faded in the stretch. SHACKLE CAT forced the pace three wide
to the stretch and faltered. STREET TAIL flashed speed between rivals then began stopping on the turn.

NIMBLE BEAST set the pace racing with a clear lead, responded when roused, edged away and held well under urging. LITTLE HARBOUR chased close
up on the inside, chased on the turn, dug in gamely in the stretch drive and prevailed for the place spot. JOHNNY RITT chased between rivals, chased on
the turn, dueled between rivals in the stretch run and was outfinished for second. SOUPER FLY OVER was outrun early, advanced inside at the quarter
pole and rallied mildly on the rail. DALTON chased three wide, chased on the turn, dueled to midstretch and weakened. CHAIN REACTION bobbled at the
break, raced off the pace and did not factor.

Footnotes
CASTILLEJA settled in hand just off the pace, surged to the front inside on the turn and quickly drew away while ridden out. SPANIKOPITA dropped well
behind then advanced inside to get up for the place. I CROSS MY HEART lacked speed, moved briefly closer on the turn then rallied mildly. PONTIFFANY
hustled to a narrow advantage inside then weakened in the stretch. CHRONOLOGY stalked the dueling pacesetters three wide then faltered. SNOW
FORECAST forced the pace outside for half a mile and gave way. J D'S VISTA trailed early, advanced six wide on the turn then flattened out.

Footnotes
PRACTICAL WAY stalked outside a rival, chased on the turn, rallied three wide into the lane, dug in gamely outside of MAGICNTHEMOONLIGHT, dueled
with that rival in the final sixteenth and edged away late. MAGICNTHEMOONLIGHT bobbled a bit at the break, dueled two wide for command, dueled with
DIESEL on the turn, led into the stretch, then battled heads apart with the winner and dug in gamely on the rail to the end. HE'S INCREDIBLE stalked the
pace, chased on the turn, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied mildly outside and got the nod for the show spot. MIDLANER trailed the field, advanced at
the quarter pole, closed late inside and just missed for third. RICH'S WAY raced off the pace and did not factor. DIESEL dueled inside for the lead, dueled
on the turn and weakened in the final furlong. STRONG BREEZE chased on the inside and tired.

Footnotes
BELLA MARIA set the early pace, then dueled two wide, shook free on the turn, kicked clear turning for home and held well under urging. ROSE LEGACY
stalked the pace racing close up, chased two wide on the turn, rallied outside in the stretch drive and came up second best. SWEETER stalked close up
outside early on, chased three wide on the turn, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly to get third. FRIEDER FANATIC raced off the early pace, then
moved up on the rail into contention, dueled inside of the winner, chased on the turn and weakened on the rail in the stretch. SAY NO MORE stalked two
wide, then inside, chased on the turn, raced between rivals at the furlong marker and lacked a rally. NANA'S BOOPA stalked three wide, chased on the turn,
came four wide into the lane and had no rally. MISBEHAVING LADY broke a bit awkwardly and was steadied, then raced off the rail, off the pace and did
not factor. SO SWELL raced off the pace inside and was outrun.
