Footnotes
REALITOS broke out and was corrected quickly, moved up to take the lead, set a relaxed pace from the rail, was challenged by another foe at the quarter
pole, repelled that foe and drew off for the easy win. MYLIES STAR broke outward and was straightened up quickly, settled mid pack in company with
another foe, moved up around the three eighths pole, shifted out down the lane and closed really well, was able to pass rivals and obtain the place spot.
DEBS PRAYER traveled on the outside several lengths off the leader, was in contention in the turn, asked at the quarter pole, closed well but wasn't enough
to catch the leader today. B B GUN BULLSEYE traveled into the first turn on the lead with another foe from the three path, rated just off the leader until the
half, started to challenge for the lead in the turn, was matching stride for the lead coming out of the turn, faltered in the lane. GUANAJUATO was along the
rail in the first turn, was brought out three wide down the back side, was shifted five wide in the lane but stopped. ZEEROCK off slow and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MALIBU S S took contact from rivals on both sides at the start, stalked outside of the clear leader and from the three to two path into the turn, pressed
around the bend, gained an advantage leaving the quarter pole, battled through midstretch, and drove clear nearing the final sixteenth. KENNESAW came
in at the start, narrowly avoided bumping an inner rival while clearing in the process, showed the way from an outer prompting foe around the turn, got
headed at the quarter pole, fought on into deep stretch, but yielded at the sixteenth pole. CRIME SPREE was bumped by rivals on both sides at the start,
tracked the top pair from the three path while between horses into the turn, ranged up to take aim on the leaders entering the lane, but lacked a bid,
flattened out late, and saved show from an outer rival. TANGO CHARLIE bumped an outer rival at the start, saved ground off of the pace, chased behind
foes in upper stretch, shifted ground outside of rivals in the final furlong, and stayed on to miss reaching show. HOORAY AUSTIN shied mildly from a
quicker-breaking outer rival at the start, but bumped an inner foe in the process, tracked in the five path, chased the four path and outside of rivals around
the turn, and faded. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE START RESULTED IN NO CHANGE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
CARTIER CAT tracked from midpack along the inside, pursued from the pocket in the two path behind the leaders around the far turn, inched closer
between horses entering the lane, produced a bid inside of the leader at the three sixteenths pole, led entering the final furlong, and held from an outer
chaser. GOLDEN PEGASUS took a bump from an inner rival at the start, tracked in midpack three wide, was urged to inch closer in the four path around the
far turn, came into the lane within striking distance, but was subtly outkicked by an inner rival in upper stretch, chased that foe home well through the final
furlong, vied nearing the wire, but missed. DUKE OF BLUE RIDGE leaned out and bumped an outer rival at the start, prompted the pace along the inside,
backed off and shifted out to stalk outside of the leader entering the backstretch, tugged while well in the bit before bidding entering the far turn, led in the
three path at the three furlong pole, but was outkicked by an inner rival in upper stretch, and yielded between horses in the final furlong. STOCKPILER
trailed two wide, took the far turn in the five path before fanning into the lane in the seven path, and stayed on willingly. LIONS NOT SHEEP stalked two to
three wide around the first turn, but faded between horses approaching the three furlong pole, got floated to the six path while between horses at the quarter
pole, and yet came again, but failed to reach contention. MAGAZINE STREET was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, lacked speed two
wide, saved ground around the far turn, shifted five wide in upper stretch, but lacked a rally between horses. ENDLESS SUNSET saved ground far back, but
to no avail. UNCLE NICK set the pace in the two path, but was headed by an outer rival at the three furlong pole, and weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
RALLY BOARD broke the fastest, was allowed to find his stride early, rated off the leader, moved before the three eighths pole, was in control within a few
strides, went to work at the quarter pole and dominated this field. WOLF HUNTER settled off the pace early, found his stride and starting moving up from the
two path, was fully engaged by the half and split horses, continued to gain momentum into the turn while saving ground, was in full pursuit of the leaders at
the quarter pole, shifted out late to pass another rival and was up for place. KNOCK'EM OUT JERRY took the rail trip, set the pace, was challenged at the
three eighths pole, struggled to switch leads and flattened out. COTE D'IVOIRE settled off of the pace from the four path, was brought down the lane from
the outside, improved past an inner rival in the final furlong, but failed to catch an outer foe for fourth. CAMP GRAY settled into the second tier in the three
path down the back side, was asked to rally, from the outside in the turn, made some head way but not enough to catch the leaders and tired in the lane.
FOE settled into the mid pack, was in company down the backside from the inside for a quarter of a mile, remained near the back of the field along the rail,
and ran flat. LUCKY'S LANE was never involved.

Footnotes
ROSE PALACE set the pace along the inside, and held sway from an outer pursuer through the lane under driving pressure. BRAGANZA tracked three
wide, gained place from inner rivals into the turn, stalked the leader turning for home, and chased that foe home well while being fended off and proving
second best. SIKUM laid off of the pace two to three wide, shifted out four wide in upper stretch, and ran on while one paced. PRECURSORY chased two
wide and between horses into the turn, but gave way turning for home, and lacked a rally thereafter. MAKEMEBELIEVE stalked along the inside chased into
the turn, but was shuffled back behind a tiring rival at approaching the lane, and failed to factor. CAVE CREEK trailed throughout after taking the turn in the
four to five paths.

Footnotes
MISS TAPPY TONE was allowed to find her stride from the back of the field, she was in no hurry, made up some ground by the three eighths pole while still
being well off the leaders, swung wide out of the turn and was set down for the drive, where she steadily made up ground and clipped off rivals inch by inch,
was able to out finished the rest. DIALHERUP was allowed to settle far off the pace early, was asked to move at the half mile marker, responded by gaining
ground and passing a rival on the outside, was wide out of the turn in the lane where she continued to close passing other rivals, could see the wire and was
collared by a challenging rival on the outside, matched strides with rival for a little bit farther and tired late. MYSTIC CREED broke sharp, easily took the
lead from the five path, gently shifted down into the two path while she controlled the pace, was the leader until just after the quarter pole, was caught by an
outer foe, matched strides with this rival, shook her looked a winner but was caught late. MARGOINABUBBLEBATH was off the pace while matching stride
with another rival from the outside, continued to gain ground as a set through the turn, shifted out a bit at the quarter pole, collared the early leader and
battled with this foe until deep in the furlong ground where she tired. CINCO DE CUATRO was just off the pace in the second tier from the inside early,
hooked company along the backside and through the turn while saving ground, right after the quarter pole had to angle out to move around early leader and
faded. WAIT ON ME chased throughout and passed a tired rival in the stretch. OLDFIELDS was mid pack along the inside, was holding the same place
through the turn, started a steady retreat after the quarter pole.

REGAL KINGDOM trailed along the inside, shifted outside of foes in the backstretch, rallied five wide into the far turn to bid outside of the leading trio and
from the fie path leaving the three furlong pole, gained an advantage nearing the lane, drew clear entering it, and held sway from a group of chasers on both
sides through the final furlong. AMERICAN DOLLARS tracked along the inside, but lost a few lengths worth of position once shuffled behind a tiring rival
turning for home, shifted out three wide and between horses in upper stretch, stayed on to attempt a bid inside of the leader in the final furlong, but was kept
at by, and prevailed for place. SLICK AND FAST broke awkwardly while off a step slow, saved ground off of the pace, retreated to trail at the half mile pole,
shifted off of the fence turning for home, then to the seven path in upper stretch, then chased evenly outside of the leader, and missed reaching place.
SONYA KNOWS BETTER laid off of the pace in the three to four paths while between horses, tracked while tipping to the four path around the far turn, then
chased between horses while aiming inside of the clear leader, and yielded late. WISHERT dueled for the lead along the inside, got headed while inside of a
trio of foes at the three furlong pole, took a bump from an outer rival at the five sixteenths pole, and gave way in upper stretch. UP N GONE bumped with an
outer rival at the start, chased three wide, bid under heavy urging into the far turn as an outer rival forced his hand, bumped an inner rival turning for home
before getting headed by a his outer bidding counterpart, and weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. JOEY'S GAME hopped and bumped with
an inner rival at the start, lacked speed in the four path, got floated to the six path at the five sixteenths pole, and made little impact. SIKARA SIKARA
dueled for the lead two wide, then from between horses into the far turn as outer rivals produced bids, but was bumped by an outer counterpart into an inner
rival turning for home, and weakened shortly after.

Footnotes
EASY RUNNER stalked two wide and between horses, bid around the turn, dueled with an inner rival while wrestling an advantage in upper stretch, and
drew clear at the sixteenth pole. CHARLIE'S TOWN broke inwardly, yet clear of inner rivals, set a clear pace, met a pair of outer challenges around the turn,
got headed by his most immediate rival in upper stretch, fought on well into the final furlong, but yielded a sixteenth from home. BIG SCULLY stalked three
wide, bid around the turn, but weakened in upper stretch, and saved show from inner rivals alte. MR ELVIN laid off of the pace in the four path, stayed on to
bid for show inside of that place-holder along with an inner rival in the closing stages, but was denied. SARAH'S VISION saved ground while trailing, and
stayed on inside of rivals to bid for show late, but came up short. FOOLISH DREAMS pursued from midpack in the two path, and failed to factor between
horses. TOTALLY ADDICTED lacked speed in the three path and between horses, and tired late.
