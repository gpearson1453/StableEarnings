Footnotes
MOBOU stalked the pace from inside, moved off the rail on the far turn and took aim two wide into the stretch, steered out further in upper stretch, rallied
four deep and got up in the closing moments. SHORTMAN bumped with inner rival early, steered to the inside and settled off the pace, saved ground
around the second turn, moved out in the lane, rallied between rivals in the final sixteenth and missed. ATOMIC DROP was antsy in the starting gate,
forwardly placed on the inside then switch off the rail on the first turn, was closest in pursuit to the far turn, engaged the leader from the two path, dueled into
the lane, took over in upper stretch, challenged by outside runners in the final sixteenth, lost whip late and was overtaken. TOM'S X S dropped his head at
the start and came away last, rushed up to gain control and crossed over to the inside, set the pace to the far turn, pressured around that bend, maintained
a short lead in to the drive, lost command in upper stretch, stayed on into deep stretch then flattened late. MISCHIEVOUS PATH tracked three deep then
outside a rival on the backstretch, took aim three wide into the lane and lacked a bid. CIBERTRUCK stalked between early then three wide into the
backstretch, rounded the far turn two wide and weakened. BOTTLE OF SMOKE bobbled sharply at the start, bumped with outer rivals soon after then had
to take up along the rail prior to the first turn, lagged behind three to four wide and never made an impact.

Footnotes
LIBERAL LADY sped clear and set the pace near the inside, held a comfortable lead through the turn, led a bit off the rail into the stretch, then drew off
under right handed urging in the final furlong. TENNESSEE MOON stalked the pace inside a pair of rivals, tipped out around the turn and took aim at the
leader two to three wide entering the stretch but was no match in the final furlong. ANYBODY'S CHOICE stalked three deep into the turn, asked three wide
entering the stretch, could not summon the needed response but churned on to hold the show. FILTHY FAST climbed a bit early in the chute, steered out
wide early, chased four wide around the bend and failed to respond. LOANA chased between rivals to the turn, lost ground around the bend in the two path
and faded. WIRLY GIRLY bobbled leaving the gate, trailed on the inside around the turn and was not persevered with in the stretch.

Footnotes
SANGRE AZUL dueled for command from outside, fought from the two path through the far turn, battled down the lane and dug in late to best the runner-up.
FLATTERWITHJEWELS dueled inside SANGRE AZUL, inched ahead into the far turn, carried a short lead into the final sixteenth and yielded late while
clearly second best. CALIFORNIA GIGI chased two to three wide into the first turn, raced along the rail into the far turn, exited that bend two wide, moved
out in the lane, could not make any headway on the top pair but churned on for a clear third. A BROKEN BREEZE tracked five then four wide outside rivals
early, continued four wide through the far turn and weakened. SACRED BEAUTY tracked three to four wide between rivals early on, lost ground around the
far turn, trailed two wide into the stretch and weakened. SHVERE ARBETER broke a step slow, chased four wide into the first turn then tugged the rider
along and went outside the top pair, remained close up to the three-eighths pole, lost ground past the quarter pole, angled in at the top of the stretch and
faded.

Footnotes
TERRIER broke a step slow on the outside, settled off the pace then moved into range up the backstretch, coaxed along two wide then ran up behind the
top trio and had pause at the five-sixteenths pole, tipped out and challenged four wide into the stretch, took over outside the eighth pole and held over RAJI
in the final strides. RAJI brushed leaving the gate, raced on the inside in mid-pack into the turn, saved ground to the lane, angled out in upper stretch and
closed well from outside but ran out of time. SEISMIC SPIRIT (IRE) dueled for the lead early then ceded command, challenged three deep into the turn, vied
outside rivals around the bend, led into the stretch but was soon overtaken by TERRIER and stayed on from inside to hold the show. SIPPIN WHISKEY was
off slow to begin, climbed over the dirt, went two to three wide around the bend and earned a minor award. DONTTESTYOURLUCK was off a bit slow,
traveled along the inside near the back, steered out in the lane and improved position. EDDIE CROSSWIRE brushed leaving the gate, chased early then
angled in and went up to engage the leader from inside, bumped with that rival twice while taking over with three-furlongs remaining, vied with rivals around
the turn and lost command into the stretch, then weakened in the final furlong. MONGOLIAN SKY dueled from inside early then cleared, challenged from
inside leaving the backstretch and bumped twice into the turn, lost command and fought between rivals around the bend, then gave way in the stretch.
VORTEX was off slow in the beginning, trailed on the inside into the stretch and was not a factor.

MITICO set the pace inside rivals then moved clear, challenged from outside around the turn, cleared again in upper stretch and held well when challenged
by QUICK INTRO again late. QUICK INTRO forwardly placed three deep then chased outside a rival into the turn, bid outside the leader around the turn,
lost touch into the stretch, came again in the final sixteenth but lacked the needed late punch. KANT BEAT THE ROCK tracked off the rail, three deep at the
quarter pole, offered a mild response in the lane and whittle the gap while gaining third. FIREMAN DAN stalked the pace on the inside, got blocked from the
three-eighths to the five-sixteenths pole, cut the corner into the lane and lacked a bid. CRYPTO MUNNY chased two wide into the turn, angled out around
the bend, entered the lane four wide and failed to rally. SEATTLE BREAKOUT raced up close between rivals then chased the lone leader from inside into
the turn, lost ground in the two path around the bend and weakened. HOOP DREAM got crowded between rivals early, trailed three wide into the turn,
entered the lane four to five wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
UNWRITTEN CODE sped clear and steered to the inside, controlled the pace to the stretch, kicked clear in upper stretch and widened when roused and
shown the whip. LA DEUXIEME ETOILE was closet in pursuit from outside early, chased two wide then along the rail into the stretch, could not threaten the
winner in the lane but stayed on t best the rest. FEELING GRAZEFUL stalked the pace on the inside, moved off the rail and could not find room behind
rivals in upper stretch, angled to the inside and was along for the show. GLORIOUS SPRING broke slow on the inside, raced off the pace, went two wide
into the lane, got put in tight briefly at the three-sixteenths pole and kept on to earn a minor award. SHEZA GIRLY GIRL bumped leaving the gate, raced off
the pace in the early going, traveled three deep on the turn then four wide into the stretch and flattened. SHANGHAI SUNRISE raced in range up the
backstretch, tracked three then two wide around the turn and weakened. SMILING MOLLY broke a step slow, had to check behind a rival at the half-mile
pole then took hold again approaching the seven-sixteenths marker, spun three wide into the lane and weakened. STARSHIP SKY bumped with outer rival
at the start, dropped back to last, went four wide around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
FOOTHILL got knocked into inner rival at the start, reserved three wide early, angled inward and moved closer in the middle stages, waited for room in the
two path on the far turn, roused into the stretch, tipped outside the top pair and drove clear. MAMBA COOL unhurried on the inside early, went outside a
rival then between foes on the backstretch, pushed on two wide through the second bend, tipped out in upper stretch and gained second. GIVE ME THE
LUTE cleared early and angled over to the rail, took pressure from outside in the middle stages, dueled around the far turn, maintained a slim advantage
into the lane, lost command past the eighth pole and saved the show. SO I'M TOLD broke in and bumped rival, was keen between rivals nearing the first
turn, went up to apply pressure on the backstretch, fought on even terms through the far turn and into the stretch, battled into the furlong grounds, then
flattened in the final sixteenth. CLAYTON DELANEY was off a bit slow, bumped with the winner early, tucked inside for the first turn, roused with a quarter
mile left to run, put to the stick at the top of the stretch, moved out in the lane and kept on to improve. FORE FLAG forwardly placed three deep early,
stalked outside a rival then dropped back approaching the far turn, angled to the inside around the far turn and passed tired rivals in the lane.
BEAUDACIOUS bumped leaving the gate, tracked two wide early on, outside a rival into the second bend, came five wide into the stretch and had little left
for the drive. MOOSE MITCHELL forwardly placed four deep into the first turn then moved into the three path, rated outside the top pair up the backstretch,
ridden along through the second turn, spun four wide into the drive and weakened.
