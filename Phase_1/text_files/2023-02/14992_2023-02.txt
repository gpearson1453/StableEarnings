KATY THE CAT was reserved early, advanced three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and closed well to get up late to prove best, driving.
TERPEYE was outrun early, came three wide into the lane, angled out by the furlong marker and closed the gap fast on the outside. MELODIOUS SINGER
prompted the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid leaving the turn to take command and was clear by the furlong marker, then failed to last late and
lost the place award as well. ROSES FROM HEAVEN was settled early, four wide on the turn and came six wide into the lane and had a late rally but
needed more. POSITIVE FORCE rushed up on the inside to vie for command by the half mile marker, then rated back on the turn, swung out five wide
leaving the turn and faded. SOUTH HOUSE pressed the pace three wide early, made a bide to vie for command between rivals on the turn, shifted out
leaving the turn and was empty. SUSIKIN vied for the lead two wide and in between rivals by the half mile marker, then was inside the trio on the turn, and

C C'S KINGDOM set the pace along the inside, was well handled and drew out leaving the turn, then was given a right handed reminder by the sixteenth
marker and then ridden out to the wire to prove much the best. RUNYONESQUE was five wide into the first turn, rated along and made a four wide move on
the turn, could not go with the winner in the lane while being clearly second best. TUCKERTON BAY stalked the winner early, between rivals at the half mile
marker, then shuffled back on the turn, shifted out and came five wide into the lane and was along for the show award. DATHOSS was rated early, made a
middle move on the inside on the backstretch, but weakened in the lane and lost the show award. SOUL STORY lacked a rally. FACTOTUM stalked the
pace four to three wide and tired. BOKERMIN failed to menace.

FIVEALARM FREAKOUT was away alertly to set the paced in the two path, then was in the three path midway on the turn while clear, came three wide into
the lane and drew off on the left lead, and then was ridden out and shown the crop to wire to prove much the best. FAIRVIEW hopped at the start, then
steadied around the five eighths marker, saved ground on the turn and rallied well for the place award, no match to the winner. FINISHING TOUCH rushed
up the inside to stalk the winner by the half mile marker, then shifted out on the turn and swung out four wide leaving the turn and was empty, held show.
OUTSPEND broke outwardly at the start, stalked the pace three wide and weaklened. APRILS LUCK chased the pace four wide and weakened.

VIOLENT PASS was well placed on the inside, made a inside bid leaving the turn, then slowly edged away to prove best under a drive. DREAMERS
REWARD set the pace while in the two path, dug in in the lane but could not hold off the winner, second best. SASSY LAD stumbled at the start, settled and
was four wide on the turn, came six wide into the lane and had a late rally. TIZ HANDSOME pressed the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but
faded in the drive. THE LITTLE SPROUT was settled early, saved ground on the turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn, then was bumped hard and
sideways by the furlong marker and finished evenly. CALLYOURIGHTBACK passed the tiring rivals. SINGLINO was reserved between rivals on the turn
and had no rally. KAZTHAROS chased the pace four wide, then lugged in by the furlong marker and weakened. EASY STRIDE failed to menace. SPEED
SLOT showed little.
