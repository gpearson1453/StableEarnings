Footnotes
ONE MORE LAUGH was out the fastest, showed the rest of the field the way, drifted out into the five path around the five sixteenth pole and even more to
the seven path at the three sixteenth pole, was gently corrected and finished strong besting the rest of the field. CHROME RACER brushed out a but at the
start, tried to match strides with the leader early on, settled for second tier in between horses down the backside, hooked with other foe in the turn battled
down the lane and out lasted the others while securing second. SHE'S MY LOUIE V. hopped at start, raced in the second tier from the inside, had aim on
the leader through the turn, hooked another foe down the lane, battled with that foe for the place spot, but didn't have enough and was able to show .
ZIGGZAPPA settled early, was moved out from behind horses down the back side, saved ground through the turn was asked down the lane but didn't have
enough. SUNDAY HOUSE was placed in the second tier down the backside, showed brief run moving into the turn, flattened out coming out of the turn,
came down the lane and and switched leads back and forth with no finish.

Footnotes
MO BLING set the pace, felt pressure from an outer bidder down the backstretch and into the far turn, yet drew away turning for home, and was driven
home to seal the deal. ANITA'S VISION stalked the top pair from the three path entering the backstretch, inched closer under a drive in the four path turning
for home, gained place entering the lane as the leader shook clear, and was second best. KITTENOFTHE COURT stalked along the inside around the first
turn before, engaged the pace setter from the outside at the five furlong pole, pressed into the far turn, but failed to keep pace leaving the quarter pole, and
gave way on his left lead. TRINITY HOPE broke awkwardly, trailed around both turns, and made little impact. UNIFIED LOVE lacked speed in the two path,
and never got involved. CZAR'S BALLERINA tracked along the inside, chased around the far turn, and faded.

Footnotes
TRAFALGAR settled behind early, moved at the half mile pole while still behind leaders, was brought out at the quarter pole, grinded down the leaders at
the eighth pole and secured the victory. UNINVITED GUEST had the lead early from the inside, was hooked by company down the backstretch, was in
contention until the eighth pole, then was passed by an outer foe and faded. OPEN ROAD was in company with the leader into the first turn traveled from
the four path just off the leader down the backside, was in striking distance coming out of the second turn, was asked at the quarter pole responded while
still in company with another foe, but didn't have enough. MY ROMEO LIMA was on the outside of the second tier through the first turn and down the
backside, stayed with that set through the far turn, gave a slight effort down the lane, but faded by the three sixteenths pole. JOB SECURITY stalked from
the inside to the half mile pole and gave way. RUSSIAN TANK never involved.

Footnotes
GOLD PUNCH set a clear pace in the two path, shifted out and dug in to resist an outer rival's bid in upper stretch, and held firm through the final furlong.
TWO B stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, ranged up in the five path in upper stretch to produce a bid, but was fended off.
KINGOFBROKENHEARTS tracked from midpack in the four path, came into the lane in the six path, and ran on to hold show from an inner rival. BIG
SCULLY took light brushes from rivals on both sides at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, stayed on in hopes of bidding for show inside of
KINGOFBROKENHEARTS in the final furlong, but leveled off. HOLIDAY DIAMOND broke half a beat slow, raced far back along the inside, altered course
outwardly in upper stretch, but failed to make an impact. HUFFS TAZ A BOO leaned out at the start, trailed two wide, and got outrun. KAHAAL checked
when an outer rival put him to tight rail quarters at the eleven sixteenths pole, then saved ground in midpack around the turn, but weakened.

Footnotes
SUPREMELY tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted out four wide leaving the quarter pole, rallied to bid exiting the furlong grounds, dueled with a
game inner rival through the late stages, and narrowly prevailed. TIM TAL tracked three wide, bid in upper stretch, led entering the final furlong, resisted an
outer rival's bid leaving that station, sparred gamely thereafter, but was nailed at the wire. OVERANALYTICAL stalked along the inside, chased from behind
the leading trio in upper stretch, shifted outside of them in the final furlong, stayed on late along with an outer foe, closed in as the leaders tired nearing the
wire, but came up short. TRUMPTASTIC laid off of the pace in the four path, chased while shifting course further out, then offered a late kick in the final
sixteenth, but ran out of ground to catch the leaders. WAR ROOM sped clear early on, showed the way in the two path, but was headed by a pair of foes at
the furlong grounds, and faltered entering the final sixteenth. KISLOVODSK lacked speed in the five path, and made little impact. CLOUD WITHOUT REIN
chased two wide and from between horses into the turn, but weakened. UNAFFILIATED showed little.

TROBAIRITZ stalked the leader from the inside, at the five eighths pole she was let out a notch, where from there she steadily built momentum up, and won
by many. LADY JEOPARDY broke outside challenged for and took the early lead, she was keen in her bridle while being rated around the first turn, she was
passed by her competitor at the five eighths pole, she chased the new leader around the turn from the inside into the stretch, started to fade at the eighth
pole but had done enough early to maintain second. HANNAH'S HAVEN traveled behind the early leader in company with other foe through the first turn
and down the back stretch watched the lead change at the five eighths pole, traveled in company with another foe through the turn, was asked coming out
of the turn but didn't fire.

Footnotes
TREASURY set a clear pace, opened up to a wider margin down the backstretch, then maintained a clear advantage while tiring in the final furlong, and
lasted safely. AMERICAN HERO lagged behind, saved ground while catching the field turning for home, rallied between horses in upper stretch, sustained
advance on his left lead while tipping out in the final sixteenth, and gained place late. OMAHA RED lacked speed in the four to five paths, then stayed on
evenly in the six path. BRITAIN'S KITTEN tracked from midpack along the inside, tipped to the three path around the far turn, bid for place in midstretch,
gained that position in the final furlong, but was outkicked by an outer pair in the closing stages. MOMENT stalked in the two path, resisted an outer rival's
place bid in midstretch, but yielded between horses late. SEARCH ENGINE broke through the gate while waiting for the final horse to load, then was
restless after being re-loaded, laid off of the pace in the three path, saved ground around the far turn, and failed to menace. BEAVER HAT lacked speed in
the four to five paths around the first turn, pursued from the four path while between horses around the far turn, then chased from between horses in the five
path through the lane before yielding in the final sixteenth. SONNEMAN raced far back along the inside, then in the four path around the far turn, and made
little impact. AWE SHACKLE tracked in the three path, but weakened between horses entering the far turn.

Footnotes
ROCK STAR ALEX stalked two wide, assumed command entering the lane, and held sway. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT lagged behind, rallied along the rail
around the far turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch, blew past inner rivals to claim place at the furlong grounds, and was gaining on the clear leader
late. STONE ALLIANCE bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, bid for place between horses at the furlong grounds, but got outkicked
shortly after. HALF A DOODLE tracked two wide and from between horses early on, but only managed to chase the leaders around the far turn before
giving way. CHIEFWEAVE took a bump from an inner foe at the start, dictated terms with a clear advantage, but offered little resistance to an outer rival's
bid entering the lane, and weakened on his left lead. R T'S D'ORO took a bump from an inner rival at teh start, lacked speed five to four wide, and made
little impact. PROBLEM CHILD tracked three wide and between horses entering the backstretch, but was done early before being eased around the far turn.
EDDIE'S HUMOR bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked four wide and between horses, but weakened turning for home before being eased.
