Footnotes
RAVENCLAW dueled along the inside on the backstretch, continued dueling with rival on the turn and into the lane, headed in upper stretch and battled
gamely to come back and prevail. KIMBERLY'S DEVIL dueled outside of rival throughout and led mid-stretch, outgamed by inside rival in a tough loss.
AWSOME DONNA chased dueling rivals on the backstretch, continued well placed on the turn and into the lane, failed to take advantaged but stayed on
enough to hold show. NASHIRA'S FIRE broke out and bumped rival at the start, stalked pace well off the rail on the backstretch, continued in the four path
through the turn, entered lane widest and made mild progress. G G RULES away well and asked to stalk the pace along the inside, continued to save
ground on the turn, roused in upper stretch and failed to deliver. JEANIE'S SWAN settled off the rail and off the pace on the backstretch, entered turn in the
three path and went in a path for most of the turn, entered lane in mild contention and shared fifth with weakening inside rival. HUDSON FLYER dropped
back on the backstretch, continued to trail on the turn and entered lane widest, lacked bid and passed tired rival in the lane. RAGTIME GIRL stumbled and
bumped by inside rival at the start, stalked pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
AUNTIE BEV sent clear on the backstretch, continued clear on the turn and into the lane, wandered a bit and drifted out in the stretch but proved best to win
clear. MIGHTY BOISTEROUS tracked leader along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn and into the lane, launched willing
bid to get up for second while never threatening winner. AM YISRAEL CHAI chased clear leader on the backstretch, saved ground through the turn and in
rang entering stretch, lacked need kick in lane to threaten and weakened late to lose second. QUEEN VERRAZANO stalked pace three wide on the
backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, spun her wheels heading into the lane and lost ground, regathered her momentum and finished up willingly.
MY BELLA CHICK tracked pace two wide on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn, launched bid in the four path and outfinished in the lane.
THISONESFORBARRY lacked needed speed early, saved ground throughout and failed to launched a menacing bid.

Footnotes
RUNAWAY WYWY vied for lead two wide on the backstretch, bumped with rival early on the turn, gradually edged away on the turn and drew clear in the
lane to win convincingly. ASARO stalked pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered lane in the three path and finished up
willingly to snag second. MOUNT OLYMPIC away best, aggressively wrangled back by rider exiting the chute, apparently dueling with outside rival was the
preferred trip, continued along the inside on the turn and unsurprisingly failed to outfinished rivals in the lane. SHARP WARNING customarily dropped back
on the backstretch, continued to trail on the turn and launched belated bid to pass some rivals in the lane. SOUL PRODIGY stalked pace along the inside on
the backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn and came up empty in the lane. EDINBURGH EXPRESS showed some speed early, tried to get rail
position but shuffled out of spot, while still recovering from the shuffle, had to put on the breaks yet again entering the turn and lost all chance after that
debacle.
