Footnotes
CAPTAIN SAM hustled clear leaving the chute and angled in to rate the pace, was urged away at the rail on the turn, driven into the stretch and steadily
handled to the wire. SECRET AFFIRMATION chased outside through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path and proved no match in the lane.
CHIT CHAT GIRL chased the leaders through the backstretch, eased outward on the turn and left the turn widest, finished well for third later yards and was
gaining on the runner-up. MARY'S LISTED NEXT chased the pace, rounded the turn about the four path then flattened in the lane. ADABEL chased toward
the inside, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened in the lane. MS BIG SPRING chased the pace inside but steadied from tight quarters at the rail
nearing the quarter pole and weakened on the turn. LIL SWEETHEART chased then weakened while saving ground on the turn.

the far turn and cleared second mid-stretch. FREEDOM RIDER rounded the first turn off the rail, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the three
path of the far turn, then dueled for third. BUFF'S EYE VIEW saved ground well off the early pace, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
raced near the rail on the far turn and was boxed at the rail leaving the turn, altered course mid-stretch but ran out of ground. AUBURN MILL set the early

the five path of the far turn. STRONG LIL KOKORO rounded the first turn about the three path, left the turn outside and faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
NICO stalked the early pace three wide then challenged into the backstretch, dueled for the nod three wide midway on the far turn and dug in determinedly
to eke out the advantage over the game effort of SOCIAL CHIC, who stalked off the rail the first turn and took the lead into the backstretch, dug in to the
challenges of Cowboy At Heart to his inside and Nico to the outside, was met midway through the far turn but dug in gamely to the finish. FANCY CONCHO
rated close off the rail on the opening turn, picked up the chase approaching the five sixteenths pole but flattened stride toward mid-stretch. DEBIT CARD
came in early then saved ground on the opening turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and passed
rivals in the lane. COWBOY AT HEART moved to the inside and rated the pace, was met leaving the half mile pole and dueled from that point, but dropped
back at the rail midway on the far turn and weakened in the lane. CASANOVA KITTEN was squeezed from early contention and rounded the first turn about
the four path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened in the four path of the far turn. INSIDE RISK steadied into the first turn, left the turn
outside and gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn two deep and weakened into the lane.

Footnotes
MR CHANCE ROMANCE stalked the earlier pace from the two and three paths, took the lead toward the seven sixteenths pole and turned away In High
Gear through the backstretch, rounded the far turn off the rail then dug in under steady handling to hold on. NEVERFOLD saved ground well off the pace on
the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn, dueled for second mid-stretch, closed to the outside girth of the
winner late yards but hung approaching the wire. LOGSTRADAMUS stalked in the four path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and
raced close off the rail on the far turn, but flattened stride the final sixteenth. MARCHED rated close inside on the first turn, closed to a brief slim lead past
the five sixteenths pole, was met and dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and weakened in the lane. TWILIGHT YEARS exchanged contact with
Hillbilly Rock leaving the gate and rounded the first turn in the four path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn
and showed little in the lane. IHEARTRAINACOMN saved ground off the pace, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, raced in the five path of the far
turn and showed little in the lane. IN HIGH GEAR set the early pace inside, was met approaching the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point,
but faded off the rail on the far turn. HILLBILLY ROCK exchanged contact with Twilight Years and bobbled after the break, also made contact with Neverfold
soon after the start then saved ground.

Footnotes
CHERRYS CROSS settled in the four and five paths the opening turn and raced wide into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and
steadily progressed to take the nod three wide midway on the far turn, dueled clear of SLOE GIN BIZ mid-stretch and widened the final sixteenth. The latter,
stalked from the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took a brief slim lead past the quarter pole, was met midway on the far turn,
dueled close through the upper stretch but relented the final sixteenth. GANDHI'S ORION stalked the earlier pace from the two and three paths, picked up
the chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths and came along for third later yards. DADDY Z tapered in
and stalked the early pace two deep, took the lead into the backstretch and dueled clear of Steady Eddie approaching the five sixteenths pole, but was met
at the rail passing the quarter pole and flattened into the lane. SMOOZER saved ground well off the pace on the first turn, gave chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. BROTHER MERLE gave up several lengths when he dwelled in the gate,
saved ground racing well back but bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and improved his position. STEADY EDDIE set the early pace inside, was met leaving
the first turn and dueled from that point, but dropped back approaching the five sixteenths pole and gave way at the rail. PLAYING GOLD saved ground on
the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn. OBOY rounded the first turn in the four and five paths,
left the turn outside, faded through the backstretch, raced in the five path of the far turn and was eased in the lane.
