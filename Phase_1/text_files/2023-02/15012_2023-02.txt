Footnotes
MONROE broke in and bumped lightly with a foe then was hustled, contested the pace on the outside then in the two path around the turn, kicked clear
under a strong hand-ride into upper stretch, drew off under a right-handed crop into the final furlong then was placed under a solid hand-ride to the wire
while much the best. BIG HAZEL was urged along off the pace, traveled four wide around the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and safely secured
the place while no match for the winner. KRYSTALHEIR was last to commence, raced at the rear of the field, went three then four wide around the turn, was
guided well out into the final furlong and just got up for the show. MY ANGEL was urged along off the pace, moved in near the nine-sixteenths, saved
ground around the turn, moved out in upper stretch and just missed the show while narrowly earning the last spot in the superfecta. QUEENS OVER
THREES showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of the winner, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired.
MAJESTIC RETURN chased the pace down the backstretch, moved from the rail to the two path around the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and came
up empty. DEBBIE DARLING bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along on the outside, angled in late on the backstretch, rounded the turn in the two
path and was no factor. NAUGHTY NAN hit the outside of the gate. AERON WARRIOR broke out and bumped with a foe, steadied some while in tight
between horses nearing the five-eighths then dropped back, angled in shortly thereafter, raced inside to the two path on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
FIRST DEPUTY five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five
wide for home, closed well outside and was up in the final jumps to score. FOOLISH GHOST coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the
inside comfortably in front, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, widened away to the eighth pole, dug in
under growing late threat when drifting out and leg weary and was nailed in the final strides to the finish. MASKED MARAUDER broke out at the start
bumping GANDY DANCING in tandem with RUVIES IN TIME, chased three then two wide, came under coaxing along the inside at the three-eighths,
continued in the inside route into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. QUICK RETURN hustled from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and stayed on one paced to the end. RUVIES IN TIME broke in at the start bumping GANDY DANCING in
concert with MASKED MARAUDER who broke outwards, chased three then two wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home
and weakened in the late stages. GANDY DANCING got bumped between foes at the start who each broke his way, chased four paths off the inside down
the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside for home and
offered no response. DOUBLE SHOT chased four to five wide early on until tucked to the two path with nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and made no headway.

Footnotes
DREW'S GOLD disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, shook clear into upper stretch and
drew away under steady urging. CLUBHOUSE leaned out at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked for more in the three path on the turn,
spun four wide into the stretch and earned the place while no match for the winner. JOEY FRESHWATER settled on the inside, moved to the two path near
the five-sixteenths while roused, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. DAYDREAMING BOY
broke out then bumped with a rival and was last to commence, moved out at the rear under urging, went four wide around the turn, spun five wide into the
stretch and came up empty. KOOL KATHMANDU stumbled at the start then bumped with a foe but broke with the field, disputed the pace on the inside of
rivals, vied along the rail on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
SUNDAESWITHSANDY showed good speed, moved clear outside the nine-sixteenths, drew off in the two path on the turn, responded well in the stretch
and widened while kept to the task. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS was very sluggish early and dropped well behind, saved ground on the turn, shifted four wide
outside the quarter-pole then swung six wide into the stretch and improved for the place. IRISH HONOR was hustled from the gate, pressed the early pace
then dropped back inside the three-quarter pole, fell further back under urging late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path and improved for
the show. LEDDY bumped with a rival at the start, pressed the pace on the inside of the leader, dropped back outside the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on
the turn, remained on his inside lead in the stretch and tired. CRYPTO CASH dropped well back early, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide
into the stretch and was no factor. PIT BOSS brushed with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the turn and failed to
respond. COOL QUARTET stumbled outward at the start then bumped with a foe and was last away, angled to the outside then was coaxed on the far
outside, went four wide around the turn and had nothing left. MY FRIENDS BEER brushed with a foe at the start, settled off the pace, was urged four then
five wide on the turn and also failed to respond. SWIFT TAP bobbled at the start, was forwardly placed on the outside, dropped back three wide under
urging on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
ANEJO got pinched between foes at the start and was forced to steady, chased along the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled
three to four wide into upper stretch, closed well to issue a challenge showing good courage to take command just inside the sixteenth marker, then inched
away to the finish. SHIPSATIONAL chased along the inside and then just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into
upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. MACALLAN coaxed from the start, chased three to four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four wide
into upper stretch and closed belatedly to secure the show honors. PATIENT CAPITAL broke in at the start bumping ANEJO in tandem with SILVER
SEEKER and forcing that foe to steady, showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, took the inside route into upper
stretch, dug in under growing threat and was caught just inside the sixteenth marker, kept on to preserve the last major share. MAGIA NERA coaxed from
the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued two to three wide for home and weakened in the late stages. ROYAL
TRYST hustled from the start, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and made no late headway.
SILVER SEEKER broke out at the start bumping ANEJO in tandem with PATIENT CAPITAL and forced that foe to steady between them, chased briefly just
off the inside before tipping four wide midway down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung
three wide into upper stretch and weakened. LOOSE GOOSE chased two to three wide until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing three
furlongs from home, went four wide into upper stretch and weakened. GIANT'S FIRE four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path
through the turn coming under a ride at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired.

shook clear under a drive into the final furlong, drifted in outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand-ride with his ears pricked while much the
best. ARCTIC ARROGANCE went to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail around the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside
on the far turn, was asked into the stretch, lost the advantage to the winner at the three-sixteenths and proved no match while well clear for the place.
GENERAL BANKER was rated in the three path on the first turn, settled down the backstretch, was urged three then four wide on the far turn, turned into
upper stretch under a drive and came up empty while best of the rest. ANDIAMO A FIRENZE went five then four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on
the outside, made a bid under urging in the three path on the final turn, dropped back into upper stretch then moved out and capitulated. PROVE RIGHT
showed early speed, raced in the three path around the first turn, prompted the pace outside of the leader, was urged along late on the backstretch, vied in
the two path on the final turn, dropped back near the five-sixteenths and had nothing left. JUNGFRAU bumped with a rival at the start, was taken up off

Footnotes
CAMM' DUKE vied five paths off the inside down the backstretch before seizing sole command half a mile from home, tucked three wide through the turn,
went five wide into upper stretch and went clear under a drive to prevail. FOUR EYES chased four to five wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,
swung six wide for home and improved position to secure the place honors. LIEUTENANT SAM vied three to four wide down the backstretch before tucking
inside through the turn knocking heads with the eventual winner to the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and weakened while along for the show
honors. CENTRAL LOVE broke out at the start bumping EXCALIBRATE, vied very briefly and then chased just off the inside under a ride from the
three-eighths, swung four wide for home and weakened. BUSTINUPISHARDTODO bumped at the start by SOMAMA BEACH, came under hustling and
vied inside early on, chased through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. EXCALIBRATE got bumped
at the start by CENTRAL LOVE, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun two to
three wide for home and made no impact. SOMAMA BEACH broke in at the start bumping BUSTINUPISHARDTODO and stumbled when making contact
with that foe, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. M. C.
DOUBLE R three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. MILAGROSO seven paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and
proved no factor.
