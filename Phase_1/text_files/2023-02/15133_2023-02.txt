Footnotes
LONZO WHO tracked the early pace, raced seven wide through the turn, took control stretch and edged clear. ATTILIANNO was unhurried early, loomed
eight wide through the turn, couldn't match strides with the winner, drifted in and finished second best. GO RED RASCAL pressed the early pace, raced six
wide into the turn and weakened late. EVACUEE set a pressured early pace, went five wide into the turn and gave way. ALL CHROME was void of any
early speed, advanced between rivals and finished belatedly. DIABOLICAL GATOR stalked the early pace, saved ground and faded. LARIAT was allowed
to settle early, raced six wide and retreated. HENNESSY'S SQUIRT was reserved early, went three wide into the turn and never fired.
