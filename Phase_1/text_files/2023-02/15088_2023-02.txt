MIDNIGHT NIGHTMARE tracked the leader from between horses around the first turn then made a bid at the three eighths pole to engage the leader at the
five sixteenths pole and took the lead before the quarter pole then drew off. BOURBON ST TAPPIN was allowed to settle around the first turn the moved up
on the backstretch to make a four wide bid at the five sixteenths pole but was no match for the winner. MASTERLY was off the pace on the inside around
the first turn then settled in the middle of the pack down the backstretch and passed tiring rivals. LAUGHINGSAINTSSONG went to a clear lead to the five
sixteenths pole then was challenged and fought gamely around the final turn but tired. TEMPRANO was forwardly place then was in tight nearing the end of
the first turn, settled down the backstretch and made a mild rebid but was not a threat. MICAJAH stalked the pace from the three path to the quarter pole
and dropped back.

THAT'S MY MAMA raced in the middle of the pack then made a four wide bid at the five sixteenths pole to run down the leader in the stretch to clear late.
CUTE DINERO QUEEN tracked the leaders from the two path down the backstretch the dropped to the inside going into the turn and bumped
XTRAFRIESWITHAT but keep on to split horses and made a late surge to be up for the place. LOVELYREDSTILETTOS hustled to the lead and drew clear
around the turn but was caught late. COOL HOT CHIC hopped at the start then rushed up to press the pace early, chased the leader around the turn and
tired. MY LITTLE MIA veered in at the start then saved ground through the turn, angled out to three wide in upper stretch to be best of the rest. CUSTOM
CANDY was pinched after the start then slowly advanced through the turn, went widest into the stretch to show late interest. MOLLI WAY had no speed and
remained back. ARMS APRIORITY raced near the back down the backstretch then made a three wide bid into the turn but faltered. XTRAFRIESWITHAT
was off the pace on the inside, when entering the turn she was in tight and bumped by CUTE DINERO QUEEN and had to check and dropped back.

and tired. COUNTRY CUT raced in the second flight from the two path to the seven sixteenth pole then made a rail bid around the final turn but was empty.
