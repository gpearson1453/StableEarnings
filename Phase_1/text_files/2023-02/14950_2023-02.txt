Footnotes
DOC ADAMS was closest in pursuit from the two path, asked right handed late on the bend, drew alongside the leader nearing the eighth pole, took over
midstretch and inched clear. TALKLESSWORKMORE took control early from inside, set all the pace to the stretch, challenged by DOC ADAMS with a
furlong remaining, lost the lead midstretch and was outfinished in the final sixteenth. BIG TALKER traveled two then three wide around the first turn at the
back, moved closer while moving inside a pair of rivals, roused on the far turn along the rail then moved to the two path around the bend, could not reach
the top pair in the final furlong and churned on for a clear third. BANG FOR YOUR BUCK broke a hair slow, steadied briefly when losing his path shortly
after, tracked on the inside then moved out a bit around the clubhouse turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened. CONTINENTAL DIVIDE broke
through the gate and was reloaded, tracked three deep then four wide early, went two wide into the second turn, eased out and came four wide into the
stretch and also weakened. BOTTLE OF SMOKE stalked two then three wide on the clubhouse turn, remained off the rail then traveled outside a rival on
the far turn, entered the lane five wide and tired.

Footnotes
VERY SCARY sped clear and crossed over to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch, urged right handed in the final furlong and held safely. SLAM
DIEGO stalked the pace on the inside, chased two wide into the stretch, took aim at the winner in the lane but finished evenly in the final furlong. GLENALL
(IRE) trailed on the inside early, raced outside a rival into the far turn, swung five wide into the lane and produced a mild rally to earn the show honors.
AWESOME TAYLOR bumped with CARPE FORTUNA early, settled inside, saved ground to the stretch and gained a minor award along the fence.
WEEMISSGRAMMY broke outward to hit the gate, pulled early then settled in a stalking position two wide, exited the far turn three wide and flattened in the
late stages. CARPE FORTUNA bumped with AWESOME TAYLOR while rank early, settled outside a rival early on, angled four wide leaving the far turn and
lacked further response.

NEWGATE dropped back early then went outside a rival to give chase, started to pull while two to three wide on the first turn, remained in hand up the
backstretch, moved closer on the far turn and bid three deep with a quarter mile remaining, dueled with HARD TO FIGURE in the final furlong, took over
near the sixteenth pole and dug in to prove best. HARD TO FIGURE dueled with ARABIAN LION into the first turn then pressed from outside, headed that
rival at the five-sixteenths pole, gained the lead entering the stretch, dueled with NEWGATE in the final furlong, lost command with a sixteenth remaining
and stayed on gamely to the wire. WORCESTER stalked a bit off the rail early, chased the top trio along the inside into the lane, moved out in the stretch
and finished willingly for the show honors. ARABIAN LION dueled from inside into the first turn then inched ahead and set the pace under pressure, headed
by HARD TO FIGURE again at the five-sixteenths pole, lost command into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
QUATTROELLE (IRE) tucked inside near the back early, patiently handled on the far turn while continuing to save ground, tipped out at the top of the
stretch, put to right hand urging and surged between rivals midstretch and drove past BAY STORM in the final sixteenth. BAY STORM stepped to the front
from inside then led a bit off the rail into the backstretch, controlled the pace in the middle stages, met the bid from ONE SILK STOCKING at the
five-sixteenths pole, maintained a short lead over that rival into the final sixteenth but was outfinished by QUATRROELLE (IRE) in the end. CLOSING
REMARKS stalked the pace from between rivals in the two path, bid inside the leader entering the final furlong, finished willingly near the fence but was not
enough. ONE SILK STOCKING was closest in pursuit in the two path to the far turn, engaged the leader from outside at the five-sixteenths pole, dueled into
and down the stretch but faltered late. SCHOOL DANCE stalked three deep around both turns, moved out in the lane and lacked a bid. OAKHURST was off
a bit slow on the outside, trailed two wide into the first turn then went outside a rival, spun four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. NADETTE (FR) stalked
the pacesetter inside a pair of rivals, saved ground through the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
BUS BUZZ got bumped in the beginning, dueled briefly then sprinted clear, opened up a comfortable lead and saved ground through the turn, urged once
right handed midstretch and widened under steady handling. CATALINA EDDY broke slow on the inside, chased along the fence through the turn, could not
make an impact on the winner in the lane but was clearly second best. SEATTLE SURF turned his head slightly to come away a step slow then shifted in
and bumped inner rival, dueled briefly then chased the winner up the backstretch, rounded the bend three then two wide and weakened in the lane.
UPWARD MOBILITY coaxed from the gate, dropped back off the pace, traveled along the inside at the back into the turn, saved ground to the stretch and
earned a minor award. GHOSTLY ACT raced outside a rival at the back into the turn, spun three wide into the lane and came up empty. RHYTHEM ON
STAGE broke quickly but also inward and bobbled a bit, dropped back off the pace, took the turn four then three wide, eased in the lane and walked off.

HENRY Q broke inward to bother ARROWTHEGREAT, moved up and stalked the leader on the inside, roused nearing the quarter pole, asked right handed
in upper stretch, responded nicely by launching a bid from the fence midstretch and drove by BLUEGRASS GO GO in the final sixteenth. BLUEGRASS GO
GO sprinted clear and crossed over, took pressure from outside on the turn, held a short lead into the final furlong, led into the final sixteenth and yielded
grudgingly to HENRY Q in the end. BIG HAT WILLIE forwardly placed in the early going, bid outside BLUEGRASS GO GO on the turn but could not sustain
the challenge past the quarter pole, chased within range into the final furlong and kept on to earn the show honors. MOTORCADE broke a step slow,
stalked four deep into the turn, bid three deep past the five-sixteenths pole, fought to deep stretch then flattened to fourth. ARROWTHEGREAT was off slow
and forced in leaving the gate, climbed early and dropped back, raced four wide through the turn and summoned a mild response improve placings but

Footnotes
GENIUS JIMMY showed keen early speed while dueling then cleared inner rival and moved to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch, drew away when
asked right handed in upper stretch, switch to the left hand at the sixteenth pole and was ridden out late. ESCAPE ARTIST tracked the pace from inside,
saved ground and was closest in pursuit through the lane, could not make any headway on the winner late but was well clear of the next runner for second.
MALTESE FALCON (IRE) hopped at the start come away last, trailed on the inside early, passed a rival in the middle stages, went two to three wide around
the far turn, rallied between foes and brushed with inner rival midstretch and gained the show. EXCEL CALCULATOR traveled in mid-pack on the inside,
remained along the rail then came out a bit into the lane and improved position. EASTBOUND traveled three deep of the pace early on, went two to three
wide on the far turn, moved out in the lane and lacked a rally. KEEN TO GO stumbled leaving the gate, raced three wide off the pace, remained off the rail
and spun four wide into the stretch and could not rally. FAST CHAD angled to the inside racing near the back into the first turn, trailed into the second bend,
entered the lane a bit off the fence, moved out further in the lane and made no impact. SAN ANTON (IRE) stumbled leaving the gate, unhurried on the
inside, saved ground to the stretch and failed to menace. SHADOW CREEK (IRE) broke a bit slow and bobbled, sat off the pace between rivals in the two
path, continued in the two path into the stretch, could not advance through traffic with a furlong remaining and failed to regain the momentum once in the
clear. SINGLE TRACK MIND (IRE) chased two wide outside a rival early on, spun three wide into the lane, could not summon the needed rally, got brushed
by MALTESE FALCON (IRE) in midstretch and retreated. BOLT SUPREMACY dueled early for the lead then ceded command first time in the stretch,
stalked in hand early, roused on the far turn, chased two wide into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
FUN TO DREAM trailed early then took closer order up the backstretch, traveled along the inside then moved to the two path on the turn, waited behind the
leaders at the quarter pole, roused while tipping three wide into the stretch, drew alongside the top pair under left handed urging, took over in midstretch and
kicked clear in the final sixteenth. AWAKE AT MIDNYTE brushed the gate, stalked three deep up the backstretch, challenged three wide with three furlongs
remaining, fought two wide into the lane, gained command in upper stretch but proved no match for FUN TO DREAM in the furlong grounds. SAMURAI
CHARM prompted the pace from outside, took over into the turn, vied between rivals then moved inside after clearing ANACAPA around the turn, lost
command in upper stretch and flattened to third. LADY T lugged out early on the backstretch, stalked four deep to the turn, challenged four then three wide
around the bend and weakened in the final furlong. ANGEL NADESHIKO raced in range early then dropped back to last, trailed three then two wide on the
turn and failed to menace. ANACAPA set the pace with SAMURAI CHARM applying pressure, lost command into the turn, vied inside rivals then started to
weaken past the five-sixteenths pole and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
EARLS ROCK (IRE) tracked the pace on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch, moved off the fence and rallied
between the top pair, took over late and prevailed over the late surge from the runner-up. DU JOUR broke a step slow, unhurried early on the inside, moved
into the two path on the backstretch, altered out from behind a rival in upper stretch, split foes at the eighth pole, surged late four deep and missed. AIR
FORCE RED bobbled leaving the gate but was still away near the front, rated early off the rail then three wide on the first turn, closest in pursuit from
outside in the middle stages, engaged the leader with three furlongs left to run, kept the pressure on through the lane, raced on even terms with a sixteenth
remaining, put a nose in front briefly before being overtaken by EARLS ROCK (IRE) and lost the place. IRIDEO (ARG) was antsy in the starting gate,
chased between rivals and bumped with outer foes on the first turn, continued between off the pace, exited the far turn three wide, tipped out in the lane,
closed well and rounded out the superfecta. DARK SHIFT (GB) was off slow in the beginning then sprinted to the front and crossed over, showed the way
up the backstretch, met the challenge from AIR FORCE RED at the three-eighths pole, maintained a short lead into the stretch, resisted to the sixteenth
pole and succumbed to the pressure late. CABO SPIRIT taken back early and steered to the inside, angled out around the far turn and came four wide into
the stretch, steered out widest in the lane and finished with a mild rally. BOB AND JACKIE away quickly then moved into a stalking position, saved ground
through the far turn under light coaxing, roused leaving the bend, put to right handed urging in the lane and never found the needed late kick. KISS TODAY
GOODBYE traveled towards the rear early, saved ground around the far turn and improved position. ANACONDA settled outside a rival early, three deep in
the middle stages, exited the far turn four wide, moved out further in the drive and lacked a rally. HIT THE ROAD stalked four deep around the first turn,
three deep on the second bend and weakened. THERE GOES HARVARD chased three deep and bumped with inner rival on the first turn, raced between
foes in the two path on the second bend, shied from rivals whip in midstretch and weakened.
