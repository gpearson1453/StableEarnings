Footnotes
FABULOSITY was away alertly, set all the pace, came in a bit nearing the sixteenth pole taking away the running lane of Presley's Artwork. An objection
was filed and stewards disqualified Fabulosity and placed second for interference. PRESLEY'S ARTWORK pressed the pace, raced along the inside
through the stretch run, forced to check sharply nearing the sixteenth pole, angled out kept on willingly to the wire. VIRTUALLY chased the early pair, raced
three wide through the turn and gained ground late. DOLLY DIMPLE chased the early pace, raced near the rail and had not enough in the drive.
WUMPMUG was hustled along, raced three to two wide and had no response. SERENGETI SIX dropped back early, raced four wide near the eighth pole
and never was a factor.

pace, moved up four wide around the far turn and closed in late in a willing effort. STAYTHIRSTYMYAMIGO dropped back to the back of the pack early on,
moved up two to three wide between rivals in the stretch and made a late gain. BOLD LEGEND stalked the pace while racing just off the inside and faded.

Footnotes
RED RED WINE vied for the early lead along the inside, shifted out two to three wide and just got up under all out pressure. OLIVIAN showed good early
speed from the inside to set the early pace from the outside, raced well clear near the eighth pole and missed in a game effort. GURL YOU FINE was
coaxed along from the inside and closed in late in a game effort. STUNTING dropped back early, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and made a
good late gain. LOTS OF GOLD was hustled along while racing just off the inside, raced four wide near the eighth pole and was even late with no closing
run. D'WILD MUFFIN dropped back early, raced along the inside around the far turn and had no response. CHIVE UP was hustled along, raced four wide
and never was a factor. SUCH GREAT HEIGHTS failed to respond. ROME'S BURNING broke awkwardly, raced five to six wide around the far turn and
never threatened.
