wide leaving the turn, was well positioned but flattened out between horses. LOOKIN SPUNKY chased the pace three wide around the turn and weakened
the final furlong. MERGER OF EQUALS was outrun. POET IN MY HEART , two wide on the turn, chased the pace to the stretch and gave way. C TWO

Footnotes
GREAT GO GO broke on top and handled some early pressure from ONE MORE FACTOR, went clear heading to the half, dug in after that one rebid from
the outside leaving the far turn, went head to head from the five sixteenths, established command inside the sixteenth pole and proved resolute under
steady handling. ONE MORE FACTOR prompted inside early on, rated back off the winner nearing the turn then shifted out, bid three wide leaving the far
turn, dueled, raced on near even terms in mid stretch and kept on gamely in a sharp try. SPRING THE BEAST stalked the dueling leaders while three to
four wide, was under pressure into the lane but lacked a serious finish. SHOULDA HAD IT , outside a rival while off the pace, shifted out five to six wide and
faded. CONFUSION BABY BOY had an equipment adjustment behind the gate, raced to the inside of a foe entering the turn, dropped back around the turn,
angled out and came up empty.

Footnotes
RAHMER , bumped at the break, was sent up between rivals soon after and gained a stalking spot, spied a duel past the three eighths while three to four
wide, closed in steadily and engaged BRION from his outside in mid stretch, took over soon after, responded to left handed asks and drew away. BRION
sped to the front, set a rated pace two wide while handling outside pressure, shook clear without much urging leaving the five sixteenths, wandered outward
when taken on in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. YOUNG TURK edged up three wide early on and prompted the pace, applied more pressure leaving
the three eighths, failed to kick on with the leader into the stretch and faded through the final furlong. CRIMSON ROCKET , bumped and in tight at the
break, regrouped and saved ground early, angled out leaving the far turn, circled four wide into the stretch and churned on between foes. HAMPDEN LANE
, off the pace and outside a rival, angled five wide into the stretch but lacked a solid finish. ADDY'S LADDY T N T , fractious behind the gate, came out
some at the break and bumped with CRIMSON ROCKET, saved ground with some early pursuit, dropped back leaving the far turn and failed to recover.

Footnotes
UNCOMMON VALOR raced in the two path between horses on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch, worked between horses, bid for the lead
near the sixteenth pole and got the bob. BRANCO MARIA , wide on the turn, floated to the six path in upper stretch, challenged for the lead outside the
winner in deep stretch and just missed. STRONGER THAN DEX prompted the pace two wide around the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, went clear
approaching the eighth pole and weakened the final sixteenth of a mile. CHAMBO saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, moved to the four path in
upper stretch, and flattened out. STIMULUS MAKER , three wide on the turn stalking the pace, floated wide turning for home and gave way. SUTTON
VALLEY set the pace along the inner rail and faltered the final furlong. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE was not a factor. UNDER FIRE was outrun.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN QUINT rated kindly about four wide and not too far off of a contested early pace, cruised up four wide outside rivals to loom mid turn, responded
when asked in upper stretch, forged clear of ASKIN FOR A BASKIN heading to the furlong grounds, drifted in some and held firm under a drive. UNION
FLEET , perched three wide off the leaders, edged up past the five sixteenths, was pushed along heading into the lane, churned on willingly and was
second best. MAGIC MULE rated inside, swung out for the drive and kept on with some interest. ASKIN FOR A BASKIN had speed two wide to take the
early lead, was hooked from his inside by SUPREME LAW near the five eighths, battled around the turn, held a tenuous advantage nearing the stretch,
failed to contain the winner in mid stretch and faded. SUPREME LAW , off last after bobbling and being put in tight, rushed up inside and engaged ASKIN
FOR A BASKIN after a quarter mile, sparred with that one into and around the turn then gave way. PHRA PHROM , off the pace and off the inside, angled
well wide and failed to respond. HIGHLAND DREAM chased to the lane, shifted out and faded. MONSTER MASON saved ground leaving the far turn and
weakened.

leaving the backstretch, raced in the two path between horses on the turn, moved to the three path leaving the bend, raced inside a rival through the lane
and got up for second. ON THE MARK , four deep around the turn, rallied on his left lead. LOST WEEKEND raced along the inner rail throughout and
retreated through the stretch. ICE COLD FROSTY , no factor, floated five wide leaving the turn. ALOTTACENTS lacked speed, swung to the seven path in
upper stretch and came up empty. GENERAL NOOZ , a forward factor early, raced in the three path on the turn and gave way. SWIFTY DEVIL sped to the
early lead, was kept in the two path around the turn and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
AMERICAN D'ORO broke a step slow then relaxed well back while saving some ground, gathered momentum mid turn then eased out to work between
rivals entering the stretch, dropped in past the quarter pole, responded to right handed asks and surged along the rail to engage ZABRACADABRA past the
furlong grounds, gained a slim advantage leaving the sixteenth pole and dug in tenaciously under steady handling to prove best. ZABRACADABRA ,
bumped at the break, quickly straightened and stalked the leader while about four wide, took closer order leaving the far turn, went on the attack from the
outside entering the lane, responded when set down past the quarter pole and spurted clear, was guided down towards the winner after being taken on
inside the eighth pole, battled gamely from there but was kept at bay. HELLO HOT ROD opened up early, set the pace well off the rail and under some
nudging, was put to a firmer ride once engaged into the stretch, fought on past the eighth pole then gave way grudgingly in the final seventy yards.
ALWAYSINAHURRY , jostled at the break, was hustled up soon after then taken to some rating, saved ground advancing into the far turn, gave futile chase
past the three eighths and faded. WHISKEY AND YOU , three wide and within range into the turn, failed to respond leaving the three eighths and gave way.
