OUR UPTOWN GIRL was rated along the inside early, split rivals nearing the five sixteenths, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole and drew off in
the lane to prove best, driving. BEACH BANKER set the pace while in the two path, then was headed leaving the turn and was no match for the winner
while staying on to be clearly second best. MORE RANSOM was allowed to settle early, angled out in the stretch and finished well for the show award while
no threat to the top two. DENALI RAE tracked the pace three wide and weakened. SNAPPY RIDE hopped at the start, reserved early and lacked a solid
rally. UNION RALLY tracked the pace four wide and weakened. PURELY SILVER showed speed on the inside and stopped.

ONCE A GIANT was allowed to settle early, between rivals on the backstretch, advanced four wide on the turn and came five wide into the lane, closed well
to get up late to prove best, driving. BOSSY CAT was five wide into the first turn, rated along four wide and made a four wide bid on the turn to take over
leaving the turn but was caught late. LONG TOM was rated along the inside, eased out on the turn and came three wide into the lane, lacked room in the
lane and did run on in traffic, rough trip. SOUPER EMPEROR prompted the pace four wide and made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command but
faded the final furlong. MR BOLDACIOUS was reserved on the inside, angled out in the lane and had a late rally. JUMP FREE pressed the pace and made
a bid between rivals and then weakened. TUCKABUCKAWAY was settled back early, advanced wide on the turn and then was empty in the drive.
WINNERS WIN lacked a solid rally. PEAKY BLINKERS set a pressured pace on the inside and then vied for command by the half mile marker and checked
by the quarter pole and weakened. PRINCIPALITY chased the early pace and tired.
