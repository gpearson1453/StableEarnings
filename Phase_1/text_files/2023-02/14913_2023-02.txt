Footnotes
THE GREY BEAUTY was brushed by an outer foe into an inner rival at the start, then got jostled among foes in the opening furlong before checking back
passing the eleven sixteenths pole, settled off oft the pace in the three path, shifted out to the five path at the three furlong pole, then rallied in midstretch to
bid entering the final sixteenth, and edged away. WHY WAIT pressed inside of the pace setter early on, backed off to stalk from the pocket nearing the turn,
tipped to the three path while between horses in upper stretch, grinded away outside of the leader to bid along with an outer foe at the sixteenth pole, but
was outkicked. PARAMOUR took a brush from an outer foe at the start, then received a bump from them soon after, bid in upper stretch, forged an
advantage at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer pair of bidders in the final sixteenth. CHEYANN GLITTERS leaned in and brushed a foe at
the start, then bumped that foe multiple times in the early stages, set the pace two wide, cleared to the rail into the turn, dug in in upper stretch, but was
headed at the furlong pole, and faltered late. REALITOS trailed in the three path, then improved inside of rivals. B B GUN BULLSEYE broke out at the start,
tracked four wide, but weakened between horses in midstretch. PINEAPPLE ALLEY prompted the pace three wide, but weakened between horses entering
the lane.

Footnotes
WESTERN COMMAND tugged four wide down the backstretch to press the leader from the three path entering the turn, ranged up in hand while his rider
peaked for competiton entering the lane, inched clear in upper stretch, and held sway. JUSTFORSPEIGHTOFIT vied along the inside, rated back to stalk at
the five furlong pole, tipped two wide entering the lane as the leader inched clear, took aim inside of that foe coming to midstretch, but only managed to
chase in the final furlong, flattened out late, and narrowly saved place. KISLOVODSK laid off of the pace in the two path, tipped to the three path while
behind rivals entering the lane, chased among foes through midstretch, then stayed on in the final sixteenth, but missed reaching place. CONRAD THE
RED trailed in the three path, swung out to the five path in upper stretch, and stayed on late. I'M YOUR CAPTAIN hopped and broke a step slow at the start,
tugged forward in the three path while inside of the eventual winner early on, but got antsy between horses at the half mile pole, shifted outside of them and
to the four path while under mild coaxing into the turn, but lacked a bid before tiring between horses in midstretch. FOWLER CASTLE set the pace in the
two path, but was headed entering the lane, and faltered at the three sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
ALLNIGHT MOONLIGHT set the pace in the two path, drew away from an outer presser with a half mile to go, and widened handily through the lane.
ANDERS SMILE prompted the pace setter from the four to three paths around the first turn, but failed to keep pace with that one at the half mile pole, and
held place thereafter. IRON MOON broke slowly, tracked two wide and between horses, pursued from the three path around the far turn, then chased
through the lane. OWEN THE ICE MAN tracked along the inside, but gave way. SONYA KNOWS BETTER laid off of the pace three wide, shifted out to the
six path into the backstretch, then faded in the five path around the far turn, and made little impact. MAIN DUDE trailed in the four to six paths around the
first turn, and was outrun. SUIT OF WANDS stumbled at the start, stalked in the five to four paths around the first turn, but came under coaxing between
horses at the half mile pole, and weakened around the far turn.

Footnotes
WOODS N WATER tracked in midpack in the three to two paths around the first turn, tipped outside of the leaders and to the four path entering the lane,
grinded away to bid outside of MARTINIZED entering the final sixteenth, but lugged inwardly and bumped that foe while edging an advantage late. WICKED
ROSE saved ground while trailing, tipped two wide entering the lane, rallied between horses in midstretch to bid inside of the leader at the sixteenth pole,
but was outkicked by an outer rival late. MARTINIZED stalked two wide, bid around the far turn, gained an advantage turning for home, drew clear in the
three to four path in upper stretch, wandered about while hanging on his left lead in midstretch, was met bids from rivals on either side in the final sixteenth,
then steadied when put to tight quarters by his outer challenger nearing the wire. BATTLE OF WILL settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted out from
the three path to the four path turning for home, but drifted to the seven path entering the lane, and failed to threaten. GEORGE ALLEN set the pace along
the inside, but was headed by an outer bidder turning for home, and yielded in upper stretch. FORTY THREE tracked three wide, but weakened while being
floated to the five path entering the lane. GUITARTUITION PLZZ lacked speed two wide, then yielded in the four to five paths around the far turn.
FOLLOWING A RIDER'S OBJECTION OF MARTINIZED AGAINST WOODS N WATER FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, AS WELL AS A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY, WOODS N WATER WAS DISQUALIFED AND PLACED THIRD.

SWOT ANALYSIS set the pace inside of a pressing rival into the turn, shook free of him entering the lane, and held sway thereafter. FATHER GOOSE
pressed outside of the pace setter, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, and chased him home well through the final furlong. AVAILABLE STAR tracked
along the inside, but steadied when put to tight rail quarters into the turn, took the bend in the two path while off of the pace, surpassed an inner tiring rival in
upper stretch, and sustained a rail chase while hanging on his left lead to reach show in the final sixteenth. YANKEE SEVEN tracked four wide, but only
managed to chase evenly through the lane before losing show to an inner rival in the late stages. JAX MAN raced at the rear, took the turn in the four path,
and failed to menace. CREOLE CHARLIE hopped at the start while off just over a length slow, tugged between horses to a three wide stalking position, but
checked once rank from restraint at the nine sixteenths pole, tucked to the rail entering the turn, then faded through the lane. FIERY PLAYBOY broke a step
slow, laid off of the pace along the inside, trailed into the turn, was held up behind a rival in the two to three paths around the bend, but was outrun through
the lane.

SUNDAY BREEZE saved ground far back, trailed down the backstretch, rallied inside of rivals around the far turn, encountered traffic among foes after
changing leads approaching midstretch, altered course outside of the newly leading GOOD OLD CHARLIE in the final furlong, and surged late to prevail at
the wire. GOOD OLD CHARLIE laid off of the pace in the three path, got rank briefly nearing the backstretch, tucked to the rail with five furlongs to go,
gained inside of foes into the far turn, stalked from the two path around that bend, tipped outside of the leading pair nearing the lane, sustained a bid at the
furlong grounds, led in the late stages, but was caught at the wire by an outer oncharging foe. CHARLI MICHAEL pressed outside of the leader, gained an
advantage into the far turn, dug in to resist an outer bid in midstretch, but yielded to that foe and another rival in the final sixteenth. DUVEE leaned in and
bumped a rival at the start, set the pace in the two path, but was headed at the three furlong pole, and yielded in upper stretch before darting outside of foes
entering the final sixteenth. ITS WILD AGAIN raced at the rear in the two to four paths around the first turn, then in the three path around the far turn, and
moved up between horses in the late. OAK HILL LG took a bump from an outer foe at the start, tracked from midpack in the two path while under a snug
hold around the first turn, pursued from the four path around the far turn, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and failed to factor. EASY RUNNER
broke out, tracked the top pair from the four path, chased them from the three path around the far turn, then weakened once floated four wide entering the
lane. LILRASCALMAN laid off of the pace in the three path, but faded in the four path around the far turn. COUYONS CAUSE stalked along the inside, but
weakened between horses around the far turn.

MO SATURDAYS bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked from midpack while just off of the rail, shifted outside of the leading trio and to the six path in
upper stretch, sustained a grinding charge while hanging on his left lead, lugged across a rival's path while bidding leaving the furlong grounds, sparked a
duel with MENDELSSOHNS MARCH in the process, but lugged inwardly while sparring through the late stages, bumped his inner counterpart nearing the
wire, and prevailed. MENDELSSOHNS MARCH set the pace along the inside, repelled a bidding rival entering the lane, dug in to resist another outer foe's
challenge leaving the furlong pole, sparred gamely while being herded inwardly through the late stages, then took a bump from his outer counterpart nearing
the wire, and got nailed. MORE THAN FIVE stalked outside of the top pair, pursued from the five path in upper stretch along with an outer rival, got
outkicked by that one while hanging on his left lead in midstretch, and chased the embattled leading pair home to prove best of the rest. SIR leaned
outwardly and bobbled at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the two to three paths, and moved up. ICE TIME hopped before
being bumped by an outer rival at the start, shifted in and steadied behind rivals in the aftermath, trailed in the two path, advanced in the four to three paths
into the far turn, tucked entering the lane, and flattened out while hanging on his left lead. DUAL MONARCHY pressed two wide, bid turning for home, but
was repelled entering the lane, and tired. GUIGUI lacked speed in the three path, trailed around the far turn, and was outrun. CITY OF GOD was fractious in
the gates while awaiting the start, took a brush from an inner foe at the off, then stalked along the inside, but faded around the far turn. FOLLOWING A
RIDER'S CLAIM OF FOUL OF MENDELSSOHNS MARCH AGAINST MO SATURDAYS FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, AS WELL AS A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY, MO SATURDAYS WAS DISQUALIFED AND PLACED SECOND,

Footnotes
RECKLESS RANSOM dueled two wide, led between horses around the turn, resisted his outer rival's bid while in the four path entering the lane, and
tenaciously clung to a margin through the final furlong. BIG BELLA BROWN pressed three wide, bid in the five path entering the lane, dueled thereafter, but
was denied. LT. BONURA dueled for the lead along the inside, got headed by a pair of rivals around the turn, yielded in upper stretch, yet held show
through the late stages. WHY JOEY WHY bumped with an outer rival at the start, chased along the inside, tipped to three path in upper stretch, bid for show
in the final sixteenth, but was kept at bay. GRACIDA was tough to load, trailed along the inside, drifted out approaching midstretch, and made little impact.
NOSY BANKER chased from the three to four paths while between horses around the turn, but tired. MR. NASTY TIME bumped with an inner rival at the
start, saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. WICKED ALEX broke outwardly, lacked speed three wide, and never got involved.
KNOCKALITTLELOUDER tracked in the four to five path, but weakened after coming into the lane in the six path.
