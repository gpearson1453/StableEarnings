Footnotes
AMERICAN GRANT chased five then four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily
gaining to take command seventy yards from home, then inched away to the finish kept to task. PETROLO coaxed from the gate, advanced after the start to
poke a head in front five furlongs from home just off the inside while in hand and under pressure from WHO ME to the outside, shook off that rival midway
on the turn confronted inside by FOUR EYES and got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got headed for command spinning three wide into upper
stretch, came again to take back the front just inside the three-sixteenths, dug in under new threat to the outside in the form of the aforementioned foe and
was worn down with seventy yards to the finish while along clear for the place honors in a good effort. FOUR EYES veered out at the start bumping
ETERNAL GLORY into CHASIN' YOU, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the inside through the turn getting placed to
coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced along the rail to issue a bid nearing the quarter pole, seized narrow command at that station and spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in and was displaced from the front just inside the three-sixteenths, then flattened out in the late stages while clear for the
show honors. WHO ME hustled from the gate, showed the way early on before being headed five furlongs out, prompted that rival from the outside three
wide through to the midway point on the turn when placed to coaxing, spun just off the inside into upper stretch in retreat and weakened in the late going.
WONKER WARRIOR hustled from the start, chased just off the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, angled four to five wide for home and passed
tired rivals. CHASIN' YOU got bumped at the start by ETERNAL GLORY due to pressure from FOUR EYES veering outwards, raced six paths off the inside
down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and tired. ETERNAL
GLORY got bumped at the start by the veering outwards FOUR EYES and in turn bumped CHASIN' YOU, chased three wide until tucked inside through the
turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
BREAKING STONES broke in but was away clearly in second position, raced towards the front while coaxed along well behind the runaway leader, traveled
around the turn in the two path under urging, gained late on that bend, spun four wide into the stretch then made a bid outside of the leader around the
three-sixteenths, gained a short advantage inside the furlong marker, fought outside of the runner-up into the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong
handling. LOHENGRIN TWO was hustled from the gate, angled in while speeding clear, opened up a sizable advantage, raced inside around the turn, saw
the advantage diminish while turning into the stretch in the two path, was headed by the winner inside the furlong marker, fought on into the final sixteenth
but was outfinished while well clear for the place. CLASH A. J. came inward at the start, was coaxed along well off the pace, saved ground around the turn,
swung six wide into upper stretch and improved for the show. CHIEF ENGINEER broke very fast then was taken in hand early, moved to the outside of the
pacesetter then raced in second position on the outside, was urged along in the three path around the turn, spun five wide into the stretch, remained on his
inside lead in the drive and lacked the needed response. UNO settled off the pace, was urged four wide around the turn, came five wide into the stretch,
drifted in coming to the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. MY MAN MATTY acted-up just as the latch was being sprung then broke in and hit the gate,
was off slow in a staggered start and spotted the front a few lengths, settled towards the rear under some restraint, saved ground while let out and
advancing closer around the turn, moved to the two path into upper stretch and had nothing left for the final furlong. BASIS RISK was carried in while off a
bit slow, raced at the rear under some urging, rounded the turn in the two path, came under the crop outside the five-sixteenths and was no factor.

Footnotes
MAKER'S CANDY prompted the pace three wide down the backstretch and through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took over command
and was floated out five to six wide into upper stretch by D'ONT LOSE CRUZ, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in switching to the wrong
lead and drifted out herding out NEURAL NETWORK three paths being shown a right handed crop while guided by a left handed rein only, got corrected
briefly and then came out an additional two paths once again with an active left rein while being flashed a right handed crop nearing the finish impeding
NEURAL NETWORK, and forcing that rival to steady off his heels while holding safe to the wire. NEURAL NETWORK chased three to four wide under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, ran on outside nearly latched on and was herded out three paths from just inside the
eighth pole to near the sixteenth marker, briefly got respite before being herded two additional paths and forced to steady off the heels of MAKER'S CANDY
nearing the finish and was along for the place honors. DR. KRAFT stumbled at the start in an awkward splaying motion getting away last, grew detached at
the tail of the field before settling into stride and chased along the inside down the backstretch, came under coaxing half a mile from home and launched a
prolonged steady rally through the turn and spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, showed good courage to continue closing along the inside as the
top pair took the scenic route and was along to miss for the place honors. D'ONT LOSE CRUZ showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure
from MAKER'S CANDY to the outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, floated that same rival out four to five wide into upper stretch when
displaced from command, then weakened in the drive. STARQUIST three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled four
wide into upper stretch and tired. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run as well as a claim of foul by the rider of NEURAL NETWORK against
MAKER'S CANDY for interference in the stretch. After review, it was deemed that NEURAL NETWORK had been interfered with through the stretch run by
MAKER'S CANDY and therefore MAKER'S CANDY was disqualified and placed second before the race was declared official.

Footnotes
LASTCHANCEATGLORY stalked the pace on the outside, issued a challenge in the four then three path around the turn, took the lead outside the
five-sixteenths, was put to a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the runner-up near the eighth-pole, fought back gamely to regain the lead in the
final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed under strong handling. PRINCE OF PHAROAHS was well placed down the backstretch, drafted inside to the two path
around the turn, shifted three wide while asked late on that bend, gained to make a four wide into upper stretch, took a short lead coming to the furlong
marker, led while battling outside of the winner into the final sixteenth but was denied while clear for the place. HAMMERIN AAMER settled under some
urging, went three wide early on the turn, shifted four wide and bumped a foe while coming through a tight gap between rivals nearing the five-sixteenths,
was driven five wide into the stretch, chased the top two while outside of ROYAL TRYST in the drive and finished willingly to just get the show. ROYAL
TRYST was hustled from the gate, moved in leaving the chute, angled to the rail around the five-eighths, saved ground on the turn, came out in upper
stretch, remained on his inside lead while inside of HAMMERIN AAMER in the stretch and just missed the show. LOST IN ROME was urged early then
angled in, advanced inside of a foe to take the lead before the three-quarter pole, showed the way under pressure, was asked in the two path under threat
on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner outside the five-sixteenths and tired. GENTLEMAN JOE drifted out leaving the chute, settled on the outside,
went four to five wide under urging on the turn, was bumped nearing the five-sixteenths, spun six wide into the stretch and came up empty. IT'S
MANDATORY showed speed then pressed the pace, dropped back under urging in the three path early on the turn, floated five wide into the stretch and
capitulated.

Footnotes
GRANNYS CONNECTION forwardly placed five paths off the inside down the backstretch, advanced and tucked to the two path half a mile from home
taking over command inside that station, widened away in hand through the latter portion of the turn and swung three to four wide into upper stretch, then
went clear in hand through to the finish receiving very intermittent taps to the right shoulder to the wire. FANCY FELINE got bumped and pinched back just
after the start due to pressure from BERN ROSEY BERN, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn,
went six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. ROYAL CURRENCY just off the inside early
on, tipped three then four wide down the backstretch before tucking briefly to the two path before heading three wide midway on the turn under coaxing from
the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. JET SET JULIET bobbled at the start, then got bumped by BERN ROSEY BERN
into FANCY FELINE pinching that foe back against STEAL MY HEART, showed the way three wide down the backstretch before tucking inside half a mile
from home getting displaced from command soon after, chased along the inside through the turn, spun three wide for home and weakened in the stretch.
BERN ROSEY BERN came out after the start bumping JET SET JULIET into FANCY FELINE and in turn STEAL MY HEART, chased three then two wide
under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went three wide for home and tired. STEAL MY HEART broke in brushing the near side stall at the start then got
bumped and pinched back FANCY FELINE in tandem with JET SET JULIET due to pressure from BERN ROSEY BERN, chased four then three wide under
a ride from the seven-sixteenths, cornered five to six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CARIBBEAN (AUS) settled off the pace, came under urging near the nine-sixteenths, saved ground around the turn, gained into upper stretch, drifted out
under a left-handed crop approaching the furlong marker, switched to a right-handed crop while closing fast on the tired leader outside the sixteenth-pole
and got up late to prevail. AIR SHOW was hustled to the front then sped clear, extended the advantage late on the backstretch, remained well clear under
urging while inside on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, came under a right-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths, led while shortening
stride into the final sixteenth then switched to a left-handed crop and was caught while able to get the place. LIL COMMISSIONER showed speed on the
inside of a rival then dropped back before switching out around the eleven-sixteenths, was urged three wide around the turn, moved out while gaining on the
leader in upper stretch, pursued that foe into the final furlong and finished willingly to just get the show. DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY settled off the pace, was
urged four wide around the turn, moved out while gaining in upper stretch and also finished willingly but just missed the show. DUST DEVIL settled off the
pace, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch then angled further out and lacked the needed response.
MIDNIGHTCHARLY raced near the rear of the field, started the turn in the two path, shifted four then five wide shortly thereafter, dropped back to the four
path outside the quarter-pole and was no factor. MOUNT TRAVERS was unsettled in the gate and not prepared tor the start, broke out and hit the outside of
the stall while last to commence, dropped to the rear of the field, moved from three wide to the rail early on the turn, saved ground from that point into the
stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
I'M BUZZY chased along the inside from near the rear of the field, tipped briefly two wide into the turn before heading three wide when placed to coaxing at
the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied tipping out two additional paths near the eighth pole, then surged home in the final sixteenth
and was just up on the wire to score. KANT HURRY LOVE tossed her head and was caught in the hands of the starter as the latch was sprung getting away
last and conceding four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased three wide steadily gaining down the backstretch and through the turn
under coaxing from the three-eighths, went five wide into upper stretch, traded a bump with KITTEN'S APPEAL at the three-sixteenths and rallied to take
command inside the eighth pole, dug in under growing late threat and was nailed on the wire. KITTEN'S APPEAL chased four then three wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, traded a bump with KANT HURRY LOVE with three-sixteenths to go and ran on to
secure the show honors. CAPTAINSDAUGHTER six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, went eight to nine wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. LADY MILAGRO showed the way in hand just off the
inside safely in front through swift splits, tucked inside through the turn and remained patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive under growing threat from a pair and was collared inside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. AWILLAWAY
chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and made no late
headway. YO CUZ hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then along the inside through the turn under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. BABA chased three then two wide under a ride from three furlongs out,
angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened. CHASING CARA coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,
went six to seven wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
REPO ROCKS showed speed between foes while under intermittent urging, moved up some inside a foe to reach even terms for the front under urging at
the three-quarter pole, was wrestled back off the pace outside the five-eighths then rated just off the pace under a very vigorous hold, tugged at the bit while
drafting inside to the two path around the turn, released the brakes to make a four wide bid into upper stretch then took the advantage, fought outside of the
runner-up into the final furlong then drew clear under steady urging while much the best. MILES D veered out at the start, moved up with five furlongs to run,
prompted outside from that juncture, was let out in the two path around the turn, gained the lead coming to the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner
under a drive in upper stretch, fought with that foe into the final furlong and proved no match while able to get the place. FAR MO POWER steadied some
behind horses nearing the five-eighths then moved out, chased in the three path around the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick
while able to get the show. BOURBONIC dropped back while showing no speed then moved out, was urged three then four wide around the turn, came six
wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. BLACK BELT went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked along the rail on
the turn, lost the advantage approaching the quarter-pole and gave way. TOUGH TICKETS was taken in hand off heels inside the seven-eighths then rated
under a tight hold, steadied off heels near the five-eighths, dropped back under urging leaving the backstretch, traveled around the turn in the two path,
spun three wide into the stretch and failed to respond.
