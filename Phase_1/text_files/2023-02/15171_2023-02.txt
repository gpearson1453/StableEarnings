DE' ANS EIGHTY broke to the outside, was allowed to find his stride from the back of the field, stayed in touch with the field from the four path along the
backside, was asked in the turn and started to make up ground, split horses coming out of the turn, dropped closer to the rail near the three sixteenth pole,
was kept to task, and caught the leader mid stretch and out finished the rest. KEEP LEFT was sent out for the early lead, attended the pace down the
backside and through the turn uncontested, was near the end but tired. UNBRIDLED ANNSLEY broke outwardly, then settled right off the leader in the
second tier from in between horses, stayed with company down the backside, chased the leader going into the turn, was on the rail behind the leader at the
three sixteenth pole and flattened out. SENSE OF HEART broke out at the start, sent with another competitor for forward positioning, was in between on the
backside, shifted down to the rail at the three eighths pole, chased, not enough. DAPHNE'S FIRE broke and moved into the second tier, traveled wide
around the turn and was never involved. BABY YOUR PERFECT vied for the early lead, settled for second tier along the rail, was pressure3d from the

DE SAIX contested the pace outside, shook clear entering the stretch, drifted out through the final sixteenth but held safely. ALILNALOT hopped at the start
and was away behind his field, rushed up toward the inside, shifted out entering the stretch, kept on well but was unable to reach the winner. MO MOVES
disputed the pace along the inside to the stretch, weakened during the drive but had enough left to preserve the minor award. GREEN BEANS was
unhurried, came four wide to make a belated improvement, but failed to seriously threaten. BRIARTOWN settled in the second flight three deep and lacked
a response. PERMAFROST settled off of the inside and failed to respond.

SAM STORMY attended the pace inside, got through to make his bid, reeled in MORE THAN FIVE in the final sixteenth and was up late. MORE THAN
FIVE tracked three wide, moved up to engage the leader midway through the second turn, forged command entering the stretch, fought on but was unable
to resist the winner. KID KETCHUM settled toward the inside, took closer order on the second turn, shifted out four wide nearing the quarter pole, angled out
further in the lane and was making up ground. DECCAN PRINCE (IRE) contended three deep, launched a bold bid four wide, but flattened between rivals
during the drive. SIR LIAM was unhurried between horses, tucked in on the second turn, got through entering the stretch, tipped out a bit, was blocked and
altered back to the inside near the sixteenth pole and kept on once clear. SIR was unhurried, circled into the stretch six wide and finished with a belated
improvement. ODDSONTONY settled off of the inside and failed to respond. JOINT VENTURE broke through the gate, opened clear to set the pace, was
headed on the second turn, stayed on to the final furlong and succumbed.

INVULNERABLE broke sharp, set the pace, was able to maintain the lead through out. GILCREASE settled into the second tier along the rail, was hooked
by an outside foe through the turn, took a brief breather, rallied at the quarter pole, came off the rail, closed well but just missed. DISTORTED PRO chased,
in between, showed little. TODDCHERO was far off the pace early, gained ground and was within striking distance by the quarter pole, faltered late.
NATURAL HARBOR raced in the second tier early, went wrong, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
FREE DROP MADDY opened clear to dictate terms, was kept to task and held sway. OLIVIA G settled in hand, launched a bold bid circling four wide,
brushed with NEW DESTINY near the furlong marker and was unable to reach the winner. NEW DESTINY was forwardly placed along the inside, got
through to make her bid, came together with OLIVIA G a furlong out, weakened slightly in the drive and settled for the minor award. GUITAR WOMAN was
allowed to settle, looped into the lane three deep to make a mild bid, but failed to make headway. SHE TOLD YOU SO was unhurried, shifted out and
finished with a belated improvement between foes. FOR HARPER was never a factor. HOPEITSMYLUCKYDAY failed to respond. AGAMI chased three
wide, but stopped before going six furlongs.

Footnotes
DESERT DUKE was sent out for the early lead, maintained comfortable fraction while all alone, was asked at the three quarter pole and responded, swung
wide and drew off. HE'S GOT SWAGGER was mid pack early along the inside, set sites on the winner after the three quarter pole, was hustled and pushed
closed well and just missed, game effort and up for place. TWO RIVERS OVER settled off pace, went widest early, ducked in in the lane but didn't fire.
SCAT DANZ rated off the leader, was within striking distance, started to launch a bid for the win but could not make up ground. Ran even. MINNESOTA
MOON off the pace early, put in a mild bid, moved up was gaining ground then brushed by an outer foe in the stretch and stopped. ICE TIME was far back
early along the rail, passed one into the turn but never fired after that. CLASSIC DANCER broke outwardly, settled off pace, moved closer to the field, at the
half, but had no rally.

Footnotes
ALLNIGHT MOONLIGHT opened clear to dictate terms and remained unchallenged. BENOIT settled off of the inside, came three wide, got through toward
the inside, failed to menace the winner but finished willingly to prove the best of the rest. MANGUM broke awkward, was unhurried into stride, tucked in to
save ground, moved up through the second turn, angled out entering the stretch, was impeded in traffic near the furlong marker, altered inward and
continued on fairly well. JACK HAMMER bobbled at the start, rushed up three deep, took a run at the winner on the second turn, came up empty entering
the stretch, drifted out in the final furlong and faded. STIFF DRINK was unhurried, came five wide and finished with a belated improvement. GOBOT failed
to respond. REAL ACTION was close up along the inside to the second turn and dropped out. MY LIL DUDE showed little.

Footnotes
TOPSY dueled along the inside through the turn, shook clear entering the stretch and held safely. JUST LIKE MAGIC was allowed to settle, tucked in to
save ground, moved up through the turn, wheeled out nearing the furlong marker, quickened once uncovered and finished fast. SHOPLIFTER stalked the
pace, launched a bold bid between rivals entering the stretch, but flattened and settled for the minor award. TITLED LADY attended the pace four wide,
loomed a danger entering the stretch, but weakened during the drive. SHE'S JERSEY TUFF saved ground to some avail. FLAMAND dueled outside through
the turn and tired. VARMLANDER settled in hand, ranged up five wide to make a mild bid leaving the turn, but failed to sustain the drive. TAYLORS TAP
was never a factor. NEUTRALIZE was through early.

Footnotes
BRIGADIER GENERAL opened clear to set the pace, fought on through a long drive and was fully extended to narrowly prevail. GUNTOWN settled in hand,
moved up four wide through the second turn, dug in when set down for the drive, kicked on well but wasn't quite good enough. CRUMP tracked three wide,
but flattened in the drive and settled for the show spot. JEEPER settled off of the inside, shifted out four wide leaving the second turn to make a mild bid, but
failed to sustain the drive. BRIGHT SPARK was unhurried along the inside, split horses entering the stretch and finished with a mild advance. COUSIN
LARRY was allowed to settle three wide, but lacked a response when called upon. TRIGGER HAPPY was forwardly placed along the inside to the stretch
and tired. SETNA THE WISE failed to respond. RICKY BOBBY showed little.
