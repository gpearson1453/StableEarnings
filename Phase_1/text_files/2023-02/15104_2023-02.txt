Footnotes
GOLDEN OLDIE set an unchallenged pace towards the inside, drew out on the turn and then drifted out slightly leaving the furlong marker and held sway
late to prove best, driving. READY AT MIDNIGHT was reserved early on the inside, angled out at the three eighths marker to make a four wide move on the
turn, came five wide into the lane and closed well. FAIRY CAKES (GB) tracked the pace on the inside and eased out on the turn and came four wide into
the lane and faded, held show award. MS MERRABEL was in tight into the first turn, then chased the pace on the inside and lacked the needed bid, missed
show award. ZAWADI was void of early speed, angled out in the lane and had a belated rally. VIVE EL MOMENTO tracked the pace in between rivals and
weakened. BELLE OF ST. JOHN tracked the pace three to four wide and tired. NOTREALLYNOTREALLY failed to respond. TENAKEE chased the pace
four to five wide and tired.

Footnotes
PLAYLIST was rated along the outside, made a four wide move on the turn to be in contention leaving the turn, lugged in by the furlong marker, continued to
close and got up late to prove best, driving. FANCY CABER NEIGH dueled for the lead on the inside and made a bid leaving the turn to gain a short lead,
then dug in late but was caught, held place award. POPNFIZZ stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole but was
outfinished. MISCHIEVOUS DOLL tracked the pace and was two wide on the turn, tried to split rivals leaving the furlong marker, but that hole closed up and
had to check by the sixteenth marker and angled out late but had no kick, rough trip. FRACING LUCKY was fractious in the gate, reserved early, between
rivals on the turn, then dropped to the inside by the quarter pole, angled out in the lane and had a belated rally. WEEHAWKEN dueled for the lead two wide,
then was between rivals by the quarter pole and weakened. LIAM'S GIFT was reserved early, came four wide into the lane, then lugged in by the sixteenth
marker and had no rally. CUTE KHLOE was reserved early and lacked the needed stretch bid. MEET IN SECRET failed to menace. SILENT REVENGE
was of slowly and not a factor. MIDSUMMERNITEDREAM tracked the pace on the inside and weakened. The Trainer of MISCHIEVOUS DOLL filed an
OBJECTION versus both FANCY CABER NEIGH and POPNFIZZ for interference around the sixteenth marker, after the STEWARDS reviewed the video
replays the OBJECTIONS were not allowed and the race was left as is.

the wire. BEATBOX was allowed to settle on the inside, then was two wide by the half mile marker,shifted out by the five sixteenths and made a five wide by

the turn but weakened. FANCY LIQUOR chased the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn and weakened. HARLAN ESTATE was well placed early
on the inside and weakened. PRICE TALK was settled three wide early, advanced on the turn and came five wide into the lane and was bumped leaving the

Footnotes
LAUGH AND PLAY was away alertly and well rated on the front end in the two path, then came three wide off the turn and floated out to the five path and
drew clear under right handed crop urging to prove best. RICHIES GREAT GIRL chased the early pace four to five wide, then made a wide run on the turn,
then finished willingly to gain the place award. FAST GISELLE tracked the pace on the inside, then eased out and came three wide into the lane while
making a bid, but needed more late. STORMING LADY tracked the pace and made a four wide bid on the turn but flattened out. KRISPY RICE stalked the
pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but weakened. HEY THERE steadied between rivals leaving the five eighths marker while trying to be rated,
then lacked a late response in the lane. LEGERITY was allowed to settle and saved ground on the turn and had no rally.
