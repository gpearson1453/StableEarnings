Footnotes
CHELSEA WALL saved ground throughout, raced close up, rallied in the stretch and edged clear late under a drive. TIZ A SHARPIE settled well off the
pace, moved wide in the stretch to gain the place. MOONCHILD hustled to the front, moved clear before half a mile then weakened but came again for the
show. SOLEMN OATH chased close up outside, bid to the front in midstretch but hung in the final furlong. ABIDALE was fanned very wide on the first turn,
lagged far behind then passed faders while no factor. SUMMARY JUDGMENT prompted the pace outside for five furlongs and gave way. ONE WILD
WOMAN raced off the leaders near the inside and stopped. CHEWY CHEWY GOOD lacked speed and stopped abruptly.

dueling pacesetters, bid to the front in the stretch and held on gamely. COMMISSIONER G trailed for half a mile, advanced wide and closed well too late.
BUFFALO SHUFFLE vied for the advantage outside to the stretch and weakened. OSPREY lacked speed, chased wide and failed to threaten. DIESEL
dueled along the inside to the quarter pole and came up empty. YES IT'S ROO raced outside and began fading on the turn. PORTAL ONE saved ground
and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
JW'STRICKYMISCHIEF showed good early speed to set the pace, moved away on the turn, responded when roused and was kept to the task through the
lane. PRINCE FILIP chased on the inside, chased on the turn, dug in gamely inside in the stretch run and earned the place award. SHANGHAI SUPERFLY
chased two wide, chased on the turn, finished evenly and outkicked for second. HE HATE ME raced off the rail, off the pace, came four into the lane and
closed belatedly. REDEEM EDDIE raced off the pace inside and lacked a rally. PRINCE JAMES chased between rivals, chased on the turn and weakened.
SNEAKINESS raced off the pace, came four wide into the lane and did not factor. PUTTHEGLASSDOWN dropped far back early and showed little.

GOLDEN SPOKE settled off the pace, chased the dueling leaders on the turn, moved up, commenced his rally in upper stretch, closed steadily outside and
was up late for the win. HIGH VELOCITY dueled two wide for the early lead, dueled between rivals on the turn, dug in gamely inside of BREITHORN in the
stretch run, put away that rival, edged away at the sixteenth marker and was caught late. BREITHORN raced close up outside, bid three wide on the turn,
dueled outside rivals, put a head in front entering the stretch, dug in and weakened in the final sixteenth. STRUM AND PLUCK was outrun early, asked on
the turn and did not factor. REJECTED AGAIN dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn and faded.

EASY DAY lacked speed inside, angled out rallying into the stretch, wore down the pacesetter and was up late in a long drive. EGO MAN quickly took
control under rating, remained clear in midstretch and held on gamely. HOOPLA prompted the pace outside early, moved inside on the turn and finished
willingly. B B BAD trailed briefly then angled inside with a gradual late gain. IN SKY WE TRUST raced within striking range outside and proved empty in the
stretch. HUSHION urged closer three wide down the backstretch then gave way in the stretch. FAST BREAKIN CASH flashed speed along the inside and
faltered. LAZARETTO broke awkwardly, rushed up wide then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
ROAN MOUNTAIN raced off the pace inside, advanced on the far turn, continued inside entering the stretch, rallied, closed willingly, dueled with PARADISE
PRIDE in deep stretch and prevailed. PARADISE PRIDE pulled in the early stages, raced close up on the rail, tracked while saving ground, waited for room
at the quarter pole, rallied on the rail, took over past the eighth pole, then dueled with the winner and dug in gamely to the finish. WIZARD SERRAT raced
two wide off the pace, moved up four wide on the far turn, came seven wide into the lane, drifted in bothering foes, rallied mildly and got third. STAY
HYDRATED vied inside in a contested early pace, dueled inside rivals on the far turn, dug in and then weakened. LAVERY raced off the pace between
rivals, came five wide ino the stretch, rallied, was steadied behind a rival at the furlong marker, altered course outside and rallied late. AHSAD vied between
rivals for command, dueled on the far turn and tired. SOCIAL GROUP raced three wide off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn, came six wide into
the lane, steadied in tight, then lacked a rally. HIBACHI vied three wide for the lead, dueled on the far turn and faded. SKILLFUL was outrun. After a
Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey Objection by the rider of LAVERY against the third place finisher, WIZARD SERRAT was disqualified and placed fifth.

ground throughout, bid at the quarter pole, continued well but could not get by the winner. AMBITIOUSLY PLACED lacked speed, advanced in the two path
on the final turn and was easily third. DESERT DALLIANCE prompted the winner outside for five furlongs and faltered. CHRONOLOGY stalked the

the leaders outside and gave way readily. FUNWHILEITLASTED saved ground, moved briefly closer before half a mile then stopped.

TWISTED RIDE vied outside for the lead, dueled with FIVE DREAMS on the turn, battled it out with that rival in upper stretch, gained command and drew
clear under urging in the final sixteenth. FIVE DREAMS showed sharp early speed, vied inside for command, dueled with the winner on the turn, dug in
gamely in upper stretch, was no match, then held on well to save the place spot. ROB THE RICH stalked the pace, chased the dueling leaders on the turn,
rallied outside in the stretch and went evenly late. JALEN JOURNEY raced off the pace inside and closed belatedly on the rail. FAST BOB stumbled at the
start, raced off the pace inside, chased on the turn and had no rally. HERO TIGER chased outside a rival, chased on the turn and faded.
NONEEDTOWORRY raced two wide off the pace and did not factor.
