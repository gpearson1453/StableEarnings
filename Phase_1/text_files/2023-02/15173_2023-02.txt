Footnotes
LUCK IS GOLDEN away in good order, dictated terms early on and drew to a clear lead into the backstretch run, set decent fractions while well handled into
the far turn, repelled the bid of QUE SERA SIR RALPH leaving the quarter marker, drew off in the stretch run and was hand urged to the wire as much the
best. DANNY MICHAEL bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, was allowed to settle, saved ground to the second turn, was no match for the winner
in the stretch run and stayed on to be best of the rest. TAM'S TIME tracked the decent early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, lost
ground while three wide nearing the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch, offered a mild late rally and was up for show in the final strides. QUE
SERA SIR RALPH was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the decent fractions to the half-mile marker, challenged LUCK IS GOLDEN nearing the
quarter marker, was repelled in that bid, chased LUCK IS GOLDEN to mid-stretch, weakened in the final furlong and was outfinished for show. LOVE OF
THE SPORT tracked the decent early pace between runners, was well placed into the far turn and did not offer a rally in the drive. THE LONNA RANGER
was a bit rank into the first turn, settled along the backstretch run, raced outside of rivals into the far turn, lost ground while widest nearing the quarter
marker and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
JEWELED SHILLELAGH unhurried into the first turn, raced three wide into the backstretch run and advanced while outside of runners approaching the
half-mile marker, confronted KIT KAT MAN nearing the quarter pole, battled with that rival to mid-stretch, dueled outside of KIT KAT MAN to deep stretch
while kept to steady urging and determinedly won the nod on the wire. KIT KAT MAN away alertly and was sent to establish the early lead, set a pressured
pace into the backstretch run, shook free from MECHANT and set decent fractions to the far turn, was confronted by JEWELED SHILLELAGH nearing the
quarter marker, battled with that rival to mid-stretch, dueled inside of JEWELED SHILLELAGH in the final furlong, was kept to steady urging to deep stretch
and was gamely bested in the final strides, while holding safely in the end for the place. EL BROMISTA allowed to settle in the early stages, advanced
leaving the first turn, was keen and hard to place while between rivals along the backstretch run, raced three wide to the quarter marker, chased the dueling
top pair in the drive, lacked a late response and was well clear for show in the end. G'S LAST CHANCE took back off of the early pace, advanced along the
backstretch run and was well placed into the second turn, saved ground to the quarter marker and could not muster a late rally. MECHANT hustled to be
forwardly placed in the early stages, pressed the pacesetter into the backstretch run, kept attendance to KIT KAT MAN through decent fractions to the
half-mile marker, dropped back nearing the far turn, was eased through the stretch run and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
CINDERELLAS PRINCE raced just off of the early pace while under a snug hold, chased the pace to the quarter marker, came in a bit tight nearing the top
of the lane and tipped four wide into the stretch run, closed fast inside of the furlong marker, confronted GENTLEMAN'S SECRET inside of the
sixteenth-marker, wore down that foe in the final strides and determinedly won the nod on the wire. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET tracked the early speed from
the second flight, advanced outside of rivals into the turn, vied for the lead while three deep nearing the quarter marker, raced in hand into the drive, was set
down nearing the eighth pole and assumed command into the final furlong, was confronted by CINDERELLAS PRINCE inside of the sixteenth-marker, met
that bid to the final strides and was denied for the win on the wire, while besting the rest. QUIET CHARM asked to show early speed and was sent to the
early lead, set the pressured pace to the turn, carved out decent fractions to the quarter marker, battled for the lead to mid-stretch, could not keep pace in
the final furlong and just held for show in the final strides. THAT'S BIND BABE chased the solid early pace, came in tight entering the turn and raced in
traffic to the quarter marker, found room in upper stretch, made a mild late rally but was outkicked in the final stages and just missed for the show. MINOSO
away in good order, pressed the solid early pace, raced between rivals on the turn, vied for the lead to the furlong grounds and gave way in the late stages.
TWIRLING DERBY crowded at the start by MINOSO, lacked early speed, saved ground to the quarter marker and was not a factor.

PURPLE NIGHT chased the decent early pace, gained ground on the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, was turned away in upper stretch and lost
ground to VALERIE approaching the furlong pole, re-rallied in deep stretch, reeled in the runner-up inside of the sixteenth-marker and kept to task in a drive
to prevail. VALERIE assumed command leaving the break and sped to a clear early lead heading to the turn, set decent fractions to the quarter marker,
extended the lead nearing the furlong pole, was kept to steady urging inside of the furlong marker, was all out to hold off PURPLE NIGHT nearing the
sixteenth-marker, was caught by the winner in deep stretch and was well clear of the rest. ZARAGOZA stumbled at the start then drifted in and crowded
AWESOME MAUI GIRL leaving the break, chased the decent early pace, raced two wide into the stretch, lost ground nearing the furlong pole, re-rallied in
the late stages, was not able to impact the top two in deep stretch but finished well to be clear for third. TOM'S CHARM bothered leaving the break by
AWESOME MAUI GIRL and was off slowly, advanced along the rail on the turn, could not sustain that run in the stretch, raced a bit erratically in the late
stages and tired in the final furlong. AWESOME MAUI GIRL crowded at the start by ZARAGOZA, then bothered TOM'S CHARM in the initial strides and
was away slowly, chased from the rear in the early stages, raced three wide to the quarter marker and did not factor in the drive.

Footnotes
NOT NOW I'M BIZZIE allowed to settle in the early going, maintained position while three wide along the turn, swung four wide for the drive, responded to
steady urging in the final furlong, closed with a rush in deep stretch and kicked away in the final stages to prevail. GETAWAY CHARM broke alertly then
took back to stalk the dueling pacesetters, advanced three wide on the turn, drifted out a path in upper stretch, chased to the furlong marker, could not
match strides with NOT NOW I'M BIZZIE in deep stretch and held for the place. ADJUST THE HEAT crowded at the start by neighboring rivals, recovered
to chase the decent early fractions, saved ground to the quarter marker, gained ground along the rail in the drive, could not make further headway in the
final furlong and finished evenly but was up in time to secure the show. A PERFECT PATH sent in the early going, dueled with MY MOONDANCER through
decent early fractions, shook free of that rival in upper stretch, could not hold off oncoming rivals inside of the furlong marker and weakened in deep stretch.
DIVINE PASSAGE crowded at the start by BOSSY PEGASUS and was off slowly, trailed to the quarter marker, raced two wide into the stretch run and
closed willingly in the final furlong. MY MOONDANCER showed early speed, dueled through decent early fractions with A PERFECT PATH, lost ground to
that rival in upper stretch, remained in contention to the furlong pole and gave way in the final stages. BOSSY PEGASUS ducked in at the start and crowded
neighboring rivals leaving the break, lacked early speed and did not threaten.

Footnotes
STATEFOREST broke alertly, took back to stalk the decent early fractions, chased the pacesetter to the quarter marker, reeled in JACRODRA'S DEVIL
nearing the furlong pole, was confronted by STOIC LUNA nearing the sixteenth-marker, was fully extended to hold off that rival but determinedly held that
one at bay in the final strides to prevail. STOIC LUNA content to settle in the early going, gained ground nearing the half-mile marker, raced four wide on the
far turn, came three wide into the drive, closed to come within aim in mid-stretch, confronted STATEFOREST nearing the sixteenth-marker, continued to
gain on that rival in deep stretch but was held at bay in the final strides, while besting the rest. JACRODRA'S DEVIL broke out at the start, was hustled to be
prominent into the first turn and cleared the field to dictate terms into the backstretch run, set decent fractions to the far turn, extended the lead approaching
the quarter marker, was confronted by STATEFOREST nearing the furlong pole, could not hold off oncoming rivals in the final furlong but held safely in the
end for the show. GEA hard to load prior to the start, was unhurried in the early stages, raced three wide to the quarter marker and made a steady late bid in
the stretch run. TEAM CONCEPT forwardly placed into the first turn, was well placed through the backstretch run while tracking the pace, raced three wide
into the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not produce a late rally. EXACTLY WENDY chased the decent early pace, saved ground to the far turn,
lost position approaching the quarter marker and tired in the drive. BLOSSOMING allowed to settle in the early stages, raced four wide into the backstretch
run, was well placed into the far turn, raced between rivals to the quarter marker, had a bit of traffic entering the stretch, was outrun in the drive and gave
way in the late stages.

Footnotes
MY LEGAL BET tracked the solid early pace while between rivals, floated out ZAKKIYYAH midway through the turn and was roused three wide nearing the
top of the lane, rallied in mid-stretch come within aim, vied for the lead nearing the sixteenth-marker and found more in deep stretch to prove best in the end.
AUTISM INNOCENCE broke out a bit but was away in good order, ceded the early lead to SOMETHINGNEFARIOUS and chased that rival through solid
early fractions, raced two wide to the quarter marker, reeled in the pacesetter nearing the furlong marker, vied for the lead nearing the sixteenth-pole but
could not match strides late with MY LEGAL BET and held on for second. MARY MARGARET chased the decent early pace from the inside, saved ground
to the top of the lane, rallied in mid-stretch, was outkicked in the late stages and was clear for show in the end. SOMETHINGNEFARIOUS was sent to
establish the early lead, sped to a clear advantage into the turn, set solid fractions from the inside into upper stretch, came under pressure nearing the
furlong pole, could not hold off oncoming rivals and weakened in the final furlong. BLUE BREEZE lacked early speed, raced two wide into the turn then was
steered widest approaching the quarter marker, trailed into the stretch run and was not a factor. ZAKKIYYAH crowded a bit at the start by AUTISM
INNOCENCE then continued to drift out at the break and was off a step slowly, chased the solid early pace while outside of rivals, raced three wide into the
turn, was floated out a path nearing the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE unhurried in the early stages, saved ground while trailing into the far turn, mounted a four wide rally into the stretch run, came out
a path and closed five wide inside of the eighth pole, came within aim inside of the sixteenth-marker and kept to task in the final strides to prevail.
UNDISTURBED forwardly placed into the first turn, attended to the modest fractions through the backstretch run, pressed the pacesetter to the quarter
marker, drifted in in upper stretch and made contact with SHEZAGHOST, battled with that rival to deep stretch, was not able to match strides in the final
stages with the winner and won the nod for place on the wire. SHEZAGHOST broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, was well rated through modest
fractions to the half-mile marker, was pressed into the far turn by UNDISTURBED, made contact with that foe in upper stretch, battled with UNDISTURBED
to the final sixteenth, could not hold off the winner in deep stretch and was just edged for place on the wire. REV REE stalked the modest early fractions
from the inside, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, came in tight and encountered traffic in upper stretch, shifted three wide for the drive, closed in
the final furlong and just missed for the minor awards. DRAMATIZER chased the early pace, raced two wide between rivals into the backstretch run,
maintained position while between runners to the far turn, raced three wide into the stretch drive, ran evenly in the final furlong and lacked a late rally.
SIGNORINA MERISI (GB) settled just off of the early pace, raced three wide into the backstretch run, advanced nearing the far turn, was asked for run three
wide into the stretch and did not offer a late response. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING IN UPPER STRETCH. IN A
UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT UNDISTURBED DRIFTED IN IN UPPER STRETCH, BUMPED WITH SHEZAGHOST, AND IN
DOING SO COST SHEZAGHOST THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING. UNDISTURBED WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED
THIRD.

Footnotes
RIO KING bided time at the back of the field for the first half mile, then began a sustained rally from the half mile pole improving position while circling the
field three wide on the far turn, was on the outside of a four horse fan turning for home and rallied strongly under strong urging to win going away in the end.
MIDNIGHT METAL broke well and easily made first run into the turn, set a moderate pace by a measured length or two and kept the lead to the top of the
stretch, was then challenged by by a trio to the outside, was headed by L'ENFANT DIT in mid-stretch, then found another gear and came back on to grab
second. L'ENFANT DIT made light contact with OH GREAT (IRE) at the break then was unhurried and content to sit well off the early pace, pulled the rider
closer to the front down the backstretch, made an eye-catching move through the turn about three wide, turned for home with a share of the lead, was
unable to match strides with RIO KING in the final furlong then lost the second spot to a resurgent MIDNIGHT METAL inside the sixteenth pole. EL JOY
unhurried early, was still well behind with a half-mile to run, was making a nice run through the far turn inside of the eventual winner but ran into a wall of
horses near the quarter pole and had to stall the bid, got some room on the inside near mid-stretch and finished evenly in the final furlong. YOU KIDDING
ME fell back and was outrun through the first turn, having only RIO KING beat at one point, made a little forward progress down the backstretch but was still
last as the field turned for home, swung five wide into the stretch and was making up good ground to the wire but was much too late. OH GREAT (IRE)
broke in a bit and made light contact with L'ENFANT DIT just after the break, tracked from mid-pack early, holding a ground saving position along the rail,
moved into contention from the half mile pole, had a nice inside run through the turn, loomed a threat at the top of the stretch but was unable to find another
gear when needed and ran on one-paced to the wire. STATE OF THE UNION raced on the outside of a trio tracking the two leaders through the clubhouse
turn, moved up into third position as the field went into the far turn, was asked for more near the five sixteenths pole, lost the path then had to wait for room
but had nothing to offer once clear. STORMIN GALILEO broke out and bumped EL JOY while trying to hustle to the front, tracked behind the pacesetter to
the far turn, let that one get away a bit entering the far turn, then made a bid through the turn to challenge for the lead, began to falter past the quarter pole
and was passed on all sides near the three sixteenths marker and dropped back to last.
