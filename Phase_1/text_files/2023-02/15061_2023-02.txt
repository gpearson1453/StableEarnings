Footnotes
CUSTOM PRAYER set the pace in the three path as rivals on either side pressed, cleared while changing leads inside the quarter pole, then tired in the
closing stages, yet lasted safely. GOT ME A CHRYSLER broke slowly, laid off of the pace in the three path, swung five wide while picking up stride entering
the lane, rallied while hanging on his left lead, and closed in belatedly on the tiring leader in the late stages. HAPPY SEASON stalked along the inside,
tugged behind the leaders, remained rank entering the turn, pursued from just off of the fence around the bend, took aim on place in the three path in upper
stretch after the leader kicked clear, bid for that position approaching midstretch, but was outkicked leaving the furlong pole. INSPECTOR ED tracked
between horses while in the three path around the turn, and kept on. REECEMANIA vied for the lead along the inside, but failed to keep pace with his outer
counterpart leaving the quarter pole, and gave way. BUCK DOLL TAYLOR lacked speed five wide, then shied from an inner rival entering the lane, and
weakened. VALID EARLY got a bit crowded between horses while slow into stride, lagged behind in the two path, and never got involved. ROYAL
UNLIMITED pressed the top pair from the four path around the turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead.

Footnotes
COLOR FAST broke a step slowly, trailed along the inside, rallied inside of foes in upper stretch, shifted outside of the leaders at the furlong grounds, and
rallied to strike the front at the wire. CABERTOSS tracked two wide and from between horses, stalked down the backstretch, split the leaders to bid at the
five sixteenths pole, drew clear in upper stretch, but was nailed at the wire by an outer bidder. TRIVISTA tracked along the inside, then chased in the three
path in upper stretch to gain place in the final furlong, but was outkicked late. TIO BLAS lacked speed in the three to four paths, swung five wide entering
the lane, but shied from an inner rival at the furlong grounds, flopped back to his left lead in the aftermath, and leveled off. THE GRAY BLUR pressed in the
five path into the first turn before deciding to tuck inside of the pace setter at the seven furlong pole, inched forward to reach the front approaching the five
furlong marker, showed the way along the inside into the far turn, but was confronted turning for home, headed in upper stretch, and gave way at the furlong
grounds. PLEMMONSTON hopped slightly at the start while off slowly, laid off of the pace in the three to four paths around the first turn, then in the five path
around the far turn, and made little impact. CAP ROCK MINER set the pace while intentionally staying four to five paths off of the inside into the first turn,
got headed by an inner rival approaching the five furlong grounds, stalked into the far turn, but weakened in the three path and between horses at the five
sixteenths pole, and was eased through the final furlong. BLURT prompted the pace in the six path, stalked in the four path into the far turn, but faded
between horses entering the lane before being eased.

rail in the second turn and was asked at the quarter pole where she was drivin hard for and eighth of a mile and wrapped up after securing the win. LADY
WITH A CAUSE was allowed to settle at the back of the field while still in contact, was asked to start moving at the half mile marker, split horse at the three
eighths pole where she started to pass foes in the 3 path, ran gamely down the stretch but could not catch the leader today and was second best.
MISCHIEVOUS GAL was placed just of the leaders hip on the outside early, tugged at bit down the back stretch while being rated, was in contention in the
second turn, was kept on point and driven down the lane with sites on passing the leader but couldn't get there and faded late. JAYLA was placed mid pack
along the rail, was let out around the three eighths pole, drifted out late and tired. BELLA PALOMA broke out at the start, went wide through out, was sent at

Footnotes
STEALING APRIORITY stalked the top pair from the three path, chased in upper stretch, bid at the furlong grounds, drove clear soon after, and lasted from
an outer oncharging foe late. DIALED A DAME broke slowly, trailed two wide, moved out to the four to five path while advancing in upper stretch, rallied to
gain place in the closing stages, but was too late to reel in the leader. IRONMAN RICHIE dueled for the lead inside of a rival, but was outkicked by a bidding
foe at the furlong grounds, and gave way. PLANTERS PUNCH took a minor bump from an inner rival at the start, dueled two wide, but was outkicked by an
outer bidder at the furlong grounds, and weakened. MASQUERADE BALL bumped an outer rival at the start and was slow to recover, raced far back along
the inside, and improved between horses in midstretch. MESABI lacked speed in the four path, and faded. SCARYATCANTERBURY chased along the
inside, and faded.

Footnotes
OUR FREDDIE MAC was sharp leaving the gates, moved over to the rail early, was able to set the pace, was never challenged through out the race, was
driven down the lane and finished strong. G'WILDCAT stalked the leader from the second position, was urged to advance around the half mile pole, was
driven hard around the three eighths pole and down the lane but couldn't catch the leader today but was able to place while running gamely. AVAILABLE
STAR was back early, moved up in between horses on the back side in the three path, stayed 3 wide in the turn, swung eight wide out of the turn entering
the lane, was kept to task and was able to out finish other foes while up for show. COHERE was allowed to fall away from the field for the first half of the
race, was asked to run at the half mile pole, responded with a long advancing drive along the rail but had to much to do late and didn't have enough.
BINDING AGREEMENT was off a step slow, was urged to catch up, had to steady a bit while establishing position, was moved in between horses in the
three path, while being asked, responded and improved his position while still being wide, was five wide down the stretch while still gaining ground, drifted
out late and flattened out. JANETS JAY JAY was placed along the rail within striking distance for the first half of the race , was asked to pick it up and
responded through out the turn, started to tire in the lane but was driven hard and was never able to gain on the leaders. SCHNELL was allowed to settle in
the back of the the pack early, was asked to move closer to the leaders from the outside but never rallied.

Footnotes
BEAUXS ARTES prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, led as an outer MAD CAPER menaced entering the lane, got headed by that foe at the
three sixteenths pole, fought back to reclaim an advantage in the final sixteenth, and prevailed gamely. MAD CAPER stalked outside of the top pair, ranged
up entering the lane, led in the five path at the three sixteenths pole, but failed to kick away from an inner game rival, hung, and got outfinished. PLEASE BE
KIND stalked while a bit keen behind the leaders down the backstretch, pursued from the pocket while a bit off of the fence around the turn, took aim inside
of the leading pair nearing midstretch, but only managed to chase evenly through the final furlong. LADY HUXLEY tracked in the three to four path, then
chased evenly from behind the leaders through the lane. CRIMALDI brushed with an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, swung six
wide in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly to miss reaching fourth. CATWINGS came out at the start, set the pace inside of the eventual winner, got
headed entering the lane, and yielded in midstretch. LITTLE FAIRY was lathered in sweat in the post-parade, brushed an outer foe at the start, and showed
little.

Footnotes
BLISSFUL tracked two to three wide, bid in the five path in upper stretch, dueled through midstretch, gained an advantage at the sixteenth pole, and drew
clear. AIN'T BROKE stalked two wide, pressed down the backstretch, bid for the lead entering the lane as an outer rival loomed a danger, led at the three
sixteenths pole, gamely clung to an advantage through midstretch, but was headed by her outer counterpart at the sixteenth pole, gave way, and saved
place late. CECILITA laid off of the pace three wide, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, and rallied outside of rivals to miss reaching place.
LOLLOPING saved ground while tracking, pursued from the three to four paths in upper stretch, and chased evenly through the final furlong.
WAYWARDNESS saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. LIVY B tuned her head just before the gates sprung and came out a length slow, then trailed
in the two path, and never got involved. WORLD WAR set the pace along the inside, shifted out to the three path while meeting a pair of bids in upper
stretch, got headed at the three sixteenths pole, and gave way. LADY EMILY lacked speed in the two to four paths, and never got involved.

Footnotes
UNWANTED INTRUDER settled off of the pace, tracked from the two path around the far turn, split rivals four wide entering the lane to launch a rally, and
drove past the leader at the sixteenth pole. C'MON VE set the pace, showed the way from an outer bidder around the far turn, shook free in upper stretch,
but was outkicked at the sixteenth pole. MY GUITAR tracked from midpack two wide, stalked along the inside around the far turn, then chased the leaders
while holding show. GALLANT STAR tracked three wide, chased around the far turn, sustained pursuit five wide while hanging on his left lead through the
lane, and missed reaching show. PRAY IDE SING stalked two wide, bid in the three path around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader while
hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, and weakened between horses at the furlong pole. LOUISIANA MOON settled far back, advanced four wide around
the far turn, but flattened out turning for home. I'M D'CAT made little impact from the three path. ADIEU LE CHAT lacked speed in the three path and failed
to factor. SHAE'S DAY lagged behind and never got involved. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU stalked along the inside, but wilted around the far turn. DONNA'S
COURT pursued from midpack four wide, but weakened into the far turn.
