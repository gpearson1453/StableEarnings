Footnotes
GHOSTINYOU raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the second bend,
launched a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground to get up for the win late. SHIMMERING LIGHT saved ground around the first turn, led the field
up the backstretch, continued to show the way racing in the two path around the turn and was caught in the final strides after drifting out in the last furlong.
NIP OF BOURBON chased the leader on the outside through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the two path and kept on to the wire.
WATCH FOR THE LUTE raced in the four path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a
bid from the three path coming around the far turn and finished evenly. MAPACHE G raced off the pace in the two path around the first turn and up the
backstretch, continued around the second bend in the three path and gained ground mildly in the lane. THEJIGISUP saved ground around the first turn,
raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the four path and was outkicked in the lane. MACHO REAL angled over to
save ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, navigated the far bend from the two path and was not a threat. DIVINE CONTROL
saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, swung out to the three path for the run around the far turn and made
no bid. GABBYS BIG NOTION raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, dropped back to trail the field while saving ground

Footnotes
AWESOME PIC bumped mildly with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three
path coming around the turn and drew off in the lane, much the best. ASTONISHING ANABEL stalked the pacesetters from the rail through the opening
quarter of a mile, saved ground around the bend and chased the winner home in the stretch, no match for that rival. FLAG WOMAN raced off the pace
between horses early, saved ground around the turn and improved position in the lane. BELMAR SUMMER veered in a bumped with the horse to her
outside at the start, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the two path and finished evenly. GEMMA'S CURLS
bumped with the horses to both sides leaving the gate, recovered to lead the way up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the bend, gave
way entering the stretch and tired further late. FINAL EPISODE raced off the pace on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and made no bid.

Footnotes
AUDREY saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around
the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held that margin to the finish. GIRL PRO raced in the five path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the
outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the second bend and chased the winner home in the lane. DISCO QUEEN raced
in the five path early, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path racing around the second
turn and kept on to the wire. BLUSHING KEYLEN bumped lightly with the horse to his inside at the start, recovered to press the pace from the three path
through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the two path and weakened in the lane. BRYCENS GOLD raced in the two path around the
first turn, led the way on the inside up the backstretch, gave way and drifted out to the four path coming off the far turn and faded from there. HOLLYWOOD
HONEY bumped mildly with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first bend, tracked the leader on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and tired in the stretch. MAY BEAU raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening half
mile, navigated the far bend from the two path and showed no kick. J'S STAR JET bumped with the horses to either side at the break, raced in the four path
around the first turn, chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the far turn and was empty from
there. A FOOLISH FANCY trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path
and was not a factor.
