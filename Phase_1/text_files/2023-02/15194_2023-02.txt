Footnotes
LILY PAD LAKE Led along the rail from the outset in a line of three, opened up on two outside challengers in the run around the bend commencing at the
quarter pole, extended lead from eighth pole to wire in a convincing victory. IGO Broke best, vied between rivals up backstretch, attempted to stick with
eventual winner to the top of the home stretch, pursued throughout lane, no match. MISS MY MAMMA Pressed three wide in backstretch run, called upon at
the three-sixteenths while travelling the widest of the three early speeds, urged yet finished up evenly in the four path. DUKE CITY KITTY Taken ahold of
between in opening stages, pressed along by rider at the quarter pole yet idled against commands, found best stride in final two hundred yards, showed
strong late headway between while passing two tiring foes. L'ARACHIDE Tracked in the second flight of runners in the three path, attempted to threaten at
the quarter pole, chased down the stretch, tired. LITTLEQUEENOFMEAN Broke in order but shied soon after the start as the field progressed past the
backstretch chute, recovered to maintain contact with field while still in rear, advanced at three-eighths pole in the form of a mild bid that flattened out
gradually through the homestretch.

Footnotes
LOST THE MINISTER Was unable to save ground in run to the first turn and ended up in the six path, tracked widest of all rivals as backstretch loomed,
commenced a four wide bid while travelling in hand at the quarter pole, fought willingly deepest of a three horse stretch run, lifted in the final hundred yards,
powered through wire. RED HOT CAT Could not tuck in, forced five wide into the first turn, moved up to challenge for the lead two wide in the four path at
the seven-sixteenths pole, sustained bid three wide in run around turn, battled between, made a brief lead at the sixteenth pole that was short live as he was
outfinished by the eventual winner. OMACHE KID Checked slightly between in run to first turn, recovered quickly to sit just in behind dueling leaders, moved
up three wide at the seven-sixteenths pole, commenced three wide while still in the second flight at the quarter pole, fully found top gear at the sixteenth
pole, picked up well for show. EMPEROR'S CHOICE Worked hard to get over, eventually set up two wide while dueling for the lead, fully assumed lead at
the three-eighths pole, soon joined at the five-sixteenths pole by rival outside while still fending off inside rival, finally cleared to lead and the rail at the
quarter pole, opened up a shortly lived lead at the eighth pole, run down by closing foes at the sixteenth pole, had nothing left late. SHELBY R. Led from the
outset, joined by a rival outside at the seven-sixteenths pole, conceded lead while still holding the rail at the three-eighths pole, switched to the two path at
the three-sixteenths pole for an attempted rebid, flattened out down the stretch. ROLL OUT Saved ground in a pocket in first turn run, travelled in same spot
before being sent at the quarter pole, was all dressed up with nowhere to go while stuck behind rival in front and outside from one hundred-fifty yards out to
the wire. W. WHITEHOUSE Taken ahold of early, always travelled on the rail, never a factor. TROPHY CHEST Was a touch slow from the blocks, moved
two wide in rear on the first turn, maintained position, shifted well out to the five path on the second turn, never really involved.

TIME TO ZOOM Quickly assumed between rivals shortly after the break, opened up a clear advantage at the quarter pole, shook home on the wrong lead
while striding home convincingly. KING LEBRON Moved up along the rail to battle for the early lead, was outsprinted by TIME TO ZOOM as field wielded
into the far turn, chased that rival all the way to the wire. TAKE CHARGE DEPUTY Taken back inside while watching duel unfold, commenced rail rally at
the quarter pole, flew home inside for minor awards. SAN GIORGIO Travelled in the five path in backside run, circled three wide into the turn, presented a
mild belated gain. TIZ A SPEED BOMB Three wide dueling for early lead, outrun in move to the turn, taken to the rail at the three-sixteenths pole, gave way
stretch. CURRENTLY KRAZY Tracked off the lead, moved three wide into the turn, moved further out to pass tiring, eventually well out in center of track for
stretch, ran moderately down lane. EPIC ADVENTURE Was away extremely sharply but was then surely outrun by inside trio who went on to duel, dropped
back between horses at the quarter pole, faded.

HUGHIE'S HOLIDAY Pinched slightly at the start, taken back and moved to the rail for first turn run, took advantage of preceding foe on rail getting out in
run, snuck through in an aggressive move to challenge for the lead at the seven-sixteenths pole, dueled inside of rival for majority of race, just kept going.
KIND BUT SHE LIES Settled two wide in first turn run, left rail open for inside rival to come engage at the seven-sixteenths pole, dueled outside until the
eighth pole, fought willingly through stretch, second best. HAYNESPUN Moved four wide into the first turn, settled to track leaders, asked at the quarter pole
in the three path, moved to the rail at the three-sixteenths pole for an inside bid that was thwarted by the top two finishers. PRINCESS SUGEITH Five wide
first turn, never in touch with top three finishers. AWESOME GALAXY Travelled three wide into the first turn, eventually taken back, never involved from that
point and passed one tiring foe. ARCTIC FIRE Set up on rail for run to first turn but became uncomfortable between the pine and rival outside, set up
second flight, never menaced.

up backstretch in the three path, moved to the two path for turn, dove to rail at the eighth pole to challenge leader, was held off by that foe, just held pass
while tiring to wire. FOCUS FIRST Four path into the first turn, settled off the pace, moved up in three path at the three-sixteenths pole, sustained rally
throughout, just missed place. WISHFUL WON Stalked behind leaders first, failed to menace. AUTISM SAVANT Well wide and lagging first, never in
contention, passed tiring. TRIPDOWNMEMORYLANE Missed break, quickly moved up to track inside second turn, asked at the five-sixteenths pole while
moving along the rail, came home evenly. CANT DO THE DANSE Let FIRST COUNT clear off, switched between in run to first turn to duel two wide, failed
