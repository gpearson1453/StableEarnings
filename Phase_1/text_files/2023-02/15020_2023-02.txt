Footnotes
TIME TO CRUISE stalked the duel down the backstretch, advanced three deep on the far turn, wrested command approaching the stretch and drew out
under brisk urging. COLLECTION DAY disputed the pace racing along the inner rail, steadied in narrow quarters approaching the quarter pole, swung
outside in upper stretch and rallied. CHELONIAN dueled outside COLLECTION DAY and weakened the final furlong. BLOWN SAVE , three wide the far
turn, had a mild advance to the stretch and failed to sustain the move. NOBLE PRENDERGAST , outrun, was three wide leaving the far turn. HE'S ON FIRE
, along the inner rail most of the trip, retreated. An objection by the rider of COLLECTION DAY against the winner for alleged interference leaving the far
turn was not allowed.

Footnotes
UNCAPTURED STORM rated close up while between rivals early, dropped in around the turn and had aim on the embattled leaders, slipped through along
the rail to challenge soon into lane, spurted out to a clear advantage past the three sixteenths then eagerly widened under a solid drive. STARDUST ZIGGY
stalked three deep early on, was patiently handled mid turn, shifted out four wide for the drive, moved up to loom, could not go with the winner past the three
sixteenths but kept on willingly to be well clear of the rest. FUN LOVIN CRIMINAL lagged well back into the turn and saved some ground, swung six wide
under a ride into the stretch, straightened and churned on to get past tired rival. THTWASTHENTHISISNW drifted in at the break, corrected and moved up
towards the inside to stalk, came three wide for the drive, failed to kick on under pressure leaving the quarter pole and gave way. FREDDYNESS sped to
the early lead, set the pace off the rail, took outside pressure into and around the turn, ceded the lead entering the lane and faltered leaving mid stretch.
THENCOMEMORNING shadowed FREDDYNESS three wide, moved to near even terms mid turn, dueled on a slim lead into the stretch, was overtaken
from his inside near the three sixteenths then tired. SOUTHERN LAD , rank leaving the chute, settled past the three quarter pole, made a three to four wide
run mid turn, angled out some into the lane, lacked a punch past the quarter pole and faltered.

Footnotes
OMO DADA prompted the pace outside VAX A NATION, secured command near the three eighths pole, eagerly pulled away and was under some hand
urging in upper stretch before being relaxed late. VAX A NATION set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead on the far turn and gave way through the
stretch. HOME SCHOOL , a forward factor along the inner rail, chased the pace for six furlongs then weakened. SNACK , three wide both turns, chased the
pace to the stretch and weakened. IMAGINE IT , four wide the far turn, was not a factor. REAL RAMBO raced between horses most of the trip and was
steadied in close quarters near the eighth pole.

Footnotes
BIGMANCAN broke sharply then was allowed to draft back off of a quick pace, remained under patient handling past the five sixteenths, shifted out six wide
into the lane, leveled off under asking in mid stretch, rolled by from the outside in deep stretch and drew clear with something left. ROMINSKI broke inward
and bumped with a rival, corrected and advanced three wide into the turn, tracked a contested pace, circled four wide into the stretch, moved up steadily
then bid between rivals with a sixteenth to go, could not match strides with the winner but kept on with interest. QUICK TEMPO sped to the front, set the
pace towards the rail, took pressure leaving far turn, dueled under a hearty ride into the lane, held a tenuous advantage past mid stretch then weakened
very late. PIT STOP MAN sat just outside the leader into the turn, moved to the attack mid turn, sparred in the three path into the lane, fought on between
runners past mid stretch then faded. MONTAUK DADDY , bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace, eased out in the drive but failed to seriously kick
on through the final furlong.

Footnotes
OROCOVIX , off the pace behind horses entering the turn, swung five deep leaving the turn, drifted in near the eighth pole, closed and was up late.
STELLWAGEN BANKER prompted the pace two wide around the turn, gained the lead turning for home, opened a clear advantage in mid stretch and gave
way grudgingly. BEST CHOICE BABY saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, moved to the two path turning for home, raced inside horses in the drive
and flattened out. ELUSIVE IMAGE , reluctant to load into the starting gate, raced in the three path on the turn, swung five wide in upper stretch and failed
to menace. DANNY'S WINKSTER circled foes around the turn, turned for home in the four path and weakened the final furlong. DUKE OF DOOLY showed
speed along the inner rail and gave way the final furlong. LUNAR GHOST trailed.

Footnotes
LUCKY LORRAINE drafted back early on, picked up some steam when coaxed along leaving the far turn, advanced to the inside of a rival and angled out
five wide entering the lane, straightened away and made a grinding run under a drive, drew alongside HOV LANE near the sixteenth marker, sparred then
edged away some late. HOV LANE , with the pace three deep, moved to apply more pressure while still in hand past the three eighths, pressed, took over
past the quarter pole, opened up under stout handling in mid stretch, swerved outward from left handed asks, corrected and dug in when collared then gave
way grudgingly to the inside of the winner. TORRE BRANCA lagged off the pace while saving some ground, was under asking around the turn, shifted out
past the three sixteenths and got going too late. BACKSTREET AFFAIR rated close up off the leading trio, awaited room towards the inside in upper stretch,
came out near mid stretch to advance, altered back in but flattened out late. NIBBLES disputed the pace along the rail, kept on to the inside of a pair of
rivals entering the lane, failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and faded. MARTHARITA , off the pace, raced three wide into the lane, shifted in and
failed to respond. EARLEY ROSE , in the clear while within range, came under pressure four wide while making some progress mid turn, was fanned five
wide entering the stretch and faded. BAD TEMPER was sent up between rivals leaving the three quarter pole and entertained the pace, battled on a slim
lead into the lane then tired through the final furlong.

AL LOVES JOSIE sprinted clear leaving the backstretch, was slightly off the rail around the turn, opened up in upper stretch and responded to intermittent
urging in the drive. MR. HUSTLE , inside horses around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and closed nicely. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY ,
checked in tight quarters along the inner rail near the four and a half furlongs pole, saved ground on the turn and rallied gamely inside horses. SEVIER ,
three deep chasing the winner around the turn, gave way the final furlong. GERRYS GEM , up close leaving the backstretch, raced in the three path on the
turn and gave way in upper stretch. TREASURE TRADITION , no factor, was four wide leaving the turn. IT'S SIZZLING TIME hugged the inner rail around
the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
TAPPIN JOSIE , brushed at the break, steadied back off foes nearing the five eighths, regrouped and gained off the rail leaving mid turn, knifed her way four
wide between foes to challenge entering the lane, battled between rivals leaving the eighth pole, wrested command about a sixteenth late and was edging
away under a steady hand ride. HAPPY CLOUDS , taken to rate off the contested pace, angled out leaving the far turn, ranged up six wide outside rivals
into the lane, moved to a slim advantage in mid stretch, dueled outside the winner through the final sixteenth and gave way grudgingly. LIQUIDATOR , well
placed inside and in range of the duel, eased out and bid three wide to command near the quarter pole, fought on to the inside of foes in mid stretch then
faded. NAVAL EMPIRE stumbled at the break then steadied when in tight, regrouped and raced well back into the turn, came three wide for the drive and
churned on. MAJESTY'S FREEDOM , urged along chasing the duelers, was guided out some and bid five wide between runners after a half, failed to
quicken with the leaders leaving the the three sixteenths then gave way grudgignly. GAVINERA rushed up early and grabbed command, sparred to the
inside of STRYDA, could not resist foes after a half and gave way. STRYDA disputed the pace outside GAVINERA, failed to go on nearing the lane and
faltered.
