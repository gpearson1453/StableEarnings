Footnotes
IRON WILMA stalked the early pace, moved up near the rail around the far turn through the stretch and finished well to be clear late under strong pressure.
SOULSTONE was rushed from the inside to set the early pace, raced just off the inside in the lane and was no match for the winner late to finish second
best. LEMONSANDDIAMONDS settled off the early going, moved up four wide through the stretch and kept on willing to the wire. FRANCIA (PER) stalked
the pace, made a strong two wide bid near the five sixteenths pole, angled out to raced well off the inside in the drive and raced evenly late. DANCING FOR
MONEY was off slowly, raced wide into the upper stretch, shifted in through the stretch and never was a serious threat. I MATTER was off a step slow, void
of early speed, raced near the inside and never menaced. ADRIANA ES BONITA was coaxed along early and faded.

Footnotes

Footnotes
ATTUCK showed good early foot to set the early pace, raced off the inside in the stretch run and held gamely to be clear under strong handling. NYOMAN
forwardly placed to lay up close, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, angled out to race from the outside in the lane, surged late and finished gamely to
the wire. ARAZI LIKE MOVE dropped back early on, raced four to three wide and gained ground well late to improve position. ARTIE MY BOY stalked the
pace, made a three wide bid near the quarter pole and flattened out. KREWE CHIEF was void of early speed, raced five to six wide around the far turn and
never threatened while racing from the outside. CALL PAPA was slow early on, raced three to four wide and had no late rally. SILVER G T O dropped back
early and failed to respond. TOO LEGIT failed to sustain a bid.

good early speed from the inside to set the pace and weakened. IMTHEPRINCE dropped back early, raced near the inside around the far turn through the

TEMPLE TITAN showed good early speed to set the pace, raced in hand down the backstretch, raced well clear in the stretch and was much the best while
racing in hand. BOURBON TEDDY stalked the pace, raced two to three wide and was no match for the winner. TWICE AS SMART settled off the early
going, made an advance through the far turn, raced near the inside in the drive and had not enough for the top pair. CHROMED IMPULSE race mid pack
early, was near the rail past the quarter pole and had no final winning bid. PERFECT PICTURE dropped back early, swung seven deep into the upper
stretch and had not enough. KAPHAVATA pressed early and gave way. RHYTHMIC RULER mid pack early stages, raced two to three wide and had no
response. JUSTINSPEIGHTOFIT was unhurried early on and showed little. WHO CAN WIN void of early speed and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SHUTUPANDSHAKEIT showed good early speed to set the early pace and held gamely to be well clear under strong handling. LOVE'S TAVITO settled off
the early going, moved up from the far outside in the stretch and got up for the place position. PISTOLPACKINPOLLY stalked the pace from the outside,
raced seven wide into the upper stretch and kept on to the wire. HATTIE M dropped back early, raced from the inside through the stretch run and moved up
to improve position. LADY GIULIANA raced three wide nearing the quarter pole, angled out to race wide and never threatened. CURIOSITY KILLS stalked
the pace, raced four to five wide through the far turn and weakened. UNDERCOVER LADY chased the pace while racing three wide and faded.
DATTTSAFANCYFOX pressed the pace from the inside and gave way.
