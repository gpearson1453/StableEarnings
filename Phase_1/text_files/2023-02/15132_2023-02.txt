for the place spot. MAHOMES MONEY dueled two wide for command, dueled on the turn, dug in between rivals in the stretch drive and then weakened.
POSITIVELY AWESOME dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn and tired in the stretch. GUSHING OIL was outrun.

Footnotes
COLES CONUNDRUM tracked in the early stages, moved up two wide to contest the pace, dueled two wide on the turn, put a head in front, dug in gamely
outside of TATUM through a long stretch drive and edged away late. TATUM set the pace racing with a clear early lead, then vied inside, dueled inside of
the winner on the turn, dug in gamely on the rail in the stretch and battled on willingly through the final furlong. ONE BITE raced off the pace inside,
advanced inside on the turn, rallied mildly in the lane but failed to threaten the top pair. KAIQUE stalked close up outside in the early stages, then chased
three wide and tired. FIRST TO LAST raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor.

Footnotes
LARGE was off a bit slow, recovered quickly and moved up inside to contest the pace, took over, shook free on the turn, cruised into the stretch, responded
when roused nearing the furlong marker and was kept to the task. TRUE DAKOTAN raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the turn, angled out for the
drive, rallied, finished well but second best. FORMAL ORDER raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up three wide, then four wide on the turn, rallied outside
and closed well for third. MUSK steadied at the start, raced off the pace, moved up three or four wide on the turn and rallied mildly outside. BIRD RULER
raced two wide off the pace, chased inside on the turn and lacked a rally. HORSE BE WITH YOU chased three wide, chased on the turn and weakened.
ROCKIN FREEBEE veered in at the break and was off slowly, raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. EXPLAIN was off a bit slow, trailed the field
on the inside and did not factor. CRISTIANO'S DREAM vied for the early lead, then chased close up two wide, chased on the turn and faded. I SAW IT ALL
raced three wide off the pace and gave way.
