WOW WOW ITS MAGIC pressed the pace from the outside of foe and finished well to prevail under strong handling. MOONSHINE LILY showed good early
foot to set the pace along the inside, shifted out three wide through the upper stretch and finished gamely to the wire. CHARACTER COUNTS stalked the
pace along the inside, raced two to three wide in the lane and kept on to the wire. HAPPY QUEST was forced out, checked around the first turn due to
boring out rival, lost a considerable amount of ground and never threatened. SURE WASN'T ME bore out around the first turn and was pulled up.

SOUTHERN SMOKE dueled for the early lead from the inside, drifted late and prevailed under all out pressure. MONTEREY PENINSULA chased the early
pace, moved up three wide around the far turn and finished willingly to the wire. Jockey of Monterey Peninsula claimed objection for interference in the
stretch run and stewards ruled no change. LUCKY MCCOY dropped back early, moved up three to four wide through the stretch run and improved position.
STAN THE CAMERAMAN dueled outside of foe and weakened in the drive. STREET RINGER raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a
factor. SUPER SIZER dropped to the back of the pack early on and failed to respond.

LUCKY EVERY DAY showed good early foot from the inside to set the early pace and held gamely to be clear under strong handling. READY TO GET
LOUD was coaxed along throughout while racing just off the inside and was no match for the winner. GIGGLES AND SMOKE dropped back early, moved
up from the inside and improved position. STERN raced mid pack early on, was near the inside and had no final bid. SOYBEAN was hustled along and
weakened. BIND ME UP was void of speed and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MAYZEE was quick to begin and held safe under steady handling. P R ODDS SETTER chased the early pace setter and held the place position while
racing two to three wide. JUDGE ON THE RUN stalked the top trio, moved up four wide through the lane and was closing in late. INEWAGALLIKETHAT
was hustled along, raced near the inside and had not enough in the drive. QUEENSCABALLO raced four wide around the far turn and no closing run.
ZIBBY TOO was off slowly, raced near the inside and never threatened. LOVESAFLYIN was hustled along from the inside and failed to threaten. JOY
FOREVER failed to respond.
