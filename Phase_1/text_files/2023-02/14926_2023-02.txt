Footnotes
MAX SWAGGER settled off the early pace two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, closed outside, seized command nearing the sixteenth pole
and edged ahead under a drive. RIGEL prompted the pace two wide around the first turn, angled in on the backstretch, was under constant urging from
there, came through inside of the pacesetter in midstretch, reached near even terms near the sixteenth pole but was outfinished. ANZIO raced off the pace
two wide, went four wide around the far turn, shifted seven wide in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and rallied widest. LYTE CRUDE
bumped at the start, was up close inside early, rated back down the backstretch, chased two wide around the far turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and
rallied between foes. MACLIN saved ground off the pace, advanced three wide around the far turn, swung six wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly.
MEXICOFFEE set the pace along the rail, drifted slightly in upper stretch and weakened through the final sixteenth. FABLED PRINCE chased the pace
three wide and faded in the drive. LIEUTENANT JACK was bumped at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. HOLLYWOOD CLOSEUP prompted
the pace four wide around the first turn, bid two wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired. MR. PACIFIST was outrun while
racing four wide.

Footnotes
DIGNIFIED raced prominently in the four path, ranged up in the three path under coaxing around the turn and bid while floating out to the six path into the
stretch, sustained that bid and took the lead going into the final sixteenth, and held safe. AWESOME APEAL set the pace in the two path, was roused
around the turn and headed by an outer foe passing the quarter pole, dug in from the four path in the lane and held on to the lead before yielding to the
outer foe inside the final furlong for place. RAIN stalked along the inside into the turn, shifted out to the four path around the turn and was ridden along while
floating out to the eight path entering the stretch, and evened out for show. CAGED PIXIE was held up between foes early in the three path, moved up and
was cued to bid into the turn, was driven along in the five path going into the lane, but faded while drifting in through the stretch. LOVIN LIVIN trailed
throughout around the five path.

Footnotes
LAKOTA TERRITORY slightly bobbled and brushed an inner foe leaving the gate, tracked in the four path, ranged up and was cued passing the quarter
pole, took aim from the seven path under a drive into the lane, bid and brushed with an inner foe passing the eighth pole, dueled with that foe to the wire,
and edged past late to win. A LA CARTE had an awkward start, raced prominently in the three path into the turn, bid passing the quarter pole and was
roused in the five path while taking the lead at the top of the lane, angled out to meet the challenge of an outer foe and brushed with that foe passing the
eighth pole, dug in and dueled to the wire but was edged out late to place. CITIZEN MACK was coaxed along and trailed in the three path into the turn, was
driven from the four path into the stretch, and kept on under left handed urging for show. JONAS' DREAM brushed with an outer foe leaving the gate, set
the pace in the two path, was roused when headed passing the quarter pole, but yielded in the stretch. TEN EXTRA chased in the five path, tipped in to the
two path around the turn, but was no menace in the four path in the stretch. ZAKHARI broke well but was hustled along while dropping off the pace in the
four path, shifted inside into the turn, but was empty while floating out to the center in the stretch.

Footnotes
RIVETING SPIRIT stalked the pace from the rail, tipped two wide near the quarter pole, moved to the front in midstretch, drifted out under left-handed urging
and held safe. TAMARINDO saved ground off the pace, swung three wide in upper stretch and rallied widest. JUDGE JUDITH broke a bit awkwardly,
steadied along inside, checked near the five-sixteenths pole, made good progress cutting the corner into the lane, angled out nearing the eighths pole and
rallied between foes. MIA CAMILA set a rated pace inside, was collared near the eighth pole and weakened. PRETTYKEEN settled off the pace two wide,
angled four wide nearing the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN chased the pace two wide and faded nearing the lane.
SPEED SALSA pressed the pace two wide and faltered nearing the quarter pole. NANA FANNY broke a bit awkwardly, raced three wide in midpack, bid
three deep rounding the far turn but came up empty in the lane.

TAPE TO TAPE set the pace in the two path, was cued from the three path at the top of the lane, opened up while angling back to the two path, and was
kept to task. SOUPER SUCCESS stalked along the inside, was roused between foes in the three path around the turn, and kept on in the five path in the
stretch for place. CITY DRIFTER was prompted along while up close in the three path, was driven from the six path into the stretch, and stayed on for show.
FOREST SURVIVOR chased in the two path, shifted out around the turn and was urged from the seven path into the lane, but was one paced. NO ANGEL
trailed in the two path early, swung out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but was no factor. HE'S IN CHARGE raced off the pace inside, tipped out
around the turn and was driven from the four path into the lane, but was no threat.

Footnotes
RHYMES LIKE DIMES settled off the pace outside, cruised up three wide around the turn, seized command leaving the quarter pole and drew off under a
drive. ASTROTURF lacked early speed outside, raced four wide around the turn and ran on for the place. SOVEREIGN OF SPEED chased the pace three
wide, was no match for the winner but churned on to gain the show. CHARMING CHARLIE saved ground and failed to menace. SARAWAT was outrun
inside. LEE ANN'S WARRIOR bobbled at the break, quickly recovered to lead down the chute, chased the runaway pacesetter two wide down the
backstretch and around the far turn and came up empty in the lane. ENSIGN PARKER set a fast pace in the two path and faltered nearing the quarter pole.
LORD JAXSTON hit the starting gate, raced four wide and never threatened. ROYAL KITTEN was through early, pulled in deep stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
SIX MINUS raced in midpack in the three path, was cued around the final turn, ranged up and tipped out to the five path into the stretch, took the lead into
the final furlong, and drew clear while drifting out under left handed urging. MODERN SCIENCE (IRE) was held up in the three path, tipped out around the
final turn and was ridden from the six path into the lane, and ran on for place. EXPERIENCED tracked in the two path, shifted out and was roused from the
five path turning into the stretch, and kept on for show. SO HIGH (GB) was keen while up close along the inside early, was urged from the four path into the
lane, and evened out late. INFLATION ADJUSTED stalked in the two path, was ridden in the three path turning into the stretch, but flattened. SHADIZAAR
trailed in the two path early, moved up under a ride around the final turn and swung out to the seven path into the lane, and improved late but was no factor.
SURROGATE bumped with an outer foe at the start, was unhurried along the inside but never threatened. HOKU set the pace along the inside but yielded
entering the stretch. PRIDEOFDISTINCTION rated in the two path but never menaced. ASSIDUOUSLY (GB) bumped with an inner foe leaving the gate,
was hard held while in range from the three path early, but gaveway abruptly around the final turn. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
MISS M M saved ground in range, tipped two wide near the quarter pole, angled back to the rail in midstretch, seized command nearing the sixteenth pole
and drove clear. CHLOE'S TOY hit the starting gate, advanced two wide down the backstretch, dueled two wide around the turn, put away the pace rival in
upper stretch, was collared near the sixteenth pole and stayed on to hold second. CAMILLA veered out at the start and slammed TOVIA into TURN ON THE
CHARM, saved ground off the pace, swung five wide in upper stretch and rallied for the show. BEAUTY DESTINY stalked the pace three wide and was
one-paced through the lane. RECONNECTING raced off the pace four wide, checked in upper stretch and never threatened. WOLF RAYET chased the
pace four wide and five and lacked the needed rally. TURN ON THE CHARM was bumped at the start and made little impact while racing three wide. PINK
PARTY PANTS dueled at the rail to upper stretch and tired. TOVIA was slammed between foes and taken up at the start, raced two wide and played no
factor.
