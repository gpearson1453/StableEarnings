Footnotes
GRIGORO allowed to settle in the early going, advanced two wide on the far turn, continued that steady bid into the stretch run, came within aim of
FANTASTIC SECRET nearing the furlong marker, battled with the runner-up into deep stretch and kept to task in the final stages to prevail. COCOA CENTS
broke alertly, ceded the early lead to FANTASTIC SECRET and stalked that rival through moderate fractions, lost ground to FANTASTIC SECRET on the
far turn, re-rallied in the drive, split foes in mid-stretch, had a narrow lead in deep stretch but was outfinished in the final stages and was second best.
FANTASTIC SECRET showed early speed and was sent to establish the early advantage, cleared the field into the first turn and set moderate fractions to
the half-mile marker, drew to a clear lead approaching the quarter pole, came under pressure nearing mid-stretch, could not hold off the top two late and just
held for third in the final strides. DANGEROUS ILLUSION raced just off of the early pace, settled along the backstretch run, raced two wide into the stretch,
mounted a mild late bid in the final furlong and just missed for show. ALESHA forwardly placed in the early stages, lost position while saving ground along
the backstretch run, maintained that rail trip to the quarter pole, angled out in the stretch run and offered a mild late rally. ROSE PRINCESS hopped at the
start and was off a step slowly, rushed up along the first turn and chased the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, lost ground on the far turn and did not
offer a late rally. NICOLE GRACE lacked early speed, settled through the backstretch run, lost contact nearing the quarter pole and could not muster a late
response.

Footnotes
SYNNIN AND WINNIN broke in good order and assumed command in the early stages, set moderate fractions to the turn, was confronted by WAKES AND
WEDDINGS nearing the quarter pole, quickened in upper stretch to dispose of that rival and drew off under steady hand urging in the final stages. WAKES
AND WEDDINGS was forwardly placed in the early going and stalked the moderate fractions while outside of SYNNIN AND WINNIN, advanced on the
pacesetter nearing the quarter pole, could not keep pace with SYNNIN AND WINNIN when that one quickened in upper stretch but stayed on in the late
stages and just held for the place. WHISPER AND WINK chased the moderate early fractions, was a bit hard to handle on the turn while three wide and
trying to get out, could not keep pace with the winner in the stretch and was outfinished in the final strides for the place. MOVIETIME was unprepared at the
start then ducked in leaving the gate and was off slowly, rushed up heading into the turn, chased from the inside to the top of the lane and tired in the
stretch.

Footnotes
MURPHYS TIGER took a stalking position in the early stages, kept attendance to the fast pace to the quarter marker, raced three wide into the stretch,
closed in mid-stretch, caught HONEYMOONZ OVER inside of the sixteenth-marker, matched strides with TORPEDO AWAY to deep stretch and
determinedly won the nod on the wire to prevail. TORPEDO AWAY tracked the fast early pace, advanced two wide on the turn, swung four wide into the
stretch drive, rallied inside of the furlong marker, matched strides with MURPHYS TIGER to deep stretch but could not get by the determined winner and
just missed for the win, while securing the place. HONEYMOONZ OVER broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set fast fractions through the turn,
extended the lead into upper stretch, was asked for more inside of the furlong marker, could not hold off the top pair in deep stretch and held for show in the
final stages. SEATTLE BOLD disputed the early pace then took back to chase the fast fractions into the turn, chased from the rail to the top of the stretch,
stayed in aim to the furlong marker and did not produce a late rally.

Footnotes
MAYCEE JO broke alertly and assumed command in the early stages, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker while carving out decent fractions, shook
free from her stablemate at the top of the lane, was confronted again by CROWN KITTEN inside of the sixteenth-marker and dug in in the final strides to
secure the win. CROWN KITTEN chased the decent early pace, advanced to press her stablemate to the quarter marker, lost ground to MAYCEE JO in
upper stretch, came again inside of the furlong marker, closed well under firm urging in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while besting the rest.
MISS ARROWHEAD chased the decent early fractions, steadied while between runners nearing the half-mile marker, advanced while three wide on the
turn, lost ground in upper stretch, was outkicked in the final furlong and finished evenly in deep stretch, while holding on for show. TAKES A VILLAGE
chased the decent early pace from the inside, lost ground in upper stretch, ran evenly in the final furlong and did not offer a late response. NAN ELIZABETH
bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, lacked early speed, raced three wide into the stretch and did not threaten. HEAT SEEKING LETA took back
off of the decent early pace, saved ground on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
GAYLES EVENING broke sharply and sped to the early lead, set quick fractions to the turn, was well handled through decent fractions to the quarter
marker, drew to a clear lead nearing the furlong pole, switched to the left lead inside of the furlong marker and pulled away in the final stages as much the
best. KITTY'S CANDY chased the early pace, advanced from the rail on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not keep pace with GAYLES EVENING in
the final furlong and held for the place in the final stages. TIGER QUEEN stalked the quick early pace to the turn, kept attendance to GAYLES EVENING
through decent fractions to the quarter pole, was outrun in upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong and held on for show. MIRACLE IN MOTION chased
the decent early pace, raced two wide between runners on the turn, shifted out in upper stretch but was unable to muster the needed late response. GOING
TO SHABOOMS bobbled at the start and was off slowly, lacked early speed, raced two wide into the stretch and did not factor. DAMN THE TORPEDOES
forwardly placed in the early going, chased the quick early pace to the turn, lost position three wide nearing the top of the lane, was outrun in the drive and
was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
REFI NOW forwardly placed in the early stages, raced on a snug hold while tracking the quick pace to the turn, came two wide to the quarter marker, ran in
pursuit of FAST PER SE to mid-stretch, overtook that rival nearing the sixteenth-marker and kicked clear in deep stretch. FAST PER SE was sent to the
early lead, showed good speed while carving out quick fractions to the quarter marker, held foes at bay to mid-stretch, was overtaken by REFI NOW nearing
the sixteenth-marker, drifted in a bit in deep stretch, crowded MCGEORGE and just held for the place. MCGEORGE rated off of the fast early pace, saved
ground to the quarter marker, came in a bit tight entering the stretch, rallied along the rail nearing the furlong pole, could not keep pace with REFI NOW in
deep stretch, steadied in tight quarters inside of the sixteenth-marker and missed for the place, while holding for the show. THUNDER OF ZION shuffled
back at the start and was off slowly, recovered to chase the fast early pace to the turn, raced two wide between rivals into the turn, was boxed in nearing the
quarter marker, swung six wide for the drive and offered mild late rally. AMANOFMYSTATURE chased the fast early pace, raced three wide between
runners into the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and lacked a late rally. PLAYING HARDBALL broke alertly then took back off of the fast early pace,
mounted a four wide bid on the turn, could not sustain that run in the stretch and tired.

PREMIUMONSATURDAY settled off of the early pace while not far back, made a bit of headway to inch closer nearing the half-mile marker, mounted a
three wide bid on the far turn, chased the pacesetter to the furlong pole, overtook AMANDA ROSE inside of the furlong marker, kept to task in deep stretch
and held safely in the end over the oncoming runner-up. TWILIGHT EMPIRE rated off of the modest early pace, came under a snug hold through the
backstretch run, raced two wide while between rivals to the quarter marker, swung three wide into the stretch, closed well inside of the furlong marker, could
not reel in the winner in the final stages and was clear of the rest. SHE'S A BIT SASSY lost her path at the start and was off slowly, was allowed to settle in
the early stages, roused three wide on the far turn, raced four wide into the stretch run, was not able to impact the top pair in deep stretch but rallied in the
late stages to secure the show. AMANDA ROSE prominent in the early stages and assumed command along the first turn, was well rated while setting
modest fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, dug in and held foes at bay to mid-stretch, could not sustain
that effort in deep stretch, gave way and was just edged for the show. COUNCILWOMAN JILLY stumbled leaving the start, recovered and was forwardly
placed into the first turn, stalked the modest fractions through the backstretch run, advanced on the pacesetter along the far turn, dropped back in the
stretch run and tired in the final furlong. BEACHGRASS took back off of the early pace, raced under a tight hold through the backstretch run, remained
under a snug hold heading to the far turn, saved ground to the top of the lane, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not offer a late rally.

Footnotes
KODIACTION was allowed to settle in the early stages, raced two wide between runners into the far turn, came three wide to the quarter marker, was
roused in upper stretch, closed with a rush inside of the furlong marker, came within aim in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail in a blanket
finish. TRIBAL NATION contested the pace leaving the break then ceded the early lead to STONE'S RIVER, tracked that rival through solid early fractions,
made a steady gain on the pacesetter into the far turn, vied for the lead with STONE'S RIVER to mid-stretch, took a narrow lead inside of the furlong pole,
dueled with STONE'S RIVER to deep stretch, felt late pressure from KODIACTION and was nailed on the line for the win, while earning the nod for the
place. STONE'S RIVER away in good order and dictated terms into the first turn, set solid fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, was
confronted by TRIBAL NATION nearing the quarter marker, battled with that foe to mid-stretch, lost the lead to TRIBAL NATION inside of the furlong pole,
came again in deep stretch, was confronted by KODIACTION in the final strides and was gamely bested on the wire. SUNNY SPOT stalked the decent early
fractions, maintained position through the backstretch run, was well placed into the far turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper
stretch, closed willingly in the late stages but could not reel in the leaders in deep stretch. CONUNDRUM was unhurried, raced three wide to the quarter
marker, swung five wide into the stretch run and found his best stride late. BUENISIMO hopped at the start and was off a step slowly, took back off of the
decent early pace, raced three wide into the stretch and finished well in the final furlong. ARMA D'ORO allowed to settle, saved ground to the far turn,
waited nearing the top of the stretch, found room in upper stretch and showed good late interest in the drive. ACCLIDER crowded HOUSE OF LORDS at
the start, chased the decent early fractions, raced three wide into the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch and did not produce a late rally. HOUSE OF
LORDS crowded at the start by ACCLIDER and was off a step slowly, raced in traffic into the first turn, settled in the second flight through the backstretch
run, advanced while saving ground on the far turn but was unable to offer the needed response in the stretch run. SAINT IVES settled off of the early pace
while not far back, maintained position through the second turn, raced four wide into the stretch and did not threaten.

Footnotes
LOTTERY PICK broke in and bumped with NATIONAL GENERAUX (IRE) at the start, still got good position going into the clubhouse turn, elected to track
the leaders well in hand, started a bid with three-eighths to run, came into the stretch three wide, veered out and steadied slightly to avoid contact with
SAREEHA (IRE) just past the eighth pole then found another gear and ran that one down in the shadow of the wire. SAREEHA (IRE) was away alertly,
settled into a tracking position well behind the lone pacesetter, was always traveling well, set down for the lead approaching the quarter pole, was joined on
the outside by LOTTERY PICK, held a clear lead mid-stretch then veered out under left handed urging, straightened out and got caught in the final yards.
NICKEL NICKEL NINE bided time racing in mid-pack and towards the inside through the first half mile, kept to the inside through the far turn, waited
patiently for racing room, tipped out into the two path at the head of the stretch, then attempted to go around LOTTERY PICK but had to alter course when
that one veered out to avoid contact with another horse, then finished up well in the final sixteenth to gain third. NATIONAL GENERAUX (IRE) lunged out
and bumped with LOTTERY PICK at the start, steadied slightly then trailed far behind for the first half mile, made a sweeping move around the turn to get
into contention, came four wide into the stretch and continued to run on well to the finish. HEZA VALENTINE unhurried at the back of the field to the far turn,
took a wide path around the turn while gaining some ground on the pack, angled towards the inside at the top of the stretch but could not sustain the bid and
finished even-paced. BLUE SILVER sent from the break and was first into the turn, opened up on the field down the backstretch setting moderate fractions
while well away from the rail, was challenged at the quarter pole, unable to keep up down and faded. RACKATAPTAP raced inside and near the rear of the
field to the half mile marker, made mid-race move while saving ground along the far turn but stalled with a furlong to run. UPSTART YANKEE went three
wide into the first turn, raced mid-pack of the spread out field down the backstretch while still wide, made a mild bid from the three eighths pole while still
wide around the far turn then was outrun in the late stages.
