Footnotes
TWO WORLDS quick outside speed to the front, well rationed to hang on in the final stages. THE BOSS FACTOR chased from inside, rallied in the lane
coming on too late. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE outside to trip to stretch, ran on evenly for show spot. DRAGON DREW had a tardy start, steadied, inside run
to improve late going. TUFFER THAN TUFF never close to the stretch, improved position in the late going. FRISCO LINE raced along evenly outside with
no late kick when needed. KEEN ON YOU reluctant to load never a menace thereafter. DANANG widest run to turn and stretch with no late response in the
drive. EL BOHEMIO brief outside speed to turn, gave way readily. HIDING THE BRICK never factored throughout. REUX (GB) brief speed, stopped.
