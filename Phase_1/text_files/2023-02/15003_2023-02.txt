Footnotes
REMEMBERING WILBUR saved ground on the turn chasing the pace, moved to the three path entering the stretch, led near the sixteenth pole and drew
off. SUPERSTITIEUX lacked speed, raced along the inner rail on the turn, angled out for the drive and rallied between horses. BORN FOR VICTORY ,
outside the winner on the turn, was fanned four wide entering the stretch and had a mild gain. JEBSTER gained a two wide lead turning for home, was well
clear in mid stretch and gave way late. PRESSING CONCERN , four deep on the turn, floated to the six path at the head of the stretch and was not a factor.
SAAFEN , no factor, raced in the five path entering the stretch. SUNDAY MISCHIEF showed speed along the inner rail, gave way approaching the eighth
pole and drifted out late.

Footnotes
AWESOME VIEW rated close up while two wide early, angled out leaving the far turn, ranged up three deep past the five sixteenths, dueled four wide
outside MISS CASEY from the head of the lane, gained a slim advantage under a drive in mid stretch, carried the battle to deep stretch and was edging
away late under steady handling. MISS CASEY was hustled up three deep past the five eighths and prompted the pace, applied more pressure mid turn,
gained a slim lead between rivals into the lane, sparred three wide and to the inside of the winner from there and stayed on well. MERAVIGLIOSO stalked
inside, eased out nearing the lane, shifted back in and churned on willingly to the earn the show. LADY JEAN , off the early pace, edged up three wide
behind the embattled leaders in mid stretch then flattened out very late. BRAMBLE BUSH was rated back early, lost ground four wide and lacked a bid.
STAY OUT , sluggish from the gate, dropped well back early and failed to menace. SALTY SAUL sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, took
pressure mid turn, stayed on to upper stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
CHALK HILL stalked three wide early on, dropped back a bit leaving the half, was put to serious asking mid turn, circled four wide gathering some steam
into the lane, leveled off under right handed asking in mid stretch, reeled in the leader with about a sixteenth to go and drew clear. ESPERANNNA cleared
early, set a rated pace towards the inside, opened up two wide past the quarter pole, kept on under a drive leaving mid stretch, wandered outward, gave
way grudgingly and saved the place. SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL , off the pace and about four wide, circled five wide into the stretch, made steady progress
from mid stretch the the sixteenth pole then flattened out very late. LOVE IS STRONG drafted back off the pace, angled five wide under asking into the lane
but lacked a serious run. PERKEO , four wide with early pursuit, dropped in mid turn and faded. THUNDERTURTLE dropped well back while saving ground
into the turn, shifted out and failed to respond. SHEMADEMELUCKY made a quick run up to the inside of rivals near the three quarter pole, was pushed
along as the closest pursuer two wide turn, failed to kick on leaving the quarter pole and faltered.

Footnotes
THATAWAY , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, secured command outside rivals inside the eighth pole then drew clear under steady handling.
DIALER bid for the lead outside COLLECT REDEMPTION on the turn, dueled with that one to mid stretch and continued willingly. COLLECT REDEMPTION
showed speed along the inner rail, dueled to mid stretch and weakened late. INSPIRED IRISH saved ground on the turn, swung to the five path in upper
stretch and passed tired rivals. SHERIFF RONNIE lacked speed, floated to the six path in upper stretch and showed a late move outside foes. SIR SMOAK
, four wide leaving the turn, weakened. CAJUN FUN hugged the inner, chased the pace to the stretch and gave way. WILDERZAR , wide on the turn, was
no factor. CATCHING STARS , five wide leaving the turn, floated to the seven path entering the stretch.

Footnotes
HOT N SPICY LOVE , patiently rated off the rail, edged up between rivals past the three eighths, shifted out five wide into the lane, cruised up to engage the
leader in mid stretch, responded to some firmer asking to take over and clear soon after then held firm while ridden out. MUCHACHO MACHO prompted the
pace while saving ground, moved through to the inside of the leader to bid in hand mid turn, went clear soon after, was put to a drive past the quarter pole,
drifted out some when engaged and gave way grudgingly. EKATI'S VERVE saved ground under some early rating, crept closer while saving ground into the
lane, came out past the quarter pole, steadied behind the top pair in mid stretch, regrouped and angled out and churned on. CAMP PENDLETON , four wide
in the clear early on, angled six wide under a ride into the lane, gave hard chase from there, shifted in late but lacked a serious response. BAPTIZE THE
BOY , well placed stalking a contested early pace, had aim two to three wide in upper stretch, failed to kick on nearing mid stretch and weakened. MR.
MOSLEY bumped soundly with a rival at the break, disputed the pace two wide and to the inside of MIRACLE SILVER, edged clear around the far turn, was
joined from the inside by MUCHACHO MACHO nearing the three eighths, stayed on to the head of the lane, wandered outward and weakened. MIRACLE
SILVER , bumped at the break, vied three wide outside a rival, failed to keep up nearing the lane and faded. VIRGINIA FULLA , jostled at the break, was
outrun. LET US MAKE GOLD saved ground off the pace and lacked a bid. AXXERATOR , taken well wide early, retreated around the turn. An objection by
the rider of EKATI'S VERVE against MUCHACHO MACHO for alleged interference in the stretch was not allowed

FORTH , in hand between horses waiting for room around the turn, eased out to the four path inside the three sixteenths pole, closed determinedly outside
GLORY SONG and was up approaching the finish. GLORY SONG stalked the duel around the turn, moved up three deep approaching the stretch, gained
the lead in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. ALPHA CHI RHO disputed the pace outside TOP BOSS and weakened the final furlong. THE SICARII ,
four wide around the turn, passed tired horses. TOP BOSS hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace and weakened in the drive. ROYAL SPY saved ground
around the turn stalking the duel and gave way. ANTIPOISON trailed.

Footnotes
GOLDEN EFFECT vied outside LA SAMANA LAURA early on, spurted away without much asking around the turn, was nicely rated around the turn, opened
up under solid encouragement in mid stretch then held sway through the final seventy yards. WATCH YOUR TONE pulled her way forward between rivals
early on, stalked the winner three wide around the turn, gave hard chase from the head of the lane, kept on willingly and held down the place. WESTERN
LANE , sluggish from the gate, saved ground under coaxing and well back past the three eighths, stayed inside into the lane and churned on. MAVILUS was
rated off the pace and off the inside, briefly steadied past the five sixteenths, swung six wide for the drive and had belated action. SKIPPER SUE , forward
through the opening quarter mile, drop back some leaving the far turn, was under asking three wide nearing the lane but lacked a bid. LA SAMANA LAURA
vied early inside the winner, failed to keep pace leaving the far turn and faded. MISTY MAUVE lost ground four to five wide, raced between runners into the
stretch and gave way.
