Footnotes
TORPEDO AWAY unhurried in the early stages, saved ground along the turn, advanced in upper stretch, responded to right-handed urging in mid-stretch,
shifted out nearing the sixteenth-marker and made a late surge in the final stages to prevail. MURPHYS TIGER tracked the solid early pace, raced three
wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed well in the final furlong, was outfinished by TORPEDO AWAY in deep stretch and was up for
second in the final strides. HONEYMOONZ OVER sent to establish the early advantage, set solid fractions while pressured to the quarter marker, shook
free nearing the furlong grounds, felt late pressure from the top pair, was outfinished in deep stretch and just edged for second, while well clear for third.
LUCKY LAD broke alertly, pressed the solid pace to the quarter marker, could not keep pace leaving the turn, chased HONEYMOONZ OVER to mid-stretch
and weakened in the final furlong. HORSE DOCTOR tracked the solid early pace, raced outside of rivals on the turn, swung four wide into the drive and
finished evenly. CURLING SECRET chased the early pace, lost position on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
VINTAGE showed good early speed leaving the break, was well rated through the backstretch run, confronted by CARMEL BY THE SEA nearing the
quarter marker, shook free and drew clear nearing mid-stretch, kept to task in the final stages and held sway in a drive at the end. CARMEL BY THE SEA
forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the moderate pace while outside of VINTAGE, challenged that foe nearing the quarter marker, was repelled in
that bid leaving the second turn, made one final effort in deep stretch but could not get by the determined winner and held well for place. OH ANGEL lunged
leaving the start and was away a step slowly, allowed to settle in the early stages, raced three wide into the far turn, shifted in and came two wide for the
drive, was outrun in upper stretch, re-rallied inside of the furlong marker, could not reel in the top pair and finished well to secure show. ROSE ROSE ROSE
unhurried in the early stages, saved all of the ground to the quarter marker, was not able to impact the leaders in the late stages and offered a mild late bid.
SWEET TESSA tracked the modest pace, raced three deep on the first turn, maintained position through the backstretch run, advanced three wide on the
far turn, could not sustain that bid in the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.

TONI TWO POCKET broke in good order and dictated terms to the turn, set the pressured pace to the quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch and kept
to task under firm hand-urging in the late stages. CROWN KITTEN crowded a bit at the start, settled off of the moderate early pace, advanced three wide on
the turn, swung four wide into the stretch run and lost ground nearing the furlong pole, re-rallied in deep stretch, finished well in the late stages, could not
reel in the winner and outfinished her stablemate her secure second. SMOKIN HOT BOBBIE crowded CROWN KITTEN a bit at the start, raced close to the
early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and chased TONI TWO POCKET to the furlong grounds, weakened in the final
furlong and was outfinished for second, while holding safely for third. ROLINGA chased the moderate early pace, raced two wide to the quarter marker, was
outrun in upper stretch and lacked a late rally. SUPERSONIC FLYER prominent in the early going, pressed the pace to the inside of TONI TWO POCKET
approaching the turn, shifted to the outside of that rival on the turn and pressed to the quarter marker, lost ground nearing the furlong pole and tired in the
late stages.

Footnotes
ARMA D'ORO forwardly placed in the early stages, attended to the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, overtook the pacesetter leaving the
quarter marker, extended the lead nearing the furlong grounds, confronted nearing the sixteenth-marker by ROCKTILLYOUDROP, met that bid in deep
stretch and gamely dug in in the final strides to prevail. ROCKTILLYOUDROP unhurried in the early going, advanced two wide on the far turn, rallied in
mid-stretch, vied between runners inside of the sixteenth-marker, had his bid met by ARMA D'ORO in deep stretch and just missed for the win in the final
strides, while holding for place. CHIEF JACKSON took back in the early stages, advanced while outside of rivals along the backstretch run, raced four wide
to the quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed with good interest in deep stretch and held for show in the late stages.
STATE OF THE UNION tracked the moderate pace, saved ground to the second turn, came in tight behind the tiring OH GREAT in upper stretch, found
room approaching the furlong pole, was outkicked in the late stages and missed for third. EL JOY took back in the early stages, was a bit keen while
advancing between runners along the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain that bid in the drive and
flattened out in the final furlong. OH GREAT (IRE) asked to show early speed and showed the way in the early stages, set moderate fractions while
prompted by ARMA D'ORO to the quarter marker, was overtaken leaving the far turn and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
RESERVOIR unhurried in the early going, raced three wide into the turn, loomed nearing the top of the lane, was full of run in upper stretch, quickly
overtook TWO TWELVE nearing the furlong grounds, assumed command and drew off under hand urging in the late stages in a good debut. STANFORD
MISS lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out in upper stretch, was no match for the winner in the final furlong but stayed on well to
be second best. TWO TWELVE broke alertly and showed good early speed, set fast fractions while on a clear lead to the quarter marker, felt pressure from
RESERVOIR in mid-stretch, was quickly overtaken by that rival, gave way in the final sixteenth and was well clear in the end for show. RHONDA'S COOKIN
showed early speed, chased the pace outside of rivals to the turn, lost position on the turn and weakened. HILLSDALE NATION forwardly placed in the
early stages, chased the fast pace to the quarter marker, could not keep pace in the drive and tired. HEAVEN'S GHOST bobbled at the start and was off a
step slowly, lacked early speed, lost contact on the turn and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
LOOKIN TO EXCEL broke out at the start and crowded SHARONA'S WILD BOY, was hustled to the early lead and set quick fractions to the quarter marker,
drew clear in mid-stretch, was kept to steady urging in deep stretch, felt late pressure from MR. MASON and held in a drive at the end to prevail. MR.
MASON was bothered at the start by SHARONA'S WILD BOY and was off a step slowly, chased the fast early pace to the turn, saved ground to the quarter
marker, closed well inside of the furlong pole, put mild late pressure on the winner in deep stretch and was second best. BLAZING JAMIE crowded at the
start by SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS, took back off of the early pace, advanced on the turn, came two wide into the stretch run, shifted out approaching the
furlong marker, found his best stride late, was unable to impact the top two in deep stretch but finished well to secure the show. SHARONA'S WILD BOY
was crowded at the start by LOOKIN TO EXCEL then bumped MR. MASON at the break, recovered to be close to the fast early pace, stalked the
pacesetter to the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch, gave way in the drive and was outfinished for third. SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS broke out a bit
and crowded BLAZING JAMIE at the start, tracked the fast early pace, came in a bit tight while steadying off of heels entering the turn, raced four wide to
the quarter marker and lacked a late response. HICKORY WIND broke alertly, rated off of the fast early pace, dropped back on the turn and did not threaten
in the drive. DAD BOD was forwardly placed in the early stages and tracked the fast pace to the turn, chased three wide to the quarter marker, was outrun in
upper stretch and faded in the late stages.

Footnotes
AMERICA GREAT was forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the moderate fractions to the second turn, advanced to confront CROSBY BEACH
nearing the top of the lane, quickly overtook the pacesetter in upper stretch, drew to a clear lead nearing the furlong pole and kept to task in deep stretch to
remain clear over the oncoming runner-up. SECRET CLUB allowed to settle in the early stages, roused along the far turn, mounted a four wide rally into the
stretch run, closed into the winner's margin in deep stretch and was second best in the end. WARD 'N JERRY tracked the moderate early pace, raced three
wide into the backstretch run, advanced nearing the second turn, was asked for run three deep approaching the top of the stretch, could not keep pace
nearing the furlong marker and outfinished C'MON MAN in deep stretch to secure third. C'MON MAN crowded at the start by CROSBY BEACH and was
away a bit slowly, settled off of the moderate early pace, saved ground to the second turn, waited for racing room nearing the quarter marker, found an
opening in upper stretch, chased AMERICA GREAT to the furlong grounds, lacked a late response and was outfinished for third. CROSBY BEACH crowded
C'MON MAN a bit leaving the start, assumed command in the early stages and set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, was confronted nearing
the quarter marker, collared in upper stretch and tired in the drive. GEA unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the second turn and did not offer a
late response.

Footnotes
SHE'S SO FANCY broke well, took command from the start, held a clear advantage through the turn, came into the stretch with plenty left and drew off
unchallenged to the wire. ALWAYS CALIFORNIA off a step slowly, rushed up to challenge the early pace then ceded the lead to SHE'S SO FANCY, was
content to track that one through the turn, launched a bid from the quarter pole, was no match for the winner but finished a clear second. DALLAS ALICE
tracked the leader three wide after a good break, was asked to pick it up inside the half-mile pole, came under a hard ride at the top of the stretch and ran
on while on the wrong lead to hold third. FIXYURHAIRUPRETTY chased the leading pack down the backstretch, made a mid-race move while three wide
through the turn, sustained the run though the stretch and was able to improve position while coming up just short of the minor placings. NIGHT CRUISER
broke well but was not pressed for speed early, fell behind early, then was lost more ground on the turn, managed to find another gear past the three furlong
marker and finished up with some late interest. THE RIVER MANGITA unprepared at the start, spotting the field several lengths, was put into a drive from
the half-mile marker, made up some ground through the turn, then raced a bit greenly through the stretch. VALERIE broke behind the field and dropped
back to last, was a bit green nearing the turn, trailed the field throughout but kept to task and managed to pass a couple of tired foes in the final furlong.
DADDY'S MOM well behind the early pace, saved ground to no avail and was done after a half mile. FOREVER LOVELY close up while three to four wide
down the backstretch, dropped to the rail midway through the turn but had nothing to offer in the stretch. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.
