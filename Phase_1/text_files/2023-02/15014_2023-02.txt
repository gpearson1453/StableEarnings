Footnotes
COWBOY VALUES pressed the pace from the two path then dueled around the final turn, took the lead at the top of the stretch, inched away and held off
the late closer. GOLDUSTER vied for the lead from the three path around the first turn then settled off the pace on the backstretch, made a rebid at the top
of the stretch for a late rally but was not enough. BRITE OUTLOOK was hustled up the rail to take the early lead on the first turn, dueled around the final
turn and tired. CATCHIN DRAMA stalked the pace around the first turn from the three path then made a four wide bid going into the final turn and flattened
out. EUROBELIEVER was not a threat. CURIOUS IRISH had an inside trip but never made a bid.

the inside down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the final turn, moved out to the two path at the top of the stretch to engage the leader but couldn't
match strides and was a clear second. WINNING DANCE was allowed to settle around the first turn then made a three wide bid at the five sixteenths pole,
moved out to four wide in upper stretch but could only chase the top two to the wire. ARCH OF SWORDS raced near the back down the backstretch,
showed late interest and passed tiring rivals. MACER THE RACER was hustled along to the first turn then stalked the pace from the two path down the
backstretch, made a three wide bid at the quarter pole but weakened. KATS PICK was not involved. MALIBU MONEY was through after a half.

RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC sprinted to a clear lead through the final turn then was headed at the eighth pole, battled down the stretch from the inside and dug
in late to win the nod. RED HOT MESS stalked the pace from the three path to the final turn the made a bid on the leader and engaged at the three
sixteenths pole, battled down the stretch on the outside but was outnodded. DONYA KNOW IT raced near the back around the first turn then moved up from
three wide on the backstretch and passed tiring one in the stretch. MISTY DAY was off the pace in the two path to the quarter pole and dropped back.
INAWIC saved ground throughout but was not a threat. BEYOND THE HYPE had an inside trip but never made a bid and lost contact.

Footnotes
MY BOOK was off the pace around the first turn then engaged the leader at the three eighths pole to take a pressured lead around the turn and drew off in
the stretch. HENNING raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then made a bid from four wide at the five sixteenths pole, moved out to four to
six wide in upper stretch to make a late surge to be second best. CHAPEL OF DREAMS settled in the middle of the pack from the two path then moved up
three wide down the backstretch and vied for the lead around the final turn but was out finished. GRAHAM 'S CRUISER tracked the leaders from the two
path around the first turn then was coaxed at the five sixteenths pole, went three or four wide into upper stretch and gave late effort and just missed the
show. GOTTATAKEHIMTO was unhurried to the final turn then made a two wide move on the final turn to close well and be the best of the rest. WAITIN'
ON A WOMAN was slightly fractious in the gate before the start, stalked the pace from the three path to the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack
around the final turn and passed tiring rivals. PAYNTED LOVER went to a clear lead for a half then was headed at the five sixteenths pole and retreated.
THIRTYEIGHTCALIBER was allowed to settle near the back but was not a threat. TED STRIKER saved ground while being forwardly placed to the five
sixteenths pole and dropped back.
