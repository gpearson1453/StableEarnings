was second best. FIGURETI (CHI) stalked the pace from the three path but was no match for the top two. UNCLE FRANK raced in the middle of the pack
from the two path and chased the leaders home. OLIVER settled in the middle of the pack on the inside but was never a threat. SLITHER was never close.

TARGET PRACTICE vied for the lead from off the rail then cut the corner entering the stretch and drew off. MAD GOLD was off the pace down the
backstretch, moved out to four wide in upper stretch for a late rally to prove second best. CLASSIC RED RACER went to the front to set the early pace
floated out entering the stretch and weakened. SILKY'S DANCE pressed the pace from two or three wide then made a bid at the five sixteenths pole and
faltered. BIG RESULTS broke well then lacked the early speed and was never a factor. SLOW raced wide throughout.

MILLIONS tracked the leaders from the inside to the top of the stretch then moved out to three wide for a late rally but was too late. MOONLIGHTMADDY
was off the pace down the backstretch, engaged the leader at the quarter pole, dueled to the top of the stretch and tired. DANCING TRICK saved ground to
no avail. EASY ACT raced near the back around the first turn then made a middle move on the backstretch but was not a factor. THIS FRIDAY was

from the two path to the half pole then pressed the pace to the top of the stretch and fought gamely to the wire. MO VODKA vied for the lead around the first
turn then took a short lead at the half pole from the three path, dueled around the final turn and tired. CORRENTE DE OURO pressed the pace from the
inside to the five sixteenths pole and gave way. PERFECT STRIKE broke in and bumped with SEEHOSS at the start, was placed off the pace from off the
rail to the quarter pole and faded. CABOCHON TREASURE was always back.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA CALI shot out to a clear lead and set all the pace to prove she was much the best. GOTTEMINABIND tracked the leader throughout but was
no match for the winner and was able to hold the place. MORO DANDY chased the leaders to the top of the stretch and made a late gain in the stretch.
RUN TIL DAWN was fractious in the gate, went five wide into the first turn then moved up from three wide and flattened out. SENSING GOLD was allowed
to settle around the first turn then made a three wide bid at the three eighths pole to improve position. PAYNT THE MOON was always back. ATLANTIC
BAND raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch and retreated.

Footnotes
G VICTORY went to a pressured lead around the first turn then inched away to set the pace and just lasted. SMOKING GUN was off the pace on the inside
around the first turn then moved out to two wide at the seven sixteenths pole, was three wide in upper stretch and made a late surged and just missed.
HARDCORE FOLKLORE was unhurried around the first turn then made a four wide looming bid at the five sixteenths pole and was five wide into the stretch
for a late rally to be up for the show. WHITAKER was allowed to settle around the first turn, made a three wide bid at the five sixteenths pole then moved out
to four wide in upper stretch and closed well. HERZEN stalked the pace from the two path but lacked a late response. SMOKY TOPAZ saved ground
around the first turn then moved out to two wide at the three eighths pole and moved back to the rail for a bid on the final turn but faltered. HONOR MY
SPEED pressed the pace around the first turn then steadily faded and jogged in.

Footnotes
GRUNT was hustled to the lead and set all the pace, was challenged at the top of the stretch but dug in and drove clear. HOME VISIT was off the pace on
the inside to the final turn, move to challenge the leader in upper stretch but was no match for the winner and was a clear second. IRON IN THE FIRE
pressed the pace from the three path to the top of the stretch and faded. DREWMAZING was allowed to settle around the first turn, made a bid from three
wide at the five sixteenths pole and moved out to six wide in upper stretch for a late run but was not enough. MONARCH'S MISCHIEF saved ground while
racing in the middle of the pace and passed tiring rivals. CAMEO DANCER raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then moved up three or four
wide on the backstretch and final turn but failed to menace. CPRIORITY stalked the pace down the backstretch then was coaxed at the five sixteenths pole
for a three wide bid but was empty. THUNDERTAKESDALEAD was always back. CHEATIN CHARLIE was forwardly placed to the three eighths pole and
retreated.
