Footnotes
CHAMPSTER raced with the pace inside, dueled for the lead past the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled through the
lane. SALTY J J raced with the early pace two deep, gave chase past the three eighths pole then dueled for second through the upper stretch and had to
settle for that position. CAYATANO stalked three wide, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened the final
sixteenth. GHOST MINE exchanged contact with BLACK SHADOW leaving the gate then saved ground, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths
pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and finished evenly to pass rivals. The latter exchanged contact with Ghost Mine leaving the gate then settled inside
and flattened at the rail on the far turn. FAST RIDE rounded the first turn about the four path, was well off the pace into the backstretch and showed little
response. KID GENIUS raced well back in the four path the first turn and was not a factor. AMERICAN BAD BOY was through early. TAKE A SWING
became edgy in the gate, ran in the six path the first turn, left the turn outside and showed little response.

mid-stretch, finished well and just missed second. DAMISELA chased toward the outside, rounded the turn about the five path and raced evenly to late
stretch before flattening stride. CAPTIVATING GAL chased while tapering in through the backstretch, raced two deep on the turn then flattened inside the
eighth pole. NETTI GIRL gave chase inside then faded at the rail into the turn. U R THE LUCKY ONE contested the early pace and raced close three wide
on the turn then flattened inside the eighth pole.

Footnotes
LET US MAKE GOLD saved ground off the pace on the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and took the lead in the three path
approaching the head of the lane, raced clear at the eighth pole and finished under steady handling. TRANSFER THE FUNDS settled back inside the first
turn then eased outward into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, improved at the rail on the far turn, angled to the five path toward
the head of the lane and finished well to take second mid-stretch. ARTIE CHILLER stalked the early pace two deep, challenged into the backstretch and
took the nod toward the seven sixteenths pole, dueled clear of Vito Andolina approaching the quarter, but was caught nearing the head of the lane, dropped
back at the eighth pole and flattened stride. DON CICCIO rounded the first turn in the four path and raced well off the pace leaving the turn, gave chase
toward the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the four path but was carried wide into the lane and flattened stride. VITO ANDOLINI took
over at the rail into the first turn and rated the pace, was met into the backstretch and dueled from that point, gave up the lead toward the seven sixteenths
pole, dropped back at the rail into the far turn then weakened. FASHIONABLE showed little response. FORCINEX had a brief early lead while tapering in
and rounded the first turn in the four path, though, faded past the three eighths. RAGING WHIRLWIND mostly saved ground.

BAYTOWN FROSTY accelerated to the front nearing the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, contested the edge two deep on the turn, dueled
clear leaving the sixteenth pole and widened later yards. BIG BOY POTTS set the pace most of the opening three sixteenths of a mile then pressured the
winner from the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, dropped back mid-stretch, though held on for second.
GREAT BIG NOTION chased through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn, angled out into the lane, dug in to take third later yards and was gaining
on the runner-up. DONTCROSSFUZZY engaged in close early chase, ran in the three path of the turn then flattened later yards. GOODLUCKWITHTHAT
gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the five path and showed little more. DETERMINED KINGDOM saved ground.

Footnotes
THAT'S HISTORY pressured the pace through the backstretch and dueled to even terms midway on the turn, took the nod toward the head of the lane, dug
in determinedly to draw briefly clear late stretch and held on well. BARRY KARAFIN BETS chased toward mid track, rounded the turn about the five path,
dug in leaving the turn and got up for second the final yards. G DADDY took over at the rail nearing the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace,
was met at the rail midway on the turn, gave up the nod toward the head of the lane but continued a close factor to late stretch before flattening stride.
GOLDEN G came in on the chute to make contact with Alltheway To Cairo then gave chase, rounded the turn in the four path and finished well.
SOMERSET BAY was shuffled back on the chute then chased toward the inside, raced at the rail on the turn, eased out past the eighth pole but flattened
stride the final sixteenth. ALLTHEWAY TO CAIRO was jostled on the chute and dropped well back from early contention, closed the gap in the five path on
the turn and finished evenly to pass rivals. WILLIE THE WHALE chased outside, ran in the seven path of the turn and could only close the gap in the lane.
SACCO AND VANZETTI gave chase inside, ran at the rail on the turn then flattened. KYLE chased outside, rounded the turn about the three path and
showed little in the lane. BEARCAT KITTEN came out to make contact with Alltheway To Cairo on the chute then chased through the backstretch, raced off
the rail on the turn then weakened.
