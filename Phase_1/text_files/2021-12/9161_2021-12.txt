Footnotes
GHAALEB'S DREAMS saved ground around the first turn, made a mid-race move along the rail and took over a slim lead, held a slight edge over JANE"S
GOLD TOUR into the far turn then shook free, opened up on the rail in the upper stretch and stayed sharp. SPECIAL CONQUEST raced two wide around
the first turn, rated inside through the backstretch, launched a two wide bid at the head of the lane, sustained a steady effort and cleared second best.
LOCASH moved three wide through the first turn, settled in the back, came under a ride three to four wide in the upper stretch and churned on for a share.
NEXT TIME YOU WIN was forwardly placed two wide around the first turn, stalked the pace to the far turn, launched a bid for the top pair late on the turn,
came five wide into the lane and flattened out. JANE'S GOLD TOUR held a clear lead around the first turn, vied outside of the winner mid-way through the
backstretch, could not match with rival past the mid-way point on the turn and steadily weakened. UNIVERSIADE rated three to four wide through the
backstretch, had no response when called upon on the final turn and gave way.

came in a couple paths under right handed pressure and cleared second best. MEMORY BANK raced three deep around the first turn, rated off the clear
pacesetter through the backstretch, launched a two wide bid at the head of the lane, shifted to the inside under pressure and cleared the rest. JOEY B raced
three wide through the first turn and remained unhurried in the back, was ridden along four wide into the stretch run and failed to move on. IRISH MAJOR
saved ground around the first turn, rated inside off the early pace, came off the rail and urged around the far turn but had no response. RADIANT CASTLE
raced two wide through the first turn, stalked the clear leader through the backstretch, urged inside around the far turn, then quickly retreated in the upper

Footnotes
UNBURNT vied two wide for the lead around the first turn, applied pace pressure to SYMBOLIST through the backstretch, dueled outside rival around the
far turn, remained in striking distance with a furlong left to run, stayed on determinedly and edged by late. SYMBOLIST vied for the lead racing inside of
UNBURNT around the first turn, battled on through the backstretch and around the far turn, dug in gamely from the inside, held a slim lead at the furlong
marker then got edged out in final strides. TWO COOKIE RULE raced two wide around the first turn, tracked the embattled pair through the backstretch,
was ridden along three wide around the far turn, advanced to race in close contention past the furlong marker but lacked the needed surge to get by.
YALIKEANYTHING saved ground around the first turn, raced in the last flight through the backstretch, was ridden along three wide into the lane and never
threatened. RULE FOLLOWER was off very slow at the start, rushed up and steadied around the first turn, raced outside in the last flight and never reached

RODEO MAN was the closest pursuer of the leader around the turn, was ridden along three wide into the lane, stayed on determinedly and drew clear in
late stages. MISSOURI GENT took a sloid bump at the start, saved ground through the turn, cut the corner into stretch run, tipped two wide past the furlong
marker and got up for place. MAGIC MONDAY broke out a bit awkwardly and bumped with rival MISSOURI GENT at the start, advanced to the lead soon
after, showed the way into the lane, stayed on two wide in the final furlong then weakened late. ALEXIS N NIKO raced off the early pace, came three wide
into the lane, steadied then drifted in under left handed pressure and improved position. CHARLIE'S BEACH raced near midpack, dropped to the inside late
on the turn, cut the corner, bid in the upper stretch then failed to sustain response and gave way. TRUIST got bumped at the start, raced off the pace, saved
ground through the turn and lacked a needed rally in the lane. SNOOZER got shuffled back in opening strides and never menaced. FLASHFIRE showed
response in the early going then faded.

continued on top then came under attack leaving the turn, vied two wide then inside of the winner into deep stretch then had no closing kick left in reserve.

lacked the needed surge to move by. RIDE RICHIE RIDE raced up close then steadied inside near the seven sixteenths pole, had to wait for racing room
along the rail through the turn, got clear briefly at the head of the lane then lost inside path, forced to shift out four wide and had a mid gain. WILE E

Footnotes
U CAN DO IT settled nicely and positioned two wide into the turn, launched a bid for KHOZYS CROWN at the head of the lane, stayed on determinedly and
got up in final stride. KHOZYS CROWN vied inside of LITTLEBITOFBLUSKYS around the turn, shook free turning for home, continued on top under firm
pressure and got caught in final stride. I LOVE TO RACE tracked the top pair in early stages, was ridden along four wide into the lane, sustained a steady
bid and finished well clear for show. LITTLEBITOFBLUSKYS vied outside of KHOZYS CROWN around the turn, stayed up close in the upper stretch then
gave way. GHAALEB'S STORM raced in the back, came wide into the lane and passed tiring rivals. SOUTHERN ATTACK was ridden inside around the
turn and weakened in the lane. PRINCESS CONSUELA bumped with rival at the start, chased three wide around the turn and lacked response in the lane.
EQUALLY EVEN bumped with rival at the start and raced in the back throughout.
