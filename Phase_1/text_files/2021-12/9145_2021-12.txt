Footnotes
MY MAN FLINT bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, raced at the back of the pack on the inside up the
backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, launched a surging bid between horses approaching the eighth pole and got up in the final
strides. CHARLESTON STRONG dueled from the two path around the first turn, took over the lead under a hold while racing up the backstretch, continued
to show the way from the two path around the far turn and dueled down the lane, getting caught late. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) hopped up leaving the gate,
settled off the pace in the two path through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the two path and gained ground on the outside in late
stretch. NO DRAMA raced in the two path around the first turn turn, continued up the backstretch between horses in tight quarters, saved ground around the
far turn, improved position in upper stretch and was outkicked to the wire. PIYPA DE LYNDA saved ground around the first turn, stalked the leaders on the
inside up the backstretch, began an inside bid entering the stretch and faded on the rail in the final furlong. JULIUS THE GREAT bumped with the horse to
his outside leaving the gate, dueled for the lead while saving ground around the first turn, dropped back to chase the frontrunner up the backstretch,
navigated the far turn from the two path, began an outside bid approaching the quarter pole and flattened out in the stretch. READYSEEKGO was reluctant
to load, broke well and raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in
the three path and tired in the stretch. EVER CLEAR raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch and
around the far turn and never fired. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
MALIBU MAX raced close up early between DIZZY GILLESPIE and LONG BEACH KID, dropped back slightly unhurried to the turn, moved out three then
four wide getting roused outside the quarter-pole, reached the front from outside in upper stretch and edged clear under pressure. DIVERT saved ground in
the second flight early, swung four wide approaching the stretch, stayed on his left lead and rallied on the far outside to get up for second. LONG BEACH
KID vied early outside rivals, took over three wide around the turn and went clear, could not hold off MALIBU MAX in upper stretch, then was caught late for
the place. PLATO was strung out four to five wide around the turn within range, and lacked a solid closing punch. DOCTOR D J saved ground to no avail.
DARK AGES raced between horses to the turn, and faded before completing six furlongs. DIZZY GILLESPIE vied early inside, and gave way around the
turn.

Footnotes
COMMISSIO stalked the pace three wide, took over two wide nearing the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. G T'S BLUE SQUALL saved ground in
range, tipped out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead through the lane and was up late for the place. RAIN OF BLESSING set the pace along the rail,
was collared nearing quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and lost second late. BORDEAUX LEGACY failed to menace while racing two wide.
DRIVING WIND chased the pace outside, was eased in the lane and was vanned off. NAKED TACO had brief speed four wide. YEGUITA QUEEN broke
outwardly and appeared to clip heels at the start, dropped far back outside and was eased in the stretch. LADY SIMPATIA had her heels clipped behind
soon after the start, showed early speed two wide, stopped nearing the stretch and was eased.

Footnotes
DEAN'S LIST pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn, kicked clear with a furlong to go and drew off to
the wire. FELIX hopped up leaving the gate, was sent to the lead on the inside early, dueled while saving ground around the turn, gave way passing the
eighth pole and chased the winner home, just holding second. POSITIVE REVIEW raced in the middle of the pack on the far outside up the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the four path, gained ground on the outside in late stretch and just missed the place. UNION STORM hopped up and was away from
the gate slowly, settled at the back of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, and passed tiring
horses down the lane while never threatening the top three. SMOKIN BOW veered out slightly leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leaders on the inside
through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the three path around the turn and faded in the stretch. GLORY AND VICTORY hit the left side of the gate at
the start, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, improved position mildly while saving ground around the turn and tired from there. SILVER
MATT trailed the field the entire way around the oval, raced in the two path around the turn and never fired.

Footnotes
DANZATALE raced in the two-path within easy striking range, ranged up outside BELLE'S KINGDOM to take over soon after completing six furlongs, kicked
clear after straightening away for the drive, wandered out a bit in midstretch and held for the decision. HARDLY SOCIAL bobbled a stride from the gate and
was pushed in by BEARS BREECHES, raced well back to the far turn, shifted out widest rallying into the stretch, altered course swapping to her correct
lead inside DANZATALE leaving the furlong grounds and finished willingly. KHOSEA raced three wide in midpack early, advanced shifting a bit further out
approaching the stretch, but could not sustain the rally. KAY'S PROJECT saved ground in range to the far turn, and could not gain through the late stages
inside. PERFECT KIMBERLY S broke slowly, improved position mildly after six furlongs, and ran on evenly without making an impact. QUIET STRENGTH
was no factor inside. BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY hopped at the break spotting the field a couple lengths, raced three to four wide and never got close.
BELLE'S KINGDOM set the pace removed from the rail, and was finished after six furlongs. BEARS BREECHES broke in bumping with HARDLY SOCIAL,
and was through early. LYRICAL was in a bit tight inside BELLE'S KINGDOM heading to the first turn, chased after that one in the clear up the backstretch,
and gave way approaching the stretch. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER OF HARDLY SOCIAL FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE
IN THE STRETCH WAS DISMISSED.

Footnotes
COREY was in range four wide, cruised to the lead nearing the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. ELUSIVE MOLLY came in and bumped PRINCESS
BETTY soon after the start, raced off the early pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn and finished willingly to be a clear second. TWILIGHT
settled off the pace three wide between foes, swung widest nearing the quarter pole and ran on to gain the show. SHEA ON A MISSION prompted the pace
three wide, steadied near the quarter pole and improved position between foes in the lane. PRINCESS BETTY was bumped just after the start, chased the
pace inside and lacked the needed rally. MISS MIKAELA set the pace along the rail, was collared approaching the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch,
continued on the left lead and weakened. SHINY EMPIRE pressed the pace two wide, tired nearing the lane and was eased.

Footnotes
EMMANUEL led the field on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off down the lane under a hand
ride, much the best. TOUCH CODE bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, moved up to chase the leader on the inside after the opening
quarter of a mile, began a bid from the two path approaching the three eighths pole, couldn't go with the winner in the stretch and chased that rival home,
the best of the rest. LOGICO was shut off leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began to improve position
quickly while racing around the turn, entered the stretch four wide and finished evenly. POSEIDON'S SON hit the gate leaving it, trailed the field on the
inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four and five path and gained ground late on the outside in the stretch. DOMINICAN ICE raced in the
middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, began a three wide bid passing the three eighths pole and weakened on the rail in the final
furlong. STREET FACTS bumped soundly with the horses to either side leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the early going,
navigated the turn from the two path and was never a threat. NYQUEST NIX tracked the leaders on the outside in the early going, raced between horses in
the three path around the turn and flattened out in the stretch. TAPTHESPEEDOFSOUND raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the
opening half mile, improved position while racing in the four path around the turn and faded down the lane. ONCE A GIANT bumped with the horse to his
inside leaving the gate, raced between horses at the back of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and came up empty from
there. PRACTICAL WAY bumped with the horses to each side leaving the gate, recovered to press the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dropped
back quickly while racing in the two path around the turn and was eased down the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
WE MISS SUSIE saved ground close up for a half-mile, stayed on the rail rallying through an ample opening at the top of the stretch, quickly seized
command and drove clear. WILD AMERICA sprinted clear early while removed from the rail, came three wide off the turn unable to contain WE MISS
SUSIE, and stayed on with good courage to save second. MY DESTINY was never far back, loomed a threat three then four wide after a half, then flattened
out through the lane. RESTOFTHESTORY raced in the second flight for a half, improved mildly in the two-path through upper stretch, and finished
one-paced. BARGAINAIRE raced three wide, and lacked the needed response. PLAYERA was no factor two wide. GITANA pursued the pacesetter for a
half, and tired. AWESOME ANNMARIE was always outrun. PANAREA showed little trailing throughout.

Footnotes
LANDBISCUIT was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide, bid four wide between foes around the far turn, reached near even terms
approaching the quarter pole, vied outside of ALADO past the eighth pole and drove clear. ALADO bumped with the winner the start, stalked the pace three
wide, bid between foes midway around the far turn, took the lead nearing the lane, angled in in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth pole but was no match for
the winner in the later yards. ON BASE prompted the pace two wide, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, vied around the far turn, could not match
strides with the top two in upper stretch but stayed on to hold the show. NEW YEAR raced two and three wide between foes in midpack and improved
position without threatening in the lane. MAN ON THE MOON tracked the pace inside, went two wide between foes around the far turn and lacked the
needed rally. DOUBLE BLESSING raced off the early pace three wide, made a five wide move nearing the far turn, reached near even terms approaching
the lane then tired. THENORTHREMEMBERS had his head turned at the start then never threatened while racing two and three wide. DEVOTED KITTEN
was outrun inside. CALL OF HONOR set the pace along the rail and retreated nearing the lane. PALATIAL TIMES made little impact while saving ground.

Footnotes
OFFICIATING chased the leaders from the middle of the pack up the backstretch, began a bid while racing three wide around the turn, dueled in upper
stretch and wore down his rivals to pull clear in the final furlong, holding off a late closer under a drive. ENDORSED trailed the field from the rail through the
opening half mile, raced in the two path around the turn, switched to the outside to began a late bid entering the stretch, and gained ground to the wire, but
was unable to get by the winner. DENNIS' MOMENT raced off the pace on the far outside for the run up the backstretch, began to improve position while
racing outside on the turn, entered the stretch four wide, dueled down the lane and was outkicked in the final strides. DOC AMSTER tracked the
frontrunners on the outside through the opening half mile, began a bid passing the half mile, dueled two wide around the turn and in upper stretch and was
outfinished late. WIND OF CHANGE (BRZ) dueled for the lead on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, took over to lead outright up what
remained of the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and in upper stretch and weakened on the rail in the final sixteenth of a
mile. FLAP JACK was away from the gate slowly, hustled up the rail in the early going, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the turn and
was empty from there. POPPY'S PRIDE pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, began to fade while racing in the two path around the turn
and continued to tire in the stretch.

Footnotes
K. C. CHIEF vied early inside RISK VS REWARD, edged clear after a half-mile, widened the advantage turning for home and remained clear under a drive.
MERLIN saved ground behind the leaders for six furlongs, had aim in the two-path through the lane, could not reach the leader and just saved the place
between horses. HASHTAG NO WONDER went along in the second flight two to three wide on the turns, moved out in the drive, and just missed the place
outside. TESTA raced two wide on the turns, had the rail through the stretch and needed more. GIANTSBANE broke a step slow, lagged well back two wide
for six furlongs, shifted out in the stretch and found his best stride belatedly. SOLAR TAP settled in midpack to the stretch, and lacked a solid closing
response. JARDANI broke a step slow, and was no factor two to three wide. T VILLE saved ground on the turns, and could not reach contention.
UNINVITED GUEST tracked outside the leaders for six furlongs, and tired. RISK VS REWARD prompted the pace outside the eventual winner for six
furlongs, and weakened into the stretch. LOVE IN PARADISE trailed throughout. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, FRACTIONS
UNAVAILABLE.
