Footnotes
CAVE RUN off the early pace outside, approached the leaders in the four path late in the turn, long drive to the wire, fully extended to prove best. WAR
DETONATOR shook clear the opening furlong to show the way up the backstretch and into the turn, responded when challenged turning for home, proved
stubborn to the wire while off the inside and clearly best of the others. LOOKIN FOR EIGHT steadied early to fall back and trail early, remained back
throughout the turn, angled to the outside when beginning to advance entering the stretch, staged a mild rally to be along for the show. FIRERY TALE last
away, moved up to midpack inside, saved ground no avail. STORM ADVISORY stalked the pace settled off the inside, moved closer late in the turn with a
brief bid then faltered through the stretch. RAMPAGE within striking distance in the turn three wide, gave way in the drive. Per ruling (#2022-OP-22),
received 3/6/22 from the Arkansas Racing Commission, STORM ADVISORY was disqualified and placed last, due to a positive test.

Footnotes
SUGGESTED closest to the early leader up the backstretch off the inside, advanced to duel with that one through the turn, floated out a bit to be three wide
exiting the turn, drew clear under steady handling. ABDAN broke alertly to show the way up the backstretch along the inside, dueled through the turn while
remaining inside the winner, was falling back off that one with a furlong to run when steadied slightly, proved no match in the run to the wire, well clear of the
others. MO HEAT went one paced throughout while between horses in the second flight through the turn, lacked closing kick. MOUNTAIN TIME off a step
slow, made little impact while saving ground. KNIEVEL in the second flight while racing outside, tired in the drive. WARNING LABEL off a step slow,
remained always back. PONTI POKER bumped, off slowly, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
WELL SPENT never far back while off the inside, moved closer in the turn, put a head in front entering the stretch, steady handling to hold the runner up at
bay in the run to the wire. CATECHISM dueled up the backstretch closest to the inside, garnered a larger advantage early in the bend, responded when
confronted by the winner soon after, raced on equal terms with that one through upper stretch then gave ground grudgingly. INVALUABLE off the pace and
the inside raced four wide through the turn, lacked a significant closing response in finishing up in even fashion. SAV last away, dropped to the inside for the
turn, failed to muster a closing response. CHAKRA dueled up front up the backstretch outside the runner up, gave way midway on the turn.

Footnotes
PAST POST broke on top, clear in showing the way up the backstretch inside, came in the two path into the lane, came in slightly to tighten up the runner
up a bit, held that same rival safe in the run to the wire in a determined effort. STORMIN HONGKONG in mid pack while racing inside, moved closer along
the rail entering the stretch, in a bit tight upper stretch, could not get to the winner the fibnal furlong, remained clear for the place. CAN IMAGINE fractious in
the gate, prompted the pace off the inside, came three wide into the stretch, lacked a closing kick. FORT RIDGE off a step slow, lacked speed inside, in
traffic along the rail late in the turn, moved out a bit when straightened for home and finished up willingly. TENTWELVEFOURTEEN broke in and bumped
EL VENUE, trailed for a half, three wide through the turn, improved position while widest down the lane. FIXICO in the second flight while between rivals,
checked up into the turn, fell back, moved slightly closer when in traffic late in the bend, went evenly through the stretch. HORSE GREEDY forwardly placed
while racing three wide through the turn. SEEK N JUSTICE three out to four wide in the turn, failed to muster a rally. EL VENUE bumped at the start to be
away a step slow, moved a bit closer in the turn, faded in the drive.

Footnotes
DERBY DAY LASSIE broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch and into the turn by daylight, maintained a comfortable advantage through the lane
while kept to task. PUNCHY GIRL void of early foot, continued back through the turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied down the middle of the strip to be
up in time for the place. LIGHTNING HART away in good order from the outside, dropped inside midway on the turn, continued to pursue that one into the
stretch, could do little with that one in the run to the wire, caught late for the place. CATCH A WHIFF lacked spear foot, improved while in some traffic turn,
flattened out a bit in the late going to lose the show spot. DERONDA void of speed, moved outside for the drive, improved position with some belated
interest. GOLD STRATEGY in the second flight early while between horses, came up empty the final furlong. VALENTINE ANGEL squeezed at the start,
moved up to the second group, faded in the late going. WAR MUSIC broke out, made little impact while racing outside. HAMAZING DEBATE moved inside
early, continued to save ground turn, lacked a kick in the drive. MILLIGANMIKEANDME broke back, was always outrun. WISHIN AND HOPIN finished early,
trailed home.

Footnotes
PATS PROPERTY moved up to vie up front into the first turn, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch, shook clear turning for home, maintained a
daylight advantage to the wire under steady handling. PRIORITIZATION in the second along the inside, crept closer while continuing to save ground late in
the final turn, proved no match for the winner, clear for the place. LEADING WEST last away, lacked early foot, moved closer in some traffic late in the final
turn inside, finished up best of the rest. JAY VEE BEE checked up soon after the start, raced back, fanned out 5w into the stretch, improved position without
posing a serious threat. OPTIMUS KAT lacked speed off the inside, came four wide out of the final turn, finished up evenly in lacking a closing kick.
OUTLIER vied up front for five furlongs between foes, chased the winner final turn, gave way in the drive. TANGO CHARLIE forced the pace from the
outside for five furlongs and also weakened. SOUTHERNER was finished after half.

Footnotes
HOLLIS broke well, allowed the leader to go soon after, laid off that rival into the turn, advanced on that one late in the turn, kicked sharply clear under
moderate pressure in a sharp effort in track record time. NASHVILLE asked a bit to clear soon after the break, showed the way in hand into and through the
turn, offered brief resistance to the winner when that one came alongside turning for home, proved no match the final furlong, clearly second best. MR.
JAGERMEISTER behind the pace toward the inside early, brief wait in some traffic late in the turn, had little for the top two in the drive while clear of the
others. NUCLEAR OPTION went one paced throughout while racing toward the inside. LYKAN last to leave, lagged well back early, widest drive, never
dangerous. HOME BASE lacked speed, was four wide out of the turn, failed to rally.

Footnotes
UPANDCOMINGSTAR raced in mid pack early while off the inside, four wide into the turn, three wide into the lane, rallied, challenged on the outside with a
sixteenth to run, kicked clear. TERRANOVA broke alertly, sprinted clear early, continued to hold daylight through the turn and into the lane, could not
withstand the winner late, saved the place. MARTIQUE MISS forwardly placed along the inside, bit closer late in the turn, eased out for the drive, slowly
getting to the runner up late. GRACE'S SECRET off a step slow, raced back outside, five wide out of the turn, improved position down the middle of the
strip. CHURCH SERVICE lacked speed, in traffic and four wide turning for home, also improved position while not a serious threat. KIZZY B prompted the
issue in the run up the backstretch while racing three wide, began to weaken in the turn. LADY COMMANDER bothered to steady slightly at the start, raced
back, moved off the inside turn, improved somewhat while not a real factor. HOT TOPIC in mid pack while racing outside, four wide through the turn, tired in
the drive. NOVEMBER ROSE chased the runner up in the run up the backstretch, began a steady retreat before a half. SALUTE THE FLAG finished after
four furlongs. AIDANIKE broke with the field, appeared to take a bad step before the half mile marker, was eased and then pulled up, vanned off.
