Footnotes
EXCESSIVE CAT was a bit reluctant to load, was away well and showed good early speed while setting quick fractions, had a clear lead heading into the
lane, was kept to task through the final sixteenth and held in a drive over the oncoming runner-up. MR BOTANICALS sat off of the early quick pace, waited
for racing room on the turn then mounted a four wide bid heading into the stretch, closed well in the final furlong and could not reel in the winner but was an
easy second. HOT SOUP chased the early quick pace from a ground saving position and was outkicked in the stretch run, while holding for third.
DRUMADOON tracked the pacesetter from the inside, weakened in the stretch drive and just missed for third. PATH TO PARADISE tracked the pace
through the turn from a two wide position between rivals and tired in the stretch run. U S TALE was away slowly and had no early speed, saved ground on
the turn and was not a factor. LOVE OF THE SPORT was forwardly placed while chasing the pace through the turn and gave way in the late going. LUCKY
CHAMP was off slowly, had no speed in the early stages and was not a threat.

Footnotes
SUNSET DRAGUNN stalked the early pace from the inside, tipped out to the two path for the drive, gained ground on the pacesetter approaching the
furlong marker, put him away nearing the sixteenth-marker and drew clear in the end. BIGFOOT CITY settled off of the early pace, was two wide on the turn
and closed well in the stretch under right-handed urging to be second best. RICKEY B was off alertly and set the pace through the turn while being
prompted, led into the stretch but was confronted and caught by the winner nearing the sixteenth-marker and was outfinished for second. WHOA BUDDY
stalked the pace into the turn from a four wide position and did not offer a late rally. COOLCROSS stalked the pace through the turn while three wide and
between foes nearing the quarter-marker, steadied in tight quarters when attempting to split foes inside of the furlong marker and lacked a late kick in the
stretch run. GLORY CALL tracked the pace from a two wide path on the turn and weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
ROCKS AND SALT settled off of the early pace, was four wide on the first turn, continued that wide trip by going four wide on the second turn, improved
position nearing the quarter-marker, came to terms with GOOD BYE PUTIN inside of the furlong marker, dueled with that foe and gamely dug in to prevail.
GOOD BYE PUTIN settled off of the early pace, was a bit keen on the first turn and into the backstretch, was two wide between horses on the second turn,
gained ground leaving the turn to meet ROCKS AND SALT's bid nearing the furlong marker, dueled with that rival and was nipped on the wire in a game
effort. RAILSPLITTER pressed the pace through the second turn, made a three wide bid to take the lead heading into the stretch, was caught by the dueling
top pair inside of the sixteenth-marker and was outkicked in deep stretch. LUCK IS GOLDEN was away alertly and set the fractions while being prompted,
lost the lead heading into the lane and was outfinished in the late going. BERNALINHO settled toward the rear of the field while unhurried, was two wide on
the second turn and closed willingly in the stretch drive. MAYBE SOMETIME saved ground while stalking the pace through the second turn, lost ground on
the second turn and into the stretch and finished evenly in the drive. QICK QUACK QUO was unhurried through the run along the backstretch, was three
wide on the second turn and was not a late factor. BARBARONI stalked the early pace, was three wide on the second turn and faded in the late going.

Footnotes
ASSIGNATION was forwardly placed in the early going, sitting just off of the early pace while saving ground, was two wide on the second turn, gained
ground into the stretch to vie for the lead and pulled away in the late going. ELA CALIMERA MOU stalked the pace into the second turn from a three wide
position, gained a bit of ground leaving the turn and was no match for the winner while besting the rest. BELLIZE pressed the pace through the second turn,
vied for the lead into the stretch and tired in the drive. GOLDEN JOURNEY set all of the pace while being pressed, was confronted leaving the second turn
and weakened in the stretch run. KOKO'S MOM was three wide on the first turn, settled off of the pace through the backstretch, slipped to the inside for the
second turn run and lacked a late response. MIDNIGHT LIGHT was unhurried through the second turn while saving ground and was not a factor. LIFE IN
PARADISE was allowed to settle through the backstretch run, was three wide on the second turn and was not a threat. CREAM FLAMBE stalked the pace
along the first turn, lost position on the backstretch run, was outrun on the second turn then was eased and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
BEAR CHUM (AUS) stalked the pace from a four wide position on the turn, swung out for the drive, surged in the final furlong and drew clear in the end.
OUR BOLD PRINCE tracked the pace from a three wide path, vied for the lead inside of the furlong marker and was outkicked in deep stretch. PSYCHO
DAR attended to the quick pace from a two wide position, vied for the lead inside of the furlong marker and was outfinished in the late going, while holding
for third. EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER had no speed in the early going, was two wide on the turn and found his best stride late, gaining ground on the left lead in
the final sixteenth to just miss the show. EXHALTING set quick fractions from the inside and was caught inside of the furlong marker, while just missing for
third. SQUARE DEAL saved ground while stalking the pace through the turn, checked in mid-stretch when attempting to split foes and lacked a response in
the late stages. HOLY GHOST was off slowly and a bit slow into stride, was outrun into the turn, gained ground off of the turn and galloped out strongly.

Footnotes
LOVE'EM N LEAVE'EM was forwardly placed while stalking the pace from a two wide path, tipped out for the drive and under right-handed encouragement
dug in gamely in the late going to confront HIGHLAND GHOST and prevail in a head bob. HIGHLAND GHOST was sent leaving the gate, took back to
press the pace through the turn, shook free of AUTISM BLUE inside of the furlong marker, was confronted in the final strides by the winner and battled
gamely but could not hold him off while holding for second. UNRAPTURED sat off of the quick pace, was three wide on the turn, swung out for the drive and
closed well in the late going but could not reel in the top pair. STREET ART saved ground while unhurried in the early stages and closed willingly in the
stretch run. LOVE CANDY was hustled to chase the pace along the turn while two wide and found his best stride in the final sixteenth. NORTHVALE ROAD
tracked the pace from the second flight, gained ground while along the rail on the turn and was outkicked in the stretch run. AUTISM BLUE was hustled to
challenge HIGHLAND GHOST on the front end, set pressured fractions through the turn and tired in the stretch drive. STARRY SIERRA chased the early
pace, lost ground while three wide on the turn, lacked a late response in the drive and was reported to have bled when pulled up.

Footnotes
STORMY SAMURAI tracked the pace from a ground saving position on the turn, got by the pacesetters inside of the furlong marker, dueled with ARTEMUS
GORDON through the lane and dug in in the final strides to prevail. ARTEMUS GORDON stalked the pace into the turn, mounted a two wide bid into the
stretch to get within aim, came to terms with STORMY SAMURAI nearing the sixteenth marker, battled with that rival and was gamely bested in the late
stages. AWESOME MOVE settled toward the back of the field in the early going, improved position along the turn while four wide, continued that run into the
stretch to gain ground and was up in time for third, while mildly challenging the top pair. MUSIC FESTIVAL pressed the pace from a two wide position, took
the lead into the stretch run, was caught inside of the furlong marker and did not have a late response. FINNEGANS LAD was unhurried in the run along the
backstretch, improved position while three wide on the turn and finished evenly in the drive. RHODIUM RUNNER was away alertly and set the quick pace
from a ground saving position while being pressured, was collared leaving the turn and tired in the stretch drive. CHUMLY chased the pace into the turn,
saved ground on the turn while losing position and was not a factor. CINDY was off slowly and had no early speed, was two wide on the turn and was not a
threat.

Footnotes
AMERICAN BOURBON was away in good order and set the fractions while rating nicely, extended the lead along the second turn and pulled away in the
late going as much the best. FABRIANA was unhurried through the backstretch run, improved position along the second turn while saving ground, was no
match for the winner in the stretch run but kept on to be best of the rest. NAVY QUEEN stalked the pace through the second turn, lost a bit of ground on the
second turn while two wide and tired in the drive, though was a clear third. CULTURED PEARL bumped with PRANCE leaving the start and was away
slowly, settled toward the rear of the field, was four wide on the second turn and made a mild late gain in the stretch run. JUSTA POPPIN stalked the pace
while saving ground through the second turn and lacked a final bid in the stretch. PRANCE bumped with CULTURED PEARL at the start and was away
slowly, was unhurried through the second turn while saving ground and did not rally in the drive. MISS MEGAN saved ground while forwardly placed through
the second turn, lost ground heading into the stretch run and faded in the late going. SAY IT WITH ROSES stalked the pace from the second flight through
the second turn and gave way in the stretch run. SIMMER DOWN tracked the quick fractions through the backstretch run, gave ground on the second turn
while two wide and gave out in the drive. SHE'S A LIL FLIRT stalked the pace through the backstretch run, lost action along the second turn, was pulled up
and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
REBALATION settled off of the early quick pace, mounted a four wide bid on the turn, swung to six wide for the drive, closed fast in the final sixteenth and
was up in time to tag NARDINI in the final strides to prevail. NARDINI tracked the early quick pace into the turn while three wide, collared the tiring
pacesetters inside the furlong marker to take the lead, was clear in the final sixteenth but was tagged in the final strides by REBALATION while besting the
rest. TIP TOP GAL stalked the pace from a three wide position on the turn, was in aim nearing the furlong marker and closed well in the stretch to win the
nod for third. J AND K EXPRESS was hustled leaving the break to pressure the early pace, dropped to the inside for the run along the turn, was kept to task
under firm left-handed encouragement through the lane and was outfinished in the late going, while just missing for third. CAROLINA MIA settled off of the
early pace, was three wide on the turn, gained ground into the stretch and finished evenly in the drive. PRINCESS VIVIAN had no early speed, gained
ground while two wide on the turn and lacked a late kick in the stretch run. GETTIN SIDEWAYS was bumped by SQUARE PEGGY at the start and showed
no speed early, was five wide on the turn and offered a mild late gain in the stretch run. DRAW ME had no speed in the early stages, was three wide on the
turn and was gaining ground in the final sixteenth. DAFFODIL SWEET chased the pace from the second flight from a two wide path and tired in the stretch
run. DEE GEE chased the quick pace from a three wide path on the turn and tired in the late going. SQUARE PEGGY was pinched at the start then bumped
GETTIN SIDEWAYS leaving the break, chased the pace into the turn while four wide and weakened in the stretch run. IMA HAPPY CAT showed speed in
the early going while contesting the pace, led the way through the turn while two wide, was caught at the three-sixteenths marker and gave way in the drive.
HOT RAGEOUS dueled with IMA HAPPY CAT on the front end to carve out fast fractions through the turn and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
CLEARLY GONE settled just off of the early fractions, mounted a three wide bid leaving the second turn, came to terms with GHOSTLY GAL nearing the
sixteenth-marker, dueled with that game foe and dug in in the final strides to prevail. GHOSTLY GAL assumed command of the early fractions, rated nicely
while saving ground through the backstretch run, met the bid of CLEARLY GONE inside of the furlong marker under right-handed urging, dueled gamely
and was nipped on the wire in a good effort. SCHERZO (GB) was unhurried in the early going, saved ground through the second turn, swung out to the five
path for the drive and closed willingly for the show. SOMMER DAISY (FR) stalked the pace through the second turn while saving ground, vied for the lead
leaving the turn and was outkicked in the stretch drive. LA VIKINA tracked the pacesetter through the second turn from a two wide path, lost position into the
stretch and was outfinished in the late stages. SONG OF FIRE was three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace through the second turn while four wide and
weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
NAN ELIZABETH stalked the pace through the turn from a three wide position, was in tight quarters leaving the turn and waited for racing room inside of the
furlong marker, found that room inside of the sixteenth-marker and surged in the final strides to prevail. LOVELY HUSSAR tracked the early pace into the
turn, was three wide on the turn while gaining ground on the pacesetter, vied for the lead leaving the turn, shook clear of FEEL THIS MOMENT inside of the
furlong marker, was on the left left while clear in the final sixteenth but was tagged in the final strides while holding for the place. BIG BRAND settled off of
the early pace in the second flight while saving ground, was steered out for the drive then slipped back to the inside and closed well in the stretch to claim
the show. STARSHIP ENDEAVOR was off slowly and was hustled in the early going to chase the pace, was five wide on the turn, was seven wide in upper
stretch and rallied well in the late going, just missing for third. FEEL THIS MOMENT was forwardly placed through the turn while tracking the leaders, gained
ground while four wide on the turn to vie for the lead into the lane and was outfinished in the late going. LADY SKYWALKER pressed the pace from an
inside position, lost a bit of ground on the turn while still on the rail and was outkicked in the stretch run. HOT AND A MESS chased the early pace from a
two wide path and did not offer a final bid in the stretch. LIL TINKER was off slowly and was slow getting into stride, trailed the field through the turn while
saving ground and made a good late rally in the drive. CYCLONE SLEW had no early speed, gained ground from a two wide position on the turn and
flattened out in the stretch. DINO'S HEAT settled off of the early pace in the second flight and did not offer a late rally. LOOKING AT BO was away alertly
and set the early pace into the turn, was pressured on the turn, was confronted leaving the bend and faded in deep stretch. SCARLET IRIS showed no
speed through the turn while saving ground and did not mount a late rally.
