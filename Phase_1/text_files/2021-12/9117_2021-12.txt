JUST PLAIN ORNERY vied early toward the inside, went clear after six furlongs, and widened steadily through the stretch while kept to a drive. MR MAC
QUHAE moved off the rail approaching the half-mile pole, could not keep the winner in view turning for home, and remained clear of the rest. VOLTE FACE
raced three to four wide around the turn, and could not muster a threat. SINGINTHRUTHESTORM faded inside after six furlongs. STAR BHAI UNION tired
after a half. WADADA showed speed outside early, and stopped before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
RAIN stalked the pace three wide, seized command near the eighth pole, drove clear leaving that marker and held safe. BEAUTY QUEEN pressed the pace
two wide, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, vied between foes past the eighth pole and lasted for the place. READY ORB NOT had her head turned at
the start, saved ground off the pace, angled four wide in upper stretch and rallied outside. MS BIG SPRING set a pressured pace along the rail and
weakened in the final furlong. DON'T MAKE ME BEG brushed the starting gate then became quite rank, dropped far back outside, raced two wide around
the turn and never threatened. NATIONALIST chased outside and was through early.

Footnotes
BUENISIMO was reluctant to load, broke well and raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved
ground around the far turn, dueled for the lead in upper stretch, pulled clear while drifting out in the final furlong and held off a late closer to the wire.
SOUPER FORTUNE saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, navigated the far turn from the two path,
began a bid between horses passing the quarter pole, drifted out mildly in late stretch and gained ground steadily to the wire. EXPONENTIAL trailed the
field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to move up while racing around the far turn, swung five wide entering the stretch
and gained ground on the outside late. AL HILAL brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to race in the three path around the first
turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, angled in to save ground around the far turn, raced between horses in upper stretch,
switched to the inside lane with a furlong to go and gave a late surge to the wire. ROYAL WAR saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader up the
backstretch, began a bid from the two path passing the the three eighths, dueled outside in upper stretch and was outkicked late. PALIZA brushed with the
horse to his inside leaving the gate, entered the first turn in the four path, angled in to lead the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while
saving ground around the turn, and tired in the stretch. LAW OF THE LAND raced in the four path around the first turn, came up the backstretch between
horses in the middle of the pack, raced four wide around the far turn, ran into traffic nearing the three sixteenths pole and was empty from there. VINNY
DREAM raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the
three path and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
ROYAL SQUEEZE tracked from easy striking range to the turn two wide, got roused and began to close in on ONE FAST past the five-sixteenths, took over
outside that rival after straightening away for the drive, and drove clear late. BEASTER saved ground outsprinted early, came three wide off the turn and
was along outside ONE FAST to get second near the finish. ONE FAST sped clear early inside, could not handle ROYAL SQUEEZE entering the furlong
grounds, and yielded the place late. UNCAPTURED KING saved ground well back early, advanced mildly after a half-mile, then ran on evenly.
GUMWRAPPER shifted out four wide past the quarter-pole, moved in steadily through midstretch to wind up on the fence, and made no impact. CATCHING
FISH lost his footing briefly at the break, and never got close. LONG BLADE pursued the early pace, and was finished before going a half.

Footnotes
FATHER GLADO tracked the pace two wide early, advanced four wide around the far turn, rallied between foes, took the lead near the sixteenth pole,
dueled inside of DREAM OF DAY from there to the wire and prevailed. DREAM OF A DAY was off a bit slow, raced off the pace three wide, angled five wide
near the quarter pole, bid outside of the winner approaching the sixteenth pole, dueled to the wire and just missed. GRAND DAVID pressed the pace three
wide while pulling hard around the first turn, dueled two wide down the backstretch, edged clear nearing the lane, led to the sixteenth pole, could not resist
the top two from there but stayed on for the show. DARK AND FITZY hopped at the start, was in range inside, bid nearing the eighth pole and flattened out
in the final furlong. DEFENSIBLE was squeezed back at the start, raced off the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. MEN ON THE HILL (IRE) set a
pressured pace inside and tired in the lane. GLIDER had early speed two wide between foes, settled back down the backstretch, remained up close three
wide rounding the far turn and came up empty in the lane. TIGER MOON trailed inside.

Footnotes
SPECTACULAR GAL was carried out to the three path racing around the first turn, pressed the pace under a hold up the backstretch, navigated the far turn
from the two path, pulled clear entering the stretch and opened up down the lane under a drive. BRITTIZ saved ground around the first turn, tracked the
leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and chased the eventual winner
home on the inside, no match for that rival. SHE NASTY raced off the pace in the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began a bid from
the three path while racing around the turn, and was outkicked in the lane. RUNAWAY BREEZE saved ground around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch off the pace on the inside, navigated the far turn from the two path and made a mild improvement of position in late stretch, while never
threatening the top three. MAMITA LINDA raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace between horses, launched a
bid four wide passing the three eighths pole and flattened out in the stretch. PERGOLA was reluctant to load, broke well and raced into tight quarters
headed into the first turn, forced her way between horses to race in the two path, took over the lead while racing up the backstretch, saved ground around
the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
AMAZING TRIP set the pace in the two-path, got roused coming to the quarter-pole as JUMEIRAH challenged to her outside, dug in through a long drive
while drifting out, and held firm. JUMEIRAH pursued AMAZING TRIP from the outset, turned up the pressure before completing a half-mile, battled through
the lane while being floated out by the leader and could not get by. DIVINE CONNECTION shifted out four wide approaching the stretch with aim at the
leading duo, could not gain on them through the stretch while one-paced, and salvaged the show. EASY COME EASY GO bumped with
DATTTSAFANCYFOX at the start, trailed to the quarter-pole, angled five wide off the turn and rallied mildly. DATTTSAFANCYFOX bumped with EASY
COME EASY GO at the start, raced three to four wide and could not reach contention . MI NEGRITA broke two lengths slow, and was outrun throughout.
MABEE LUCKYNWILD raced forwardly inside to the turn, and had nothing left after a half.

RUNNING LEGACY settled off the pace while racing two wide, split rivals in upper stretch, seized command nearing the eighth pole and drew clear under a
drive. NOVEL IDEA steadied nearing the first turn, raced off the pace two wide, circled five wide around the far turn, reached near even terms approaching
the eighth pole, was no match for the winner but won the place duel. QUEEN MACHA stalked the pace three wide, bid nearing the lane, vied between foes
and was outfinished. AMUNET steadied in tight soon after the start, saved ground off the pace, swung widest in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. PEGS A.
K. GIRL stalked the pace inside, angled three wide nearing the three-eighths marker and weakened in the drive. MAGIC LIGHT failed to menace while
racing three and four wide. ICE COLD GOLD pressed the pace two wide, took over near the three-eighths pole, led to midstretch and tired. EMPRESS
ELLIE set a pressured pace inside and retreated through the lane. SOUPER DUPER READY was outrun inside.

Footnotes
ZANNO brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, kicked
clear entering the stretch and held off a late closer to the wire under a drive. MAMBA ON THREE brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate,
settled in to stalk the leaders on the inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two and three path, began a bid approaching the
quarter pole and gained ground steadily on the outside down the stretch. DIVINE LEADER pressed the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a
mile, dueled from the two path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and gave way between horses late. THINKABOUTIT chased the leaders on
the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and gained ground on the outside in the final furlong. TRINNI SUMMER raced inside
off the pace in the early going, saved ground around the turn and lacked a kick in the stretch, finishing evenly on the rail. KATIE'S COWBOY brushed with
the horse to his inside leaving the gate, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, made up some ground in
upper stretch and was never a threat. WINDY CITY RED hopped up slightly leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter
of a mile, came around the turn in the two path and faded in the stretch. RUNUP UNAVAILABLE FOR THIS RACE.

Footnotes
WONTOUGHSUNOFAGUN was last away by a couple lengths, gained around the turn three then four wide, rallied to a short lead outside rivals in
midstretch, and edged clear late. AWESOME FAMILY pressed the pace outside ADMIRAL TRUFFLES, bid turning for home, reached even terms for the
lead coming to the eighth-pole, then was outkicked by the top one. JOYFUL SURPRISE worked over to the two-path into the turn from midpack, shifted
further out with a clear shot through the lane, and offered a mild response. MASTER Q chased the leaders three wide, challenged in upper stretch, then
weakened through the final furlong. MINDSHIP Q raced two to three wide around the turn in the second flight, and improved position without threatening.
CAN'T BE BROKEN eyed the leading trio around the turn while clear of those behind him, and lacked a solid closing response toward the inside. MACK
saved ground in range early, came two wide off the turn and could not make his presence felt. DUEL FUEL broke a step slow, and was outrun inside.
ADMIRAL TRUFFLES set a pressured pace inside for three furlongs, and gave way into the stretch. ROGER THAT B never reached contention racing two
to three wide. BRIAN'S MISSION was finished early inside. TARQUIN trailed three to four wide.
