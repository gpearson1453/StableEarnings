MAJESTIC STREET sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and held off the closing TRY TO CAPTURE to prevail. TRY TO CAPTURE
broke sharply to chase the winner while racing three-wide, could not reach that rival in the drive but finished with good energy. ZERO DOWN was forwardly
placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late response. BURNZ DA BOSS settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide
through the turn and finished with some late run. SANDMAN'S LEGACY raced off the pacesetters early, saved ground through the turn and failed to rally.
BID IN THE BACK was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. GONE SOMEWHERE showed no early speed, raced
eighth-wide through the turn and failed to menace.

BIG ANDY raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn, reached the fore nearing the five-sixteenths marker, drifted out approaching the
stretch and drew off as the handiest of winners. GOLDEN GODDESS was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up for a striking position into
the stretch, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well to save the place. EARLYNTHEMORN chased the leaders while racing four-wide
throughout and failed to gain in the drive. CANDY RUNNER sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace, weakened after going
a half and was eased through the lane. LOVE ON THE FLY showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was eased through the
lane.

IZEISMAGA tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew off with complete authority. PAY
TAVASCO RENT broke sharply to press the pace of GOOD BOY ROY while racing four-wide, could not match strides with the winner in the drive but was
up for the place. GOOD BOY ROY was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the half and gave way in
the drive. EXTREMELY WICKED was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. MR. ARTISTIC settled off
the leaders from the inside throughout and finished evenly in the drive. PRINCE OTTO aced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and
failed to threaten. WINNING MAGIC was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and gave way. BRON AND

FANTASTIC DAY raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and was up in the closing yards to be going away late.
LINCHPIN STORM pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths marker, opened a clear margin with a
quarter to run but could not resist the winner late. HARD TO COME HOME was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and
finished with a steady bid. SPENDAHOLIC settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly. BIBLEMAN sprinted clear
soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace and weakened after going a half. C DUB lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and
was not a factor. WHIDBEY PRINCE raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
LA CAPRICHOSA sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and drew off through the lane as a handy winner. MISCHIEVOUS KITTY
chased the winner while racing three-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best. PARTY POLICE was reserved just off the leaders
early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly. KIKI MY STAR was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally.
ARIZONA BREW raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CRITICAL CONDITION lacked early foot, raced
five-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and did not menace. SEENEVA THE CAT showed no early speed, raced eighth-wide
through the turn and did not offer a bid. HUJOOD settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MIDNIGHT DARE was
void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
CHEF lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and edged away late. KENZOU'S RHYTHM settled off the
leaders early, moved eighth-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. MR VIEW chased the leaders while racing three-wide and finished
with a steady bid. FLYCATCHER broke sharply to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths marker and gave way. RED
CHARGER was off a step slow, lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and was not a factor. TEN CARAT
ROCK was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace. HARROVIAN showed brief speed and weakened. BULLET TIMES
was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. VIX HERO was away in good order to press the pace while racing three-wide
and weakened after going three furlongs.
