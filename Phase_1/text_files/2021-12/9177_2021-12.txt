Footnotes
GRAY ADMIRAL bobbled at the start, recovered quickly to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the half and was ridden out through the
lane to be kept to task. MISSED THE BOAT chased the leaders while racing four-wide, could not reach the winner in the drive but finished willlingly. TOP
OF THE GAME was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. PERFECT COME BACK raced five-wide
through the first turn, showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. LOLLY EXPRESS raced four-wide through the
first turn, lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the second turn and was not a factor. SURPRSINGLYPERFECT settled off the leaders early, moved
six-wide through the second turn and weakened in the drive. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

LUCKY CHANCE lagged early, raced six-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew clear. SANDMAN'S LEGACY
stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, opened clear margin with a furlong to run and yielded to the winner
through the final sixteenth. EXTREMELY WICKED was in good order to duel for the lead from the inside and gave way through the final furlong.
WARFRONT FIGHTER settled off the leaders early, moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, angled out into the stretch and gave
way. HIGH FLYIN TIGER was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. COWBABY lacked early speed, raced
four-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. CLUB MESQUITE disputed the pace from the inside for three furlongs and weakened. THE RACE
WAS HAND TIMED.

speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly in the drive. SILVER KID showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the second
turn and did not menace. PRINCE OTTO settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. MAJESTIC STREET

strides late. ROYAL SEEKER lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with good energy. STONE

pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly. THE KOHEN lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a

Footnotes
TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and was up in the final yards. PRESS
BRIEFING sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, lugged out through the turn, came back through the final furlong to gain a brief
lead and just missed. KING LEBRON chased the pace of PRESS BRIEFING while racing three-wide, was carried out by that rival through the turn, stayed
on well in the drive and gave way late. BLANK IT settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. PLUM LUCKY
was void of early foot, raced seven-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. SOUTH FRESNO lacked early speed, raced three-wide through
the turn and did not threaten. SIX POINT RACK raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. DYNA CAT was
reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to take command into the stretch, opened a clear margin and weakened through the final sixteenth.
LITTLE JOHN was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. FLYCATCHER was forwardly placed,
moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. CHROMIUM raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out in mid-stretch and was up in the closing
yards. HAVEULOSTYOURMIND was away in good order to press the pace from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the five-eighths pole,
opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths marker but could not resist the winner late. SILENT MUSKETIER raced off the pacesetters early, moved
three-wide through the second turn, reached a striking position and failed to gain late. WILLTOBELUCKY was forwardly placed early, saved ground through
the second turn and lacked the needed closing response. TWILIGHT RIDER was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the
second turn and was not a factor. LUCKENBACH set a pressured pace early, responded when challenged by HAVEULOSTYOURMIND nearing the
five-eighths marker, vied with that rival and gave way after going five furlongs. MUSKYMAN showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn
and did not offer a bid. YHA YHA showed brief speed and weakened. DOWNTHEMIDDLE DAN raced four-wide through the first turn, six-wide through the
second turn and did not reach contention.
