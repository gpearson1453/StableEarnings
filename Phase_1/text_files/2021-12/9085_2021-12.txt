Footnotes
CAUSE TO CRUISE unhurried early off rail to far turn, rallied stretch in time. STONEVICIOUS bumped at the start, tracked to turn, four wide bid, missed.
BIRDMAN RICHIE inside trip to far turn, angled out, blocked stretch run while staying game and might have been best today. ATTA BOY ANTHONY dueled
from two path, stayed game to deep stretch, faltered late. VITALE tracked inside to the stretch, mildly faded in the final furlong. COME ALONE inside trip,
steadied on rail, angled out final furlong with nothing left. BRAZIL NUT never menaced. BARSTOW had a tardy start, bore out, never a real factor. FAST
AXTON speed from rail to the stretch, gave way readily in the drive.

Footnotes
DOM THE BOMB quick to lead, stayed clear into stretch, came over late while all out and lasted. DRAGON DREW tracked inside to stretch, checked on the
rail and shut off late but re-rallied and just missed on the wire. CALL WEST unhurried to turn, moved up while six wide from quarter pole. SACRED KIKI
BIRD chased pace to quarter pole, slowly faded in the stretch run. NORTH ELKHORN raced evenly outside with no late kick when needed. HENNY
HEFNER never far back to quarter pole, floated outside and weakened. RANSACK never a menace. ELLE'SBIGSEACRET never varied throughout.
OVERNIGHT SUCCESS slow into stride, never close. APACHE steadily went to the outside while widest from the turn. DOM THE BOMB came over at the
sixteenth pole causing DRAGON SLEW to check up abruptly and was disqualified from first and placed second by the stewards after reviewing the video
replay.

Footnotes
KULTHUM bounced around start, chased inside, got through and held sway to the wire. HARVEY'S PRINCESS unhurried to far turn, rallied in the stretch
inside, coming on. COURTING WAR good position outside rallied from turn while evenly for show. HEY BABE inside to the front, stayed to the stretch,
faltered late stages. RUN WITH GRACE bounced around start, far back to the half, widest improvement. PRINCESS EMPIRE raced evenly with no late
response when needed in the drive. STORMY WAGER pressed pace off inside to far turn, gave way readily in stretch. WICKED ECSTASY good position to
far turn, could not go on when needed, faltered. WAYWARDNESS bounced around at the start, steadied along first turn, stopped. CATCH MY KITTY never
factored. VOODOO LOA always outrun. GRACEFUL CHOICE never reached contention.

Footnotes
SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE just behind leaders to turn, tipped out, ran off full of run much the best. SOLIDIFY far back to the turn, rallied in the stretch for
place while clearly no match for the winner. SPEITFUL SAM outside to turn with pace, stayed on for show spot to the wire. EXPROMPT (FR) back to the
quarter pole, rallied along to improve position late. GALLANT GUY unhurried early, made a widest run in the stretch to improve late. CUY with pace inside to
stretch, weakened in the final furlong. BAYOU GEM never far back with no late response when needed. POWELL never a factor. BARRISTER TOM no late
punch when needed. GET WESTERN dueled to the turn, stayed to mid stretch, gave way. MERLIN'S SONG not sharp from the gate, rushed to contend,
faltered in stretch. HAZEL RAH speed to the half, came up empty and dropped back quickly.
