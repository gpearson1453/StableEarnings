under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered four to five wide for home, dug in under a drive threatening through the length of the stretch fighting on to the
finish but was ultimately repelled at the end. COMEDIC TIMING coaxed from the gate, grew detached at the tail of the field two to three wide, tucked inside
through the turn coaxed along, angled out three to four wide into upper stretch making ground and closed well to secure the show honors. EVERESTING
vied from the two path among a quartet latched on to one another down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, yielded the front inside the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. EXALTED CHARM coaxed from the start,

Footnotes
MAGNETIQUE alternated on the lead while well out in the track, shook clear in the three path with three furlongs to run, extended the advantage under her
own power late on the turn, was shaken up lightly in upper stretch, widened while kept to the task to near the sixteenth-pole then was geared down while
much the best. MIA BEA STAR settled at the rear of the field, was put to strong encouragement inside the five-eighths, went four then five wide on the turn,
turned into the stretch under a hard drive, drifted in late and earned the place while no match for the winner. CALIBOGUE SOUND alternated on the lead
with the winner, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back with three furlongs to run then came under a drive and tired but was clear for the show.
ADDILYN came in at the start while hustled, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch under a drive
and came up empty. AWESOMENEWYEAR settled off the early pace, moved out near the three-quarter pole, was urged three then four wide on the turn
and capitulated.

Footnotes
RUNNINSONOFAGUN hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside in closest aim of a spurting leader, advanced into the turn and assumed command
with seven-sixteenths to run as ACTUALIZE backed down suddenly, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths under challenge from GOOD SKATE to the
outside, swung four then three wide straightened away into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive kept to task. GOOD SKATE coaxed from the gate,
raced three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, advanced tucked to the two path into the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five then
four wide into upper stretch heads apart for command, dug in under a drive shaken off straightened away and kept on to preserve the place honors.
ACTUALIZE brushed the near side stall at the start getting away last, advanced outside rivals taking command after the start and spurted briefly away three
then two wide through a swift opening quarter, had the rider take a light hold into the turn to throttle down some speed and had his charge back away in
overreaction conceding the front with seven-sixteenths to go, received two taps to the right shoulder and got placed to brief urging tipped three wide at the
three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors in a good effort. GUN MAESTRO chased four then three
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened. U KANT WHIP IT bobbled at the break coming inwards under
hustling, chased along the inside, swung three wide for home, got placed to a protective hold straightened away and was guided outwards while being
eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
R WORKING GIRL set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, extended the advantage outside the quarter-pole,
responded well under a hand-ride in the stretch and proved much the best while widening to the wire. MAZAL EIGHTEEN pressed the pace on the outside,
was asked in the three path on the turn, lost touch with the winner nearing the quarter-pole and proved no match while just able to get the place. HEY IT'S
TATI broke in and bumped lightly with a foe, raced just off the pace, dropped back three wide into the turn, moved to five wide around the three-eighths,
floated seven wide into the stretch under a left-handed crop and just missed the place while able to get the show. VIOLENTIAM tracked the pace on the
outside, chased in the four path on the turn and tired. HANDLE THE TRUTH bumped lightly with a rival at the start, dropped towards the rear, went two then
three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch then drifted further out and failed to threaten. INFRINGEMENT settled at the rear on the outside, was
urged three wide on the turn and was no factor. LOT OF HONEY dropped back between horses, settled outside under some urging, went four wide on the
turn and failed to respond. EMPIRES FIRST LADY broke out and brushed with a foe, was urged along on the inside, saved ground on the turn and also
failed to respond. GHOSTGHOSTGHOST brushed with a foe at the start, was ridden along near the back, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn
and showed little.

Footnotes
SEA FOAM broke in at the start bumping BROOKLYN STRONG and came under hustling, knocked heads and jostled into the first turn with CAPTAIN
BOMBASTIC to his outside before gaining the advantage while under some pressure from that rival through moderate splits, showed the way in hand just
off the inside down the backstretch as the field took closer order in behind, tucked inside into the far turn, came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths
under threat from a pair as OUR LAST BUCK latched on three wide, shook off CAPTAIN BOMBASTIC inside that juncture, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch under challenge from OUR LAST BUCK, repelled that rival to inch away a furlong out, dug in under growing late threat and held gamely to
prevail. DANNY CALIFORNIA coaxed from the gate, chased along the rail through the first turn before taking to the two path down the backstretch, tucked
inside at the nine-sixteenths and advanced briefly, tipped out with seven-sixteenths to go three wide and floated four wide at the three-eighths under coaxing
carrying TIERGAN five wide to his outside, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive closing through the final sixteenth but was ultimately
rebuffed at the end. OUR LAST BUCK coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside through the first turn before tipping four paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked three wide through the far turn advancing to latch on the top pair when placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, threatened the
leader through the latter portion of the turn and swung three wide into upper stretch, got repelled nearing the eighth pole and ran on to preserve the show
honors well clear of the rest. CAPTAIN BOMBASTIC hustled from the gate, led narrowly very early on and tucked to the inside jostling with SEA FOAM
when dueling into the first turn, got eased off a bit and prompted that rival from the outside in the two path and then three path down the backstretch, tucked
once more two wide into the far turn, came under coaxing near the three-eighths now between rivals, got shaken off through the latter portion of the turn,
continued two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened. TIERGAN three wide through the first turn, chased four paths off the inside down the
backstretch and into the far turn before being floated five wide near the three-eighths by DANNY CALIFORNIA when placed to urging, swung four wide at
the head of the stretch and weakened in the drive. WILD BANKER two to three wide through the opening bend, chased three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. BROOKLYN STRONG got bumped at the start by SEA FOAM breaking inwards,
chased just off the inside through the first turn before tipping three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked back two wide through the far
turn coming under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to run, went six to seven wide at the top of the stretch and was unable to make an impact.

Footnotes
BOSSMAKINBOSSMOVES was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed fast to get the lead
outside the furlong marker, drew away under a drive to near the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand-ride to the wire while much the best.
CURLIN'S WISDOM showed early speed then tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up in the four path to make a bid with three furlongs to run, gained
the lead coming to the five-sixteenths, lost the lead under a drive outside the furlong marker and proved no match while clear for the place. JUGGLER
pressed the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch and weakened while able to secure the show.
EXCURSIONNISTE bumped hard with a rival at the start, raced well back in the field, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch then
moved further out and failed to threaten. REGAL EMPIRE broke out and bumped hard with a foe, angled out early, was urged along off the pace, went five
wide on the turn and came up empty. SALUTE TO AMERICA showed speed and set the pace under pressure, was asked in the two path on the turn, lost
the lead nearing the five-sixteenths and faded. UNCLE WATER FLOW broke out and hit the gate then bobbled, stumbled on the next stride, was urged
along at the rear on the outside, went around the turn in the six path, drifted inward in upper stretch and was no factor. SALTY HEIR was bumped hard
between horses at the start then checked, settled towards the rear after being taken in hand early, was urged four then three wide on the turn and failed to
