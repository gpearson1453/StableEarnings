Footnotes
CADET CORPS raced in the two and three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began a bid
from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew off to the wire while drifting in mildly late. FISHING FOR FUN saved
ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, began to improve position while still saving ground around the far turn, and
chased the eventual winner home, drifting slightly in late stretch, the best of the rest. MILLENNIUM CONDO chased the leader from the two path around the
first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn, led entering the stretch, was caught with a
furlong to go and finished evenly. BLUTO'S CANDY trailed the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to move up from
the rail while racing around the far turn, continued to gain in upper stretch and was outkicked from there. SONIC KITTEN raced in the two path around the
first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two path and made no bid. FOOD BANK HELPER angled
in to save ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, switched to the outside while racing around the far turn, improved
position entering the stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. AWESOME ED led the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the
backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the far turn and continued to tire down the lane.

Footnotes
APPOINTED led inside early, was content to rate back and angle out when TILSA advanced to the lead late on the first turn, stalked two wide down the
backstretch, regained command near the five-sixteenths pole, quickly cleared, angled in turning for home and held clear. WONDER BLONDY hesitated at
the start, raced off the pace three wide around the first turn, edged closer two wide around the far turn and finished well to gain the place. DESTINIQUE
saved ground in midpack for a half, advanced three wide around the far turn but was one-paced through the stretch. MIDNIGHT BELLA trailed inside for a
half, went three wide around the far turn and had a mild rally outside. MONEY FACTOR tracked the pace three wide and faded in the lane. TILSA advanced
in the three path to take the lead late on the first turn, cleared and angled in soon after, led inside to the five-sixteenths marker and tired. FANTASTIC
KINGDOM saved ground and failed to menace.

Footnotes
WILLY THE SHOE broke to the lead and moved inside, shook off ON HIS TOES after three-eighths of a mile, and was driving to remain clear. MR MAC
QUHAE was outsprinted early, swung four wide approaching the stretch, and rallied with good energy outside. ON HIS TOES delayed the start difficult to
load, eventually did so without the rider, came away in good order and pressed WILLY THE SHOE from outside, could not keep pace by the top of the
stretch, got overhauled for second but was much best of the remainder. GOGEES raced three wide in range to the head of the lane, and faded. DANLEY
was no factor two wide. RAYO was no factor inside. CUPID'S GHOST broke awkwardly spotting the field two to three lengths, and trailed outside.

Footnotes
LUCAGO raced off the pace on the inside in the early going, trailed the field headed into the turn, began a three wide bid passing the three eighths pole,
dueled outside in upper stretch and pulled clear in the final sixteenth of a mile. ON JET HEIR led the field on the inside up the backstretch, continued to
show the way while saving ground around the turn, dueled from the rail in upper stretch and gave way late, the best of the rest. RUN LEA RUN chased the
leader on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn, and was no match for the top two down the lane. RAYO
COLORADO broke a step slowly, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, cut in to save ground around the turn, and faded on the rail in the
final furlong.

SELF TAUGHT settled off the early pace inside, advanced along the rail around the turn, tipped two wide nearing the lane, lacked a path outside, ducked
back to the wide open rail in upper stretch, closed inside and was up late. NO QUE NO dueled along the rail to upper stretch, kicked clear while drifting out
in upper stretch, fought on outside of the winner and just missed. INTER MIAMI dueled two wide to upper stretch, could not match strides there but held well
enough to preserve the show. STAR SIGN raced off the pace two and three wide, made progress nearing the lane but flattened out. SEPTEMBERTEN was
devoid of speed while racing in the two path and passed tiring rivals. WITH VERVE threw his head just prior to the start was off five lengths in arrears, raced
four wide and never threatened. THE PREDICAMENT failed to menace while racing three wide. THE DISTRACTOR stalked the pace three and four wide
and came up empty in the lane.

TREVESS tracked outside the leaders four wide to the end of the turn, challenged outside ODRAMARK in upper stretch, and forged past into the last eighth
of a mile. ODRAMARK pressed the early pace three wide, reached a short lead late on the turn, dug in when confronted by TREVESS into the lane yielded
grudgingly. NURSE JUDY saved ground into the turn, shifted out three wide approaching the stretch, and rallied mildly. FOLLOW ME MOM was a step slow
at the start, trailed for three furlongs inside, moved out in the stretch and offered a belated response. AWSUM ROAR vied up front two wide, lodged a bid
between horses on the turn, but faded through the stretch. SIMPLIFY (ARG) sprinted clear briefly up the backstretch, came under fire from a trio of pursuers
heading into the turn, and folded approaching the stretch. MIDSHIP LADY failed to menace three to four wide.

second late. PALADIO tracked the pace four wide and weakened in the drive. SURPRISE FACTOR saved ground and failed to menace. UNPUBLISHED

VENEZUELAN TRIUMPH steadied approaching the first turn in the three-path, remained three wide advancing after a half-mile, took over outside
ETERNAL REST coming off the far turn and drove clear. PANORAMA TRUCK got bumped between PAPI BELLO and ETERNAL REST at the start, went
along in range three wide through the middle stages, moved out a bit further approaching the stretch, and rallied to go clear of the remainder. ETERNAL
REST bumped with PANORAMA TRUCK at the start, got outsprinted to the front by WILD IRISHMAN while tugging hard inside that rival to the first turn,
moved out to track from outside still headstrong to the backstretch, reached a short lead after six furlongs, and weakened once overtaken by the winner
turning for home. CRYPTIC CREED was a step slower than the rest to begin, saved ground taking closer order after a half-mile, went around WILD
IRISHMAN midway on the far turn, went back to the fence and came up empty. PAPI BELLO bumped with PANORAMA TRUCK at the start, moved off the
inside on the first turn, steadied in traffic entering the backstretch, and stayed in range for six furlongs before retiring. WILD IRISHMAN set the pace to the
end of the backstretch, stopped abruptly and steadied plummeting to the rear on the far turn, and was eased up late.
