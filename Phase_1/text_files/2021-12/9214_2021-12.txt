Footnotes
KNIGHT SLEEPER, urged between foes, then along the inside pressing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, forged clear in upper stretch and
extended the advantage under pressure. VEGAS SLIPPERS, urged inside rivals prompting the pace in the opening stages, switched out three wide
dropping off the first flight to track those foes into the turn and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors late while proving no threat to the
winner. AKEMI joined the pace three wide on the backstretch, forced the issue outside a rival racing into the turn and gave way. READY TO RUMBLE broke
outwards bumping SECRETIVE MISS, was righted to track off the first flight from out of striking distance racing to the turn but offered no rally. SECRETIVE
MISS, bumped at the start, settled outside a rival in the last flight and failed to menace thereafter. HELENS SPIRIT dislodged her rider to run loose
momentarily prior to the start, was settled inside foes on the backstretch and dropped out early.

Footnotes
MELINA'S DREAM, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, came under pressure to close the gap on that rival nearing
upper stretch and wore down CEDAR BEACH in time following a prolonged drive. The latter was urged to the lead, dictating the pace on a narrow margin a
bit off the rail racing to the backstretch, resisted the winner's bid grudgingly racing into upper stretch but was collared late. WONDER WATER tracked the
leaders between foes in second flight racing to the far turn, shifted inside rivals racing through the stretch and edged a rival for a share. AZURE SKY tracked
the leaders three deep as part of the second flight racing to the far turn but offered no closing bid. THE DUNGEON angled to the inside in early stages
tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, tipped out racing into upper stretch while being prompted to advance but faded between foes in the last
furlong. ROJO TORO angled to the inside early tracking off the second flight but proved no threat. SPEEDY DAREDEVIL broke slowly, switched outside
foes racing to the backstretch but never gained contention.

Footnotes
PREPARE FOR GLORY, unhurried along the inside racing through the backstretch, gathered momentum nearing the turn, shifted out three wide nearing
the lane advancing on the leaders, then continued with a steady late response to gain the advantage under firm left handed pressure. CORT'N ASONG
switched out tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening three furlongs, advanced to press the issue racing into the turn, gained the advantage racing into
upper stretch and grudgingly resisted the winner while just failing to contain that foe. LUCKY LOVER BOY settled into stride dropping well off the leaders
while angling to the inside, saved ground on the turn, then came around a tiring rival to gain position inside foes while earning a share. BOURBON WISDOM
tracked the leaders between foes from behind the second flight, shifted out four wide racing into the turn while being prompted to advance and continued
evenly. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY settled last racing to the turn, angled outside rivals racing into upper stretch but passed only tiring foes. MINNESOTA
LUCKY broke readily, dictated the pace on a clear margin along the inside through the backstretch, dueled inside a rival racing through the turn and gave
way nearing midstretch. MR LIGHTNING BOY tracked the pacesetter three wide early and faded after a half.

EMPHASIZE, reserved between foes dropping well off the leaders racing to the first turn, shifted out four wide racing into the second bend, steadily
advanced in that path to upper stretch and wrested the advantage leaving the furlong marker to go clear under firm handling. ANALYZEYOURVISION
tipped outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch tracking just off that rival under light reserve, advanced to take over midway through the far turn, held
sway into the lane but proved no match when confronted by the winner. DECEIVER was settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch,
switched outside foes nearing the lane, was fanned five wide racing through the stretch but continued willingly to edge a rival for a share. TOUR THE
WORLD, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out in upper stretch to split foes four wide racing through the lane and continued with
interest while just missing for a share. SETTE STELLE tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the far turn but offered no rally. MAGIC BOMB
angled inwards tracking off the second flight in the opening quarter, switched out three wide to lodge a brief bid racing through the far turn but flattened out
in upper stretch. ASSERT DOMINANCE angled to the rail leaving the chute to track just off the leaders but gave way racing into the far turn. GLEAMING
SWORD, urged to gain a clear lead while angling to the inside leaving the chute, set the pace to the far turn and gave way once headed. BRING IT BACK
drifted out racing into the first turn and never gained contention. SMALL JOHN, caught four wide, then three wide racing to the backstretch, retreated early.

ROAD TO MEATH was rated along the inside stalking the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, shifted off the inside racing through the far turn to advance
in the four path entering the stretch and produced a steady late response to wrest the advantage under firm encouragement. DREAM LINER (BRZ) angled
to the inside leaving the chute to track off the second flight under light reserve, tipped a bit off the inside briefly awaiting an opening nearing upper stretch,
was urged to advance between foes just off the inside bidding for command leaving midstretch but couldn't match the winner's kick. FIG JELLY, forwardly
placed stalking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, took over from that foe nearing upper stretch to set the pace past the furlong marker but was
collared by the top pair in late stages. FADE AWAY, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped outside a rival racing into the far turn, shifted
out four wide racing through upper stretch but continued with interest to gain position to the end. THANK YOU RICKETTS broke awkwardly, was switched
outside rivals racing to the backstretch, advanced to contention four wide racing into the far turn, was fanned five wide into the lane and steadily faded.
MORGAN'S Z VA tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, was prompted to make some brief progress three wide racing into the far
turn but flattened out in upper stretch. TOSS was hustled to the lead while angling to the inside, set the pace to the far turn, briefly contested the issue inside
foes into the lane but gave way in the drive. NOTACATBUTACARD switched out three deep leaving the chute while prompted to contention, tracked outside
a rival in second flight but gave way after a half.

DECIMATOR broke outwards bumping ALL FOOLS DAY, was righted to track off the first flight three wide between foes racing into the turn, switched out
four wide in upper stretch while being roused to advance, shifted inwards disputing the issue outside a rival to late stages and narrowly prevailed in time
under firm encouragement. MYSTERY MO tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, angled inside rivals entering the stretch while being urged to
advance, struck the front between calls in late stages but just failed to contain the winner. JIMMY THE KID urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the
outset into the turn, shifted a bit off the rail racing into upper stretch while resisting several challengers but yielded to the top pair in late stages. MONEY
SONG, urged prompting the pace outside a rival racing to the turn, dueled into the lane and gave way midstretch. JACKSON STRONG tracked off the first
flight four wide racing to the turn, was fanned five wide into the lane and steadily faded. BARAHIN, urged inside foes in pursuit of the leaders into the turn,

Footnotes
NANTUCKET RED was urged pursuing the leaders four wide leaving the chute, shifted inwards to gain a position just outside the pacesetter stalking that
rival into the backstretch, advanced to press the issue midway through the far turn challenging for command nearing upper stretch, then responded to firm
right handed pressure while shifting out late to hold STRIKING CHROME on a safe margin to the end. The latter shifted inwards a bit in early stages while
being rated off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, switched out on the far turn while being prompted to advance, swung out four wide
racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap while failing to gain even terms with the winner. PYTHONESS, reserved along the inside
racing to the backstretch, shifted out racing into upper stretch to split foes three wide and continued with interest to close the gap shifting inside the top pair
late. PRINCESS JAVONCIA, urged inside foes to gain the advantage racing to the first turn, dictated the pace through the backstretch to the far turn, dueled
inside the winner to midstretch and gave way. ZARINA, reserved along the inside in early stages, switched outside foes racing into the far turn, was fanned
four, then five wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed final kick. TONAL VERSE angled to the rail tracking off the second flight racing to the
backstretch, tipped out racing into the lane while being prompted to advance between foes but offered no rally. FIRSTMATE, prompted to a forward placing
three deep between foes leaving the chute, shifted in to track off the first flight outside a rival racing into the backstretch, shifted out nearing the lane to
lodge a brief bid three wide between foes but quickly came up empty in the drive. CLASSY WOMAN, in touch with the leaders in early stages, angled to the
inside nearing the backstretch to track just off the pacesetter to the second bend and steadily faded into the lane. TEGLA dropped out early.

Footnotes
WILLOUGHBY GAP tracked off the first flight inside foes racing to the turn, saved ground on the bend briefly awaiting an opening, came through inside foes
to challenge for command racing into upper stretch, then wrested the advantage and edged clear late under firm handling. FAN FAN settled along the inside
racing through the backstretch, saved ground on the turn steadily drawing into contention in upper stretch, was urged to bid between foes just outside the
winner in late stages but couldn't match that foe while prevailing for the place honors. FRU FRU ZAN tracked off the first flight five deep in the opening
quarter, made a sharp rally to striking position racing four wide through the turn, gained the advantage racing into upper stretch but was outkicked by the top
pair. TAPIT'S GIRL was rated off the second flight between foes racing to the turn, shifted inwards to split rivals just off the inside racing into the stretch and
continued to improve position. BAND SWEETHEART tipped out three wide early while being prompted to terms with the leaders, pressed the pace in that
path racing into the turn and gave way between foes in the drive. MISS LIANA switched out four wide in early stages tracking off the first flight, continued
between foes into the bend but had no closing bid. PRINCESS LIVIA settled off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn but never gained contention.
QUALITY TOO SPARE proved no factor. MY SARASOTA STAR broke sharply, angled inwards forcing the pace between foes racing into the turn but
quickly came up empty. SWEET BABY RAELYNN, urged inside rivals disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
BOCA, reserved well off the leaders while angling to the inside in the opening half, came around some tiring foes nearing upper stretch, angled to the rail
entering the lane while being prompted to advance inside foes, then produced a steady late response to wrest the advantage in time under firm right handed
encouragement. CECI'SAPRILHOTTIE tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while shifting out
four wide nearing upper stretch, gained the advantage in late stages but couldn't fend off the winner. FORBIDDEN DREAM, bumped at the start while
ducking into the path of MERICATHEBEAUTIFUL, was rated tracking the pacesetter outside a rival from just out of striking distance in the opening half,
advanced between foes nearing the lane to challenge for command, then resisted the top pair to late stages while just outkicked. BRAMBLE BUSH was
rated out of striking distance while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, swung out racing through the far turn while being prompted to advance, was
fanned five wide in upper stretch but had no final kick. MERICATHEBEAUTIFUL, bumped at the start, settled into stride racing to the first turn, switched out
three deep entering the backstretch commencing an early move to advance on the leaders nearing the second bend but flattened out racing into upper
stretch. SHE'S JUST QUALITY tracked off the second flight inside foes in early stages but steadily faded into the far turn. BLUE KENTUCKY GIRL broke
outwards bumping FORBIDDEN DREAM, was righted, then sprinted clear of the field racing to the backstretch, held sway into the far turn and gave out
abruptly entering upper stretch. PHONE A FRIEND settled last after the opening quarter and failed to menace thereafter. MYRA FLEENER tracked the
pacesetter inside a rival as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch but emptied out early.
