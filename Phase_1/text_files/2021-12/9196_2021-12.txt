Footnotes
KUKULKAN engaged in close chase through the opening three sixteenths of a mile, took over approaching the three eighths pole, dueled clear past the
quarter pole and held well under steady stretch handling. DISTANT THUNDER was hustled along with a slim lead the opening three sixteenths then gave
chase past the three eighths pole, dropped back into the turn, raced off the rail through the turn and settled for second. JESS'S RESERVE chased through
the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn, drifted toward the head of the lane then dueled through the stretch for third. DEO FORTE chased, ran in the
three path of the turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. J P'S SONG engaged in close chase inside, but dropped back at the rail leaving the
quarter pole and weakened the final furlong. AUBURN MILL chased, rounded the turn about the five path and ran evenly down the lane.
THEHEATOFTHENIGHT was steadied then shuffled back on the chute and never factored.

came out a path leaving the turn but dug in from there to widen the final furlong. YOUTHINKTHATSFUNNY stalked off the rail then challenged nearing the
three eighths pole, dropped back at the five sixteenths, came back to threaten at the rail into the lane, though, had to settle for second. NO CHANGE

three path of the far turn, drifted into the lane and came along for third mid-stretch. TRIPLE BAD settled off the rail the first turn then eased out into the
backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn and finished evenly to pass rivals. DESHACKLED rated close to the
early pace inside, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn. NICO rounded the first turn in the four path then
stalked into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and weakened the final furlong. NIGHT TRAIN
WAYNE entered the first turn about the five path then angled in midway on the turn, settled off the pace into the backstretch, though, showed little response.

four path of the far turn, dug in leaving the turn to take second the final yards and just missed. WILLIAM CROTTY stalked off the rail, picked up the chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead past the five sixteenths, dueled clear midway on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch
encouragement but was caught flattening stride the final yards. CRAZY IDEA settled back inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the five
path of the far turn and finished well. TIZEZZY raced well back about the three path, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase from the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn in the six path then flattened widest in the stretch. FRATHOUSE MUSIC took the lead into the first turn and rated the pace inside,

the rail on the far turn. GLAD MOON (GER) was never a factor. ENVISION SUCCESS rounded the first two turns in the four path, gave chase into the
backstretch then faded toward the far turn.
