Footnotes
DISTINCTLY BLUE showed good early speed from the outside, took command nearing the far turn, raced just off the inside in the drive and held gamely to
be clear under strong handling. U KNOW I B LION stalked the pace from the outside, moved up three to two wide in the lane and finished second best.
MISS MIAMI settled off the early pace, moved up three to four wide in the stretch run and had not enough for the top pair. GLORY ROLL was off slowly,
settled to the back of the pack early on, raced four wide near the quarter pole and had no late rally. TEE UP vied for the early lead from the inside and gave
way the final eighth of a mile. JIMA'S GOLD dropped back early and failed to respond. LETS RACE LADYS was slow early and never threatened. The
photo finish margins were estimated manually by Equibase.

SUMMER HELPER was allowed to settle early on, moved up three wide around the far turn and drew off in the drive to be well clear under a steady hand
ride. MAGIC MIKAELA stalked the early pace, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole but was no match for the winner in the drive. STARSHIP
PRECIOUS was unhurried early, moved up three to four wide, angled in and had not enough for the top pair. REAL GOOD VYBZ was allowed to settle
early, moved up six wide into the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. TIZNOWMORNING broke in the air, raced just off the inside and had no late
response. LLUVIA was forwardly placed to lay up close early on while racing three wide and weakened in the drive. MIA ROSA showed good early speed to
set the pace from the inside and gave way in the lane. DOLCISIMA dropped back early, raced three wide near the quarter pole and never was a factor. A
TOUCH OF SPADGET settled off the early going, raced towards the inside and had no response. TIPHARAH failed to sustain a bid.

ITS OVER stalked the early pace, moved up four wide at the three sixteenths pole and drove clear in the final stages. REGAL HOLIDAY was quick to begin
to set the early pace along the inside but was no match for the winner in the drive. BROADWAY RUCKUS stalked the pace from the outside, moved up
three wide through the lane and had not enough for the top pair. CHAPEL OF DREAMS was allowed to settled early on, raced five wide into the upper
stretch and had no final winning bid. PELLEGRINI was slow early on, raced three to four wide and and had no late rally. THEJIGISUP settled off the early
going, saved ground and had no late response. PAYITO tracked the early leader, challenged around the far turn and failed to sustain a bid through the
stretch run.

four wide near the three sixteenths pole and raced evenly late. SAYOH was off slowly, raced three wide in the lane and had no response. IRAZU dropped

the early lead from the inside and couldn't match strides with the winner late to finish second best. COMMODORE BARRY dropped back early, moved up
four wide near the quarter pole and had no final winning bid. OUR DESTINY dueled with Jura early on and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. JAMA
DILLON dropped back to the back of the pack early, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths pole but had not enough in the drive. ABE HONESTLY
stalked the pace, raced along the inside and had no late response. BEE BY THE SEA dropped back early, raced towards the inside and never was a factor.
STRAIGHTOUTADUTTON stalked early on and weakened in the drive. KONA KAI was getting out around the far turn into the upper stretch and never
threatened. The photo finish was estimated by tape delay by equibase.
