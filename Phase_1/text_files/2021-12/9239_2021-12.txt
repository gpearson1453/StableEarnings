Footnotes
BACHELOR PAD in hand up the backstretch along the inside, crept a bit closer late in the turn, briefly waited behind the leaders, slipped thru rail, dueled
final furlong, proved narrowly best in game fashion. SEAU forwardly placed while outside, came four wide into the stretch, dueled outside the winner to the
wire, outfinished by that rival while clear of the others. CABOT back off the pace toward the inside, two path into the lane while in some traffic, staged a mild
rally to be along for the show. BEBOP SHOES dueled up front closest to the inside, was beginning to tire when allowing the winner the rail in upper stretch,
continued to falter. NEWS BOX lacked speed after steadying early, came four wide into the stretch, failed to muster a rally. DR. FORMAN broke out, void of
early foot, came five wide out of the turn, also lacked a response to remain back. PAST POST dueled up front off the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
PRINCESS LILLI BUG with the pace from the start, vied three wide and between foes into the turn, narrowly showed the way nearing the furlong grounds
while remaining between horses, slightly larger lead late, held the runner up narrowly safe in the waning strides. DUTCH TREAT broke back, lacked speed,
two path late turn, moved out a bit for the drive, dove toward the inside inside the furlong marker when rallying, continued willingly to the wire to miss.
TIGER BAIT set or forced the pace up the backstretch in the two path and between horses, narrowly showed the way into the lane, gave ground grudgingly.
TAPIT RIGHT in the second flight early, loomed a threat while four wide midway on the turn, flattened out a bit in the drive. EURO ME bothered a bit at the
start to be last away, back early, improved four wide into the stretch and also failed to sustain that advance to the finish. MY GRACE broke in to bother a
couple of rivals, lacked speed, four to five wide turn, lacked a closing response. SPURWINK LANE in mid pack early, raced in traffic late in the turn, came
up empty when clear for the drive. DENALI ROCKET was finished after three furlongs. LADY PRIEST pushed in start, raced back and outside, four wide
into the lane, failed to threaten. SARAHS HOME brief speed inside, gave way late in the turn along the rail.

Footnotes
HOPING FOR A RING steered abruptly to the inside early, saved ground turn, waited briefly exiting the bend, slipped through along the inside to challenge,
dueled to the finish, proved best in determined fashion. TAKE CHARGE ERICA broke alertly, vied up front closest to the inside up the backstretch and into
the turn, got out a bit late in the bend allowing the winner the inside, dueled with that foe to the wire, outkicked in the late going, clearly second best.
SOPHIE'S ANGEL back off the pace toward the inside early, angled out five wide turning for home while between horses, rallied mildly for the show while
not a serious threat to the top two. BID FOR POWER broke back, raced outside, fanned six wide turning for home, improved position. DIVA DE KELA with
the pace three wide for a half, tired in the drive. FABLES LOVE AFFAIR last away, trailed much of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a
serious threat. BETCHA chased the runner up early, vied with that one and two others while between horses early in the turn, gave way in the drive. LIL
MISS HOT MESS moved closer four wide early in the turn, faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
IZZYBELLA lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, rallied up the rail to be clear at the end. ROCK STAR PARKING in the second flight outside,
advanced four wide to reach a challenging position by late in the turn, put a head in front soon after, could not contain the winner, remained clear for the
place. SAPPHIRE ROYALTY narrowly set the pace while along the inside, two path late in the turn, vied between the top two past the furlong marker,
weakened, saved the show. LICHITA broke on top, pressed the pace on the outside, gradually weakened through the stretch. ATHENAS SONG fell back to
trail, swung out out widest exiting the turn, improved position down the middle of the strip with some belated interest. PARKIN IN THE REAR off a step slow,
raced back and outside, four wide into the stretch, flattened out a bit in the final furlong. LADY SHAMAN in the second flight while between horses, had little
for the drive. CHAKRA pressed the issue for a half and gave way. TAKE CHARGE WOMAN steadily faded while racing toward the inside. PRESLEY gave
way midway on the turn.

Footnotes
DARE ME with the pace in the run up the backstretch inside, narrowly showed the way through the turn and into the stretch, edged clear nearing the furlong
marker while drifting out slightly, and slowly increased advantage under steady handling. ZMUDA never far back while outside, moved closer four to five
wide by late in the turn, appeared to come in slightly under a right handed crop when straightened for home, could not get to the winner late, proved
determined for the place. RACEDAY ATTIRE brushed at the start, raced in the second flight, moved closer in traffic late in the turn, split foes into the lane,
closest to the winner past the furlong marker, outkicked late for the place. MISS YUM YUM vied up front early while between horses, continued to vie
through the turn, gradually weakened through the stretch while being slightly bothered by the winner a furlong out. BLAME NELLIE forwardly placed early
along the inside, shuffled back a bit along the rail into the turn, moved closer in some traffic late in the bend, went evenly through the stretch when clear.
EMITYAAZ broke back, dropped inside, lacked speed, continued to save ground into the stretch, angled out and improved. KEEN CONTENDER broke
back, raced four wide late in the turn, improved a bit into the lane then lacked a further response. PURRFECT MISTRESS forwardly placed while between
horses despite steadying slightly, four wide and in traffic entering the stretch, steadied soon after and began to fade. WILD BIZNESS off slowly, trailed while
outside, four to five wide late in the turn when improving a bit, not a real threat. GAME OF INCHES was finished early while racing outside. PACIFIC
GROVE gave way in the turn, stopped and was jogged in far back. ROWDY DAISY set or forced the pace while between horses, appeared to clip heels
while in traffic upper stretch, unseated rider. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY OF THE STRETCH RUN, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.
A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF MISS YUM YUM AGAINST THE WINNER WAS ALSO NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
COMO SQUARE well back off the early pace toward the inside, angled out when advancing late in the turn, reached the leaders past the furlong marker and
kicked clear soon after then was fully extended to hold the runner up safe late. TORTE also outrun early, steered out three wide behind the winner turning
for home, shifted out a bit to be widest for the drive, finished with good late energy to be getting to the winner late. HOLY JUSTICE broke sharp, fell back off
the early pace, went one paced while racing up the inside. NO DRAMA MOMMA fell back to trail after the start, in the two path turning for home, improved
position to the wire with some belated interest. LADY SCARLET bothered slightly at the start, helped set the pace for five furlongs inside, weakened.
PARLANCE with the pace while racing three wide, tired from between horses the final furlong. TONE IT UP made little impact while racing three wide.
MARR TIME fractious in the gate, broke in to bother LADY SCARLET, was straightened to vie outside that foe and between horses for a half then backed
up quickly in the drive.

Footnotes
TRUCULENT cleared into the first turn, rated when setting a pressured pace up the backstretch and into the far turn, asked into the lane, shook clear, kept
to task. CATDADDY steered out to be three wide by late in the first turn, continued outside, moved closer in the three path second turn, proved no match for
the winner the final furlong. LUCK OF THE DRAW in the second group while between horses the middle half, lacked a closing kick in the drive. SHORTLIST
void of speed, moved closer in the three path midway on the final turn, steered in a bit entering the stretch, finished up evenly. ESKENFORIT chased the
winner for six furlongs and then weakened in the drive. LEADER OF MEN off a step slow, improved position. FIRST LINE went one paced while racing three
wide throughout. JOLTING JOE off a step slow, failed to threaten. UNITED PATRIOT off slowly, moved up and settled off the pace toward the inside, gave
way after a half.

Footnotes
CADDO RIVER away in good order, raced behind the leader first turn after moving off the inside, dropped back to the rail under a snug hold midway on that
bend, steadied when rank soon after, in hand, boxed 2nd turn in the two path, moved out widest for room when uncovered entering the stretch, rallied,
lugged in late to bump ATOKA, narrowly outkicked that one at the wire. ATOKA in the second group early, angled out to be four wide when advancing late in
the final turn, took over, led late, bumped final strides, missed. HIGHESTDISTINCTION settled early off the pace and the inside, advanced and lodged a
three wide bid in the second turn, failed to sustain that effort in the drive. DEFENDER away in good order, sprinted clear into the first turn, showed the way
by daylight in the run up the backstretch, responded when confronted in the second turn, continued to vie past the furlong marker, weakened late. WHAT A
COUNTRY lacked speed, came three wide out of the final turn, failed to make an impact through the lane. MOLIERE void of speed, remained back and
toward the inside. IRISH UNITY broke on top, allowed the leader to go early, chased that one up the backstretch, advanced and challenged briefly in the
second turn, gave way in the drive when the real running began in upper stretch.FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE
RIDER OF ATOKA AGAINST CADDO RIVER FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND
PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
BASEBALL POLITICS bothered at the start, recovered to race forwardly placed outside up the backstretch, four wide bid midway on the turn, put a head in
front turning for home, drove clear then held the runner up safe late. RIBBONS AND MEDALS void of speed off the inside, three wide into the bend before
angling six wide by late in the turn, set down and finished willingly while well out in the strip. A C EXPRESSWAY steadied at the break to be off slowly,
trailed turn, steered out when beginning to advance, rallied, dropped back inside and was going well at the end as well. EASTSIDE COOL in the second
flight along the inside, raced in traffic late in the turn, tipped out three wide for the drive, improved positoin. ALL THE DIAMONDS broke back, raced four
wide into the lane, improved position while too late. IMA BLING CAT broke in, bothered the winner, raced within striking distance outside, closer five wide in
the turn, flattened out in the drive. DEFLATER vied up front while racing three wide, weakened. OUTLIER back off the early pace, lacked a response in the
drive. FREUDIAN FATE narrowly set the pace for a half while between foes, faltered in the drive. DEVIL'S TOWER helped set the pace closest to the inside
four four furlongs and also backed up through the stretch. VIOLENT GIGI finished early, trailed home.
