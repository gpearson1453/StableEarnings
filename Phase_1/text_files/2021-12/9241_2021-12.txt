Footnotes
MY SWEET SOPHIA stalked the leaders in the early part, moved up on the outside around the turn, rallied down the lane and was going away at the end.
POINT ME OUT broke out, vied for the lead, saved ground around the turn, couldn't match strides with the winner late, but was best of others. MY GAL
CHARLOTTE raced in the middle of the field, made a late bid and proved no match for the top two. MT HOPY raced within contention, put forth an even
effort and lacked a late kick. WORLD OF HURT lacked early speed, came around the turn wide and gained ground. DIAMONDS SHINING raced near the
back in the beginning, improved position, but was no factor. ZIPITY challenged on the front end in the beginning, saved ground around the turn and faded.
MISS EMMA JEAN void of early speed, came around the turn wide and was never a threat. SWIFT N' STORMY always raced near the back and was
outrun. KELLIE MAE pressed the early pace and dropped back.

Footnotes
RITHMICALLEA pressed the early pace, eased back, rallied late and was just up. WINE TO ROSES raced near back in the beginning, had an outside trip,
took the lead at the head of the home stretch and held on for the win. DREAMER'S DELIGHT raced in the back of the pack, came around the second turn
on the outside, made a bid and got up for show. LOST GOLD lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. PALIMONIUM dueled on the front
end in the early going and faded. PRIME CODE showed early speed, saved ground around the final turn and was finished early. ESCROW STYLE was an
early factor, dropped back and finished wide.

Footnotes
TEXAS RULE broke poorly, racing in the back, moved up wide down the backside, rallied around the final turn on the outside, pulled away down the lane
and won under steady urging. HAIL SOUTHERN vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, saved ground around the final turn, proved no match
for the winner, but was best of others. MAX BET dueled on the front end, weakened and proved no match for the top two. BOBBY BOOTS raced near the
middle of the pack, eased back, saved ground around the second turn, made a mild bid, but was no factor. MR LEO raced in the middle of the pack, made a
bid and hung. RIVER KING challenged for the lead, faded, finished wide and was no threat late. SUGARLAND EXPRESS raced evenly near the back and
showed little. DAVID'S GRACE void of early speed, came around the final turn wide and was never a threat. DRIVER always raced near the back and
showed little.

running IT'SFIFTYSHADETIME. BOW BOW GIRL unhurried in the early going, raced outside around the final turn, made a late bid and was a clear third at
the wire. PUYE TIMING sprinted to the front, drove clear, saved ground and faded. MISS CHARLIE SIOUX void of early speed, finished wide and was never

Footnotes
FREEDOMFI void of early speed, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a late rally, racing six wide and proved the best late. HARDCORE
FOLKLORE lacked early speed, had an outside trip, made a late bid, five wide and was outfinished. MUSCADINE raced in the back of the field in the
beginning, moved up quickly down the backstretch, got throughout on the rail around the final turn, took the lead, but couldn't hold off the top two down the
lane. WISE VERDICT raced in the middle of the field, split rivals down the home stretch and finished willingly. MISTS OF TIME hopped at the start, racing
near the back, moved up, within striking striking distance and faded. LOVER BOY went to the front, drove clear and was finished early. CHOP CHOP
CHARLIE raced within contention, saved ground around the final turn and made a steady retreat. FLASHING ANGELBABY flashed early speed and
retreated to the back.

Footnotes
NOJOKEIMBROKE pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout, made a bid down the stretch, ran by VOYANT and pulled away. VOYANT went to
the front, drove clear, proved no match late for the winner, but was best of others. DA'MONEY ALARM bumped at the start, racing near the back, rushed up
down the backside, steadied, racing rank and proved a clear third at the wire. KANNON WITH A K lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no
factor. HARD TWIST raced near the back in the beginning, made a bid and hung. RODESSA FLASH raced evenly near the middle of the pack and was
never a factor. SWEET ROCKET raced in the middle of the field and weakened. PUTTER void of early speed and was never a threat. SUM HOLIDAY broke
out, raced in the middle of the pack and faded. CLASSIC RED RACER vied on the front end, saved ground around the turn and dropped back.
