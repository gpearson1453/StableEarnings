Footnotes
MAJESTIC WAYS vied for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the home stretch and proved the best late. SANGRIA CITY
challenged for the early lead, saved ground, dueled down the lane, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of rest. AVENDORE reluctant to load,
pressed the pace, saved ground and proved no match for the top two. REMEMBERIN RONALD void of early speed, made a steady gain and was
outfinished for show. AMERICAN REALITY raced near the middle of the field, came around the first turn six wide, moved up, but was no factor. SPEED
QUEEN broke well, eased back and was no threat late. PERPETUATE raced evenly near the back and lacked a bid. TAYLORS BABE always raced near
the back and showed little. HEY SISSY raced in the middle of the pack and dropped back.

Footnotes
LOVE TO LEARN unhurried in the early part, made a late bid, drifted in down the home stretch and drove clear before the wire. BAR TAP vied for the early
advantage, forwardly placed throughout, checked down the final stretch, to avoid down rival and was a clear second at the wire. KRIS T. void of early speed,
had an outside trip, checked late to avoid down rival and proved no match for the top two. GEORGIA DAWN raced within contention, steadied late, made a
mild bid, but was no factor. MEMORY MAGIC dueled on the front end, saved ground and faded. LULUMARU raced in the middle of the field, weakened,
finished wide and was no threat. MINJI raced within striking distance, came around the second turn wide and dropped back. FIRST EMPRESS unhurried in
the early part, moved up between rivals around the final turn, made a bid down the stretch, clipped heels with LOVE TO LEARN, fell and lost rider, walked
off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS CALLED INTO THE RUNNING OF THE RACE.. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED #6 LOVE
TO LEARN FROM FIRST AND PLACED HER LAST FOR INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH.

MISSGREELEY'SSONG vied for the early lead, took command around the final turn, pulled away and won handily. C. F. SHELAUH unhurried in the early
part, made a steady gain, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. GIFTED TALENT lacked early speed, came around the second turn on
the outside, made a wide gain and got up for third. ABIGAIL G raced near the middle of the field, made a bid and was outfinished for show. MISS MIRACLE
GIRL challenged for the early, saved ground and faded. SHE'S OUR STAR lacked early speed, improved position, finished wide and was no factor. MISS
MABELEE broke out, dueled on the front end, saved ground and faded. WIND ZEE raced in the middle of the field, came around the first turn on the outside
and dropped back. KOHENSRISING pressed the pace and made a steady retreat. SMOOTHOUTTHETRACK brushed at the start, raced in the back and
was never close.
