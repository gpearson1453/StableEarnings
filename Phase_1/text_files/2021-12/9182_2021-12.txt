saved early ground then bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, angled six wide into the lane and dug in to take third
the final strides. SWING YOUR SWORD stalked in the three path leaving the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole and took the
lead three wide approaching the quarter, drifted into the lane, was caught past the eighth pole then flattened late stretch. DEJOHN stalked off the rail then
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, dueled to a slim brief lead between horses past the five sixteenths pole, continued close at the rail to
mid-stretch then flattened later yards. SUSPIROS settled just off the pace inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three
path, drifted to the six path nearing the head of the lane then flattened the final sixteenth. HIGH PRINT saved ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving
the half mile pole, ran in the seven and eight paths of the far turn then flattened. TRUE CROSSING rounded the opening turn in the five path, raced outside

Footnotes
STORMIN ROCKET took quick control and rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, contested the advantage off the rail
on the far turn and was steadily encouraged to widen. WITH SECRET ENERGY raced boxed at the rail the opening turn, picked up the chase nearing the
three eighths pole, raced close through the far turn and dueled clear of WHAT AN OX mid-stretch. The latter stalked off the rail, started a bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole and raced close in the three path of the far turn, then flattened while ceding second mid-stretch. LATE IN THE GAME saved ground
off the pace, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly down the lane. MOVED BY JUBA was
bumped while five wide into the first turn, picked up the chase into the backstretch, ran at the rail on the far turn then flattened stride. ANGELA'S ROMEO
rounded the first turn about the five path, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response. SPECTACULO stalked from three path
the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn still in the three path then weakened. JUBA'S MONEY HONEY raced well off
the pace. PULL UP MY SOCKS was roughed and angled out from the heels of With Secret Energy into the first turn, made contact with Moved By Juba at

Footnotes
SPUNKY ALI CAT took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled to hold on well. MACKENZIE'S STAR settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then dug in through the stretch to take second the final strides. BUFF N stalked
off the rail, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close through the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane but was nipped from second the
final strides. SO RED THE ROSE saved ground through the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the
rail, angled out mid-stretch and finished evenly. PARTLY DANDY rounded the first turn in the five path, started a bid past the five sixteenths pole, raced at
the rail on the far turn and finished evenly. RUN ON ENERGY settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, eased outward into the backstretch and
showed little response. HOUSE OF LOVE rated off the early pace inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then weakened at the rail on the far
turn. BOCA BIRDIE was never a factor.

Footnotes
FIBER AND EMILY angled to the inside to rate the pace, was hand ridden into the far turn, came under a drive nearing the head of the lane, was steadily
handled to late stretch, then taken in hand nearing the wire. ELLIE'S LIL MAN stalked the winner then chased from the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn off the rail, though couldn't improve in the lane. AWSOME FAITH settled back off the rail the opening turn then eased out with a bid into the
backstretch, ran in the four path of the far turn and dug in from the head of the lane to take the nod for third under the wire. CAYENNE CREEK saved
ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, drifted a bit into the lane and missed the nod for third
under the wire. OPERA NITE rounded the first turn off the rail, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened
stride. OWEN'S WAY entered the first turn about the four path then moved to the inside midway through the turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole,
raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little further. BLACK STEEL stalked in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole
then faded into the far turn. RUSH TO THE CASTLE raced outside into the backstretch and showed little response. GRUMPELSTILTSKIN became a bit
fractious just before the break then broke rank and lost his rider leaving the gate. The Stewards flashed the inquiry to review the start of this race.

Footnotes
EVENT PARTY raced well back from early contention on the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, steadily improved in the four path of the far
turn then closed quickly under steady encouragement to get up the final strides. COWBOY AT HEART stalked off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole and moved to even terms two deep midway on the far turn, dug in determinedly to win the nod for second but was nipped
for the win in the final strides. LIKE SEGAL stalked the early pace two deep, moved to even terms into the backstretch and dueled to put Dialing Dixie away
approaching the far turn, was met at the rail midway through the turn and dug in gamely to late stretch before relenting; grudgingly. ELVIRUS settled off the
pace inside, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and finished evenly. HAPPY CHARLIE rounded the opening
turn about the six path and raced outside into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn then flattened
stride. DIALING DIXIE angled to the inside to set the early pace, was met into the backstretch and dueled from that point, but dropped back toward the
quarter pole and faded through the far turn. FLAVA'S DREAM rounded the opening turn about the five path and showed little response through the
backstretch. DASHING CIRCLES settled off the pace about the four path, gave chase toward the three eighths pole then weakened in the three path of the
far turn. HARTEL raced off the pace about the four path on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then weakened in the six path of the far
turn.

Footnotes
COMMAND THE CAT rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge near the rail on the far turn, drifted
a bit toward the head of the lane and gave up the lead past the eighth pole, but dug in from that point to recover the edge under the wire. WILLIAM AND
MARY settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and improved at the rail on the far turn, dueled for the lead
inside the eighth pole and was steadily encouraged through the lane, but relented the nod in the final stride. FANCY CONCHO settled off the rail on the
opening turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and finished well. CANDY INVASION saved ground on the first turn, bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, eased outward through the upper stretch and finished well while gaining on the top
three. BOSS E BOOGS raced with the pace, challenged and took a slim lead between calls toward the seven sixteenths pole, contested the far turn at a
close disadvantage two deep on the far turn but dropped back toward the head of the lane and weakened. OUT OF CENTS settled off the rail the first turn
then stalked three wide into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then weakened. ALLEN CAN
DO IT rounded the first turn about the three path then stalked four wide into the backstretch, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, ran in the
four path of the turn then weakened. AARON'S TAP broke a step slow and rounded the first turn in the four path, left the turn outside and gave chase
leaving the three eighths pole, then weakened in the four path of the far turn.
