Footnotes
IF YOU WANT IT settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore with a furlong to run
and drew off with complete authority. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths
pole, gained a brief lead but was no match for the winner. SHES GOT THE POWER lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and
finished with a steady rally. DANCE FIGHTER was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, angled out with a furlong to run and gave
way. GOLDEN GODDESS settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and failed to rally. GUARDING ELK CAMP was forwardly placed early, moved
four-wide through the second turn and weakened. KISSABLE U raced five-wide through both turns, settled off the leaders and weakened. OUT OF THE
SKY showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
GAGE HAS A GRAY was away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter and drew off as a
handy winner. AUTISM SIBLINGS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out nearing the quarter and
finished with a steady bid. JU JU GUY lagged early, saved ground through the second turn and finished with some late run. OBSTRUCTED VIEW sprinted
clear at once, increased his advantage through the back-stretch and weakened after going three-quarters. WESTERN SMOKE settled off the leaders early,
moved four-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. FORT YORK was void of early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not
threaten.

drive. WARRIORS HERO lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. ALPINE HYPNOSIS showed no early speed,
saved ground through the second turn and did not menace. A GEM IS A GEM raced four-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders early, moved
five-wide through the second turn and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

CHEWY CHEWY GOOD was away in good order to dispute the pace with APRILINTHEPINES while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the
three-eighths marker and drew off as a handy winner. MONGOLIAN EMPIRE chased the leaders while racing three-wide, could not gain on the winner in
the drive but finished well to hold the place. AVISSE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the lane and
finished willingly. LOVE YA MOST raced off the pacesetters from between foes, saved ground through the second turn and lacked the needed late
response. JAZZY EINSTEIN was off a step slow, settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. HEART RIVER
showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn, angled in with a furlong to run and did not offer a bid. APRILINTHEPINES was away in
good order to duel for the lead with the winner from the inside, weakened after going a half and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
A NEW TREND was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and edged clear. JEN
LORS LEGACY pressed the pace while racing four-wide, could not match strides with the winner late but finished with a steady bid. FREIBURG was away
alertly to duel for the lead while racing two-wide and gave way grudgingly in the drive. SUCCESS RATE broke sharply to dispute the pace with FRIEBURG
and gave way through the final furlong. OUTLAW BY NATURE was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. SPIRIT
MISSION lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. WILD WILD KINGDOM was void of early foot, raced four-wide through
the turn and did not offer a bid. TACKSON was off a step slow, lagged early, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. DAVID NOSE BEST raced
off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened.
