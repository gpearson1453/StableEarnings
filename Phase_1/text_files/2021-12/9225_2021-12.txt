Footnotes
SEA PINES sped to the early lead, saved ground on the turn, drifted wide in upper stretch and was kept under urging in the drive. DAILY PLANET stalked
the pace off the rail on the turn, swung wide approaching the stretch and rallied outside the winner. MIDDLE ISLAND bobbled at the break, advanced three
deep on the turn and weakened in upper stretch. SAPPHIRE BEAUTY lacked speed, swung wide leaving the turn and failed to be a factor. MELIPONINI
BEE raced in the three path entering the stretch and lacked a rally. LEGS LIKE SHACK bore out at the break, prompted the pace outside the winner and
gave way. CUENCA hugged the inner rail, chased the pace and gave way leaving the turn. PARTY MONSTER stumbled leaving the starting gate, raced
along the inner rail and retreated. LOTTACLASS LILSASS was outrun.

Footnotes
MISS CHESAPEAKE settled off the pace while saving ground, eased out leaving the far turn, gathered momentum and rolled up four wide into the stretch,
leveled off and forged to command leaving the eighth pole, eagerly widened and was kept alert. LONG DISTANCE LOVE prompted the pace three wide
outside BETCHA BY GOLLY, moved to apply more pressure into the turn, secured command past the three eighths, edged clear into the lane, was joined
nearing mid stretch and continued willingly to be clearly second best. FOOL YOURSELF , four wide outside rivals, was under pressure pursuing mid turn but
failed to drum up a legitimate stretch kick. BETCHA BY GOLLY moved up to clear leaving the chute, set the pace two wide, took outside pressure into the
turn, sparred briefly past the three and a half marker, stayed willingly to the three sixteenths then gave way. CONGRESS HALL saved ground while in range
early, was under pressure mid turn and faded. MISTY'S BANSHEE , three wide early, was under asking leaving the far turn and failed to respond. DOUBLE
FIREBALL broke a step slow, was sent up between foes, chased off the rail and faltered entering the lane.

CANTAKEITANYMORE , well off the early pace while saving some ground, came under a ride leaving the far turn, angled out and advanced five wide into
the stretch, moved up and collared HASHTAG WINNING from his outside with a furlong to go, dueled on near even terms, exchanged a brush and got the
bob after a hard fought drive. HASHTAG WINNING settled off the runaway leader, steadily advanced four deep into the far turn, continued progress and
moved to a slim lead past the five sixteenths, briefly shook clear under pressure near the three sixteenths, dug in when confronted, battled gamely to the
inside of the winner after being brushed and just missed. GO POKE THE BEAR rated three wide, moved up into the far turn, bid between foes past the three
eighths, dueled past the five sixteenths, gave hard chase after giving up some ground in upper stretch then continued with effort. UNEQUIVOCAL , off the
pace while saving ground, angled out into the lane, shifted back in to move up in mid stretch then flattened out. BRICKBAT stalked the pace, moved up two
wide past the half mile marker, sparred between runners leaving the five sixteenths, stayed willingly to the sixteenth marker then faded. ALPHA QUEUE
opened up early, set the pace towards the inside, was collared leaving the far turn, stayed on to the three sixteenths then angled out when put in close.
CRUSH IT rushed up to contention into the first turn then was rated back off the leader, dropped in to saved ground, edged up some leaving the far turn
then weakened. An objection by the rider of BRICKBAT against GO POKE THE BEAR for alleged interference in the stretch was not allowed

FRAUDULENT CHARGE was steadied in the opening sixteenth, regrouped and pulled her way forward five wide and between foes, dropped in a path and
bid four deep in hand mid turn, secured command into the lane, spurted clear under asking past the three sixteenths then eagerly pulled away while kept
alert. AMERICAN BASTET prompted the pace three wide, bid between foes leaving the far turn, disputed the pace past the five sixteenths, dropped back a
bit leaving the three sixteenths but kept on with decent energy to reclaim the place in the final yards. ITALIAN DRESSING , brushed at the start, settled off
the pace while saving ground, eased out to advance between foes near the quarter pole, swung five wide for the drive, straightened and closed steadily.
AWAY TO RETURN showed a nice burst from the inside to take over early and go clear, set a rated pace towards the rail, handled outside pressure leaving
the far turn, sparred inside a pair of rivals past the five sixteenths, stayed on willingly past the furlong grounds then gave way grudgingly in the final yards.
HOPE HAS A NAME , six wide outside foes early on, was urged four to five wide chasing the duelers past the five sixteenths, moved up some past mid
stretch then flattened out. SHE'SAROLLINGSTONE saved ground under asking mid turn and lacked a bid. FRIEND ME CHARLIE , forwardly placed four
wide, was ridden along leaving the far turn, failed to keep pace, dropped back and was reported by the stewards to have bled. MOONROCK broke a step
slow then was brushed, rushed up leaving the five eighths, bid two wide between runners exiting the far turn, battled to mid turn then surrendered.
SALAMINA failed to keep pace and raced six wide into the lane.

Footnotes
JOE settled well wide outside rivals and off of a contested pace, moved up about four to five mid turn, came six wide into the stretch, leveled off under a
drive and switched over to his correct lead near mid stretch, forged to command outside foes soon after, kicked clear and held firm. ALOTTAHOPE broke a
step slow then rushed up inside rivals to gain a forward spot, tracked towards the rail around the turn, eased out and edged up behind foes nearing mid
stretch, altered back in and kept on gamely to gain the place. COASTAL MISSION , three to four wide stalking the pace, was under urging mid turn and
came back on through the final furlong. MR. MOX dueled to the inside of a pair of foes, gained a short lead past the five sixteenths, was guided off the rail
while battling with LOCAL MOTIVE into the stretch, kicked clear after being set down, could not contain the winner heading to the sixteenth pole then gave
way grudgingly. LOCAL MOTIVE , in hand between rivals disputing the early pace, emerged in a fight to the outside of MR. MOX into the lane, stayed
willingly past mid stretch then faded late. ONE TEN drafted back off the early pace, edged up between foes then checked sharply nearing the three furlong
pole, swung wide for the drive and finished with good energy. CRABS N BEER , between rivals early, gave chase in range two wide past the quarter pole
but failed to kick on past the three sixteenths. SHADY MUNNI rated between foes early, came four wide for the drive and lacked a bid. KOBE TOUGH , off a
bit slow, saved ground off the pace, steadied briefly nearing the lane and faded. UNCLE IRISH , off the pace, raced five wide into the stretch and was not a
threat. ROYAL SPY stumbled at the break, regrouped and moved up between foes, dueled three deep to mid turn then gave way. GALLANT GOLD , five
and four wide, raced close up off the duel mid turn, failed to seriously kick on in upper stretch, steadied soon after, dropped back and was reported by the
stewards to have bled.

Footnotes
HAIR OF THE DOG , snugly rated off the early duel leaving the backstretch, angled to the four path approaching the stretch, swept to command outside
horses approaching the eighth pole and held sway. CHAUFFEUR lacked speed, was four wide leaving the turn and rallied outside foes. LITTLE SIR JOHN
lacked speed, raced in the three path in upper stretch, was outside horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. HANDS DOWN hugged the inner rail,
disputed the pace to the eighth pole and faded. ALBERTANO disputed the pace outside HANDS DOWN and weakened. BALTIMORE WINNING was not a
factor. R TAP saved ground on the turn and gave way. EFFULGENT showed speed three deep and faltered leaving the turn.
