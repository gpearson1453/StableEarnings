Footnotes
JUNIOR BUG well rated to turn, angled out into stretch, took over in the final furlong and lasted to the wire under stout handling. RANDELLO chased to turn,
angled three wide past the quarter pole while all out in the stretch to just miss the place spot. T J MUNNINGS had an awkward start, floated out widest past
the quarter pole and angled in the stretch to rally along for the place spot. ILLBOOTENGOTTY well placed never far back, four wide run into stretch,
flattened. FARZIN never in contention. RAULITO slow into stride, floated widest into the stretch, improved late. ALTERNATE NIGHTS failed to menace.
ARCHIE CAN'T SELL sharp speed to the front, used up to the turn, stopped. GOLD INCENSE pressed pace inside to turn, gave way readily. EL
CASADORA never menaced.

Footnotes
SLIP SLIDING AWAY good speed to the front, stayed clear good handling, much best. EPONA BAY inside trip throughout, no match for winner, best of the
rest. FITS THE JILL stalked leaders three wide with no late kick in the stretch. BAYOU WIND bothered start, raced evenly with no response in the drive.
DIBBLE DIBBLE bothered start, never factored. HENRIETTA TOPHAM inside trip with no late response when needed. MISS MCBRIDE chased leader, put
to drive far turn, came up empty. SKYBOX failed to menace. KANGAROO TALK got loose in the post parade then stumbled badly from the gate with no
chance thereafter.
