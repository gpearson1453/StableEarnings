wide. DIALED UP in close after the break tracked evenly to upper stretch gaining a bit of position late near mid track. PABLO'S QUEST slow early lost
ground to upper stretch finishing evenly eight wide. PATHWAY TO VICTORY broke sharply pressing the pace dueling through the turn ceding to rival in
upper stretch fading late. PROOF OF PARANOIA chased the pace saving ground to upper stretch tiring there along the rail. REDMARK played no factor.
