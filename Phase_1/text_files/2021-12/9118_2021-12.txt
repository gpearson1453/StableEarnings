Footnotes
PADRINO'S HEART stalked from the three path then took the lead three wide past the seven sixteenths pole, drew clear nearing the five sixteenths,
rounded the far turn at the rail, drifted a bit into the stretch and just lasted under steady handling. CASTLE BOUND saved ground on the first turn then bid
into the backstretch, eased outward toward the head of the lane and left the turn three wide, was squeezed and bumped by Wonder How nearing
mid-stretch but dug in from that point and just missed. LIL BITTY ROAD stalked in the four path the first turn, bid toward the three eighths pole, came
through the far turn still in the four path and dug in to take third later yards while outfinished for second. SUCCESSFUL ZIP saved ground on the opening
turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, eased slightly out leaving the turn and finished evenly. WONDER HOW raced
with the early pace two deep, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dropped back from between horses nearing the three eighths, ran in the three
path of the far turn, drifted into the stretch, came out to make contact with Castle Bound nearing mid-stretch then flattened stride. PECULIAR SENSATION
raced with the pace inside, was caught leaving the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, rounded the far turn near the rail and ran close
through the upper stretch before weakening the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
SHERIFF'S KID stalked off the rail and took over past the three eighths pole, raced clear toward the quarter, rounded the far turn at the rail and dug in under
steady encouragement to hold on. CREATE A STORY settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced close off the
rail on the far turn then dug in through the stretch to finish well at the outside girth of the winner. WILD CAPPUCINO rounded the opening turn in the three
and four paths then settled outside leaving the turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, continued on in the three and four paths of the far
turn and came along for third inside the eighth pole. ESTHER'S FORTUNE raced erratically early then saved ground on the opening turn, bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four and five paths and showed little more. RAISON D'ETAT GIRL saved early ground, picked up the
chase leaving the three eighths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn. MOLLY BOLTS raced well back off the rail the first turn and showed little
response through the backstretch. WHYCANTTHISBELOVE tapered in and took the lead nearing the three quarter pole, was caught past the three eighths,
gave chase from that point but steadied at the rail into the far turn then faded through the turn.

MAJESTIC SEAS pressured the pace through the backstretch and took the lead two deep at the quarter pole, drew clear midway on the turn and was
steadily handled to hold on well. BELMULLET gave chase through the backstretch, ran in the three path of the turn and finished well. BANNER MAN
chased, rounded the turn about the four path, came along for third mid-stretch and finished evenly. HELLO CARLO chased the pace inside, raced at the rail
on the turn then angled to the five path into the lane and passed rivals outside. STRONG SAFETY set a pressured pace inside, was headed at the rail at the
quarter pole, dropped back midway on the turn then weakened the final furlong. LUNAR PRAYER gave chase, but jumped over a fallen rival causing his

FUDGE CAKE was forced outward and into Mikey's Jewel leaving the gate then stalked off the rail, challenged toward the three eighths pole, took the lead
two deep nearing the quarter, ran clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. GLORY MARCH saved ground off the pace, bid
approaching the three eighths pole, progressed at the rail on the far turn, angled four wide into the stretch, dug in for second mid-stretch and was gaining
steadily on the winner. HIGH GLORY angled in and took the lead at the thirteen sixteenths pole then rated the pace, came under pressure toward the three
eighths pole, was caught at the rail approaching the quarter, dropped back midway on the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth. MIKEY'S JEWEL was
shut off then bumped outward and into Ignition Key leaving the gate, saved ground off the pace, bid toward the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the

CRUZ IN THE CASTLE tapered to the inside and rated the pace, was given rein leaving the three eighths pole, widened under a hand ride nearest the rail
on the far turn then steadily encouraged to draw off through the lane. TINA'S SONG broke out to make contact with Quincys Way then settled just off the
pace inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail but proved no match in the lane. CHOPRA was jostled at the
break and rounded the opening turn about the three path, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, improved position in the three path of the far turn
and ran evenly in the lane. QUINCYS WAY was bumped at the break then saved ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the
far turn and finished evenly. CHARITABLE MISS broke outward to make contact with Chopra then settled off the rail the first turn, eased out into the
backstretch and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and showed little more. MASTERDANCER settled off the
early pace about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole then weakened in the four path of the far turn. GATTOLOTTACHARM rounded the first
turn about the four path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then flattened stride widest on the far turn. SISTER JOANN broke in to make contact
with Chopra then stalked in the two and three paths, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded into the far turn.

Footnotes
MOMZA rated close inside, eased out with a bid leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead three wide past the quarter pole and was kept alert through the
lane. KINSALER stalked two deep and took the nod leaving the half mile pole, was headed at the rail past the quarter pole then dueled through the stretch
for second. ARE YOU HAPPY rated just off the pace and off the rail, started a three wide bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, drew to even terms toward
the quarter pole but was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. POSTINO'S STORY rounded the first turn in the six path and settled off the pace from
the seven eighths pole, bid nearing the three eighths, ran two deep on the far turn and showed little more. CLEVER BOB settled back off the rail, picked up
the chase into the backstretch, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little more. CARSON AND I rounded the opening turn about the seven path,
raced well back into the front stretch and showed little response through the backstretch. ITS MR POPPI TO U settled back inside and never factored. THE
FIRE WITHIN rated a slim lead inside, was met into the backstretch and gave chase from that point, then faded approaching the far turn. SURFING settled
just off the early pace about the three path then gave way into the far turn.
