K COTTEE bumped with UNCAPTURED FAITH at the start, pursued LADY YOUNES from outside, closed in late on the turn, wrested command into the
final furlong, and kept UNCAPTURED FAITH at a safe distance to the finish. UNCAPTURED FAITH bumped with K COTTEE at the start, improved position
three wide approaching the stretch, rallied outside the winner and was cutting into the margin late. LADY YOUNES angled over to the rail with a clear early
lead, could not hold off K COTTEE through the furlong grounds, and weakened. MUDSHAFT bumped with BRINGTHEWINE at the start, was outsprinted
two wide to the stretch, and failed to threaten while best of the remainder. PRETTYASPINK raced forwardly inside to the turn, and faded. BRINGTHEWINE
hit the left side of the gate and bumped with MUDSHAFT coming out, steadied behind FORGE AHEAD while at the back entering the turn, and remained far
behind. FORGE AHEAD moved off the rail directly in front of BRINGTHEWINE entering the turn, and was never close.

Footnotes
BIONIC BOTTLE sprinted to a clear lead and angled inside soon after the start, remained well clear and saved ground entering the lane, drifted out wider
under pressure in the upper stretch, held on to a diminishing lead in the final furlong and prevailed under a driving finish. CHARLOTTE THE BRIT raced
inside in pursuit of the early leader, angled out past the quarter pole, was set down four to five wide for the drive, edged up closer to BIONIC BOTTLE in
deep stretch but failed to get by. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE sat outside a rival and chased after the leader around the turn, sustained a steady bid toward the
inside in the lane and cleared the rest. PRETZEL was ridden along three wide through the turn, continued a bid along the outside in the lane and lacked the
needed response for impact. HENNI PENNY raced outside in the last flight, continued well off the pace into the lane and never threatened. SILVER
PACKAGE raced in the last flight, saved ground through the turn and had no response.

Footnotes
BETH'S DREAM set the pace in the two path, shook clear around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and drew off under minimal urging.
HUSTLE QUEEN prompted outside of the winner to upper stretch and was clearly second best in the lane. LATTE LOVER tracked the pace from the rail,
lacked a closing bid and held third. RAIN OF BLESSING was in range three and four wide and came up empty in the lane. MAGNA COLORS was outrun
inside. GILDED ASSET played no factor while racing three wide. ROYAL WINDS made little impact two wide.

Footnotes
JOE DI BAGGIO pressed FACE OF VICTORY along the inside early, dropped back awaiting an opening around the turn, found a seam between horses at
the top of the stretch, poked a head in front from outside with a furlong remaining, and prevailed all out. FACE OF VICTORY set a pressured pace in the
two-path, dug in when challenged by JOE DI BAGGIO turning for home, and battled on stubbornly to the finish. UNCORK THE BOTTLE was steered off the
rail soon after the start, advanced four wide to loom a threat outside the leaders with a quarter-mile to run, had aim through a long drive but needed more.
GANGLY moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and ran on one-paced outside. GAME BOY BENNY lodged a three-wide bid after a half-mile, but
flattened out through the drive. AEQUOR was outpaced after a half, and finished on his own courage.

Footnotes
FORTY FLASH pressed the pace around the first turn, dueled outside of TAPE TO TAPE up the backstretch, continued to battle into the stretch run, roused
forward to a slim lead in the final furlong, dug in gamely, turned back the bid from EL PECADO and held clear. EL PECADO was a bit tight along the rail
entering the first turn, tracked the embattled duo up the backstretch, headed in pursuit three wide past the quarter pole, stayed on three wide in close
contention and lacked the needed surge to move by. ALWAYS EDEN bumped with rival at the start, raced two wide through the first turn and remained
unhurried in the last flight, was ridden along the outside through the far turn, came four wide into the lane, stayed on with response and gained closer
contention. TAPE TO TAPE held a slim lead around the first turn, dueled inside of FORTY FLASH up the backstretch, continued to battle past the furlong
marker then failed to keep pace and gave way. BEAU BROWN settled and saved ground up the backstretch, came off the inside while urged through the far
turn, moved back inside in the lane and failed to kick on. OUTKICKTHECOVERAGE was a bit tight two wide entering the first turn, saved ground racing in
the last flight, cut the corner entering the lane and had no response. SPORTINI fanned four wide around the first turn, rated near midpack through early
stages, then weakened around the far turn.

Footnotes
NIKEE KAN tracked the pace three wide, steadily gained through the lane, seized command leaving the sixteenth pole and drew clear under a drive. BABY
MO set the pace along the rail, widened in upper stretch, led past the sixteenth pole, drifted very slightly near that marker and held the place. FOLLOW ME
MOM lacked early speed while racing two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and rallied through the lane to gain third late. WAR STAR stalked the
pace inside, tried to split rivals near the sixteenth pole, checked when unable to get through and went evenly from there. STARSHIP NANA raced off the
pace three and four wide and had a belated rally. HARPER'S IN CHARGE prompted the pace two wide and tried in the lane. WELL SHES HANDSOME was
outrun inside. NURSE JUDY had her head turned at the start, advanced outside early, raced four wide around the turn and faded. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH. RUN-UP
UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
OMNIA set the pace inside, dug in when challenged by PEARLESCENT after six furlongs, drifted out bumping lightly with that rival in upper stretch, received
a bump in return several strides later, and held firm for a hard-fought decision. PEARLESCENT tracked from close range early inside, moved out to take a
run at OMNIA approaching the stretch, exchanged light bumps with that rival through the lane and could not get by. RACE DAY SPEED was four wide into
the first turn before moving in a bit, had clear aim outside the battling leaders with a furlong remaining, and ran on evenly. DIAMOND PLAY was no menace
through a three-wide trip. LET'S BE HONEST was four wide throughout, and weakened after six furlongs. VITAEMI was finished early. AN OBJECTION BY
THE RIDER OF PEARLESCENT AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED. THIS RACE WAS
HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
SPRING THE BEAST applied pace pressure to CAJUN MADATE through early stages, loomed up to challenge rival leaving the turn, came four wide under
right handed pressure into the lane, roused forward to the lead near the furlong marker and widened advantage under steady urging. U U STAR shifted off
the inside in early stages, was ridden along three wide through the turn, remained outside in pursuit of SPRING THE BEAST through the lane and finished
second best. FRAN'S STRIKE hustled up for response around the turn, sustained a three wide bid through the lane and secured a share. INNER WAVE
raced outside off the early speed, swung five wide into the drive and needed more for late impact. PEMBERTON was off slow at the start, raced in the back,
saved ground into the lane and lacked a needed rally. CAJUN MANDATE set a pressured pace through early stages, was no match for the winner past
upper stretch and gave way. AREVALO showed response in opening stages then steadily retreated.
