Footnotes
HATCHET CREEK tracked along the inside, saved ground while waiting for room midway on the turn, found room on the rail nearing the furlong marker,
rallied to the front and drew clear under urging. IRISH TUFF was bumped at the start, chased three wide, bid four wide at the quarter pole, dueled in upper
stretch, dug in gamely and earned the place spot. MINISTRY OF ART was bumped at the start, raced two wide off the pace, came three wide into the lane
and rallied mildly for third. FINAL CALL was off a bit slow, outrun early, came wide entering the stretch, rallied mildly outside and was outfinished for the
show spot. KING'S STORY was bumped at the start, set the pace, dueled into the stretch and weakened. FLORIDA FLASH was bumped at the start, raced
three wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane, was steadied at the three sixteenths marker, then lacked a rally. BOLD ATTACK chased two wide, bid
three wide on the turn, dueled into the stretch and faded. LAST SPRING raced off the pace inside and did not factor. STAR OF STARS was bumped at the
start, chased between rivals and gave way.
