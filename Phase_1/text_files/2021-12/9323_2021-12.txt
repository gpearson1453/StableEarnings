Footnotes
ARRIVEDERLA broke readily to gain the advantage from the outset, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail to the turn, then was
driven clear through the stretch under firm right handed encouragement. DOODLE HOPPER was rated tracking just off the leaders off the inside racing to
the turn, angled to the rail entering the stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors late. BLACK V. K. was urged along three wide
pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, continued in that path to upper stretch and weakened in the drive. BANGOR RIDGE, in touch with the eventual winner
stalking that rival between foes racing to the turn, came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
GHOSTLORE, off a step behind the leaders, was urged to a forward placing between foes racing into the first turn, prompted the pacesetter through the
backstretch, edged forward of that foe midway through the far turn, then kicked away through the stretch, widening the advantage under firm left handed
encouragement. MINT sped to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace a bit off the rail on a narrow margin through the
backstretch, dueled inside the eventual winner for command into the far turn, proved no match entering the stretch but kept on well enough to prove best of
the others. M V SPEED was settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, advanced to contention four wide after a half, moved to lodge a three wide bid
racing into the far turn but flattened out in the drive. COASTAL WATERS was urged to contention three wide between foes racing into the first turn and
faded after a half. HARROW, caught four wide racing into the first turn, dropped back early.

Footnotes
TONY SMALL tracked the leaders three deep as part of the second flight racing through the backstretch, lost some ground to the pacesetter racing into the
turn, then produced a steady late response racing through the stretch to wrest the advantage in the closing stages under firm left handed pressure.
IMPERIAL BREW dictated the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch, moved clear on his own courage racing through the turn, held sway past
midstretch, then resisted the winner's bid in the closing stages while just failing to contain that rival. ZONIC, off bit slowly, was settled outside foes racing
through the backstretch, then continued evenly three deep between foes in the closing stages to prevail for a share in time. CHINOMADITO, held up
between foes in second flight racing through the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into the turn while being urged to lodge a brief bid, drifted out
racing into the stretch and steadily faded. GOLD WING was settled between foes just off the second flight in the opening stages, was prompted to advance
while angling to the rail entering the turn but came up empty in late stages. SAINT BENEVOLENCE, urged along the inside prompting the pacesetter in the
opening quarter, dropped back early. PICCADILLY BEAU tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight in the opening quarter, was shuffled back avoiding
tight quarters racing past the half mile marker and quickly dropped out.

and produced a solid closing response to wrest the advantage in time under firm handling. CHINA BEACH broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow
margin along the inside to the backstretch, edged forward racing into the far turn, resisted MONETIZED's challenge while being bumped by that foe in late
stages and prevailed for the place honors while failing to contain the winner. MONETIZED, pulling a bit stalking just off the pacesetter along the inside
racing to the backstretch, tipped outside that foe racing into upper stretch while being urged to advance, shifted inwards bumping CHINA BEACH in the
closing stages and was just outfinished for second. BLACK LIMO, reserved last along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn
and continued with interest inside rivals to gain position to the end. GRUNDER, reluctant to load in the starting gate, tracked off the second flight outside a
rival under light reserve racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into the stretch and continued evenly. EIGHT WEEKS LONG angled inwards
to track off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while shifting out four wide nearing upper stretch but had no
closing response. O DANNY BOY, urged prompting the pacesetter into the backstretch, lost terms with that foe on the far turn and gave way between foes
racing into upper stretch. MONITOR MILLS, reserved outside foes racing to the backstretch, dropped out early.

WATCH THE MUSIC ducked out at the start, was righted while pulling his rider under light rating to dictate the pace on a narrow advantage along the inside
to the backstretch, dispatched a rival to gain a clear advantage on the far turn, then turned back the challenge of LUDO racing through the stretch to prove
best under right handed pressure. The latter angled inwards leaving the chute to stalk just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, continued along the inside
into the far turn, tipped outside the leader nearing upper stretch while being urged to challenge that rival racing through upper stretch but proved no match.
DELTA RIDGE, reserved last dropping off the second flight to the backstretch, saved ground racing through the far turn gaining some position, then angled
out three wide in the stretch while finishing willingly to close the gap on the top pair. DEVIL'S MYTH, exchanged light contact at the start, was rated off the
second flight while angling inwards racing to the backstretch, shifted outside rivals racing into the far turn, was fanned four wide nearing upper stretch and
steadily faded. ORIGO shied outwards avoiding tight quarters at the start making some contact with DEVIL'S MYTH, pulled hard against restraint while
shifting out three deep racing to the first turn, moved to lodge a brief bid in that path after a half but quickly emptied out racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
BIG BAD DIVA, caught four wide racing into the first turn racing just off the first flight, continued with a steady effort nearing the second bend to bid for
command in the three path midway through the far turn, struck the front in upper stretch and asserted herself in the closing stages to go clear under firm
right handed encouragement. INEDATEQUILA broke readily, raced on terms with the leaders three deep into the first turn attending the pace, pressed the
issue between foes nearing the second bend to wrest the advantage after five furlongs, dueled inside the winner into upper stretch but proved no match late
while prevailing for the place honors. BABY GUNDIN, caught a bit wide racing into the first turn, shifted inwards to track those rivals from just out of striking
distance on the backstretch, was urged to advance in the four path nearing upper stretch and finished evenly in the closing stages while earning a share.
MIZZEN AIR, urged along the rail racing into the first turn disputing the pace, set the pace on a narrow margin for a half, was headed entering the far turn
and steadily faded into the stretch. HITECH IS BACK ducked out at the start, was caught wide racing the first turn and proved no threat. LA CASTIGLIONE
flashed brief pace between foes disputing the lead into the first turn but emptied out abruptly after a half.

Footnotes
CALL HER JOEY, reserved in the last flight while angling inside leaving the chute, continued unhurried into the backstretch, gathered momentum switching
outside foe racing into the far turn, swung four wide nearing upper stretch while advancing rapidly to challenge for command, took over leaving the furlong
marker and edged clear under steady pressure. MAP EM UP was rated stalking off the first flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, gained some
position while shifting out three wide leaving the midway point of the far turn, bid for command between foes in that path racing into upper stretch but proved
only second best. SUNNYMEDE DREAM was rated just out of striking distance along the inside in the opening half, saved ground on the far turn steadily
drawing into contention on her own courage nearing upper stretch, continued in hand when lacking a path from which to challenge entering the lane, then
angled outside foes leaving the furlong marker to prevail for a share while failing to menace the top pair. PLATINUMCENTS broke readily, sprinted to the
lead while angling to the inside racing through the chute, set the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch, briefly disputed the issue when challenged on
the far turn but gave way racing past midstretch. SIMONELA, urged between foes prompting the pacesetter in the opening half, pressed the issue outside a
rival to gain a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch but gave out abruptly midstretch. BEAUTIFUL TIZ was settled outside the eventual winner in the last
flight racing to the backstretch but offered no rally. ONE FLASHY GIRL was urged to a forward placing three deep prompting the pace racing to the
backstretch but was spent early.

Footnotes
KITTY KITTY was urged to gain the lead racing a bit off the rail after the opening furlong, steadily widened the advantage racing into upper stretch and was
kept to firm right handed pressure. ASPROPODIA settled off the second flight on the backstretch, tipped outside foes nearing upper stretch, split rivals
racing past the sixteenth marker and prevailed for the place honors. BLAZINONBAYOU exchanged light contact with LA BRODY at the start, tracked off the
second flight near the inside racing to the turn, shifted out three wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to gain position between foes while
prevailing for a share. OB LA DI broke readily, switched out three wide nearing the turn while being prompted to pursuit of the pacesetter, continued in that
path to upper stretch but lost momentum when racing erratically in the closing stages. CHILLIN LADY tracked just off the second flight between foes,
worked her way to the rail racing into the turn while being prompted to advance but steadily faded in the drive. LA BRODY exchanged brushes at the start
and dropped out early. THATS JUST HEARSAY angled inwards while making brief pursuit of the eventual winner racing to the turn and gave way between
foes early.

Footnotes
BIONDA SUPRISE raced between foes in second flight in the opening stages, angled inwards to track just off those foes racing into the backstretch, was
prompted to advance inside foes nearing the second bend, tipped out on the far turn, was carried out four wide racing into upper stretch but continued with a
steady late response to wrest the advantage and go clear under firm encouragement. TAMI'S ORCHID, reserved along the inside in the opening half, saved
ground while coming under pressure to advance on the far turn, gained position inside foes entering the lane, then angled out four wide in the closing stages
to prevail for the place honors in time. FAST FASHION was urged to the lead leaving the chute while angling to the rail, set the pace on a narrow margin for
a half, dueled for command inside a rival on the far turn into upper stretch, drifted a bit off the inside late and yielded to the top pair nearing the wire.
STARSHIP SARATOGA, in touch with the pacesetter prompting that rival racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn into upper stretch but
was collared by the leaders late. MORENA DANCER was rated off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four
wide on the far turn, altered course to the inside racing through the lane, then switched out sharply in the closing stages while finishing willingly between
foes to gain position to the end. SPARKLING PLENTY tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out sharply racing three
wide into upper stretch carrying out the eventual winner but faded leaving midstretch. LIZQUEENFLUERDELIS dropped out early. EXAGGERATED
MOMENT angled inwards to track the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. TAP SOLO, caught four
wide, then three deep as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, steadily retreated after a half.
