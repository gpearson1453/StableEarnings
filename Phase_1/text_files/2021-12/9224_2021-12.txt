Footnotes
JACRODRA'S DEVIL settled close in the three and four paths, bid past the three eighths pole and took the lead nearing the five sixteenths, dueled clear at
the quarter and was steadily handled to hold on well. TIMEISGOLDEN broke a step slow and rounded the first turn about the four path, started a bid nearing
the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn, secured second in the upper stretch and finished well. GRAY FASHION settled off the rail on
the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and came along for third late. STACIAS RUBY accelerated to the lead
while angling to the inside and rated the pace, was caught past the three eighths pole, gave chase from that point but dropped back at the rail at the quarter
pole and flattened later yards. ENJOY SUMMER saved early ground then eased outward into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths
pole, ran in the four path of the far turn then flattened. TEN TWENTY ONE saved early ground. UNBRIDLED IRISH saved ground off the pace, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole, showed little response and was eased in the lane. FEAR NOT N BELIEVE was never a factor.

Footnotes
LIL TOUGHMAN settled in the three path the first turn, started a bid leaving the half mile pole and steadily improved to take over the final yards. IN THE
GOSPEL rated close inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch but was caught the final
yards. CROSSTHEBAY rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, dug in to the challenge of In The Gospel leaving the
eighth pole but succumbed to that one mid-stretch. OMEGA GOLD ran in the four path the first turn then settled off the pace into the backstretch, gave
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and raced evenly in the lane. VIDMER'S COURAGE rated off the early
pace about the three path, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn. LET'S GET PHYSICAL saved
ground. MR. SNAP saved ground, picked up the chase into the backstretch but weakened nearing the far turn.

Footnotes
ROLL DEM BONES ducked in at the break and was hustled along to set a pressured pace at mostly even terms, contested the turn two deep, drifted a bit
into the lane but dug in under steady encouragement to take over later yards and raced clear nearing the wire. REMYS GUNSMOKE pressured the pace at
mostly even terms, contested the turn nearest the rail and kept the edge through the upper stretch, though, relented in later yards. THUNDER KITTEN
broke awkwardly then chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path and ran evenly in the lane. TIMMY chased inside, rounded the
turn at the rail and finished evenly. MY PHOENIX gave chase, raced in the three and four paths of the turn and ran evenly in the lane. TWILIGHT YEARS
gave chase outside, raced in the six path of the turn and showed little in the lane. BOUGHT BY DIVA gave chase but faded past the three eighths pole.
CATS DIAMOND BOY broke outward then chased outside and never factored. MANHATTAN WEAVE raced well back. JUBA'S YANKEE ONE was through
early.

Footnotes
MR. HOSTLER took the lead at the three quarter pole then angled in past the five eighths to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths
pole, was headed at the rail past the quarter pole but recovered the edge into the lane and dug in determinedly to eke out the win over the game try of MIO
GRACELAND, who broke in to make contact with Rock File then challenged toward the three eighths pole, dueled to a slim lead two deep past the quarter,
dug in gamely between horses leaving the far turn and was best for second while outfinished for the win. MODERN DAY ROMANCE broke outward to make
contact with Rock File, bid nearing the three eighths pole and contested at a close disadvantage three wide on the far turn, and while game, was
outfinished. WEAVINTHEBLOCKS rounded the opening turn in the four path and raced well off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase toward the three
eighths pole, continued in the four path on the far turn and passed some rivals in the lane. PRINCE JACOB became fractious and unseated his rider in the
gate, rated close to the early pace toward the inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn but flattened the final furlong.
EISELE saved ground, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn but showed little in the lane. ROCK FILE was
jostled at the break and raced well back. LADY SPARROW settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid leaving the half mile pole then weakened at
the rail on the far turn. DEPUTY JAMES showed little response. PROUDLY ELEGANT rated close off the rail on the opening turn, gave chase toward the
seven sixteenths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn.

and dug in to take second the final yards. NAZCA MYSTERY rounded the first turn in the five path, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, ran in the five

mid-stretch and drew away later yards. BOUNDTOBEBAD settled close off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and took the lead three
wide approaching the quarter, ran clear midway on the far turn, was caught inside the sixteenth pole but held on for second. MOONLIT SHADOW settled off
the rail the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced close three wide on the far turn, loomed a factor through the upper stretch and dueled to
take the nod for third at the wire. TAKE CHARGE TINA saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn,
threatened into the lane but flattened inside the sixteenth pole and was nipped from third under the wire. JAMESTOWN ROAD raced well off the pace and
off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, ran in the three and four paths of the far turn and finished evenly. UNCAPTURED RUBY
rounded the opening turn about the three path and showed little response through the backstretch. MISS WAVE rounded the first turn in the four path, raced

and passed rivals. FONDA ROMANA saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, angled to the four path into the
stretch then flattened stride. WALKNTHEPLANK rounded the opening turn about the four path, raced outside leaving the turn and showed little response
through the backstretch. PUT POSITION saved ground off the pace, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, checked in tight at the rail nearing the
quarter pole then weakened. CATHERINES WARRIOR was hustled for the lead early then rated the pace from the three quarter pole, came under pressure
nearing the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail at the quarter pole then gave way leaving the far turn.
