Footnotes
TWO WITH A TEN set the pace along the inside, drifted outwardly in upper stretch as SMART PEGASUS pursued, met that foe's bid in the final furlong, but
held to the wire. SMART PEGASUS stalked along the inside from the two path around the first turn, rated in the pocket into the far turn, tipped outside of the
leader entering the lane, but was herded outwardly by that foe in upper stretch, kept on to bid inside the final furlong, but was denied. CAJUN SHOTS laid
off of the pace two wide, then stayed on in the final furlong to reach show late. STAR'S DREAM pressed the pace from the three to two path around the
turns, but failed to keep pace with the leader and an inner stalking rival turning for home, then lost show approaching the wire. MEG AND CLAIR saved
ground while tracking the pace, but to no avail. PARTY WITH KASSIDY showed little. TWO WITH A TEN DISQUALIFIED, PLACED SIXTH FOR

Footnotes
JUST BLAZE was brushed by an inner foe at the start, trailed the field two wide around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane while committing to a rail
rally, gained inside of foes along with MAY HOUR through upper stretch, bid inside of the leader with that rival passing the furlong pole, dueled to the wire,
and prevailed. MAY HOUR broke outwardly and into an outer foe, got caught in the four path while off of the pace and between horses around the turn, was
outmoved by an inner foe turning for home, tucked two wide entering the lane, rallied outside of JUST BLAZE through upper stretch to bid along with that
foe inside of the leaders passing the furlong grounds, sustained the duel with his inner bidding counterpart through the late stages, but was bested. HIGH
CRUISE stalked the leader from the three path around the turn, got floated to the five path in upper stretch, sustained his grind to bid at the furlong pole led
briefly, but was outfinished by a pair of inner rallying rivals in the late stages. W W KAN DO tracked along the inside, shifted to the three path into the turn,
then to the six path in upper stretch to be outside of the leading trio, but only produced a mild kick, and stayed on to reach a minor reward. PURE VALOR
shifted inside a leading SPECTROLITE early on as that foe drifted outwardly, stalked that rival from the two path around the turn, shifted between horses
entering the lane before being floated to the four path when that rival drifted again in upper stretch, bid and vied between horses into the final furlong, but
flattened out. CHANNEL WON hopped at the start and brushed the inner part of the gate, got hung out in the five path while off of the pace around the turn,
and failed to factor. THE GRAY BLUR was outrun along the inside. SPECTROLITE broke well and was intentionally shifted multiple paths outwards to deter
outer foes from vying for the lead, managed a narrowly clear advantage along the inside around the turn, but drifted to the three path in upper stretch as a
pair of outer foes menaced, then weakened sharply between horses at the furlong pole.

Footnotes
GREY SLOAN trailed behind the fast pace around the first turn, improved between horses down the backstretch, surpassed a pair of outer foes into the far
turn to take aim on the loose leader, swiftly swept past that foe with a quarter mile to go, drew off readily, and was eased up through the closing stages.
CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST rushed the gate when an outer foe broke through it pre-race, raced far off of the pace two wide around the first turn, followed a
rallying GREY SLOAN around the far turn, and stayed on to reach place a sixteenth from home. DOCTRINAIRE cleared early on, opened up down the
backstretch, tired around the far turn, offered little resistance to a bidding rival entering the lane, weakened thereafter, but lost place with a sixteenth to go.
MISTA VALENTINE broke through the gate pre-race, but was quickly reloaded, tracked from midpack along the inside, but faded into the far turn.
UNBRIDLED HOPE stalked along the inside as the clear leader's closest pursuer, but weakened between horses into the far turn. SPEEDY LUIS showed
little. R AND R STAR chased two wide, but was through after a half.

Footnotes
BOURBON IN MAY tracked three wide, ranged up turning for home to bid in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, led at the furlong grounds, and
drew clear. MCFEELY pressed the mild pace two wide, bid turning for home, vied between horses through upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, but
was outkicked at the furlong grounds, and proved second best. MAJESTIC SIGN set a soft pace, clung to an advantage from a pair of outer foes in upper
stretch, but gave way to those rivals the furlong grounds, then held show. DANVILLE saved ground at the rear of the field, then improved between horses in
the final furlong. METROPOL laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted four wide entering the lane, but made little impact. YOUVESAIDITALL stalked along
the inside, but only managed to chase the leading trio through upper stretch before weakening at the sixteenth pole. CALCULATE settled at the rear three
wide, got floated to the five path entering the lane, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
CRUSADER EXPRESS set a clear pace, widened his margin in upper stretch, drifted outwardly at the sixteenth pole while tiring, but lasted to the wire.
COHERE broke a step slowly before being put to a bit of tight quarters at the start, raced far off of the pace two wide improved turning for home, rallied
inside of rivals through the final furlong to attempt a late bid, but ran out of ground. THE THREE KS broke outwardly, stalked outside of the clear leader, but
only managed to chase that foe though upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, then was outkicked by an inner foe for place at the sixteenth pole.
BARREL OF BOURBON tracked along the inside, shifted outside of the leading pair entering the lane, but hung on his left lead, and leveled off. P T'S
FLASH saved ground off of the pace, but faded. RICHARDS DREAM broke a step slowly and was bumped by an inner foe at the start, then got outrun.
BROOK IS GOLDEN came out at the start, chased three wide, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
TAYLOR'S SECRET trailed the field two to three wide around the turn, swung six wide entering the lane, rallied outside of foes with a good kick at the
furlong grounds, drove past KIT KELLER at the sixteenth pole, and cleared. KIT KELLER bumped an inner foe at the start, stalked three wide, ranged up to
bid in upper stretch, led approaching the furlong grounds, but drifted outwardly passing that marker, got headed by an outer rallying rival at the sixteenth
pole, and held place. CYPRESS QUEEN saved ground off of the pace, shifted three wide in midstretch, and rallied between horses late to gain show.
SPLENDA GAIL laid off of the pace two wide, shifted five wide entering the lane, grinded away as her entry-mate rallied alongside, got outkicked by that foe
at the furlong grounds, kept on to bid for show, but was outfinished by an inner foe for that position. RUNNIN HAPPY took bumps from rivals on both sides
at the start, tracked along the inside into the turn, shifted two to four wide entering the lane, but only managed to chase, got outkicked by an outer rival
passing the furlong grounds before shying a bit from a drifting KIT KELLER approaching the final sixteenth, and failed to produce a bid thereafter. MY
DAWN bumped an outer foe at the start, stalked two wide, tucked to the rail entering the lane for clear sailing, but only managed to chase through upper
stretch before fading through the final furlong. BALLERINI sped clear early on, but was headed by a bidding foe at the three sixteenths pole, and
subsequently weakened on his left lead.

SCARLET FUSION thereafter. SCARLET FUSION stalked three wide, was urged along to inch closer around the far turn, ranged up between horses at the
quarter pole, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart in upper stretch, then chased that foe home to prove second best. HOMBRAZO set the pace
along the inside, but gave way to outer foes at the quarter pole, got headed for show in upper stretch, but sustained a battle for that position through the
final furlong as his outer rival hung, and prevailed to regain that minor reward. LIGHTHAWK took the first turn in the two path while in midpack, tracked
intently while inching closer four wide around the far turn, but only managed to chase through upper stretch, flattened out, and hung for show. ANNEAU
D'OR stumbled at the start, laid at the rear of the field in the three path around the first turn, then took the far turn in the four to five paths still with many
lengths to find, and failed to rally. LEROY JENKINS saved ground at the rear, shifted to the three path entering the lane, but made little impact. ONCOMING
TRAIN stalked along the inside, but faded through the lane.

Footnotes
GO SPEED RACER GO lunged outwardly at the start and brushed the gate in the process, tracked the pace from the five path and outside of foes, ranged
up around the far turn, stalled in upper stretch while only managing to chase, but sustained a long drive in the final sixteenth as an outer rival rallied
alongside, and reeled in the leader on the wire. HOT STOVE LEAGUE set the pace in the three path, vied outside of FED MONEY down the backstretch,
led again turning for home before kicking clear in upper stretch, but subtly shifted outwardly in the process, then drifted further out while holding sway
passing the furlong grounds, but tired late, and was nailed on the wire. DREWPOWER trailed along the inside, laid at the rear in the five path around the far
turn before getting floated to the seven path entering the lane, but rallied well through the final furlong while widest, surged late to attempt a bid on the wire,
but missed. RONITHELIMODRIVER settled off of the pace three wide, took the far turn in the four path before shifting to the six path entering the lane, but
only produced a mild kick between horses to reach a minor placing. CRIMINAL DEFENSE settled off of the pace two wide, saved ground around the far turn
before shifting three wide in upper stretch, rallied to split foes at the furlong grounds, attempted a bid inside of the leader passing that marker, but flattened
out. LONG AND STRONG stalked three wide while in the four path, ranged up to the leading pair turning for home, but only managed to chase them
through the lane, and got outkicked by outer foes at the furlong grounds. FED MONEY stalked along the inside around the first turn while in the two path, bid
inside of the leader at the five furlong pole, led into the far turn, but was headed at the five sixteenths pole, then weakened through the final sixteenth.
ANICLUDE tracked the pace from between horses while in the three path, but faded through the lane. BOURRE' TRICK saved ground off of the pace,
moved up to a tracking position into the far turn, but faded through the lane.

LOVE RAN RED stalked along the inside, tipped three wide in upper stretch, bid outside of MACEE at the furlong grounds, and drove clear through the final
sixteenth. MACEE pressed the pace two wide, drove clear passing the three sixteenths pole, but met LOVE RAN RED's bid at the furlong grounds, and was
bested a sixteenth from home. BOSTON MILLIE chased three wide, but was outkicked by an inner foe in upper stretch, then kept on to claim show. LAKE
MARIE set the pace inside of a pressing rival, but got headed by that foe in upper stretch, and weakened. COME ON BIRDIE chased four wide, and tired
turning for home. CAJUN TWO STEP broke slowly and lagged well behind the field, shifted to the five path entering the lane, then passed tired foes.
BEANIE tracked the pace from the two path, but faded through the lane. GREY GREY was outrun along the inside. MARDI GRAS GORMLEY never got
involved.
