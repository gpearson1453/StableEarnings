Footnotes
WAXMAN tracked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, gained under a drive to make a bid in upper stretch, shook clear outside the
sixteenth-pole and proved best under steady urging. SCALDING prompted the pace on the inside, dropped back just off the pace with three furlongs to run,
saved ground around the bend, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole, re-bid between horses in upper stretch, fought with the winner into the final
furlong and was outfinished while able to hold the place. RATIONAL CHOICE settled under some urging, went two to three wide on the turn, was driven four
wide into the stretch, pursued the top two into the final furlong and was out-kicked then missed the place while clear for the show. MANDATORY showed
the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and weakened. ROCK SUGAR broke in at the
start, settled at the rear, shifted from the rail to the three path on the turn and failed to threaten. AMERICAN LAW settled near the back, moved from the two
path to the four path on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
KEPT WAITING settled on the outside, moved closer while three then four wide on the turn, gained to make an outside bid into upper stretch, drifted in while
kicking clear into the final furlong and drew away under a strong drive to prove much the best. SOCIAL WHIRL was well placed just off the pace, came
under some urging in the two path on the turn, made a bid at the quarter-pole, lost touch with the winner into the final furlong and proved no match while just
able to get the place. FETCHING broke a step slow, settled towards the back, went two then three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, was
fanned out around the three-sixteenths and just got up for the show. GET THE CANDY broke very fast, showed the way under pressure to her outside, vied
along the rail on the turn, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and proved no match for the winner then lost the trifecta. SHOW ME THE HONEY
broke a bit awkwardly and was off a half-step slow, raced off the pace under some urging, saved ground on the turn, moved out while asked for her best in
upper stretch and lacked the needed response. GRUDGE pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch
and tired. IRISH CONSTITUTION broke in and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, settled outside at the rear, went three to four wide on the turn
and failed to respond then unseated her rider just past the wire.

drifted in while shaking clear in upper stretch, drew away under a drive into the final sixteenth then was placed under lighter encouragement while much the
best. FROSTY BREW showed good speed from the outside, moved clear late on the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, was challenged near the
five-sixteenths, lost the lead at the quarter-pole, moved out behind the winner around the furlong marker and proved no match while able to get the place.
LANDSLID was hustled from the start, moved out inside the three-quarter pole, gained three wide on the turn, made a bid between horses at the
five-sixteenths, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened but held the show. WATERWORKS showed speed inside of a foe under urging, dropped off
the pace late on the backstretch, chased in the two path on the turn, made a bid between horses at the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and
tired. BOSS LADY KIM broke out and bumped with a foe, went three wide on the turn and was no factor. LUZ broke a step slow, angled out at the rear,
moved in leaving the backstretch, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn and showed little.

Footnotes
SANDRONE went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, controlled the action inside on the turn, responded well when set down into upper
stretch and drew away under strong urging. BUSTIN UP was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and
earned the place while no match for the winner. HE'S GOT IT settled under some urging, raced inside to the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch
under a drive and improved position to get the show. BUILT TO LAST tracked the pace down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, spun
three wide into the stretch and weakened. RED FORTRESS was bumped at the start, settled on the outside without cover, went three to four wide on the
turn, came six wide into the stretch, brushed with a foe into the final furlong and failed to rally. WILD CARP DIEM settled just off the pace, was urged in the
two path on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, brushed with an opponent near the furlong marker, raced between horses late and lacked the needed
response. MY FRIEND DUKE was bumped at the start and forced into another rival, settled just of the pace, went three wide on the turn, was driven four
wide into upper stretch and came up empty. RIPE FOR MISCHIEF broke a step slow, angled in at the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn and was no
factor. DANCING WITH RICO broke a bit slow, raced near the back, saved ground for most of the turn then shifted three wide, came four wide into the
stretch then moved further out and was no factor. SELL SOMETHING broke out and bumped with a foe, went three to four wide on the turn, checked inside
the five-sixteenths, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

two path on the final turn, was asked late on that bend, turned into upper stretch under a drive, fought on well until inside the furlong marker then was
outfinished but secured the show. ALLEY OOP JOHNNY contested the pace on the inside of a foe while along the rail, was asked late on the far turn then
came under a drive into upper stretch, battled into the final furlong and was out-kicked then missed the show. VOLIERO saved ground on the first turn, was
reserved off the pace, went around the far turn in the two path, swung four wide into the stretch and improved position. GIRL DAD tucked into the two path
for the run around the first turn, settled near the middle of the field, was roused while inside on the far turn and lacked the needed kick. FRONT MAN was
