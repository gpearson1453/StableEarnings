Footnotes
BLARNEY GIRL attended the pace along the inside, shifted out between rivals on the second turn, waited briefly in traffic, split foes entering the stretch,
tacked to the inside, forged a narrow lead a furlong out and prove best. AUNT MARY was unhurried into stride, settled along the inside, took closer order
through the second turn, bid between horses entering the stretch, came to level terms nearing the eighth pole, fought on but wasn't quite good enough.
KICK OUT THE JAMS came away a bit slow, was unhurried into stride, made a sweeping move six wide into the stretch, loomed a danger but lacked the
needed late response. MI ENLACE settled into stride, commenced her rally four wide, was within striking distance entering the stretch, but weakened in the
final furlong. ANNA'S MOONLIGHT prompted the pace outside, disputed the issue to the final furlong and faltered. VIETNAM was allowed to settle, ranged
up three wide, got through between rivals entering the stretch, but failed to sustain the drive. MAKING PROGRESS was forwardly placed to the second turn
and retreated. STORMY MATTIE failed to respond. FRONTIER DYNASTY pulled to the fore to dictate terms, contested the pace for six furlongs and
succumbed. TRILOBYTE contended between horses for six furlongs and dropped out. DANCE WITH BODE showed little. Due to a timer malfunction the
seven furlong time was unavailable.

Footnotes
STRUGAR vied for the lead between rivals early, then toward the inside, shook clear entering the stretch and widened. FRANCO'S TEAM settled in hand,
angled out nearing the half mile marker, made a sweeping move four wide through the turn, loomed a danger entering the stretch, but flattened and was all
out to hold the place. AIRWAR prompted the early pace, settled off of the leader on the backstretch, got through entering the lane and continued on willingly.
O CIGANO was slow into stride, advanced between foes on the turn, offered a mild bid entering the stretch, but failed to sustain the drive. GALILEO'S
ROCK was away alertly, pressed the pace outside, but came up empty between runners leaving the turn and faded. COME SEE ABOUT IT was forwardly
placed through the turn and tired. FIRST CRUSADER was close up three deep for a half and dropped out. HATS OFF TOO YOU was allowed to settle three
wide, but stopped before going a half.

Footnotes
THEYKEEPONCOMIN attended the pace along the inside, shifted out and moved up to engage LIVE IT UP on the outside, came to level terms nearing the
quarter pole, poked her head in front a furlong out and was fully extended to narrowly prevail. LIVE IT UP opened clear to set the pace, was collared on the
second turn, relinquished the lead entering the stretch, fought on gamely but grudgingly gave in. MOONLIGHT DANCING steadied from tight quarters into
the first turn, was rank to place and checked near the six furlong marker, made an early move and ranged up along the inside, got through and continued on
well despite the rough go. MALIBU MARLEE was allowed to settle, took closer order on the second turn, fanned out wide entering the stretch, but kept on
willingly through the lane. JOPLIN was unhurried into stride, lagged well back, mounted a late rally circling six wide and was making up ground.
SHOWSTOMPER settled saving ground, shifted out leaving the second turn, but lacked a response when called upon. ITSALLABOUTMEMEME was
allowed to settle four wide and failed to make headway. CHECK SIX was never a factor. AVENIDA MANANA was close up three wide to the second turn
and dropped out.

Footnotes
WAIT FOR NAIROBI tracked in hand along the inside, shifted out to mount her bid, came to level terms leaving the turn, shook clear and widened through
the drive. MY MY MUNNY was allowed to settle three deep, ranged into striking distance through the turn, took dead aim entering the stretch, failed to
menace the winner but kept on well to prove the best of the rest. AMALFI PRINCESS was allowed to settle, moved up four wide through the bend, came
five wide and churned on to earn the minor award. BLOOD CURDLING was allowed to settle, got through to make her bid, but lacked the needed late
response. LEMOS CUNHA was allowed to settle, came five wide and finished with a belated improvement. NATALIES CHARM was unhurried, circled six
wide but passed only the tiring ones. SO GRACIOUS failed to respond. BOLD FIGURE rushed to the lead along the inside to set the pace, was collared on
the turn and gave way readily once headed. JOYA BRILLANTE was forwardly placed three wide for a half and dropped out.

Footnotes
BERATE settled off of the inside, moved up through the second turn, angled out entering the stretch, reeled in the leaders and forged a narrow lead, dug in
and was fully extended to just last. TEMPER MINT TWIST was allowed to settle, moved up between horses, came five wide, angled out further to be clear,
quickened once uncovered and was getting to the winner with every stride. ANGEL CARINA was away alertly, vied three wide, settled off pace, engaged
leader midway through the second turn, gained a narrow lead entering the stretch, but weakened during the drive and settled for the minor award. FORGOT
PASSWORD was allowed to settle, took closer order on the second turn, angled out in the upper stretch and was making up ground. MINT EDITION
tracked three wide, but faltered between rivals entering the stretch and faded. BONKERS was away in good order, disputed the pace along the inside,
opened clear on the backstretch, was collared on the second turn, relinquished the lead entering the lane and faded. PASSO A FRENTE was unhurried
between horses, finished with a belated improvement, but failed to threaten. WICKED INTENT was unhurried, came under a ride into the second turn,
looped up six wide, but came up empty entering the stretch and dropped out. SOUTH GEORGIA was fractious in the gate, broke slow and was never a
factor. TRICK HAT was forwardly placed off of the inside to the second turn and faded. KITTENS CHOICE saved ground to no avail.
CONVENTIONALWISDOM was through after a half.

Footnotes
BIG DREAMING attended the pace along the inside, slipped through on the second turn, took over entering the stretch and widened. SUGOI tracked the
pace outside, bid between runners entering the stretch and churned on to prove second best. HUSH OF A STORM was unhurried into stride, came under a
ride into the second turn, split horses and angled out entering the stretch, loomed a danger but flattened during the drive. NEXT opened clear to dictate
terms just off of the inside, relinquished the lead leaving the second turn and gave way. PEEKACHO was allowed to settle, moved up four wide, was fanned
out further into the stretch and tired. MALTHAEL broke a step slow, settled saving ground, but lacked a response when called upon. DAVID'S GEM settled
three wide, moved up four wide to make a mild bid, but came up empty after six furlongs and dropped out.

HIGHER AUTHORITY was forwardly placed along the inside, tipped out leaving the second turn, split horses entering the stretch and gamely edged clear.
CREATIVE COURAGE pulled to contention four wide, launched a bold bid five wide, came to level terms entering the stretch but weakened slightly in the
drive. TOMAHAWK KITTEN lagged well back, came under a ride with three furlongs to run, looped seven wide into the stretch and was making up ground.
HIGH SPIRITS was unhurried, tucked in to save ground, got through and improved position. TIZ OUR TURN set the pressured pace along the inside,
disputed the issue to the final furlong and gave in. CAN'TBETEMALL settled between foes, took closer order on the second turn, offered a mild bid but failed
to sustain the drive. SUBDUED was allowed to settle, came five wide but failed to make headway. CANDY CANE LANE was caught in tight and checked
hard into the first turn, settled along the inside, ranged into contention and got through but faltered in the final furlong. JAMMERS JUSTICE vied for the lead
outside, was collared between horses and stopped before going six furlongs.

Footnotes
NEVERSAYNOLETSGO tucked in at once to save ground, came under a ride leaving the second turn, angled out and rallied between horses, reeled in the
leader inside the sixteenth pole, forged command, but veered in nearing the wire. TAMI ANN settled in the second flight, mounted a bold bid five wide, took
over entering the stretch, was caught in the final sixteenth, steadied late when the winner ducked in. SMARTY ARTIE was allowed to settle, looped into the
stretch eight wide and was making up ground. PAULAS GAME was allowed to settle, advanced between foes six wide, angled in and continued on willingly.
CRUZIN TATUM was allowed to settle, came four wide, angled to the inside and improved position. OXBOW'S RUBY was unhurried, made a belated gain
between horses but failed to threaten. GUILDER opened clear to set the pace, but faltered entering the stretch and faded. LONGDRINKOFWATER
contended five wide to the second turn and tired. SUPER LUCY showed little in a dull effort. ASIA ASIA was close up between horses for six furlongs and
stopped. ZIGGY'S STORM chased three wide for six furlongs and dropped out. RUN AWAY HIDEN attended the pace along the inside but was through
before going six furlongs and retreated. The jockey of TAMI ANN lodged an objection against the winner for alleged interference near the wire, but following
the review the Stewards made no change to the order of finish.
