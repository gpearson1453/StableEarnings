Footnotes
ASPROPODIA broke readily to gain a forward placing three deep racing to the turn, was eased off the leaders nearing the backstretch to track three deep
behind the second flight, was prompted to make a steady advance in that path through the far turn to upper stretch, responded to left handed pressure to
wrest the advantage nearing the wire and prevailed while her rider took his mount in hand in the final strides. PASS THE SALSA, urged to the lead along the
rail racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to upper stretch, resisted the winner's challenge grudgingly to late stages but couldn't
contain that foe. UPPER SPEED DS, forwardly placed stalking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, shifted inwards under pressure racing into
upper stretch and weakened in late stages while prevailing for a share. MERICATHEBEAUTIFUL, off last, was settled last along the inside racing to the
backstretch, took a few erratic steps while nearest the rail leaving the five furlong marker, switched outside foes approaching the far turn, raced four wide
into upper stretch and continued evenly in the closing stages. MAY BEAU, caught in close quarters inside foes racing to the first turn, tracked the pacesetter
along the rail through the backstretch, tipped out racing into upper stretch but had no closing bid.

Footnotes
LITTLE MISS SASSY broke readily, was righted to gain a forward placing three wide prompting the pacesetter into the turn, pressed the issue through the
bend, took over in upper stretch and forged clear in the last furlong under a hustling ride. LADY IN HEELS, urged between foes to gain the advantage soon
after the break, dictated the pace on a narrow margin between foes into the turn, briefly resisted the winner's bid racing into upper stretch but proved no
match late. BLAZE AWAY N HIDE, urged inside foes prompting the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn, faded in late stages. MISS ARTSY
NOUVEAU was settled last dropping out of close quarters just after the break, angled inside rivals racing into the turn, exchanged several bumps with
WICKED GAL racing through upper stretch but offered no rally. WICKED GAL switched off the inside soon after the start tracking the leaders from out of
striking distance racing to the turn, exchanged bumps in upper stretch and came up empty. IT IS WHAT IT IS ducked out slightly at the start, was settled
outside foes racing to the turn and trailed the field into the stretch.

Footnotes
HELLO ROSIE SAY, off last, was settled into stride trailing the field to the backstretch, switched outside foes on the backstretch commencing a steady
advance four wide racing into the far turn, moved to wrest the advantage leaving the furlong marker and went clear under firm left handed encouragement.
SMOOTH AS GLASS, urged to the lead along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage in the opening half, dueled for command inside a rival
through the far turn to upper stretch, then resisted the winner's bid to late stages but proved only second best. MY BLONDE MARY, forwardly placed
prompting the pacesetter to the backstretch, pressed the issue outside that foe through the far turn into upper stretch but weakened leaving the furlong
marker. CRYSTAL ORB tracked off the first flight three wide racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance in tandem with the eventual winner to
lodge a brief bid three deep between foes nearing upper stretch but soon flattened out. BOURN WILD AGAIN settled into stride off the inside racing to the
backstretch, came under pressure early to advance but offered no rally. JUST LIKE INDY angled to the inside racing into the first turn tracking the leaders
from just out of striking distance but steadily faded after a half.

Footnotes
EAST WING, in touch with the pacesetter between foes in the opening stages attending the pace on her own courage, lost some ground with the leader
racing into upper stretch but responded to strong left handed encouragement to wrest the advantage in time. BAHAMIAN MOON, urged to the lead inside
rivals dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, edged clear racing through upper stretch but faltered in late stages while holding for second. LADY JEAN
ducked out at the start, was settled outside a rival dropping well off the leaders on the backstretch, steadily advanced to contention racing in the four path
through the turn, then angled to the inside racing through the stretch while moving to close the gap on the top pair. CAUGHT UP IN YOU, forwardly placed
four wide racing in touch with the leaders into the turn, continued in pursuit outside the top pair into upper stretch but weakened late. ALL GOOD TIMES
was settled well off the leaders racing through the backstretch into the turn, angled to the four path racing into upper stretch and passed some tiring rivals.
TRUE ATKA, urged along pursuing the leaders on the rail into the turn, gave way racing into upper stretch. MASTERING BELA flashed brief pace three
wide between foes but retreated early.

Footnotes
DANA'S BEAUTY, prompted to contend inside foes in the opening stages, was eased back avoiding close quarters nearing the turn to drop out last, steadily
regained position inside foes saving ground to upper stretch, shifted out splitting rivals to challenge for command in the closing stages and wrested the
advantage in time under firm handling. BRAMBLE BAY was settled last outside a rival on the backstretch, gathered momentum shifting out four wide leaving
the midway point of the turn advancing on the leaders, continued three deep past midstretch challenging for command but was outkicked by the winner.
MOANAS POWER veered outwards at the start momentarily carrying out ABOVE PAR, was righted quickly to dispute the pace between foes on a narrow
advantage racing to the turn, shook clear leaving the midway point of the bend, held sway past midstretch but gave out late when failing to sustain that
momentum. NIGHT CAP vied between foes in early stages, then tracked just off the leaders along the inside racing into the bend, switched out to advance
between foes racing into the lane and continued evenly. SPLASH CASH, urged between foes in pursuif of the leaders to the turn, steadily faded nearing
upper stretch. SILVER TUNES urged inside the pacesetter prompting the pace between foes while angling inwards racing to the turn, gave way into upper
stretch. ABOVE PAR carried out at the start, was quickly righted to make brief pursuit of the pacesetter four wide in early stages but gave way racing into
the lane.

Footnotes
VOLBEAT, urged inside rival's prompting the pace while under light reserve, shifted a bit off the inside racing through the turn while moving to gain the
advantage and edged clear in the two path racing through the stretch while being kept to firm right handed encouragement. SWIFTWISH as urged to force
the pace outside the eventual winner racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue into the turn while being carried to the three path in upper stretch but
proved no match late. REGAL HOLIDAY, forwardly placed three deep between foes tracking just off the leaders racing to the turn, shifted inside racing into
upper stretch but finished evenly late. ANGELUS DIAMOND tracked off the first flight along the inside on the backstretch, tipped out racing into upper
stretch and continued with interest to gain some position. ITS OVER was urged four wide in the opening quarter pursuing the leaders into the turn, shifted
inwards racing into the lane and faded in the drive. GOLDEN SURVIVOR settled well back early and proved no threat. HOOT GIBSON was outpaced in
early stages and never menaced. KICK ROCKS KID, reluctant to load, made brief pursuit of the leaders outside a rival, angled inside nearing the turn and
soon gave way.

Footnotes
BATTLE CHARGE broke readily, pulled a bit while being rated stalking just outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, steadily moved to press the
issue nearing upper stretch, took over racing past midstretch and kicked away late under firm right handed encouragement. HAIL TO was rated outside a
rival tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance, couldn't maintain terms with
the winner racing past midstretch but continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors late. MINING CHROME angled sharply to the inside in the
opening stages to track just off the leaders racing to the backstretch, saved ground into the far turn, came around a tiring foe to bid along the inside leaving
the furlong marker but was outkicked for second. STYLE, held up when caught in tight quarters just after the break, was reserved along the inside to the
backstretch, switched off the inside nearing upper stretch, angled four wide racing through the stretch and continued with an effort to gain some position.
SWEET LAURA broke slowly, was settled last to the backstretch, came under some prompting to advance racing four wide into the lane, was fanned five
wide midstretch and lacked a closing response. READY TO FILM sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the
backstretch, dueled inside the eventual winner through the far turn and gave out leaving midstretch.

Footnotes
DIVINE CONTROL was settled nearest the inside in the opening stages, switched off the rail after the opening quarter while being prompted between foes
in the second flight racing to the turn, angled to the three path racing into upper stretch and produced a stout rally to reel in M V SPEED at the wire under
firm right handed encouragement. The latter broke awkwardly, then exchanged bumps with SEVEN ON SUNDAY at the start, was prompted to advance
between foes, then angled inside the leaders disputing the pace after the opening quarter into the turn, went well clear along the rail racing into upper
stretch but just failed to contain the winner. HEAVEN'S TALE angled to the inside in early stages tracking behind the second flight, was steadied
momentarily avoiding a tiring foe racing into the turn, shifted outside a tiring rival racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to gain a share while
no threat to the top pair. EXCELLENT MARK, in touch with the pacesetter racing in the four path in the opening quarter, pressed the issue three wide racing
into the turn, couldn't match terms with the pacesetter nearing upper stretch, shifted to the inside entering the lane and quickly came up empty. ASSERT
DOMINANCE tracked off the first flight outside foes racing three deep to the turn and steadily faded entering upper stretch. RAMIRIN was settled outside
foes racing four wide on the backstretch and failed to seriously menace. JERICHOS BATTLE switched well off the rail in early stages disputing the pace
inside a rival in the opening quarter, dueled for command between foes racing to the turn and gave way abruptly entering the bend. SEVEN ON SUNDAY
broke inwards bumping M V SPEED, was settled between foes in the last flight and dropped out early.

Footnotes
D'CRAZINESS was rated outside foes dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, advanced three deep entering the far turn, continued with a
steady response gaining four wide on the leaders racing into upper stretch, wrested the advantage nearing the furlong marker and went clear under firm left
handed encouragement. FLY FLY AWAY, urged to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the second
bend, maintained that advantage into upper stretch, proved no match when confronted by the winner but continued well to secure the place honors. EL
PILLO angled inwards racing to the first turn to track just outside the pacesetter in the opening half, was urged to prompt that rival through the far turn into
upper stretch but finished evenly late while prevailing for a share. SKIPPY'S STRIKE settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance four wide through the far turn, was fanned five wide in upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. JIMMY D settled last between foes racing to
the backstretch, switched outside rivals after a half, was caught five wide racing through the far turn, continued six deep into the lane and gained position to
the end. SNAP HOOK tracked the leaders three deep in second flight racing to the backstretch, was roused to advance between foes in that path nearing
upper stretch but emptied out in the drive. STUCK UP, bumped while steadied along the rail leaving the chute, was steadied again in tight quarters racing
into the first turn and never gained contention. THREEOHTWOCASSIE tracked the pace between foes in second flight, was prompted to make some brief
progress between foes, then along the rail racing into the far turn, was shuffled back avoiding tight quarters midstretch and had no late response. MY POINT
EXACTLY, caught in close quarters while shifting inwards bumping STUCK UP racing through the chute, angled to the rail tracking just off the pacesetter
racing to the backstretch and retreated entering the far turn. FU ROO, caught in close quarters between foes racing through the chute, soon dropped out.
