Footnotes
COMMISSIONER G settled inside, advanced after the half, angled out near quarter pole then bid clear under a drive. HARD STING lacked speed, rallied
along the inside to the stretch and closed well for the place. PERFECT REVENGE well placed behind the dueling leaders, bid inside on the final turn and
finished gamely. JUST A THOUGHT set a pressured pace inside then the two path and continued willingly to the finish. RACK GIN broke a bit awkwardly,
chased wide and faltered. LAWLESSNESS trailed for half a mile and was never in contention. GOLDEN SPOKE forced the pace between rivals for half a
mile and stopped. JACOHARE dueled three wide briefly then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
ESPERNSITA raced close up on the rail, waited for room behind horses on the turn, swung four wide at the quarter pole, rallied outside in the stretch run,
dueled with LA REGALADA and wore down that rival to prevail. LA REGALADA vied three wide for the lead, dueled outside on the turn, briefly shook free in
upper stretch, then dug in gamely through the final furlong. WILD DELIGHT raced two wide off the pace, moved up on the turn, came five wide into the lane,
angled in past the eighth pole and rallied inside. SHE'SFIRSTCLASS raced off the rail, off the pace, advanced on the turn, came five wide into the lane and
gained mildly. CALL THE PO PO was outrun early, came three wide into the lane and closed belatedly. BOLD'N NAUGHTY raced off the pace inside and
failed to threaten. NICKYS NOTION was reluctant to load, vied between rivals for command, dueled on the turn and tired. CREATIVE JOY bobbled at the
break, raced off the pace inside, two wide on the turn and did not factor. SEA FRET vied inside for the lead, dueled on the turn and faded.

LIL MISS HOTSHOT vied outside, took over nearing the three eighths pole, drew clear and remained safe driving. CARMELTINI dropped far behind outside,
remained wide and closed well to earn the place. FAIRY WISH stalked the pacesetters outside, went after the winner on the turn and finished willingly.
TAYLOR'S BELLE raced within range early then went evenly through the stretch. PARTY IN THE SAND lagged far behind then closed the gap while no
threat. WEST HORIZEN raced wide throughout and lacked a solid rally. VOLODINA dropped back inside, moved wide on the final turn then faded.
CONGAREE ROSE saved ground off the pace and weakened steadily. SOUTHERN CENTS hustled to the front inside, was finished midway on the final
turn. SPECTACULAR NOW dropped back early and was always outrun. BROAD STORM flashed speed inside then stopped before half a mile.

Footnotes
ANGINETTI stalked close up three wide early, raced two wide on the turn, rallied four wide turning for home, responded when asked and kicked clear under
urging. HIGHTIME VALENTINE broke out bumping a rival at the start, raced four wide off the pace, moved up on the turn, came six wide into the lane,
rallied outside and finished well for second. POSSEINEFFECTTOO tracked on the inside, chased inside on the turn, rallied on the rail in the lane and
earned the show spot. DREAMINOFDASIES chased close up two wide, bid at the quarter pole, dueled into the stretch and weakened. I'AM A UNICORN set
the pace on the inside, dueled passing the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. HOLIDAY RAID raced off the rail, off the pace and closed belatedly
outside. FROSTY FRIEND raced off the pace inside and had no rally. CRICK raced two wide and failed to threaten. INTERVENTION raced four wide early,
three wide on the turn, chased and tired. MON CHERIE raced off the pace inside and did not factor. QUEEN ABARRIO was bumped on both sides at the
start and steadied after, raced five wide early, chased and gave way. STARSHIP BLANCA broke in bumping a rival at the start, raced six wide early, then
four wide and gave way.

Footnotes
SILIPO vied three wide, took over on the turn, led racing greenly, came out brushing foe and held on gamely. JUMP FOR THE WIN moved very wide on
turn and into the stretch, drifted in brushing with winner and was outgamed. RIDICULOUS lacked speed, advanced inside and passed rivals late. CAPTAIN
CHAZZ vied wide early, eased back, steadied when outrun in the stretch. CUNEO dueled between rivals then began fading on the turn. YO
NESSROUNDONKERN lacked speed outside and was never in contention. TURNPIKE BOB earned a narrow lead inside then proved empty in the stretch.
TEQUILA JR was fractious in the gate prior to start then gave way readily wide. The stewards posted an inquiry into the stretch run with no change in order
of finish. A claim of foul by the runner-up against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed. A claim of foul by the fourth finisher against the
second finisher for interference in the stretch was also denied.

Footnotes
DANCE CODE set pressured pace inside, vied to final yards, edged clear, held on gamely then drifted out late under left handed whip. SPEAKING
prompted the winner throughout, dueled to midstretch, could not get by and steadied late behind that rival late. SCRIPT advanced inside and made a
gradual gain in the stretch. SOUTHERN RUNNER lacked speed, raced wide throughout and continued well while no threat. VINE JET chased outside well
off the pace and lacked a solid rally. PRACTICAL COACH pressed the dueling leaders outside, faded on the turn and lost position late. EGOT A POKER
FACE stumbled badly just after the start losing any chance. RAGING TEMPEST saved ground and gave way readily. A claim of foul by the runner-up
against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.
