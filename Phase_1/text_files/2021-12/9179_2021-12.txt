around the first turn on the outside, finished wide and was no factor. DAIGLE dueled on the front end, saved ground and faded. LIL HOT TODDY raced

match for the top two. MISTAKE PRESENT raced in the back of the pack, showed late interest, but was no factor. CORVETTE SPIRIT pressed the pace,

Footnotes
COMBAT COMMAND unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the inside around the second turn, angled out entering the stretch, rallied and proved the
best late. FRIENDOFTHECOURT vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, but couldn't hold off the winner late for the win. HOT LE ROY lacked
early speed, gained ground late, proved no match for the top two, but got up for third. FLASH ME BACK raced within striking distance, came around the
second turn wide and was outfinished for third. MEAN CRUISER lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. UNBELIEVABLE CATCH
raced near the back in the early part, moved up to the middle of the field and finished evenly. G DON'T KNOW dueled on the front end and was finished
early. CALLTHEWOLFE always raced near the back and showed little. HOLY SUNRISE raced in the middle of the pack, came around the first turn on the
outside and retreated. HOT APRIORITY raced within striking distance, had an outside trip and dropped back.
