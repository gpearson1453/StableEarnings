Footnotes
GOLD SPECIAL, bumped at the start, was settled into stride racing past the chute, gained some position between foes nearing the turn, shifted out three
wide midway through the bend advancing on the leaders, wrested the advantage leaving midstretch and went well clear under firm encouragement.
VOLBEAT, urged prompting a rival's pace racing through the backstretch, edged forward to lead between calls racing into upper stretch but proved no
match when confronted by the winner. TACTICAL RANGE tracked off the first flight four wide racing through the backstretch, then continued in that path to
the lane with an even effort while gaining a share. HERECOMESTHEHAMMER broke outwards bumping the eventual winner soundly at the start, was
quickly righted, then urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin racing into the turn, was headed nearing the lane and gave way
midstretch. FALL CAMPAIGN settled last along the inside racing through the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. LAYNES KNIGHT tracked off the
first flight three wide between foes racing to the turn but faded early.

Footnotes
MIZZEN AIR, urged to a forward placing along the inside racing to the first turn, conceded the lead, then switched outside the pacesetter racing into the
backstretch, continued with a steady bid pressing that rival on the far turn and edged forward in late stages under firm right handed pressure. DR. ANN was
urged to the lead outside the eventual winner racing into the first turn, shifted to the inside once clear approaching the backstretch, set the pace on a narrow
margin for a half, then dueled inside the winner in a grudging effort to late stages while just failing to contain that foe. HUSH Y'ALL tracked off the first flight
along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and continued evenly in late stages. DEPUTY DORA settled along the inside in
early stages, switched out racing to the backstretch, angled three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a belated effort to improve position.
HELLO ROSIE SAY settled outside foes dropping out last racing to the backstretch, came under prompting to advance racing into the far turn, was fanned
four wide in upper stretch but had no closing bid. SPIN CLASS tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch and steadily faded between
foes leaving the far turn. GLOVANNA worked her way to the inside early tracking off the second flight but retreated after a half.

Footnotes
QUICK CONVERSATION stalked just off the leaders along the inside racing through the backstretch, tipped out entering the turn commencing a steady
advance, shifted to the three path in upper stretch gaining terms with MORNING COCKTAIL and edged forward of that foe in the closing stages under firm
right handed encouragement. The latter, in touch prompting the pacesetter racing through the backstretch, took over from that foe midway through the turn,
resisted the winner's challenge leaving midstretch but proved only second best. AWILDAS TREASURE settled into stride in the opening stages, was
prompted to advance four wide entering the turn, shifted inwards racing into upper stretch splitting rivals and produced her best stride in the closing stages
to prevail for a share. LOOKING FOR LOVE, urged along the rail dictating the pace on a narrow margin racing to the turn, was headed midway through the
bend and gave way in the drive. PRETTY DEVIL swerved a bit at the start, tracked the leaders between foes racing into the bend but had no closing bid.
INERTIA was rated off the second flight in the opening stages, swung out four wide racing into the turn while making brief progress, but flattened out in
upper stretch. SENA THE DUCHESS tracked the leaders three between foes racing to the turn but faded early. MISSY TOO ducked out at the start while
being slow to gather stride and proved no threat. HELLO PRINCESS tracked the leaders leaders along the rail as part of the second flight racing through the
backstretch but retreated early.

Footnotes
TIZ TRIUMPHANT, in touch with a rival attending the pace under light rating racing to the backstretch, met a rival's challenge after a half to dispute the
issue racing into the far turn, was urged clear on the second bend and steadily widened his advantage under firm right handed encouragement. JACK
RABBIT QUICK, reluctant to load, broke sharply to gain a forward placing three deep tracking just off the leaders, tipped out four wide entering the far turn
while being prompted to advance, continued in pursuit of the winner through the stretch but proved only second best. SUPER SHOES tracked off the first
flight inside foes racing to the backstretch, shifted off the inside to gain position between foes racing through the far turn, then shifted out sharply racing into
upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for a share. GIOVANE'S PROMISE settled off the second flight a bit off the inside racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide racing through the far turn and continued in that path late while making an effort to improve position. RAL
COPPERHEADROAD, off slowly, was caught four wide racing into the first turn while being prompted to contend, commenced an early move in that path
entering the backstretch to gain a brief advantage after a half but flattened out racing through the far turn. COMMANDER KEITH tracked off the first flight
between foes in the opening half, continued three deep between foes on the far turn, was forced to alter course avoiding SUPER SHOES racing into upper
stretch shifting inside that foe and faded in the closing stages. AND THE OSCAR GOES broke inwards brushing the gate while making light contact with
GIOVANE'S PROMISE, was going a bit erratically in early stages and proved no threat. TUDOX IMAGINEER, urged along the inside disputing the pace in
the opening half, continued in pursuit of the leader into the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. BUSTER, restless in the gate, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
I'M BUZZY, reserved while angling sharply to the rail racing through the chute, continued under rating along the inside to the backstretch, switched out after
a half, then was prompted to advance with a sharp move racing four wide through the far turn, rallied to the front midstretch and went clear under firm
handling. GOLD WATCH, bumped at the start, was settled outside foes racing three deep off the second flight to the backstretch, continued in that path
gaining some position between foes racing into the far turn, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch but continued willingly to prove best of the
others. SIGN AND SEAL, reserved along the inside behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, was hemmed along the rail awaiting an opening
entering the far turn, switched out to split foes three deep nearing upper stretch, appeared to clip heels when losing her path to BABY LUCK nearing
midstretch, but altered course to race in the seven path in the final stages while finishing with interest to prevail for a share. TIZ NENA settled between foes
racing behind the second flight to the backstretch, switched out racing into the far turn to circled foes five wide, angled inside racing into upper stretch and
lacked the needed final kick. BABY LUCK ducked inwards bumping TEA'S DREAM, then shied outwards bumping GOLD WATCH at the start, was urged
between foes to gain terms prompting the pace racing to the backstretch, continued in a protracted skirmish to upper stretch while drifting out, shifted
inwards sharply crossing a rival's path midstretch and continued well enough to finish on even terms with a rival at the wire. BIG TENTATIONS, urged to the
lead along the inside disputing the pace racing to the first turn, dueled for command into upper stretch but gave out once headed by the winner. AMAZING
MSKITTY settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and passed only tiring rivals. BUFFALO DANCER tracked off the first flight three wide racing to the
backstretch and faded early. TEA'S DREAM, bumped at the start, recovered to track the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the far turn and
gave way racing into the lane. ANAHIYA'S DREAM tracked the leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight in early stages but steadily retreated racing
into the far turn. ROUGH ENOUGH, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the dueling leaders, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
NICK THE CARDSHARK, in touch with the leaders nearest the inside attending the pace on the backstretch, continued under patient handling conceding
some position racing into the turn, tipped out racing into upper stretch to split foes three deep challenging for command, wrested the advantage late and
edged forward under firm right handed encouragement. UNION GAP threw his head at the start getting away slowly, was settled outside foes racing to the
turn, steadily gathered momentum while being fanned six wide racing through the stretch but produced his best stride in the closing stages to gain terms
with the winner while edging a rival for the place honors. OLD TIMER'S DAY, urged between foes prompting the pace through the backstretch, was eased
back avoiding tight quarters racing into the bend, switched out on the turn while being urged to bid between foes nearing upper stretch, struck the front
racing into the lane but couldn't fend off the top pair late. HIGHLAND PARK HERO bobbled at the start, was righted to track off the first flight along the
inside, shifted out four wide racing through the turn to lodge a bid but flattened out in the drive. WILD WINTER, off slowly, was settled inside foes racing to
the turn, angled out four wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to gain some position between foes while racing in close quarters. FIREHORN
broke readily, was held up off the leaders while switching well off the inside racing through the backstretch, was prompted to make some brief progress five
wide nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid. PAPA LUKE joined the pace four wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards nearing the turn
dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, dueled between foes into upper stretch and gave way. MIGHTY GHOST settled into stride shifting off the inside
racing through the backstretch but failed to menace thereafter. RED HOT LOOKS, urged three wide between foes prompting the pace in the opening
stages, angled to the rail disputing the issue inside a rival racing into the turn and gave way after a half.

Footnotes
WICKED GROOVE was rated outside rivals racing three deep just off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance racing four wide
through the far turn to upper stretch and produced a solid closing response to gain the advantage and go clear under firm handling. JEAN V'S LEGACY
tracked the leaders three deep in second flight in the opening half, was prompted to advance between foes in that path nearing the lane, couldn't match the
winner's kick but edged rivals for the place honors. LADY DOMINANCE, reserved avoiding close quarters in the opening stages, continued under light rating
inside foes to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, then swung out four wide racing through the stretch finishing willingly to close the gap on
the top pair while gaining a share. WORLD TOUR, urged to the lead between foes, shifted to the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing to
the backstretch, maintained the advantage to upper stretch but gave out in late stages. BEAN COUNTER was rated off the second flight inside foes in the
opening half, saved ground gaining position inside foes racing into upper stretch, shifted outside a tiring rival in late stages but lacked the needed final kick.
C'EST MARDI, forwardly placed outside rivals tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, shifted in to lodge a brief bid between foes racing through
the far turn but came up empty in the drive. CAIRA, reserved while angling inside racing to the backstretch, swung out to race seven wide in upper stretch
making some contact with BABY GUNDIN but continued with interest to gain position to the end. NO ORDINARY TIME tracked off the second flight three
deep between foes to the backstretch, was fanned five wide into the lane but lacked the needed late bid. BABY GUNDIN settled outside foes racing to the
backstretch, was fanned eight wide into upper stretch while being bumped by CAIRA and had no final kick. TETELLA tracked off the first flight between foes
in the opening half, shifted out three deep racing into the far turn and steadily faded. AMORTIZATION (IRE) settled last along the inside to the backstretch,
switched out nearing the lane, was fanned nine wide in upper stretch but proved no threat. KISSMELIPS, forwardly placed stalking just off the pacesetter
racing to the backstretch, gave way entering the far turn.

Footnotes
AWESOME ANYWHERE, urged between foes racing past the gap disputing the pace, dueled for command inside a rival racing into the turn a bit off the
inside, pressed the issue into upper stretch and edged forward late under brisk handling. BRING ME A CHECK joined the pace three deep in the opening
stages, pressed the issue outside the eventual winner into the stretch but proved only second best. GRAN RUNNER tracked the leaders five wide in second
flight racing through the backstretch, came under pressure nearing the turn to advance four wide between foes to the lane and continued with a mild bid to
gain a share. HIDE THE DEMON, unhurried six wide racing through the backstretch, was prompted to advance racing five wide through the turn and
continued in that path to gain position to the end. MY BOY LENNY, in touch with the leaders four wide stalking the pace, continued in pursuit of the top pair
three deep into the lane but faded late. NATIVE HAWK was rated tracking off the first flight between foes racing into the turn but lacked the needed closing
response. HE'S SMOKIN NOW settled into stride along the inside early and never gained contention. IMPERIAL KING, reserved in the opening quarter, was
prompted to make some brief progress between foes nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. LITIGANT, urged inside foes on the backstretch prompting
the pace, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
MUSETTA, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling while tipping out on the far turn awaiting an opening, split
foes three deep nearing midstretch, then shifted out surging outside the leaders to gain even terms with a rival at the wire under firm handling. LULLABY
LAND was prompted through close quarters leaving the chute to gain a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, was urged
to bid for command between foes nearing the second bend, dueled for command inside a rival through the far turn to the wire in a protracted skirmish and
narrowly edged that foe to share the win. MAP THE MOMENT, bumped soundly at the start while forced into SIDNEY SUE, was righted, then urged to gain
terms with the leaders while caught four wide racing to the first turn, was prompted to advance three deep after a half to challenge for command racing into
the far turn, disputed the issue in a prolonged skirmish to the end but was just outfinished by the top pair. SIDNEY SUE, bumped soundly then forced into
FARCICAL while squeezed between foes at the start, settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three wide on the far turn,
was fanned four wide midstretch and lacked the needed final response. FARCICAL, restless in the gate, was bumped soundly while forced in at the start,
settled last racing to the far turn, shifted off the inside racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to gain position between foes late. DR KAAK
tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the far turn and steadily faded into the stretch. THEUNCAPTUREDLADY was rated along the inside tracking
off the first flight in the opening half, was prompted to advance in close quarters near the inside on the far turn but gave way nearing the lane.
FLOWERSFORSHANTELL settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. V K STAR, urged to the lead along the
inside, set the pace for a half and gave way racing into the far turn. BLAZINONBAYOU veered inwards at the start, colliding with MAP THE MOMENT
forcing that rival into the path of SIDNEY SUE and FARCICAL, was righted to track off the second flight outside foes but retreated early.
