Footnotes
TRADING BAY bumped with AMERICAN TAP at the start, showed brief speed then pressed the pace, was clear briefly but closed and bid late turn, led
upper stretch and held sway under a drive. SWIRLING DANCER forced then stalked the pace, chased angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn, lugged
in at the head of the stretch then straightened away and rallied gamely. BLAZING SKY, bumped by ERASMO'S GIRL in the early going, settled off the pace,
was hustled from the rail on the turn then finished gamely. GAMBLE'S SILVER settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then rallied
mildly. KHOZZY VALINTINE broke inward and bumped TRADING SKY, set a pressured pace, was headed upper stretch and chased but was losing
positions. ERASMO'S GIRL, bumped early, settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn then rallied belatedly. FEDALIA settled off the pace,
chased three-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and chased from the outside. AMERICAN TAP, bumped at the break, settled in mid pack,
chased two to four-wide on the turn but evened out in the late stages.

reserved pace, quickened on the far turn, drifted out leaving the turn, lost the lead and chased through the stretch. SNOW SQUALL pressed the pace,
forced the issue on the far turn, chased hard and finished gamely. NORTHERN CROSS broke inward, mid pack, chased three-wide on the far turn, cut to
the rail in the stretch and finished gamely. SHUDDACUDDAWUDDA settled off the pace, closed five-wide five-wide on the far turn then evened out in the
stretch. ELEANOR POWELL stalked the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn but never reached contention. SHE'S A TRUE FOX settled
off the pace, was steadied on the backstretch, closed along the rail on the far turn but finished evenly. CANADIAN ESSENCE, in mid pack early, chased
from the rail to three-wide on the far turn then posted a mild late run through the stretch. ELUSIVE SOCIETY was off slowly, settled in range, was hustled
four and five-wide on the far turn then her rally stalled in the stretch. MUSKOKA LADY was away slowly, settled off the pace, closed five-wide on the turn
and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
FORESTERS PRINCESS dueled outside a rival on the first turn and down the backside, opened a clear advantage into the far turn and was open lengths in
front, but began to shorten strides in the final sixteenth and needed the wire, just able to hold on. MIZZ GEMMA chased along the inside, was alone behind
the two pacesetters on the backside, took up the chase when the winner sprinted away from her pace pal, closed in down the lane but ran out of real estate,
just failing to get by. COURTINGCOURTNEY trailed inside, rallied two wide on the far turn, in the three path in upper stretch before dipping to the rail at the
sixteenth pole, coming on best of all late with a solid run. OPAL CREEK threw her head at the start and was grabbed up by the rider, rallied rail to two wide
into third at the quarter pole with momentum but her run stalled in the final sixteenth and she was passed for the show spot late. IVICTORY chased outside
on the first turn, seemed to drop back three wide on the far turn but regrouped and put in a mild rally outside down the stretch to best the balance. LEMON
DROP FOX sat along the rail in midpack, was roused two wide on the far turn and out in the three path in upper stretch, levelling off in the final stages while
failing to change to her proper lead. POSITIVE sat in midpack two wide early, dropped back on the far turn and put in a mild re-rally down the lane from the
back. MISS NAHA TE three to two wide on the first turn and off the pace, was only able to pass one straggler down the stretch. BODY OF LAW was inside
pressing the winner around the first turn and down the backside, began to back up into the far turn and didn't recover.

Footnotes
ABITIBI off the pace early, circled the field three to five wide and out in the eight path turning for home, drifted in through the lane when passing them all, led
at the seventy yard pole and pulled away. TRIZZEL TRAZZEL was pinched back soon after the start, got through along the rail on the turn to be in behind
the leaders, tipped out to the three path turning for home and ducked in when bidding for the front at the eighth pole, opened up but was caught by the
winner at the seventy yard marker, a clear second best. PROUD SPEAKER sat in midpack, four wide through the turn and followed the winner into the
stretch in the eight path, lay in down the lane and outkicked by the top pair but a clear solid close for third. DRAMATIC FASHION broke in the air at the start
and was off the pace, was maneuvered into a nice rail run on the turn and came off the fence in midstretch to get around a tiring rival, closed very well in the
final stages to best the rest. FREDERICIA was very slow to begin, trailed two to four wide on the turn and out in the seven path into the stretch, closing with
strong powerful strides late while still outside. I HAVE AN IDEA chased along the rail, tipped out at the quarter pole and drifted out to bump a rival turning for
home, levelling off in the final furlong. SHE MAKES ME TIZZY hesitated at the start, rushed up to be in behind the leaders along the rail, tipped out to the
three path to bid turning for home when bumped off stride, running evenly down the lane after that incident. BABY FADE led along the rail and shook off a
challenger to get clear turning for home but was headed at the eighth pole and retreated. MENAGERIE sat in midpack and in the two path throughout,
rallied into traffic in midstretch and seemed discouraged, eased in the final sixteenth by the rider. TARA LUNA broke out at the start, settled in midpack and
three to four wide on the turn, inside the eventual winner at the quarter pole but could not sustain a bid down the lane. JAIMIE'S WARRIOR press the early
leader throughout and had a brief advantage oin the turn but retreated down the lane. WELL ACTUALLY chased early, backed up two to three wide on the
turn and never recovered. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY ON THE TURN REGARDING I HAVE AN IDEA DRIFTING OUT AND INTERFERING
WITH SHE MAKES ME TIZZY. AFTER REVIEW I HAVE AN IDEA WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SIXTH TO SEVENTH.

the turn but never reached contention. DROP A CARIBOU, bumped at the break, set a pressured pace, dueled on the turn, gave way at the top of the
stretch and evened out. J M R BEST OF TURF settled off the pace, was hustled three to five-wide on the turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
MS VANCOUGAR chased early, up to stalk two to three wide on the turn and loom in the four path at the quarter pole, sprinted clear when let loose turning
for home and widened while ridden out. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD trailed early, was steadied along the rail into the turn, tipped out and circled the field four
wide at the quarter pole and out in the eight path turning for home, down the center of the track to grab the place spot late over two rivals. COOL SOCIETY
off the pace, came into the three path in upper stretch and shifted out to get a seam inside the eighth pole, was closing inside the place finisher and doing
best of all in the final forty yards. GLORIANNIA broke awkwardly and off the pace, rode the rail on the turn and angled out to the three path in the stretch,
closed well but was outfinished by the second and third place runners to her outside. HARD STREET chased inside, got a nice run up the inside but was
outkicked by three rivals for minor placings in the final furlong, her punch not as strong. HIT AND RUN sat along the rail in midpack, angled out between
foes at the quarter pole, was in range for a placing at the eighth pole but stalled in the late stages. ROAD TO ROMANCE tucked in behind the leaders until
the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch but drifted as much as going forward in the final furlong. GOLDEN GARTER sat in midpack, moved up into
range three to five wide on the turn and out in the six path turning for home, only able to mildly close down the lane. HALFINTHEWRAPPER pressed the
front early, bid late on the turn but was repelled and retreated down the stretch. FOREST DRIFT led early, repelled a challenger late on the turn but was
passed by the winner at the top of the stretch and faded in the final furlong. FAIRYWREN settled in midpack, was hustled two to three wide on the turn but
backed up down the stretch. HAI BOBBI four wide stalking early, loomed three to four wide on the turn while outside the eventual winner at the quarter pole
but had no punch left for the stretch. FIVE DAYS IN MAY off the pace and three to five wide near the rear on the turn, was beside the eventual place finisher
for a while but had nothing left for the stretch. TAKE IT EASY was three wide in midpack early, threw up the white flag midway on the turn and backed
through the field.

Footnotes
SIR WINSTON sat off the rivals who traded the front end amongst themselves for the first mile, moved in tandem with his stablemate for the lead at the
three eighths pole, battled with that one all the way to the wire, inching away in the final forty yards. FROSTED OVER stalked and chased the leaders,
moved inside the winner to gain command at the three eighths pole, gave way grudgingly to that one in the final forty yards. COLLECTIVE FORCE dueled in
the first turn while under a hold, let a headstrong rival go under the wire for the first time, moved up with the top pair to third into the far turn and while no
match for that pair, did hold the show spot down the lane. BURNING MAN trailed into the final turn, closed with good energy to make it close for the third
spot and outkick a few rivals to his outside. WIN D'ORO was in midpack along the rail and in behind runners, on hold for basically the first six furlongs,
closed down the stretch between runners to get in the mix late for a minor placing. ENGLISH CONQUEROR off the pace, moved three wide on the final turn
and out in the five path turning for home, in position for a minor placing but outfinished by rivals in the final seventy yards. WAR BOMBER (IRE) was
headstrong and out in the four path under the wire for the first time when zooming off to the lead maybe not realizing he head to go around again, collared at
the three eighths by the top two finishers and faded down the stretch along the rail. SIR SAHIB in midpack along the rail, circled three to four wide on the
last turn, tipped out to the six path turning for home and stalled widest at the eighth pole. SHANGASSAH off the pace on the inside, was steadied to avoid a
pulling up rival under the wire for the first time, stayed inside throughout and closed mildly into the stretch to be in position but could not sustain his bid.
SPECIAL FORCES settled in midpack, was three wide on the second turn and four wide on the last turn, widest in the stretch when his rally came to an end
at the eighth pole. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE off the pace and three to four wide on the final two turns, dropped back midway on the last turn and did not
threaten in the stretch. PEACE SEEKER was wide at the back early, circled past a few three to five wide on the last turn but could not get into contention.
THEREGOESJOJO off the pace and two to four wide on the turns, no rally forthcoming. JELGO led before chasing along the inside, was pulled up under
the wire for the first time and vanned off.

Footnotes
MAXIMUS MOMENTUS trailed early, advanced between runners two to four wide on the turn, in behind and in traffic at the eighth pole, tipped out to get
clear and was up in time in the shadow of the wire. NASHTRICK was off the pace, on hold in tight between on the turn, split rivals in the stretch and had the
front late but was caught nearing the wire. PRICELESS WILL chased outside, was behind the leaders before tipping out to loom entering the stretch, had a
brief lead inside the eighth pole but was outfinished by the top pair. MASTER SPY sat in midpack outside, circled three to four wide on the turn and out in
the six path turning for home before being outkicked late. COMMANDER TOM led quickly, was hounded by a pace buddy throughout, put that one away but
was headed at the eighth pole and faded in the final sixteenth. ARGENTIUM off the pace, had one beat on the turn and put in a mild rally down the stretch
without threatening. GIANT CRITIC was back to trail after a sixteenth, only able to pass a few stragglers down the stretch. SOUL FREEDOM press the front,
traded the lead with his pace pal on turn but was empty for the stretch drive. U S ARMY CORPS chased along the inside, was still behind the leaders on the
turn but backed up in the stretch.
