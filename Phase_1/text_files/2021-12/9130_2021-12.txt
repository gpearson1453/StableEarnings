Footnotes
COLOMBARD broke alertly and crossed over to the inside, set a pressured pace over RICHIESONARAMPAGE and held slim lead around the turn, coaxed
two wide entering the stretch run, responded gamely under pressure, widened to a clear advantage and finished going away. YOUNG CORBETT raced
inside a foe off the top flight heading into the turn, launched an inside bid turning for home, was no match for pulling away winner but stayed on with
response and held second best. COOL AMBITION was unhurried and raced off the top two flights, swung out leaving the turn, launched a five wide bid in
the lane, rallied and captured a share. PRESIDENT ELECT sat outside a rival and tracked the top flight heading into the turn, hustled along three wide
heading into the lane, remained in pursuit past the furlong marker then evened out in late stages and got edged out for runner up spots.
RICHIESONARAMPAGE applied pace pressure to the winner through early stages, remained in striking distance through the turn, lost the whip in the upper
stretch and steadily faded. WATER PATROL trailed four wide through early stages, saved ground through the turn and had no response.

through the turn, battled back between rivals to the furlong marker then gave way. WAY TOO SMARTE got bumped at the start, rated off the pace,
continued in the last flight around the turn then raced wide into the lane and had a mild improve. DARING DAMSEL raced inside in the last flight, swung out
turning for home, raced four wide in the upper stretch and lacked the needed response for late impact. VEGAN GOES BEST steadied briefly in opening
stages, steadied inside around the turn, shifted out in the lane and failed to rally. KIANA'S LOVE chased four wide through the turn then faded in the lane.

Footnotes
STORMINSIDE sped to the lead out of the gate, held a slim lead over SHMILY around the turn, saved ground turning for home, shook the reins in the upper
stretch, responded, widened to a clear advantage and held firm while ridden out. SHMILY was away in good order and moved in closer from the outside
position, raced in striking distance through the turn, was set down three wide for the drive, remained game in pursuit but had to settle for second best.
GONZO raced in the back although never too far from the frontend, launched a five wide bid into stretch run, steadily edged up closer and gained show.
TRY TRY AGAIN chased in range along the rail through the turn, ran on two wide past the eighth pole then evened out and lost show. MIAS MOONBEAM
was not far back, chased two wide through the turn, came out a path wider for the drive and had no closing response. FINNEGAN (IRE) raced in contention
around the turn then faded in the lane.

Footnotes
ROAR OF THE LION was unhurried and saved ground around the first turn, remained reserved along the rail through the backstretch, picked up the pace
four wide around the far turn, responded under a drive in the upper stretch, cleared past the eighth pole and pulled away. WILD FOX vied for the lead
around the first turn, set the pace along the rail through the backstretch and held clear around the far turn, continued on top with a slim lead to the furlong
marker then failed to be a match for the winner. COCKALORUM settled off the early pace, raced three wide through the far turn, bid four wide in the upper
stretch, angled in a couple paths under pressure and prevailed for a share. DRAMATIC KITTEN vied for the lead around the first turn, remained forwardly
placed inside through the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, launched a rail bid heading into the lane, raced in close contention at the furlong
marker then gave way. MANGO TREE was unhurried through early stages, saved ground through the far turn, tipped out a path wider for the drive and
improved position without threatening. JIMMIE T tracked the pace through the backstretch, made a three wide bid around the far turn, moved into contention
then weakened past the furlong marker. MAJESTIC JOHN'S rated inside off the early pace,, shifted out late on the far turn and failed to move on. RAHFEE
TOWN stumbled at the start, quickly recovered and prompted the pace, then came up empty mid-way through the far turn.

Footnotes
KHOZAN'S VALENTINE dueled inside of SUSPECT around the first turn, battled on while clear over the next pursuer through the backstretch, shook free
late on the far turn, held a clear advantage at the eighth pole then held late over gaining RIVER CACTUS. RIVER CACTUS raced in the back around the
first turn and remained unhurried through the backstretch, launched a two wide bid at the head of the lane, took closer order, came out wider, finished
gamely and ran out of time. COWBOYS DREAM rated inside off the early pace, saved ground around the far turn, launched a rail bid into the lane and
stayed on for a share. COLONEL KLINK tracked the embattled pair through the backstretch, coaxed two wide around the far turn, came out wider in upper
stretch then angled back in two wide and lacked closing response. W W CRAZY raced off the early pace, urged three wide around the far turn, stayed under
pressure into the lane but failed to kick on. DYNABLUE rated near midpack, urged three to four wide through the far turn then weakened in the lane.
SUSPECT dueled outside of KHOZANE'S VALENTINE around the first turn, battled on while clear over the next pursuer through the backstretch, could not
remain on equal terms past the midway point on the far turn and steadily weakened.

rail bid at the head of the lane, bumped with weakening FULL MAGAZINE in the upper stretch, battled on gamely inside of IWILLPERSEVERE and got a

lead around the first turn, showed the way through the backstretch and held firm around the far turn, fought back briefly in the upper stretch then bumped

ISABELLACANNETELLA vied for the early lead with LILY'S WOOFY, then shook free entering the turn, roused three to four wide entering the lane, widened
advantage under steady pressure and remained clear. GHAALEB THE GREAT settled through early stages and remained reserved entering the turn,
shifted out five wide at the head of the lane, rallied along the outside and gained second best. STOPSHOPPINGAMY was ridden along in range through
early stages, saved ground around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive and churned on for a share. LILY'S WOOFY vied inside of eventual winner through
early stages, remained forwardly placed around the turn, came again in the upper stretch then gave way in the final furlong. MANHATTAN LEGACY angled
off the inside in opening stages, chased three wide around the turn then gave way. SUMMER DAY raced widest through early stages, stayed outside into

Footnotes
QUILTING PARTY was fractious loading, unseated the rider, briefly ran loose, quickly apprehended and reloaded, chased the top pair three wide around the
turn, came out wider for the drive, swept by the embattled pair in the final furlong and finished going away. DANCING BARBIE got bumped at the start but
still managed to grab the early lead, vied inside of MISSEN THE POINT around the turn, battled on into the lane then failed to be a match when the winner
kicked by. MISSEN THE POINT got bumped at the start, moved up and vied outside of DANCING BARBIE for the lead into the turn, battled back past the
furlong marker, was no match when the winner took over but stayed on and cleared the rest. PEYOTE PEGGY chased four wide around the turn, floated out
wide entering the lane and had a mild improve. HELLO HERO got bumped back at the start and lost ground, raced in the last flight then four wide into the
upper stretch and never threatened. GOSHEN GIRL steadied shortly after the start and failed to move into close contention. RENDLAKE chased the early
pace, saved ground around the turn and retreated. BUGSY'S WAVE RYDER veered out and bumped with rival at the start, showed response in the opening
quarter then dropped back.
