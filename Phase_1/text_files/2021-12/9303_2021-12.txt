Footnotes
D'VINICRIS showed good speed from the outside then moved clear, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths,
extended the advantage under a right-handed crop into the stretch, switched to a left-handed crop and was given one pop outside the sixteenth-pole then
was placed under a brisk hand ride to the wire while much the best. BOOM BOOM KABOOM settled off the pace, was asked while inside on the turn,
shifted three wide into the stretch under the crop and safely secured the place. DAMILANO broke out and a step slow, was urged along on the outside, went
around the turn in the four path, turned into the stretch under a drive and came up empty while best of the rest. SIR WILLIAM was off slow and spotted the
front several lengths, went around the turn in the three path, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. BIG LITTLE RISK showed speed then
switched out while chasing the pace, went around the turn in the three path, took a bad step inside the five-sixteenths and was eased under restraint, lost
the rider after the wire then was caught by the outrider and vanned off.

ROSEBUG coaxed from the gate, raced five then four wide in closest aim of the leader advancing to take command just inside the five-sixteenths, swung
five wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to inside the eighth pole, then got geared down in the late stages to prevail comfortably on the wire.
DIAMOND COLLECTOR six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped
six to seven wide into upper stretch and chased the winner home well clear of the rest to be along second best. GEOMETRIQUE coaxed from the start,
chased three wide under urging from the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide at the head of the stretch and improved position to secure the show
honors. MARTINI'S AMICA coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, tipped back to the two path with
five-sixteenths to go before angling three to four wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. EXXALTRESS hustled from the start, drifted out early on four
to five paths off the inside showing the way before tucking and settling three wide, tucked along the inside into the turn coming under increasing pressure
from ROSEBUG to the outside, relinquished the front just inside the five-sixteenths while under coaxing, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and gave
way.

Footnotes
INEVTABL CONECTION showed good speed, controlled the action in the two path through the turn, was asked in the three path at the quarter-pole,
responded well under a hand-ride into the final furlong, was given one light tap of a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole then put back to a hand-ride
while much the best. RHUMJAR broke in and bumped with a foe, raced just off the pace, bumped with a rival leaving the backstretch, drafted in the two path
on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, chased the winner in the stretch and proved no match while able to get the place. CATHEDRAL BEACH
tracked the pace on the outside, bumped with an opponent leaving the backstretch, chased in the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and
tired while able to get the show. URBAN FOREST bumped with foes on both sides at the start then checked early, settled off the pace, was urged four wide
on the turn then came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. KOBE'S LEGACY established position just off the pace, chased inside on
the turn, dropped back into the stretch and tired. OUR SHOT came out some at the start then bumped with a foe, moved up to race just off the pace then
dropped back under urging outside the half-mile pole, traveled around the turn in the two path and came up empty. CHECK THAT CHIP bumped with rivals
on both sides at the start then checked early, moved out then settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch,
dropped back while remaining on his inside lead in the drive and capitulated.

near the quarter pole, spun three then two wide straightened away into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, kept on to safely
preserve the place honors. MAKE IT IN NY three wide down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position to just get up for the show honors. CORKMAN hustled from the gate, raced five paths off the

start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, angled four wide at the head of the stretch
and weakened. EL MAYOR showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole under threat to the outside, yielded

Footnotes
MAIDEN BEAUTY was hustled to the front, showed the way while well rated in the two path, responded well when asked on the far turn, came under a
right-handed crop in upper stretch and proved much the best under strong urging. ICE PRINCESS went three wide around the opening bend, stalked the
pace on the outside, was given her cue in the three then four path on the far turn, chased the winner in the stretch and proved no match while able to get
the place. SHARP STARR was taken in hand early, raced in the three path on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, went four then five wide while
roused on the far turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. BYHUBBYHELLOMONEY was
taken in hand early, saved ground on the first turn, was rated off the pace, went around the far turn in the two path, was asked for her best late on that bend
and came up empty. AMITY ISLAND dropped back early, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was reserved at the rear, moved in near the
nine-sixteenths, dropped back along the rail into the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
ESOR established the front and showed the way in hand from the two path slipping away to a comfortable advantage into the turn, remained patiently
handled and came under coaxing when spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive holding clear to the finish to prevail. ALITE
chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the
inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. TOTAL EFFORT chased four then three wide down the backstretch and then
two to three wide through the turn pushed along from three furlongs out, swung four to five wide for home, offered up a mild bid before weakening in the late
stages. MY BOY COLTON chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and kept on for the late major
share. RAISING SAND four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn getting placed to coaxing midway, swung three wide
for home and improved ground to the finish. OCEAN DEEP chased two to three wide down the backstretch before tipping four wide through the turn, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and passed tired foes. NAPOLEON COMPLEX got pinched after the start, chased five to six
wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, cornered six wide for home and made no impact. DEPUTIES EDGE forwardly placed along the inside,
showed speed for a half, came under coaxing at the three-eighths in retreat, took the inside route into upper stretch and faltered. PER NEW YORK GAMING
