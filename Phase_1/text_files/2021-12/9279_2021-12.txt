Footnotes
BLACKADDER broke in and bumped rival at the start, settled outside a rival then off the rail, split foes around the far turn, rallied to the front in midstretch
and drew clear. KHANTARO D'ORO moved down to the two path for the first turn then steered out leaving the bend, bid three deep on the far turn, struck
the front late on the turn, cleared in upper stretch but could not fend off the winner. THIRTY FOUR COUPE chased four then three wide on the clubhouse
turn, bid three deep past the half-mile pole, took over at the three-eighths pole, vied between then dueled on the far turn, lost the lead into the stretch and
flattened to third. LOTTERY PICK tracked the pace in the two path, went between foes then chased off the rail on the backstretch, continued in the two path
to the stretch and lacked a serious bid. CROSBY BEACH was forwardly placed three then two wide on the first turn, pressed the pace on the backstretch
before taking control at the half-mile pole, lost command at the three-eighths, fought to the five-sixteenths and weakened. SWEET SAVANT got bumped
from outside leaving the gate, moved to the inside early while lagging behind, went two wide around the far turn and never threatened. MAYNARD settled
on the inside, tipped two wide on the far turn then angled three to four wide into the stretch but came up empty in the drive. SUNDOWN WARREN traveled
in mid-pack off the inside, exited the far turn four wide and weakened. KLIMTOGLORY sped to the front and took control of the rail, set the pace under
pressure up the backstretch before relinquishing command at the halfway point, dropped back around the far turn, eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
NOTRE DAME got brushed from inside leaving the gate, dueled for the lead outside a rival then cleared to take control nearing the half-mile pole, showed
the way two wide into the stretch and drew away. ESCAPE ROUTE settled off the pace, went two wide into the turn, angled out and came four wide into the
stretch, chased determinedly through the stretch but had to settle for second best. SUMO got knocked into outside rival at the start, tracked the pace outside
a rival then three deep on the turn, could not find more inside the furlong grounds but held the show. SEA TO SUCCESS was away well and dueled inside
NOTRE DAME briefly then could not match strides nearing the half-mile pole, chased inside a pair of rivals to the stretch and flattened through the final
furlong. ROOKIE MISTAKE broke out and bumped rival, dropped back and trailed three then four wide around the turn and failed to menace. HALF RIGHT
tossed his head and came away a bit slow at the start, chased off the rail then between foes into and around the turn, then weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA KOOK broke slow and got bothered a bit from inside, steered inward and was rated in the early going, took the turn two wide then steered
outside the leader in upper stretch, drew alongside with a furlong to go and drew clear under hand urging. LAVA LANE stumbled leaving the gate then went
up to take control, showed the way a bit off the rail and was coaxed two wide entering the stretch, challenged by the winner with a furlong remaining, could
not match strides in deep stretch but was clearly second best. ALOHA KITTEN was forwardly placed along the inside, saved ground to the stretch, roused
past the quarter pole but flattened under right-handed urging but stayed on to secure the show. A NEW PEACE stalked the pace outside rivals, exited the
turn three to four wide and lacked the needed rally. HONOR AMERICA raced up close outside the leader, went two into the turn then tipped out to the three
path and faded through the lane. NAZUNA (IRE) broke out a bit, tracked widest up the backstretch, entered the lane four to five wide and had little left for
the drive.

Footnotes
SHAAZ broke inward to come away a bit slow, chased the pacesetter off the inside, took closer order nearing the turn, advanced four wide around the bend,
took aim at the leader in upper stretch, drifted in some then drew alongside HOPKINS past the sixteenth pole and proved best late. HOPKINS sped to the
front from inside, led two wide into the stretch, continued clear to the eighth pole, pressured by SHAAZ in the final sixteenth and could not hold that rival at
bay. SOY TAPATIO broke out and bumped rival, stalked from inside and saved ground to the stretch, failed to summon the needed response but finished a
clear third. DIXIE'S TWO STENTS stalked the pace off the inside, chased three deep around the bend and flattened in the stretch. PATRON D'ORO was
closest in pursuit to the turn, went two to three wide around the bend and weakened. Q B ONE got bumped leaving the gate, trailed two wide into the turn,
moved to the rail around the bend and was not a factor. ELECTOR stumbled badly leaving the gate, raced greenly up the backstretch, angled from four wide
down to the two path around the turn and failed proved no menace.

Footnotes
EXPRESS TRAIN got bumped from outside and crowded soon after the start, stalked the pacesetter off the inside then went between foes leaving the
backstretch, was asked three wide on the far turn, put in a late bid outside the top pair and got up in time. HOT ROD CHARLIE was forwardly placed in the
early going, off the rail or outside a rival, bid alongside the leader on the far turn, battled down the stretch while brushing with EIGHT RINGS, took a short
lead with a sixteenth remaining and got caught at the wire. EIGHT RINGS sped clear early then gained pressure from inside on the first turn, cleared again
on the backstretch and showed the way through the middle stages, received a challenge from HOT ROD CHARLIE on the far turn, dueled into and down the
lane, brushed with that rival in the drive and yielded grudgingly in the end. GO ON bumped and checked between rivals soon after the start, raced three
wide into the first turn then attempted to angle in and had to check off heels, split foes at the quarter pole and angled out into the stretch, continued willingly
through the stretch run and bested the rest. AZUL COAST traveled three to four wide on the first turn, tracked three deep into the second bend, moved out
to the four path on that turn and failed to rally in the lane. EXTRA HOPE stumbled leaving the gate but still came away quickly, went up to press the pace
from inside on the first turn then chased the leader up the backstretch, continued along the rail into the lane and weakened in the late stages. KISS TODAY
GOODBYE went four wide around the first turn, sat at the back outside a rival, went three wide into the second bend then moved out and came five wide
into the lane, tired and was eased to the wire and walked off.

LAW PROFESSOR was closest in pursuit of the lead while off the rail, bid outside with five-sixteenths remaining, took control in upper stretch, continued to
duel holding a narrow advantage through the final furlong and prevailed under urging. BEYOND BRILLIANT set the pace in the two path around the
clubhouse turn then moved inside, met the challenge from LAW PROFESSOR at the five-sixteenths pole and carried a short lead into the drive, relinquished
command in upper stretch but continued to battle back along the rail and finished gamely to the wire. TARANTINO chased between foes around the first
turn while two then three wide, raced in the clear up the backstretch from off the pace, angled out on the second bend and came four wide into the stretch,
summoned a mild rally and outkicked NONE ABOVE THE LAW for the show honors. NONE ABOVE THE LAW traveled in mid-pack along the inside then
moved off the rail in the middle stages, chased two wide into the far turn then angled inside a runner then tipped back out to the two path leaving the bend,
could not find the needed late kick to threaten the top pair and got edged for the show. DU JOUR got brushed leaving the gate, raced in mid-pack outside a
rival, traveled three deep with three-eighths remaining, came three wide into the lane and failed to menace. AIRMAN was off a bit slow to begin, unhurried
while guided down to the inside early, was pushed upon through the far turn but lacked the needed response. CANE CREEK ROAD stalked the pace from
inside, lost ground past the half-mile marker, dropped back on the far turn, tired in the lane and was eased to the wire. FLASHIEST brushed with outside
rival and lost his path at the start, went three deep around the first turn, chased off the rail in the middle stages, dropped back around the far turn and came
four wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive. THREE-QUARTER FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.

KALYPSO stalked the top pair in the early stages, traveled along the inside into the turn then steered out to the three path around the bend, bid three deep
in upper stretch, reached front at the eighth pole, kicked clear and won going away. BRILLIANT CUT pressed the pace from outside early on, headed the
leader at the five-sixteenths pole, battled into the stretch, vied between runners approaching the eighth pole, could not match strides with KALYPSO in deep
stretch and finished willingly to best the rest. LIVINGMYBESTLIFE came away alertly from outside, cleared early and moved inward then gained company to
the outside, held a short lead into the turn then got headed by BRILLIAN CUT with five-sixteenths remaining, fought back from inside then relinquished
control with a furlong to run and stayed on to hold the show. EDDIE'S NEW DREAM chased outside a rival or two wide around the turn, could not summon
the needed rally but got up for a minor award. CANOODLING chased along the inside to the stretch and never threatened. PRIVATE MISSION got bumped,
checked and dropped back early, chased three wide around the turn, moved out in the stretch and could not rally. MISSY P. bumped with PRIVATE
MISSION early, tracked the pacesetter off the rail, dropped back between rivals on the turn, trailed three wide into the stretch, eased in the lane and walked
off.

SUPER GAME pressed the pace from outside into and around the turn, was asked in upper stretch, responded well and surged clear approaching the
eighth pole and drew off in the final furlong. FANTAIL (GB) set the pace from inside under pressure, held command in the two path into the lane, was
overtaken in upper stretch, could not kick on with the winner in the furlong grounds but was clearly second best. KALON settled early off the rail, went
outside a pair of rivals on the turn then took aim four wide into the stretch but faltered in the final furlong. ANOTHER EDDIE stalked outside a rival, three
wide into the turn, moved to the two path then angled out entering the stretch and could not rally. RAPID TRANSIT brushed the gate in the beginning,
chased off the rail then angled in on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
FLIGHTLINE was off a bit slow to begin, bumped with DR. SCHIVEL then went up to take control, cleared rivals with three-eighths remaining, inched away
around the bend, drew off in upper stretch and widened under confident handling. BABY YODA pressed from the inside early, could not keep up with the
leader but continued to give chase from inside through the turn, exited the bend two wide and stayed on to secure second. STILLETO BOY received a few
bumps from outside early, raced in range off the inside, took the turn three then four wide and lacked the needed response. TRIPLE TAP settled early
outside rivals, entered the turn five wide, shifted to the three path around the bend and proved no menace. TIMELESS BOUNTY got shuffled between rivals
early and dropped to the back, moved out and went four wide into the turn, angled down to the two path around the bend and failed to make an impact.
TEAM MERCHANTS raced up close outside the pacesetter, was driven three wide into the stretch and faded. DR. SCHIVEL got pinballed and squeezed
between runners early, tracked the pacesetter outside a rival, went four then five wide on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
QUEEN GODDESS sprinted clear early, kicked clear into the far turn, remained unchallenged to the stretch, continued clear into the furlong grounds and
inched away under right-handed urging and strong handling. NICEST (IRE) came away a step slow, settled off the rail, went four deep on the far turn then
angled down to the two path, put in a mild bid in the stretch but faltered in the final sixteenth. FLUFFY SOCKS trailed early on, raced off the rail to the far
turn, split foes at the three-eighths pole, was driven three wide into the stretch and gained the show. IVY LEAGUE stalked the pace outside a rival, raced
three deep at the three-eighths pole, shifted down to the two path around the bend, moved out in the stretch and could not rally. SINGLE SOUL (GB) stalked
three wide early, remained closest in pursuit to the far turn, lost position around the bend and weakened in the stretch. GOING GLOBAL (IRE) went two
wide around the first turn, got put in tight quarters between foes at the five-eighths pole, took closer order into the far turn, advanced through that bend, took
aim from inside entering the stretch but weakened in the late stages. CLOSING REMARKS sat off the pace off the rail, came three wide into the lane and
was eased and walked off. CHARGES DROPPED traveled in mid-pack near the inside, entered the stretch two to three wide, shifted inward in upper stretch
and had little left. BURGOO ALLEY (IRE) steered to the inside first time through the stretch, stalked the pacesetter while in range, dropped back around the
far turn, tired and eased in the lane and walked off. CORE VALUES reserved early on the inside, tipped two wide leaving the far turn and was not a factor.
