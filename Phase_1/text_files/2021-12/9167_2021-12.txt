JET SET WARRIOR was up close early, raced six wide, took control in early stretch and drew off as an easy winner. KATE'S WARRIOR was not far back
early, raced five wide into the turn, was no match and finished second best. MAMIE'S WARRIOR was void of any early speed, went four wide into the turn,
angled in and was along for third. LAUGHING STORM tracked the early pace, raced seven wide and was empty late. RARE COIN set a pressured early
pace from the inside and weakened. CASH CRUZER was unhurried early and was no factor. CHA CHING CHARLIE forced the early pace from off the rail
and faded.
