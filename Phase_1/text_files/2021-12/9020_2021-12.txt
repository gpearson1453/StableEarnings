Footnotes
HOME VISIT unhurried in the early part, moved up, four wide around the final turn, rallied down the stretch and proved the best late. CHARCO went to the
front, drove clear, saved ground, proved no match late for the winner, but was best of others. DONNIE BOY raced in the rear in the beginning, made a late
rail bid, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. SMOOTH RIVER pressed the early pace and faded. JANET'S DEVIL raced within contention,
saved ground around the final turn and dropped back.

the second turn, couldn't match strides the winner, but held on for second. HIDDEN EXPECTATION void of early speed, saved ground around the final turn,
gained ground down the stretch, while racing on the rail, angled out, split rivals and finished willingly. DESERT GLOW raced within contention, came around
the final turn three wide and hung down the stretch. MALIBU ROSE lacked early speed, moved up, within striking distance and flattened out down the lane.
T R'S FIRST raced evenly near the back, had a wide trip and was never a factor. PENNIE'S MAGIC raced within striking distance and faded. L G GIRL
lacked early speed, had a wide trip and was never a threat. TOOSIE raced in the middle of the field and dropped back.

KING NATE lacked early speed, racing in the rear, moved up on the outside around the second turn and ran by RIVER KING down the lane, drawing clear
before the wire. RIVER KING sprinted to the front, drove clear, led until late, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. FUNNY ACTOR raced
near the back, made a mild bid, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. DRIVER raced within contention, saved ground around the second
turn and faded. BAYOU BEAUX pressed the early pace, faded and finished evenly. CHACHING BLING void of early speed and was never close. BOBBY
BOOTS raced in the middle of the field and dropped to the back.

FEE pressed the pace, racing outside around the first turn, dueled down the home stretch and was outfinished for the win. SUCH raced within striking
distance, made a late bid and proved no match for the top two. LIAM SKYE unhurried in the beginning, came around the second turn four wide, moved up,
but was no factor. RED WINED UP sprinted to the front, drove clear and faded. STEPPIN' OUTONHER raced evenly near the back and was never a threat.
MR. GRACEFUL always raced near the back and showed little.

UNION STATION unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a rally down the stretch and was going away at the end.
DUSTY HILL dueled for the early lead, saved ground around the second turn, proved no match for the winner, but held on for second. JACKMAN raced
within striking distance, made a bid and was gaining on DUSTY HILL for place, while finishing willingly. OUTERBANKS lacked early speed, showed late
interest, but was no factor. VELVET RIDGE raced in the middle of the pack, saved ground around the final turn and put forth an even effort. DUST EM raced
evenly near back, came around the final turn wide and was no threat. SCRAPPY ARTIE vied for the early lead and was finished early. JAZZ IT UP raced
within contention, came around the first turn wide and dropped back. DRIED PEPPER void of early speed and showed little.

Footnotes
MISS E. FU went to the front, drove clear, led throughout, was all out and held on for the win. KASEN'S SISTER pressed the pace, forwardly placed
throughout, rallied down the home stretch, gained ground, but was outfinished, while putting forth a game effort. ALBERTA MOON raced within contention,
saved ground around the final turn and followed the top two to the wire. CUSTOMS BELLA ELLA raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort.
LUMBERJACK EMPIRE lacked early speed, raced wide around the first turn, moved up, but was no factor. GO MY JULIET raced evenly near the back and
was no threat. MY BABY BELE always raced near the back and was outrun. BLAMEITONTHEJOCK void of early speed and showed little.
