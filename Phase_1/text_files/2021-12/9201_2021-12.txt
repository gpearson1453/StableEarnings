CAN'TBETEMALL well placed with a three wide bid into far turn to the lead, clear in the stretch and held sway to the wire under stout handling. INCLUSIVE
trouble trip throughout, ended up widest into stretch and missed while might have been best. UGLY DUCKLING tracked from off rail, rallied late stretch to
just miss place. IT'S GAME TIME off tardy, raced rank first turn, settle in to far turn, mildly. CACAHUETE chased pave to the half, weakened from far turn,
faded. RECKLESS L J sent to lead, loped along to far turn, weakened from eighth pole. SHELL FIRE tracked inside to the half, gave way readily. LIZZY'S
LURE faded back from the half.
