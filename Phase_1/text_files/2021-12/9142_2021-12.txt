Footnotes
MISS MESS broke out, brushed rival, shot to the front, drove clear, led throughout and won under steady urging. LIL' SISTER LOU raced within contention,
forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but got up for place. DROP O' CHOCOLATE pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn
and was outfinished for second. CHICKEN OR THE EGG void of early speed, showed late interest, finished wide and was no factor. GABY'S PROMISE
raced near the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. WISH FOR INTEREST lacked early speed, improved position, but was no threat.
YOUNMEHONEYBUNNY raced in the middle of the pack in the beginning and faded. I'M ALL MIXED UP bumped at the start, pressed the pace, saved
ground around the turn and dropped back. RIVETRIX void of early speed and showed little.

Footnotes
SIMPLY WICKED vied for early lead, saved ground around the final turn, took the advantage down the home stretch and won under steady urging. D T'S
DREAM shot to the front, dueled throughout on the front end, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. OTTOMAN EMPIRE raced in the middle
of the field, moved up around the final turn, made a mild bid and followed the top two to the wire. BUDDY REAUX raced near the back, had an outside trip,
made a mild bid, but was no factor. WEDINGTON flashed early speed, saved ground around the second turn and faded. DOWN COLD raced within striking
distance and dropped back. EXCLAIM raced in the back of the pack and showed little. INDEFENSIBLE void of early speed and was never close.

Footnotes
KLASSY POINT raced within contention, moved up around the turn, angled out entering the stretch, drove clear and finished strong. UNTAMED MONEY
pressed the pace, raced outside around the turn, proved no match late for the winner, but was best of rest. SLEWPY'S HALO raced within striking distance,
made a mild bid and proved no match for the top two. THAT IS AWESOME raced in the middle of the field, came around the turn wide, improved position,
but was no factor. REMI'S ROSE pressed the early pace, moved up and challenged for the lead and faded. CLEVERINDA void of early speed, improved
position, but was no threat. FROIDEUR raced evenly near the back, finished wide and showed little. ANNIE'S LUCK lacked early speed and was never a
threat. MISS LINDA LOU shot to the front, drove clear, moved inside and dropped back. HOT SENSATION had an awkward start and was never close.
