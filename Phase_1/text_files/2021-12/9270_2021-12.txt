Footnotes
BAZZARINA broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage between foes in the opening stages, angled to the rail after the opening quarter, held
sway into the turn, then turned back rivals racing past midstretch to go well clear late under right handed pressure. TIZ LOTTIE tracked the pacesetter along
the inside racing to the bend, tipped out three wide in the stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors late. SWEET TINA was
urged while shifting inwards to prompt the pacesetter between rivals racing into the turn, moved to terms with the leader nearing upper stretch, pressed the
issue to midstretch but proved no match late while losing second. MYRA FLEENER tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn, angled
inwards racing into upper stretch but offered no rally. SPANISH DELIGHT, urged along three wide prompting the pacesetter for five furlongs, gave way into
the lane. AWESOME WINNA trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ROCKYSBUCKAROO broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin remaining off the rail racing into the turn, continued in the three path through the
bend, then was roused to go clear through the stretch under some right handed pressure. GEMO switched off the inside in the opening stages tracking the
leaders from just out of striking distance, then shifted inwards racing into the lane to gain the place honors from between foes. MR. EDGAR was urged to
terms with the pacesetter prompting the pacesetter in the four path racing into the turn, pressed the issue between foes nearing upper stretch but weakened
in the drive. SUNSHINE CHARLIE tracked the leaders inside foes racing the turn, saved ground to upper stretch but had no final bid. I KICKN, reluctant to
load in the gate, broke slowly, shifted out to the five path while being urged in pursuit of the leaders racing into the turn and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
PLATINUM GEM broke readily, dictated the pace on a clear margin inside foes racing into the bend, then held sway to the end while being kept to steady
pressure. EROS'S GIRL tracked off the first flight outside rivals racing to the turn, was prompted to advance while shifting inwards racing into upper stretch
and proved best of the others. SHE'S PEACHY KEEN broke readily, was prompted in pursuit of the pacesetter three deep in early stages, continued in that
path to upper stretch and weakened in the drive. SNEAKY CHEEKY tracked off the first flight between foes racing through the backstretch, lost some
position when shuffled a bit in traffic on the turn and had no closing bid. ROYAL ENGAGEMENT, urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter racing into
the turn, gave way on the turn. JACKKNIFE tracked the leaders along the inside racing to the bend and steadily faded into the stretch. FOLLOWING THE
RACE, THE RIDER OF SNEAKY CHEEKY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF ERO'S GIRl ALLEGING INTERFERENCE ON THE
TURN, BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

SKIPPERINI switched outside rivals racing into the first turn to track the leaders from just out of striking position, was prompted to advance three wide
entering the far turn, pressed the issue in that path through the stretch and edged forward under firm encouragement. FIERCE WARRIOR was settled
outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three, then four wide racing into upper stretch and secured the place
honors in time. GREAT BRITAIN, urged to forward placing while angling to the inside leaving the chute, switched outside the pacesetter tracking that foe on
the backstretch, was urged to press the issue between foes on the far turn into upper stretch while striking the front momentarily but weakened in late
stages. PANADERO, reserved near the inside in the opening stages, tipped out racing into the backstretch to track the leaders between foes, was prompted
to advance nearing the lane, shifted three deep in the stretch and continued with interest to gain some position between foes. MEROKEE, urged to the lead
racing through the chute, angled to the rail once gaining a clear advantage entering the first turn, set the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled
inside foes through the second bend and gave way racing past midstretch. AGENT COOPER, forwardly placed just off the inside racing to the first turn, was
taken back while shifting to the inside racing into the backstretch, dropped out last on the far turn, then swung five wide racing through the stretch to make a
belated second effort. CHAOTIC TEMPO was rated off the first flight inside foes in the opening half, steadied a bit along the rail entering the far turn, was
roused to advance along the inside entering the lane, shifted out avoiding a tiring rival in the closing stages, then finished in hand through the final sixteenth
when lacking a final response.

Footnotes
ISAIAS DREAM, bumped at the start, was reserved between foes racing to the first turn, tipped out three wide entering the backstretch, gradually drew into
range racing in that path through the far turn, produced a solid closing response shifting inwards through the stretch splitting rivals to bid inside the winner
and just collared that foe in time under firm left handed pressure. CREATIVE CHOICE, forwardly placed along the inside in the opening stages, switched out
attending a rival's pace racing through the backstretch, moved to take over nearing upper stretch, held sway well off the inside through the stretch but
couldn't fend off the winner. SWIFT KID was settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, angled out five wide racing into the lane and continued with a
steady late response to close the gap while gaining a share. SHIPWRECK was urged to a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter along the inside in
the opening half, shifted out three wide while being prompted to advance nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. KING FORCE, bumped at
the start, was reserved along the inside to the backstretch, swung out four wide racing into the lane and made an effort to gain some position. GIOVANE'S
PROMISE tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight from well out of striking distance in the opening half but offered no closing bid.
BLACK LIMO, rated inside foes to the backstretch, steadily faded nearing the lane. PALACE SINGER, bumped at the start, angled to the inside tracking the
leaders in second flight while racing well off the leaders and emptied out early. JOHNNIE GOT JETS, urged to the lead outside foes racing through the
chute, angled to the rail once clear entering the first turn, set the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn and abruptly gave out nearing upper stretch.
MARCH MAGIC, caught a bit wide racing to the first turn while being prompted to contend, retreated early.

Footnotes
AMANI'S IMAGE took up a position tracking the leaders outside a rival from just out of striking distance racing through the backstretch into the turn, tipped
out three wide midstretch to split foes in the closing stages, then wrested the advantage and went clear under firm left handed pressure. ILLOGICAL LOVE
broke sharply, switched well off the rail racing past the chute to dictate the pace on a narrow advantage, maintained that margin racing in the two path into
upper stretch but proved no match for the winner while narrowly prevailing for the place honors. SWEET DUTCHESS angled to the inside tracking the
leaders as part of the second flight, was urged along saving ground through the turn to gain position inside foes late but was just outkicked for second.
GWENDOLA settled last near the inside racing well off the leaders to the turn, gradually closed the gap nearing upper stretch, angled out five wide in upper
stretch, was fanned to the six path avoiding a drifting rival but continued with a belated effort to close the gap while just missing for a share. STANDUP
COMEDIENNE was urged prompting the pacesetter from well off the inside racing into the turn, continued in the four path into upper stretch, then drifted out
in the closing stages while steadily faded from contention. ROMA MONA made brief pursuit of the leaders in the four path on the backstretch but retreated
early.

Footnotes
HYPE MAN was settled well off the pace racing outside foes to the backstretch, steadily gained momentum shifting three wide on the far turn, swung out
five wide nearing upper stretch, shifted inwards under pressure but was righted to wrest the advantage in time under firm handling. PLEASANT VALUE was
rated tracking the leaders from out striking distance inside a rival as part of the second flight for five furlongs, steadily closed the gap on the leaders while
tipping out three deep to bid between foes nearing upper stretch, moved away to a clear advantage while shifting to the inside late, resisted the winner's bid
but came up second best. STAYIN OR STRAYIN tracked the leaders from out of striking distance outside a rival in second flight, advanced in tandem with
that foe to close the gap on the leaders while being fanned four wide nearing upper stretch, then lacked the need final kick while prevailing for a share.
BEACH BANDIT was rated off the second flight near the inside racing to the lane, switched out four wide in upper stretch, then angled inwards while being
prompted to advance between foes but had no final response. RAMIRIN tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, lost some
position between foes entering the far turn, then angled five wide in the closing stages to make an effort to gain some position while no real threat. OSABA
settled into stride along the inside early and never gained contention. LIL CROWN ducked inwards at the start momentarily impeding BYRON'S GOLD, was
righted, then urged to a forward placing prompting the pacesetter to the first turn, tracked just off that foe on the backstretch, then lodged a brief bid racing
through the far turn but emptied out abruptly in upper stretch. JERICHOS BATTLE, urged to the lead along the inside, sprinted clear into the backstretch,
dictated the pace into the far turn and gave out abruptly entering the stretch. BYRON'S GOLD, off slowly, then forced in at the start, came under pressure to
gain some position early but had no response and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RUNNING VIOLENCE, prominent between foes in the three path disputing the pace from the outset to the turn, pressed the issue three wide between foes
into upper stretch and edged forward late under brisk right handed pressure. THREENINETYTWO, forwardly placed inside foes in the opening stages, was
eased back off the leaders racing into the turn, was prompted to advance just off the rail to bid between foes nearing midstretch and contested the issue to
the end while failing to match the winner's kick. THE BEAST GOES ON, off last, settled in the last flight inside foes racing through the backstretch, saved
ground through the turn gaining momentum, bid for command nearest the rail approaching midstretch but was outkicked by the top pair. SIAKAM was rated
just off the first flight between foes in the opening quarter, shifted to the inside approaching the turn to bid for command inside rivals, pressed the issue into
the stretch but flattened out leaving the furlong marker. LIL BULL, in touch with the first flight five wide, then four wide between foes racing into the turn,
continued to contest the issue into upper stretch but faded in late stages. STARSHIP OREO broke outwards bumping UNCLEJACKAMO, was reserved
between foes in the last flight to the turn, then continued evenly three deep while racing in close quarters late. UNCLEJACKOMO was bumped, then
stumbled at the start, was righted to make brief pursuit of the leaders six wide on the backstretch, continued five wide into the turn and soon gave way.
DENY, urged to contend four wide between foes in the opening stages, dropped back nearing the turn. ACTION WARRIOR proved no factor.

Footnotes
LAST SECOND LOUIE angled inwards while being urged to prompt the pace outside a rival racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow
advantage through the backstretch, dueled inside a rival on the far turn into upper stretch while losing the advantage, but responded to firm handling and left
handed pressure to regain the lead in time. MACHINEGUNPREACHER, caught in close quarters just after the start, was rated well off the second flight to
the backstretch, was prompted to advance while shifting out four wide racing through the far turn and continued with a steady late response to close the gap
on the winner while edging a rival for the place honors. MEAN JOE BRO tracked just off the first flight racing to the first turn, advanced three wide into the
backstretch to press the issue outside the eventual winner into the second bend, gained the advantage racing into upper stretch but failed to sustain his
momentum. BRAMBLE BEACH was rated off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three wide racing through the far turn,
shifted inwards under pressure in the closing stages and lacked the needed final kick. OCTOBER TIME was rated off the first flight along the inside in the
opening half, tipped outside a tiring foe to race between foes on the far turn, then shifted five wide in the closing stages but failed to mount a rally.
GRABBING THE MONEY settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was fanned six wide into the stretch and passed some tiring rivals.
STRONG EAGLE, caught in tight quarters just after the start, was reserved along the inside early, switched outside foes nearing the lane but offered no
rally. BOSSHOG THEM DUKES tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch and steadily faded racing into the far turn. CAPTURED
DREAMS, urged along the rail prompting the pace, gave way after a half. KARL CARES, bumped at the start, was held up between foes in the last flight
early, came under under pressure to contend inside foes racing into the backstretch and soon retreated.
