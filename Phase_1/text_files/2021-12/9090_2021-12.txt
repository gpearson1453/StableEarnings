dueled inside and tired. PRINCESS EMMA JO vied outside for the lead, dueled two wide on the turn, battled to midstretch and tired. RUBY DOOBY DOO

NOON TIME GEM set a pressured pace inside, moved cleat in the stretch and remained safe while kept to his task. ESPRESSO CALIENTE prompted the
winner outside and made a gradual late again. KRISTI'S COPILOT saved ground under rating then went evenly in the stretch. BIG BAD BUD lacked speed,
chased wide on the turn and was no factor. DR HARLAN was urged close up outside for half a mile and weakened. MASS APPEAL made a menacing four
wide bid on the turn then gave way. BIG CITY RALPH trailed throughout while bearing out and lost contact with his field.

Footnotes
TERRY'S CHARM raced off the pace inside, advanced on the backside, moved up quickly on the far turn, bid at the quarter pole, took over, drew off and
widened under urging. MY MAN ELVIS raced three wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace, came three wide into the lane, rallied mildly outside and got
up for second at the wire. DIDNT DO IT broke out bumping a rival at the start, set the pace, shook clear on the backside, was no match for the winner when
challenged, dug in through the lane and lost second at the wire. STAYNSIDETHECIRCLE was outrun early, came three wide into the lane and closed
belatedly. BOAT OVER THE HILL was bumped at the start, raced off the pace, advanced two wide on the far turn, then lacked a rally. EL BORRACHO was
outrun early and passed tired ones. BILL'S MAFIA raced close up inside in the early stages, then stalked, chased and gave way. KID MAC COOL chased
inside and gave way.

EXCURSION raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the turn, angled out for the drive, closed steadily outside in the final furlong, surged late and was
just up at the wire. HOISTTHEMAINSAIL stalked two wide, bid on the turn, dueled into the stretch, edged away from INSTAFAMOUS nearing the sixteenth
marker, dug in gamely and was nailed in the final jump. INSTAFAMOUS set the pace, dueled inside on the turn, battled with HOISTTHEMAINSAIL in upper
stretch, dug in gamely and then yielded. BUFFALO SHUFFLE tracked on the inside, chased on the turn, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly.
FLIMFLAM MAN stalked the pace, chased three wide on the turn and weakened. WE BE THERE raced two wide off the pace and failed to threaten.
