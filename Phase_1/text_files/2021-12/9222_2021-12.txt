Footnotes
MOGALU stalked the pace two wide, took over in upper stretch, drew clear near the sixteenth pole and just held. JINXED (IRE) was in range two wide,
tipped out in upper stretch, made little gain while still on the left lead, switched over leaving the eighth pole, surged late and just missed. SWIFT DANCER
set the pace along the rail, was collared in upper stretch and held well enough to preserve the show. ICING steadied at the start, raced three wide in
midpack and lacked the needed rally. STRAIGHT TIME was reluctant to load, hit the starting gate, chased the pace inside and lacked a closing bid.
CARNIVORE saved ground and failed to menace. BOURBON READY was bumped at the start then made little impact while racing two wide. JEST ABOVE
broke a bit awkwardly and bumped BOURBON READY, saved ground and was outrun. JET WINGS hit the gate, took some awkward strides down the
backstretch, was taken in hand, settled near the turn, raced three wide and was factor. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
UKIYO broke sharply and lead the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn,
drifted out mildly in late stretch and dueled gamely to the wire, getting the head bob for the win. ONLY TIME saved ground around the first turn, chased the
leader up the backstretch on the inside, moved up to challenge from the two path passing the three eighths pole and dueled gamely the length of the
stretch, just missing. SOUL OF AN ANGEL raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace between horses, angled in
to save ground around the far turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and improved position down the lane, the best of the rest. KEEN KINGDOM
raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the far turn from the three path and gained
ground mildly late. MOUNTAIN BELLATRIX raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around
the far turn in the two path and was outkicked in the final furlong. MAGIC SURPRISE saved ground around the first turn, trailed far behind the field up the
backstretch and around the far turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch while never threatening. RECORD raced in the middle of the pack in the four path
around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and faded down the lane. GIRLY THE BUTCHER saved ground
around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the far turn and continued to tire
from there.

DOO WOP DON pressed PERSONAL MEADOW from outside early, took over just before completing a half-mile, shifted to the rail drawing clear through
upper stretch, and continued to widen under a drive. NO COMMISSION pursued the leaders four wide to the stretch, and wore down PERSONAL
MEADOW from outside to take the place. PERSONAL MEADOW set the pace removed from the rail, proved no match for the winner coming to the
quarter-pole, and weakened through the drive. YOUNG FLINT broke slowly, and was outrun inside. LARGE was outpaced around the turn, and drifted six
wide tiring into the lane.

VALIANT AVENGER dueled three wide between foes to midstretch then drove clear. PRINCE MARCO hit the starting gate, saved ground off the duel in the
clear around the turn, was lugging in through the stretch and rallied for the place. SHEA D CAPTURE pressed the pace four wide, could not quite keep pace
with the winner in the lane but churned on to hold the show. BOURBON OVER ICE dueled two wide between foes and weakened in the final furlong. INNER
WAVE broke in a tangle, raced three wide and made little impact. KNIGHTS BIRD dueled inside of three foes, tired in the lane and was eased. RULING
FRONT had brief speed inside. HECTOR B trailed throughout and was easing through the lane.

SWEET MELANIA saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path passing the three
eighths pole, dueled outside down the lane and got up in the final strides. SHIFTY SHE was sent to the early lead while saving ground around the first turn,
continued to show the way from the rail while racing up the backstretch and around the far turn, was joined by a challenger entering the stretch and dueled
gamely on the inside down the lane, giving way late. IN A HURRY saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch,
continued to save ground around the far turn, and chased the frontrunners home, finishing well and gaining in the final sixteenth of a mile. KEEPER OF
TIME (IRE) saved ground around the first turn, raced inside at the back of the pack for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path,
switched to the outside with a furlong to go and gained ground on the outside to the wire. SUMMERING raced in the four and five path around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch off the pace on the far outside, began a bid from the two path passing the three eighths pole, brushed lightly with ALMS near
the eighth pole and gained ground mildly between horses from there. KELSEY'S CROSS raced in the three path at the back of the pack around the first turn
and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path, swung wide entering the stretch and improved position late. ALMS raced four wide
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch on the outside in the middle of the pack, began to improve position while racing in the two path around the
turn and in upper stretch, drifted out mildly near the eighth pole, brushing with SUMMERING in the process and weakened in the final sixteenth of a mile.
DAWN'S DANCER trailed the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the far turn, swung wide
entering the stretch, and improved position mildly on the far outside while never threatening. PRINCESS CAUSEWAY raced in the two path around the first
turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace between horses, angled in to save ground around the far turn and flattened out on the rail in the final furlong.
CLASSIC LADY raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground
around the far turn and tired in the final furlong. QUIET COMPANY angled in to race in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in
the middle of the pack between horses, raced in the two path around the far turn and faded entering the stretch. LA BABIA raced off the pace in the two

DANCE D'ORO set the pace up the backstretch pressed from outside by GRAN BABY, moved away from that rival on the turn, widened into the stretch
under a full drive, and was kept to pressure to remain clear. DON'T GET KHOZY was outsprinted for six furlongs, came three wide off the turn and closed a
late gap clearly second best. ALLWORTHY broke inward, saved ground in range to the turn, was put to an all-out drive shifting three wide before completing
six furlongs, and had no closing punch. QUEEN NEKIA trailed inside to the top of the stretch, and gained only mildly. GRAN BABY (CHI) pressed DANCE
D'ORO from outside, could not keep pace on the turn, and drifted five wide tiring at the top of the stretch. DREAM MARIE drifted six wide past the
quarter-pole, was in the process of being pulled up when she unseated the rider past the eighth-pole, was apprehended favoring her right front, and was
vanned off.

Footnotes
EARTH pressed the pace two wide, drew clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. STAR WEAVER lacked early speed, raced five wide around
the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and rallied outside to gain the place in the final strides. MARCELINO tracked the pace two and three wide,
had aim outside of the winner in upper stretch and was outkicked. GREAT BLAKE raced off the pace three wide, swung out in upper stretch and rallied
between rivals. BERHANU chased the pace four wide and was one-paced in the lane. BACKWOODS BOOGIE chased the pace two wide and lacked the
needed rally. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR stumbled at the start, saved ground and never threatened. SKY MAGICIAN played no factor while racing four wide
and was vanned off. HURRICANE HILL failed to menace while racing three wide. KITTEN STREET was outrun inside. TENACITY ZIP played no factor
while racing four wide. ALLEGEDLY PERFECT set the pace along the rail and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
CENTER AISLE stumbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to press the pace on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path
around the turn, dueled gamely down the lane and pulled ahead late. FRANK'S ROCKETTE hit the gate leaving it, dueled for the lead between horses up
the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn, and raced gamely down the stretch, giving way grudgingly in the final sixteenth of a
mile. BRONX BEAUTY trailed the field on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, began to move up while saving ground around the turn, launched
a bid entering the stretch and chased the frontrunners home, no match for those two. MUSIC CITY STAR chased the frontrunning pack up the backstretch,
raced four wide around the turn, began a mild bid nearing the quarter pole, gained ground in upper stretch and was outkicked from there. LORILOUPIES
hopped up leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle while racing three wide around the turn,
gave way entering the stretch and weakened further in the final furlong. SOSUA raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of
a mile, trailed the field from the two path around the turn, and passed tiring horses in the lane while never threatening. QUINOA TIFAH dueled for the lead
on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the turn, drifted out entering the stretch and continued to tire from
there. COMPENSATE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the three path was carried wide coming off
the turn, and was empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
FEARLESS went around the first turn unhurried four wide, stalked the leaders up the backstretch alone in third, ranged up to take over outside MIGHTY
HEART and BLUE STEEL after six furlongs, and widened through the stretch under a mild drive. SOUTH BEND was washy going to post, settled well off
the early pace, shifted out five wide coming off the far turn, and rallied for the place while never a threat to the winner. MIGHTY HEART sped clear early
inside, sparred with BLUE STEEL up the backstretch and into the far turn, could not withstand FEARLESS after six furlongs and salvaged the show while
weakening. BLUE STEEL pursued outside MIGHTY HEART four then three wide early, went up to engage that rival leaving the first turn, and faltered
between horses soon after completing six furlongs. TWENTY TWICE broke slowest, was outrun early inside, and dropped hopelessly far back before
reaching the stretch. EYE OF A JEDI was pulled up entering the far turn, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
DOSWELL broke sharply, set a rated pace inside, opened up in upper stretch and held clear under confident handling. ATONE settled off the early pace
three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, had aim outside of the winner in upper stretch but was unable to reel in that foe. ENGLISH BEE
tracked the winner from the rail and was one-paced through the stretch to maintain third. SPACE TRAVELLER (GB) rated back and angled into the two path
nearing the first turn, raced off the pace between foes early, advanced four wide around the far turn but lacked the needed stretch rally. L'IMPERATOR (FR)
saved ground off the pace, was urged along nearing the far turn, continued to race at the rail around that bend and improved position without threatening.
SOLE VOLANTE broke a bit awkwardly, saved ground well back, angled out nearing the head of the lane and had a mild belated rally. RENAISANCE
FROLIC chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. BREAKING THE RULES lacked early speed while racing two wide, came out and bumped
MEDIA BLITZ midway around the first turn and played no further factor. ORDER AND LAW bobbled and was bumped at the start, raced two wide and never
threatened. MEDIA BLITZ steadied off heels nearing the first turn, was bumped midway around that bend, raced three to four wide and played no factor.
ANALYZE IT prompted the winner two wide and retreated through the lane. KING GUILLERMO broke outwardly and bumped ORDER AND LAW, raced in
range two wide for six furlongs then faltered. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
WAKE SURF stumbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leader while saving ground around the first turn, moved up to press the pace on the
outside up the backstretch, dueled for the lead from the two path around the far turn and continued to battle down the lane, getting bumped by SOSUA
SUMMER midstretch and pulling clear late. RIDLEY'S MAJOR raced off the pace in the three path through the opening half mile, began to improve position
while racing in the two path around the far turn, continued his bid passing the quarter pole, and gained ground steadily down the stretch while drifting out in
the final furlong. IMMOKALEE dropped back to trail the field while saving ground the first time by, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack on
the outside, raced in the two path around the turn, improved position in upper stretch, was forced out slightly when RIDLEY'S MAJOR drifted into his path
and continued to gain ground to the wire. SOSUA SUMMER brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, led the field while racing a bit rankly into
the first turn, settled while saving ground from there, dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around the far turn, drifted out approaching the eighth pole,
brushing with WAKE SURF in the process and gave way late. VERSATILE saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside
up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and faded in the stretch. MISBEHAVED raced into traffic on the rail headed into the first
turn and steadied slightly, switched to the outside and entered the backstretch in the four path, continued on the outside in the middle of the pack from there,
began a mild bid while saving ground approaching the three eighths pole and flattened out in the final furlong. JUKEBOX JUJU brushed with the horse to his
inside leaving the gate, raced in the two path at the back of the pack around the first turn and up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and
never fired. MIFFLIN hit the gate leaving it, recovered to chase the leader from the two path around the first turn, raced between horses up the backstretch,
