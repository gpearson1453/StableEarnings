Footnotes
SIR LONDON sped to the front from inside and cleared early on the clubhouse turn, got headed into the backstretch, set the pace under pressure to the far
turn, cleared past the three-eighths pole, drew off into the stretch and widened through the lane under hand urging and coasted in late. PORTSMOUTH got
floated four wide into the first turn then moved back to the three path, stalked the top pair off the rail, came four wide into the lane and kept on for a clear
second while unable to threaten the winner. WESLEYAN got floated five wide into the first turn then shifted to the four path, went up to force the pace into
the backstretch, lost contact with the winner past the three-eighths pole, chased three wide into the stretch and weakened. EGOMANIA came away slow,
went three wide into the first turn then angled to the rail, continued along the inside into the far turn, angled four to five wide on the second bend and failed
to menace. L L L COOL pulled while rank and forced rivals out into the first turn, had the rider take a hold at the three-sixteenths pole, dropped back off the
pace, moved to the inside, angled out on the far turn and came four wide into the stretch and little left while ridden out to the wire. THE SEVEN-EIGHTHS
FRACTION AND FINAL TIME WERE HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
EL DURANGO showed good early foot to take control from inside, took pressure into the turn, dueled with MISAWA into the stretch holding a short lead, got
brushed by that rival inside the three-sixteenths pole, continued to hold small advantage through the final furlong and kept the runner-up at bay. MISAWA
chased early then went up to press the pace nearing the turn, dueled around the bend and into the stretch, drifted in and brushed rival past the
three-sixteenths pole, drifted in again at the eight pole, battled down to the wire but could not get by. NO MALICE chased the top pair three then four wide
on the turn, could not summon the needed response in the drive but stayed on for a clear third. ICONIC STORM dropped back early and trailed well off the
inside, exited the turn six wide and passed tired rivals. MAUI ROAD broke well then dropped back off the pace, entered the turn two wide and exited the
bend five wide, angled out from behind rival but lacked room with a furlong to go, gained a clear path and failed to make an impact. EAGLES ANTHEM
broke slow from outside, went up to chase the speed outside a rival, raced four wide into the turn, six wide into the stretch and weakened. HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
VITTORIO moved off the rail and went three wide around the first turn, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, bid outside on the far turn, gained the lead
entering the stretch, relinquished control with three-sixteenths remaining, came back in the final sixteenth and inched ahead late. MARGOT'S BOY got
bumped on both sides leaving the gate, went four wide around the first turn, remained off the rail then closed in five wide leaving the second turn, launched
a bid from outside in upper stretch, took over past the three-sixteenths pole but faltered in the final sixteenth. SHOOTERS SHOOT traveled two wide then
moved to the rail on the first turn, stalked off the rail went two wide into the second bend, eased out further and closed in around the bend, put in a bid in
upper stretch, reached the front at the three-sixteenths pole, was overtaken soon after but stayed on between rivals to the wire. WILLY THE COBBLER
broke in and bumped rival leaving the gate, tucked inside on the first turn, saved ground to the stretch, improved placing in the stretch but never made an
impact. LUVLUV raced in the two path outside a rival on the first turn, angled to the rail on the second bend and was not a factor. NOTRE DAME broke out
and bumped rival at the start, sped clear and moved to the two path, challenged around the far turn, relinquished the lead into the stretch and gave way.

SATURDAY HEIST unhurried in the beginning, moved closer nearing the turn, bid four deep around the bend, led five wide into the lane, kicked clear in
upper stretch and drew away. SO VERY SMART chased outside the top pair, bid three deep on the turn, took over past the three-eighths pole, lost
command into the stretch, kept on while between rivals late and dug in for the place honors. MISS TOKYO chased off the rail then in the two path into the
turn, angled four wide leaving the bend, finished willingly three deep in the furlong grounds and gained the show. ROSES R BLUE dueled for the lead from
outside up the backstretch, vied between rivals around the turn, battled for the place honors in the final furlong but weakened late. ANATOLIA tracked along

Footnotes
UNTOUCHED ELEGANCE set the pace under pressure from inside, cleared into the turn, led two wide into the stretch, got tested again by LUNATIC at the
quarter pole, maintained a short advantage through the lane and edged away late. LUNATIC pressed the pace from inside, lost touched into the turn, angled
three wide around the bend, re-bid with a quarter mile remaining, kept the pressure on through the final furlong but faltered late. ZAHRA had her head
turned prior to the start then came away slow when the gates opened, trailed well off the inside into the turn, navigated the bend five wide and was along for
the show. DISCERNMENT broke a step slow in the beginning, tracked three deep into the turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked further response.
ROYAL BLEND chased on the inside into the turn, exited the bend two wide and weakened. MONGOLIAN BABY showed early speed inside a pair of rivals,
lost ground approaching the half-mile pole, dropped back around the turn, tired in the drive, eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
ME MACHO chased two then three wide around the first turn, launched a bid at the half-mile pole, took over at the seven-sixteenths marker, cleared
approaching the three-eighths, led clear into the furlong grounds and staved off the late bid from STRAUS'S PLACE in the final sixteenth. STRAUS'S
PLACE stalked along the inside, shifted out at the seven-sixteenths pole, came four wide into the stretch, chased within striking distance through the drive,
put in late bid was not enough to get by. INESPERADO got sandwiched at the start then steadied off heels soon after, went three wide around the first turn,
angled out on the far turn and exited the bend six wide, drifted inward in the lane and gained the show. MONGOL ALTAI took the first turn three wide, went
two then three wide on the second bend, kept on through the drive but needed more to make an impact. IRRESISTIBLY SEXY broke out and bumped
leaving the gate, chased three then four wide on the first turn, entered the stretch five wide and weakened. STORM THE GATE got bumped on both sides
leaving the gate, moved in from the three to the two path on the clubhouse turn, traveled a bit off the rail into the stretch and had little left for the drive.
MIZZEN POWER broke in and bumped rival, quickly cleared and moved into the two path on the first turn, challenged from outside at the half-mile pole, lost
command at the seven-sixteenths marker, dropped back on the far turn and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
EDA brushed the gate at the start, was forwardly placed three wide on the clubhouse turn, went up to take control at the nine-sixteenths pole, dueled into
and around the far turn, led clear into the lane, lost command midstretch but fought back gamely and dug in to prove best in the end. CAIRO MEMORIES
went four wide on the first turn, stalked the top pair outside a rival, took aim at the leader four wide leaving the second bend, continued to give chase down
the lane and put in a late bid to earn the place honors. TONITO'S went two then three wide around the first turn, stalked the top pair through the middle
stages, bid between in upper stretch, reached the front midstretch but faltered late and was overtaken by the top pair. DESERT DAWN traveled four then
five wide on the first turn, traveled widest up the backstretch, came four wide into the drive and never threatened. BENEDICT CANYON sped to the front
along the inside on the first turn, led under a hold early on the backstretch, dueled with EDA up the backstretch, battled around the second bend, chased
that foe into the stretch and weakened. GRACE ADLER went three wide around the first turn, chased two wide into the second bend, lost ground around the
second bend, tired in the lane, eased to the wire and walked off. THE MILE FRACTION AND FINAL TIME WERE HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
ARRABIATA got pinballed leaving the gate, lacked room trying to go between rivals at the half-mile pole, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied strongly
down the lane and inhaled the top pair in the final sixteenth. KING ROB lost his path at the start, chased two wide into the stretch, steered out in upper
stretch, rallied to the front approaching the final sixteenth but failed to put up any resistance when collared by the winner late. ABADON sped to the front
from inside, eased off the rail and led two to three wide into the stretch, inched away in upper stretch and showed the way clear to the eighth pole then
yielded in the final furlong. C J EXPRESS got bumped in the hind quarters leaving the gate, gave chase from off the rail, lost ground into the turn, saved
ground through the bend and could not rally while staying on for a minor award. TOASTED AT DAWN veered in and bumped rival at the start, got forced in
and steadied early, took the turn three then four wide and weakened. B D R BAXTER came in at the start, chased outside the leader up the backstretch,
started to climb and dropped back around the turn, exited the bend three wide and weakened. LOOKINFORMISCHIEF got pinballed at the start, lost his
path and checked early, went three wide into the turn, angled four to five wide leaving the bend and lacked further response. REAL POUCH broke slow from
the far outside, went up to chase the leader outside a rival, was closest in pursuit three wide into the stretch, drifted inward in the lane and weakened.
FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED TOASTED AT DAWN FROM FIFTH TO SEVENTH FOR VEERING IN AND FORCING
LOOKINFORMISCHIEF INTO ARRABIATA AT THE START, COSTING LOOKINFORMISCHIEF A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.
