Footnotes
HIAB AL ZAMAN was sent to the lead to set a pressured pace on the inside, was well handled throughout, then came off the inside in the stretch and kept
QUICK SAND AA safe to the wire to prove best under a drive. QUICK SAND AA was rated along nicely on the inside to the quarter pole, then came off the
inside to have aim on the pace setter, but could not gain late on that rival while being clearly second best. PADDYS DAY tracked the pace on the
backstretch three to four wide, then was between rivals leaving the three eighths, then came four wide into the drive but had no kick in the drive, bested rest.
LIKE MOULIN ROUGE pressed the pace three wide and weakened the final quarter of a mile. MADJIKMAN tracked the early pace and made a five wide
middle move to force the pace by the half mile marker and then tired on the turn. RB BLYTZ failed to respond.

Footnotes
UPTOWN SANDY GIRL set the pace while unchallenged and on the inside, then drew out on the turn and widened the margin leaving the turn, then was
tiring late and lasted while being all out. IRIDESSE was reserved early on the inside, then moved to the outside and advanced four wide on the turn, closed
the gap fast late to just miss. WMA BIG BABY was four wide into the first turn, then chased the pace and made a early bid four wide to stalk the pace on the
backstretch, dropped down to the inside on the turn and weakened, lasted for the show award. UPTOWN LADY ARABELLA was rated along the inside and
then angled off the inside by the furlong marker but had no rally. CONSIDER THESS passed the tiring rivals. RB LARA stalked the pace three wide and
weakened. DANCE WITH ME BW was settled three to four wide and tired. RB GAIM CHANGER was through early, then was distanced and walked off. The
seven furlong split was unavailable due to a timer malfunction

Footnotes
BOOMIN WITH EAGLES all out, brushed, held on for win. CAPA ROYALE broke in, bumped, drifted out, bumped, menaced, game 2nd. TORTS ON A
WAGON rallied, closed outside. SWEET CALI GIRL closed belatedly. SEPARATING THE DASHS brushed, brief bid, stopped. DAME OF THRONES
brushed, evenly mid track. ATTA BOY BOK bid, too much too late. DASH N TO THE CARTEL flat. JET DOT COM bid, faded. MS GUERRA hesitated,
break, never a factor. The trainer of CAPA ROYALE claimed OBJECTION against BOOMIN WITH EAGLES for alleged interference following the start, but
after review there was NO CHANGE in the order of finished.
