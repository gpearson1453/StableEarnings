Footnotes
TWIXY CAT raced close up between rivals, stalked the pace, tracked between foes on the turn, rallied between horses, surged to the front and edged away
for the win. SOCIAL EQUALITY stumbled at the start, raced off the pace, moved up on the turn, came five wide into the lane and rallied outside for second.
SOUTHSIDE SWIG vied outside for the lead, dueled into the stretch and dug in to save the show spot. AMERICAN FLEET raced off the pace inside, angled
out entering the stretch and gained mildly. MR. WALSH chased outside, moved up on the turn, came six wide into the lane and gained mildly outside. RUN
FAST stalked outside, chased three wide on the turn and tired. RISING STORM was off a bit slow, moved up inside, made a rail bid entering the turn,
dueled and weakened. WICKED STRONG ALEX raced off the rail, off the pace, steadied at the half mile marker and did not factor. ELITE MISSION vied
inside for the lead, then chased and faded.

Footnotes
SUCCESSFUL LEGACY angled inside setting the pace, widened in the stretch while kept to a drive. ABSOLUTE ANNA pursued three wide, faded briefly on
the final turn then came again for the place. GINGERS WISH stalked the winner to the stretch then came up empty. AMERICAN MONEY was reserved at
the back of the pack then passed rivals without menacing. COOPER PENNY angled inside with a brief advance on the final turn then faltered.
DREAMINOFDASIES saved ground off the pace and weakened steadily. MON CHERIE squeezed just after the start, chased wide and faltered.

CATCH FIRE prompted the pace outside, bid on the turn, led in midstretch and held on driving. STAR LUCK set a pressured pace in the two path to the
stretch and held on gamely. STRAWBERRY RED flashed speed inside then weakened slightly in the stretch. CIGAR BOX angled inside down the
backstretch and continued well without threatening. PHARAOH'S CITY swung very wide to secure room on the turn and rallied. GOLDENLINEOF chased
between rivals early and faded. KOWBOY KARMA broke very slowly then caught fading rivals. FARA'S KID chased in midpack, moved inside on the turn
and was no factor. DOUGIE chased outside and weakened. GRAN CAUSEWAY broke sluggishly and was never in contention. AMBLIN MAN pressed the
pace outside early then proved empty in the stretch. IRONBOUND saved ground and stopped abruptly.

SPIRIT WOLF stalked close up two wide, then pressed the pace, bid three wide entering the far turn, dueled, led into the stretch and drew clear under
urging. SPARTAK reluctant to load, raced two wide off the pace, advanced on the far turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied late outside and was up for
second in the final strides. DONT BREAK THE LAW veered in at the break, pulled and was steadied early on, advanced on the far turn, came three wide
into the lane, rallied mildly and was outfinished late for the place spot. ALONZO MOSELY set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn and weakened.
JUDICIAL RESTRAINT raced off the pace, chased inside on the far turn and lacked a rally. PREFONTAINE was reluctant to load, raced off the pace inside,
asked for run nearing the far turn and lacked a rally. BEST START tracked close up on the inside, made a rail bid entering the far turn, was shuffled back
and tired. BREW DOG was outrun inside.
