OUR LUCKY MAN rated outside, bid inside in the stretch and outfinished pair of rivals after a long drive. ARTISTIC REASON well placed behind the dueling
leaders, angled out in the stretch and continued gamely. ROAD TO SUCCESS prompted the pace outside, took over at the quarter pole but was outfinished.
TATE trailed for half a mile, moved very wide on the final turn and into stretch rallying. STRIKING A POSE lacked speed outside then went evenly through
the stretch. PYLON set a clear pace inside, vied through the final turn and weakened. GRAZELY flashed speed inside then stopped abruptly.

off the leaders, angled out in the stretch and continued gamely for the place. IMPERIAL ROAD quickly moved clear inside, was collared midway on the turn
and faltered. LATE TO THE SHOW saved ground early, moved wide in the stretch rallying too late. TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT dropped back inside and was
never a factor. BET ON GRET trailed racing wide and was never in contention. KINDA CLASS'Y raced within range in the two path and gave way.

JUST A THOUGHT led inside, moved clear before half a mile and widened his advantage under mild pressure. ENRAGED pressed the winner to the stretch
and faltered while holding on for the place. BUCKS ARE MOVING rated very wide down the backstretch, faded on the turn then came again. CLEMENZA
urged close up three wide, moved extremely wide on the turn and came up empty in the stretch. SAILOR AGAIN trailed early, steadied at the top of the
stretch while no factor. JOHNNY OIL saved ground off the pace, moved briefly closer into the far turn then faltered. A claim of foul by the fifth finisher
against the third finisher for interference at the top of the stretch was denied.

Footnotes
STARSHIP LAOBAN stalked pace, took over easily midway turn, quickly drew away. DECISIVE CAUSE jumped shadow early causing her rider to lose his
right iron then rallied well to earn the place. SHE'S A FAST ONE led inside to midway on the turn, was collared and faltered. STARSHIP CHARLY trailed
early inside and passed several rivals. OUTWORKABLE raced in midpack and lacked a response. SEIZE THE WHISKEY saved ground off the leaders and
weakened steadily. CALIENTE RUM stopped on the turn and was never a factor. BETTER BELIEVE IT saved ground early and began fading on the turn.

WAGON BOSS reserved behind the dueling leaders, angled wide in the stretch and pulled away while geared down late. JUPI'S LIGHTNING earned a
narrow advantage inside and continued gamely for the place. COLOUR GUARD prompted the pace outside then weakened in the stretch. BOAT OVER
THE HILL broke slowly and dropped far behind, advanced inside in the stretch. DISCO'S BRIDGE saved ground within striking range and faltered. JONES
TAXI lacked speed racing wide and was always outrun. SILVER FURY forced the pace three wide for five furlongs and stopped.

EGOT A POKER FACE wide early, moved clear inside before half a mile and edged away while kept to his task. AGELESS ENDEAVOR inside early,
pursued the winner and continued well for the place. ICY COLD dueled between rivals early, was asked for run on the final turn but tired. UNDERCOVER
KITTY broke slowly then gained inside through the stretch without menacing. MARGIN OF AIR was fanned very wide on the first turn, remained wide and
tired. BOBBYSFRIENDPOPEYE chased inside and began fading on the final turn. DEPLANE broke sluggishly and was never in contention. BENCH
PRESS dropped back inside and was always outrun. LEA'S ROAD stopped abruptly losing contact with his field.
