Footnotes
SAULS CALL set the pace outside a rival then cleared nearing the turn, led two wide around the bend then came three wide into the stretch and drew off
under some right-handed encouragement and strong handling. IM STILL THIRSTY got brushed from outside and put in tight quarters early, went two wide
into the turn, came out around the bend and entered the stretch five wide, rallied and gained the place. MR. T'S THIRSTY pressed the pace from inside,
chased the leader around the turn and flattened to third. HAY JUAN got floated in and brushed inner rival early, chased under coaxing three wide then came
four wide into the drive and weakened. PRINCE HUSSAR lost his path early, went three wide into the turn, five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
SOUL SWEET contested the pace early inside a pair of rivals, could not keep up leaving the backstretch, chased two then three wide around the bend,
closed inside SWEET SONNY in the final furlong got up late. SWEET SONNY vied for the lead between rivals early then dueled inside a rival in the two
path into the turn, cleared rival past the three-eighths pole, showed the way three wide into the stretch, held a diminishing lead approaching the sixteenth
pole and was overtaken late. WARREN'S MEMORABLE dropped back early from outside, went three wide into the turn, angled six wide into the stretch and
outclosed JAMMINJL for the show. JAMMINJL chased along the inside to the turn, went two to three wide into the stretch and got outkicked for the show.
BIG AL'S PRINCESS chased off the rail, exited the bend four wide and needed to find more in the final furlong. RUTHIES RACER tracked the early leaders
off the inside, angled to the rail for the turn, saved ground into the lane and lacked a rally. FLATTERWITHJEWELS vied outside a pair of rivals then dueled
into the turn, pressed to the three-eighths pole then lost contact with the leader, chased four wide into the stretch and weakened. MY TIGRESS was
forwardly placed well off the rail, went four wide into the turn, five wide into the stretch and tired while drifting to the inside.

SURELY SPECTACULAR hopped at the start but recovered quickly, tracked the pace three wide into the turn, moved out and came five wide into the
stretch, rallied through the lane and surged late three deep to prove best in the end. NEVER SWAY turned her head then got bothered from outside at the
start, chased along the inside through the turn, rallied up the inside but was outclosed by the winner. MAKARA sent for the lead, dueled outside SAI PHAR
early then cleared past the nine-sixteenths pole, showed the way two wide then three wide into the stretch, weakened late and was run down by the top pair
in the closing moments. SAI PHAR away quickly and dueled early inside a rival then ceded command at the nine-sixteenths pole, chased three then four
wide around the turn and never produced a bid. RYANO ROSE off a bit slow to begin, sat off the pace from inside, entered the stretch two wide and lacked
the needed response. A. P. SQUARED trailed four then three wide on the turn and never got invovled.

Footnotes
RED PANTY NIGHT sped to the front from inside, led three wide while being challenged into the stretch, fought with that rival to the three-sixteenths pole,
then kicked clear and drew away. CHAO MAR tracked along the inside then two wide into the lane, moved out in the stretch, split foes with a sixteenth
remaining and surged late to gain the place. RATTRAPANTE tracked off the inside then angled in nearing the turn, bid inside the lead leaving the bend,
challenged in upper stretch then could not match strides with three-sixteenths left to run and got edged for the place honors in the closing moments.
DORITA'S HAPPY shifted in at the start, went four to five wide around the turn, summoned a mild rally and earned a minor award. GOLDEN HALO broke
out and bumped rival in the beginning, sat off the pace, went four wide into the drive and failed to threaten. CAT LADY BLUES got impeded when
DORITA'S HAPPY shifted in at the start and had to steady, raced well off the rail then angled in on the turn, moved back out in the stretch but lacked the
needed late kick. ROSES FOR MARILYN came away slow and got bumped leaving the gate, trailed on the inside into the stretch and failed to menace.
QUIET FOREST raced up close early outside the pacesetter, chased that rival three then four wide around the turn and faded. SPEEDY LOU C stalked off
rail and entered the stretch three wide, tired in the drive, bled following the race and walked off. MISTAKA broke well then dropped back off the pace, went
two wide into the turn, eased out and came six wide into the stretch and came up empty.

UNCLE FRED vied for command inside a pair of rivals, exited the turn two wide, battled with outside pair down the stretch under left-handed urging and
would not be denied. SUZIE QZZ BROTHER vied three deep into and around the turn, came five wide into the stretch, fought gamely from outside and dug
in late to share the victory. SQUARE CAT vied between into and around the bend, battled between the same pair of foes through the stretch and shortened
a bit in the final sixteenth but still proved a game third. LEMON SUSHI tracked off the rail, went four wide into the turn, angled down to the rail then steered
back out leaving the bend, angled out widest in the drive and was gaining on the top trio to the wire. STING LIKE A BEE chased three to four wide around
the turn and tired in the stretch.

FATHER O'FLAHERTY lost his path at the start, settled off the rail, swung five wide leaving the turn, closed from outside and reached the top pair with a
furlong to go and drove clear. OLDER BROTHER dueled for the lead form inside, held a narrow lead with an eight of a mile remaining, was overtaken
shortly after and managed to save the place. TACOFLAVOREDKISSES settled early on the inside, remained next the rail to the stretch, rallied up the fence
and missed the place. BIG CHEDDAR dueled for command from outside to the stretch, battled into the furlong grounds but faltered late. UNTHROTTLED
chased off the rail, three wide into the stretch and finished evenly in the furlong grounds. FUN COUPONS chased the top pair from outside, went three wide
into the turn, exited the bend four wide and failed to respond when called upon. KIDMON tossed his head and came away slow, saved ground along the
inside and was not a factor. JUST LIKE FRED forwardly placed in the early stages, went four wide into the turn, moved down to the three path around the
bend, angled back out and entered the stretch five wide, drifted in while tiring and was eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
ROSE DAWSON tracked the early speed battle off the rail, bid four deep around the turn, took over with three-sixteenths remaining and drew away under
hand urging. INCREASE STAKES coaxed early from the gate, showed speed five deep then dueled outside a rival into the turn, vied between foes around
the bend, lost the lead in upper stretch but kept to task to finish a clear second. SWANNING displayed early foot between rivals and got crowded past the
nine-sixteenths pole, dropped back to chase and went three around the turn, angled out into the stretch and rallied to earn the show. FINGER TIP raced up
close from the far outside, bid three deep around the turn, battled between foes to midstretch and flattened out. ROMAN EMPRESS showed early speed
between rivals, dueled inside a rival into the turn, vied along the rail through the bend and weakened. LADY SASSAFRAS vied three deep between rivals
early, was crowded a bit past the nine-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into the turn, moved to the rail around the bend, exited the turn two wide and
weakened. TRIPDOWNMEMORYLANE broke inward at the start, showed early speed from inside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, trailed along the
rail into the drive and had little left for the late stages. FUNNY FELINE came away to a slow beginning, went four deep into the turn, five wide into the
stretch, then tired while drifting inward in the lane.

Footnotes
AS TIME GOES BY pressed the pace early from inside on the clubhouse turn, lost contact at the three-quarter pole then applied pressure again, moved up
to take control at the nine-sixteenths pole, cleared briefly leaving the backstretch, got tested by STELLAR SOUND on the far turn, shook free leaving the
bend, was overtaken by WARREN'S SHOWTIME past the three-sixteenths pole, fought back from inside and regained the lead with a furlong remaining and
drew clear late. WARREN'S SHOWTIME settled off the pace, went three wide into the second bend, closed in while easing out around the turn, entered the
stretch five wide, drew alongside AS TIME GOES BY and took a short lead past the three-sixteenths pole, lost the lead with a furlong to go and faltered in
the final sixteenth. MOONLIGHT D'ORO broke a step slow from outside, wen three to four wide on the first turn, tracked four wide into the second bend,
came five wide into the stretch, drifted inward in the drive and was along for the show. STELLAR SOUND off a bit slow to begin, tracked the speed from off
the rail, moved up outside the top trio in the middle stages, bid alongside AS TIME GOES BY on the far turn but could not go on with that rival leaving the
turn and weakened down the lane. HARVEST MOON came away quickly to take the lead, was pressured on the first turn from inside, cleared at the
three-quarter pole then got pressured again early on the backstretch, relinquished control at the nine-sixteenths pole, dropped back around the far turn and
faded in the lane. BYE BYE BERTIE chased the top pair three wide around the first turn, put in a bid three deep at the nine-sixteenths pole, could not
sustain the bid leaving the backstretch, chased three wide into the lane and tired.
