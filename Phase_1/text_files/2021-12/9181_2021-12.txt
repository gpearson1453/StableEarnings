Footnotes
PACIFIC LEGEND stayed close inside for a half-mile, got steered off the rail approaching the eighth-pole, rallied to catch the leaders from outside with a
sixteenth remaining and drove clear. ADIOS SENOR sprinted clear early and moved inside, responded when hooked by NUREYEV'S DREAM coming to
the quarter-pole, dug in along the rail through the stretch and stayed on well for the place. FULL SEND narrowed the gap on ADIOS SENOR from outside
after a quarter-mile, got out-moved around the turn, shifted further out into the stretch and was coming back on again late. NUREYEV'S DREAM broke a
step slowly, lacked room behind horses and steadied up the backstretch, found daylight and went up after ADIOS SENOR around the turn, poked a head in
front after a half, then weakened between horses leaving the furlong grounds. ONLYAMATTEROFTIME dropped back around the turn inside, and had
nothing more. SO FAKE SO PHONY broke behind the field by a couple lengths, and was through early outside.

Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE LADY led the way under a hold while saving ground around the first turn, continued to show the way from the rail up the backstretch and
around the far turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and was hand ridden out to the wire. FAST AS FLIGHT chased the frontrunner from the two path
around the first turn and up the backstretch, began an outside bid approaching the three eighths pole, could not go with the winner in the stretch and chased
that rival home, the best of the rest. PHARAOH'S JEWEL raced in tight quarters while saving ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in
the middle of the pack on the inside, began to improve position while racing in the two path around the turn, and continued to gain ground between horses
down the lane, while proving to be no match for the top two. MARIA'S REVENGE raced off the pace in the two path through the opening half mile, angled in
to save ground around the far turn and gained ground on the outside in late stretch. VENTRILOQUIST saved ground around the first turn, chased the
leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, offered an inside bid nearing the quarter pole and weakened in the
final strides. COCOA ICING hopped up leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the
outside, navigated the far turn from the two path and faded in the stretch. GREAT WARRIOR (IRE) hit the gate hard enough to throw her rider off balance at
the start, recovered to race in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the far turn
and was empty from there. FLEETING GLIMPSE raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the
outside, navigated the far turn from the two path and came up empty in the stretch. TRANQUILLINA raced in the four path at the back of the pack around
the first turn and up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and made no bid. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE. THIS RACE WAS HAND
TIMED, FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
BABY LION took over inside QUEEN DOMINA after the opening quarter-mile, extended the advantage through the middle fractions, and faced no
challenges through the stretch while drifting out steadily under pressure. VICTORY CRUSADE saved ground around the turn, rallied into second
approaching the stretch, stayed on her left lead and was no threat to the winner. TIME TO TWO STEP raced evenly in the two-path, and ran on well clear of
the remainder. QUEEN DOMINA banged into the right side of the gate breaking outward, led out of the chute before relinquishing command, stayed on the
chase to the turn, drifted six or seven wide past the quarter-pole and tired. LOVIN LIVIN was outrun toward the inside. TRULY was finished early three wide.
GYPSY WIFE retired early inside.

Footnotes
CAPTURINI hopped at the start, stalked the pace in the four path, rallied between foes and was up in final strides. SHE'S CLASSY set a pressured pace in
the two path, was headed in upper stretch, fought back inside and led until the final strides. BROADWAY PEGGY pressed the pace in the three path, took a
short lead near the quarter pole, vied between foes through the stretch and was outfinished. QUEEN CALYPSO hit the starting gate, raced five wide around
the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and rallied widest. FILLMORE EAST steadied early, angled five wide nearing the turn, stayed wide throughout
and rallied belatedly. MY BEAUTY PRINCESS saved ground to no avail. SISTER IS DEVIL failed to menace while racing four wide. GREGS POSSE
steadied along between foes through the opening quarter, raced two and three wide around the turn and lacked a closing bid. MISS LAMARR saved ground
around the turn, angled out in upper stretch and was outrun. CIDSTAYINURLAINE had early speed between foes, checked nearing the turn, raced two wide
around the bend and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
CYBERVIKING pressed the pace between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, dueled from the two path around the turn, kicked clear entering the
stretch and just held off a late closer to the wire while drifting in mildly in the final furlong. CONCRETE GLORY chased the frontrunning set on the inside up
the backstretch, began to improve position while saving ground around the turn, and gained ground steadily on the outside down the lane, just missing the
win. JUST LEO dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, gave way with a furlong to go and finished evenly, the best of the
rest. RHYMES LIKE DIMES bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leaders between horses in the early going,
dropped back to trail the field while saving ground around the turn, swung wide into the stretch and gained ground mildly late. I'LL FINISH hit the gate
leaving it, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, raced in three path around the turn, couldn't go with the leaders entering the stretch and
faded down the lane. WOW RUN chased the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, dropped back to race off the pace in the two path
around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and was empty from there. ACT OF VALOR bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate,
recovered to duel for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and continued to tire in the stretch.

Footnotes
LIAM set the pace in the two-path while hounded from outside by CREATE AGAIN for six furlongs, turned that rival away under pressure coming to the
eighth-pole, drifted out while drawing away and was geared down the last sixteenth of a mile. CREATE AGAIN pressed LIAM from outside, could not match
strides by upper stretch, but ran on clearly best of the others. LITTLE DEMON raced between horses in range around the turn two to three wide, and kept
on evenly through the lane unthreatened for third. NIXON JOY (ARG) was outrun three to four wide to the top of the stretch, and improved on the far outside
for the last major share. MENELIK stayed close early inside under a firm hold, and came up empty when asked on the turn. GUMP stumbled at the start and
was last away, and never factored. HERCULES became edgy in the gate prior to the start, bumped with MAGIC ECLIPSE just after the break, and tired
after six furlongs outside. MAGIC ECLIPSE bumped with HERCULES a stride or two from the gate, and showed little at the rear.

Footnotes
LIKE WHAT I SEE set the pace along the rail and held clear under a drive. KASIM tracked the pace three wide, could not gain on the winner in the stretch
and just lasted for the place. COOP TRIES HARDER was in range inside, angled three wide turning for home, finished willingly and just missed second.
CABLE CHANNEL chased the pace two wide, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. THING prompted the winner two wide and weakened
in the lane. DR. DUKE slammed into the starting gate nearly unseating the rider, raced four wide and made little impact. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE. THIS
RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
AMERICAN NINJA trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, switched to the outside entering the far turn, launched a
bid four wide nearing the quarter pole, quickly took command and drew off down the lane. GEMONTEER raced in the three and four path around the first
turn, pressed the pace from the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and chased the winner home, holding off a late
closer for second. CAPTAIN THUNDER navigated the first turn from the three path, raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch,
began to improve position while saving ground around the turn and continued to gain ground on the outside in late stretch. MR MATUSCHEK raced in the
three and four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began a bid from the two path passing the
three eighths pole, and was outkicked in the final furlong. GRACEFUL KITTEN chased the leaders from the two path around the first turn, continued to track
them on the inside for the run up the backstretch, made a mild improvement of position while racing in the two path coming off the turn and flattened out in
the stretch. ROBINTAKINCHARGE hit the gate while breaking sharply, led the field while racing on the rail around the first turn and up the backstretch,
began to drop back while saving ground around the far turn and continued to tire from there. POINTER raced in tight quarters headed into the first turn,
saved ground while racing off the pace from there, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, swung wide
entering the stretch and made no bid while drifting out down the lane.
