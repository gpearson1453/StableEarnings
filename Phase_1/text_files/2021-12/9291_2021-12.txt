CARRY ON unhurried early advanced into the far turn looming outside the leader in upper stretch angling out to the six path needing full extension to get by.
LIMONATA away alertly set the pace holding daylight through the far turn, digging in near the rail in upper stretch fought back under outside pressure
angling out ceding grudgingly in the last yards. MALIBU MARLEE saved ground angling out into the far turn losing ground to upper stretch vying seven wide
hanging in the late going. CLEARLY VISIBLE stalked the pace laying close through the far turn extending in the three path upper stretch weakening under a
drive. STYLISH ASH hustled along chased to the far turn wavering there fading into upper stretch. SHOWSTOMPER raced evenly in mick pack, would
check up racing between horses near the three eighths pole. LYRICIST was never involved. WEST BURKE tracked the pace chasing through the far turn
before giving way abruptly in upper stretch. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF SHOWSTOPPER AGAINST THE RIDERS OF MALIBU MARLEE AND
CARRY ON FOR INTERFERENCE NEARING THE THREE EIGHTHS POLE WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
DYNAMIC REACH gave an inside move to grab the lead on the turn, shook clear in upper stretch widening to the wire. WESTERN HOPE slow early gave a
mild rally on the turn losing ground to upper stretch finishing evenly in the six path as second best. CARSON'S ROCKET slow early cut the corner to upper
stretch gaining position there along the rail. BRILLIANTBENNY reluctant to load was a step slow throughout racing six wide down the lane. DANCE MOVES
propped steadying at the break. FAMILY JET slow early gave a modest move to upper stretch leveling off late. ADMIRAL GLEN pressed the pace dueling
through the turn wearing out the final eighth. REACHING FOR GOLD flashed early speed, then faded on the turn.

Footnotes
GOLDEN TEMPLE off slowly fired on the turn bidding three deep in upper stretch showing full of run to win going away. ILLUSIONS OF LOVE pressed the
pace dueling abreast rival to upper stretch being overpowered tightening rival on the rail to save place. MAVI pressed the pace dueling through the turn
being tightened up along the rail down the lane. BIRDIE BLUE chased early then dropped off on the turn. BLUE ROCKETTE raced second flight playing no
factor. WISH FOR MAGIC was never involved. FRANKIE'S GIFT was always outrun. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF MAVI AGAINST THE RIDER
OF ILLUSIONS OF LOVE FOR INTERFERENCE DOWN THE LANE WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.
