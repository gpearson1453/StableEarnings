wide while asked near the five-sixteenths, was driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and got up for the place. DARIO'S ANGEL
chased the early pace, moved up with five furlongs to run to dispute the lead, vied along the rail on the turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and
weakened then lost the place but was clear for the show. BEYOND THE HYPE contested the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, battled
under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. MISS PAB bumped with a foe at the start then dropped back, went four wide on

Footnotes
KAREN'S COVE set the clear pace, extended the advantage in the two path on the turn, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole, remained on his
inside lead under the crop to the wire and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. HEALY'S HOPE bumped with a foe at the start, dropped well
behind the rest of the field, traveled around the turn in the two path and finished with good energy for the place. E J'S REVENGE was hustled from the start,
chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn and weakened but just held the show. CAUSE OF ACTION angled in while off the pace, settled
under some urging, went three wide for most of the turn then moved to four wide, came five wide into the stretch under a drive and gained to just miss the
show. TALE OF MIST bumped with an opponent at the start then was taken up with a snatch of the left rein, moved out towards the rear, went five wide on
the turn, came six wide into the stretch and gained some ground but was no factor. TRAPPEZE ARTIST was urged early then settled off the pace, raced
inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, shifted three wide outside the quarter-pole then was driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed response. R BOY BODE chased the pace on the inside of a rival, moved in outside the half-mile pole then dropped back, saved ground on the turn
and capitulated. SKYLER'S SCRAMJET was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

ROOSKI lost her footing at the start but broke towards the front, chased the pace on the outside, went around the turn in the two path, was driven three wide
into the stretch, chased the runner-up into the final furlong, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. LADY
MILAGRO bumped hard with a rival at the start, recovered well to show the way down the backstretch, extended the advantage near the rail on the turn,
came under a drive in upper stretch, was challenged by the winner inside the furlong marker, fought on well with that foe to the wire and just missed while
clear for the place. SARATOGA KISSES settled under some urging, traveled around the turn in mostly the two path, moved out under a drive in upper
stretch and got up for the show. KINGDOM QUEEN was hustled from the start then urged along towards the front, dropped in late on the backstretch, saved
ground on the turn, came off the rail under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. SLOW CROSSING was urged along on the outside, went
three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. LUZ broke out and bumped hard with a rival, went three
then two wide on the turn and was no factor. ROYALLY BLUE was urged along while chasing the pace, dropped back three wide on the turn, spun five wide
into the stretch and retreated. OUR TINY DANCER was urged along off the pace, raced inside for most of the turn then shifted three wide and failed to
respond. NO MORE MISCHIEF was bumped hard on both sides at the start then taken up while pinched back, moved from the two path to the four path
under urging on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and also failed to respond.

prevailed under strong urging. FIRING CAROL brushed with a foe midway down the backstretch while urged along on the outside, went five wide on the
turn, chased under a drive while still on her inside lead into the final sixteenth, swapped to the proper lead late and finished willingly for the place. MADERA
set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead near the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and
weakened but determinedly earned the show. BASTET pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took a brief lead near the
three-sixteenths then was headed by the winner, dropped back into the final furlong and tired then just missed the show. JADES GELLY broke a step slow,
was urged along off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn and failed to respond. HAPPY SOPHIA settled off the pace, brushed
with a foe midway down the backstretch, went three then two wide on the turn, drifted out around the furlong marker and came up empty. FIGHT ON LUCY

the needed response. OUCH OUCH OUCH broke in and bumped with a foe, settled off the pace, angled in near the three-quarter pole, moved from three to
