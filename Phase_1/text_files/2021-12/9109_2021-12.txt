JUSTKISSMYGRITS vied for the early lead and made a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole3, shook clear leaving the turn then held on late under steady
left handed crop urging. SILVER LOCKS was rated along early, made a three wide move on the turn to move into contention, continued that bid to be
gaining late to just miss. VANQUISHER was off four lengths last, then advanced on the inside, angled out for racing room by the three sixteenths, then
finally got clear leaving the furlong marker and rallied but too late. TIP TOP TAPPER vied for the early lead and made a inside bid on the turn to go on even
terms but weakened. KATESALUCKYGIRL stalked the early pace three to four wide and came up empty in the drive. FRED'S SHEILA was allowed to settle
early, came three wide into the drive and had no rally.

Footnotes
POWWA OF LOVE was allowed to settle early, eased off the inside on the turn, then eased out side of ARCHER'S HALL to make a five wide bid leaving the
quarter pole while in hand, then drew off in the furlong grounds after two left handed pops with the riding crop. ARCHER'S HALL stalked the early pace and
made a three to four wide bid to take over by the quarter pole, then could not go with the winner while clearly second best. TAK E LADY was allowed to
settle early, came four wide into the drive and offered no rally while besting the rest. WINDY GLO SAL set the pace two to three wide and weakened.
PRIME COAT lacked a rally. REGAL JORDAN pressed the early pace on the inside and weakened. SAW was through early.

O K GAME ON was rated along and made a four wide bid by the quarter pole, then had a long drive with HOT N SPICY LOVE and got by that rival at the
wire to just get up under a drive. HOT N SPICY LOVE prompted the pace and made a three wide bid to take over on the turn, then had a long drive with the
winner and was denied late to just miss. RON DON SCORESE was allowed to settle early, advanced four wide on the turn, shifted in by the quarter pole
and rallied well on the inside late. WAHOOWA WAHOOWA chased the early pace three wide, then was on the inside on the far turn and weakened.
WILLING TO SPEED was reserved early while three wide, then lacked a rally. BUILT THAT WAY set the pace on the inside and gave way. ECLIPSED
MOON had no response.

PERFECT DAY stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, drew off smartly in the stretch to prove much the best under steady urging.
RISEN SAVIOR was allowed to settle early, then advanced four wide by the quarter pole, then finished willingly to gain the place award. BALTIMORE
BULLEIT chased the pace four wide and faded while lasting for the show award. NIMITZ CLASS was reserved early on the inside, eased off the inside on
the turn, swung out six wide for the drive and had a belated rally. NICE WEATHER set the pace in the two path and weakened. SASSY LAD was well
placed early on the inside and weakened. DRAGON BALLET chased the pace three wide and weakened. MICRO STAR was allowed to settle four wide and
lacked a rally. FATHEROFTHEBRIDES failed to menace. ORASHI was not a factor.

Footnotes
BREEZE BURNER was well placed throughout saving ground, then started to shift off the rail leaving the quarter pole, then decided not and shifted back
inside, rallied inside to prevail late under a drive. THREETHEHARDWAY was rated along and made a four wide bid on the turn, gained a short advantage
leaaving the turn and was caught late. BOYS OF QUEENS was settled back early, came eight wide into the drive and closed well late. PAL CAL vied for the
lead two wide and made a bid on the backstretch, then continued on the pace to the three sixteenths and faded late. AGAINST THE ODDS was five wide
into the first turn, settled five to four wide on the backstretch, came six wide into the drive but had no kick. SURFER BOY GEORGE was void of early speed,
then advanced three wide on the turn but lacked a rally. CATTLE DRIVE vied for the lead three wide and weakened. HIT THE TICKET chased the early
pace in between horses and stopped, eased to the wire and walked off.

drive to prove much the best under mild urging. MARC WELLS was reserved early, eased out leaving the quarter pole and came five wide into the drive and
rallied well on the outside to gain the place award. MR. SHENANIGANS set the early pace while clear, then was headed nearing the quarter pole and
weakened, lasted the for the show award. GOLD FELLOW was allowed to settle early on the inside, swung out four wide for the drive but had no kick. DON
TATTO chased the pace five wide and weakened. MARADONA tracked the pace on the inside and weakened. FLAHERTY was four wide into the first turn,
then settled three to four wide and had no response. MISTER ARANGUIZ chased the pace four wide and tired.
