Footnotes
HOW LUCKY stalked the pace in the two path on the turn, eased out to the four path at the head of the stretch, swept to command in upper stretch, was
under brisk urging and pulled away. HOME BY SEVEN lacked speed, raced in the two path leaving the turn and rallied inside horses. GOT A GOOD
REASON showed speed, saved ground on the turn, weakened and drifted out inside the eighth pole. LIKEHAIL showed speed between horses to upper
stretch and weakened. UNION BETTY , fanned to the five path entering the stretch, failed to rally. SAINT RITA , three deep on the turn, loomed entering the
stretch, raced on her left lead and gave way. CELESTIAL DIVA raced in mid pack and lacked a rally. WILLOW'S CHARM , wide on the turn, was fanned six
deep turning for home and gave way. ICY HARBOR was not a factor. MONKEY ON MY BACK showed speed along the rail, faltered on the turn and was
eased. DIADORA , outrun, was eased.

Footnotes
MINER'S GEM broke alertly, disputed the pace outside ALWAYS SOMETHING, was roused clear of that rival approaching the stretch, drifted out briefly
then was corrected with right handed encouragement, opened up under a drive in mid stretch and was kept alert to the finish. LITTLE MS SCARLET chased
the dueling leaders while off the inside, shifted four wide into the stretch, churned on willingly but was no match for the winner. ALWAYS SOMETHING
advanced inside to a slim lead after a furlong, dueled inside the winner to about the quarter pole, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded late. LAUGHIN'
PLACE , sluggish from the gate, was urged three wide into the stretch and failed to menace. LIVE AID chased while saving ground, eased back from inside
rivals nearing the turn, angled out but failed to generate a kick. SICK PACK SARA , very reluctant to load, broke outward, straightened and edged up three
deep to attend the pace, had no response approaching the stretch and tired. PER RULING #22-042 FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION,
MINER'S GEM WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
UNCAPTURED SPIRIT sped to the lead mid way down the backstretch, set the pace in the two path around the turn then eagerly drew away while kept to
his business. CODIGO , four wide entering the turn, moved to the two path turning for home and offered a mild move inside horses. SUNDAY MISCHIEF ,
along the inner rail chasing the winner around the turn, angled out in upper stretch and faded. WHIZWIT , three wide on the turn, was fanned five deep in
upper stretch and was never a factor. SAGRADA RAY , caught in close quarters at the start, saved ground on the turn, was taken to the four path between
horses in upper stretch and failed to menace. GOOD TIP raced along the inner rail on the turn while outrun. MOCEPHUS , three wide chasing the pace
around the turn, gave way. DIVINING DANCER trailed.

Footnotes
SHERIFF CHIP broke a step slow, quickly recovered and edged up towards the inside, was nicely rated off of a three pronged battled past the five eighths,
eased out leaving the far turn, swept four wide to engage the leaders nearing the quarter pole, took a short lead in upper stretch, tussled outside
CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO past the eighth pole, disposed of that one inside the sixteenth marker and drove clear. CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO , three and
two wide between rivals disputing the pace, put a head in front after a half mile, clung to a short lead while joined by the winner past the quarter pole, fought
on to the inside of that one in mid stretch, gave way grudgingly and was well clear of the rest in a sharp try. DESHACKLED had speed two wide to the inside
of foes and contested the pace, dropped to the rail into the turn, stayed close to upper stretch, faded in the final furlong but did salvage the show.
DISPUTED NOTION , taken to rate early, dropped in and advanced towards the rail near the five sixteenths, shifted out four wide to have aim into the lane
but flattened out through the final eighth. SPEIGHTSTER RED , four wide early, drafted in around the turn, remained inside in the drive but failed to
threaten. FRANCIS X. , five wide early, pursued four wide mid turn but came up empty. ICE RAIN lagged off the pace, came five wide for the drive but
lacked a rally. DON'T DARE ME rushed up four wide early and bid three deep, vied into and around the turn then tired in upper stretch. MAXIMO STRONG
was outrun while saving ground.

Footnotes
BAKENEKO stalked the early pace, circled horses four deep on the turn, gained command in upper stretch, drew off under urging and switched to his left
lead near the sixteenth pole. UNCOMMON VALOR saved ground around the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch until taken outside near the
sixteenth then rallied. IMAGE MAKER stalked the pace, moved up in the three path to challenge for the lead turning for home then gradually weakened.
THE BIG MOZZ showed speed, saved ground on the turn and gradually weakened in the drive. TOSS A COIN raced in the three path between horses in
mid stretch and lacked a serious response. SUPER SCOOBY , in the two path inside horses turning for home, failed to rally. SOME MO bobbled when
lightly bumped at the start, circled the turn, was fanned five wide entering the stretch and gave way. SPRITZER was no factor. DON CICCIO , along the
inner rail on the turn, was outrun. CARSON AND I , unhurried early, was not a factor. TRIGZ TOO showed speed in the two path and tired leaving the turn.

ELOQUENT LADY sped clear early, set the pace off the inside and under some coaxing around the turn, wandered five wide into the stretch, was corrected
with right handed stick work soon after, kept on under pressure past the eighth pole then dug in late to hold off COUGAR VISION. COUGAR VISION broke
awkwardly then steadied soon after, regrouped and angled inside to settle, eased out into the lane and worked between rivals swung out near mid stretch
and closed gamely to gain. MORTAL STORM , forwardly placed three wide and between rivals near the half mile marker, pursued in about the two path past
the five sixteenths, was the closest pursuer past mid stretch and stayed on with interest. PETION LASS broke a bit slowly then steadied, settled well back
while saving ground, came off the inside nearing the lane, swung out very wide past the three sixteenths and closed willingly. CATERINA ONE had speed to
chase early on, was shuffled back from between rivals into the turn, came back to be in range off the rail into the lane, raced a bit erratically in mid stretch
then flattened out late. SHERIFF'S KID came in at the break and tightened foes, corrected and rated outside, steadied near the half mile marker, made a
mild four to five wide run into the stretch then churned on from there. COURAGEOUS GRACE , bumped and squeezed back at the break, moved up
between rivals leaving the far turn, dropped in and came up empty. NYMUE'S TREASURE gave hard chase inside and faded. R TRUE SENSATION ,
bumped and squeezed back at the break, was used five wide outside rivals to reach contention into the turn, chased wide to upper stretch then weakened.
PRINCESS KILLMAIN came out at the break, dropped off the pace and lacked a kick.

prompting the pace on the turn, floated to the four path entering the stretch, gained a short lead in upper stretch and gave way grudingly. ABUELO PAPS

the necessary rally. SHACKLE CAT stumbled leaving the starting gate, was four wide on the turn and lacked a rally. PEDERSON'S COURAGE chased the
pace in the two path between horses on the turn, gave way. RAD PAISLEY , bumped by SHACKLE CAT leaving the starting gate, raced wide on the turn

Footnotes
DOUBLEOSEVEN pulled his way between rivals soon into the backstretch, moved up outside and engaged GALERIO nearing the five eighths, dueled
outside that one and gained a slim advantage leaving the three eighths, was guided out a bit further into the lane, edged away slightly in mid stretch then
was fully extended to narrowly prevail. GALERIO cleared early and dropped in to set the pace, met the bid of the winner near the five furlong pole, dueled,
gave up a bit of ground nearing the eighth pole, battled back under strong handling and missed by the slimmest of margins. GENTLEMAN JOE had speed
inside foes then rated back while saving ground, came out for room near the five sixteenths, circled four wide making headway into the lane, ranged up to
loom off the dueling leaders past the sixteenth pole but could't quite get past. CLOSER LOOK , reluctant to load, saved ground stalking the pace, eased out
a bit while under pressure in upper stretch then kept on willingly. HE'S A SHOOTER stalked the dueling leaders three wide, was coaxed along to stay in
range past the three eighths, shifted out wider for the drive but failed to generate a legitimate finish. TREASURE TROVE broke slowly, settled off the inside,
circled five wide into the stretch and had belated action. BENANDJOE broke outward, checked off heels early, angled out and steadied along when keen
between runners around the first turn, regrouped and edged up near the far turn, chased in the two path into the lane then came up empty. CONTRAFLOW
lost ground five wide outside rivals around the first turn, remained well wide and lacked a serious kick. THE POSER was steadied off rivals near the seven
and a half furlong marker, eased out and raced between runners near the half mile marker, angled out for the drive and came up empty. TYBALT lagged off
the pace and never fired.

Footnotes
FEARLESS LASSIE , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, was fanned to the five path in upper stretch, gained the lead outside
WRITTENBYTHESTARS inside the eighth pole and drove clear. WRITTENBYTHESTARS set a pressured pace in the two path around the turn, drifted to
the four path in upper stretch, remained on her left lead and missed in a game effort. NOTION INTERRUPTUS lacked speed, raced in the two path on the
turn and offered a slight rally. PASS IT ON stalked the pace, was well positioned four wide approaching the stretch, got fanned six deep in upper stretch
when taking aim on the lead then weakened. SUNDAY SWAGGER , no factor, saved ground on the turn. SENSE OF MUSIC showed speed along the inner
rail and gave way. CHUBBY WARRIOR trailed.
