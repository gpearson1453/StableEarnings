INCESSANT unhurried while outside past quarter pole, rallied in earnest wide to be along in time. BEIRUT BEAUTY pressed pace three wide, raced rank to
far turn, led late, missed. BLARNEY GIRL close up to far turn, raced between horses to wire gamely. JUST FINE BY ME inside speed early, chased with no
late bid in the final stages. SEAWARD well off rail trip, while mildly in the stretch run. BIA BOLT RUNNER unhurried throughout with no late gain in the
stretch run. REMEMBRANCE widest run first turn to the lead, well rated but came up empty. GRACIANA never menaced with a wide trip.

the stretch and ran on for place. ONLY REWARD'S dueled inside to turn, stayed well kept on for show spot. SUN DRESS tracked from inside with no late
response when needed. JUJU'S SPECIALGIRL raced wide to turn with no late kick in the stretch outside. L. A. STAR no speed to turn, fanned widest and
improved position late. DULCIMER DAME raced back to turn, ran up outside past quarter pole, faltered. LIVE IT UP tracked outside to turn, gave way
readily. SEAPORT STORM speed to duel from two path, gave way readily at the half. SHAPE OF YOU squeezed early from gate, backed up ran up heels
