Footnotes
ORMA was taken under a strong hold early, steadied a bit while taken under stronger restraint near the nine-sixteenths, was hard held along the rail,
escaped the fence to the three path late on the turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, made a bid at the three-sixteenths then took the lead, responded well
in the final furlong and just held off the runner-up under strong urging. FROSTED BOURBON was reserved under a tight hold, saved ground on the turn,
was roused at the quarter-pole then came under a drive, altered out from behind foes at the furlong marker, rallied on the outside and closed well to just
miss while able to get the place. WHITE HOT showed speed then dropped just off the pace, was asked in the two path on the turn, gained to make a bid in
upper stretch, fought on well in the final furlong but missed while clear for the show. ROXEN was last to commence, settled on the outside, went three wide
for most of the turn then was carried to the five path, turned into upper stretch in the six path and lacked the needed kick. FAVORITE IMPULSE settled
towards the rear, was roused in the two path on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and improved position without threatening. SPUN FOR LU LU
settled off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, was roused at the quarter-pole and failed to rally. LIVE IN FIVE showed speed from the outside
then moved clear, controlled the action while inside on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and gave way.
TAMI'S ORCHID settled towards the back, went around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch and was no factor.
ANGELOVERTHEPULPIT settled on the outside, tucked into the two path for most of the turn, was carried four wide inside the five-sixteenths and failed to
respond. CHIACHIARONE was hustled from the start, steadied while crowded against the rail early, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
SMOKIN' T tracked the pace on the outside in the two path, took the lead into the stretch, disposed of EMPIRE RIDGE inside the furlong marker and edged
clear under strong urging. AL'S ROCKET was taken back along the rail early then quickly looked to get to the outside, was hard held while tugging at the bit
in the three path through the first turn, settled outside on the backstretch, was asked in the three path on the far turn and narrowly earned the place while
unable to go with the winner. ANSEL was taken under a vigorous hold early then reserved on the inside, came under coaxing on the far turn, shifted four
wide into the stretch then moved further out and finished willingly to just miss the place while able to get the show. EMPIRE RIDGE went to the front,
showed the way on the inside, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage into the stretch and weakened. CHARMING CHARLIE bumped with
a rival at the start, was well placed just off the pace on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and lacked the
needed kick. PIONEERING SPIRIT moved in early, settled on the inside, was roused on the final turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, moved out under a
drive near the furlong marker, was bumped by ORDER OF MAGNITUDE near the sixteenth-pole and failed to rally. ORDER OF MAGNITUDE bumped with
a foe at the start, jostled with another rival leaving the chute, was reserved in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch, bumped PIONEERING SPIRIT
near the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response. PONY SOPRANO was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, saved ground at the rear, was
hard ridden on the far turn and was no factor. CHEEKY TICO jostled with a rival leaving the chute and was taken up some, went three wide on the turns,
came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. RACE TIMES ADDED AFTER VIDEO REVIEW

Footnotes
BIG TIME LADY moved up to contest the pace on the inside of a rival, inched clear in the two path on the turn, was asked once straightened for the drive,
came under one pop of a right-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths, switched to a left-handed crop while extending the advantage coming to the furlong
marker and drew off under strong urging. MAZAL EIGHTEEN tracked the pace on the outside, was given he cue in the four path on the turn, pursued the
winner into upper stretch and proved no match while able to get the place. LINNY KATE bumped with a rival at the start then was taken up, angled in at the
rear, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and improved for the show. R WORKING GIRL disputed the pace on the outside, chased in the
three path on the turn and tired. LOT OF HONEY settled just off the pace while inside of an opponent, moved in leaving the backstretch, was urged along in
the two path on the turn and came up empty. HANDLE THE TRUTH dropped to the rail while off the pace, shifted three wide midway through the turn, came
four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. RED PEPPER GRILL broke a step slow, raced well back in the field, went three to four wide on the turn and
was no factor. STORMI CAT LADY broke out and bumped with a foe, saved ground at the rear and showed little.

BODECREAM went to the front, dropped from the four path to the two path around the first turn, set the clear pace, vied inside on the far turn, responded
well when asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive, battled inside of the runner-up in the final furlong and gamely prevailed. CITY MAN moved
from the inside to the two path on the first turn, tracked the pace down the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the two path, was given his cue at the
quarter-pole, battled outside the winner under a drive in the stretch and missed but was clear for the place. TEMPLE was rated on the inside, saved ground
through the far turn, moved out while put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. MOHS was reserved near the
back on the inside, saved ground through the final turn and improved position. JOURNEYMAN was reserved in the two path, raced under a vigorous hold
midway down the backstretch, traveled around the far turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch and gained some but failed to menace.
DREAMS OF TOMORROW was reserved in the two path, came under urging on the far turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
SOULMATE went three wide on both turns and lacked the needed response. HIEROGLYPHICS went three to four wide on the turns and was no factor.

Footnotes
JUSTINTIMEFORWINE went to the front, set the pace near the inside, came out while put to a drive in upper stretch, responded well under heavy threat in
the final furlong and determinedly held sway under strong urging. TACKLE went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved from the rail to the
three path on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, chased into the final furlong and finished willingly for the place. BRAZILLIONAIRE went around
the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside, moved closer with a half-mile to run, chased three wide on the far turn, made a bid at the quarter-pole,
battled under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the show. MR. FIDGET saved ground at the rear of the field, moved to the
two path late on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, gained into the final furlong, came between foes into the final sixteenth and got up for the last
spot in the superfecta. SUPER WICKED CHARM went around both turns in the two path, was asked for his best in upper stretch and improved position.
BOB IN OUR MIDST traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed kick. MORE LIKE IT settled on the inside, drafted inside to the two path on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch then was roused,
pursued the winner in the final furlong and was out-kicked. RALLY SQUIRREL bobbled at the start, saved ground on the first turn, moved closer midway
down the backstretch, made a bid in the two path at the three-eighths, battled under a drive in upper stretch and tired. CHEROKEE SONG went three wide
on the turns, came five wide into the stretch and failed to impact. SCOTTY went three wide on the first turn, settled well back in the field, saved ground on
the far turn and failed to threaten. ENGLISH CHARMER went three wide around the opening bend, settled on the outside, was asked three wide on the far
turn, came four wide into the stretch then moved further out at the three-sixteenths and failed to rally. SIDD FINCH was taken up briefly leaving the chute,
went four wide on the first turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor.

rallied to make a bid into the stretch, took a narrow advantage around the three-sixteenths, dueled with the winner in the final furlong and was denied while
clear for the place. OUR LAST BUCK bumped with a rival shortly after the start, settled on the outside, was urged along on the far turn, came five wide into
