Footnotes
DAGGERBOARD saved ground, angled out on the turn, bid to the front late and just lasted. HEATED BATTLE settled close up inside then closed well
losing the head bob. INVENTIONIST advanced outside, vied through the turn then tired slightly late. CAUSE I SAID SO lagged far behind then finished with
good energy along the rail. MOUNTAIN KING dropped back outside then advanced wide through the stretch. EXTREME FORCE inside early, moved very
wide on the turn and lacked a rally. WICKED DUDE raced within range near the inside and lacked a rally. E T'S DEUCES WILD led inside, dueled through
the turn then faltered. HACHACHA dropped far behind and was never in contention. M I SIX raced three wide off the pace and never a factor. VOY A TI
raced far behind throughout. POP POP'S BOY flashed speed outside and stopped losing contact with his field and returned bleeding.

BLUE PAYNT held a measured lead inside, repelled challenges and drew away while kept to her task. OBSTINATE rated inside, advanced on the final turn,
angled out in the stretch and continued well. ELUSIVE AMELIA saved ground off the pace, bid on the final turn then weakened. HASHTAG LUCKY fanned
wide on the first turn, forced the pace, drifted very wide in the stretch. BELONGS TO BABE dropped far behind then passed rivals without menacing. MAKE
OR BREAK raced wide within range and faltered. SPRITE'S LADY moved up inside on the first turn, was close up for half a mile and stopped. LIGHT UP
NIGHT lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

DAVIDIC LINE controlled the pace inside, was urged briefly in the stretch then widened under wraps in the final sixteenth. PATEGORY ONE pursued the
winner inside and finished well while no match. ALFATEI fractious in the gate, broke a bit awkwardly, steadied on the turn then rallied late. BURN AND
TURN chased outside and finished willingly while tiring slightly. THE BIG BLUFF dropped back early and lacked a response. HOLD MY CALL saved ground
behind the leaders and gave way. WHAT'S TO BLAME was urged three wide in the second flight and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
STARSHIP SUBWAY vied inside, alternated for lead and edged away under moderate pressure. FASTLIFE rated wide within range, bid on the turn,
engaged the leaders and continued well. LA PANZANELLA dueled outside to the stretch and weakened. CAPE ELIZABETH swerved to the extreme outside
to avoid the spill on the turn. PAGE ELEVEN settled off the pace and lacked a rally. WANNA BE REGAL broke slowly and raced far back throughout. MISS
JASSER lagged far behind throughout. RELENTLESS CANDY prompted the pace between rivals and gave way. A BIT BAD N BOUJEE outrun early, was
bothered trying to avoid the spill losing any chance. EVERYBODY'S PAL stopped on the turn, was bothered in the spill and was eased. REACH FOR
THESTARS fell over the stricken rival on the turn losing her rider. ELIANA'S MISSION suffered a catastrophic injury midway on the turn and fell then was
subsequently euthanized.

continued willingly. MONTELEONE chased wide throughout and finished gamely. SILENT MALICE dropped well behind inside and failed to menace.

Footnotes
EMPRESS IRENE hesitated at the start, advanced near the inside, angled out in the stretch and was up late. MS CANELA dropped well behind, rallied very
wide and finished gamely. TWICE SMITTEN dueled along the rail, led briefly in the stretch but was outfinished. NOT A TRACE settled inside off the pace
and finished willingly. INTERVENTION chased within range inside then flattened out. TAQSEEMAAT vied outside, held a narrow advantage on the turn then
faltered. POSSEINEFFECTTOO raced in midpack and lacked a rally. FROSTY FRIEND trailed early then passed fading rivals. PRESTO CHANGE O
dropped far behind and was never a factor. YELLOWSTONE GIRL raced outside early and gave way. JUST SMOK'N prompted the pace outside then
stopped after half a mile.
