Footnotes
RUNNING ROY took a quick lead while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure at the quarter pole, rounded the turn near the rail
and was steadily handled while in an outward drift. MAGIC OF LOVE was bumped inward and into Ascended leaving the chute then settled off the pace
through the backstretch, bid approaching the quarter pole, ran in the four path of the turn and dug in from the head of the lane to take second later yards.
SPLIT THE PACK came in to make contact with Magic Of Love leaving the chute then angled out to give chase, contested close off the rail on the turn,
angled inside the drifting winner through the upper stretch but flattened later yards. ASCENDED was hesitant to load then bumped off stride leaving the
chute, gave chase through the backstretch, ran in the three path of the turn and finished well. A BIT OF HARLOW steadied at the start then gave chase
leaving the chute, rounded the turn in the four path and finished well to close the gap. WE'RE FROM BRISTOL was hesitant to load then gave chase toward
the inside, ran at the rail on the turn then flattened stride. HURRICANE AMIGO broke a step slow and raced well back from early contention, rounded the
turn about the three path and finished evenly to pass rivals. STAR OF NORMANDY gave chase through the backstretch, ran in the three path of the turn,
angled to the outside into the lane but showed little further. SWEET NATION was not a factor. WHAT ABOUT SHORTY hesitated leaving the gate and was
not a factor. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Running Roy, lodged by the rider of Magic Of Love, and disqualified the former to
third place for forcing Split The Pack into the latter leaving the chute.

POSITIVE PHIL drifted a bit into the first turn then stalked two deep, moved to the front past the half mile pole, drew clear into the far turn and raced at the
rail through the turn, then kept alert in the lane. WOODHAVEN KID rated a short early lead inside, was met past the half mile pole and gave chase from that
point, dropped back into the far turn, ran at the rail rounding the turn then dueled through the stretch for second. BRIAN'S AVENUE was carried out into the
first turn then stalked from the three path, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, dropped back into the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel
for second. EPIC WEST rated close off the rail, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail, but drifted to
the five path nearing the head of the lane and finished evenly. MINE TO HOLD saved early ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far
turn about the three path, was carried out to the six path leaving the turn and showed little further. IRISHTOWN saved ground racing well back, picked up
the chase leaving the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn but drifted to the seven path toward the head of the lane and had little left.
SHAMCAT rounded the first turn about the five path, raced outside into the backstretch and never factored. FEATURE ACT broke awkwardly and raced well
back. RING THE BELLA settled off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole then faded toward the far turn. PERFETTO rounded the first turn

CASTLE LIGHTS took over past the half mile pole and rated the pace, came under pressure into the turn, ran at the rail through the turn and was steadily
handled in the lane. NORDIC DANCER broke a step slow then gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn, eased outward through the lane and got up
for second later yards. MY SISTER PAM chased, rounded the turn off the rail then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. EXCUSES EXCUSES broke sharply
then gave chase past the half mile pole, though, flattened at the rail on the turn. CEDAR'S WISH gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path and
showed little in the lane. WITNESS THE ENERGY saved ground. IHEARTRAINACOMN was never a factor and raced in the four path of the turn.

UNEXPECTEDLY settled off the rail, bid past the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, came between horses mid-stretch and dug in to
take the nod through later yards. LIL SWEETHEART rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near
the rail, drifted toward the head of the lane and put My Dream Girl away through the upper stretch, but picked up the winner leaving the sixteenth pole and
grudgingly ceded the nod to that one through later yards. SAILING ROCK settled close in the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and continued in
the three path of the far turn, dueled to secure third mid-stretch and was gaining on the top two. MY DREAM GIRL stalked off the rail, gave chase nearing
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and remained close through the upper stretch before flattening stride. SMART ENTRY rounded the
first turn in the four path then saved ground into the second turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn and raced evenly
down the lane. WHOSE THAT LADY rounded the first turn about the three path and settled off the pace from the seven eighths pole, picked up the chase
leaving the seven sixteenths but weakened in the three path of the far turn. RAINBOW RIVER saved early ground, raced outside into the backstretch and
showed little response.

SONG OF HONOR rated close early, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, took the lead three wide midway on the far turn then drew off under steady
handling. IMAGINE VICTORY raced off the pace in the three path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and was eased outward on the far turn, entered the
stretch in the four path, dug in from the eighth pole to take, and settle, for second mid-stretch. DOOR BUSTER rounded the opening turn about the four path
then stalked from the seven eighths pole, closed to even terms and dueled from the three eighths, had a slim lead at the five sixteenths pole but was caught
midway on the far turn and flattened inside the eighth pole. ANNA ROCKS settled off the rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened stride
off the rail on the far turn. UPSY DAISY DO showed little response through the backstretch. LADY KAZA stalked the early pace two deep then faded past
the seven sixteenths pole. MISS WILD took the lead into the first turn and rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and
was met at the pole, gave chase from that point but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
JESSICA rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was caught past the five sixteenths, gave chase from that point and
was eased around KALENJIN into the lane, dug in for the lead past the sixteenth pole and ran clear toward the wire. The latter settled off the pace in the
three path the first turn, bid at the three eighths pole and took the lead three wide past the five sixteenths, angled in across the path of Dinner At Five into
the far turn, ran at the rail through the turn and dug in under steady handling, but was caught flattening stride later yards. ALPINE MOON saved early
ground then angled out with a bid toward the five sixteenths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn and finished evenly. LADY MACHO saved ground off the
pace, bid at the rail into the far turn, angled to the five path through the turn, came back inward past the eighth pole and finished evenly. DAZZLE ME settled
off the early pace in the three and four paths then rounded the far turn about the six path. DINNER AT FIVE stalked off the rail then challenged at the three
eighths pole, dueled between horses from that point, was pinched back nearing the quarter pole, continued chase into the far turn but weakened past the
eighth pole. FLOATING BY saved ground. SKI BUNNY settled off the pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole
but weakened into the far turn. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Roof Top Bar, lodged by the rider of Dinner At Five, and
disqualified the former to sixth place for coming in on the latter nearing the quarter pole.
