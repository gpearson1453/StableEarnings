Footnotes
KACTUS KATE set the pace along the inside, shook clear of a pressing foe passing the quarter pole, shifted outwardly in midstretch, and held sway to the
iwre. OOPSY DAISY stalked along the inside, saved ground around the bend, chased along the rail to bid for place at the furlong grounds after outer foes
did the same, and prevailed over those rivals while not threatening the leader. CAVIAR RESOLUTION tracked three wide around the first turn, then two to
three wide around the far turn, came into the lane between horses, chased among those rivals while on his left lead, and just reached show while getting
outkicked by an inner foe for place. LETS GO ALL THEWAY stalked two wide, pressed the leader into the far turn, but failed to keep pace with that rival at
the quarter pole, chased while shifting outwardly to stay outside of the leader in midstretch, but faltered between horses late. SWEET CONFUSION took a
brush from an outer foe into an inner rival soon after the start, trailed the field in the two path, swung four wide while ranging closer turning for home, but
leveled off in midstretch.

Footnotes
PLEMMONSTON reared in the gate pre-race, the took a solid bump to his hind quarters from an inner foe at the start, stalked the clear leader along the
inside, ranged closer turning for home, took aim while tipping two wide entering the lane, bid approaching the furlong grounds, and drove clear. OXBOW
WIND sped clear, met PLEMMONSTON's bid approaching midstretch, but was headed at the furlong pole, and proved second best. EL MIC TIESUN was
sandwiched between horses due to an inner foe veering outwardly, trailed the field along the inside, moved inside of a pair of rivals entering the lane to
claim show at the quarter pole, and grinded away to cut the gap on the leading pair thereafter. YANKEE HAIL CAT veered out sharply at the start and
hindered a pair of rivals, raced far off of the pace, came into the lane three wide, and failed to factor. DIGNIFIED N KRAFTY chased outside of the leader for
a quarter mile, but steadily folded thereafter.

Footnotes
CREOLE CHARLIE set the pace, built a clear margin into the turn, widened that advantage through upper stretch, and drew further away while being ridden
out. GRIEF chased from midpack while in the three to four path around the turn, then stayed on to gain place in the final sixteenth. THUNK broke inwardly
and bumped a foe at the start, stalked three wide, tucked to the rail at the half mile pole, claimed place from an outer rival at the three sixteenths pole while
not threatening the leader, then was caught by an outer foe for that position late. CUSTOM KAT tracked from midpack along the inside, chased through
upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, then shifted four wide approaching the final sixteenth, but failed to menace. MAKATI PHIL bobbled at the start,
pressed the eventual from the outside, chased that rival around the turn, then faded in upper stretch. DAPPER DAN MAN broke outwardly and bumped a
foe at the start, then failed to factor. GALLANT STAR was pinched back between horses at the start, then never got involved. WICKED ALEX was outrun
along the inside. DUE TO THE FURLONG POLE BEAM BEING TRIPPED EARLY BY A FLYING BIRD, THE FIVE FURLONG FRACTION WAS
HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
BELMAR BEAUTY allowed an outer CAVE CREEK to clear early on in order to prompt that foe from the outside, forged an advantage at the quarter pole,
and inched away through the lane. CAVE CREEK set the pace inside of the eventual winner, but was headed at the quarter pole, and kept on to secure
place. LUCKY LINZ laid off of the pace three wide, came lane five wide and between horses, then stayed on, and proved best of the rest while cutting the
gap on the leading pair. BLONDIE LOX BABE chased along the inside, shifted three wide in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, and lacked a bid.
MAD TABBY saved ground off of the pace, and chased along the rail through the lane. ALTERED DREAM tracked from midpack two wide, shifted four wide
entering the lane, but lacked a kick on his left lead. KEHRON'S CREED broke a bit outwardly and was steadied at the start due to over-correction from the
rider, gained ground four wide around the turn, floated six wide entering the lane, but flattened out. CHANSON LA BELLE was outrun. GET DIRECTIONS
stalked three wide, but failed to keep pace with the leading pair entering the lane, and weakened between horses at the three sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
SWANAGE set the pace along the inside, drew away from a pressing foe in upper stretch, and held sway to the wire. JUST PASSING THRU trailed, swung
five wide in upper stretch, and rallied willingly to reach place in the final sixteenth. COUNTRY TIME pressed the pace setter from the outside, but failed to
keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, chased evenly thereafter, but lost place in the late stages. MS SATCH MO rated off of the pace while shifting from
the fur path to the two path around the first turn, shifted back to the four path into the far turn, came into the lane between horses, and lacked a bid. KATIE'S
KARAT tracked five to four wide around the first turn, stalked three wide around the far turn, but only managed to chase through upper stretch before fading
through the final furlong. COINMAKER stalked two to three wide and from between horses, but faded entering the lane. EPHEMERAL stalked along the
inside, but faded through upper stretch without rider encouragement possibly due to the saddle slipping forward a bit, and was eased through the final
furlong.

CRUMP tracked from well off of the leaders while in the two path, ranged closer turning for home before tipping outside of the leading pair entering the lane,
rallied with a quick spurt in upper stretch to bid passing the three sixteenths, led at the furlong grounds, and drove clear. ALEJANDRO broke a bit inwardly,
trailed the field along the inside, rallied along the rail entering the lane to claim show while getting outkicked by an outer rival, then shifted three wide at the
furlong pole as that foe took charge, and chased him home to claim place in the late stages while proving second best. FAN CLUB pressed the pace two
wide while opening up on the rest of the field, forged an advantage from his inner counterpart at the five sixteenths pole, drove clear in upper stretch, but
met CRUMP's bid at the three-sixteenths, got headed at the furlong pole, and lost place late. GLOBAL EMPIRE tracked three wide, but faded around the far
turn. ARDANWOOD set the pace while being stoutly pressured by an outer rival, but was headed by that foe at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened.

ADELAIDE MISS set a clear and unpressured pace along the inside, felt mild pressure from CLARA PEETERS (GB) turning for home, got set down in
upper stretch and gamely maintained a margin from that foe through upper stretch, then inched further clear entering the final furlong, and held sway safely.
CLARA PEETERS (GB) stalked the clear leader two wide, ranged up turning for home to take aim on that rival, but only managed to chase that foe through
upper stretch, failed to keep pace entering the final furlong, and lasted for place. RUSSIAN MAFIA settled at he rear along the inside, took the far turn in the
two path inside of ELKE DO JAGUARETE (BRZ), but was denied racing room by that foe while attempting to tip four wide entering the lane, shifted back
inwardly shortly after, split foes two wide at the three sixteenths pole, rallied through the final furlong, but missed reaching place on the wire. APPLE
DAPPLE tracked two wide, tipped three wide entering the lane, and chased evenly. ELKE DO JAGUARETE (BRZ) broke a step slowly, settled at the rear
two wide, took the far turn in the three path, tipped four wide entering the lane before taking a bump from an inner foe who wanted that path, then lacked a
rally thereafter. MOM'S RED LIPSTICK stalked along the inside, but faded in upper stretch.

GALAXY THIRTYSIX stalked three wide, rallied in upper stretch while taking aim on a clear G'S SQUEEZE, bid outside of that foe at the furlong grounds
sparking a duel, sparred to the wire, and prevailed. G'S SQUEEZE broke outwardly at the start, set the pace along the inside, inched briefly clear passing
the quarter pole, but dug in at the furlong grounds as GALAZY THIRTYSIX produced a menacing bid, battled with that foe through the final furlong, but was
outdueled. MISS NITAP chased along the inside, and kept on through the lane to gain show at the furlong pole. THE COMPLETE COURT stalked two wide,
but was outkicked by an outer rival at the three sixteenths pole, and tired on his left lead. BIRDIE CALL hopped at the start, laid at the rear three wide,
minorly improved in the three to four path around the bend, but flattened out before factoring. NEW YEAR'S PARTY settled at the rear two wide and
between horses, but never got involved. STEPH'SFULLASUGAR saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail.

DREAM PEACEFUL set the pace outside of a pressing rival, drove clear in upper stretch, and lasted to the wire. PAT HAND GIRL broke inwardly while off a
step slowly and bumped a foe at the start, trailed early on, gained swiftly along the rail turning for home, tipped three wide in upper stretch, and sustained a
rally to produce a late bid, but missed. GOLDEN ARTIST pressed along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, then lost place in
the final sixteenth. TWO PUNCH FIST bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked along the inside early on, but faltered to be far off of the pace into the
turn, then sustained stride through the lane to catch outer foes for a minor share. TUGBOAT broke a step slowly and took a bump from an outer foe at the
start, took the turn in the five to six path while well outside of foes and far off of the pace, then moved up in the center of the track in the late stages.
CUSTOM GUITAR split foes to achieve inside stalking position into the turn, stayed in the two path before shifting to the three path in upper stretch, but
faded without being asked for his best run. MEMPHIS MELTDOWN bumped with an outer foe at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide
turning for home, but failed to factor. LA FEME JOLIE broke outwardly, but failed to make an impact. LAKE RUNNER never got involved. AUTUMN'S LIL
DOLL tracked four to three wide, but tired through the final furlong. BOTH OURS chased three wide, but faded between horses at the five sixteenths pole.
