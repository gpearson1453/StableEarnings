Footnotes
FLECHE D'AMOUR chased the leader between horses through the opening half mile, switched to the outside entering the turn, began a four wide bid
passing the three eighths pole, kicked clear entering the stretch and held his margin while drifting out and then back in to the wire. CLEVER KITTEN chased
the frontrunner on the inside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge while racing three wide around the turn, could not go with the winner in the stretch
and chased that rival home, the best of the rest. ADIOS CHICAS raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from
the two path and gained ground between horses late. ONLY GIRL chased the pacesetter between horses up the backstretch, raced in the three path around
the turn and finished evenly on the outside while never threating the top two. UNCAPTURED FAITH raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through
the opening half mile, saved ground around the turn and flattened out on the rail in late stretch. SHE IS ROYALTY bumped with the horse to her outside
leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and made no bid. HAPPY'S NICE CANDY led the field through
the opening quarter of a mile, opened up heading into the turn, saved ground from there, and faded in the final furlong. NADINE'S GIRL bumped with the
horses to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the
turn and continued to tire in the stretch.

SMILING TEUFLES broke alertly despite receiving a bump from DALIO, vied outside FRIAR TUCK virtually throughout, and held firm to prevail late. FRIAR
TUCK alternated for the lead with SMILING TEUFLES through the opening half-mile, and stayed on gamely through a long drive to narrowly miss.
BOLDNESS got bumped between BASTIEN LE BROWN and GIVE ME TWO STEPS at the start, was under a drive chasing the battling leaders on the turn,
stayed on his left lead through the drive and was inching closer from outside at the finish. BASTIEN LE BROWN bumped with BOLDNESS at the start, and
was otherwise no factor inside. DALIO broke in bumping SMILING TEUFLES, chased outside to midway on the turn, and drifted five or six wide tiring past
the quarter-pole. GIVE ME TWO STEPS bumped with BOLDNESS at the start, and was outrun two wide.

SHES ALL WOMAN advanced three wide around the turn, seized command nearing the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. PATRICK'S LASS pressed
the pace two wide, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole, was no match for the winner but stayed on to be clearly second best. WEDONTBELIEVEHER
set the pace along the rail, was collared nearing the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. LUANN chased the pace two wide, angled four wide near the
quarter pole and came up empty in the lane. INFATUATING trailed in the four path.

Footnotes
THATAINT TOOSHABBY brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in
the middle of the pack between horses, began a sweeping bid from the three path midway around the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and held her margin
to the wire under a drive. ARETE'S CHALICE pressed the pace from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from
the two path passing the three eighths pole, dueled in upper stretch, could not go with the winner late and chased that rival home, the best of the rest.
CHESS NOT CHECKERS raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, saved ground around the far
turn and gained ground on the outside in late stretch while proving to be no match for the top two. UNCAPTURED GRACE saved ground around the first
turn, stalked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, and drifted out mildly in the stretch while finishing evenly.
COUNTESSOFLOVELACE raced off the pace in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path, swung
wide entering the stretch and improved position mildly down the lane. ALL IN JEST fought her rider while being carried out to the seven path racing into the
first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack, angled in to save ground around the far turn, and passed tiring horses in the stretch. LINN
PIER raced five wide around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the four path,
swung wider still into the stretch and was outkicked from there. SPICY HONEY (IRE) raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the backstretch in
the middle of the pack between horses, continued around the far turn in the two path and weakened in the stretch. Z FIRST led the field while saving ground
around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground while dueling around the far turn and faded in the final furlong. MISS YOUNIVERSE
brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, drifted out to the six path headed into the first turn, raced off the pace on outside up the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the two path and came up empty in the stretch. ROYAL ROCKER raced four wide around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the
outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and tired down the lane. MISS INEZ raced between horses early, headed into the first
turn four wide, was pulled back sharply by her rider midway around the first turn, trailed far behind the field the rest of the way around the oval and was later
vanned off. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
HARD COUNT settled in midpack three wide to the stretch, rallied steadily while remaining on his left lead, caught the leaders from outside in deep stretch
and drove clear near the finish. MISTER KELLY dueled inside AMOR LEJANO from the outset, got the best of their dispute leaving the furlong grounds, and
held well for the place. AMOR LEJANO (ARG) vied outside MISTER KELLY for better than a half-mile, and weakened late. BEE BY THE SEA was a step
slow to begin, saved ground outsprinted for three-eighths of a mile, shifted off the inside improving through upper stretch, and finished evenly. ABSOLUTE
GRIT broke two lengths slow, was behind horses trailing two wide into the turn, fanned to the five-path approaching the stretch and gained only mildly.
FLASH OF PROMISE stayed in range to the end of the turn two wide, and lugged in tiring through midstretch. PUTIN ONLINE never reached contention
racing four wide. MILITARY DRILL was forwardly placed inside to the end of the turn, and had nothing left.

Footnotes
FRANKIE'S GIRL chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path passing the three eighths pole, kicked clear in upper
stretch and drew off to the wire. RAKASA raced off the pace between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the three path,
began a bid approaching the quarter pole and chased the winner home from there. RASPBERRY BALLET raced at the back of the pack on the outside in
the early going, began to improve position while racing in the four path around the turn, and gained ground on the outside in late stretch. ILKNUR raced off
the pace on the inside up the backstretch, moved up while racing in the three path around the turn and continued to improve position mildly down the lane.
IRAZU trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground while still at the back of the pack around the turn, and gained ground late.
FUTURE FLAY pressed the pace on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, couldn't go with the frontrunners entering the stretch and was
outkicked. WELL SHES HANDSOME led the field between horses up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the far turn
and weakened in the final furlong. JADE EMPRESS raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path
and tired entering the stretch. IDEAL BREEZE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the early going, began to drop back quickly while racing in the
three path around the turn, swung wide into the stretch and was not pushed down the lane while finishing in the middle of the track.

Footnotes
EYES ON TARGET tugged along inside while reserved early, shifted to the two-path awaiting room approaching the stretch, remained bottled up turning for
home, charged through a narrow opening between horses while being nudged out to brush lightly with GROUP HUG, and kicked away once clear. WING
COMMANDER established a moderate pace inside, repelled a challenge from TORETTO coming off the far turn and shook away again, could not withstand
the winner but held well. SEVEN CHANNELS saved ground close up for six furlongs, moved off the inside to loom a threat through the furlong grounds,
shifted further out and brushed into TORETTO with the rider taking a look back, and was outkicked. GROUP HUG was a step slow at the start, went along
two wide to the far turn, shifted further out roused into the stretch, brushed lightly with EYES ON TARGET while outside that one past the eighth-pole, and
did not have enough. TORETTO prompted the pace outside WING COMMANDER, could not reach that one under heavy pressure into upper stretch, got
brushed and squeezed off between SEVEN CHANNELS and an onrushing EYES ON TARGET into the last eighth of a mile, and checked out of it. BIG
BLUE broke a step slow, and was no factor three to four wide. LIGHTNING ROD raced three wide, and tired in the stretch. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS
INQUIRY FOCUSING ON SEVEN CHANNELS AND TORETTO, AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE TRAINER OF GROUP
HUG, THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

lost second late. CHARLOTTE THE BRIT raced off the pace four wide and rallied belatedly outside. HENNI PENNY raced off the pace three wide and had a
mild stretch gain. DAY'S HUMOR was in range inside and lacked a closing bid. MY MASTERPIECE saved ground and failed to menace. TORN JEANS
played no factor while racing two wide. YELLEN tracked the pace three wide, edged closer nearing the lane but came up empty in the drive. JULIE BIRD
(IRE) was outrun while racing five wide.
