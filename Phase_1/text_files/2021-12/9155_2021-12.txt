Footnotes
SPECTACULAR GEM just off leaders off rail, rallied into stretch, edged clear held. COUNTER OFFER unhurried, split horses mid turn, ran on for place,
bested rest. JOHN'S ROCK good inside speed to the front, stayed to stretch, weakened. FIRE MARSHALL BILL unhurried while never far back, little
improvement late. FLAT OUT BEAUTIFUL trailed early, improved position from the far turn, not a threat. OSAGE MOON never menaced throughout.
CLEAR FOR ACTION chased leader to the stretch, used up, and faded in the drive. FIRST DEPUTY perfect position to the half, nothing left and dropped
back. INVENTING BLAME checked around the first turn and not a factor thereafter.
