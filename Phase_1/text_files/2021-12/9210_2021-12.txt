Footnotes
PROUD AMERICAN pressed the leader from the outside, took a clear lead nearing the eighth pole and held well to prove best under strong handling. FOUR
HUNDRED PROOF AA was off a step slow, hustled in the early stages, raced in the two path through the lane and closed in well late on the leader in the
final stages. RECKLESS LOVE MHF settled off the early going, raced along the inside nearing the quarter pole, angled four wide in the stretch run and had
not enough for the top pair. WMA FIREBALL settled off the early pace, raced four to three wide in the drive and had no final winning bid. RB MUNCHIE
showed good early speed from the inside and gave way the final eighth of a mile. RB BAMER dropped back early, raced four deep into the upper stretch
and had no late response.
