Footnotes
ARTIE'S ROSE was off a bit slow, pulled early between rivals, waited for room while steadying some on the turn, came through a large opening on the rail
turning for home, responded, closed willingly and kicked clear under urging. GAVICHI raced close up on the inside, came through on the rail at the half mile
marker to contest the pace, dueled on the turn, drifted out at the quarter pole, then dug in gamely in the stretch drive and got the place spot. CARLY
HUSTLE raced off the pace, made a five wide run at the quarter pole, rallied outside and just missed for second. FRAME THIS stalked close up outside,
came four wide into the lane and lacked a stretch rally. B B'S ROCKET vied inside for the lead, then dueled two wide on the turn and tired. SEAMIALAUGH
stumbled at the start, vied three wide for the lead, then dueled four wide and tired. BEYOND A MILLION vied between rivals for the early lead, then dueled
three wide and faded.

start, raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. HALSTAAT raced off the pace inside, chased on the turn and tired.

BIG CITY BOB pressed the early pace, then stalked DIESEL, was asked at the quarter pole, rallied inside entering the stretch, took over, drew clear and
held on late. THE RIGHT PATH raced off the pace, advanced on the turn, angled out, came three wide into the lane, made a strong late run outside and
was gaining at the finish. HARPER raced two wide off the pace, moved up at the quarter pole, rallied mildly between rivals in the stretch and earned the
show spot. DIESEL set the pace, opened up a comfortable lead, showed the way into the stretch, then faltered in the final furlong. OPEN LENGTHS raced
off the pace, moved up between rivals into the stretch, then failed to threaten. DECKOLOGY stalked three wide, then chased and tired. MR THRIFTY raced
off the pace inside and did not factor. LUCKY HERO stalked four wide and gave way.

JAKARTA set a measured pace inside, drew clear in the stretch and was kept to a drive while remaining safe. MISS MOSAIC settled off the pace, rallied
inside to the stretch and continued gamely. DON'T CALL ME MARY prompted the pace between rivals for half a mile and faltered. TRUTH HURTS saved
ground within range then weakened in the stretch. PROMISED STORM dropped far behind, began advancing on the turn and finished with good energy. DR
B bobbled badly soon after the start, stalked outside and faded. LIKE A PRO trailed to the stretch then caught fading rivals. EXCITABLE LADY dropped
back inside then gave way readily. HEY MAMALUKE forced the pace outside for half a mile, stopped and was eased late.

furlong marker and drew clear under urging. DAVIDIC LINE vied two wide for the lead, dueled with ROCK ON LUKE on the backside and far turn, battled
into the lane, dug in gamely in the final furlong held on for the place award. I AM REDEEMED tracked close up on the inside, chased the leaders on the far
turn, angled out, came three wide into the lane, was in tight and lacked room at the eighth pole, altered course, rallied in the two path and just missed for
second. BIRD KING raced off the pace between rivals, moved up on the far turn, came two wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. SOMEDAY JONES
was outrun early and passed tired rivals. ROCK ON LUKE bobbled at the break, vied inside for the lead, dueled with DAVIDIC LINE on the far turn, dug in
entering the stretch and then weakened late. INFORMATIVE steadied on the first turn, raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. SENIOR
INVESTMENT raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor.

Footnotes
R GOODTIME CHARLIE vied outside for the early lead, briefly got clear, dueled into the stretch, dug in gamely in the final furlong and determinedly held off
the runner up. THE REIGN MAN chased between rivals early, moved up inside on the turn, rallied inside, dueled with the winner through the stretch and dug
in gamely to the wire. COUNT THE SHELLS chased three wide, moved up on the turn, made a bid at the quarter pole, rallied outside and flattened out in
the lane. RUN FAST raced off the pace inside, steadied in tight entering the turn, rallied mildly inside in the stretch and shared the fourth spot. TAINO
chased four wide, continued four wide on the turn, came six wide into the lane, rallied mildly outside and shared fourth. LAZARETTO raced off the pace
between rivals, went three wide on the turn and had no rally. ADMIRAL EASTWOOD raced off the pace and failed to threaten. JOINT AND SEVERAL was
off a bit slow, chased four wide on the turn and tired. BAVARIA chased inside and faded. DAGGERBOARD stumbled badly at the start, raced off the pace
and did not factor. COMBAT RIBBON vied inside for the early lead, was injured past the half mile marker, pulled up and vanned off. After a Stewards'
Inquiry, the race was declared official.
