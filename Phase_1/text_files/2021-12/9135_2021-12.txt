STRANDS OF PEARLS set the early pace on the inside, then dueled for the lead on the turn with DWELLER, then came again in the furlong grounds and
was clear late to prove best under a drive. DWELLER hit the gate coming out at the start, then went up to duel for the lead two wide by the three eighths,
then gained a short advantage leaving the turn but hung in the final furlong. MARTHARITA chased the early pace three wide, then came four to five wide
into the drive, angled out leaving the three sixteenths, closed well late while on the left lead. AMAZINGMAE was settled early and made a four wide move
on the turn to loom boldly but flattened out in the drive. TROPICALDEPRESSION chased the early pace on the inside, then shifted out three wide leaving
the turn but had no kick. SHE'S A GUNFIGHTER dropped back. AWESOME TAP was settled four wide and weakened. SIMPLE JUSTICE was not a factor.

remain clear. EYE OF GUNFIGHTER was rated along and made a four wide move on the turn, could not go with the winner while staying on for the place
award. OSCAR WINNER was a bit fractious when the gates opened and broke in the air, then was four wide into the first turn, advanced on the far turn and
came four wide into the stretch, closed well late, got nod for the show award. MASTERFUL TOUCH was off a step slow, then was reserved early, then
advanced three wide on the turn, then rallied well on the inside late to just miss the show award. YES FOR LESS lacked a rally. WHERE'S THE BEN'S
passed the tiring rivals. ROYAL'S INVASION tracked the early pace three wide and tired. STORM ALFEET failed to menace. KINZEA STONE set the pace

Footnotes
READY AND RICH chased the early pace four wide, then shifted inside on the turn and was saving ground by the quarter pole while advancing, angled out
leaving the three sixteenths for dead aim on the front runner, closed well to edge away late under a drive. STRONG BREEZE set the early pace on the
inside, shook clear leaving the turn but could not hold off the winner late while staying on to be second best. CHEEK TO CHEEK stumbled badly at the start,
was settled back early and was three to four wide on the turn, swung out six wide for the drive and offered a late rally to gain the show award.
DROSSELMOON stalked the pace three wide, then was floated out five wide entering the stretch, but had no kick in the drive. NEVERLOOKBACK chased
the early pace in between horses and weakened. HEY CONGRATS stumbled at the start, then was hustled between horses to prompt the pace and
weakened. COMMISSIONER BIGGS was reserved early on the inside, then swung out seven wide for the drive and had no rally. BROWN EYED BOY
chased the pace two wide and weakened.

COOL COMEDIAN stalked the early pace while in hand and three wide, made a bid nearing the five sixteenths, drew clear by the quarter pole and drew off
from there to prove much the best while being ridden out. MCQUEEN'S BULLITT was reserved early, then was two to three wide by the quarter pole, then
rallied well late towards the inside to gain the place award. MENTALIST broke outwardly at the start, then chased the pace four wide and had no kick in the
drive while besting the rest. FLYING WITH ANGELS was reserved early, then was three to four wide by the quarter pole, shifted out leaving the three
sixteenths and had no rally. SHADYS KEEPER set the pace on the inside and was headed by the five sixteenths by the winner and weakened. URBAN

to duel for command on the turn, then vied for the lead between horses by the furlong marker and flattened out, bested rest. P JS SILVER DUKE was
allowed to settle on the inside, eased out leaving the five sixteenths and came four wide into the drive and had a belated rally. SOUPER CATCH was well

FLANK SPEED pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid to shake clear on the turn, then was challenged by MEMORY BOUQUET by the quarter
pole, then held that rival off in the stretch to prevail under a drive. MEMORY BOUQUET was settled early, made a four wide move on the turn to loom
boldly, then was gaining late but hung, just missed. TORPEDO MAX broke awkwardly at the start, then advanced five wide on the turn and came seven
wide into the stretch and closed well late. MIZZEN MONEY was allowed to settle early, advanced four wide by the quarter pole, was blocked by the three
sixteenths and then angled in by the furlong marker and rallied late on the inside. CAPITAN FOFO chased the early pace, then was shuffled back on the
turn, came five wide in to the drive and had no punch. FLOAT ON chased the early pace three wide, came five wide into thye drive and was empty.
LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA lacked a rally. TRADERS LUCK set a pressured pace on the inside and faltered.

Footnotes
HOT TO PARTY was well placed early and made a inside bid on the turn to gain a short advantage, then was headed leaving the turn, battled back on the
inside in the furlong grounds to get up to prove best under a drive, resolutely. DIAL A LADY broke outwardly at the start, then made a four wide move on the
turn, took over leaving the turn, then lugged in by the three sixteenth causing the rider on SOCIAL EXCLUSION to check, then was outfinished late to just
miss. LEFTATTHEALTAR chased the early pace on the inside, then eased off the inside on the turn to be four wide by the quarter pole, then came five wide
into the drive and rallied. SOCIAL EXCLUSION prompted the pace three wide and made a bid between rivals on the turn, then checked leaving the three
sixteenths, shifted out and kept on to just miss the show award. NORMANS GIRL GAYLE was settled back early, advanced and was five wide by the
quarter pole and offered a belated rally. MUNNY CALL lacked a rally. MIZSHIPMAN was allowed to settle early and came five wide into the drive but offered
no rally. MAKEMEASAMMICH set the pace two wide and stopped.
