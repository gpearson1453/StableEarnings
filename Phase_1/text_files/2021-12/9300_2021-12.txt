Footnotes
BOSSY BRIDE pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid mid way on the far turn, took over and drew clear leaving the turn, then remained clear to
prove best under left handed crop urging. AMI'S LINK was settled early, then advanced to be well placed on the inside on the far turn behind the pace
setters, eased out leaving the quarter pole to come three wide into the drive, finished willingly to be clearly second best. MISS SPRINKLES set a pressured
pace on the inside and was headed on the far turn and weakened, bested rest. LAURA'S ANGLE was four wide into the first turn, then chased the pace four
wide and tired. COOL SOCIETY was allowed to settle on the inside and had no response.

KIRBY was well rated early while in the two path, eased out nearing the quarter pole and made a five wide bid leaving the turn to take over, then drew off
smartly to prove much the best under a drive. MISS PARFAIT was bumped at the start, then made a inside move leaving the quarter pole, then finished
willingly but was no match for the winner while clearly second best. GLOSSY MADRINA was allowed to settle early on the inside, swung out four wide for
the drive and was up for the show award. REAWAKENED vied for the early lead five wide, made a four wide bid on the turn and weakened, lost show spot
late. MUNNY CALL was allowed to settle early and was four to five wide on the turn and had no rally. R CHERRY was settled back early, then was four wide
by the quarter pole, split rivals at the furlong marker and moved up late. SWEET SAVAGE vied for the early lead between horses and four wide and
weakened. MAKEMEASAMMICH vied for the early lead three wide and in between rivals and weakened. EMERALD FEVER broke in at the start, then vied
for the lead on the inside and faltered. The jockey on number one GLOSSY MADRINA claimed foul against number three MISS PARFAIT for alleged

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S BLADE stalked the pace and made a four wide bid leaving the three sixteenths pole and drew clear to prove best under a drive. DANCE A
LITTLE JIG was close up early on the inside, then rated back and eased out three wide on the turn, then dropped down to the inside by the furlong marker
and finished well to be clearly second best. VALENTINA'S CUPID was allowed to settle early, then was three wide by the quarter pole and offered a late
rally for the show award. EMILIA STRONG was settled back early, came six wide into the drive and had a belated rally. CAPRICHOSA pressed the early
pace two wide, then dropped down to the inside on the turn while dropping back, swung out four wide leaving the turn and weakened. FALSE RULING set a
pressured pace three wide, then made a bid to draw clear on the turn and then had nothing left for the final furlong. LA BELLA CHICA chased the early pace
and weakened. AS YOU WERE broke in a tangle, failed to menace.

ENTHRONED broke outwardly at the start, then vied for the early lead three wide, then took over entering the backstretch and drew clear, then drew off on
the turn, then was kept to pressure to remain clear. SILVER LOCKS was reluctant to load, then rated along early behind the two pace setters, then
advanced on the inside on the turn, tipped out four wide for the drive to have aim on the front runner, but failed to gain on that rival while being second best.
NABRUZZI checked after the start, then was void of early speed, then offered a belated rally on the inside. MYSTERY ITEM vied for the early lead on the
inside, then tracked the pace on the backstretch and tired.

Footnotes
BREEZE BURNER was rated along while two to three wide, made a three wide bid on the far turn to be clear by the quarter pole, then was sent down
leaving the furlong marker, and kept a safe margin to the wire to prove best. ESPRESSO CALIENTE was four wide into the first turn, then tracked the early
pace four to three wide, came four wide into the drive and finished well but could not get to the winner while holding on to the place gamely. BUILT THAT
WAY was rated along the inside, then was in the two path by the quarter pole and rallied well to just miss the place award. CATTLE DRIVE was three wide
into the first turn, then settled and dropped back and then lacked a rally. MOBEATYABAD was away alertly to set the early pace while clear, then was
headed nearing the five sixteenths pole and gave way.
