Footnotes
BEECHNUT TROPHY settled off the early pace while racing three wide around the first turn, moved closer four wide around the far turn, seized command
leaving the eighth pole and edged ahead. AL QAHIRA pressed the pace two wide around the first turn, led two wide down the backstretch, angled in to set
the pace along the rail entering the far turn, vied inside around the bend, briefly kicked clear in upper stretch, was collared by the winner in midstretch but
fought on inside to hold second. BESIDE HERSELF raced in range two wide, dropped back under urging around the far turn, angled five wide in upper
stretch, finished well and just missed second. OAKHURST raced off the pace four and five wide and had a mild rally outside. MY PHILLY TWIRL stalked the
pace four wide around the first turn, bid three wide around the far turn, reached even terms near the quarter pole then weakened in the lane. TIZ KOBE
TIME disputed the pace inside for a half, chased two wide early on the far turn, swung five wide nearing the lane and finished evenly. ATHENAIS failed to
menace while racing two wide. QUALITY CONTROL played no factor while racing three wide most of the way and swinging eight wide turning for home.
COLD CALL tracked the pace three wide around the first turn, bid two wide between foes around the far turn and tired in the drive. BARRETT was outrun
inside. CHANGE PLANS raced well back two wide around the first turn, went four and five wide around the far turn and never threatened. ARTUME
stumbled at the start and trailed throughout. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
PENS STREET dueled inside MISS MIKAELA through the opening six furlongs, gained the upper hand into the stretch and pulled clear under a drive. MISS
MIKAELA went head and head outside PENS STREET for six furlongs, weakened through upper stretch remaining on her left lead, and remained clear of
the rest. HEIRESSINDY tracked the duel in the clear, and lacked the needed response outside. RASPBERRY BALLET raced three to four wide around the
turn, lugged in through midstretch and had no rally. MISS ITALY broke slowest and was far back early, began moving along the inside past the quarter-pole,
altered course off the rail when RASPBERRY BALLET came over in front of her in midstretch, and ran on evenly. CAT'S J N J raced toward the inside and
never factored.

Footnotes
AWESOME APEAL led the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn in upper stretch, turned back her challenger to
pull ahead in the final sixteenth of a mile and held that margin to the wire. CHASING JOY hit the gate and swerved in at the break, was hustled up the to
chase the leaders on the inside, saved ground around the turn, and gained ground between horses in late stretch. ANGELIC STORM chased the leader on
the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, moved up the challenge from the two path headed into the turn, dueled outside from there, and folded in
the final strides. MIRACLE MISCHIEF raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, improved
position on the outside down the lane and finished evenly. PRINCESS PUP chased the leader between horses in the early going, began to drop back while
racing in the two path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and continued to tire from there. PENNY ANGEL trailed the field the entire way
around the oval, saved ground and was never a threat.

STEAL SUNSHINE settled off the early pace between foes, advanced three and four wide around the turn, took over leaving the quarter pole, angled in and
drew off under left-handed urging. BOB MARCO had early speed between foes, plummeted to the rear of the field despite strong urging nearing the far turn,
raced four wide around the bend, re-engaged nearing the lane and was up for the place in the final strides. IT'S NOT EASY set the pace along the rail, was
collared nearing the lane, was no match for the winner and lost second late. KHOPILOT saved ground and failed to menace. SENSEI LAWRENCE
stumbled at the start, pressed the pace two wide and retreated after the six furlongs. GLORY AND VICTORY stalked the pace three wide and came up
empty in the lane. BIRDNOTE was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
BIPARTISANSHIP (GB) was unhurried early inside, waited for an opening still on hold around the far turn, attempted to get through inside LADY
SPEIGHTSPEARE into the stretch but was stymied when that one came over in front of her, remained bottled up through the furlong grounds, found a seam
in deep stretch and responded gamely to get up between horses. STUNNING PRINCESS saved ground in midpack early, swung five wide coming off the
far turn, and kicked in willingly just outside the winner. LADY SPEIGHTSPEARE jumped tracks twice through the stretch the first time, was nursed along
setting an even pace for six furlongs, drifted out several paths brushing and carrying TOBYS HEART wide at the top of the stretch, came back inward in
front of BIPARTISANSHIP once straightened away, retook the lead outside MADEMOISELLE NOVA past the eighth-pole, and was outkicked from there
inside the top two. BREAKER OF CHAINS trailed early inside, moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and rallied with good energy outside. GLADYS
tracked outside the pacesetters for six furlongs, and faded. INTHEWINNERSCIRCLE went along in the second flight two to three wide, fanned out wider to
the lane and could not threaten. MADEMOISELLE NOVA hugged the rail close up from the start, rallied through an ample opening to grab a short lead into
upper stretch, then weakened through the late stages. TOBYS HEART pressed LADY SPEIGHTSPEARE from outside, got brushed and carried out by that
rival at the top of the stretch, and faded. DREAM ABOUT ME stayed in range for a half-mile two to three wide, and retired. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
GALT saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, switched to the
outside to launch a bid entering the stretch and took over on the outside from there. WINIT raced in the four path around the first turn, chased the leaders on
the outside up the backstretch, began a bid while racing in the two path passing the three eighths pole, gained ground entering the stretch, could not go with
the winner late and chased that rival home, the best of the rest. OVERLANDER led the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the
backstretch, dueled from the rail around the far turn and into the stretch, gave way in the final sixteenth of a mile and finished evenly. HALFMOON bumped
with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled between
horses around the far turn and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly. OUTPERFORM raced three wide around the first turn, chased the leaders
between horses up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path racing around the far turn and was outkicked from there. NEVER CHANGE saved ground
around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and made no bid.
POSEIDON'S SON brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, trailed the field from the two path through the opening half mile, began to move
up while saving ground around the far turn and passed tiring horses down the lane while never threatening. STRONG LIGHT raced in the four and five path
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, angled in to race in the two path around the far turn and came up empty from
there. PACO'S PICO bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced into traffic while running in the three path around the first turn, came up
the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the three path and faded in the final quarter of a mile. SILVER MATT
hopped up and brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace
on the outside began to drop back while racing in the three path around the far turn, tired further in the stretch and was vanned off after the gallop out.

Footnotes
AMERICAN ICON broke sharply, rated along showing the way in the two-path to the end of the turn, kicked away when roused into the stretch, and was
merely flashed the crop through the last eighth of a mile. RED LINE OVERDRIVE broke in bumping CASH EXPRESS, advanced three wide after a
half-mile, got closest to the leader turning for home, could not threaten and saved the place. HAPPY BOY ROCKET broke inward and was slow into stride,
raced well back three to four wide, rallied through upper stretch and narrowly missed second outside. WOLFE COUNTY hit the right side of the gate coming
out, then was jostled back and forth between URANIUM and CASH EXPRESS a stride later, moved off the inside around the turn, and went by tired horses
through the last furlong. DOMINICAN ICE pursued the pacesetter between horses for a half-mile, and faded steadily. HARD FROST hit the left side of the
gate coming out and was also bothered by HAPPY BOY ROCKET at a cost of several lengths, and never got close. CASH EXPRESS was bumped between
horses at the start, and retired early. URANIUM bumped with WOLFE COUNTY at the start, was hemmed in along the rail in pursuit of AMERICAN ICON
early, and tired through the stretch on his left lead.

YAMATO raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two path,
launched a bid entering the stretch, and gained ground on the outside down the lane to wear down his rival in the final strides. LIGHT FURY raced in the two
path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began a bid from the two path passing the three eighths
pole, dueled down the stretch and gave way late. SURF AND TURF brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the
first turn, came up the backstretch off the pace between horses, continued around the far turn in the three path, cut in entering the stretch and gained
ground steadily to the wire. MID DAY IMAGE brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in to
chase the leaders up the backstretch, began a bid while saving ground around the far turn, raced in contention in upper stretch and gave way in the final
sixteenth of a mile. ATTENTIVE reared and unseated his rider just prior to the start, broke well and saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the
backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch. OUTRAGEOUS BET saved ground around the first turn, raced in
the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and weakened on the rail in the final furlong.
BENEFACTOR dueled for the lead from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and faded in the stretch.
SIR SEAMUS bobbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to
drop back from the rail while racing around the far turn and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
NEVER SURPRISED set the pace along the rail, drew off around the far turn and widened while ridden out. YES THIS TIME raced well back while two wide
between foes, went three wide between around the far turn, appeared to get bumped near the quarter pole, found clear sailing outside in upper stretch,
closed outside and was up for the place on the wire. SAFE CONDUCT settled off the pace inside, tipped two wide in upper stretch, moved up between foes
and just missed second. HOT BLOODED bumped with SCARLETT SKY at the start, was in range two wide, swung eighth wide turning for home and lacked
the needed rally. SCARLETT SKY was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide, swung widest turning for home and improved position. SIGILOSO
steadied early, saved ground in midpack, went two wide between foes around the far turn, appeared to bump YES THIS TIME nearing the quarter pole,
angled out in upper stretch then came out again late and bumped FIGHTING FORCE nearing the wire. FIGHTING FORCE went evenly while racing two
and three wide and was bumped in deep stretch. GREY STREAK failed to menace while racing two wide. IN EFFECT hit the starting gate, saved ground,
steadied midway down the backstretch and again nearing the quarter pole and lacked a rally. KING OF DREAMS stalked the pace from the rail and came
up empty. MOHS played no factor while racing three and four wide. LAMPLIGHTER JACK pressed the winner two wide and retreated through the lane.
RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
MACK was never far back, ranged up three wide to challenge for command outside rivals midway on the far turn, battled inside MIGHTY TOUGH while
drifting out steadily through a long drive, and narrowly prevailed. MIGHTY TOUGH bumped with BYE BYE DAVID at the start, raced in the second flight four
wide for six furlongs, bid outside MACK into the stretch, and was edged to the finish while being floated out. SIR TERRE lagged well back outside for six
furlongs, shifted widest rallying to loom a threat approaching the furlong grounds, but flattened out late. BYE BYE DAVID bumped with MIGHTY TOUGH at
the start, advanced four wide under a drive on the far turn, but could not sustain the rally. PANENKA pursued CHIEFICIA from outside up the backstretch,
bid for the lead between that one and MACK on the far turn, but faded through the stretch. KANITHAPPEN hit the left side of the gate and came out two
lengths slow, trailed for six furlongs, then passed only tired horses. EVER CLEAR saved ground to the far turn, fanned five wide into the lane, and tired.
CHIEFICIA sped clear early, got overhauled by rivals midway on the far turn, and folded up. CONGRATS AGAIN raced in striking range two wide for six
furlongs, and tired. NEVERENOUGHCOCO was outrun inside.
