KANDI SPUN set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off through the lane with complete authority.
LADY JADE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished with a belated bid to gain the place.
APPEARTOTRUST pressed the pace while racing three-wide and finished with some late run. RANDOM PLEASURE was off a step slow, raced unhurried
early, saved ground through the second turn, reached a contending position but failed to gain late. RATIONAL chased the leaders while racing two-wide and
weakened.

TICK TOCK showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, reached the fore inside the furlong marker and drew off. FINISHED MY P H D dueled
for the lead while racing three-wide, could not match strides with the winner through the final furlong but finished well to hold the place. COSMIC TRIPSTER
broke sharply to race just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. MORNING BLURS was away in good
order to dispute the pace from off the rail and weakened through the final furlong.

Footnotes
MR. PICKLES stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command with a sixteenth to run and edged away late. THETRAILERGUY
broke sharply to duel for the lead with GORDY'S RULES while racing three-wide, vied with that foe into deep stretch but could not resist the winner late.
GORDY'S RULES was away in good order to dispute the pace from the inside and gave way through the final sixteenth. GABO'S MACONDO was reserved
off the leaders from the inside, raced in tight quarters into the stretch and failed to gain late. DYF showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the
second turn and finished evenly late. BOB'S ALL IN lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and showed
late interest. OUR DANDY'S BOY was fractious in the gate, chased the leaders while racing four-wide ,moved up to engage nearing the quarter and
weakened in the drive. INTIMIDATING was void of early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not menace.

FULL OF GRACE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and was up in the final jump. HARKING broke sharply to set a
pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by WITH THATBEINGSAID nearing the quarter, vied with that rival but could not hold the
winner off late to miss by the narrowest of margin. SENORADIABLO showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run
and finished with good energy. NAT GIO lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with good energy. WITH THATBEINGSAID
pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid approaching the stretch and gave way in the drive. MY FIRST PEARL bobbled at the
start, lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. REIGN OF FIRE chased the leaders from between foes, steadied nearing
the seven-sixteenths pole and weakened.

Footnotes
MYSTIC REALITY sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, increased his margin into the stretch and held off the closing TAKE
CHARGE DEPUTY to prevail. TAKE CHARGE DEPUTY was off a step slow, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out
further into the stretch and finished with good late energy. DOODLE TIME was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and
finished with some late run. VICENTE'S SHADOW raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid.
MARKET KING chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. CROOKED FINGER RAY chased the leaders from the
inside and weakened after going a half. AZEE RULES was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
STARS OF BLUEGRASS stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, lugged out from the quarter pole to wire and came back to prevail in the closing yards.
SILLY NOTION was reserved just off the leaders early, was carried out by the winner into the stretch, angled in soon after, led late and could not hold the
winner safe. CHICKS DIG MUNNY pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole and gave way in the
drive. WISHFUL WON showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. WINTER STAR was off slow, raced
unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. EBB AND FLOW settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing
the quarter and failed to rally. LUCKY STEPPER set a pressured pace from the inside and weakened after going three-quarters. AQUINAS lacked early
foot, saved ground through the second turn and did not menace.
