Footnotes
TENGO SED sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace and was ridden out to be kept to task. ELLIE THE NURSE broke
sharply to chase the winner while racing four-wide, was no match for that rival but finished with a steady bid to gain the place. GATO SICILIANO was away
in good order to chase the winner from off the rail throughout and failed to gain on that foe in the drive. PRAYFORTATERS was forwardly placed from the
inside throughout and lacked the needed closing response. QUIRKY CHAOS settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished
evenly late. ATTORNEY LOUIS was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SURFER BLAKE was off slow, raced
three-wide through the turn and lagged throughout.

Footnotes
FIRE WHEN READY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up five-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied CANDY WOMPUS and proved best
through a stiff drive. CANDY WOMPUS pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up offer a bid nearing the three-eighths pole, vied with the winner
but could not hold that rival safe. TOP OF THE GAME showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady bid. MY
COWBOY set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by CANDY WOMPUS nearing the three-eighths marker and gave way
in the drive. PERFECT COME BACK settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. PAPER BOY was void of
early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. REDACTION raced off the pacesetters throughout and gradually weakened.

GIVE A LITTLE was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by CLUB MESQUITE nearing quarter,
disposed of that rival into the lane, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and drew off. CLUB MESQUITE was reserved just off the leaders early,
moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter but could not match strides with the winner in the drive. HIGH FLYIN TIGER settled off the leaders
early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly in the drive. WHISPERING FLAME raced off the pacesetters early, saved ground
through the second turn and lacked the needed rally. ATLATL showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. EL
MARIACHI showed brief speed, weakened and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
MO GEE tracked the pace of SAND WALKER from the inside, angled out into the stretch and wore that rival down in the closing yards. SAND WALKER was
away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin into the lane, remained in control through mid-stretch and yielded to the
winner late. BRETT settled off the leaders early, moved up from the inside to reach a contending position and failed to gain late. MARQUE IT UP was
forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. TOP ROCKET raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide
through the turn and lacked the needed rally. RED MAMBA pressed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half. PLANET NINE lacked
early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. PREMIER LEAGUE was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved from off the rail through the
turn and did not offer a bid. PAPA'S HONEY was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not threaten.

in slightly in mid-stretch, bumped with rival and was up in the closing yards. IMPERATOR settled off the leaders early, dropped back nearing the
three-eighths marker, drifted out in mid-stretch to bump with rival, was quickly straightened away and finished with good energy. SEATTLE SEE YA was
away in good order to duel for the lead while racing three-wide and gave way grudgingly in the drive. TALKIN MALICE raced off the pacesetters throughout
and failed to threaten. SWAGSATIONAL showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn, reached a contending position but failed to gain
late. ROLL OUT was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the second turn, steadied in mid-stretch and gave way thereafter. FORT YORK lacked

Footnotes
CAPTAIN RED lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew clear. BALIUS was away in
good order to dispute the pace from the inside, could not match strides with the winner in the drive but finished well to hold the place. BODEGA was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, reached the leaders with a furlong to run and gave way in the drive.
ACHILLEUS lagged early, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished with a belated bid. THEY'RE GRRREAT was off slow, lugged out through
the first turn, moved up to take command before going a quarter, opened a clear margin and weakened after going three-quarters. EXETER chased the
leaders while racing four-wide and gradually weakened.
