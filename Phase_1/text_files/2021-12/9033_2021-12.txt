Footnotes
GLANCE was reluctant to load, stalked the clear pace setter from the outside while being that one's closest pursuant, crept closer into the far turn to bid for
the lead turning for home, forged an advantage passing the quarter pole, inched clear in midstretch as SUNDAY SCHEMING chased, then held well from a
rallying rival through the final furlong. ANGEL OF VERDUN stalked along the inside, shifted off of the rail to chase a clearing GLANCE through upper
stretch, outkicked an outer rival while taking aim on the leader leaving the furlong grounds, steadily grinded away at that foe's advantage, but did not have
enough to catch her. SUNDAY SCHEMING settled off of the pace while caught three wide around both turns, produced a good turn of foot after shifting four
wide entering the lane, ranged up to a leading GLANCE approaching the furlong grounds, but flattened out at that junction, failed to keep pace leaving that
marking, and got outkicked by an inner foe for place shortly after, but held show late. HAVINFUNYET saved ground off of the pace, shifted five wide
approaching midstretch, and moved up late without threatening. QUINN ELLA tracked the pace two wide, tipped three wide entering the lane, but was
outkicked by an outer foe in upper stretch, altered course outside of that foe in midstretch, but lacked a kick therafter. NORTHERN ALLIANCE laid at the
rear two wide, got floated six wide in upper stretch, and failed to factor. SERIOUSLY SASSY set a clear pace around the first turn, but met the eventual
winner's bid around the far turn, got headed at the quarter pole, and faded on herleft lead.

Footnotes
ZION was fractious loading, but did so rider-less, then hopped at the start, quickly recovered to press the pace three wide, drifted to the four path turning for
home as COACH KENNY ranged up, but inched closer in the process, bid the quarter pole, assumed command at the three sixteenths pole, and drew off
under driving pressure. COACH KENNY chased four wide, got floated to the five path by ZION while inching closer turning for home, but failed to keep pace
with that rival in upper stretch, stayed on to bid for place at the furlong grounds, and secured that position. YOAKAM vied two wide early on, pressed his
inner counterpart into the turn, then from between horses around the bend, but was outkicked by an outer rival turning for home, chased from between
horses thereafter and caught the tiring early pace setter for show late. LOUISIANA THUNDER broke a step slowly, rushed to set the pace along the inside,
dug in to meet ZION's bid at the quarter pole, but proved no match for that foe at the three sixteenths marker, and weakened. MONEY AND ME stalked
along the inside, but failed to produce a bid. BARREL OF BOURBON was void of early speed, took the turn in the two path while very far off of the pace,
lugged outwardly in upper stretch, and raced greenly through the final furlong while veering from correction. OUR SEXY A. P. broke well, but was quickly
outpaced, and showed little.

Footnotes
CHEYANN GLITTERS bobbled into an outer foe at the start but was not costed position, dueled for the lead two wide, drifted a few paths outwardly turning
for home, but straightened entering the lane, assumed command at the three sixteenths pole, and drew off. LOOKING HOT was void of early speed, tucked
to the rail into the turn, shifted two wide entering the lane, rallied between horses in midstretch, and sustained her charge to reach place in the late stages.
SAVANNAH'S HERE was bumped by an inner foe at the start, rushed inside of a pair of foes after a furlong to duel for the lead, vied inside of CHEYANN
GLITTERS around the bend, but gave way to that foe at the three sixteenths pole, faded, and lost place in the closing stages. HUSHED COURT ROOM
stalked the dueling trio early on, chased the leading pair two wide around the turn while under a drive, drifted a bit outwardly in upper stretch while
sustaining his chase, but failed to produce a bid. RECKLESS SERGEANT was pinched back between horses early on causing him to trail the field around
the bend, then rallied between horses while improving through the final furlong. MISS LAUGHALOT took the turn in the four path while far off of the pace,
and never got involved. SWEET JACKIELEIGH bumped an outer foe at the start, tracked along the inside, but faded turning for home.
SAYANOTHERPRAYER got bumped by an inner foe at the start, vied outside of that rival early on, but failed to keep pace with her and an inner contender
into the turn, and folded in upper stretch. ABSOLUTELY MINDY chased from well off of the pace in the three path around the turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
VINCITORE rated off of the pace two to three wide around the turns, tipped six wide entering the lane, rallied outside of foes to drive past the tiring leader at
the sixteenth pole, and cleared. EAST LEX rushed the gate just before it opened, then hopped slightly at the start without being costed position, settled far
off of the pace in the two path, trailed into the far turn, then swung six to seven wide in upper stretch, and rallied through the final furlong while chasing
VINCITORE to reach place in the late stages. OKUDAH was bumped between horses at the start, pressed three wide early on, ranged up to bid at the half
mile pole, vied two wide around the far turn, cleared while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, but tired late, and was bested a sixteenth from home.
WE NEED A FIVE stalked two wide and from between horses, but was outmoved by an outer foe into the far turn, chased the leading pair from the outside
around that bend, sustained chasing position into the final furlong while in pursuit of OKUDAH, but faltered in the final sixteenth. NO KA OI was bumped an
knocked off stride by an inner foe at the start, tracked four wide, tipped five wide entering the lane, but was outkicked by outer foes approaching midstretch,
and kept on in the final furlong. QUIET PRAYER took bumps from both sides at the start, stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase from between
horses through the lane. BIG POWER RED hopped slightly at the start and was slow into stride, settled off of the pace along the inside, then two wide
around the far turn, shifted to six path in midstretch while behind rivals, and failed to factor. ONE HITTER broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start,
trailed along the inside, advanced inside of foes down the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, attempted to split rivals two wide approaching
midstretch, but steadied when that door shut at the furlong grounds. HOG WILD reared in the gate, set the pace, vied inside of a bidding rival into the far
turn, got headed turning for home, and weakened in upper stretch. KILLER BEE was hung out five wide around both turns while off of the pace, and got
outrun.

Footnotes
TOUCHDOWN JOE stalked four wide around the turn, ranged up along with his stablemate to bid for the lead at the furlong pole, dueled with that rival
through the late stages, and prevailed. MR ELVIN pressed the pace along the inside early on, stalked into the turn, tipped two wide while inside of his
stablemate entering the lane, bid along with that foe at the furlong grounds, battled gamely thereafter, but was outdueled. DUVEE hopped and brushed the
gate at the start, sat far off of the pace along the inside around the turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch, rallied while shifting inwardly in midstretch, and
reached an outer rival on the wire to dead heat for show. INTHEALY broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, showed speed between horses before
clearing an inner foe into the turn, showed the way from the two path around the bend, but lugged outwardly while meeting the entry's bid in midstretch,
proved no match for them at the furlong grounds, tired thereafter, but held show via a dead heat. ADIEU LE CHAT laid off of the pace two wide around the
turn, and failed to factor. BATTLE OF WILL tracked from midpack five wide and outside of foes around the turn, then failed to menace through the lane.
DOCTRINAIRE saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. BLUE SKY FLASH was bumped by an inner foe at the start, chased from midpack four wide
and between horses, but faded at the three furlong pole, then drifted outwardly turning for home and in upper stretch. DOUBLE YOU was put to tight
quarters between horses at the start, prompted the pace three wide, but weakened between horses turning for home. CYRANO DE was outrun.

Footnotes
TRIPLE TIARA broke a beat slowly, settled off of the pace two wide, tipped four wide entering the lane, grinded away into midstretch to bid passing the
furlong pole, drove clear passing the sixteenth pole, and held from a rallying rival to the wire. MAXINE MACHINE rated off of the pace along the inside,
shifted six wide in upper stretch, and rallied well through the final furlong, but ran out of ground to catch the leader. SWEET N SASSY broke inwardly,
tracked along the inside, but lacked a kick to split foes two wide in upper stretch, shifted in passing the furlong pole for clear sailing, and chased to reach
show on the wire. YIN YANG sped clear, tugged while widening her advantage down the backstretch, but came back to the field turning for home, dug in to
resist bidding rivals through upper stretch, but was bested by an outer rival at the sixteenth pole, and lost show late. MYSTIQUE SABOTEUR stalked the
clear leader from the outside, closed in on that rival along with other foes turning for home, bid in upper stretch, led briefly, but faltered between horses at
the furlong grounds. BOXING DAY tracked two, ranged up three wide turning for home, but was outkicked in midstretch, and flattened out. CANDY RAID
broke a step slowly, and got outrun.

Footnotes
TRAFALGAR vied two wide, drove clear at the three sixteenths pole, dug in as NAVAL AVIATOR loomed a danger approaching the final sixteenth, drifted
outwardly to meet that foe's bid, brushed that rival while maintaining a narrow advantage, and gamely held while receiving that rival's counter bump on the
wire. NAVAL AVIATOR settled off of the pace two wide, gained between horses turning for home to take aim on the leading pair, tipped three wide at the
furlong grounds before surging to bid outside of TRAFALGAR a sixteenth from home, got brushed by that drifting foe while battling, then returned the favor
by bumping that rival on the wire while being fended off. WE ALL SEE IT set the pace while feeling stern pressure from TRAFALGAR, resisted that foe
entering the lane, but was bested at the three sixteenths pole, and gave way. BLOODLINE stalked three wide, pressed from between horses at the five
furlong pole, but chased the dueling pair around the far turn before tiring in upper strech. BEST OF CUPID stalked four wide, crept closer to press at the five
furlong pole, tucked three wide and behind rivals into the far turn, but faded around that bend. FORMAL ORDER saved ground off of the pace, but faded
turning for home.

Footnotes
ROBINHILL broke sharply and quickly crossed over, set the pace along the inside, held sway from a chasing GILLIAN ELIZABETH through upper stretch,
inched away from at for passing the furlong pole, then held safely from a rallying rival late. ABOUKIR BAY stalked two wide around the turn, tipped three
wide in upper stretch, grinded away while chasing ROBINHILL through midstretch, produced a late kick in the final sixteenth, but did not have enough to
catch the leader. GILLIAN ELIZABETH pressed ROBINHILL from the outside, chased that foe into midstretch, but tired in the late stages. THE GREY
BEAUTY tracked along the inside, shifted outwardly in midstretch, and stayed on for a minor share. LUCK IS FICKLE stalked two wide early on, tucked to
the rail into the turn, but only managed to chase the leaders through upper stretch, and faded without bidding. ZEN (IRE) laid off of the pace in the four path
around the turn, and failed to factor. COLORS OF THE WIND rated off of the pace along the inside, but never got involved. SPOOKY ROAD broke slowly,
took the turn in the four to five path while far off of the pace, and made little impact. SPARKLING WATER also broke slowly without incident, tracked from
midpack four wide, tucked three wide into the turn, but faded turning for home. SARATOGA PASODOBLE trailed along the inside, and was outrun.

Footnotes
G'S SQUEEZE broke through the starting gate pre-race, then set the pace along the inside, drew off at the quarter pole, and widened under driving
pressure. RUE LALA stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the leader entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with her in upper stretch while claiming
place, then held that position. MAW MAW'S SOPHIA gained from off of the pace four to five wide turning for home, then stayed on in pursuit of RUE LALA
for place, but did not have enough to catch that foe. STEPH'S SPIRIT saved ground while tracking around the turn, but only managed to chase through the
lane. PHILLY WINS tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with those foes at the three furlong pole, but kept on
through the lane. PEACEFUL VISION took the turn in the three path while far off of the pace, and improved between horses through the final furlong.
LUCKY GONE SWEET tracked from midpack three wide, came into the lane four wide and between horses, but was shuffled back behind a stopping MRS.
JUDY in upper stretch, shifted course outwardly while hanging on her left lead, and lacked a rally. VERRAZANO ISLAND was slow into stride, settled at the
rear along the inside, and never got involved. TREFOIL was outsprinted early on, and got outrun. SPEAK TO ME laid off of the pace, swung six wide
entering the lane, but faltered. MRS. JUDY pressed the pace two wide, but weakened entering the lane, and stopped.
