FACTOR IN stalked the pace down the backstretch and on the turn, circled foes four deep on the turn, gained a short lead in upper stretch, was under brisk
urging and drew off. CLOSERTOTHEHEART , close up down the backstretch, offered a three path bid between horses turning for home then faded. WHO
KNOWS WHAT lacked speed, was in the two path on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside rivals. GHOST MAIDEN prompted
the pace two wide around the turn and weakened in mid stretch. GETTING LUCKY , three deep on the turn, failed to rally. POSITIVE POWER , along the
inner rail down the backstretch and on the turn, failed to be a factor. CHICAGO RIVER showed speed along the inner rail and gave way. FORTES , well
placed along the inner rail down the backstretch, gave way.

HIT A HOMER HONEY edged up five wide outside rivals nearing the half mile marker, quickly gained four wide to take a stalking spot leaving the three
eighths, bid outside DIAL ME MAYBE near the quarter pole, secured command soon into the lane, kicked clear under strong handling in mid stretch then
steadily widened while kept to task. DIAL ME MAYBE , with the pace between foes, held a short lead into the turn, handled pressure from both sides
nearing the quarter pole, failed to kick on with the winner in mid stretch but kept on well to be clear for the place. HELIACAL RISING settled off the pace and
off the rail, made a decent four wide run from the three eighths into the lane took closer order with a furlong to go but failed to seriously sustain. HOLY PINK
, four wide between runners nearing the half mile pole, chased off the rail mid turn, shifted out past the three sixteenths but failed to make a late impact.
SAFE REEZAN had speed to lead early, was headed from her outside heading to the half mile marker, stayed on to duel around the turn, failed to keep
pace leaving the three sixteenths and weakened. IRISH CHAOS had speed and tracked early from the inside, was under asking around the turn and faded.
CIVIL UNREST , between rivals early on, gave pursuit three to four wide into the lane but failed to generate a solid late kick. SISTER JUNE , edged up four
wide early, forced the pace three wide outside the dueling leaders past the three eighths, failed to kick on into the lane then gave way. LA REINA SUSAN
stumbled at the break and was off slow, saved ground off the pace, eased out into the lane but failed to menace. HELLO JAMROCK saved ground drafting
back off the pace, was shuffled into the turn, angled out and gave way.

FAST CASH lacked speed, circled rivals on the turn, was four deep entering the stretch, drifted in when sprinting clear in mid stretch then was kept to his
business in the drive. NO MORE TALK chased the pace while three wide entering the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and offered a slight rally.
GETOFFMYBACK hugged the inner rail, prompted the pace and faded. GOODLUCKCHUCK stumbled soon after the break, rushed up outside horses
leaving the backstretch, gained a three wide lead on the turn and tired turning for home. CHRISATUDE , wide on the turn, was no factor. HARD FOUGHT
showed speed in the two path for five furlongs and faltered.

Footnotes
MAID THE JOURNEY settled well back off of a hotly contested pace, commenced a run off the rail leaving the far turn, circled five wide into the lane, leveled
off under left handed asking past the three sixteenths, sustained nicely, took command outside CRYING FOR MORE in deep stretch and edged away.
CRYING FOR MORE settled outside a rival as the duel developed up front, cruised up four wide into the lane, took command outside rivals soon after,
responded to asking and kicked clear, kept on willingly but could not contain the winner's charge. BOONDOGGLE , forwardly placed inside early on,
steadied along when shuffled back from the five eighths to about the half mile marker, regrouped and angled out advancing past the five sixteenths,
continued progress four wide to mid stretch then flattened out. ONE MORE FACTOR prompted the pace two to three wide outside CRACK THE SAFE,
moved to near even terms into the turn, sparred around the turn and held a slim lead nearing the stretch, stayed willingly to mid stretch then weakened late.
PANNA MINE saved ground in range of the duelers, gained past the five sixteenths, eased out with aim into the lane, drifted in and faded. SUPER E , urged
off the pace and off the inside, failed to respond. CRACK THE SAFE took over early, set a pressured pace towards the inside, battled with ONE MORE
FACTOR from the far turn to upper stretch then gave way. MAXIMO STRONG lagged off the pace, saved ground and failed to menace. DREAMING OF
CARATS bobbled at the break, forced the early pace five wide outside rivals, chased four wide leaving the three eighths and gave way. BILLINGSGATE
gave early chase between foes and faltered.

Footnotes
MI CLEOPATRA AND I saved ground on the turn, was taken to the three path in upper stretch, angled back to the inner rail in mid stretch, closed inside
horses and was up late. SAMMIE SUNSHINE showed speed along the rail, disputed the pace to the stretch, angled out in upper stretch, held a clear lead in
mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. WICKED JANE raced between horses most of the trip and had a mild rally. JOYFUL NOISE advanced three deep on
the turn to challenge for the lead and failed to sustain her move. VOLADOR circled horses on the turn, was four deep entering the stretch and lacked the
necessary late response. PRINCESS GEORGIA , wide on the turn, was outrun. THUNDERTURTLE , along the inner rail on the turn, angled out turning for
home and failed to be a factor. PARCHED GHOST was not a factor. NYMUE'S TREASURE was outrun. TWEET AWAY ROBIN disputed the pace outside
SAMMIE SUNSHINE, failed to keep up leaving the turn, steadied in close quarters near the eighth pole and was eased late.

Footnotes
SPANIKOPITA , taken to rate soon after an alert break, tracked a contested pace three wide, moved to the attack nearing the quarter pole, gained
command near the three sixteenths, kicked away under a drive soon after then held firm while kept to task. ISLAND PHILO , off the pace four wide, was
under coaxing and picked up momentum mid turn, circled six wide into the stretch and closed willingly. SUMMER ODDS chased the leaders four wide, took
closer order after a half mile, had aim past the three sixteenths but flattened out late. BIRTHDAY WISH chased the pace four wide and came up empty.
COLOROFACLOUD , jostled at the break, rushed up between rivals nearing the turn, came three wide for the drive but lacked a solid finish. ABOVE MINE
was sent up early to join the pace fray, vied outside DUART CASTLE, took over past the three eighths, could not fend off the winner in upper stretch, stayed
willingly too mid stretch then weakened. BELLSWILLBERINGING , bumped at the break, moved up two wide between foes into the lane but failed to
sustain. MY FLICKER , four to five wide, was not a factor. RONA came in at the break and bumped a rival, raced off the pace and three wide, was under
asking into the lane and failed to menace. NOT NOW DONALD broke slowly, edged up early on, saved ground pursuing past the three eighths and faded.
DUART CASTLE rushed up inside, set a pressured pace, ceded command mid turn then tired past the five sixteenths.

lacked speed, was four wide on the turn and rallied outside the winner. BLUEBERRY INDYGO showed speed, raced along the inner rail around the turn and
faded in the drive. ISABELLA'S GLORY lacked speed, raced wide around the turn and passed tired foes. CIRCLE HOME , never a factor, passed tired
rivals. ALWAYS MIA , a forward factor four deep on the turn, weakened in upper stretch. MY SISTER CLURRIE , no factor, raced wide entering the stretch.
MISS FOXANN showed speed in the two path and gave way on the turn. LOVE SAGA raced along the inner rail and gave way on the turn. SATISFIED was

MIT MAZEL leaned in at the break bumping a rival and was away last, corrected and rushed up five wide into the first turn, moved clear soon after, set the
pace off the inside, was coaxed along widening leaving the far turn, drifted out nearing mid stretch, was corrected with right handed stick work and held firm.
RUNAWAY MONET , forwardly placed around the first turn, raced three wide between foes past the five eighths, chased three wide outside foes leaving the
three eighths, emerged as the closest pursuer past the three sixteenths and held well. SWEET HOME DIXIE saved ground advancing near the five eighths,
chased inside foes past the five sixteenths then flattened out a bit late while saving the show. GOOD MEASURE , unhurried early while saving ground,
angled out under a ride past the five sixteenths and churned on with interest. AWARD WANTED tugged her way forward past the three quarter pole, was
caught between runners pursuing from the half to the five sixteenths and tired. REINA LA KELSY lagged far back, swung out nearing the lane and failed to
menace. TAYLER'S CHROME had speed towards the inside, chased the five eighths, faltered and was eased late. GOLD FINCH , bumped at the break,
was used four wide to contention, lost ground five wide past the five eighths, faltered then was eased through the drive.

Footnotes
TORCH CARRIER showed speed near the rail down the backstretch, was deftly eased outside leaving the backstretch, moved up three wide on the turn,
secured command in upper stretch then drew away under steady handling. MY SUPER SALLY lacked speed, was eight deep entering the stretch and
rallied. AREEMAA raced in the six path leaving the turn and finished willingly. BLESS AND HONOR , in the seven path turning for home, passed tired foes.
OFFLEE GRAYSFUL , wide on the turn, was checked in close quarters near the sixteenth pole. WRITTENBYTHESTARS sprinted clear leaving the
backstretch, set the pace in the two path around the turn and weakened in the drive. AMERICAS WOMAN , bumped leaving the starting gate, raced inside
horses on the turn and weakened. NOTION INTERRUPTUS was not a factor. WINDRUSH KARMA , four wide on the turn, weakened. GYPSY'S IMAGE
bore out leaving the starting gate, chased the pace racing along the inner rail and gave way. DIGITAL DREAM bobbled at the break, raced inside horses
and gave way. TUFF BUT FAIR , outrun, was eased late.
