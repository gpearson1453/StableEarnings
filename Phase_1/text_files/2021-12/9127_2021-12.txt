Footnotes
KITTENOFTHE COURT broke outwardly, cleared into the first turn, met LANGFUHR'S ANGEL's bid at the three furlong pole, but gamely repelled that foe in
upper stretch, inched clear, and held sway to the wire. LANGFUHR'S ANGEL stalked two wide, bid for the lead passing the three furlong pole, vied turning
for home, but was turned away in upper stretch while hanging on her left lead, fought on thereafter, but failed to regain even terms. I DONT KNOW EITHER
stalked the leading pair from along the inside, but only managed to chase them through the lane, and was best of the rest. SAFE KEEPING trailed along the
inside, shifted to the five path approaching midstretch while hanging on her left lead, and moved up late. LUCKY HARBORAGE settled off of the pace along
the inside, and failed to factor. GRACE'S GAL broke inwardly and was off slowly, tracked the pace two wide, but weakened entering the lane. ST MARIA
laid far back two wide, and was outrun.

Footnotes
FROSTERIA bumped an outer foe at the start, the took up between horse early on when BLESSING THE FLAG crossed over, tracked three wide, ranged
up around the turn, but hung on her left lead while taking aim on a clear AUNT JOIE in upper stretch, drifted outwardly in the process passing the three
sixteenths pole, but shifted back inwardly while switching leads approaching the furlong grounds, completed a bid passing that marker, then kicked clear
and held from a rallying FLATTER ME SILLY late. FLATTER ME SILLY tracked the leading group from the two to three path around the turn, tipped four
wide entering the lane, grinded away outside of foes through midstretch, before producing a late kick approaching the final sixteenth, but was kept at bay by
the leader. AUNT JOIE set the pace along the inside, shook clear from a pressing rival entering the lane, but was tested by FOSTERIA passing the furlong
pole, got headed a sixteenth out, gave way, but saved show. LOVERS QUARREL stalked two wide, then from between horses into the turn, shifted three
wide entering the lane, aimed to rally between horses approaching the final furlong, but was shut off when FROSTERIA came across her path passing that
marker, took up to alter course outwardly, then kept on, but missed reaching a tiring AUNT JOIE for show on the wire. BLESSING THE FLAG stalked along
the inside, but only managed to chase the leaders though the lane, and failed to produce a bid. TURF DANCER laid off of the pace along the inside, and
never got involved. JUDY'S DESIGN bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed the field around the turn, and was outrun. MIZ TROUBADOUR hopped at
the start, recovered to press the pace two wide, but faded between horses entering the lane. FOLLOWING A RIDER'S OF LOVERS QUARREL CLAIMED
FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF FROSTERIA FOR INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH, FROSTERIA WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FOURTH.

D'WILD MUFFIN stalked two wide, bid for the lead outside of SAY YES AGAIN at the three furlong pole, led at the five sixteenths marker, inched clear in
upper stretch as ELLA'S LIL STAR gave chase, and held as that foe closed in late. ELLA'S LIL STAR vied along the inside early on before allowing outer
foes to go on passing the half mile pole, stalked along the inside into the turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, grinded away on her left lead to take aim
on a clear D'WILD MUFFIN in the final furlong, but was denied. MANDOLINE STAR laid off of the pace two to three wide, shifted four wide entering the
lane, and surpassed a tiring foe for a minor share without bidding. OMA LEE rated off of the pace three to four wide around the turn, got floated five wide
entering the lane, and failed to factor. SAY YES AGAIN vied two wide, cleared her inner counterpart at the half mile pole, showed the way from a bidding
D'WILD MUFFIN into the turn, but was headed by that foe approaching the five sixteenths pole, then weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
HALEYS SAILOR bumped an inner foe at the start, vied between horses early on before allowing those foes to go on into the first turn, comfortably stalked
the top pair while tipping outside of them down the backstretch, came under urging around the far turn, responded turning for home to produce a bid in
upper stretch, led at the three sixteenths pole, kicked clear in midstretch, and held from a rallying SMOKEY HARBOR late. SMOKEY HARBOR broke a step
slowly before being bumped by an outer foe into an inner rival at the start, settled off of the pace three to two wide, tipped four wide and outside of the
leaders in upper stretch, rallied through the final furlong to take aim on a clear HALEY'S SAILOR, but was denied late. POLICY OPTION settled at the rear,
shifted three to four wide entering the lane, then stayed on while lugging inwardly from right handed pressure, and reached show late. INDY TOURIST vied
for the lead two wide, led at the five sixteenths pole, but was headed by the eventual winner at the three sixteenths pole, and gave way. CANCELLARA was
minorly pushed out by an inner foe before taking a solid bump from an outer foe at the start, tracked along the inside, saved ground around the turns, but
faded turning for home. IMMORTAL broke a bit outwardly, set the pace inside of a vying INDY TOURIST, but got headed at the five sixteenths pole, and
weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
FOOLISH STEVE stalked along the inside around the first turn, tipped outside of the leading pair into the backstretch to produce an early bid for the lead at
the five furlong pole, cleared inner foes soon after as LIKEN IT pressed on, showed the way inside of that foe around the far turn, then drew off from that
rival entering the lane, and was driven home. BOBBY JR. vied two wide early on, but was headed by a pair of outer foes with half a mile to run, chased
those foes from along the inside around the far turn, kept on to regain place in midstretch, and held that position from an outer foe late. TWO MIKES N DOC
G settled off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the three to four path, then stayed on outside of foes through the final furlong, but was denied
reaching place. LIKEN IT tracked three to four wide, bid for the lead along with FOOLISH STEVE at the five furlong pole, vied outside of that rival around the
far turn, but weakened entering the lane. GOTTA A. P. B. was outrun. MISS SVENGAIL pressed along the inside around the first turn, but gave way to outer
foes after a half mile, and weakened thereafter. SAUL GOOD MAN broke a step slowly at the start, and was done early. THE SEVEN FURLONG TIME
WAS OMITTED AND IS PENDING REVIEW.

Footnotes
TOUCH OF CLASS lunged inwardly at the start but quickly recovered to vie along the inside, allowed outer foes to go on into the turn, stalked comfortably
along the inside around the bend, shifted outside of the leading pair entering the lane, forged an advantage at the three sixteenths pole, kicked clear from a
chasing SPARKLE OF HOPE at the furlong grounds, and held to the wire as that foe rallied late. SPARKLE OF HOPE broke slowly while brushing the inner
part of the gate, laid off of the pace, gained three to four wide around the turn before getting floated to the six path entering the lane, shifted inwardly across
SCAMPERING GRAYCE's path before bidding for place and taking aim on clearing TOUCH OF GLASS passing the three sixteenths pole, grinded away at
that foe's advantage in the final furlong, but was denied victory. SUMMER SANGRIA tracked two wide, shifted three wide in upper stretch while hoping to
shift outside of the leading trio, but was denied that path by an inwardly shifting SPARKLE OF HOPE at the three sixteenths pole, got outkicked passing that
marker, kept on thereafter to claim show passing the furlong pole, and held that position from an outer foe late. KARALINKA took the turn far off of the pace
in the two path, shifted to four path entering the lane, then altered to the eight path to be outside of leading foes at the furlong grounds, then stayed on late,
but missed reaching show. COBRA CASABLANCA showed speed between horses early on, cleared an inner foe into the turn while an outer rival pressed
on, vied inside of a group of foes in upper stretch, but yielded passing the three sixteenths pole. PRINCESS STELLA (IRE) vied for the lead three wide, then
two wide around the turn, but weakened between horses at the three sixteenths pole. SCAMPERING GRAYCE chased the leading pair four to there wide
into the turn, drifted to the five path entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer foe in upper stretch, steadied when that rival shifted inwardly at the
three sixteenths pole, and weakened thereafter. MADAME READY saved ground off of the pace, but faded through the lane. LATTE DOLCE was outrun
throughout and showed little.

Footnotes
MADAM HENNY chased along the inside, bumped an outer ZERO POINT ZERO while shifting outside of the leader passing the quarter pole, bid
approaching the furlong marker, and drew off under driving pressure. SKY FACTOR bumped an outer foe at the start, set the pace inside of a vying ZERO
POINT ZERO, shrugged off that rival entering the lane, but met MADAM HONEY's bid at the furlong pole, gave way passing that marker, and was second
best. SPY A STAR took bumps from rivals on either side at the start, trailed the field, then moved up inside of foes through the lane. ZERO POINT ZERO
sparred outside of SKY FACTOR around the turn, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, then was bumped by an inner foe leaving the quarter pole, kept
on thereafter, but lost show to an inner rival late. BROOKLYNN'S DABOMB bumped an inner foe at the start, tracked the pace two wide and between
horses, tipped three wide at the five sixteenths pole, but shied from inner bumping foes in upper stretch, and quickly flattened out. TOTAL MALICE pressed
the leading pair from the outside, but faded after getting floated four wide at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
NEW YEAR'S EVE was squeezed back between horses at the start, settled far off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn three to four wide before
swinging seven wide entering the lane, produced a good kick in midstretch, wore down the leading pair in the final sixteenth, and swept past late. MISSONI
laid in midpack in the two path around the first turn, tracked a bidding TROBAIRITZ three wide around the far turn, tipped four wide entering the lane,
ranged up to bid outside of that foe approaching the furlong grounds, took a brush in the process, but sustained her bid, dueled into the final sixteenth, but
was surpassed by an outer foe late. TROBAIRITZ stalked two to three wide bid entering the lane, led in upper stretch as MISSONI menaced, brushed that
bidding foe at the furlong grounds as a duel ensued, battled into the final sixteenth, but was overhauled by an outer foe late, and got bested for place.
CECILITA hesitated significantly at the start, trailed the field in the two path around both turns, shifted to the three to four path in upper stretch, and rallied
between horses in the final furlong. TREASURE OF WAR was off slowly, tracked along the inside while saving ground, shifted five wide in upper stretch, but
drifted further out in the process, and lacked a kick. GIRLS HOUSE pressed the pace two wide, vied between horses turning for home, but was outkicked by
outer foes in upper stretch, and yielded. MAJESTIC UNION laid off of the pace three to two wide, came into the lane five wide, but lacked a rally. TAP THAT
APP laid far back three wide, improved four wide and outside of foes around the far turn, shifted six wide entering the lane, but flattened out. LADY CLARE
bumped an outer foe at the start, saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. CHARDONNAY bumped an inner foe at the start, stalked along the inside,
chased in the three path through upper stretch, and faltered. LADY JEOPARDY set the pace inside of a pressing GIRLS HOUSE while tucking down from
the four path around the first turn, but yielded to a trio of outer rivals passing the quarter pole. THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED
