Footnotes
EMPRESS DEONA was soon clear to set the early pace, then drew off on the turn, came off the turn in the three path, then maintained big lead to the wire
under a vigorous hand ride and being on her left lead. THE BOSS OF YOU tracked the pace three wide and finished willingly while no match for the winner
but clearly second best. HICKORY DICKORYDOC was allowed to settle early, split rivals at the five sixteenths and was four wide between rivals by the
quarter pole but had no rally in the drive, bested rest. ON ISLAND TIME was well placed early on the inside and weakened. DISCREETLY TOUGH chased
the pace four to five wide and then was empty in the drive.

Footnotes
CALCULATED THINKIN was bumped around the half mile marker while being rated, then steadied around the three eighths pole entering the far turn,
angled in towards the inside, then advanced on the turn, tipped out four wide for aim on the front runners, made a bid and drew clear in the final sixteenth to
prove best under a drive. NEVERLOOKBACK set the early pace and crossed over to the inside, then was headed and dueled for the lead by the quarter
pole, then regained a short advantage by the furlong marker but could not hold off his stable mate late while fighting on to the wire. VICTORY ELEMENT
bobbled at the start, then pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command by the quarter pole but flattened out.
WONDER IN was on the inside, then was trying to lug out by the half mile marker, then was checked repeatedly while on the inside, then lugged out on the
turn and came five wide into the drive and came up empty. LEAP TO GLORY chased the pace four to five wide and weakened. MOBEATYABAD chased
the pace in between rivals and weakened.

Footnotes
KAZ'S PRINCESS pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, took over leaving the turn and drew out in the stretch under
left handed crop urging to prove much the best. LIME SQUASH set a pressured pace in the two path, then was headed by the quarter pole and proved to be
no match for the winner while clearly second best. FALSE RULING was well placed early on the inside and weakened, held show award. NIKKIS KITTEN
was reserved early while three wide by the three eighths pole, then dropped down to the inside and advanced by the quarter pole, then offered a belated
rally on the inside. KASTANYAS was void of early speed, saved ground on the turn and passed the tiring rivals on the inside. VALENTINA'S CUPID lacked
a rally. EMILIA STRONG was settled while three wide early and had no response. SCARLET LILY prompted the pace four wide and stopped. IVY showed
little.

ROYAL SUSPECT was rated along the inside, then shifted out two wide on the turn to go by the tiring pace setter, then closed up the inside to get up in time
under a drive. MOTI stumbled at the start, then was settled five wide on the backstretch, made a four wide move on the far turn, took over leaving the turn
and was clear by the furlong marker, but was headed leaving the sixteenth pole and fought gamely but was denied late, good effort. CHARGING LION
checked into the first turn, then was rated four wide down the backstretch, then was three wide on the far turn, switched to the outside leaving the turn and
closed well but hung late. GINS AND TINS was settled early while two wide, then eased out on the turn and came five wide into the drive and had a mild
late rally. SURE WOULD FOREST prompted the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command, then faded in the drive. AUTOMATE set
the pace from the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
JET FORCE set the early pace while racing in the two path, then drew clear leaving the turn and by the furlong marker, then was kept to right handed
pressure to prove best. BAZINGA C was well placed early from between rivals, then made a three wide bid by the quarter pole, but proved to be no match to
the winner while finishing willingly, second best. ISTHATYOURHARLEY was slow into stride early, then advanced towards the inside on the turn, swung out
three to four wide leaving the turn, then was trying to lug in through the lane and offered a mild rally to gain the show award. DETERMINED TRUTH chased
the pace on the inside and lacked the needed strech bit while just missing the show award. SWEET TALIA was allowed to settle early, then advanced out
the turn and came five wide into the drive and had a belated rally. KILIMANJARA chased the pace four wide, then was three wide by the three sixteenths
and was empty. TEAM HOT LINE broke in at the start, then chased the pace five wide and weakened. PURELY SILVER was bumped at the start, pressed
the pace three wide and stopped.

Footnotes
IAINTFRAIDANOGHOST was well rated while three to four wide, made a bid on the turn, and drew off in the stretch under a few right handed pops with the
crop to prove much the best. MAD FOR FAME chased the pace four to five wide and rallied well late for the place award. MINDING MILLIE pressed the
early pace and made a three wide bid to vie for command on the turn, then weakened in the drive while staying on for the show award.
JOURNEYTOTHEMOON was off a step slow, then chased the pace from the inside, was sent down leaving the five sixteenths and was between rivals, then
angled out by the furlong marker and was empty. ROYALBONNIELEGACY lacked a rally. DOUBLE DOINK was sent up the inside to set a pressured pace
on the inside and gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
TYLER TIME tracked the pace three wide down the backstretch, made a four wide bid midway on the far turn, then got even terms approaching the furlong
marker, then was trying to lug in through the furlong grounds, was given a left handed pop with the crop to stay off rival and edged clear to prove best.
GALILEE prompted the pace and made a three wide bid on the far turn to gain a short advantage by the quarter pole, then had a long drive with the winner
but was outfinished late, good effort. DOMINANT FACTOR stumbled badly at the start, then was reserved early, advanced on the inside on the turn, swung
out four wide for the drive and finished well. HONOR COLLECTION was settled early while four to five wide, came six wide into the drive and had no rally.
SECRET SOULMATE was off slowly, then passed the tiring rivals. BREWING STORM was settled back early three to four wide and failed to menace.
READTHETRANSCRIPT set the pace on the inside and gave way in the drive. T REX chased the pace four to five wide and stopped.

Footnotes
ROCKET BLAST chased the early pace on the inside, dropped back on the turn, swung out four wide for the drive, closed well to win going away late,
driving. TAKE IT TO SCALE pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole to duel for command, but flattened out leaving the
turn, then came again late to grab the place award. PETTINBERG set a pressured pace on the inside, then dueled for command by the quarter pole, shook
clear leaving the turn then had nothing left late, lost place award late, bested rest. AMERICANO was settled early and was four to five wide on the turn then
had a belated rally for the minor rewards. SMIRK chased the early pace, then was on the inside by the quarter pole and had no rally. GET A VALENTINE
stalked the early pace four wide, then was three wide by the quarter pole and weakened. LOVE THAT JAZZ was allowed to settle early and failed to
respond.
