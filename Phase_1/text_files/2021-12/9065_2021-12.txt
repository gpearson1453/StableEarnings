Footnotes
SHELLBY broke sharply and rated the pace, widened at the rail on the turn and was steadily handled to hold on well. PRACTICALLY DIZZY chased through
the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn then dueled through the lane for second. DEEMED ESSENTIAL chased the early pace outside, rounded the
turn about the three path then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. KIT KAT KATIE gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn and ran evenly through the
lane. STYLISH PAINT chased the early pace toward mid track, ran in the three path of the turn but showed little in the lane. SCARLET TANAGER chased
and rounded most of the turn off the rail, eased out into the lane but showed little further.

Footnotes
CHARLIE POTATOES settled close off the rail, bid leaving the three eighths pole and improved in the five path of the far turn, took the nod leaving the
eighth pole, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well. DAY OF HONOR came out to make light contact with Youreascoldasice leaving the gate then saved
ground racing well back from eary contention, eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and ran five wide on the far turn, then
dug in widest to take second later yards. TOMMY PIES was brushed at the break then settled off the pace in the three and four paths, bid leaving the three
eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn then outfinished for second later yards. CHILLING SECRET stalked from the three path the first turn, bid
nearing the three eighths pole and closed to the lead in the four path midway on the far turn, was caught past the eighth pole then flattened the final
sixteenth. MALIBU CIRCLE became anxious in the gate then saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, eased
outward into the stretch and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening. YOUREASCOLDASICE was bumped leaving the gate and settled inside the opening
turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little more. LUNAR IMAGE was brushed at the break
then shuffled back early, rounded the first turn about the three path and showed little response through the backstretch. ADIOS SEE YA tapered in through
the front stretch and rated a slim lead, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and dueled at even terms from that point, but weakened inside
the eighth pole. ZIP THE LIP stalked the early pace inside, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole and took a slim lead at the three eighths,
dueled at even terms nearest the rail to the mid point of the far turn then weakened.

DEVILISH BEAUTY saved ground off the early pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and improved at the rail on the far turn, eased just outside of
VINTAGE GIN leaving the turn, dug in for the lead later yards and inched clear nearing the wire. The latter took the lead at the three quarter pole and angled
to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure past the three eighths and put Anchor's Firstlady away on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch
handling but was caught in later yards. MY EXPENSIVE GIFT settled close in the three path, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and had range in the
four path of the far turn, angled to the inside mid-stretch, though, flattened the final sixteenth. CAIRO QUEEN rounded the opening turn in the four path and
left the turn outside, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four and five paths of the far turn then flattned the final furlong. CALLINGHERCOLLINS
rounded the first turn in the five path, started a bid toward the three eighths pole and saved ground on the far turn, though showed little further. ANCHOR'S
FIRSTLADY stalked off the rail then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced close two deep on the far turn, but weakened leaving the turn. ONE
SMART COOKIE was not a factor.

Footnotes
TALKTHETALK settled close inside then eased to the three path leaving the nine sixteenths pole, closed to the lead toward the five sixteenths, dueled clear
into the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. JUST A BIT SASSY rounded the opening turn in the four path and settled off the pace into the
backstretch, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the four path of the far turn, drifted into the stretch but dug in past the eighth
pole to take second later yards. ZIG settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and had range on the
leader in the three path of the far turn, though, flattened the final sixteenth. EARNED THE SHOT rounded the opening turn in the five path and raced outside
into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn and passed rivals outside. FRENCH NOUGET was hustled to the
lead nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to set the pace, dug in to LADY KAZA nearing the half mile pole but dropped back toward the
seven sixteenths and weakened into the far turn. The latter stalked the early pace two deep then took a slim lead nearing the half mile pole, was caught
toward the five sixteenth and weakened at the rail on the far turn. HARDSCRATCH was roughed off the heels of Talkthetalk into the first turn and saved
ground through the turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but showed little response. GLORIOUS MYSTERY rounded the first turn in the five path
and showed little response through the backstretch.

NAZCA MYSTERY stalked in the three path then bid toward the three eighths pole, took the lead approaching the quarter and contested the edge two deep
on the far turn, dueled clear in the upper stretch and was steadily encouraged to hold on well. SONDE ST BLUES rated a slim lead inside, came under
pressure at the three eighths pole and was met nearing the quarter, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn but dropped back past
the eighth pole and had to settle for second best. KITE SURFER settled back off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the
four path of the far turn and dueled for third inside the sixteenth pole. THORN OF ROSE HILL saved ground on the first turn, bid nearing the seven
sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, angled in mid-stretch then flattened late. TICKLING SPRINGS settled off the pace in the three path the
first turn, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, though, showed little in the lane. LUCKY PENGUIN settled off the rail on
the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail and showed little more. MASTER YOO raced well off
the pace about the three path the first turn and never factored. MINI BOLT saved ground. FANCY CASTLE rated close inside the first turn, gave chase

Footnotes
REVEIRS MINUTE chased the early pace outside, rounded the turn about the three path, was bumped by the runner-up in the vicinity of the eighth pole,
took over from that one mid-stretch and dueled clear later yards. STONES ROAD was hustled along to set a pressured pace, rounded the turn at the rail,
drifted outward to make contact with Reveirs Minute at the eighth pole, continued close through the upper stretch but relented later yards. REAL APPEAL
broke out to make contact with Another Excuse, was bumped from the inside a stride later and settled off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole,
rounded the turn about the five path, dug in from the outside leaving the turn and finished well to take third later yards. TRUENO FUERTE was hustled in
close early pursuit, dropped back at the rail past the five sixteenths pole and ran evenly in the lane. CASTLE'S TUFFY broke in to make contact with
Another Excuse and engaged in close early chase through the backstretch, then faded off the rail on the turn. NICKY D chased inside then flattened off the
rail on the turn. DAFFYDILL came out to make contact with Real Appeal on the chute and never factored. ANOTHER EXCUSE was jostled at the break,
gave chase through the backstretch then faded at the rail on the turn. LILBITSOFDRAMA saved ground. MISS ORA LEE became edgy in the gate and
never factored.
