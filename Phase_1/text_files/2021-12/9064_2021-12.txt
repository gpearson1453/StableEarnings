Footnotes
COOKIN ROSES sprinted to the lead soon after the start, held clear while saving ground through the turn, roused two wide into the lane, remained clear at
the eighth pole then held on late under a driving finish. KHOZYS CROWN broke on top then conceded position to COOKIN ROSES, chased winner two
wide through the turn, tipped out wider for the drive, finished willingly and just missed. PRINCESS CONSUELA raced in the back through early stages then
picked up the pace around the turn, launched an outside bid in the lane, steadily edged up closer and prevailed for a share. TOUCH BY FELICTY raced
near midpack and three wide through the turn, sustained a steady bid in the upper stretch then evened out in late stages. ELIZABETH'S GHOST was
reluctant to load, hustled along two to three wide through the turn, launched a rail bid in the stretch run, got in tight and steadied late. SOUTHERN ATTACK
raced in range to the upper stretch then gave way. SWEET SKY was ridden along two to three wide and lacked a needed rally.

MARCO'S DREAM vied outside of SEEK N JUSTICE through the turn, shook free in the upper stretch, pulled away to clear command and kept to task.
PACHI was forwardly placed three wide through early stages, continued to chase after the winner through the lane and cleared second best. WILLOW
RIDGE saved ground around the turn, sustained a rail bid through the lane and churned on for a share. OFFLEE FUN was unhurried through early stages,
roused four wide in the lane and had a mild improve. HELLOFAGUY lacked speed and saved ground, came three wide into the lane and failed to threaten.
ONCEWEWEREBROTHERS chased the top trio around the turn, sustained bid in the upper stretch then gave way. SEEK N JUSTICE dueled inside of
MARCO'S DREAM through the turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
PINBALLER cleared on top soon after the start, set a pressured pace through the backstretch, vied inside of KINGSBURRY ATTACK around the far turn,
shook free and held a slim lead in the upper stretch, battled on tenaciously with a eighth of a mile remaining, dueled in final strides with RAVE on, dug in
gamely from the inside and nipped foe on the wire. RAVE ON rated near midpack through early stages, moved up two wide through the turn, launched a
three wide bid in the upper stretch, advanced to challenge PINBALLER in late stages, dug in gamely and got nipped for the wire. HERO'S DAUGHTER
stalked the top two leaders through the backstretch, launched a rail bid at the head of the lane, raced in aim for the lead at the furlong marker then lacked
closing response. MORRIE'S JOY was unhurried through early stages, swung five wide into the lane and had a mild improve. KINGSBURRY ATTACK
prompted the pace through the backstretch, vied for the lead with eventual winner around the far turn then gave way. J J'S SOLUTION tracked the pace
through early stages, bid three wide around the far turn, came four wide into the lane and weakened. EL ROMANTICO settled off the pace, saved ground
and failed to move into contention. ROCKET HOTSHOT raced in the back, swung five wide into the lane and never threatened. HELLO HERO had no
response.

Footnotes
DOM CAETANO (ARG) was unhurried out of the gate and saved ground around the first turn, remained well reserved in the back through the backstretch,
angled out and picked up the pace late on the far turn, came five to six wide into the lane, rallied while angling in under right handed pressure and drew
clear. BRAVO BRAVO vied for the lead around the first turn, set a pressured pace through the backstretch, dueled inside of BLOOMING GARDEN around
the final turn, shook free at the head of the lane, fought back when challenged by the winner in the final furlong then had no closing response left in reserve.
LEE LA DEW rated off the early pace, moved up two wide through the far turn, coaxed three to four wide in the upper stretch, closed with response and
gained show. WHATA SHOW OFF tracked the top trio through the backstretch, moved up two wide through the far turn, sustained a bid in the upper stretch
then flattened out. BLOOMING GARDEN was forwardly placed through early stages, dueled for the lead with BRAVO BRAVO around the final turn and
gave way. RETAIN hesitated a got away a bit slowly at the start, raced off the pace, came four to five wide into the lane and failed to move on. COPPER
CROSSING vied for the lead around the first turn, stalked through the backstretch, remained in contention on the rail through the far turn then faded.
POWERFUL MAN raced near midpack going by the half mile marker, moved up closer three to four wide around the far turn then retreated.

ALMAFUERTE was forwardly placed tracking the early leader, launched a three wide bid into the lane, edged away on top past the eighth pole, dug in under
right handed pressure and held on in final stride. SHE'S A BIG STAR tracked the top two leaders through the turn, hustled up four wide into stretch run,
continued to gain on the winner in final strides and just missed. RONAN lacked early speed and raced in the rear, then picked up the pace leaving the turn,
came four wide into the lane, took closer order, angled inside in late stages, stayed on with response and cleared the rest. COUGER was not far back early
on, coaxed four wide through the turn, stayed outside into the lane and lacked the late needed response for impact. BOBBIE TOO TOO cleared and crossed
to the inside soon after the start, held firm on top through the turn, stayed on in the upper stretch then came up empty in the final furlong. SIMPLY FAST
chased in contention along the inside through the turn then weakened in the lane. SONG AND A KISS shifted out to race five wide through early stages,
came in a couple paths around the far turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
PURR SEA was away quickly and battled inside of OEUVRE for the early lead, edged back briefly late on the backstretch and tipped out a path, then moved
back up to engage rival for the lead, and remained well clear over the next pursuer through the turn, battled on gamely into the lane, remained heads apart
then edged ahead in deep stretch. OEUVRE broke out at the start then angled in to race two wide in opening stages, briefly held the edge then came back
under attack and dueled inside of PURR SEA through the turn, battled on while well clear over the next pursuer at the head of the lane, fought back from the
inside into late stages then had no closing kick left in reserve. GHAALEB'S RANGER raced off the clear top pair through early stages, then headed in
pursuit around the turn, stayed on three to four wide in the upper stretch, drifted out wider under pressure and closed the gap on the top pair. SASSY LIKE
JULIA was off a step slow at the start and raced near the back, roused four wide into the lane, steadily drifted out wider through the lane and needed more
for late impact. SWEET FRAULEIN lacked speed, urged outside into the stretch then angled in and had no response. I DON'T KNOW MARGO was off a
step slow at the start, chased the early pace, came up empty midway through the turn and jogged in.
