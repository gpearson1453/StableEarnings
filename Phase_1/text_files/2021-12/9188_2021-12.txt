Footnotes
ALLEN tracked the leaders three deep in second flight racing through the backstretch, advanced in that path racing through the turn to challenge for
command nearing upper stretch, gained the advantage in late stages and just held ROARING RIVER under brisk handling. The latter broke in the air while
getting away last, settled into stride dropping off the second flight racing to the turn, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to
advance, moved to challenge the winner in the final sixteenth but was outkicked. SAVVY LAYLA, in touch attending the pace outside a rival in the opening
quarter, pressed the issue on the turn into upper stretch to gain the advantage in the lane but yielded to the top pair late. THROWN FOR A LOUPE, pulling
along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing through the backstretch, dueled for command racing through the turn and weakened once
he was headed in upper stretch. OUTSTANDING DEBT tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. CASTLE
KING tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
WORKING OVERTIME was rated in the opening stages while angling to the inside racing to the gap, switched out four wide racing past the half mile marker
while making steady progress to close the gap on the pacesetter, moved to terms with that foe nearing upper stretch, then continued with a steady late
response to wrest the advantage in time under firm right handed encouragement while being carried out slightly in the closing stages. ROYAL ATHENA
broke sharply, shifted off the rail racing past the gap while being urged to dictate the pace on a clear margin racing to the turn, continued to set the pace on
a narrow advantage shifting to the three path racing into upper stretch, drifted out while being roused to resist the winner's bid in the closing stages but
couldn't fend off that rival. ME SAY SO tracked the pacesetter inside foes as part of the second flight racing into the bend, shifted off the inside nearing
upper stretch and faded in the drive while just edging a rival for a share. CATIRUSIA was settled last while angling to the rail, saved ground to upper stretch
and passed inside tiring rivals while just missing for a share. TAMIAMI tracked the pacesetter between foes as part of the second flight racing to the turn and
faded into upper stretch. MANGROVE MAMMA ,urged to a forward placing three deep tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, gave way racing
into the stretch.

Footnotes
IRISH DREAM GIRL, in touch with the leaders five deep racing past the chute, was rated off the first flight four wide racing through the backstretch, was
prompted to advance in the four path entering the turn, continued in pursuit of the leader to upper stretch and responded to firm right handed pressure to
wrest the advantage in time. CALIDAD joined the pace three wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue in that path racing into the turn, edged forward
remaining well off the rail racing into upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid but couldn't contain that foe late. AMERICAN EMPRESS ducked at the start,
was collected, then urged inside foes to press the pace racing through the backstretch into the turn, shifted off the inside nearing upper stretch while losing
terms with the leaders and gave way in upper stretch while continuing well enough to prevail for a share. JULIE'S GRACE vied for the lead inside a rival
racing well off the rail, then between foes racing through the backstretch into the turn, ducked out racing into upper stretch and soon gave way. J D'S VISTA
tracked off the first flight inside rivals racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. EXAGGERATED MOMENT tracked off the first flight three wide
between foes racing into the bend but offered no rally. ADRIANA ES BONITA settled between foes in second flight and dropped out nearing the lane.

Footnotes
LILY'S LEAD was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, switched off the inside nearing upper stretch while being prompted to
advance, swung out five wide splitting foes racing into upper stretch, drifted out while being roused to advance in the final sixteenth but surged to the lead in
time under strong handling to narrowly prevail. CAPETOWN CANDY, caught four wide between foes leaving the chute while being prompted to contention,
tracked off the leaders three wide in second flight through the backstretch, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance, bid
for command between foes in that path nearing the wire but was just outkicked. GOLDEN ROCKET, forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the
pacesetter in the opening half, was urged to advance in that path nearing upper stretch challenging for command, gained the advantage midstretch but
couldn't quite match the top pair late. LIBERTALIA angled inwards racing to the first turn gaining a position just off the pacesetter tracking that rival, was
urged to press the issue between foes on the far turn into upper stretch but weakened late. LLUVIA sped to the lead while angling inside racing to the first
turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage for a half, dueled for command inside foes through the far turn into upper stretch but faded late. BLUE
NEITH, pulling against restraint while angling inwards racing to the first turn, was reserved inside foes to the second bend, tipped out three wide racing into
the stretch but had no rally. DURA THE EXPLORER stalked just off the pacesetter inside foes racing to the far turn but faded into upper stretch.
BELLAVALENCIA ducked out at the start, then was caught wide racing to the first turn, settled outside rivals racing to the backstretch and had no closing
response. CANDIA, restless in the gate prior to the start, broke slowly and never gained contention.

Footnotes
BRIDGEKEEPER tracked the leaders from just out of striking distance along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn advancing on
the leader, tipped out in upper stretch while being roused to challenge and wore down WESTWARD LOOK in time under firm right handed encouragement.
The latter was urged to terms with the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, prompted that rival racing into the far turn to gain a clear advantage, held sway
along the rail into upper stretch, resisted the winner's challenge but proved only second best. ROSE FOR A SAINT tracked off the second flight racing to the
backstretch, shifted out to race three wide between foes entering the far turn, briefly awaited an opening, then split foes just off the inside racing through the
stretch to gain a share nearing the wire. NOT INVENTED HERE, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, came around a tiring foe to advance
inside foes racing into the stretch but was outkicked for a share. BIG POLO, off slowly, was rated along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out gaining
position on the far turn, angled four wide in upper stretch but had no late kick. ROLL ON DUDE, forwardly placed three deep leaving the chute, tracked off
the first flight outside the eventual winner racing to the second bend and faded into the lane. MASPERO, reserved last in the opening half, never gained
contention. JAMA DILLON tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening half, made some brief progress four wide racing into the far turn but soon
flattened out. HUSBAND IN LAW settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. WHISKEY PLANK, urged along the inside dictating the
pace on a narrow advantage, dueled for command inside a rival racing into the second bend but soon gave way.

Footnotes
CANDY CRUSHEM was prompted to a position inside foes racing just behind the leaders through the backstretch, awaited an opening when losing his path
entering the turn, shifted out to split rivals just off the inside racing through upper stretch, bid for command racing past the furlong marker and edged forward
under firm right handed encouragement. IMPERIAL BREW was rated off the second flight inside a rival in the opening three furlongs, angled out five wide
midway through the turn while advancing on the leaders, bid for command in that path between foes nearing upper stretch, exchanged some contact with
MITZRAYIM disputing the lead nearing midstretch, shifted inwards under pressure and was outkicked by the winner. ZONIC settled well off the field racing
to the turn, switched out gathering momentum racing into upper stretch, altered course entering the lane to split foes three wide midstretch and found his
best stride late to gain a share. MITZRAYIM, reluctant to load in the gate, gained a forward placing racing just off the leaders in the three path racing
through the backstretch, was urged to advance between foes in in that path on the turn challenging for command nearing upper stretch, shifted out
exchanging some contact with IMPERIAL BREW in the lane and flattened out late. MESA SKYLINE, reserved well off the leaders in the opening half,
switched outside foes on the turn, was fanned seven wide in upper stretch and made some belated progress. RESIDENT tracked off the second flight
outside a rival on the backstretch, was prompted to advance entering the turn, was caught six wide nearing upper stretch and had no closing bid. HOT AND
HEAVY, urged disputing the pace inside a rival racing a bit off the rail racing through the backstretch, gave way after a half. FREE FLAYME tracked just off
the first flight four wide racing to the turn, was urged to lodge a brief bid in that path between foes nearing upper stretch but quickly gave out. UNSPOILED
MOMENTS, held up last racing through the backstretch, failed to menace. IDLE TIME, urged prompting the pace outside a rival racing to the turn, dueled
inside foes on the bend and gave way abruptly racing into upper stretch .

Footnotes
JO JO KATZ, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, gained some position inside foes entering the far turn, switched off the inside nearing
upper stretch, angled to the four path entering the lane and responded to firm encouragement to wrest a narrow advantage in time. VAN broke readily,
tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped out to the three path racing through upper stretch, then bid for command in
tandem with the winner in the closing stages while just failing to match that foe. OUR STUIE, forwardly placed just outside the pacesetter racing to the first
turn, continued between foes on the backstretch, advanced to press the issue on the far turn into the stretch and continued willingly resisting the top pair
while edging a rival for a share. COCHISE CHARLIE broke inwards bumping HELLFIRE BOB, sprinted to the lead while angling sharply to the rail leaving
the chute, met a rival's challenge midway through the backstretch to set the pace on a narrow margin into the second bend, dueled for command inside foes
into the lane and continued grudgingly to the end. SILENT SONATA was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped out
racing through the stretch to gain some position but was outkicked while racing in some close quarters late. HELLFIRE BOB, held up after being bumped at
the start, raced in the last flight between foes to the backstretch and offered no rally. IN HONOR OF ARTIE was prompted to a position just off the leaders
racing three deep leaving the chute, was carried out a bit by PRICING EXERCISE racing through the first turn to race four deep on the backstretch, was
prompted to make some brief progress in that path racing into the second bend but soon emptied out. FEISTY KITTEN settled outside foes in the last flight
racing to the backstretch and proved no threat. PRICING EXERCISE, pulling hard against restraint while rank between foes, was steadied nearing the
backstretch, switched out to make a early move challenging the pacesetter three deep after a half but emptied out early.

Footnotes
KATHERN'S JOY broke readily, stalked just outside the pacesetter racing to the second bend, was urged to challenge from between racing through the far
turn, then wrested the advantage leaving midstretch and held KHOZANDO under firm encouragement. The latter tracked the leaders between foes in
second flight to the backstretch, shifted three wide racing into the second bend advancing on the leaders, bid for command leaving midstretch but proved
only second best. SUPER EDGAR broke sharply, dictated the pace along the inside to the far turn, dueled inside the top pair past midstretch but weakened
late. MR. EINSTEIN tracked off the second flight outside rivals in the opening half, angled in on the far turn and continued evenly. SKYDIVING settled
between foes dropping well off the leaders, then split foes racing three deep into the lane to improve position. STRIKING IT LUCKY tracked off the first flight
racing three wide into the backstretch and faded after a half. SUNNY SAINT, reserved near the inside racing to the backstretch, failed to menace. ALPERES
tracked off the second flight between foes and offered no rally. PHARAOH FANCY PANT tracked the leaders inside foes as part of the second flight but
gave way after a half. PASCAL trailed throughout.

HARRY angled to the rail tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch while being prompted to
advance and proved best of the others. LE COSTE was rated tracking the leaders inside foes in second flight to the backstretch, saved ground to upper
stretch and finished evenly late while earning a share. HARROW, a bit reluctant to load, hopped at the start, was settled well off the leaders outside a rival
racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to gain some position. ALEXANDER VALLEY was rated
between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch but came up empty in the drive. BATTLE OF BRITAIN broke readily, then pulled against restraint
once headed by the eventual winner leaving the chute, switched outside that foe racing to the backstretch stalking the pace, was prompted to lodge a brief
bid racing through the far turn but quickly flattened out entering the lane. COASTAL WATERS settled last to the far turn and passed only tiring rivals.
DEREGULATION (GB) tracked the leaders three wide in second flight to the backstretch and gave way racing into the far turn. FLORIDA PHARAOH,
reserved along the inside, retreated early.
