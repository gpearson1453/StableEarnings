SARIAH SARIAH broke a step slow, rushed up, challenged for the lead, dueled to the wire and prevailed for the win. HEART THAT BINDS unhurried in the
early part, made a late outside bid and finished willingly. KIDDO TOWN dueled on the front end, forwardly placed throughout, saved ground and was
outfinished. SOPHIE'S PRAYER pressed the early pace, steadied around the second turn, got in tight quarters, weakened and finished evenly. RACY
JAYCEE void of early speed, saved ground around the final turn and was never a factor. GREAT IN RED raced near the back and showed little.

KIND WAYS went to the front, drove clear, led throughout, was all out and held on well for the win. US SECOND CUTE PIE pressed the pace, saved
ground around the second turn, made a late bid and was gaining on the winner. FASTED void of early speed, saved ground around the final turn, made a
late bid, but proved no match for the top two. STORMY SUNRISE raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the final turn and was outfinished for
third. EM'S MISS PRADO lacked early speed, came around the second turn wide and was never a factor. TABLE ONE pressed the pace and faded.
DEVASTATING BEAUTY broke a step slow, raced in the back, had an outside trip and was no threat.

SPIRIT SOUL unhurried in the beginning, made a late rally, racing four wide, drove clear and finished strong. ZONGLAND pressed the pace, came around
the second turn three wide, took the lead entering the stretch, but couldn't hold off the winner. UNSPOKEN MEMORIES vied for the early advantage,
forwardly placed throughout, but proved no match for the top two at the wire. OSCAR CHOICE raced within striking distance, made a mild bid and was
outfinished for show. MULETRAIN raced in the back of the pack, came around the final turn on the outside, improved position, racing wide, but was no
factor. ACTIFDASH raced near the middle of the field, saved ground around the second turn and weakened. PORQUE SI raced within striking distance,
came around the first turn wide and faded. REACHFORTHESABER dueled on the front end, saved ground around the final turn and dropped back.

GOODNIGHT GRACIE pressed the pace, moved up, racing outside around the turn, rallied down the lane and proved the best late. EZEE ENOUGH dueled
on the front end, forwardly placed throughout, was outfinished by the winner, but proved best of others. MISS UNDERRATED void of early speed, came
around the turn wide, made an outside bid and got up for third. ROSE CROWN vied for the early lead, saved ground around the turn and weakened down
the home stretch. DIAL EM IN raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. SUCKERFORAGREY raced near the middle of the pack, saved ground
around the turn and faded. WHOLESHACKSHIMMIES always raced near the back, lost contact with the field and was eased to the wire.

Footnotes
TESUQUE unhurried in the early part, moved up around the final turn, made a bid, racing four wide and was going away at the end. FRIENDLY AND KIND
pressed the pace, took the lead around the second turn, proved no match for the winner late, but was a clear second. FABULOUS GIRL was reluctant to
load, went to the front at the start, drove clear and weakened down the home stretch. GOODNIGHTSUGAR raced near the back in the early part, made a
mild bid, but was no factor. HARLANS WARRIOR raced near the middle of the field, came around the first turn on the outside, finished wide and put forth an
even effort. HURRICANE TIZWAY pressed the early pace, saved ground around the second turn and faded. TIZ ONE FEE always raced near the back and
showed little.
