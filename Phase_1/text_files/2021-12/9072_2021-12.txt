SURREAL FANTASY was urged clear along the inside racing to the backstretch, widened the advantage under some prompting racing through the far turn,
then drew well clear in the closing stages while being kept to firm left handed encouragement. AULENTI tracked off rivals in the second flight racing four
deep to the backstretch, and continued with a steady effort in that path racing into the stretch to prove best of the others. WONDERSTRUCK, forwardly
placed tracking just off the pacesetter shifting to the three path on the backstretch, lost contact with the winner on the far turn and steadily faded into the
lane. LIKING IT TWISTED switched a bit off the inside racing to the first turn tracking the pacesetter inside a rival, then between foes on the backstretch but
emptied out racing into the far turn. REDZILLA broke outwards brushing a rival, angled to the rail racing to the first turn tracking the pacesetter as part of the
second flight but faded after a half. BEAUTIFUL ROSALIA ducked out just after the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LAP OF LUXURY was urged along the rail in the opening stages to gain terms with the first flight, tracked just off those foes entering the bend, shifted out
three wide on the turn while advancing to challenge, took over racing into upper stretch and went clear under brisk right handed pressure. DOLCISIMA
broke outwards bumping BELLE GOSSE, was collected, then angled to the inside tracking the leaders from out of striking distance, shifted out four wide
nearing upper stretch gathering momentum and continued with a steady late effort to prevail for the place honors. TITANIC ROSE settled outside foes in the
last flight racing to the turn, shifted inwards nearing upper stretch and improved position three deep between foes in the closing stages to gain a share.
SECRETIVE MISS broke sharply, prompted the pace four wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards pressing the issue outside a rival racing into the turn
and faded late when failing to contain the winner. BELLE GOSSE exchanged bumps with DOLCISIMA at the start, was settled between foes in early stages,
shifted out splitting foes to lodge a brief bid nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. STERLINA was hustled between foes to gain the lead along the
inside, dueled for command racing into the turn and gave way entering upper stretch. ESTILO DIFERENTE, fractious while loading in the gate, never
seriosuly menaced. RUSTON DRILL made brief pursuit of the leaders three wide between foes but emptied out early.

Footnotes
MORGAN POINT was settled outside foes in the opening stages, was prompted to gain contention nearing the turn, gathered momentum while swinging out
five wide racing into upper stretch, quickly wrested the advantage while drifting inwards under pressure racing to midstretch, came under left handed
pressure but continued to drift inside, then was taken in hand in the closing stages while drawing clear. GREY CHARMER tracked just off the pacesetter
between foes racing to the turn, came through close quarters to bid inside the pacesetter racing into upper stretch, couldn't match terms with the winner but
proved best of the others. EL BAILADOR was rated three deep in second flight tracking the pacesetter, shifted out four wide to bid between foes racing into
upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. IT'S NOT EASY tracked off the second flight outside foes, was prompted to make a brief, four wide advance
on the turn but flattened out entering the stretch. DORSODURO, reserved near the inside racing through the backstretch, switched out entering the lane and
passed some tiring rivals late. IMPERIAL BIRD sprinted clear along the inside racing through the backstretch, held sway on a narrow advantage to upper
stretch and gave out leaving the furlong marker. WOOTDAREITIS, forwardly placed along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter, gave way into the lane.
GOLDEN WONDER trailed throughout.

Footnotes
NOVELERA was rated along the rail dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling shifting off the inside leaving
the midway point of the turn, angled five wide midstretch and produced a solid late response to wrest the advantage in time under firm handling. ANAHIYA'S
DREAM was urged inside rivals disputing the pace on a narrow advantage into the backstretch, dueled for command inside foes on the far turn, edged
forward in upper stretch but just failed to contain the winner. TIZ NENA was rated off the second flight while angling inwards racing to the backstretch,
gained three deep between foes while briefly awaiting an opening nearing upper stretch, split foes three wide racing through the stretch to close the gap but
was outkicked by the top pair. MISS LADY L tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch, was prompted to advance racing four wide through
the far turn to upper stretch and continued willingly in that path late. MISSPOKEN worked her way to the inside to track just off the pacesetter racing to the
backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch while being urged to advance inside rivals but faded in the drive. MIA ROSA tracked off the first flight outside a
rival in the opening half, advanced to lodge a brief bid three wide between foes on the far turn but came up empty leaving midstretch. SUMMER HELPER
settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. A TOUCH OF SPADGET settled last to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch
but made no impression. READY TO RUMBLE, urged prompting a rival's pace in the opening six furlongs, gave way into upper stretch. RACHEL DREAM
dropped out early.

Footnotes
PLATINUM GEM broke readily to gain terms with a rival attending the pace under light rating racing into the bend, pressed the issue leaving the turn to gain
a narrow advanatage and responded to firm encouragement leaving midstretch to open a commanding advantage in late stages. SUMMER OF MISCHIEF
bobbled, then was bumped at the start, was righted, then urged to contend switching out three deep advancing on the leaders racing into the bend, shifted
inside the leaders racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. STANDUP COMEDIENNE broke outwards bumping
SUMMER OF MISCHIEF, was urged along the inside disputing the pace inside the eventual winner while shifting off the rail nearing the lane but proved no
match late. LATIN NIKKITA settled last while angling inside racing to the turn, swung out five wide entering the lane and continued to improve position.
MACLEAN'S BELLA tracked just off the first flight inside rivals racing into the turn but lacked a closing bid. GET SERIOUS, forwardly placed between foes in
the opening stages, tracked just off the leaders outside a rival racing into the turn and faded into upper stretch. LADY G broke sharply, tracked off the
second flight racing in the four path on the backstretch, was urged to advance in that path racing into the turn but had no rally. STRAWBERRY POINT
settled between foes in early stages, angled inwards racing into the turn but offered no rally. CHROME SAVAGE proved no factor. LINGUISTIC exchanged
brushes while caught in close quarters early, was caught widest on the backstretch and dropped out early. PUERTORICAN DIVA soon dropped out.

flight, steadied momentarily shifting a bit off the inside racing into the first turn, continued to track off the second flight along the inside saving ground into the
far turn, tipped out racing through upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to gain the place honors. BOSSHOG THEM DUKES angled to the rail
gaining a position just off the leaders in early stages, steadied avoiding GREAT JUNIOR entering the first turn, was righted to track just off the leaders
saving ground into the far turn, tipped out three wide racing through the stretch but couldn't macth terms with the top pair. OCTOBER TIME angled in
sharply racing to the first turn while being urged to force the pace outside a rival, angled to the rail once gaining the advantage, set the pace on a narrow
margin to upper stretch and gave way once headed by the winner. STEALTH MISSION raced outside foes, then was steadied while being forced wide
avoiding GREAT JUNIOR racing into the first turn, tracked off the second flight outside foes to the second bend, was fanned four wide while being prompted

Footnotes
STRATEGIC BIRD broke sharply, sprinted to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage into the turn, met the challenge of DEVINE
CHARGER dueling with that one into upper stretch and grudgingly maintained the advantage under firm handling. DEVINE CHARGER exchanged bumps
with JACKKNIFE at the start, was righted to pursue the pacesetter between foes in the opening quarter, gained terms with that rival on the bend to press the
issue into upper stretch and continued willingly to dispute the issue to the end. CHASING HAPPINESS, squeezed at the break, then steadied, tracked off
the second flight to the turn, split foes midway through the bend and continued with a steady effort to gain a share while never menacing the top pair. SHE'S
SO BEAUTIFUL broke readily, was guided to the rail in early stages tracking inside foes in second flight, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing
bid. DEVILETTE, forwardly placed four wide in the opening quarter, faded between foes into the stretch. TAHAWEEL ducked out at the start, then trailed the
field to the stretch while proving no threat. SHE'S MY WARRIOR broke inwards bumping SHE'S PEACHY KEEN, flashed brief pace three wide between
foes, angled inwards early tracking off the first flight and faded into the lane. JACKKNIFE exchanged bumps at the start, was settled inside foes and proved
no threat. SHE'S PEACHY KEEN, bumped, then squeezed back avoiding tight quarters at the start, was urged to advance making brief progress five wide
racing into the bend but gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
AMAZON QUEEN angled inwards in the opening stages while being rated off the second flight, switched out of tight quarters nearing the backstretch,
gained position between foes racing into the far turn, tipped out three wide to challenge the leaders midstretch and prevailed in time under firm handling.
WINGSPUN angled inwards early to track just off the pacesetter outside a rival to the backstretch, moved to challenge the leader leaving the far turn, gained
the advantage midstretch, then resisted the winner's bid but came up second best. LUNA ANTONIA was rated off the second flight along the inside to the
backstretch, angled out three wide racing into the lane, then shifted inwards splitting rivals late to prevail for a share. CORNICE TRAVERSE angled inwards
to track off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, was fanned five wide racing into upper stretch but continued with interest to improve
position to the end. DAWN, off slowly, settled well off the leaders to the far turn, swung outside rivals racing into upper stretch and made some belated
progress between foes. BABY LUCK sped to the lead along the inside racing to the backstretch, dictated the pace to the far turn, dueled inside a rival to
midstretch and gave way leaving the furlong marker. A WORD FROM ARTIE, held up avoiding close quarters in early stages, failed to menace. BAD AND
BEAUTIFUL hopped at the start, settled along the inside early and proved no threat. LADY WOOD, forwardly placed along the inside tracking just off the
pacesetter, steadied a bit in tight quarters nearing the backstretch and faded after a half. BABY NO WORRIES switched out four wide racing into the first
turn while being prompted in brief pursuit of the leaders but was spent early.

Footnotes
CATTIN was urged to contend three wide between foes racing just off the first flight to the turn, advanced in that path nearing upper stretch to wrest the
advantage and went clear under right handed encouragement. LIGHTENING LARRY, forwardly placed four wide between foes between foes racing through
the backstretch, continued with a steady effort in that path through the turn to the stretch and proved best of the others. GRAND VALLEY was rated off the
first flight while angling inwards racing to the turn, then shifted out to improve position between foes late. MAGICAL MOUSSE, urged inside rivals disputing
the pace from the outset into the turn, dueled for command into the lane and gave way once headed by the winner. OLD TOWN ROAD settled last racing to
the turn, split foes racing into upper stretch and made some belated progress. VIVA VICTORY, urged along the rail pursuing the leaders to the turn, faded
into upper stretch. FULL DISCLOSURE was urged to force the pace outside a rival through the backstretch to the turn and gave way after a half.
CONCRETE GLORY made brief pursuit of the leaders five wide racing to the turn while coming under pressure early and soon faded.
WHISTLEWHILEYOUMOW dropped out early.

Footnotes
GRUMLEY broke sharply, set the pace along the rail to the backstretch, dispatched a rival's challenge racing into upper stretch and forged clear under firm
encouragement. WATCH THE MUSIC, pulling a bit in the opening stages tracking just outside the pacesetter, conceded some position under patient
handling after a half to stalk that rival along the inside, switched out racing into upper stretch and prevailed for the place honors while failing to regain terms
with the winner. RAISING MOON, off last, was reserved outside a rival to the far turn, split foes racing into upper stretch, then angled four wide in the
closing stages while just failing to gain the place honors. LUDO tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the far turn, tipped out three wide racing
through the stretch and finished evenly late. CALL ME CASSIUS settled along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to the lane, then shifted
out in late stages to gain some position between foes. DELTA RIDGE, caught four wide racing into the first turn while gaining a position in second flight,
made an early move to gain terms with the pacesetter after a half prompting that foe into the second bend but emptied out in the drive. BATTLING BAILIFF
settled along the inside early and failed to menace. DEVIL'S MYTH tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight to the backstretch and faded after a
half. SERIFOS was settled outside foes in early stages and proved no threat. ANGEL'S MAGIC pulled against restraint ducking out tracking off the first flight
between foes racing to the first turn, continued racing rankly between foes into the backstretch, lost ground to the leaders nearing the far turn, switched
outside foes racing into the stretch and emptied out.
