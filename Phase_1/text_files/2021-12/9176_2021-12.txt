Footnotes
CUTEFACECHUBYWAIST pressed the early pace from between rivals, then was shuffled back on the turn, shifted out to make a four to five wide bid
leaving the quarter pole, closed well to edge clear in the final sixty yards, driving. LITTLEBITALILY dueled for the early lead from the two to three path, then
made a bid to take command on the turn in the two path, then shook clear leaving the turn, was headed by the sixteenth marker and could not go with his
stable mate late, second best. RUSSIAN MELODY was off a step slow, then made a three wide bid on the turn to press the pace but flattened out, bested
rest. CALYPSO GHOST dueled for the early lead on the inside, checked entering the far turn and weakened. POLISHED GAL was bumped at the start,
chased the pace two wide on the turn and offered no kick in the drive. PARANOIA chased the pace on the inside and lacked a rally. SPIRIT OR SPITE
chased the pace four wide on the turn and came five wide into the drive and was empty.

COURTING JENNY prompted the pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn, shook clear in the furlong grounds, then lasted late to prove best
under a drive. SACRED LADY was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the drive while advancing, closed well to just miss. MY WAY OR ELSE was
reserved early, advanced five wide on the turn and by the quarter pole, rallied well late on the outside to gain the show award. STORMY SPELL pressed the
early pace and made a three wide bid to set the pace on the turn but faded the final furlong, lost show award late. SHE'S ACHANCE TOO was settled back
early, then was four wide by the quarter pole while advancing, shifted to the outside in the drive and had a belated rally for the minor rewards. BANK
ROLLIN broke outwardly at the start, then made a three wide middle move to be in contention on the turn but flattened out. FAIRY DUST lacked a rally.
LAVELLO set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened. SMOKIN CLASS forced the pace between rivals early and checked by the quarter pole,
weakened. RUN THE BLUES AWAY chased the early pace on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
KERICS BEAUTY was rated and made a four wide bid leaving the quarter pole, kicked clear the final sixteenth to prove best under left handed crop urging.
SPUNKY ZOEY was bumped at the start, pressed the pace three wide, made a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole to shake clear by the furlong marker,
but was caught at the sixteenth pole and could not match strides with the winner late, clearly second best. MEXICALI ROSE set a pressured pace on the
inside and dueled for command by the quarter pole then weakened in the drive, lasted for the show award. RUN LAURA RUN pressed the early pace from
between rivals, then swung out four wide leaving the turn and was empty. MIDNIGHT FLING was bumped at the start, then settled and was two wide by the
quarter pole, swung out five wide for the drive and had no rally. LOVELY EVER AFTER was reserved early on the inside and lacked a rally. THIEF OF
DREAMS had no response while five wide early.

Footnotes
NINE TOE JOHNNY was off a step slow, then was rated to the outside and in the clear on the backstretch, made a four to five wide bid leaving the quarter
pole and drew clear by the furlong marker, then was kept to pressure to maintain the advantage. ALL TACKED UP was well placed early on the inside, then
was boxed by the quarter pole on the inside, then split rivals leaving the three sixteenths, and finished willingly but could not gain on the winner late, while
second best. PIGGYBANK was four wide into the first turn, then stalked the pace three wide, made a bid to gain a short advantage on the turn, then faded in
the drive. PRATT stalked the pace two wide and weakened. TUCKERTON BAY was reluctant to load, set the pace in the two path while clear, then was
headed entering the far turn, and weakened. SIMMONS was reserved early on the inside and lacked a rally. GALLINIPPER was settled early in between
rivals and weakened. LONG TOM was reserved early while three wide and had no response.
