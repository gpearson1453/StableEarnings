Footnotes
TEMBO off slow and tossed his head at the start, chased three then four wide on the first turn, traveled four deep up the backstretch, got brushed into the
stretch while four wide, bid outside with three-sixteenths remaining and wore down the runner-up in the final sixteenth. SLY sped clear around the first turn
and went three then two wide around the bend, gained pressure at the half-mile pole, maintained the lead through the far turn, cleared briefly in upper
stretch before being challenged with three-sixteenths remaining, held a short advantage into the furlong grounds, resisted in the final sixteenth before being
overtaken in the final strides. SALAH raced two then three wide around the first turn, stayed close up off the inside, drifted out and brushed rival into the
stretch, could not match strides with top pair in the late stages but stayed on to hold third. SQUALOTORO stalked the pace from inside, launched a bid from
inside with a quarter of a mile remaining but faltered in the final furlong. LIGHTNING FAST rated between rivals then in the two path, continued two wide
into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
MAD GRACE stalked off the rail, driven three wide into the stretch, drew alongside at the eighth pole and proved best late. DESTINY'S JOURNEY sped to
the front to establish the lead, set all the pace to the stretch, met the bid from NORTHER GEM at the quarter pole, turned that rival away, tested by MAD
GRACE with a furlong to go and yielded grudingly. NORTHERN GEM stalked the pace from inside, put in a rail bid at the quarter pole, could not kick on with
the leader in midstretch and churned on to hold the show. AWESOME DRIVE traveled two wide early, raced in mid-pack up the backstretch, came four wide
into the lane and lacked the necessary bid. TAKE A LEAP raced along the inside then two wide around the first turn, settled off the pace, angled out and
came five wide into the stretch and failed to menace. ROSE PRINCESS went four wide around the clubhouse turn, remained in that path to the second
bend near the back, angled to the rail around the turn and was not a factor. GOTTA BE LUCKY went four wide around the first turn, tracked outside a rival in
the middle stages, continued four wide into the far turn, dropped back around the bend and came five wide into the stretch and had little left for the stretch
run.

BIG STRETCH dropped back early, raced a bit off the rail into the stretch, steered to the outside in the drive and surged late to overhaul the runnner-up.
SCREAM AND SHOUT was forwardly placed from the inside early, angled out on the turn and exited the bend three to four wide, rallied to the front with a
furlong to go, cleared briefly approaching the sixteenth pole but got run down late. HAPPY TRAILS stalked off the rail, came four wide into the stretch and
got up for the show. SUITE MADAM BLUE chased from outside briefly then went up to duel for command, lost a bit of ground into the stretch, came back
and took over past the three-sixteenths pole, lost command at the eighth pole and weakened late. READY JET GO away quickly to grab the lead, dueled
into and around the turn, cleared briefly into the stretch, was overtaken in midstretch and weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
PAUL VINCENTS POEM was off alertly from inside, set the pace under pressure to the turn, cleared past the seven-sixteenths pole, continued clear into the
final furlong and drew away. MAD CATTER chased three wide into the turn, angled out into the stretch, could not summon the needed rally in the final
furlong but bested the rest. HEREDIA BOXER was off a bit slow and got crowded leaving the gate, traveled along the inside then two wide into the stretch
and never rallied. SAFE COMBINATION broke a bit slow from outside, raced widest up the backstretch, came six wide into the lane and lacked a rally. TOP
ROYAL stumbled at the start, was forwardly placed in the early stages, traveled three then four wide around the turn and weakened. ROCKETCENT chased
off the rail, lost ground through the turn, eased out to the four path leaving the bend, moved out in the stretch and finished between foes late. DECEMBER
SKYE dropped back early, raced along the inside then steered out and entered the stretch three to four wide and came up empty.

KING APOLLO pressed the pace from inside, dueled in the stretch and bested HAPPY RUNNER in the final furlong. HAPPY RUNNER set the pace under
pressure from inside, dueled with KING APOLLO down the stretch and was outkicked in the final furlong while clearly second best. CURLY ESA stalked the
top pair near the inside, came three wide into the stretch and finished a clear third. MIDNIGHT MAJESTY sat off the pace, went two wide into the drive and
failed to threaten. LA'OCH ALOYSIUS chased off the rail, exited the turn four wide and lacked a rally. POLLO D'ORO was off slow to begin, stalked outside
a rival, moved out and came five wide into the stretch and weakened. CHASING ALCHEMY chased off the rail from off the pace, angled in on the turn,
steered back out in the lane and failed to menace. MONGOLIAN BONUS was off slow to begin, trailed three wide into the lane and was not a factor.

Footnotes
PROFESSORS' PRIDE sped to the front, got pressed briefly at the nine-sixteenths pole, cleared past the five-eighths, inched away on the second bend,
drew away under right-handed urging and remained clear to the wire. BIG NOVEL went four wide into the first turn, got floated out five wide and shuffled on
the first turn, tracked three wide to the second bend, moved out and came five wide into the stretch, produced a mild rally and earned the place honors.
MADIHA chased along the inside, went up to press the pace briefly at the nine-sixteenths pole but could not stay with the leader, chased three wide into the
lane and churned on to hold the show. GIRL RANGER went three then four wide on the first turn, stayed off the rail and came four wide into the stretch,
altered inside a rival at the eighth pole but lacked a late bid. DENDERA stalked in the two path to the stretch and failed to produce a rally. AT THE SPA
broke out, was forwardly placed outside a rival, exited the far turn four wide, tired and was eased to the wire and walked off. ROSE MADDOX off slow, broke
out and bumped rival, reserved in the early stages off the rail, angled out at the top of the lane, tired in the drive and was eased to the wire and walked off.
MUNNY PENNY got bumped from inside at the start, took the first turn five then six wide, remained well off the rail to the far turn and came six wide into the
stretch, had nothing left for the stretch run, eased to the wire and walked off.
