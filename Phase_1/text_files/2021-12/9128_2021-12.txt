Footnotes
HANDS OFF set the pace through the second turn while being prompted, shook free of IOWA HAWKEYE heading into the stretch and drew clear in the end
to prevail in a drive. BIG SWEDE broke awkwardly and was a bit rank in the early going, was three wide on the first turn, improved position while two wide
on the second turn and closed well in the stretch to earn the nod for the place in a blanket finish. EVEN STEVEN settled off of the pace while saving ground
early, mounted a three wide bid on the second turn and was outkicked in the drive, while just missing for second. TEX HANLEY was forwardly placed
through the second turn, saved ground throughout, and was outfinished in the stretch run. IOWA HAWKEYE was away alertly and pressed the pace through
the second turn, was turned away heading into the stretch run and weakened in the stretch. WOLF MOON WILSON was unhurried through the backstretch
run, saved ground on the second turn and was not a factor. THE CALABRESE KID chased the early pace into the first turn, lugged out along the first turn,
lost ground while four wide on the second turn and gave way in the late stages.

Footnotes
FLICFLAC settled off of the early pace while saving ground, was two wide on the turn, waited a bit for racing room at the head of the lane, angled in inside
of the furlong marker and made a late surge along the rail to prevail. BATTLE OF MEMPHIS (IRE) chased the early pace, mounted a five wide bid on the
turn to challenge the pacesetters, took the lead nearing the furlong marker, had a clear lead inside of the sixteenth marker but was challenged on the inside
by the winner and nailed on the wire, while clear of the rest. EVENEREVENWORSE was sent in the early going then took back into the turn, was three wide
on the turn while tracking the pace, vied for the lead into the stretch but was outfinished in the drive and held for third. HARBOR KITTY stalked the pace
from a three wide position on the turn and finished evenly in the stretch drive. I'M A COOL DUDE had no early speed, saved ground on the turn and lacked
a final kick in the stretch. LUCAS MCCAIN chased the early pace, was six wide on the turn, was still in aim leaving the turn and weakened in the drive.
GOLDENEYED tracked the early pace from a four wide path on the turn and faded in the stretch. ELUSIVE VIRTUE took over the early pace and set the
fractions into the turn while two wide, was confronted nearing the quarter-marker by EVENEREVENWORSE and gave way in the late going.

Footnotes
CAPE POINT sat just off of the early pace, was four wide on the first turn, was under a tight hold on the backstretch, mounted a four wide bid on the second
turn, lugged in several paths at the furlong marker and held over a closing runner-up to prevail. AMITY HARBOR sat off of the pace into the backstretch,
was four wide on the second turn, closed well in the late going and pressured the winner in the end but could not reel him in while holding for the place.
COLLUSION DELUSION was unhurried through the backstretch, was two wide on the second turn, rallied into the stretch and just missed for the place.
CHARMING VINTAGE stalked the pace while saving ground throughout, gained ground leaving the second turn, steadied at the furlong marker when CAPE
POINT lugged in and was outfinished in the drive. COJO was hustled to set moderately quick fractions through the second turn while saving ground, was
under pressure from CAPE POINT nearing the furlong marker when that rival lugged in, steadied leaving the eighth pole and tired in the stretch run. SLEEP
OVER stalked the moderately quick pace through the backstretch, was three wide on the second turn, was losing a bit of ground when forced to take up at
the furlong marker and lacked a late response. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO CAPE POINT LUGGING IN AT THE FURLONG
MARKER AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT CAPE POINT COST CHARMING VINTAGE, COJO AND SLEEP OVER THE OPPORTUNITY
FOR A BETTER PLACING AND DISQUALIFIED CAPE POINT FROM FIRST TO SIXTH.

Footnotes
SEA SAILOR settled off of the early pace, mounted a five wide bid on the turn, was kept to task in the lane under firm encouragement and found another
gear in the final sixteenth to surge past the runner-up to prevail. BOURBONWITHATWIST stalked the pace into the turn, mounted a two wide bid on the turn
to lead into the stretch drive, was clear in the final furlong but was tagged in the final stages by the winner while besting the rest. BY MOONLIGHT stalked
the pace from a four wide path on the turn and closed for third in the stretch run. IMISSBAYMEADOWS was hustled to duel on the front end with MAGIC
TIGER, kept up that battle through the turn, was caught by BOURBONWITHATWIST heading into the stretch and tired in the late going. MAGIC TIGER was
away alertly and was engaged by IMISSBAYMEADOWS for pace duties through the turn, lost ground leaving the turn and weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
DIRT FLIRT assumed command of the early fractions, was in a comfortable rhythm through the backstretch, saved ground throughout while steadily
increasing the lead and drew clear in the final stages. CASINO GAMES stalked the pace through the second turn, was asked for run nearing the
quarter-marker while losing ground to the winner, was no match for DIRT FLIRT in the stretch run but kept on to win the head nod for the place. LORETTA
was pinched at the start, stalked the pace through the second turn while saving ground and was outfinished by the runner-up in the late going to miss for the
place. SMILING SPIRIT was unhurried in the early going, was two wide on the second turn and did not have a late kick in the stretch run. SLEW OF
FASHION sat off of the pace through the backstretch, was three wide on the second turn and did not rally in the late going.

CLEM LABINE was unhurried in the early going, was two wide on the turn, was steered out to the six path for the drive, closed fast in the final sixteenth and
met COOL MOUNTAIN LAD on the line to share for the win. COOL MOUNTAIN LAD stalked the pace into the turn, gained ground while four wide on the
turn, vied for the lead inside of the furlong marker, kept on in the late going and held to dead heat for the win. TORPEDO AWAY chased the pace from a two
wide position on the turn, gained a bit of ground leaving the turn and finished evenly in the drive. KNOCKOUT BERT was away alertly and dueled on the
front end through the turn with CANNONBALL COMIN, vied for the lead leaving the turn and was outfinished in the stretch drive. CANNONBALL COMIN
dueled with KNOCKOUT BERT to carve out fractions through the turn, vied for the lead off of the turn and weakened in the stretch. PRINCE DE PRINCE
tracked the dueling pacesetters from a three wide path on the turn and tired in the stretch run. MEET THE SHERIFF was fractious in the starting gate and
was away slowly, was three wide while chasing from the rear on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SHERILINDA was three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace through the backstretch, was in tight quarters along the second turn while two wide, was
steered out to the four path for the drive, vied for the lead inside of the furlong marker and dug in in the late going to prevail. BUYBACK tracked the pace
through the backstretch and into the second turn while three wide, chased MISS SUPER SAINT into the stretch, battled back against the winner when she
came to terms nearing the sixteenth marker and was gamely bested while holding for the place. MISS SUPER SAINT was away in good order and set all of
the pace while being prompted by BUYBACK, felt pressure nearing the furlong marker and surrendered the lead at that point and was outfinished in the late
going while holding for third. REV REE was forwardly placed while saving ground throughout, attempted to split foes in mid-stretch but steadied in tight
nearing the sixteenth-marker and was outkicked in the late going. STYLEDOME (IRE) stalked the pace through the backstretch, was two wide on the
second turn and closed willingly in the drive. IMPERIAL CREED was unhurried through the run along the backstretch, was two wide on the second turn and
found her best stride in the late stages. DUTCH PAINTING (GB) was four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace through the backstretch, lost ground while
four wide on the second turn and weakened in the stretch drive. HURLEY stalked the pace from the second flight while saving ground and did not offer a
late bid in the stretch. I'M A ROCKETTE settled toward the rear of the field, was five wide on the second turn and was not a factor. MISTY CAT was
unprepared at the start and was unhurried in the early stages, was three wide while trailing on the second turn and was not a threat. LAST FIRST KISS
settled off of the early pace, lost ground while four wide on the second turn and faded in the late stages.

Footnotes
ROCKTILLYOUDROP tracked the pace from a two wide position through the second turn, wore down HONG KONG COWBOY leaving the second turn and
drove clear in the end. KNOWN was unhurried in the early stages, was four wide while still at the rear on the second turn, swung to six wide for the stretch
drive and while on the left lead closed in the late going to get the nod for second. BIG CITY BANE stalked the pace into the second turn, was two wide
between foes on the second turn and finished evenly in the late going, just missing for the place. LINFIELD was unhurried in the early stages, was three
wide on the second turn and closed willingly in the stretch run. HONG KONG COWBOY set the pedestrian pace while being prompted through the second
turn, was under pressure by the winner nearing the head of the lane and gave way in the stretch drive. ROCKY TOUGH made a middle move to improve
position along the backstretch, saved ground while improving position on the second turn but flattened out in the stretch drive.
