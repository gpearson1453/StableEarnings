Footnotes
SHASHKA tracked the early pace from between rivals, then eased out four wide leaving the quarter pole, made a bid leaving the turn, then was trying to lug
in by the furlong marker, was corrected and edged clear late to prove best under left handed crop urging. SHE'S A GUNFIGHTER pressed the early pace
and made a three wide bid to duel for command by the five sixteenths, then vied for command leaving the turn between rivals, then had a long drive but was
outfinished by the winner in a game effort. BET THE QUEEN set a pressured pace on the inside, then dueled for command on the turn, then stayed on
gamely on the inside to the wire to best the rest. HOPE EVER LASTING stalked the early pace four wide but lacked the needed rally while finishing evenly.
LIFE IS ETERNAL was allowed to settle early, came four wide into the drive but offered no rally. PEACEARELLA chased the pace on the inside and
weakened.

Footnotes
QUEEN ROSEMARY was reserved early, then was three wide by the quarter pole while starting to unwind, then split rivals leaving the three sixteenths,
angled in nearing the sixteenths pole, closed well up the inside to get up in time under a drive. NORA RADD set the early pace on the inside, then was
headed leaving the turn, then dug in gamely in the furlong grounds, led late but was denied. HONORABLE LILLY was bumped at the start, prompted the
pace and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, gained a short advantage by the furlong marker but hung late, held show award. WILL TAKE
ROSES was rated along the inside early, then eased out by the quarter pole and came four wide into the drive for aim on the front runner, rallied well but
needed more. BECCA'S WISH was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the drive and closed well late on the outside. TRIPP ROAD chased the early
pace and was four to five wide on the turn but had no punch. MERINO WOOL weakened.

Footnotes
INDIGESTION was away alertly and sent to the front to set an unchallenged pace on the inside, was well handled, drew clear in the drive to prove best
under left handed crop urging. POCOPSON STATION was rated along two wide early, advanced on the far turn and then swung out four wide for the drive
but failed to gain on the winner while clearly second best. TOP HAT TREASON was four wide into the first turn, then settled four wide down the backstretch,
made a bid on the turn and came five wide into the drive but came up empty, bested rest. RANDOM THOUGHTS was allowed to settle early, then was on
the inside on the turn and had no response. SYNERGIZED was off a step slow, then went up to stalk the pace three wide, was asked around the five
sixteenths and tired.
