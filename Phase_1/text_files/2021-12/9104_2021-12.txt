Footnotes
WILLIAM BOY settled off the trio contesting the early pace while racing in the clear inside, cruised up three wide around the far turn, took over nearing the
lane, drifted out badly under right-handed urging, straightened out in about the eleven path in midstretch and held sway. I GEN saved ground off the early
pace, advanced three wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and rallied between foes for the place. PERPETUAL CHANGE was off
a bit slow, raced off the pace two wide, shifted out in upper stretch and rallied between foes. FORTY FLASH prompted the pace three wide, took the lead
nearing the far turn, dueled two wide around the far turn, was collard near the quarter pole, fought on inside to deep stretch but was outfinished.
SHIMMERING LIGHT saved ground off the pace and never threatened. NEVERENOUGHCOCO failed to menace while racing three wide. CLAUDE RAY
was forced to checked when in tight early, saved ground off the pace, went four wide around the far turn and made little impact. BYE BYE DAVID checked
soon after the start, raced three and four wide and played no factor. SIR TERRE pressed the pace between foes for five furlongs, dueled inside around the
far turn and tired in the drive. HONESTO set the pace along the rail and retreated around the far turn.

Footnotes
OLD TIME REVIVAL broke outward, hustled through to take over inside DR. DOYLE and LIFE IN SHAMBLES leaving the chute, gave those two the slip
after a half-mile and widened under pressure. LIFE IN SHAMBLES forced the early pace outside OLD TIME REVIVAL and DR. DOYLE, could not keep
pace with the leader coming off the turn, but stayed on well enough to get the place. AWESOME BEACH saved ground behind the leading trio heading to
the turn, got roused after a half but could not make headway on OLD TIME REVIVAL, ran on evenly inside rivals late and salvaged the show. PERFECTLY
MAJESTIC saved ground outrun to the stretch, altered course leaving the furlong grounds and showed some late interest outside the top three. JUPITER
BLUES was no factor two to three wide. ITALIAN CHARM was bothered by OLD TIME REVIVAL out of the gate and spotted the field three lengths or so,
and never recovered. DR. DOYLE led briefly before being overtaken by OLD TIME REVIVAL, chased between horses to the turn, and folded up.

Footnotes
LEFTHOOKLIGHTSOUT brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, led the field under a hold through the opening quarter of a mile, settled into
stride while continuing to show the way on the inside up what remained of the backstretch and around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off
down the lane. SANDY DUDE brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, recovered to press the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
continued to battle from the two path around the turn, could not go with the winner in the stretch and chased that rival home, holding second. BILLY YANK
chased the leaders on the inside through the opening half mile, began a mild bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, and improved position in
the stretch while proving to be no match for the winner. ZIGGY trailed the field on the outside in the early going, moved up racing into the turn, entered the
stretch three wide and passed tiring horses from there. KING FORCE bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the
pack for the run up the backstretch, raced two wide around the turn and was outkicked in the stretch. HIGHJUMP CHARLIE raced in the middle of the pack
on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and continued to fade down the lane. NONA RAC raced inside at
the back of the pack in the opening stages, dropped back to trail the field headed into the turn, saved ground from there and continued to tire in the stretch.
HIGHER LAW stumbled and lost his rider at the start, trailed the field around the oval, was caught near the wire and walked off. AN INQUIRY WAS MADE
INTO THE START. UPON REVIEW, THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
KOBLA MAS was outrun early, swung five wide rallying off the far turn, and rallied steadily outside to be along in time. BOHEMIAN BOY advanced three
wide around the far turn, challenged for command after six furlongs, came away with a short lead through midstretch, but was outkicked from there.
ANOTHER DUKE spotted the field three lengths or so at the start, trailed toward the inside for six furlongs, moved out into the stretch and rallied for a share.
HOLY EMPEROR took closer order after six furlongs, came five wide into the lane, and improved for the last major share. CARIBBEAN GOLD was
forwardly placed for six furlongs, and lacked the needed closing response. MAKER OF AN EMPIRE became fractious in the gate dislodging the rider, came
away without incident, and never factored. TIZ A PRINCE set the early pace inside, stayed on to midstretch and gave way. SPECIAL MEISTER saved
ground in midpack early, lacked room on the rail nearing the quarter-pole, and faded through the drive. MAYOR REMO contested the pace outside TIZ A
PRINCE, poked a head in front on the far turn, and tired in the stretch. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE. FRACTIONS OMITTED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.
FINAL TIME HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
SIR OLLIE pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, dueled on
the outside in upper stretch and pulled clear in the final furlong under a drive. TIGER led the field between horses in the opening quarter of a mile, continued
to show the way on the inside up what remained of the backstretch and around the turn, dueled from the rail in upper stretch, gave way near the eighth pole
and chased the eventual winner home, the best of the rest. AMPERSAND bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled in behind the leaders
on the outside for the run up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, and gained ground on the outside in
late stretch while never threatening the top two. NACHO PAPA stumbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to track the leaders on the inside up the
backstretch, improved position while saving ground around the turn, switched outside in upper stretch and finished evenly. MAN OF VISION bumped with
the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the inside through the opening half mile, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked in
the stretch. UNO TIGER raced off the pace between horses in the early going, navigated the turn from the two and three path, made a mild improvement of
position racing around the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
DIMENNA set a clear pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. GODS PROMISE broke outwardly, stalked the winner two wide, continued on the left
lead in the lane and was clearly second best. CAMP PENDLETON was shut off at the start, raced well back early, improved position four wide around the
turn but lacked the needed stretch rally. MACHO REAL raced off the pace two wide, swung five wide nearing the quarter pole and passed tiring rivals.
KLEON saved ground and failed to menace. HARD TEN played no factor while racing three wide. LORD DARNLEY was in range between foes down the
backstretch, angled to the rail near the three-eighths pole and retreated inside. WILD TEXAS TOM chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the
lane. POLITICAL RIOT was in range four wide and retreated through the lane. HIERRO played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
STRIKE THE TOP bobbled slightly at the start, began taking closer order around the far turn three then four wide, rallied to the lead outside rivals with a
furlong remaining and edged away late. TIMMY M. was unhurried for six furlongs, came three wide into the lane and finished willingly inside SMALL HOPE
to get up for the place. SMALL HOPE lacked room inside TIMMY M. heading to the first turn, circled five wide approaching the stretch, and needed more
late on the far outside. GOLDEN DECISION battled up front between horses to the stretch, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile inside.
AMBASSADOR JIM went up to force the pace outside rivals up the backstretch, stayed on fighting for the lead between rivals through upper stretch, then
gave way. GRAN MALBEC went along between horses in the second flight early, and had no closing response. UNMATCHABLE went up to contest the
pace outside rivals on the first turn, moved in with the lead to the backstretch, vied inside foes around the far turn, and faltered into the stretch. SPINNING
KITTEN raced close up inside for a half-mile, and dropped back steadily before completing six furlongs.

middle of the pack on the outside, began a bid from the three path nearing the three eighths pole, gained ground on the outside down the lane and got up in
the final strides. SERENADE A KITTEN raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from
the three path racing around the turn, dueled between horses under a drive down the stretch and was caught late. GRAND AVE GIRL was away from the
gate a step slowly, quickly recovered to press the pace from the two path around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, took over to lead
while racing in the two path around the far turn, continued to battle in upper stretch and gave way in the final sixteenth of a mile. MIRABELL MEI saved
ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, began to improve position while racing in the three path around the far turn, and continued to
gain ground on the outside in late stretch. OMNIA raced in tight quarters while saving ground around the first turn, chased the leaders on the inside up the
backstretch, moved out to the two path while running around the far turn, and flattened out in the stretch. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN bumped with the horse to
her outside leaving the gate, navigated the first turn from the two path, raced between horses in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, came around the
far turn still in the two path and weakened in the final furlong. DOUBLE BLESSED saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the
inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the second turn and continued to fade from there. DESIGNED BY KITTEN

CLASSICSTATEOFMIND set the pace along the rail, drew off in upper stretch and continued to widen while ridden out. LIVING WATER bumped at the
start, raced off the pace two wide and finished willingly inside of foes to gain the place in the final strides. MAGNILOQUENT prompted the winner two wide
and tired in the final sixteenth. SPACE RUNNER bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide and was outfinished for the minor awards. ASTRAL RIDE
failed to menace while racing three wide. POWERFUL GUY was outrun inside. BANKER'S HOURS had early speed inside, checked nearing the turn and
had no further bids. FORGRINSNCHUCKLES was bumped between rivals at the start, raced erratically, was pulled up down the backstretch and trotted off.
RUN UP UNAVAILABLE. FRACTIONAL TIMES OMITTED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION. FINAL TIME HAND-TIMED.
