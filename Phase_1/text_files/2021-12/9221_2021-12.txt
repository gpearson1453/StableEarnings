Footnotes
GRAND PRIORITY broke a beat slowly and was last away, settled far off of the pace, took the turn three wide before being floated five wide entering the
lane, then rallied outside of foes through the final furlong, and reeled in the stopping leader in the final sixteenth. FLUFFPOINT bumped an inner foe at the
start, set the pace from a pair of pressing rivals, repelled those foes' bid at the quarter pole, drew off through upper stretch, but weakened noticeably in the
final furlong, was reeled in the final sixteenth, and just lasted for place. ADIEU LE CHAT took a bump from an outer foe at the start, raced off of the pace two
wide around the turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, lugged inwardly while hanging on his left lead as he bid for place in midstretch, but was outkicked
by an outer rival in the final furlong, kept on, but missed reaching the weakening early pace setter for place. KINGSTON STREET laid at the rear of the field
along the inside, and improved inside of foes in the final furlong. BENBOW CAT tracked along the inside, bid for place inside of tiring foes at the furlong
grounds, but flattened out, and faded. DOUBLE YOU stalked three wide, bid for the lead entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with the leader at the
quarter pole, faltered shortly after, and weakened. PRIMEINTERESTRATE pressed the pace two wide and between horses, ranged up to bid entering the
lane, but weakened on his left lead in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CRIME SPREE stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the dueling pair into the turn, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, assumed control while
well in hand passing the quarter pole, and drew off under light hand urging. TWIRLING ROSES chased four wide around the turn, came into the lane five
wide, hung on his left lead while staying on to vie for place through the final furlong, and prevailed over an inner foe for that position. ABUELO NUNO laid at
the rear along the inside, split foes two wide passing the three sixteenths pole to bid for place at the furlong grounds, but was outfinished by an outer rival.
GEMO RAIN laid off of the pace, tucked two wide into the turn, moved between horses turning for home before shifting four wide entering the lane, but only
managed to chase, vied for place between foes through the closing stages, but flattened and missed show. MURDO dueled for the lead inside of a rival, met
the eventual winner's bid turning for home, but proved no match for that foe at the quarter pole, then weakened in midstretch. LODE OF BLARNEY dueled
for the lead two wide, then from between horses turning for home, but weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
PICKING ROSES settled off of the pace in the three path around the first turn, shifted two to three wide around the far turn, then five wide in upper stretch,
rallied outside of foes through the lane to bid for the lead passing the sixteenth pole, and got up late. HAY DAKOTA trailed early on, took the far turn in the
two path before splitting foes two wide passing the quarter pole, sustained a rally to bid for the lead along the rail entering the final furlong, battled thereafter,
but was outfinished by an outer foe, and just reached place. NEW EAGLE rated off of the pace along the inside, tracked two wide around the far turn before
swinging four wide entering the lane, rallied to bid at the three sixteenths pole, shifted inwardly while inching clear of inner foes passing at the furlong
grounds, led as a pair of rivals on either side produced bids approaching the final sixteenth, but was bested by those foes late. THE GREEN MO'STER set
the pace, showed the way from a pair of pressing foes into the far turn, met their bids at the five sixteenths pole, dug in while shifting off of the rail at the
quarter pole, but gave way between horses at the furlong pole. BARLEEWON stalked three wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, but was
outkicked by rivals on either side at the three sixteenths pole while chasing his pace-setting entry-mate, and yielded. WAR CHEST pressed the pace two
wide, then from between horses into the far turn, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, then weakened entering the lane. JURISDICTION tracked along
the inside after taking the first turn in the two path, then faded turning for home.

Footnotes
CHEROKEE TAKEOVER settled far off of the pace along the inside, commenced his rally turning for home while shifting two wide, outkicked outer foes
before sweeping past the leading dueling pair at the furlong pole, and finished strongly to the wire. NICE STAR broke outwardly, tracked the pace two wide,
shifted three wide in upper stretch, but was outkicked by a rallying an inner rallying foe approaching the furlong grounds, then kept on to secure place. MY
LITTLE LEO took the turn in midpack three wide, got floated four wide entering the lane, then stayed on mildly outside of tiring foes to reach show a
sixteenth from home, and held that position from an inner foe late. RY DONT LIE loaded rider-less, then was crowded between horses at the start, got
caught in the five path while far off of the pace, then improved through the final furlong, but missed reaching an outer foe for show. MR. K W vied along the
inside of YOUNG TUSCAN early on, allowed that foe to clear approaching the half mile pole. shifted outside of that foe at that marker to stalk, re-bid
entering the lane, dueled through upper stretch while exchanging brushes with his inner counterpart from the three-sixteenths to the furlong grounds, but
was swiftly surpassed by an outer surging foe at the furlong pole, and yielded. YOUNG TUSCAN sped clear after a furlong, dug in entering the lane as MR.
K W bid, dueled with that foe while exchanging brushes through upper stretch, but was overhauled by an outer foe at the furlong grounds, and tired.
GTUONE BUCK chased along the inside, but failed to produce a bid, and faded. SOLAR STAR broke outwardly and bumped the gate at the start, then got
outrun. SURPRISE SOLUTION chased while off of the pace in the four path around the turn, but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
EAST LEX tracked from midpack three wide, gained four wide turning for home before being floated five wide entering the lane, but sustained a rally to take
aim on a clear ULTIMATE IRONY in upper stretch, bid at the furlong grounds, dueled with that foe to the wire, and prevailed. ULTIMATE IRONY stalked
along the inside while in the two path, awaited racing room turning for home before smoothly splitting the leaders at the quarter pole, surged clear soon after
as EAST LEX pursued, resisted that foe's bid at the furlong grounds, gamely dueled with that rival to the wire, but was bested. ZOFFA rated far off of the
pace in the two path around both turns, rallied among rivals while shifting four wide approaching the final three sixteenths, gained show leaving the furlong
grounds, and chased the dueling pair home. HELLUVA LIFE laid off of the pace two wide, got floated seven wide in upper stretch, and stayed on outside of
foes for a minor share. OKUDAH vied for the lead two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, but drifted to the three path entering the lane,
then yielded on his left lead in upper stretch. THUNDER AHEAD broke inwardly, stalked three wide, allowed an outer foe to produce an early bid down the
backstretch while sustaining stalking stride, then shifted six wide in upper stretch for clear sailing, but lacked a rally. IBEAM set the pace along the inside of
a vying foe around the first turn, then inside of a pair of foes around the far turn, but gave way at the quarter pole, and weakened. KILLER BEE was
unprepared for the start with his head turned to the left when the gates opened, then came out slowly, trailed the field, shifted four wide in midstretch, and
improved. CHIEF ALPHA tracked two wide, produced an early four wide move to vie for the lead at the half mile pole, sustained vying position three wide
around the far turn, but was floated back four wide entering the lane, and weakened in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead. NO KA OI laid off of the
pace four to three wide, and failed to factor. FLASHY RICHIE broke a step slowly, saved ground in midpack, but faded through the lane.

Following the field needing to be backed-out of the gates due to loading before post-time, BELGRADE stalked the leading pair along the inside down the
backstretch, set up shop outside of those foes at the three furlong pole, ranged up to them passing the quarter pole, swept past at the three-sixteenths
under a mild drive, and was ridden out to the wire. TEE BURNS pressed two wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by an outer
foe at the three sixteenths pole, then held place. GOLDEN LUNA took a mild bump from an outer foe at teh start, set teh pace along the inside, resisted a
rival's bid turning for home, but gave way to that foe an the eventual winner at the three sixteenths pole. RUNANDHIDE WIND bumped with an inner foe at
the start, and never got involved. ACHILLES showed little.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT TEA TIME tracked from midpack in the two path, stalked around the far turn, rallied inside of MR HUSTLE in upper stretch, but while being
herded to the rail by that foe at the furlong grounds, forged an advantage while taking a sold bump from that foe at the sixteenth pole, flopped back to his left
lead shortly after, and held. MR. HUSTLE stalked along the inside early on, ranged up outside of the clear leader to press into the turn, bid entering the lane,
led while drifting to the five path in upper stretch, shifted back inwardly at the furlong pole as an inner MIDNIGHT TEA TIME bid, lugged into that foe and
bumped him squarely while getting headed a sixteenth from home, flopped back to his left lead in the process, and was bested. HIERARCHY broke a step
slowly at the start due to shuffling his feet as the gates opened, trailed the field, took the far turn after shifting from the four to three path, then swung six
wide and outside of foes approaching midstretch, rallied to gain show in the final sixteenth, and was gaining on the leading pair late. BIG AGENDA broke a
step slowly before being put to tight quarters between horses at the start, settled far off of the pace two wide, tracked in the four path around the far turn,
gained in upper stretch to reach show at the furlong grounds, but was surpassed for that position in the final sixteenth. HENLEY'S JOY saved ground while
well off of the pace, and failed to factor. STRIKE ME DOWN tracked three wide, but faded between horses in upper stretch. ENTERTAINMENT broke
inwardly, but sped clear early on, came back to the field into the far turn, dug in turning for home as MR HUSTLE bid, then got headed by that foe in upper
stretch, and weakened.

Footnotes
ZION pressed the pace two wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole while feeling JANETS JAY JAY's outer presence, forged an advantage as that foe menaced
in upper stretch, but repelled that foe at the furlong grounds, and readily kicked clear. JANETS JAY JAY stalked three wide, ranged up turning for home to
bid for the lead outside of ZION in upper stretch, but was repelled while proving no match for that foe at the furlong pole, and was second best. BIG BRASS
MONKEY set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pair of outer bidding foes turning for home, but gave way to them at the three sixteenths
pole. FOOLISH DREAMS tracked the pace while shifting from the four to three path into the turn, tipped back four wide entering the lane, but only managed
to chase the leaders thereafter, and failed to threaten. BOURBON ST TAPPIN laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, but failed to make an
impact. TOTALLY ADDICTED trailed in the four path around the turn, and got outrun. JUSTA SWINGING laid off of the pace along the inside, came under
urging into the turn to sustain rail position, then saved ground around the bend, but faded through the lane.

Footnotes
OWN AGENDA bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked the pace two wide, tipped three wide into the far turn, ranged up to the leaders while well in
hand turning for home, forged an advantage in upper stretch, kicked clear at the furlong grounds, and held sway from a chasing rival late. ATTORNEY TIM
bumped with an inner rival at the start, settled far off of the pace along the inside, saved ground before tipping three wide entering the lane, rallied between
horses in upper stretch, claimed place a sixteenth out with a few lengths to find on the leader, and chased that foe home. BEACHCOMBING stalked the
run-away leader two wide, closed in on that foe down the backstretch, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole as OWN AGENDA loomed a danger, but
was outkicked by that foe in upper stretch, yielded passing the furlong pole, then lost place a sixteenth from home. TWOKO BAY broke inwardly, settled far
off of the pace two wide, tracked around the far turn before shifting four wide entering the lane, but lacked a kick and failed to menace. COVE BLUE ran off
into the first turn, settled entering the backstretch, saw foes close in into the far turn, met a pair of bids at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened in upper
stretch. FOREVER MO stalked along the inside, tracked comfortably from the pocket around the far turn, but was outmoved while awaiting racing room
turning for home, shifted two wide entering the lane, but came up empty, and faded. FORTUITY trailed, shifted three wide into the backstretch, but failed to
factor.

Footnotes
SPECTACULAR IZZY was bumped by an inner foe at the start, stalked two wide, got floated three wide entering the lane, produced a bid at the three
sixteenths pole between horses, led passing that marker, and held to the wire. VERRAZANO ISLAND tracked along the inside, slipped through a rail
opening in upper stretch, chased outer foes into the final sixteenth, attempted a late bid, but was denied. ENOUGH HEART was pinched back at the start as
an inner rival crossed over, saved ground off of the pace, rallied while shifting four wide entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, but was repelled in the final
furlong, and leveled off. MISSBUDLITELIME stalked the run off leader along the inside, inherited an advantage at the three furlong pole, shifted to the two
path entering the lane, but weakened between horses at the three sixteenths pole. ALLSTAR MAGIC tracked the pace three wide and between horses, but
faded at the five sixteenths pole. SMOOTHOUTTHETRACK broke a bit outwardly at the start, and never got involved. KOHENSRISING got caught four
wide while off of the pace around the turn, then was floated six wide entering the lane, and faded. FLASHY SASSY veered outwardly at the start into outer
rivals, ran off down the backstretch while steadily lugging outwardly under a tight rein, but failed to make the turn, bolted at the three furlong pole, got pulled
up turning for home after avoiding the outer railing, then walked off.
