Footnotes
CANDY CRUSHEM broke readily, was rated between foes off the first flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide after a half while being prompted
to advance, continued with a steady bid outside a rival to gain a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch, then kicked clear late under pressure while
being taken in hand once the issue was decided approaching the wire. TAPSOLUTE, in touch with the leaders three deep racing into the first turn, pressed
the issue after a half to gain a narrow advantage, dueled inside the eventual winner through the far turn, resisted that foe to midstretch and yielded late.
DOCTOR D J, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, switched out racing into the far turn, angled four wide in upper stretch to gain some
position but finished evenly late. SHAKEM N BREAKEM, forwardly placed along the rail tracking just inside the leaders in the opening half, steadily faded
into the stretch. CHINOMADITO made brief pursuit of the leaders four wide racing to the backstretch and emptied out after a half. WHISTLE ME HOME,
urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset to the backstretch, was headed after a half and steadily faded racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
NOTHINS FREE broke readily to gain the advantage, disputed the pace shifting well off the rail racing into the turn, forged clear entering the stretch under
firm encouragement and was gathered up in the final stages while widening the advantage. SUSIKIN was urged to terms prompting the pacesetter through
the backstretch into the turn, gave way when failing to match the winner entering the stretch, then held a rival for the place honors at the wire. BABY BEE
MERRY, bumped at the start, switched outside foes early to track the leaders three wide on the backstretch, angled out four wide nearing upper stretch but
continued with interest to just miss for second. TURING MACHINE tracked the leaders between foes in second flight in the opening stages, faded entering
the turn, then shifted out while being roused to produce a second effort in the closing stages. GIVEITSOMEWELLIE tracked the leaders four wide on the
backstretch, angled inwards to race outside a rival on the turn but gave way in the drive. OFFLEE IRISH ducked out at the start, trailed the field to the
stretch and responded to firm encouragement late to edge a rival along the rail nearing the wire. RUNFASTANDLOUD broke outwards bumping BABY BEE
MERRY, was righted to track the leaders along the inside to the turn and gave way into the lane.

Footnotes
LADY IN HEELS broke sharply, was urged to force the pace outside a rival through the backstretch, forged clear racing into the turn, then steadily widened
the advantage through the stretch while being kept to right handed encouragement. STARE IF YOU MUST angled inwards in the opening stages to track
the leaders between foes, worked her way to the rail nearing the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest inside foes to prevail for the
place honors. MURUMBI broke readily to race in touch between the leaders in the opening stages, was eased off the pace to track between foes, shifted out
four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with an effort to gain some position while earning a share. KATIES A LADY shifted off the rail while breaking
readily, was urged inside rivals disputing the pace through the backstretch, couldn't match terms with the winner racing into the bend and gave way nearing
the lane. LADY WOOD tracked the leaders four wide in early stages, shifted inwards to race between foes on the turn but came up empty in the drive.
RIPLEY EFFECT, off slowly, was settled along the rail in the opening stages, switched outside foes midway through the backstretch to race four wide into
the bend but offered no rally. STARSHIP MACYS angled to the inside in the opening stages tracking the leaders, dropped out of contention early. BAD AND
BEAUTIFUL proved no factor.

LAST PROMISE was prompted to a contending position four wide into the first turn, eased off the leaders to track those foes outside rivals on the
backstretch, advanced on the pacesetter three deep racing into the far turn, pressed the issue past midstretch and narrowly prevailed in time under firm
handling. SANCOCHO (MEX) broke inwards bumping SMART N INTUITIVE at the start, was urged three deep prompting the pacesetter racing to the first
turn, tracked that rival in that path racing into the backstretch, moved to press the issue outside the leader entering the far turn, gained a narrow advantage
nearing upper stretch, then grudgingly resisted the winner to the end while just failing to contain that rival. HIGH FIVE COTTON, off slowly, was reserved
while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, eased back off rivals before a half, switched outside foes to race four wide into the far turn while being
prompted to advance but lacked the needed closing response while edging a rival for a share. CAUSALISTIC settled three deep in the last flight racing to
the first turn, pulled his way to contention between foes in that path on the backstretch, lost some position nearing the lane but continued evenly between
foes to late stages. PROFESSIONAL, bumped at the start while forced inwards bumping END ALL GET ALL soundly at the start, was urged along the rail
prompting the leader into the first turn, tracked just off that foe inside rivals on the backstretch and gave way racing through the far turn. SMART N
INTUITIVE, bumped at the start while being forced into PROFESSIONAL, was righted, then urged between foes setting the pace into the backstretch,
dueled along the inside to upper stretch and gave out late. END ALL GET ALL, bumped soundly while knocked off stride at the start, settled last racing to
the backstretch and never menaced thereafter.

Footnotes
LAP OF LUXURY was rated outside a rival tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance in the opening half, shifted three wide racing into the far
turn advancing on the leaders, pressed the issue in that path racing into the stretch while striking the front and just maintained a narrow advantage to the
end under pressure. MISS Z, bumped soundly at the start, switched outside rivals leaving the chute to race off the second flight, was prompted to advance
four wide into the far turn, moved to terms with the leaders in that path entering the lane and continued willingly to edge a rival for the place honors. READY
TO FILM, off slowly, was prompted to split foes gaining a position stalking just outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, advanced on the leader to
press the issue between foes on the far turn, dueled inside the top pair past midstretch but yielded nearing the wire. EISWEIN ducked inwards slightly at the
start while being taken in hand, was rated off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, gained some position three deep nearing the far turn, briefly
awaited an opening entering the second bend, was prompted to advance between foes in that path to the stretch, shifted about in search of an opening
racing past midstretch, then finished under firm restraint through the final sixteenth when lacking a path from which to advance. NOVELERA, reserved near
the rear of the field while angling to the rail racing to the first turn, continued last to the far turn, swung out five wide racing through the stretch and made
some belated progress. RUNAWAY BREEZE angled to the rail tracking the leaders as part of the second flight in the opening stages, tipped out midway
through the backstretch to race between foes into the far turn, was prompted to advance while caught in tight quarters racing into upper stretch and lacked
the needed final kick. MOLLIES HOPE broke readily, sped clear while angling to the rail racing to the first turn, dueled inside foes through the far turn and
gave out racing into upper stretch. LITTLE MISS SASSY broke inwards bumping MISS Z, was collected to race off the second flight, was prompted to make
an early advance inside foes when presented an opening on the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, then was shuffled back avoiding a tiring foe
racing into upper stretch while quickly giving way. HIGH ARABIAN was settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and proved no threat.

TRULY AMBITIOUS broke readily, was urged to gain a clear advantage setting the pace racing off the rail through the backstretch, then held sway through
the stretch under firm encouragement. CAJUN SPICE, bumped soundly at the start, was righted quickly to gain a position just off the leaders while angling
to the inside tracking those rivals, saved ground through the bend, then was urged to bid inside the leader midstretch but couldn't gain even terms with that
foe while prevailing for the place honors. SHES ASTYLISH KATZ tipped out early stalking the pacesetter through the backstretch, shifted three wide racing
into the stretch while being prompted to advance but finished evenly late. TETON THAI tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight, shifted four wide
entering the stretch but offered no rally. MISCHIEF REIGNS tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn, angled to the inside nearing upper
stretch but had no closing bid. C'EST PARTI settled outside foes dropping well off the leaders, was prompted to advance angling five wide in the stretch and
continued evenly. MORENA DANCER shied outwards at the start was settled into stride and passed only tiring rivals. POWERFUL NATIVE settled inside
foes in early stages and failed to menace thereafter. LOVIN MY SWEET T proved no factor. UNDERCOVER OUTLAW swerved out at the break bumping
CAJUN SPICE and dropped out early.

Footnotes
AMERICAN D'ORO was rated off the second flight while being carried out approaching the first turn, tracked the pace outside foes settling well off the
second flight on the backstretch, was prompted to advance three wide on the far turn, angled four wide racing into upper stretch and produced a solid
closing response to wrest the advantage in time under firm handling. FLY LIKE AN EAGLE, held up off the second flight leaving the chute, drifted out racing
into the first turn, was prompted to advance three wide racing into the far turn, couldn't match the winner late but prevailed for second. FEBRUARY SON
settled outside foes dropping out last to the backstretch, gained position leaving the far turn, was fanned five wide midstretch but continued with interest to
improve position to the end. PIRATE PARADE sprinted clear along the rail to the backstretch, held sway on clear margin to the stretch but gave out late.
PICASSO tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight to the backstretch but offered no closing bid. BEAR CREEK, caught in close quarters inside
rivals tracking the pacesetter in second flight for the opening five furlongs, faded into the stretch. RIDE EM, caught four wide leaving the chute tracking the
pacesetter to the backstretch, shifted in nearing the second bend while being urged to lodge a brief bid but emptied out nearing the lane. THOMOND PARK,
reserved near the inside in the opening half, switched outside foes racing into the far turn but offered no rally. STYNER drifted out into racing the turn while
being rated off the second flight and dropped back early. STUNNING BABY was a brief factor three wide between foes in second flight tracking the
pacesetter to the backstretch but emptied out after a half.

Footnotes
PROVOCATEUR broke readily, attended a rival's pace through the backstretch, pressed the issue nearing upper stretch and was roused clear left handed
through the final three sixteenths to prove best. SURPASSING settled off the second flight while angling nearer to the inside racing through the backstretch,
shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance and proved best of the others. GIANT'S FIRE tracked just off the leaders
between rivals racing to the turn, shifted out three wide entering the stretch but lacked the needed final kick. DUBROVNIK, a bit outpaced in early stages,
angled out four wide racing into the stretch and displayed some belated interest. DORSODURO, urged to gain a position inside rivals in the second flight,
tipped outside a tiring foe racing into the stretch but steadily faded. ONE COOL DUDE was hustled up the rail in the opening stages disputing the pace on a
narrow advantage, dueled for command through the turn and gave way into upper stretch. ACTION DREAM broke awkwardly dropping well off the leaders
and failed to menace thereafter. EXACTING, off a bit slowly when caught in tight quarters at the start, never mounted a serious challenge. LINO'S KID
ducked inwards at the start crossing over the path of EXACTING, was urged in brief pursuit of the leaders three deep to the turn but dropped out early.

Footnotes
ZERENIA was rated off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling between foes through the far turn, shifted
out four wide racing into upper stretch and produced a steady late response to just edge FALL MOON in time under firm handling. The latter tracked the
leaders from out of striking distance outside a rival as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, steadily gathered momentum shifting three deep
nearing upper stretch to close the gap on the leaders, moved to wrest command in that path leaving the furlong marker but couldn't fend off the winner.
