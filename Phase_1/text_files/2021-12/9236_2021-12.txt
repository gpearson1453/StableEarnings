Footnotes
IMAGINE GOLD bumped with rival at the start then quickly cleared and crossed over to show the way into first turn, set the pace up the backstretch and
widened advantage around the far turn, came under a ride two wide turning for home, had plenty left in reserve and continued to pull away. LOCASH raced
two wide around the first turn and tracked the top two leaders up the backstretch, launched a two wide bid on the far turn, remained in pursuit through the
stretch run and finished second best. SPECIAL CONQUEST saved ground around the first turn, tracked the pacesetter up the backstretch, urged along the
rail around the far turn, remained near the inside through the lane and cleared the rest. FANCY SKY was allowed to settle through early stages, headed in
pursuit three wide midway around the far turn, edged a bit closer then weakened while drifting in slightly through the lane. MAGIC SOLUTION was off slow
at the start and spotted the field two lengths, remained reserved in the back, hustled up inside through the far turn and failed to move into contention.
PRINCESS CONSUELA bumped with rival at the start, was forwardly placed around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to fade late on the far turn,
and continued to tire through the lane.

Footnotes
BEHAVIN MYSELF raced three wide around the first turn and rated off the pacesetter through early stages, picked up the pace entering the far turn, closed
the gap on the leader mid-way through the lane, stayed on determinedly driving two wide and edged away late. LARK held a slim lead around the first turn,
then widened to a clear advantage through the backstretch, remained well clear around the far turn, continued to hold onto a diminishing lead in the final
furlong, then got reeled in late. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE raced three wide into the first turn, settled off the early pace, was ridden along four wide into the lane,
shifted inside under right handed pressure and bested the rest. OFF TO THE BEACH was reserved and raced in the last flight, picked up the pace on the
rail around the far turn, cut the corner into the lane and improved position without threatening. FUTURE VISION raced midpack and saved ground through
the backstretch, angled out around the far turn and failed to move on. KING ZION raced outside in the last flight, came three to four wide into the lane and
never menaced. WHERE'S FREDO tracked the pace on the inside up the backstretch, then faded late on the far turn. SWEET TONIC was forwardly placed
chasing the leader and came up empty after a half.

Footnotes
NIFF sped to the lead at the start, held firm around the turn, then came two wide into the lane, widened advantage still racing in hand, came under a hand
ride in the final furlong and remained well clear. FABULOUS PHILLY was forwardly placed outside of the winner around the turn, sustained a steady two to
three wide bid through the stretch run and cleared second best. WEDDING BOURBON raced inside off the top pair around the turn, cut the corner into the
lane, sustained a steady inside bid under firm pressure and prevailed for a share. TENSE raced off the second flight entering the turn, was ridden along
three to four wide into the lane and needed more for late impact. MY BACK PAGES raced off the early speed, hustled along two wide into the lane and
lacked a needed rally. FRIEND raced outside off the early speed, fanned wide into the lane and never threatened. DRAGONFLY KISSES raced off the
pace, saved ground around the turn, shifted three wide for the drive and had no response. SNOWCREST failed to move into contention.

LUCKY SHOT sped to the lead at the start, held a slim lead on top over IZU IZ OR IZU AINT through early stages, cleared on top late on the turn, came
three wide into the lane, found another gear under pressure and drew off in the final furlong. BIRDMAN RICHIE saved ground around the turn, angled out
two to three wide at the head of the lane, sustained a steady bid and captured place. IZU IZ OR IZU AINT applied pace pressure to LUCKY SHOT through
the early going, hustled along two wide into the lane, then inside, flattened out and lost place. DARE GOES DA DEVIL raced off the early speed, was ridden
along the outside into the lane and lacked a needed rally. SAMARITA chased the top pair around the turn then gave way.

SPINSTER ROAD raced off the early pace, hustled up leaving the turn, was set down five wide for the drive, steadily edged up closer and got up in final
strides. TALIS PARK GRAD sped to the lead at the start and showed the way around the turn, remained near the inside under right handed pressure in the
upper stretch, came under a left handed drive and shifted out several paths in late stages, impeded the progress of VENTIAN DREAMS and got edged out
for the win. ANDREW THE GIANT raced in the last flight, swung wide into the lane, rallied into contention, then surged gamely to the wire but ran out of
time. VENETIAN DREAM raced in contention off the top pair through the turn, was ridden along three wide into the lane, began to edge up closer between
rivals in the final sixteenth then lost path and forced to be taken up when TALIS PARK GRAND drifted out in deep stretch. PACHI was forwardly placed just
off the early leader, continued a two wide bid past the furlong marker, then weakened late. TRY TRY AGAIN raced off the pace, saved ground through the
turn, came off the inside at the head of the lane and failed to kick on. SUPER SILVER chased in contention along the outside around the turn, then
weakened in the lane. AFTER AN INQUIRY STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED TALIS PARK GRAD FROM SECOND AND PLACED FOURTH FOR DRIFTING

UNBURNT was forwardly placed three wide around the first turn, moved up in early backstretch and vied three deep for the lead, continued near equal
terms through the far turn, battled on gamely outside of WHITE LIES in deep stretch, dug in determinedly and got a head by in final strides. WHITE LIES
vied inside around the first turn, dueled inside a duo up the backstretch, continued to battle inside of UNBURNT in deep stretch, stayed on gamely along the
rail and got denied in final strides. SENSE OF SELF was reserved racing in the back, swung out wide into the lane, rallied along the outside and got a head

furlong marker and kicked clear. RIP IT RYAN raced four to five wide into the first turn, remained outside and rated off the early pace, swung wide into the
lane, set down for the drive under strong right handed pressure, came in a couple paths and rallied to gain place. CONI'S COUP broke through the gate but
was held by the assistant starter, settled off the early pace, moved up four wide late on the far turn, shifted to the inside in the final furlong and captured
show. MOVE ON OVER grew fractious when inside rival broke through the gate, rated outside off the early pace, moved up three wide to challenge for the
lead on the far turn, dueled past the furlong marker then lacked closing response. COWBOYS FEATHER set a pressured pace through the backstretch,
dueled for the lead past the furlong marker and came up tired in deep stretch. EASTON ROCKS raced in the back, angled inside near the furlong marker
and lacked a needed rally. BRAVO BRAVO pressed the pace through the backstretch, began to weaken late on the far turn and continued to tired through
the lane. PRINCE OF MAYHEM raced two wide around the first turn, rated off the top trio up the backstretch and gave way late on the far turn. CACHACO
raced up close three wide through the backstretch and came up empty around the far turn. THE HALF MILE TIME WAS HAND TIMED

angled in closer from the outside, was forwardly placed around the turn, continued a steady bid for the leader through the lane and had to settle for second
best. EL MAS LOCO got bumped and steadied just after the start, raced off the pace, came four wide into the lane, took closer order, shifted to the rail near
the furlong marker and secured show. YALIKEANYTHING was well reserved racing in the back, saved ground through the turn, shifted out in the upper
stretch, finished with interest but ran out of time. SKIP THE SMALLTALK chased the pace near midpack through early stages, was ridden along four wide at
the eighth pole and chased on evenly. MAGIC MAN'S TOUCH raced near midpack through early stages, hustled up three wide through the turn and failed
to kick on in the lane. MIND YOUR OWN BIZ was forwardly placed through early stages, continued a bid into upper stretch then flattened out. CHARLES T
raced off the pace, came out two to three wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. BRAVO EXPRESS chased outside through early stages, swung wide
entering the lane and failed to move on. W W RUSSIAN GOLD raced off the pace, saved ground through the turn and never threatened. SMILING SILAS
raced near midpack through early stages and came up empty in the upper stretch.
