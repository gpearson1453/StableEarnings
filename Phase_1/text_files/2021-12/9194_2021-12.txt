Footnotes
WIDDLE ZEE vied inside of CUSTOM SIERRA early on, cleared that rival passing the half mile pole, managed a clear advantage around the turn, then drew
off in upper stretch, tired in the final furlong, but lasted from chasing rivals to the wire. CUSTOM SIERRA vied two wide early on, but failed to keep pace with
his inner counterpart at the half mile pole, chased that foe through the turn, then kept on late to narrow the gap as that rival weakened, but did not have
enough to catch him. K T'S JILTED GROOM stalked three wide, chased under urging around the turn, then stayed on outside of the leading pair late, but
failed to produce a bid. NOW NOW MAN broke a step slow, then saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. YOAKAM never got involved. ZION'S CALL
was off slowly and got outrun.

Footnotes
HAVE NO FEAR set the pace inside of a pair of pressing rivals, drew away from those foes entering the lane, and was driven home to seal the deal.
DOUBLE DARE YOU tracked along the inside, easily slipped inside of rivals approaching midstretch to gain place passing the furlong pole, and held that
position from an inner foe late. RANK AND FILE trailed along the inside around the turn, split foes two wide in upper stretch while commencing a gain,
attempted to split GET NONE and DOUBLE DARE YOU at the furlong grounds, but paused briefly when that hole closed leaving that marker, shifted inside
of those foes shortly after, but was fended off for place. WINNING QUALITY laid off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and stayed on
for a minor share without bidding. GET NONE pressed the pace three wide, but failed to keep pace with the eventual winner entering the lane, then
weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. GOTHAM CITY QUEEN prompted the pace two wide and between horses, sustained pressing position
while under strong urging around the bend, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
NOSY BANKER stalked two wide, bid for the lead in the three path entering the lane, forged an advantage from his inner counterpart at the furlong grounds,
then drew off at the sixteenth pole. PILLAGE DA VILLAGE set the pace along the inside, shifted to the two path entering the lane as NOSY BANKER bid,
but was headed by that foe at the furlong grounds, gave way thereafter while hanging on his left lead, but held place. CHAMBLISS laid off of the pace two
wide, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and stayed on to claim show a sixteenth from home. VON DOM stalked along the inside, but faltered and lost
position into the turn, chased from midpack around the bend, then shifted two wide in upper stretch, but failed to bid. BLAZING FIRE stalked along the
inside, but lacked a kick through a wide rail opening in upper stretch, and tired late. SEMI CHARMED LIFE chased the leading trio three wide around the
turn, then faded after being floated to the five path in upper stretch. MY LITTLE FLACO failed to factor. HARBOR KNIGHT never got involved. NOSY

Footnotes
JOY OF TREASURE rated off of the pace in the two path around the first turn, closed in to track the pace from the three to four path around the far turn, got
floated to the five path entering the lane, rallied through midstretch as an outer PAYTONSATTHEPLATE menaced along side, bid with that foe passing the
furlong pole, and edged away from that rival late. PAYTONSATTHEPLATE trailed, swung to the six path entering the lane, rallied outside of foes to bid
along with JOY OF TREASURE at the furlong grounds, but failed to keep pace with that foe late, and proved second best. TOURRISTA tracked along the
inside, tipped two wide down the backstretch before shifting three wide into the far turn, swept to the front at the five sixteenths pole while producing an early
bid, led through upper stretch while hanging on her left lead, but yielded to a pair of outer bidding foes approaching the final sixteenth. ZANDREA'S stalked
from the three to two path around the first turn, bid for the lead between horses around the far turn as TOURRISTA moved early, chased that foe while put
to a bit of tight quarters among those rivals in upper stretch, then failed to keep pace with outer foes through the final furlong. CARSON'S PRINCESS set
the pace while shifting down from the two path around the first turn, met a pair of bids around the far turn, got headed at the five sixteenths pole, but fought
back entering the lane, sustained vying position through upper stretch, but gave way at the furlong grounds. THE MISSING PIECE stalked along the inside,
shifted to the three path while inside of JOY OF TREASURE around the far turn, brushed his way to the four path passing the quarter pole for clear racing
room, but lacked a kick between horses in upper stretch, and faded.

Footnotes
TOOL BOX showed the way outside of a vying VOLITION early on, cleared that foe at the three furlong pole, stayed off of the rail around the turn before
being set down at the quarter pole, responded willingly, drew off in upper stretch, and was driven home to be kept to task. WAITIN' ON A WOMAN tracked
from midpack along the inside, shifted four wide approaching midstretch, rallied to bid for place along with an outer MY PAL GREELEY, then edged away
from that foe late to secure that position. MY PAL GREELEY broke inwardly to open space, laid off of the pace along the inside around the turn, gained
through upper stretch before awaiting racing room behind foes approaching midstretch, tipped five wide for clear sailing at the furlong pole, ranged up to
produce a bid for place outside of WAITIN' ON A WOMAN at the sixteenth pole, but failed to keep pace with that foe late. CONQUISTADOR GOLD tracked
from midpack two wide, got floated six wide while being outkicked by inner foe at the furlong grounds, drifted outwardly on his left lead shortly after, then
shifted back inwardly once corrected, and caught a tiring foe for a minor share. HOLDEN PASS stalked along the inside, gained place from an outer foe at
the three sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by a pair of foes at the sixteenth pole, then tired and was nailed on the wire for a minor placing. CIROC O
CLOCK bobbled at the start, laid at the rear along the inside into the turn, then passed tired foes through the lane. OLE STUD MUFFIN required a shoe
repair pre-race, then failed to factor. ARGYBARGY BUCK bobbled a bit at the start, then never got involved. JACKIE MOON chased two wide, but hung on
his left lead through the lane, and faded. VOLITION vied along the inside of the eventual winner, but failed to keep pace with that foe at the three furlong
pole, shifted to the four path shortly after to pursue that rival entering the lane, but weakened between horses at the furlong grounds, and stopped.

Footnotes
CHIMNEY ROCK stalked along the inside, took the turn in the two path before tipping outside of the dueling pair entering the lane, chased them through
upper stretch without firmly progressing, but rallied through the final furlong under a long drive, produced a late bid, and forged an advantage a few strides
from the wire. DENVER CITY set the pace inside of a vying JO DEE'S ANGEL, dueled with that foe through upper stretch, gamely repelled that foe at the
sixteenth pole, but was nailed late by an outer rallying rival. JO DEE'S ANGEL pressed the pace two wide early on, vied around the turn, dueled with his
inner counterpart through upper stretch, but was turned away approaching the final sixteenth, and yielded between horses late. JACK THE UMPIRE took a
bump from an outer foe in the opening furlong, saved ground off of the pace around the turn, then gained along the rail through midstretch, but chased the
leaders through the final sixteenth while lacking racing room. IRISH HOKIE came in and bumped an inner foe early on, settled at the rear two wide, shifted
to the four path in upper stretch, and stayed on belatedly, but failed to threaten. LEMON AND DIEM laid off of the pace three wide, drifted to the five path
entering the lane, then cut the gap on the leaders late without factoring. JACK THE RIPPER (FR) chased three wide, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
ISOLATE set the pace two wide early on, cleared into the turn, showed the way with VERB in pursuit, met that foe's bid entering the lane, but repelled that
foe in upper stretch, and drew off. VERB stalked three wide, tucked two wide into the turn, ranged up to a clear ISOLATE turning for home to bid entering
the lane, but was turned away in upper stretch, and chased that foe home well to prove second best. COLTONATOR bumped an inner foe soon after the
start, tracked from midpack two wide, gained three wide around the turn before tipping four wide entering the lane, then stayed on through the final furlong
to secure show. SHACKLEFORD STRONG was bumped by an inner foe at a start, then got jostled between horses soon after, saved ground off of the
pace, shifted two wide entering the lane split foes to gain a minor placing in upper stretch, and held that position. LAFITTE'S FLEET broke slowly but
avoided trouble by doing so, trailed the field around the turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, shifted five wide for clear sailng in upper stretch, and
moved up. AWE SHACKLE stalked two wide and between horses early on, but failed to keep pace with an outer foe into the turn, chased two wide around
the bend, shifted three wide entering the lane, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. ALTERNATE TIME came out multiple paths at the start,
bumped a rival into outer foes in the process, then vied along hte inside, chased outer foes into the turn, then faded through the lane. VICE VERSA was
pinched back soon after the start from tight quarters, laid off of the pace three wide, shifted five wide entering the lane, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
DREAMWORKER stalked while tucking down to the rail around the first turn, smoothly moved inside of the tiring leader around the far turn to bid at the five
sixteenths pole, led entering the lane dug in in upper stretch as ZISISIT (IRE) produced a bid, gamely shook free of that foe passing the furlong grounds,
and held sway safely thereafter. ZISISIT (IRE) stalked along the inside, but took up while failing to sustain that position around the first turn, tracked from
midpack down the backstretch, gained a pocket stalking position into the far turn, smoothly split the leaders entering the lane as SARATOGA PASODOBLE
created an opening while floating outer rivals wide, bid outside of DREAMWORKER in upper stretch, but was turned away passing the furlong pole, yielded,
but just saved place on the wire. HONEY RUN lunged outwardly at the start and bumped a foe, settled off of the pace three wide, shifted four wide into the
backstretch, gained around the far turn before being floated five wide entering the lane, then produced a late kick in the final furlong, but just missed
reaching place. SHISHITO (IRE) stalked two wide, ranged up three wide around the far turn, but was floated four wide entering the lane while failing to keep
pace with an inner bidding foe, then chased that rival home evenly, but was outkicked for show late. SWIZZLECITY tracked three to two wide around the
turns, shifted three wide in upper stretch, but only managed to chase before fading. MY SWEETNESS took bumps from rivals on either side at the start, laid
off of the pace in the two path, took the far turn in the four path before swinging six wide entering the lane, but failed to menace. SURREY bumped an inner
foe at the start, trailed the field in the four path around the first turn, saved ground at the rear around the far turn, and never got involved. SARATOGA
PASODOBLE shifted outwardly while showing the way through the homestretch, but keenly ran off to a clear margin around the first turn, stayed off of the
rail, then met a pair of bids by rivals on either side while weakening around the far turn, drifted outwardly entering the lane, floated foes wider in the process,
and caved.

Footnotes
DICTATOR set a clear pace in the two path while loping along with a low head carriage around the first turn, managed a clear margin through the far turn,
held sway from an inner chasing foe through midstretch, and edged away late. TRIVISTA tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, but gained
ground down the backstretch to an inside stalking position into the far turn, stalked the clear leader around that bend, then chased while aiming inside of that
rival through the lane, but failed to bid before tiring late, then just saved place. CALL THE COLONEL stalked two wide, chased the clear leader from the
three path around the far turn, then stayed on through the late stages, but just missed reaching a tiring foe for place. WOMAN WITH A BOOK settled far off
of the pace along the inside, rallied three wide around the far turn before swinging to the five path entering the lane, ranged up outside of CALL THE
COLONEL in midstretch to bid for show, but stalled and hung for that position. BETTER WATCH OUT tracked along the inside, then two wide around the far
turn, and moved up through the lane without threatening. LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS was crowded in tight quarters at the start, laid off of the pace three
wide, gained to an inside tracking position into the far turn, but only managed to chase through the lane without bidding. DEANO stalked along the inside,
but faltered and lost multiple lengths of position into the far turn, and kept on through the lane. MR. SHORTANDSIMPLE was put to tight quarters between
horses at the start, then failed to factor. PROMISING SHOES got outrun. CITALI stalked three wide, chased while fading in the four path around the far turn,
and weakened entering the lane. GOOD INTENT tracked from midpack four wide, but weakened around the far turn.
