Footnotes
OUTSHINE was forwardly placed around the first turn, stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, vied with GRACEFUL KITTEN past the quarter pole,
gained a slim lead past the furlong marker, dug in gamely under pressure and held firm over the runner up. PARLOR came away last and was a bit tight two
wide into the first turn, rated in range three wide up the backstretch, moved up closer late on the far turn, came five wide into the lane, advanced to duel at
the furlong marker, continued in striking distance of the winner but could not get by. TIL THE END settled off the pace through early stages, hustled up
midway around the far turn, sustained a steady bid through the stretch run and cleared a share. GRACEFUL KITTEN cleared and crossed over soon after
the start, set the pace up the backstretch, vied for the lead with the eventual winner past the quarter pole, fought back to mid-stretch then gave way.
GOLDEN DECISION settled through early stages, dropped to the rail late on the far turn, roused forward on the rail in the upper stretch then steadied in the
final furlong and flattened out. PHILO rated inside up the backstretch, urged two wide through the far turn and failed to respond. SPINNING KITTEN tracked
inside through the backstretch, began to weaken around the far turn and continued to tired in the lane.

Footnotes
TONE FEELIN vied early inside NEW YORK STYLE, got the best of that dispute coming off the turn, then gamely repelled challenges from SIR KAHN and
FLIPPING FISH through a long drive. SIR KAHN advanced midway on the turn, loomed between horses three to four wide after six furlongs, and ran on
willingly outside the winner. FLIPPING FISH was a step slower than the rest at the start, ranged up four to five wide outside the leaders past the
quarter-pole, had aim through the lane and finished evenly while clear of the rest. WICKED TEMPTATIONS stayed in striking range for six furlongs, and
lacked the needed response. NEW YORK STYLE alternated for the lead outside TONE FEELIN to the top of the stretch, and weakened. BRETT'S WORLD
faded steadily after a half-mile outside.

Footnotes
STUCK ON KITTEN tracked the pace two wide, took over turning for home and drew off under a drive. FUNNY ENOUGH stalked the pace three wide, was
unable to match strides with the winner in upper stretch and stayed on well enough to hold clear of the rest. GATHER AS YOU GO broke inwardly and
bumped PRUDENT SONG at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled four wide nearing the lane and was along for the show. BREEHAZEL vied two
wide, drew clear midway around the turn, was collared turning for home and tired in the lane. GREAT WARRIOR (IRE) led early and retreated inside.
PRUDENT SONG was bumped at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. ALKI PUY was rank early, dropped well back and trailed inside.

MEGAYACHT stalked the pacesetter through early stages, vied outside of NORTH CAROLINA around the final turn, took over the lead turning for home,
angled inside, widened advantage under left handed pressure and remained clear. PLEASE THE PHAROAH was allowed to settle off the pace through
early stages, picked up the pace two to three wide around the final turn, sustained a steady three wide bid through the lane and cleared second best.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT sat outside a rival and stalked the early pace, ridden along the rail through the final turn, remained inside into the lane and
stayed on for a share. NORTH CAROLINA sped to the lead and set the early pace while saving ground, vied for the lead with the winner around the final
turn, got overhauled turning for home and steadily weakened. WARN rated inside near midpack, was ridden along entering the final turn, had no response
and gave way. DADDY FRANK (GB) raced in the back, saved ground and never menaced. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE

FRENCHMEN STREET advanced to contention swinging out five wide approaching the stretch, rallied steadily outside rivals and was up late in a frantic
finish. CITY DRIFTER was never far back, bid between horses through the stretch and just missed. TROPICAT bumped with GRAINGER COUNTY at the
start, came four wide off the turn, and finished willingly between horses to share the show. THE CONNECTOR chased outside HARRY'S ONTHELOOSE to
the stretch, and ran on gamely in the two-path between foes. GRAINGER COUNTY bumped with TROPICAT at the start, trailed for three furlongs, fanned
widest for the drive and was gaining too late. HARRY'S ONTHELOOSE set the pace inside to deep stretch, and could not hold off the cavalry. BELGRANO
lacked room along the inside through the turn, and lacked a solid response in the stretch.

BUFFALO MAX trailed inside for a half, went four wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, closed widest while trying to lug in and was
up in deep stretch. EASY STRIDE settled off the early pace inside, advanced three wide around the far turn, bid between foes nearing the eighth pole,
battled inside of the winner from there but was narrowly outfinished. PAPA HONOR stalked the pace two wide, took over in upper stretch, led to deep
stretch and was outkicked late. ON THE COUCH chased the pace two and three wide and lacked the needed rally. CHURCHILLS VICTORY set the pace
off the rail, was collared in upper stretch and weakened through the lane. FINDING MISCHIEF had his head turned at the start, raced off the pace three
wide, steadied nearing the three-eighths pole, went two wide around the far turn and never threatened. RESIDENT LIBERAL was outrun inside. GRRR
raced off the early pace three wide, advanced outside down the backstretch, was pulled up midway around the far turn and was vanned off.

Footnotes
ONLY KIDDING tracked the top two leaders through the early going, moved up three wide to engage the top pair near the quarter pole, vied outside of
MINE FOR PASSION turning for home, gained the advantage in the final furlong and finished clear. MINE FOR PASSION forced the early pace in the two
path, moved up to race on equal terms near the quarter pole, vied inside of ONLY KIDDING into the stretch run, could not move on with the winner past
mid-stretch and settled for second best. CONFIDENCEINTERVAL lacked speed and raced in the back, saved ground into the lane, tipped out a path wider
in the upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and secured show. BYRDIE HOWE raced off the early speed, hustled along through the turn, came three to four
wide into the lane and failed to kick on. HIGH FAIR weakened after the start and shifted inside to save ground, hustled up two wide around the turn and had
no response. HONOR THAT held a slight edge while dueling for the lead with ONLY KIDDING, could not keep pace leaving the turn and steadily faded.

Footnotes
LEVIOSA broke to the lead, showed the way in the two-path to the stretch, was under pressure from both flanks through the late stages and held firm.
BLAME IT ON ROSE pressed LEVIOSA from the start, had aim outside through a long drive, and could not get by. DIGNIFIED ran along hemmed in behind
the leaders on the turn, remained bottled up once straightened away for the drive, had no option other than to attempt a rail rally, and steadied in tight
quarters a sixteenth out. ELISA'S SONG bobbled at the start, saved ground outsprinted to the stretch, and posed no threat. MADAME CLAUDE gave chase
between horses three wide into the turn, and lacked a rally. TWENTY ONE SHORT raced four wide and faded steadily before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
TIK TOK FAMOUS (GB) was bumped at the start, settled two wide between foes in midpack, tipped three wide near the quarter pole, moved to the front
near the sixteenth pole and held firm between myriad foes in the final yards. CAROLINE'S STORY tracked the pace from the rail, tipped two wide in upper
stretch, angled four wide to get clear run near the eighth pole, rallied between foes and won the bob for the place. APPLECROSS (IRE) lacked early speed
while racing two wide, steadied near the quarter pole, swung out in upper stretch, closed strongly down the center of the track and just missed second.
ISADORABLE AIDA saved ground in midpack, angled four wide leaving the quarter pole, rallied between rivals and was outkicked. TUSCAN QUEEN set
the pace along the rail, ceded the lead midway around the far turn but fought on inside of foes to the wire. CENTSLESS DRAMA bumped with TIK TOK
FAMOUS at the start, pressed the pace two wide, took the lead around the far turn, led past the eighth pole and weakened a bit late. MAGNA MATER (IRE)
hit the starting gate, raced two wide around both turns and never threatened. STARSHIP MALLOMAR was outrun inside. CULTURED chased the pace
three and four wide and came up empty in the lane. TWILIGHT played no factor while racing three and four wide. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

clear path at the quarter pole, got through two wide turning for home, raced in striking distance of the eventual winner but could not get by. QUEEN MACHA
was unhurried and raced in the back, picked up the pace late on the far turn, swung wide into the lane, rallied along the outside and gained a share.
SPREAD JOY was unhurried, hustled up two wide between foes through the final turn, shifted out wider in the final furlong and got edged out for show.
INES'S HATS stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, advanced to gain a slim lead at the quarter pole, vied for the lead with the winner in the upper
stretch and gave way. NOVEL IDEA rated near midpack, was ridden along four wide late on the far turn, fanned out wider into the lane and failed to kick on.
AMBAR settled and saved ground, tipped two wide for the drive and lacked a needed rally. CREME CARAMEL saved ground through the first turn, shifted
out and raced off the early pace, came under a ride around the far turn and failed to move on. UP IN THE AIR raced in range up the backstretch, continued
in contention three wide past the quarter pole then faded turning for home. CRACKLE CANDY set the pace up the backstretch, got collared near the quarter
pole and steadily weakened.
