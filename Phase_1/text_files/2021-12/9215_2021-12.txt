Footnotes
UNBRIDLED'S SKYE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a quarter to run and drew off as a
handy winner. SHARK HARBOR settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to
gain the place. CLUB CHAMP was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with a
late bid. COLAVITO raced off the pacesetters early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and lacked the needed closing response.
RED MAMBA disputed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half. ACTIVE PASS veered in at the start, was checked, lagged early,
saved ground through the turn and did not menace. WE MISS GENO disputed the pace while racing three-wide for a half and weakened.

Footnotes
MINEHUNTER sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace and held sway to the wire. INDIAN GAMBLER was bumped at the
start, raced just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out into the lane and finished with a steady rally. LITIGATOR chased the
winner while racing four-wide and failed to gain in the drive. ROUGE SUNSET was bumped at the start, settled off the leaders from the inside and finished
evenly in the drive. LT. BULLITT lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. VAPORIZED was bumped at the start, showed
no early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and did not threaten. CALIFORNIA TENGA was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through
the turn and did not threaten. TOM FOOLERY chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after the opening quarter.

unhurried early, saved ground through the turn and finished with some late run. WITHIN AUTISM settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the
turn and finished evenly late. FACE OF GRACE raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. SEENEVA THE CAT
raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and did not threaten. NIGHT MIST was void of early foot, raced three-wide through the turn
and was not a factor. SCAM LIKELY showed brief speed, raced four-wide through the turn and weakened. PHANTOM MISTRESS lacked early foot, raced
three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. TAZEETI lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not menace. MUCH ABOUT ONE

Footnotes
ROCK THE BELLES was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, responded to steady urging and was up in the closing yards.
ROYAL O'HAIGAIN was never far back, saved ground through the turn, reached the fore and opened a commanding lead into the stretch but could not
resist her stable-mate late. MISS MALIA lagged early, saved ground through the turn and finished with some late run. MS PARKSIDE was void of early
speed, raced five-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished evenly late. ONEFINEDAY sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide
while setting the pace and weakened after going a half. WE ALL AGREE pressed the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
PEPPER SPRAY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached the fore in tandem with BANGO FOR BUCKS nearing
the half, vied with that rival and proved best in a stiff drive. BANGO FOR BUCKS pressed the pace from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the half,
vied with the winner and just missed. TWO GUNS lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with a late bid. HEY NOW settled off the
leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached a contending position and failed to gain late. ABRAAJ MIRAGE set a pressured pace while racing
four-wide and weakened after going a quarter. CHROME KING pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after the opening quarter.
PROFOUND ONE veered in gap soon after the start and unseated the rider.
