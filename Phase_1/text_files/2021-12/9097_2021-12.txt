Footnotes
SUGAR STREAK raced three wide off the pace, rallied outside nearing the quarter pole, took over and pulled away under urging. PECAN PATTIE raced off
the pace between rivals, advanced on the turn, came wide and rallied outside for second. HAY BUCK steadied in tight entering the first turn, stalked two
wide, moved up between rivals on the far turn, rallied and was outkicked for second. SUBSIDIARY set the pace racing in the two path, dueled past the
quarter pole and weakened in the final furlong. TOMARIE raced off the pace, came wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. SPECIAL RISK tracked close up
on the inside, made a mild rail bid nearing the far turn, then chased and tired. GRACE'S DRAMA was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside and failed to
threaten. ANGEL RAPHAEL bobbled at the break, raced off the rail and was outrun.

Footnotes
MY AMANJENA broke a step slowly, settled behind the leaders, swung wide rallying on the final turn and drew away through the final furlong. MR THRIFTY
rated three wide just off the leaders, was challenged by the winner and continued willingly. HOLIDAY BONUS moved just off the pace inside then flattened
out in the stretch. MISSION OBERON set a pressured pace inside to the stretch and weakened. BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL dropped back outside and lacked a
response. LUCKY HERO prompted the pace for three quarters then gave way. EXCALIBUR lagged far behind throughout.

THE RIGHT PATH raced off the pace between horses, moved up midway on the turn, angled out in upper stretch, rallied outside, surged in deep stretch
and was up late for the win. GOLDEN SPOKE stalked outside, bid two wide on the turn, took over, kicked clear, dug in gamely, was caught in deep stretch
and then held on for the place spot. DON'T RECALL raced three wide off the pace, advanced on the turn, came wide into the stretch and closed well late
outside. R GOODTIME CHARLIE was bumped at the start, stalked the pacesetter, then chased and weakened. DEFIBRILLATOR was bumped at the start,
raced off the pace inside, angled out in upper stretch and closed belatedly outside. LAZARETTO raced three wide off the pace and had no rally. RUN FAST
broke out bumping rivals at the start, then chased and tired. CATCH MY VIBE raced between foes and failed to threaten. SINASHACK stumbled at the start,
set the pace on the inside, dueled briefly on the turn, chased and gave way.

EARLY EDITION vied briefly, took over into the far turn then pulled away impressively under a couple cracks of the whip and a brisk hand ride. LA LA LUCY
chased between rivals down the backstretch, faded on the turn then came again for the place. EMMA'S TOUCH forced the pace inside then began fading
on the turn. CREATIVE JOY saved ground within range then faltered. SHEZ A DOUBLETAKE raced wide off the pace, made a brief bid on the turn then
proved empty. A LOOKER lagged far behind then closed the gap while no factor. SHE'SFIRSTCLASS chased wide throughout and faded.

SEVIER set the pace on the inside, rated kindly, responded when roused at the quarter pole, dug in gamely inside of KINGSVILLE in the final furlong and
held on gamely for the win. KINGSVILLE pressed the pace from the outset, bid on the far turn, rallied outside entering the stretch, dug in gamely through the
stretch run but second best. THEY SHOT SONNY stalked the leaders, chased on the far turn, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly.
JAMMINWITHBRANDON raced off the rail, off the pace, chased on the far turn and lacked a rally. BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE raced off the pace inside and
failed to threaten. MANOLETE raced two wide off the pace, went three wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. RELISHMENT raced off the pace inside
and did not factor.

WITTY steadied in tight early, rushed inside to contention, angled out on the turn and eagerly drew away under moderate urging. UNCLE BUDDY close up
early outside, bid inside on the turn and closed well while no threat to the winner. VINE JET far behind early, swung wide at the quarter pole and offered a
late bid. DANCE CODE eased back in the opening quarter, moved extremely wide on the turn and rallied. DISCO EBO settled just off the leaders outside
and proved empty in the stretch. WISPERING SPRINGS sprinted clear along the inside, was collared near the quarter pole and faded. ALLEVARE chased
very wide down the backstretch and failed to respond. CENTER MID MADDIE chased between rivals early then gave way. DR. STEVE prompted the pace
then gave way. CHAMPION BY DESIGN stopped abruptly on the turn, bled from the nostrils and was eased.
