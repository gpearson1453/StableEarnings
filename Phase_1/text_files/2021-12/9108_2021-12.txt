Footnotes
MURRICANE well back early, advanced wide on the final turn and was up in the late yards. ENANO trailed early, advanced inside with a steady late gain.
WILL TAKE CONTROL moved closer on the final turn then proved empty in the stretch. FOX IN THE FOG dropped far behind then advanced inside through
the stretch. ITS ABOUT MY TIME set the pace, inherited a long lead on the final turn after the runner-up at that point was eased but weakened. ABOUT
THE MULTIPLE was taken up sharply to avoid the stricken rival near the three eighths pole losing any chance. BIG DADDY BUZZ prompted the pace
outside, suffered a catastrophic injury near the 3/8 pole and was subsequently euthanized. JOVIAL was a late scratch at the gate on the advice of the track
veterinarian.

Footnotes
YOUR PAL vied between rivals for the lead, dueled on the turn, battled it out with MIDNIGHT MIRACLE in the final furlong and prevailed determinedly inside
of that rival. MIDNIGHT MIRACLE vied three wide for the early lead, dueled three wide on the turn, dug in gamely outside of the winner through the stretch
run and could not get by. KNOCK OUT KID raced off the pace, advanced between rivals on the turn and rallied mildly. ATLANTIC AVENUE vied four wide
early, chased on the turn, came four wide into the lane and weakened. ROCHELA tracked on the inside and tired. TRUE UPGRADE was outrun early and
did not factor. LUNA AZTECA raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. CHECOTAH vied inside for the lead, dueled on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
ALEJANDRO'S TEAM rated inside, advanced on the final turn, swung wide in the stretch with a late surge and moved clear. OFF THE MEDS reserved
outside, faded briefly, angled inside rallying in the stretch too late. AMERICAN ROMA forced the pace outside, moved clear in the stretch then weakened.
SUPERHIGHWAY lacked speed, saved ground and finished willingly. DUBROVSKY fanned wide on the first turn, remained wide and flattened out.
LUXURY SUITE trailed early, raced wide then passed fading rivals. DIAMOND SETTER chased outside, was put to the whip after half a mile but lacked a
rally. YONDERING dropped back early and was never in contention. RINGS OF JUPITER set a pressured pace inside to midway on the final turn and
faltered. SIGHT LINE saved ground just off the leaders and stopped.
