Footnotes
EARLY VOTING disputed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, moved clear inside the five-sixteenths, responded well when asked for
his best in upper stretch and held under steady urging. MATT DOYLE was well placed down the backstretch, went two then three wide under urging on the
turn, drifted inward in upper stretch, chased the winner while remaining on his inside to the wire and finished willingly for the place. ICONIC ADVENTURE
broke out at the start, settled on the outside, moved from three to five wide under urging on the turn, remained on his inside lead to just before the
sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. MAIN EVENT bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along at the rear of the field,
moved from the rail to the two path early on the turn and was no factor. SUL PHAROAH bumped with a foe at the start then was hustled, contested the
pace, vied inside on the turn, lost touch with the winner outside the quarter-pole and tired. SMART STORM settled off the pace, was urged three wide on the
turn and failed to respond. MY BROTHER CAM was hustled from the gate, contested the pace between horses, dropped back late on the backstretch and
stopped then was eased in the stretch but walked off after passing the wire.

Footnotes
GREAT WORKOUT broke a step slow, was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, pursued the leader
on the outside, gained to make a bid into the final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. GOOD CULTURE was urged along off the pace,
chased while dropping from the two path to the rail on the turn, pursued the leader into the final furlong, gained to make a bid into the final sixteenth but just
missed while clear for the place. FOREST SPIRIT set a clear early pace, lost the lead in the two to three path on the turn, regained the advantage in upper
stretch, led under a drive to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken but held the show. MISTER WINSTON tracked the pace on the outside, gained under
urging at the seven-sixteenths, took the lead in the three to four path on the turn, lost the advantage in upper stretch, battled under a drive into the final
furlong and weakened. MAKE IT IN NY was bumped hard in the hindquarters at the start and off a step slow, settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn
and was no factor. FULL MOON FEVER was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, went three to four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. BAR
FOURTEEN stumbled badly at the start and unseated the rider then was caught by the outrider after completing the journey and walked off. RACE WAS
HAND-TIMED DUE TO THE LOOSE HORSE TRIPPING THE BEAMS EARLY

Footnotes
HAPPY MEDIUM was hustled to the front, extended the advantage in the two path on the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, drew off
under a hand-ride while being flagged with the whip until outside the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best. WUDDA U THINK NOW
chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. CHESTERTOWN was taken up
between foes just after the start, raced on the outside under urging, went three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response while best of the rest. T LOVES A FIGHT settled in the middle of the field, saved ground on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. MR PHIL was coaxed along on the outside, went two then three wide on the turn, moved to four then five wide outside the quarter-pole and came
up empty. TROUBLING MOON broke a step slow, dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn and never reached contention. ARCH
CAT settled under some urging, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor. FOOLISH GHOST was reluctant to load, chased the pace on the
inside of a rival, dropped in leaving the backstretch, fell back while inside early on the turn, drifted three wide late on that bend and faltered.

at the furlong marker, shook clear into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. REGGAE MUSIC MAN was urged along off the pace,
went three wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and improved position to just get the show. TAPIZEARANCE pressed the pace on the outside of
