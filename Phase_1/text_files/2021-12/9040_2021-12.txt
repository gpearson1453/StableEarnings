Footnotes
KNIGHTS SWORD sprinted to the front, saved ground, pulled away and proved much the best. ORDER UP ANOTHER pressed the pace, saved ground
around the turn, angled out down the lane and got up for second. BLUE RIDGE ROMANCE was an early factor, forwardly placed throughout and got caught
late for second. BOSTON BELLE raced within contention, put forth an even effort and lacked a bid. RAVENS BLING raced within striking distance, faded
and was no threat late. ABIGAILS TAKEOVER always raced near the back and showed little. ANNA CLAUSE stumbled at the start and lost rider, walked
off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS CALLED INTO THE START OF THE RACE. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

UNBELIEVABLE CATCH challenged for the lead throughout, dueled to the wire and prevailed for the win. ONE PROUD BOY brushed start, vied for the
early advantage, saved ground, dueled to the wire, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. DAVES FRIEND DEWEY brushed at the start,
raced within contention in the beginning, came around the final turn three wide and proved no match for the top two. UNBRIDLED PULPIT lacked early
speed and trailed throughout.

forwardly placed throughout, couldn't catch the leader, but was best of others. US SECOND CUTE PIE broke out, bumped rival, racing near the back in the
beginning, made a steady gain and got up for show. MEAN AMERICAN bothered at the break, raced near the back, came around the first turn wide, moved
up within contention and lacked a late kick. STAR FASHION void of early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. CRIDER CHASE raced near the
middle of the field, came around the final turn wide and lacked a rally. STORMY SUNRISE void of early speed and showed little. RACELYNN pressed the
early pace, saved ground around the final turn and retreated. STREAMER hopped at the break, racing near the back and was never close. WHO DAT

Footnotes
BAJAN CASH lacked early speed, had a wide trip, rallied down the home stretch and drove clear. HONORING MAJOR lacked early speed, made a steady
gain, came around the final turn wide, rallied and was a clear second. POST CLOSE challenged for the early lead, took the advantage around the final turn,
but proved no match for the top two late. GREELEY'S DEALER pressed the pace, weakened and finished evenly. LATE NITE MISCHIEF raced within
contention, came around the first turn wide, made a bid and faded. DREAM HALO raced in the middle of the field, came around the final turn wide and was
no factor. ZITMAN was shut off at the start, racing in the rear and never recovered. HIGH POWERED broke out at the break, raced evenly near the back
and showed little. GUITARZAN sprinted to the front, saved ground and was finished early. MOMENT challenged on the front end and dropped back.

Footnotes
HONORARIAN showed early speed, racing behind the leader in the early part, took the advantage entering the final turn, pulled away and won under steady
urging. FLASH ME BACK pressed the pace, had an outside trip, proved no match for the winner, but held on for second. CONATIVE raced within striking
distance, made a late bid and was outfinished for second. QUANA DUDE lacked early speed, made a mild bid, but was no factor. DREAMONMEBABY
raced near the back, improved position, but was no factor. READY REDDING raced in the middle of the field, came around the final turn wide, weakened
and was no threat late. CALLTHEWOLFE always raced near the back and was outrun. CAJUNS GOLDEN POND went to the front, drove clear, saved
ground and stopped.
