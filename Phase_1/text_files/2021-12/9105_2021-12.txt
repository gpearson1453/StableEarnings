Footnotes
IN JUBALATION settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and closed to the lead four wide midway
on the far turn, drew clear and angled to the rail at the eighth pole and was steadily encouraged through the lane. JACKSON MAN stalked four wide the first
turn then challenged at the seven sixteenths pole, dueled at even terms between horses three wide on the far turn, exchanged light contact with QUID PRO
QUO at the eighth pole, dropped back at that point and settled for second. The latter ran loose in the post parade then stalked three wide on the first turn,
took a slim lead into the backstretch and dueled at mostly even terms from that point, raced at a close disadvantage between horses through the far turn,
exchanged light contact with Jackson Man at the eighth pole then flattened the final furlong. GOLDEN METTLE saved early ground then bid leaving the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, angled to the four path into the stretch and finished evenly. MY BOY STRYKER bobbled after the start
then saved early ground, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little further. DOC ELM rated
the early pace inside, was met into the backstretch and dueled at the rail from that point, contested at a close disadvantage through the far turn but steadied
toward the head of the lane and weakened. ON A WHIM saved ground, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, though, faded into the far
turn. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of In Jubalation, lodged by the rider of Jackson Man, and also reviewed a claim of foul against
the rider of Jackson Man, lodged by the rider of Quid Pro Quo, though found no cause for change.

Footnotes
POWER FORWARD saved ground off the pace, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and steadily progressed in the three path of the far turn, dug in
leaving the turn and dueled for the nod through later yards. MOMA TIGER saved ground on the opening turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths
pole and took the lead at the quarter, drew clear midway on the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane but ceded the nod through later yards. SLINGIN
SAMMY B stalked off the rail the first turn, started a three wide bid nearing the three eighths pole and had a slim brief lead at the five sixteenths, but was
caught at the quarter pole, dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened stride. DECO STRONG rounded the first turn about the four path,
bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole then flattened in the four path of the far turn. DAZZLE ME raced well back saving ground and could only improve her
position. BOOGIE WITH ME raced with the early pace two deep, took the lead at the nine sixteenths pole but was caught at the five sixteenths and
weakened at the rail on the far turn. COMPLETE SURPRISE contested the early pace inside, gave chase into the backstretch then weakened approaching
the far turn. The 3/4 fraction was hand timed.

Footnotes
MUTAKAAMIL rounded the opening turn about the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, took the
lead in the three path approaching the top of the stretch, dueled clear mid-stretch then widened later yards. GRECIAN ADMIRAL raced in the five path the
first turn then stalked into the backstretch, dueled leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the nod two deep approaching the quarter, was caught toward
the head of the lane, dropped back mid-stretch and had to settle for second. ROOF TOP BAR settled back in the two and three paths the first turn, bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, was eased to the outside into the stretch and came along for third late.
BUZZHOUND took over nearing the three quarter pole and rated the pace inside, was caught toward the seven sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point
and rounded the far turn at the rail, angled out toward the head of the lane and ran evenly in the stretch. JEFFERY SCOTT stalked off the rail the first turn
then took a slim lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole, dueled from the three eighths but was caught at the rail approaching the quarter, dropped back
midway on the far turn and weakened. NAUTICAL WARRIOR steadied in the four path through the first turn and showed little response leaving the half mile
pole. HENRY STANDINGBEAR settled back off the rail on the first turn and never factored.

Footnotes
OHIO CLASS stalked two deep the first turn, took the lead between horses approaching the seven sixteenths pole, came under pressure past the five
sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn and dug in under steady encouragement to hold on well. ANOTHER VICTORY settled back in the three path the
first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced two deep on the far turn, drew close at the rail inside the sixteenth pole but flattened nearing the
wire. HOBE SOUND saved ground on the opening turn then eased outward into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn in the four path, finished well to take third later yards and was gaining on the top two. BROTHER CORBIN stalked from the three path, challenged
toward the five sixteenths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, then flattened stride leaving the eighth pole. TRINGALE rounded the first turn
about the four path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, checked in tight toward the eighth pole then flattened.
FORTUNE'S FOOL rated a short lead inside, was caught toward the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, but weakened at the rail on the
far turn. FU MAN SUE mostly saved ground.

Footnotes
DUNLUCE CAISSLE was shut off leaving the gate and dropped well back off the rail the first turn, eased outward into the backstretch, bid nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and dug in from the head of the lane to take over the final yards. HEROIC DEED was bumped at the
break, rounded the opening turn in the seven path and raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead in the three path
midway on the far turn, drew clear into the lane but was caught late. FREE STEVE stalked two deep then challenged toward the three eighths pole and took
a slim lead past the pole, came in to make contact with Chappie James approaching the quarter pole, raced briefly clear but was caught midway on the far
turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. NEW SOUTH settled off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and ran evenly through the lane. INDY DEL SOL saved early ground then bid nearing the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn about the six path, left the turn outside and passed rivals. OULOG raced well off the pace and off the rail the first turn, bid leaving
the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little further. CHAPPIE JAMES contested the pace through the front stretch then
rated the pace into the first turn, came under pressure past the seven sixteenths pole, was caught leaving the three eighths and gave chase from that point,
but was bumped by Free Steve and steadied at the rail nearing the quarter pole, then faded through the far turn. NOW I'M BROKE rounded the opening turn
off the rail then stalked into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though, faded off the rail on the far turn. SAVE THE LAND broke
outward across the path of Dunluce Caissle and made contact with Heroic Deed, rounded the first turn about the six path, was taken to the outside past the
seven sixteenths pole and not asked for more. BERRINCHE saved ground on the first turn, showed no response through the backstretch and was eased
past the five sixteenths pole.
