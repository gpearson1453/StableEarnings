Footnotes
BOSS CARA bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, traveled around most of the turn in the two path, shifted three wide while asked outside
the quarter-pole, gained five wide into upper stretch, took the lead near the three-sixteenths while still on her inside lead, swapped to the proper lead while
disposing of runner-up at the sixteenth-pole and moved clear under steady urging. WICKED HAPPY bumped with a foe near the five-eighths, tracked the
pace on the outside, ranged up three wide on the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, took the lead at the quarter-pole, lost the lead to the winner while
asked in upper stretch, fought with that foe into the final furlong and was outfinished while well clear for the place. MADAME ROSE was hustled from the
start, disputed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and
weakened but held the show. ALITA broke in and bumped with a foe, was urged along off the pace, went three wide for most of the turn under strong
encouragement, moved to four wide outside the quarter-pole then came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. MY DELICIOUS
disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.
ANCHOR LADY raced between horses early, bumped with a rival around the five-eighths then dropped back, started the turn in the two path, dropped to the
rail around the three-eighths, came out into the stretch and was no factor. SWEET MARY LOU was last to commence, raced at the rear, suffered an injury
near the seven-sixteenths and was pulled up then vanned off.

Footnotes
ARISTOCRATIC became fractious in the gate when a foe to the outside was restless, broke very fast then showed the way down the backstretch, controlled
the action while inside around the turn, responded well when set down into upper stretch then was put to a right-handed crop at the three-sixteenths,
switched to a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker, was challenged by the runner-up coming to the sixteenth-pole, fought gamely with that foe to the
wire and determinedly prevailed. BABY I'M PERFECT brushed with a foe at the start, pressed then chased the pace on the outside, went around the turn in
the two path, pursued the winner under the crop into the final furlong, gained to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, battled on even terms with the winner
to the wire and was denied while clear for the place. FAST BREAK broke out a bit then brushed with a rival, was coaxed along just off the pace on the
outside, came under stronger encouragement in the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch under a left-handed crop and lacked the needed
kick while able to secure the show. REJECTED AGAIN brushed with an opponent at the start, settled well back on the outside, went four wide under some
urging on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. MI TRES POR CIENTO (CHI) brushed with a foe at the start then bobbled and dropped
back some, was urged along off the pace, rounded the turn in the three path, was driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
WINNING DRIVE settled at the rear, went around the turn in the two path, swung six wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and failed
to threaten. BOURBON MISSION was restless in the gate, brushed with rivals at the start then was hustled, established a good position just off the pace,
dropped back along the rail on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
SUMMARY JUDGMENT leaned out against the gate at the start then bobbled slightly, moved in while going to the front, vied inside on the turn, responded
well when asked coming to the quarter-pole then extended the advantage into upper stretch, was put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker,
drew off under the crop to the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand-ride to the wire while much the best. INCONTROVERTIBLE veered out at the
start and bumped with a foe, stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was given her cue near the five-sixteenths, chased the
winner into the stretch and proved no match while well clear for the place. SIMPLE SUGAR settled off the pace, was hard ridden in the two path on the turn,
brushed with a foe while three wide into the stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker and secured the show. ELEGANT LAOBAN moved out early then
came under urging, dropped well behind the rest of the field, moved from the two path to the rail midway through the turn and was no factor. STRONG
POINT was forced out at the start and last to commence, settled outside under some urging, went three then two wide on the turn, steadied briefly between
horses at the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. AFTER THE WIRE settled off the pace, was urged three wide on the
turn, brushed with a foe while four wide into the stretch, was carried out significantly near the furlong marker and came up empty. SYNONYMOUS moved
out while urged along, advanced closer with six furlongs to run, went four wide on the turn, dropped back six wide into the stretch then moved in and had
nothing left. FAVORITE IMPULSE leaned in and brushed the gate at the start, had the rider lose his right iron coming to the eleven-sixteenths, regained the
iron at the five-eighths pole, moved up under urging, dropped back while moving from inside to the three path on the turn and faltered then was eased but
walked off.

Footnotes
THERISASTORMBREWIN showed speed on the inside of a trio of horses, took the lead outside the five-eighths, vied in the two path on the turn, responded
well when asked for his best in upper stretch and held under strong urging. IT'S MANDATORY dropped back at the start, was urged along towards the rear,
went four wide on the turn, gained quickly coming to the quarter-pole, drifted out in pursuit of the winner near the furlong marker and finished willingly for the
place. MANDATORY PAYOUT dropped back at the start, settled outside under some urging, moved in to save ground early on the turn, shifted three wide
later on that bend, came five wide into the stretch and was along for the show. OBSESSED came in at the start and was off a couple lengths slow, settled at
the rear, went four wide under urging on the turn, drifted in outside the furlong marker and was no factor. SPECTATORLESS showed speed between
horses early, lost the lead outside the five-eighths then pressed the pace, vied in the three path on the turn and tired. RESPECT FOR ALL showed speed
between horses then chased the pace, dropped back in the three path on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and capitulated. MR. BRIGGS was off slow
and spotted the front a few lengths, moved up into the middle of the field, saved ground under urging on the turn and failed to respond. A COLT NAMED
SUSIE was hustled from the start, showed outside speed then dropped back, moved in late on the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and faltered.

stretch, pursued the leader into the final furlong while still on his inside lead, switched to the proper lead while making a bid outside the sixteenth-pole then
took the advantage and edged clear under strong handling. BROCKMONINOFF showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside, inched
away along the rail on the turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole then turned into the stretch in the two path, led under a drive to near the
sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while just able to get the place. HANGAR ONE was urged along early then taken in hand near the nine-sixteenths,

chased into the final furlong, moved out approaching the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly for the show. RUN CASPER RUN was urged along on the
outside, went five then six wide on the turn and lacked the needed kick. COACH BAHE was void of speed, dropped well behind under urging, saved ground
on the turn, came out into upper stretch then dropped back in again and finished well but reached his best stride too late. MATTY'S MARAUDER was ridden
along towards the rear, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch then steadied behind horses, altered out inside the three-sixteenths and
failed to threaten. JACKS AMERICAN PIE was ridden along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor.

response. MR FANTASY bumped hard with a rival at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn and tired.
