finished full of run to win going away. DYNAMITE CLOUD vied for the lead along the inside, loomed boldly nearing the furlong marker then was no match for
the winner. FOREVERJUMBONMIKE stalked the pace into the stretch and finished with good courage two wide. KEEPING SCORE moved up three wide
on the turn then came up empty. WHISKEY HELPS broke a step slow, hopped out of the gate and was no factor. NOT QUITE WRIGHT broke in front, set
the pace with a clear early lead, maintained the advantage to the top of the stretch then tired. FAMILY JET trailed.

Footnotes
ALL AMERICAN JEWEL chased the pace into the far turn, rallied two wide to make the lead nearing the quarter pole, shook clear and lasted under right
handed urging. BELLA DUDETTE trailed far back early, closed with a rush four wide while lugging in under left handed urging and just missed.
RACINROSEMARY moved up three wide into the far turn then was outfinished. FASHION FRAME broke in front, set the pace with a clear lead through the
far turn then weakened. SPRING CITY GAL between horses, shifted out to the six path entering the stretch then lacked the needed response. DARK BLUE
FLAME offered a mild bid along the rail on the second turn then came up empty. PATSY'S BIG GIRL unhurried early, was in tight entering the stretch.
LILAC LACE well placed, drifted to the eight path entering the stretch then faltered.

FORT RAMSEY never far back, rallied three wide to make the lead under left handed urging in deep stretch and lasted by the narrowest of margins. HIGH
RISK STRATEGY unhurried early, closed fast four wide through the stretch and just missed getting up in time. BRODYTHEOXMAN trailed into the far turn
then found his best stride late five wide. LOVELY HEIR broke in front, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished. SAY HEY KID failed to menace.
BOB'S CALLING stalked the pace along the inside into the stretch and faded late. ALFRED was through after a half. ENJOY THE MUSIC had speed from
the start, loomed boldly two wide into the far turn, had speed into the stretch then came up empty.

Footnotes
POWERFUL PHIL dueled foe the lead two wide into the turn, set the balance of the pace and prevailed under confident handling. OL' NED stalked the pace
into the stretch, dug in along the rail late and was steadily cutting into the winners advantage in the final strides. BOOTS FOR COWBOYS dueled with the
winner along the inside into the stretch and faded late. CATMAN JACK trailed into the stretch, swung wide and found his best stride late five wide.
VENTURE ON failed to menace. BABA LOOEY was no threat. BILLY BEACOUP was no factor. TURBO POWER was through after a half. ALDUIN was
outrun.
