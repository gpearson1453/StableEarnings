Footnotes
BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE raced six wide early, then stalked close up three wide, chased on the far turn, bid at the quarter pole, rallied outside of LOUIE'S
WISH in the stretch drive and wore down that rival late to prevail. LOUIE'S WISH set the pace in the two path, briefly shook free entering the far turn, dueled
into the lane, dug in gamely inside of the winner in the final furlong and battled on determinedly to the finish. AHSAD raced close up on the rail, chased the
leaders on the far turn, angled out and rallied mildly outside. SUPERHIGHWAY was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside and rallied mildly on the rail.
DUBROVSKY raced off the pace with and inside trip and failed to threaten. AMERICAN ROMA was off slowly, raced off the rail, off the pace and failed to
rally. DIAMOND SETTER raced four wide early, continued three wide off the pace and lacked a rally. RINGS OF JUPITER raced off the pace between
horses and failed to threaten. YONDERING raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. CANTSTOPRUNNING raced five wide early, then stalked three
wide and gave way.

STARINTHEMAKING broke slowly, swung wide into the stretch and surged clear while kept to his task. BIG CITY RALPH dropped far behind inside, split
rivals rallying in the stretch to get up for the place. JUPI'S LIGHTNING earned a narrow advantage outside and continued gamely to the finish. LEGAL
GUMP forced the pace along the inside then flattened out in the stretch. DIG CHARLIE DIG settled just off the leaders outside and lacked a closing kick. IN
EQUALITY saved ground off the pace, made a brief bid on the final turn then faded. OFF DUTY rated just behind the dueling leaders and gave way.
METHODICAL lagged far behind throughout. BOAT OVER THE HILL saved ground far back and was always outrun.

Footnotes
BESS rated three wide close up, dueled throughout and wore down the pacesetter following a long drive in a determined score. LEAN ON E vied outside,
led inside on the final turn and held on gamely to the finish. SWEET WILLEMINA reserved between foes, split rivals rallying on the final turn then went
evenly late. MISS DILLINGHAM in hand just off the leaders inside, continued willingly in the stretch. FINE ONE WON lunged at the break, rushed close up
wide then faded late. MISS LOYALTY trailed for five furlongs then passed rivals without menacing. SUGAR STREAK inside early, moved very wide on the
final turn and in the stretch. TOMARIE was fanned very wide into the first turn and lacked a response. SENSE A MILLION led briefly, vied to the three
eighths pole and faltered. ASSUME CONTROL dropped back outside and was never in contention. LORDEN'S LOVE reserved inside, raced within range
then stopped on the final turn. FED POLICY lacked speed and was never in contention.

Footnotes
INDIAN COUNSELOR vied inside for the lead, dueled on the backside, shook free on the far turn, responded when asked, turned back a bid from the runner
up and drew clear under urging. NOON TIME GEM raced off the pace, advanced quickly between rivals on the far turn, made a bid at the quarter pole, dug
in gamely outside of the winner in the stretch run and came up second best. ARRIVEDERCI was bumped at the start, pulled and steadied entering the first
turn, settled two wide off the pace, came five wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. KINGS HIGHWAY raced off the pace inside, closed belatedly in
the two path and was up late for fourth. TERRY'S CHARM was reluctant to load, raced four wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace, steadied midway on
the far turn and lacked a rally. ECLIPSED MOON steadied at the start, raced off the pace, advanced on the turn, came three wide into the lane and lacked a
rally. COLOUR GUARD chased inside and tired. NOBIZ LIKE JETBIZ stalked the leaders, then chased, lacked a bid and tired. CHARLIE THE GREEK
raced four wide early, settled three wide off the pace and failed to threaten. AULD LANGE SYNE stumbled at the start and was bumped, raced off the pace
inside and did not factor. REFI was off a bit slow, raced four wide at the half mile marker and did not factor. DEVINE DENTAL vied two wide for the lead,
dueled on the backside, then chased and gave way.
