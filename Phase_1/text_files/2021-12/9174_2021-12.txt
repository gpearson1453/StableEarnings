SHASTALOO slow early saved ground surging clear in upper stretch angling out a touch while drawing off. UNTIL NOW sent hard chased through the turn
angling to mid track in upper stretch extending late to salvage place. A MERRY PRANKSTER pressed then chased to upper stretch, though no match for
the winner continued to battle for minor placings. LUCKY TUESDAY hustled out set the pace through the turn being overpowered from the inside in upper
stretch coming up a bit short in the three path. SKY slow early lost ground to upper stretch finishing evenly six wide. CEVICHE was never involved.
MONGOLIAN ANGEL was always outrun.

HIGH ROLLING DUDE gained on the backside hooking foe on the far turn tightening up rival down the lane edging clear. DAYLIGHT moved on pace
carrying a narrow lead to the far turn dueling inside of rival there to upper stretch being tightened up inside the eighth pole ceding grudgingly late.
STRIKEITORTAPIT prompted the pace giving chase on the far turn racing evenly through the lane. DOUBLE THE LAUGH slow early saved ground to
upper stretch finishing evenly along the inside. BARITONE played no factor. NEEDABETTERJOCK stalked the pace chasing four wide on the far turn fading
into upper stretch. CABO HEADACHE was always outrun.
