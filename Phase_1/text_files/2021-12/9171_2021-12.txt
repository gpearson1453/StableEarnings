Footnotes
HARD TO DENY dueled for the lead with STACKIN SILVER while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by DYNAMIC RULER nearing the quarter,
vied with that rival and finally was taken on by RAAGHEB nearing the sixteenth pole and held that rival safe in a game effort. RAAGHEB was reserved just
off the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, angled back inside into the lane, reached the winner nearing the sixteenth pole, vied but
could not get by that rival. ARIZONA MOON was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady bid. DYNAMIC
RULER was away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied and gave way in the drive.
LOOSE DIAMOND showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. STACKIN SILVER broke sharply to dispute the
pace with the winner from the inside and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
RIVER JUMPER sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and held sway to the
wire. FORTY NINE MODEL chased the winner while racing three-wide, could not reach that rival in the drive but finished well to hold the place. TEQUILA
MARY showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, moved between foes in mid-stretch, angled in nearing the quarter and finished well when
clear. LOOPY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. MALIBU MISTRESS was void of early foot, saved
ground through the turn and failed to rally. SONGOFTHEDESERT was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and gradually weakened.
FORTHELOVEOFLYDIA chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going three furlongs.

Footnotes
SEMI SWEET raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and was up late. BOLD REY broke
sharply to press the pace from the inside, opened a clear margin approaching the stretch, drifted in and bumped LADY LANA in mid-stretch, was quickly
straightened away and just missed in a game effort. LADY LANA was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, was
pushed inward and bumped in mid-stretch and finished willingly when clear. JUST CLASSY settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out with a furlong
to run and failed to gain late. SURE ANGEL raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. MISS
IMPORTANT was void of early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not reach contention. IKNOWYOURFACE was away in good order to
set a pressured pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERING THE BUMPING
BETWEEN LADY LANA AND BOLD REY IN MID-STRETCH AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THEY CONCLUDED BOLD REY HAD CAUSED THE
INFRACTION BY DRIFTING IN AND WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD.

Footnotes
CHICKS DIG MUNNY pressed the pace from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the three-eighths pole, opened a clear margin and was ridden
out to the wire. FOUR SCORE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished willingly.
ADRIENNE'S PROGENY was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing five-wide, stayed on well in the drive but failed to gain late. WIN LIKE
COACH P was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out nearing the quarter and finished evenly late. MINI MAGS disputed the
pace while racing three-wide from between for and gave way through the final furlong. RANDOM PLEASURE was off slow, raced unhurried early, raced off
the rail through the turn and was not a factor. RATIONAL was void of early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace. UNUSUAL SECRET
lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. HEAVENLY ARCH showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn
and did not threaten.

Footnotes
TIZ MANNY was away in good order to press the pace of ROUSING RUBBLE from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the three-eighths
marker, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off with something left. GREY POINT was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through
the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. ROUSING RUBBLE broke sharply to set a pressured pace and gave
way to the winner after going a half. TIGER'S SONG settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly. MO GEE was void
of early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and did not threaten. TIME TO ZOOM chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way through the
final furlong. PREMIER LEAGUE was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. BRETT settled off the leaders
from the inside and gradually gave way. PAPA'S HONEY lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. SMILING MATT raced
off the pacesetters early, moved seven-wide through the turn and weakened. MI MALDITO AMOR showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn
and did not menace. JUGGLES raced off the leaders throughout and gradually weakened.
