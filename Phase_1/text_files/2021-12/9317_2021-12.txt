Footnotes
HOT SEAN stalked the early pace outside of rivals, was asked for run nearing the three-sixteenths marker, confronted the leaders approaching the furlong
marker under a firm hand-ride and edged clear in the end. THAT'S BIND BABE tracked the pacesetter through the backstretch run, vied leaving the turn,
was in tight and brushed with GOBSMACK in the final sixteenth and was outfinished in the late going. GOBSMACK stalked the pace from an inside position,
vied for the lead inside of the furlong marker, was in tight and brushed with THAT'S BIND BABE in the final sixteenth and closed to just miss for second
while holding for the show. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET was away alertly and set the pace from a ground saving position, was confronted nearing the furlong
marker and weakened in the late going. CAJUN BETTOR chased the pace from a two wide path and was not a factor. KATZUMOTO settled off of the early
pace, was four wide on the turn and was not a threat.

WHAT UP NOW J T was away alertly and was hustled to set the pace, was pressured by the runner-up nearing the top of the stretch but turned that bid
away and kicked clear in the end. ARISTEIA tracked the pace from a three wide position, pressured the winner nearing the top of the stretch but was turned
away and kept on to be best of the rest. BIG BRAND was forwardly placed while stalking the pace from a four wide path on the turn and weakened in the
stretch run. RIVIERA SUNRISE pressed the early pace into the turn, showed greenness while lugging out on the turn, lost position approaching the top of
the stretch and did not have a late response. HARBOR ABBEY settled off of the early pace, was three wide on the turn and was not a factor. ELIANA
CHAMP chased the pace from a two wide path and gave way in the late stages.

TRAFFIC STOPPER was sent to set the early fractions while being prompted, gained ground on chasing foes inside of the furlong marker but was
challenged inside of the final sixteenth by oncoming rivals, was urged using firm right-handed encouragement and just lasted. AUSTRIAN NAVY sat off of
the early pace, mounted a four to five wide rally on the turn, continued that run in the stretch to gain on the winner in the final sixteenth and just missed for
the win while winning the nod for the place. LIAM'S SECRET settled just off of the early fractions, ran in tandem with AUSTRIAN NAVY approaching the
head of the stretch to gain ground on TRAFFIC STOPPER, closed well inside of AUSTRIAN NAVY in the final sixteenth and just missed for the win and
place. SWEET KAELA chased the early pace from the inside, was still in contention nearing the furlong marker but weakened in the late going. KISS RIDE
GOODBYE tracked the pace from a three wide path and tired in the stretch run. FIREITUP tracked the pace from a two wide path and gave way in the
stretch drive.

CHUMLY was hustled leaving the break to set the fractions while being prompted, was chased into the lane by NIGHT PROOF and was able to hold that foe
at bay in the late stages to prevail. NIGHT PROOF pressed the pace from a three wide path along the turn, edged closer to CHUMLY leaving the turn but
could not reel in that winner and was outkicked in the late going. KEEP ON DANZING stalked the early pace from a ground saving position and was
outfinished in the stretch run. BOB'S REIGN sat off of the early pace, was two to three wide on the turn and offered a mild late gain in the stretch. ONE
LAST THOUGHT chased the early pace from a four wide position and weakened in the drive. WELL CRAFTED bobbled at the start and was slow in the
early going, was two wide on the turn and did not offer a late rally. SPLIT ACES stalked the pace along the inside, lost ground on the turn and gave way in
the late going. HAKUNUI had no early speed, saved ground along the turn and was not a factor.

DANIELA BELLA stalked the early pace, mounted a two wide bid to challenge CITY GLITTER nearing the top of the stretch, found a stubborn foe in the
runner-up and wore that foe down in the final sixteenth to prevail. CITY GLITTER was away alertly and set the fractions while in hand, saved ground through
the turn, met the bid of DANIELA BELLA leaving the turn but could not hold her off in the late going while holding for the place. THE PHARAOH'S GIRL
chased the early pace, improved position on the turn while four wide and while not able to reel in the top pair finished willingly in the drive. LIVIN' AT THE
BU saved ground while stalking the early pace and lacked a late kick in the stretch run. SHEZARUNAWAY chased the pace from a two wide position and
weakened in the stretch drive. ALL tracked the early pace from a three wide path, lost ground along the turn and gave way in the late going.

SKY ON ICE was unhurried in the early stages, improved position on the second turn while two wide between foes, angled out for the stretch run and
surged in the final sixteenth to catch the runner-up and prevail. TORQUAY was a bit rank on the first turn and steadied off of heels, saved ground through
the backstretch run, was two wide on the second turn, vied for the lead leaving the turn, led into the final sixteenth but was caught in the final strides by SKY
ON ICE while besting the rest. ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) was unhurried through the backstretch run, was three wide on the second turn and rallied well
leaving the bend to claim the show. LA REINE'S LEGACY was away well and set the pace while being prompted, saved ground through the second turn,
was still in contention inside of the furlong marker but weakened in the late going. SUMMER APPARITION was a bit hard to load and was away slowly,
gained ground outside of rivals from the four to five path on the second turn and was outfinished in the stretch run. GRIGORO was forwardly placed while
stalking the pace through the turn and did not have a late response. SONG OF FIRE prompted the pace through the second turn, felt pressure from
oncoming rivals approaching the head of the stretch and tired in the late going. HALF HOPING stalked the pace from the second flight through the second
turn and gave way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
AMERICAN FARMER stalked the early pace outside of rivals, was roused while four to five wide on the second turn to confront the weakening pacesetter,
put away a stubborn foe in DULAS inside of the final furlong and held to prevail over the oncoming runner-up under firm right-handed encouragement.
TESORO was jostled at the start then was hustled to sit just off of the early fractions, was pinched in tight quarters in the upper second turn, mounted a four
wide rally into the stretch and pressured the winner late but was not able to reel him in while besting the rest. DULAS (IRE) made an early move to track the
pace along the backstretch, was three wide between foes while vying for the lead into the stretch, battled back against AMERICAN FARMER but could not
hold him off and was outfinished in the late going. WINE AND WHISKY was bumped at the start and settled toward the rear of the field in the early stages,
lacked racing room while three wide on the second turn, was steered out for the drive and closed willingly in the final sixteenth. DESCARTES saved ground
while stalking the pace from the midflight and did not offer a late rally. I'MGONNABESOMEBODY was away well and was sent to set a pressured pace from
the inside, was asked for more run nearing the quarter-marker and weakened in the stretch run. COOL MOUNTAIN LAD settled off of the early pace, was
three wide on the second turn and lacked a late rally. SACRED RIDER was jostled at the start and was away slowly, settled toward the rear of the field
through the backstretch run, was four wide on the second turn and was not a threat. TED was sent to contest the pace through the backstretch run, was
under a tight hold along the backstretch, gave ground entering the second turn and gave way in the late stages. READY SAY GO was forwardly placed
through the backstretch run while tracking the early pace, improved position to vie for the lead nearing the quarter-marker and faded in the stretch run.
SYNTHESIS was jostled at the start and was away very slowly, sat off of the pace through the backstretch run, saved ground on the second turn and was
not a factor. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START INVOLVING THE INCIDENTS WITH TESORO, SYNTHESIS, SACRED
RIDER AND WINE AND WHISKY AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION DETERMINED THAT THOSE RUNNERS ALL MADE MUTUAL CONTACT AT THE
BREAK AND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
NUESTRO ENGREIDO pressed the early pace from MOB BOSS, made a two wide bid nearing the quarter-marker to collar that foe and pulled away in the
end. NORTH SEA stalked the pace outside of foes into the turn, improved position while three wide approaching the top of the lane and was outfinished in
the stretch run. CHIEF WILD EAGLE stalked the pace from a two wide path on the turn and finished evenly in the drive. MOB BOSS was away quickly and
set the pace from the inside, was collared by the winner nearing the quarter-marker and weakened in the stretch run. BLESSED BROTHER chased the
pace from the inside and gave way in the late going. THECHIEFHASTRICKS chased the pace from a three wide path on the turn and faded in the stretch.
GOOD FOCUS was away slowly, was hustled to make a middle move in the upper turn but could not sustain that bid and quickly lost ground and was eased
through the stretch.
