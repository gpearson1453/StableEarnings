Footnotes
SECRETARY AT WAR forwardly placed along the inside in the run up the backstretch, steered out in some traffic late in the turn, challenged three wide
turning for home, shook clear nearing the furlong marker, wrapped up late to win ridden out. TIZ SHOWBIZ outrun early along the inside, continued to save
ground early in the turn, angled out after being roused midway on the bend, rallied widest through the lane, finished willingly to be up late for the place, no
threat to the winner. BOURBON COWBOY chased the early leader off the inside, pressed that one from between rivals through the turn, could not keep up
with the winner through the lane, caught late for the place. SMART TIME broke sharp, cleared to the inside, set the pace for a half, weakened steadily in the
drive. TWO DOT forwardly placed for four furlongs on the outside, faded through the lane. SEEK N JUSTICE remained back while racing in the two path.
SUPER WISE broke a bit to the outside, had little left for the stretch run while three wide. ARCH ABILITY off a step slow, finished early in remaining back
while racing four wide.

Footnotes
KANTEX forwardly placed in the two path, moved slightly closer to the rail when clear early in the turn, shook clear when straightened for home and was
kept to task in the run to the wire. DANCIN N THEPULPIT pressed the winner from the outside, chased that one turning for home, could do little with that
one through the stretch, clearly second best. DERONDA within striking distance early inside, moved out, raced in the second flight between rivals turning for
home, no match for the top two while drawing clear of the others. ANGIE'S REVRAC vied early inside the winner, shuffled back slightly when that one came
in a bit early in the turn, weakened. CHAI TEA void of early foot, raced three wide through the turn, picked off a couple tiring rivals while not a serious threat.
WAR SHOES in the second group while outside, three wide into the lane, had little left for the stretch run. LIL' BIT OF CHROME fell back, despite feeling
pressure into the turn, failed to menace. SHINING TERRI last away, one paced while three wide, failed to menace. CALICO TABBY void of speed, improved
slightly with a mild middle move when saving ground turn, gave way in the drive.

I'M THE BOSS OF ME broke on top, narrowly showed the way early between foes, cleared in the turn, steadily increased advantage to the wire, ridden out.
MONTGOMERY PARK pressed the issue early on the outside, chased the winner through the turn, no match for that one through the stretch, held sway for
the place. LEGENDARY GIFT broke back, moved outside, four wide through the turn when improving, slowly getting to the runner up. NISI PRIUS lightly
bumped early then steadied, raced back, three wide into the lane, improved position without posing a serious threat. SIMONA'S CHOICE in the second
group while racing outside, moved slightly closer while four wide midway on the turn, weakened in the drive. A REAL JEWEL settled off the pace and the
inside, dropped inside in the turn and tired. OFF WE GO settled in mid pack, had little for the drive. DUCHESS BUBBLES last away, trailed for most of the
way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals. SUPER WONDER GIRL remained always back. SMARTY'S ANGEL lightly bumped with NISI PRIUS lightly just after
the start, raced forwardly up the backstretch, gave way early in the turn.

Footnotes
COST A FORTUNE with the early pace along the inside, took command turn, clear into the lane, increased advantage in upper stretch then held the runner
up comfortably safe late under steady handling. KEINO broke a step slow then steadied, raced back early as a result, dropped inside midway on the turn,
rallied up the inside to be clear for the place while slowly carving into the winner's advantage. UNDECODED in the second flight off the inside, continued to
race one paced through the turn and into the lane just off the inside, finished up in continued even fashion to finish up best of the others. AIN'T SHE A
PISTOL within striking distance off the inside, three wide through the turn when in continued pursuit, came up empty for the final furlong. CHARLOTTES
WAY narrowly showed the way in the two path up the backstretch, headed early in the turn, began a steady retreat turning for home. CANDY'S STORY
raced in mid pack while three wide, failed to threaten in the drive. GAME OF INCHES void of early foot inside, angled out turning for home and picked off a
couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. WILD BIZNESS remained back while racing four wide through the turn. PEPPER POINT was off slowly, finished
before a half.

Footnotes
THE MARY ROSE forwardly placed three wide, advanced and challenged on the outside in the three path final turn, clear into the lane, well clear. FIRE
CORAL off slow, dropped inside soon after, unhurried up the backstretch, advanced, angled out four wide in some traffic and advancing late in the final turn,
long drive for the place while widest, game for that position, no threat to the winner. BOLD TACTICS moved off the inside when off the pace, crept closer in
the final turn between horses, traffic late in that bend, outkicked for the second position while between horses. WILLFUL WOMAN settled toward the inside
in mid pack, advanced in the two path final turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker, weakened the final sixteenth. SUN PATH lacked speed while
well out in the strip, pulled onto the backstretch, moved slightly closer on the outside far turn, four wide into the lane, flattened out in the drive. TEXAS RAIN
broke on top, showed the way into the first turn, relinquished the advantage before a quarter, pressed that rival the middle half and gave way. A BROKEN
BREEZE broke in mid pack, was used to advance then dropped inside to take control the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch then gave way when
headed into the far turn. LADY MCKENZIE off the pace and the inside, four wide into the lane, trailed home.

Footnotes
STURGILL shook clear soon after the start, continued to show the way through the turn in the two path by daylight, enough left to hold the runner up at bay
in the final strides. ULTIMATE settled early off the pace and the inside, roused three wide when moving a bit closer late in the turn, continued to steadily
gain on the winner to the wire to miss, well clear for the place. DON'T FORGET broke back, lacked speed, moved closer three wide and in traffic late the
turn, chased the top two past the furlong marker, proved no match for that pair late, narrowly held the show. CAVE RUN off a step sloe, trailed for a half,
swung out wide turning into the stretch, improved position with some late interest well out in the strip. YODEL E. A. WHO forwardly placed along the inside,
tired through the stretch. RIVERBOAT GAMBLER bobbled slightly at the break, saved ground to no avail. LOOKIN FOR EIGHT back off the pace, four wide
through the turn, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. LONELY PRIVATE chased the winner early and began a steady retreat just before a
half. ARCHIEMYBOY broke alertly, fell back off the pace well wide, four path late in the turn, shifted out widest for the drive and trailed home.

Footnotes
APPREHEND away in good order, in the second flight well out in the strip backstretch, four wide turn, set down for the drive, up in time. FAVORITE
OUTLAW broke forwardly, maintained inside position exiting the chute, moved out a bit and pressed the leader in the two path backstretch and into the turn,
bid late in the bend, lugged in a bit nearing the furlong marker, gained command, led late, nipped final strides. INSOLITO broke alertly, cleared the field
soon after, showed the way along the inside into and through the turn, gave ground grudgingly to the top two. PAPA ROCKET settled in the second group
along the inside, saved ground through the turn, went evenly through the stretch to finish up evenly. WINTERWOOD back off the pace, raced three out to
four wide and between horses into and through the turn, improved position a bit in the drive without posing a serious threat. MUMAYAZ settled in the second
group while between foes into and through the turn, four wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick. ROME forwardly placed early outside, four wide turning for
home, tired. G T THREE FIFTY raced in mid pack early, dropped inside midway on the turn, had little for the drive. NAPA VALLEY balked at loading, raced
four wide throughout and made little impact. CLANCY'S PISTOL broke bank and never menaced. MR FROST dwelt then was rank a bit at the break,
remained always back. OFF THE CUFF was finished early, well beaten.

Footnotes
SECRET OATH settled off the pace and the inside, moved closer in the second turn in the two path, briefly waited midway on the final turn, steered out,
challenged on the outside and drove well clear the final furlong. MATAREYA broke sharp, settled off the pace and the inside challenged the leaders in the
second turn while three wide, proved no match for the winner the final furlong, clear of the others. MISS CHAMITA settled off the pace while saving all the
ground, continued along the inside final turn, angled out turning for home, mild interest down the lane to be clear of the others. HYPERSPORT broke in
good order, set a quick and pressured pace along the inside, began to falter when the real running began at the head of the lane. KNOWING GLANCE mid
pack while off the inside, three wide through the final turn, lacked a closing kick. BENEDICT CANYON pressed the lively pace in the two path, gave way in
the drive. IMPULSUS broke slow, passed a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. RED HOT MESS four wide in the first turn, tired from those early
efforts. CUPID'S MUSIC broke back and was never involved.

MELTING SNOW outrun early, four wide into the turn, swung five wide exiting, finished with good energy out in the strip to prove best. KABOOM BABY
steadied at the start, void of speed while three wide through the turn, steered out widest for the drive, finished full of run down the middle of the strip and
was going best of all at the end. JOYFUL CADENCE away well, forwardly placed while three wide, challenged into the stretch, vied past the furlong marker,
proved no match for the top two late, clear of the rest. WELL SPENT within striking distance outside, four wide through the turn, challenged and put a head
in front past the furlong marker, could not last. PALM COTTAGE broke back, moved up toward the inside, in traffic late backstretch, two path through the
turn, came up empty for the drive. MIZ BLUE broke sharp, set a pressured pace for a half, weakened when headed upper stretch. SUNNY ISLE BEACH
broke back, lacked speed, three wide through the turn, passed a few tiring rivals while not a serious threat. HARD STREET lacked speed inside, saved
ground turn, improved into the lane then flattened out. CODE NAME KATE in mid pack while off the inside, floated out four wide turning for home, tired
down the lane. OSCARETTE broke in, pressed the pace off the inside, gave way through the stretch. LET'S CRUISE in mid pack off the inside, was finished
