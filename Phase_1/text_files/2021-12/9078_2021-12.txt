Footnotes
SUNSET STAR was away alertly then settled just off of the pace through the backstretch, mounted a two wide bid on the second turn to collar the
pacesetter, was under firm left-handed encouragement through the lane and held over an oncoming rival to prevail. FRONT OF LINE (GB) settled in the
early stages, made a four to five wide bid on the second turn, gained ground through the stretch and made a late push to challenge the winner but missed in
that effort while besting the rest. ARISTEIA stalked the pace through the backstretch, was three wide on the second turn and closed well in the stretch to be
a clear third. TENDERONI was hustled along the first turn to set the fractions, saved ground on the second turn, was collared leaving the turn and tired in
the late going. LOCHMARA was rank in the run into the first turn, settled at the rear of the field through the backstretch while saving ground and did not
really in the drive. KIND BUT SHE LIES was forwardly placed to stalk the pace through the backstretch, lost ground while three wide on the second turn and
weakened in the stretch.

sixteenth but felt late pressure from the oncoming runner-up and held to prevail. HEAT SEEKING LETA settled off of the pace, was in tight while two wide
on the turn, rallied along the rail leaving the turn and pressured the winner in the late going but could not reel her in while a clear second over the rest.
AROUSE N GO chased the pace while saving ground along the turn, lost ground off of the turn and weakened in the stretch run. BLUEGRASS SKY stalked
the pace from a three wide position and did not mount a late rally. LADY MOHICAN pressed the pace into the turn, lost ground into the stretch and tired in

AFFECTIONTO AUTISM was away alertly, came over a path nearing the half-mile marker, set the pace into the turn while being prompted by YOU'RE THE
CAUSE, shook free of that foe leaving the turn, was kept to task through the stretch to hold off the oncoming runner-up but edged clear in the end. CHIEF
WILD EAGLE was hustled leaving the break, checked at the half-mile pole in tight quarters while going for the lead, tracked the pace on the turn while three
wide and kept on in the stretch to keep the winner's attention and bested the rest. YOU'RE THE CAUSE prompted the pace through the turn, was two wide
between horses nearing the top of the stretch, gave ground leaving the bend and was outfinished in the late going. ENJOY IT STRAIT hopped at the start
and was green in the early going, improved position on the turn while two wide and finished evenly in the drive. FANTASTIC DREAM settled off of the pace,
was two wide on the turn and did not offer a late rally in the stretch run. BLUE SILVER had no speed in the early stages, was four wide on the turn and was
not a factor. SIERRA SNOW STORM settled off of the early pace, was three wide on the turn and was not a threat.

to task through the final furlong and drew clear in the end. I LOVE ROMANCE dueled with the winner in the early going for pace duties, gave ground into the
turn while along the inside, was outfinished in the stretch but held to share for the place. AMBER LOUISE tracked the early pace, was three wide on the
turn, was outfinished in the stretch but held to save in a dead heat for the place. NAMORITA had no early speed, saved ground on the turn and closed
willingly in the stretch run. WHERE'S FRANKIE chased the pace from a four wide position and was outkicked in the late going. ST. ANNIE'S INDY settled
off of the early pace, was four wide on the turn and did not rally in the stretch.

MALIBU GHOST was away alertly and set the fractions, saved ground on the turn, felt a bit of pressure from DR. FLASH DANCER leaving the turn but was
urged in the lane while on the left lead and edged clear in the end. LOVE THAT KID stalked the early pace, was three to four wide on the turn and closed
well in the stretch to claim the place. DR. FLASH DANCER chased the early pace, gained ground while three wide on the turn to mildly pressure MALIBU
GHOST into the stretch but was outfinished in the late going, while clear for third. LOVER BOY TOM was off the pace in the early going, was two wide on
the turn, improved position through the stretch, was blocked inside of the furlong marker by a tiring rival but finished willingly in deep stretch. SPLIT ACES
tracked the early pace, lost ground on the turn while two wide and weakened in the stretch run. QUIRKY CHAOS tracked the pace from a two wide position
on the turn, tired in the drive and drifted in a bit inside of the furlong marker. WELL CRAFTED veered out at the start and had no early speed, was four wide
on the turn and was not a threat. QUEEN'S MARQUE settled off of the early pace, was four wide on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BACK RING LUCK took command of the early pace on the first turn, traveled comfortably through the backstretch, was challenged on the second turn by
NOWHERE MAN, lost the lead to that foe, came back in the final sixteenth and gamely dug in to prevail in a blanket finish. GALLANT WARREN tracked the
early pace, was three wide between rivals on the second turn while contesting the lead, lost a bit of ground leaving the turn but kept on to vie inside of the
final sixteenth and just missed for the win while sharing for the place. NOWHERE MAN took a ground saving trip while stalking the pace into the second
turn, mounted an inside bid on the second turn to take the lead into the stretch, was urged in the late going and was tagged on the line by the winner while
sharing for the place. GOVENOR'S PARTY settled off of the pace, was four wide on the second turn and made a mild late bid in the stretch. LYMEBYRD
stalked the pace into the second turn while four wide and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
TWILIGHT EMPIRE sat just off of the early pace, mounted a three wide bid on the turn to confront the dueling pacesetters, led into the stretch, was kept to
task through the lane and held in a drive over the oncoming runner-up. LIVIN' AT THE BU stalked the early pace from a two wide position, mounted a bid
leaving the turn to gain ground into the stretch, lugged in at the furlong marker, bumped CLEVER CHIEFTESS and closed in the late going for the place,
while clear of the rest. CLEVER CHIEFTESS set contested fractions through the turn while saving ground, lost the lead leaving the turn, was bumped
sharply by LIVIN' AT THE BU at the furlong marker and weakened in the late stages. ACHROMATIC settled at the rear of the field while two wide and did
not have a final kick in the stretch. SUGAR PLUM chased the pace from a two wide position on the turn, avoided the spill inside of the furlong marker and
was not asked for run in the late going. NIGHTBIRD settled off of the pace while saving ground, jumped the fallen rider and horse at the furlong marker and
was not asked for run in the late going. ZAFFERANA pressed the pace through the turn from a two wide position, gave ground leaving the turn, took up in
tight quarters at the furlong marker then clipped heels, lost the rider and walked off under her own power. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE FURLONG MARKER INVOLVING #4 ZAFFERANA CLIPPING HEELS AND FALLING AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION
RULED THAT #3 LIVIN' AT THE BU LUGGED IN AT THE EIGHTH POLE CAUSING ZAFFERANA TO TAKE UP AND ALSO CAUSING #2 CLEVER
CHIEFTESS TO BE BUMPED SHARPLY AT THAT SPOT AND DISQUALIFIED LIVIN' AT THE BU FROM SECOND TO SIXTH.

Footnotes
ORCZY (IRE) was unhurried in the early going, rated well along the backstretch, mounted a five wide bid on the second turn, improved position leaving the
turn to confront MONSTRODAMUS inside of the furlong marker and kicked clear in the end. SOUTHEAST ASIA tracked the pace, saved ground on the
second turn, was blocked leaving the turn and waited for racing room, found that room in the final sixteenth and closed well to claim the place. CURRY
NATION settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide on the second turn and rallied in the stretch under right-handed urging to claim the show.
MONSTRODAMOUS was four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace through the backstretch, was two wide on the second turn, mounted a bid to take the
lead inside of the furlong marker but was caught by the winner and outkicked in the late going. ALLEYCAT was four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace
into the second turn, was three wide on the second turn and lacked a final kick in the stretch run. BROKEN FINGER saved ground while stalking the pace
into the second turn and did not have a late response. DARCEE'S LOVI DOVI was away in good order and set the fractions while under a snug hold through
the backstretch, led leaving the second turn but was caught at the furlong marker and tired in the drive. STORMING WARRIOR stalked the pace into the
backstretch, lost ground on the second turn while two wide, tired in the late going and was reported to have bled when pulled up after crossing the wire.

Footnotes
HEAT N REHEAT stalked the pace from a two wide path on the turn, gained ground into the stretch, took the lead nearing the furlong marker, felt mild late
pressure and dug in to prevail. ROBIE pressed the pace through the turn while saving ground, vied for the lead inside of the furlong marker but was
outkicked in the late going while holding for second. ELCONDOR stalked the pace from a three wide position on the turn, gained ground into the stretch and
was outfinished in the late stages. TALISKER BAY settled toward the rear early, was two wide on the turn, was gaining ground when drifted nearing the
quarter-marker and finished evenly in the drive. TRUTH TO POWER saved ground while sitting off of the pace on the turn and did not mount a late bid in the
stretch run. SAL MAGLIE hopped at the start and then was pinched back soon after the break, had no early speed, was five wide on the turn, was carried
out at the quarter-marker when TALISKER BAY drifted at that spot and did not offer a late rally. LEMON ZINGER was away alertly and set the contested
pace from the two path on the turn, was under pressure at the head of the lane and faded in the late going. JUNGLE ROAR chased the pace from a four
wide position on the turn, took up in tight quarters at the quarter-marker when TALISKER BAY drifted and had no late response in the stretch run.
