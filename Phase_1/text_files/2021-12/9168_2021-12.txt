WARRIOR'S DREAM pressed the winner throughout, altered course in mid stretch and could not gain late. LOOKS GOOD N A TUX was never far back
early, swung wide in the stretch but needed more late. HERO OF THE HOUR had good position on the inside and lacked a late kick. IRISH PROUD never
far back, lacked a late response. PORT HUNTER steadied in the first turn and was no threat. The rider of WARRIORS DREAM claimed foul against the
rider of KLAATU for alleged interference in the stretch. After viewing the tape the stewards took no action.

Footnotes
EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR raced mid pack early, rallied three wide in the stretch, closed determinedly and was up in the final strides. CAPTURED BY FATE
pressed early, rallied in the stretch, led between calls late and just missed. LONESOME PHIL set the pace until mid stretch, held grudgingly when hooked.
REINSURE allowed to settle early, improved late while no threat. MUST BE A MONSTER chased the speed until the top of the stretch, then tired. NO TIME
TO YAWN was no factor and bled. AWESOME OX had brief foot and was through early.
