Footnotes
RUMOHR REIGNS brushed at the start, pressed the pace, racing between rivals around the turn, dueled down the lane with READY EDGE and proved the
best late. READY EDGE was an early factor, raced outside around the turn, dueled down the stretch, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others.
JUST INDISCREET shot to the front, drove clear, saved ground around the turn and weakened down the stretch. RHYTHMIC RULER broke out, brushed
rival, pressed the pace, racing inside around the turn, checked, lacked running room and was outfinished for third. CROOKED BANKER lacked early speed
and showed little. QUADRAJET broke in, brushed start, raced near the back and was never a factor. SPANISH EAGLE always raced near the back and was
outrun.

MISS JANA bumped at the start, vied for the lead, pulled away and proved much the best. SASSY EMMA raced near the back, came around the turn four
wide, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. FLASHY MEG went to the front, saved ground and lacked a late kick.
MADAME JANE raced within contention, weakened and was no threat late. MERCURY HEAD pressed the early pace, saved ground around the turn and
weakened. VIV VIV VIV broke out, bumped rival, came around the turn wide and was never a threat.
