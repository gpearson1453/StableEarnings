Footnotes
STROLLIN THE BAYOU bumped an outer foe at the start, stalked along the inside around the first turn before tracking outside of the leading pair around the
far turn, ranged up to those rivals entering the lane, and kicked clear approaching the furlong grounds. LAGOM bumped with an inner foe at the start,
prompted the pace two wide, vied around the far turn, but was outkicked by an outer foe passing the quarter pole, tired in the final furlong, but just saved
place. QUINN MURPHY tracked two wide, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, then improved between horses in the final furlong, but missed reaching
place. EMBARRASSING trailed, took the far turn three wide, shifted to the four path while outside of QUINN MURPHY in upper stretch, stayed on along with
that foe through the lane, but was fended off by that rival for show. CHAMPAGNE HORIZON saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. GOOD
MONGOLIA took bumps from rivals on both sides soon after the start, set the pace inside of a pressing LAGOM, met that foe's bid around the far turn, then
STROLLIN THE BAYOU's bid entering the lane, and weakened inside of those foes in upper stretch.

Footnotes
UPHAM bumped with an inner foe before being put to a bit of crowded quarters between horses at the start, settled off of the pace two wide, commenced a
rally into the far turn, tipped outside of the leading trio in upper stretch while taking aim on a bidding CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT, determinedly grinded away at
that foe's margin leaving the furlong grounds, surged approaching the wire, and just got up. CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT stalked the leading pair in the two path,
ranged up outside of those foes around the far turn to bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, led passing the quarter pole, held sway through midstretch
as UPHAM pursued, game clung to a margin into deep stretch, but was nailed on the wire. DA GOLD ROOM bumped with an outer foe before an inner rival
put him to a bit of tight quarters, trailed along the inside around both turns, shifted to the five path at the three sixteenths pole, and stayed on to reach a
tiring TIO BIAS for show on the wire. TIO BLAS vied along the inside around the first turn before allowing his outer counterpart to clear into the backstretch,
pressed that foe from the outside shortly after, vied into the far turn, then from between horses turning for home, but was outkicked by his outer rival at the
quarter pole, tired through the final furlong, and was nailed for show. MY GUITAR saved ground off of the pace, came under urging leaving the three furlong
pole, then shifted off of the rail entering the lane, but failed to factor. PERFECTURE popped the gate opened pre-race, then was shuffling his feet just before
the start causing him to break slowly, tracked the pace in the three path while engaged in the bit, but was done early. KYLE'S BRO JIMMY set the pace
outside of TIO BLAS around the first turn, cleared and shifted to the rail entering the backstretch, met that foe's outside rebid at the half mile pole, then
another rivals bid at the five sixteenths, but weakened inside of those rivals at the quarter pole.

GIANNA'S GIFT set the pace along the inside, drew away from a pressing rival entering the lane, and inched clear under driving pressure through the final
furlong. MAGICAL PEAPOD pressed the leader from the outside, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, and was second best. SWEET BLINDNESS
tracked two to three wide, lost ground into the far turn, but regained chasing position around that bend, then failed to bid and held show.
WATRUGONNADOKAREN tracked along the inside, but faltered to last into the far turn, then failed to factor. MALIBU MOIRA laid off of the pace three to
four wide early on, improved position two wide and between horses into the far turn, saved ground off of the pace around that bend, but failed to sustain bid
and faded.

Footnotes
NOBRAG JUSTFACT tracked two wide, gained in the four path turning for home, bid at the three sixteenths pole, led shortly after before kicking clear at the
furlong grounds, and held from an inner foe to the wire. SHARPENDUP saved ground off of the pace, improved to a pocket stalking position into the far turn,
but awaited racing room behind the leaders entering the lane, got outmoved by an outer bidding NOBRAG JUSTFACT in the process, then split foes at the
three sixteenths pole, rallied to bid inside of the aforementioned foe in the late stages, but did not have enough to catch him. TIZ LIGHT THE WAY stalked
two wide from the three path, then three wide around the far turn, bid entering the lane as a wider foe ranged up, but was outkicked by that rival in upper
stretch, then by an inner foe at the furlong grounds for place, but kept on thereafter. BLUERIDGE MOUNTAIN trailed along the inside, shifted four wide in
upper stretch, and moved up. CONVICT PIKE stalked along the inside, made rail bid for the lead at the seven sixteenths pole, vied inside of foes around the
far turn, briefly shook free of those rivals passing the quarter pole, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the three sixteenths pole, and faltered.
TIGERBEACH set the pace in the two path, met an inner foe's bid into the far turn, vied, but weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SERIOUSLY SASSY set the pace while staying in the three to two path around the turn, shifted back to the three path entering the lane, drew away from
chasing foes passing the quarter pole, and held sway to the wire. OURPERFECTPRINCESS needed to be backed out of the gate and evaluated pre-race,
was reloaded shortly after without incident, laid close up inside of the leader while in the two path, intently decided to not maneuver inside of the leader,
instead searched for racing room outside of that foe around the bend, shifted to the four path to accomplish that task, but failed to keep pace with the leader
in the process, then chased that foe home to prove second best. ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM broke a step slowly, settled at the rear, took the turn in the three
path, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and rallied between horses to claim show passing the furlong grounds. BLUEBIRD SING tracked from midpack two
wide and between horses, claimed show in upper stretch while chasing the leaders, but was outkicked for that position at the furlong pole. ROCKIN
SUNDAY rated at the rear in the two path around the turn, improved between horses while shifting o the five path approaching midstretch, and failed to
menace. PRINCESS RENEE laid off of the pace in the five to four path into the turn, got floated to the six path entering the lane, and failed to factor. A LOT
OF SPUNK tracked along the inside while under steady urging, then faded through the lane. HALLAJOORI stalked outside of the leader while in the four to
three paths into the turn, then got floated to the five path entering the lane while weakening.

Footnotes
KOUFAX set the pace, inched clear at the five furlong pole, managed an uncontested lead around the far turn, then drew off entering the lane, and was
ridden out to the wire. UNORTHODOX trailed, swung five wide entering the lane, and rallied outside of foes to reach place approaching the final sixteenth.
SCARY LARRY settled off of the pace along the inside, smoothly improved inside of foes turning for home, shifted three wide entering the lane, chased to
bid for place at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer rival for that position a sixteenth from home. WAR LIGHT laid far off of the pace two wide
around the first turn, then saved ground around the far turn, produced a rail rally through the lane, paused briefly behind a tiring COOL RUNNINGS at the
furlong grounds, then leveled off after slipping inside of that foe shortly after. CARTIER CAT tracked from the four to three path around the first turn, moved
two wide and between horses into the far turn, but steadied when shuffled behind a self-troubled YOUKILLINMECAT at the five sixteenths pole, but was not
severely costed position, then altered to the five path approaching midstretch, and stayed on mildly, but failed to reach inner foes for a minor share. COOL
RUNNINGS stalked along the inside, shifted two wide into the far turn, took aim on the clear leader turning for home, but failed to keep pace while proving
no match at the quarter pole, and weakened between horses leaving the furlong grounds. SCAT SHACK stalked three wide, came under a drive while being
floated four wide into the far turn, but faded entering the lane. INDIAN SPRINGS settled far off of the pace, took the far turn in the three path before
swinging six wide entering the lane, and made little impact. YOUKILLINMECAT stalked two wide, then three wide into the far turn, but steadied hard at the
five sixteenths pole after lugging inwardly as the rider searched for outer competition, then wilted between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
ICE BABY rushed early on to prompt the pace setter from the outside, shifted a path away from that foe while bidding entering the lane to create separation,
then assumed command in upper stretch, drew off under driving pressure at the furlong pole, and was wrapped up through the closing stages. LOVE OF
MY LIFE stalked behind the leading pair from the two path around the turn, shifted outside of those rivals entering the lane, chased the clearing leader
through midstretch to gain place passing the furlong pole, and was second best. BOURN set the pace inside of the eventual winner, but proved no match for
that foe in upper stretch, tired through the final furlong, but lasted for show. SECRET MELODY got herded outwardly by an inner foe at the start, rushed to
stalk outside of the leading pair, got floated four wide entering the lane, failed to keep pace with leading foes while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch,
but changed over inside the final three sixteenths, then failed to catch a tiring BOURN for show. AWESOME SAMANTHA broke outwardly multiple paths,
saved ground off of the pace around the bend, but failed to rally before fading. ZENCHUA SKY laid off of the pace three wide, and made little impact.
BURNING DESIRE raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, but tired through the lane. SHE'S CUSTOM MADE broke slowly, but avoided
trouble from inner rivals in the process, then trailed throughout and was outrun.

Footnotes
CELESTIAL FINISH set the pace inside of a vying ROMAN POET around the turn, shook clear of that rival passing the quarter pole, but drifted outwardly
while tiring passing the sixteenth pole as that rival gave chase, and lasted to the wire. ROMAN POET prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, but
failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart passing the quarter pole, chased that foe home well, closed in as that foe tired in the final furlong, altered
course back outside of that rival passing the sixteenth pole to attempt a rebid, but missed reaching that rival late. JESUIT bumped the gate at the start and
raced at the rear of the field two wide into the turn, but sustained a rail grind through the lane to catch outer foes for show on the wire. PESO IN MY
POCKET stalked three wide, but failed to keep pace with the leading pair entering the lane, tired through the final furlong, and was nailed on the wire by an
inner foe for show. CREME DE BALI tracked along the inside, shifted to three path in upper stretch, but failed to factor. SILENT POWER broke outwardly,
raced at the rear along the inside, but was outrun.

Footnotes
BRAVE NUGGET showed speed along the inside, dueled through the turn, shook clear in upper stretch, and drew off under driving pressure. MAC LEGACY
saved ground off of the pace, gained turning for home, split foes four wide in midstretch to vie for minor placings, but leveled off and just caught an inner foe
for place on the wire. LOOKING HOT stalked along the inside, attempted to move inside of the leader passing the quarter pole, but altered outside of that
rival when that rail gap closed, but only managed to chase that foe into midstretch, proved no match at the furlong grounds, then was nailed on the wire for
place. SWEET JACKIELEIGH tracked from midpack five wide and outside of foes around the turn, then stayed on, but failed to reach inner foes for a minor
share. STELLA LINK broke a step slowly and was forced inwardly at the start, settled at the rear two wide, shifted to the six path entering the lane, and
improved outside of rivals. HUSHED COURT ROOM took a bump from an inner foe at the start, stalked four to three wide into the turn, but came under
strong urging at the three furlong pole, sustained chasing position through upper stretch, but faded between horses at the furlong grounds.
SAYANOTHERPRAYER shied minorly from an outer foe at the start, trailed along the inside, shfited to the five path entering the lane, and passed tired foes.
SAVANNAH'S HERE broke inwardly, rushed between horses to vie for the lead two wide, dueled around the turn, but weakened in upper stretch. GRACE'S
VISION laid off of the pace two wide around the turn, and tired. DISTORTED KITTY broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, chased three wide and
between horses, but weakened at the three furlong pole.
