pressed the pace, raced three wide around the second turn, proved no match for the winner, but held on for second. LUCK OF THE STARS raced within
contention, saved ground around the final turn, made a rail bid and was outfinished for second. AS THUNDER HEART lacked early speed, showed late
interest, but was no factor. CABRO TORO raced near the middle of the field, came around the first turn seven wide, put forth an even effort and lacked a
rally. HARD KINGS vied for the early lead and faded. DUDE DROP KID raced in the middle of the field, came around the first turn six wide, saved ground
around the final turn and weakened. C. F. CONGRESS void of early speed and was never close. BIT PART broke a step slow, came in at the start, raced
green and was never a threat.

Footnotes
STREETTALKINHOTTIE raced near the back, had an outside trip, took the lead around the final turn, drove clear, was all out and held on for the win. OUR
AMEN lacked early speed, racing in the rear, moved up on the outside around the final turn, rallied down the lane and needed more ground. DREAMIT
showed early speed, eased back, made a wide bid, proved no match for the top two, but got up for show. SASSY SUE'S BAND raced in the middle of the
field, made a bid and got outfinished for show. BACK INTHAT ACTION vied for the early lead, saved ground around the turn and faded. DIALED J raced
near the middle of the field, put forth an even effort and lacked a bid. HEATHER DIVINE lacked early speed and was never close. GOLDEN EXPRESSO
pressed the pace and was finished early. CHATAIN'S FLYER vied on the front end, retreated to the back, lost contact with the field and was eased to wire.

PALM COURT dueled on the front end, forwardly placed throughout, pulled away down the stretch and proved the best. ONE TIME AROUND raced near
the middle of the field, saved ground around the second turn, made a bid, proved no match for the winner, but outfinished I GOT WINGS for second. I GOT
WINGS lacked early speed, moved up, within contention and was outfinished for second. TURF DANCER vied for the early advantage and faded. IN FOR A
PENNY pressed the early pace, raced outside around the second turn and faded. HATZILU IVRIT raced evenly near the back, saved ground around the
final turn and was never a factor. MY LITTLE GUERA always raced near the back and showed little. SILVER MAID refused.

FIRST EMPRESS unhurried in the early going, moved up on the outside around the second turn, entered the stretch six wide, rallied and drove clear before
the wire. MOSTLY AWESOME pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match late for the winner, but was best of others. LOVE TO
LEARN was an early factor, eased off the front, moved up around the final turn and got up for third. BAR TAP raced within contention, forwardly placed
throughout, made a bid and lacked a late kick. BLAZING CHARM lacked early speed and was never close. MISS BILLIE K dueled on the front end, saved
ground and dropped back.

was no factor. PARALISSFRMANALYSS lacked early speed, improved position, but was no threat. LONE STAR EXPRESS raced near the middle of the
pack and put forth an even effort. MY LITTLE JUNIOR raced within striking distance in the early part, came around the first turn on the outside, was carried
