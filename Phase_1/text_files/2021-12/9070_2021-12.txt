Footnotes
DIXIE PENNY within striking distance while off the inside, stalked through the turn off the inside, set down for the stretch run, long drive while drifting
slightly, late bid, up. ITSY BITSY BETTY broke alertly, sprinted clear and to the inside soon after, set the pace while continuing along the rail, maintained a
daylight advantage past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner while remaining clear for the second spot. QUALITY CHROME back off the pace
and the inside, dropped toward the inside for the drive, finished up best of the rest. MY CORALENA went one paced while remaining off the inside. MISS
ALPHA BELLA forwardly placed along the inside, weakened when the real running began into the stretch. BRIAR THICKET off a step slow, raced back,
steered out widest for the drive, failed to rally. CAGED BEAR broke back, was never a threat.

Footnotes
HOME BREW broke on top while brushing with a rival, vied early, cleared toward the inside before a quarter, set all the pace while continuing to save
ground, remained clear through the lane while being kept to task. WICKED GENIUS in the second flight while racing off the inside, chased the winner in the
two path into the lane, could do little with that one through the stretch, clear for the place. CHARTER OAK within striking distance along the inside,
continued to save ground through the final turn, evenly in the drive to finish up best of the rest. ROYAL CONNECTION broke out and was last away,
continued back into the far turn, moved a bit closer three wide turning for home, flattened out in the drive. JERRY'S EIGHTY prompted the winner off the
inside in the three path through the first turn, continued to force the issue up the backstretch, faltered in the drive. CATCH THE SMOKE in tight at the break,
raced back three wide, failed to muster a rally.

Footnotes
KNIGHT'S CROSS away in good order, pressed the issue the middle half, ranged up to challenged outside the leader turning for home while being floated
out a bit by that one entering the stretch, long drive, wore that rival down late while fully extended. HUNKA BURNING LOVE broke alertly, drew clear in the
first turn, continued to set the pace, responded when challenged by the winner while coming out a bit exiting the final bend, proved stubborn until late,
narrowly lasted for the place while between the next two at the wire. TAPAGE settled back off the pace, saved ground, displayed a mild amount of interest
through the stretch while remaining inside to earn part of the show. HARDLY A SECRET broke back, angled in first turn to save some ground, raced in the
two path into the far turn, steered out a bit to be three wide when advancing in the final turn, lost some ground to the top two into the stretch, steadily gaining
while widest through the stretch to earn a dead heat for the show. RIVER ECHO (GB) settled off the pace inside, continued to save ground into and through
the final bend, lacked a significant response through the lane. CASHANOVA fell bac after the start, raced inside, picked off some tiring rivals along the
inside with some belated interest. ARRIVAL in the second flight early, began to fade between horses midway on the final turn. RED AGAIN steered out to be
three wide in the second group in the first turn, continued outside, gave way in the drive. COAL TRUTH tired while also racing three wide most of the way.

Footnotes
TAISHAN settled off the pace and the inside, three wide second turn, asked along turning for home, long drive, engaged leader inside the furlong marker,
fully extended to be edging clear late. INDIMAAJ dueled up front off the inside, narrowly showed the way upper stretch, drifted out late while giving ground
grudgingly to the winner while remaining clear for the place. PRODIGIOUS BAY broke on top, alternated up front closest to the inside, weakened gradually
through the stretch while comfortably saving the show. EGO last away, trailed for six furlongs, steered out four wide in the second turn, improved position a
bit with some moderate late interest. DEFENDER broke back, raced in mid pack well off the inside, angled to the inside through the second turn, went
evenly through the stretch. WARRIOR'S MAP forwardly placed early, fell back, failed to menace. TILLIS stumbled at the start, moved out when moving
closer to be four wide late in the first turn, five wide into the far bend, gave way.

Footnotes
AMERICAN DUBAI pressed the early leader in the two path, continued to apply pressure up the backstretch, advanced then took over late in the final turn,
shook clear, kept to task in the run to the wire under firm handling. HOME RUN TRICK forwardly placed into the first turn, steadied midway through that
bend while along the rail, remained firmly in hand up the backstretch remaining inside, moved out, overtook the tiring early leader behind the winner turning
for home, no match for that one, held sway for the place. CHICORY BLUE rated behind the pace while saving ground, moved out and closer three wide
behind the top two turning for home, flattened out, finished up best of the rest. PEPPER PIKE last away, void of speed, moved closer in some traffic late in
the final turn, continued to display some mild interest down the lane to improve position a bit, not a threat to the top three. ZENUCCI four wide into the first
turn, continued off the pace, failed to rally. COLONEL TALBOT lacked speed, checked up from between rivals into the first turn while well back off the pace,
failed to muster a rally while remaining back. MAJOR BROWN settled in mid pack early, had nothing for the drive. TWO DOT away in good ordeer, showed
the way into the first turn, pulled through a quick set of early fractions, gave way when headed by the winner late in the final turn, continued to stop through
the lane.

SIR MICHAEL broke on top, set the pace up the backstretch while a bit washy, extended advantage into the stretch, continued to draw out to the wire under
steady handling. PULL MY CHAIN chased the winner off the inside in vain, proved no match in the drive, all out to hold the place. NEWS BOX off a step
slow, trailed well back for a half, swung four wide into the lane, rallied well out in the strip to be getting to the runner up. AMERICAIN JOEY back off the
pace, asked along in the turn, four wide into the lane, also displayed some late interest. PRAETORIAN lacked speed, improved position down the lane while
three wide, not a serious threat. SECRETARY AT WAR mid pack, had little left for the drive. WHENTHEDOVESCRY forwardly placed along the inside,
steadily faded. SMART TIME closer in the turn while three wide, gave way in the drive. CAPTURE THE GLORY rank while in some traffic soon after the
start, was finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
PRESSURE broke on top, dueled up front off the inside up the backstretch and into the turn, narrowly showed the way into the lane, slowly edged away past
the furlong marker, drifted late, held. SLIM MAN lacked early foot, came three wide out of the turn, rallied widest through the stretch and finished up willingly
to be second best. LIFE ON THE NILE forwardly placed while racing off the inside, three wide through the turn, lugged in repeatedly through the stretch
despite a left handed pressure, unable to contain the runner up late, lasted for the show. SWITZER in mid pack off the inside, in the second flight through
the turn, traffic into the stretch, displayed some late interest to close the gap on the show horse late. MINICONJOU back off the early pace toward the
inside, moved a bit closer in the two path midway on the turn, was going evenly in midstretch when bothered by LIFE ON THE NILE, continued in even
fashion when checked up a sixteenth out. MAXIMUM IMPACT lacked speed while saving ground, improved position through the stretch while not a serious
threat. MATTS FIRE N ICE dueled up front while closest to the rail and inside the winner, gave way steadily through the stretch. OFF THE CUFF bothered
at the break to be off slowly, remained always back. SCOTCH NO ROCKS fell back, three wide, failed to menace. G T THREE FIFTY in the second flight
well off the strip, four wide late in the turn, steady retreat down the lane. ISLAND MUSIC broke in, bothered rival to be slow away, trailed throughout.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF MINICONJOU AGAINST LIFE ON THE NILE FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
EDGE TO EDGE pressed the early leader off the inside, took over into the turn, clear into the stretch, expanded that advantage to the wire under token
encouragement to win ridden out. REPROBATE forwardly placed off the inside, three wide through the turn, could do little with the winner in the run to the
wire, clearly second best. NAME REJECTED void of early foot off the inside, three wide, staged a mild rally to finish up best of the rest while no match to the
top two. BANDIT POINT last away, trailed well back for a half, shifted out widest for the drive, found best stride too late in improving position.
WINDCRACKER in the second flight along the inside, had little for the drive. LAMUTANAATTY broke back and failed to menace off the inside. NAVY SEAL
settled in mid pack early, tried through the lane. MONEY MIKE broke sharp, flashed early foot along the inside, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
MARIAH'S PRINCESS away well, prompted the leader off the inside under confident handling, bid second turn, put a head in front turning for home, put the
early speed away soon after to be clear past the furlong marker, kept to task to the wire. AMENDMENT NINETEEN off slow after being a bit unprepared for
the break, used four wide to assume a forward position first turn, stalked three wide up the backstretch, wore down rival for the place, not a threat to the
winner. LOVELY RIDE broke sharp, cleared to the inside into the first turn, pace, offered brief resistance to the winner turning into the lane, caught for the
place, saved the show. WILLFUL WOMAN within striking distance toward the inside, two path second turn, lacked a closing punch in the drive. BOBBIN
TAIL in mid pack while racing three wide, evenly paced, asked along when the tempo picked up in the final turn, also failed to muster a closing response.
OLIVIAOFTHEDESERT in traffic first turn along the inside while strongly restrained, continued to save ground through the second turn, came up empty for
the drive. SUNNY ISLE BEACH broke back, failed to menace in remaining back. SEMBLE JUSTE (IRE) was also never involved in a dull effort.

Footnotes
GAR HOLE bothered slightly at the start, forwardly placed toward the inside early, in some traffic, brief wait late turn, hit a seam in full stride turning for
home, bit, surged clear. TOPF ROAD RULES broke alertly, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch, headed early in the turn, continued to vie into the
lane, proved no match for the winner when that one got clear in the stretch, proved game for the place. YOU VEE CEE pressed the runner up off the inside,
vied between rivals through the turn, also proved no match for the winner late, outkicked for the place while narrowly holding the show. FORSAKEN broke in
good order from the outside, vied up front three wide into and through the turn, not enough for the place after a protracted stretch drive. BIG SUCCESS
behind the pace outside early, ranged up closer four wide late in the turn, lost some ground into the lane and flattened out. TWISTED DIXIE went one paced
while angling out a bit four wide turning for home. TRAFFIC CONTROL in the second flight off the inside, had little for the drive. SERBIAN SAILOR
remained back in failing to threaten. BELLAMYS ROAN off a step slow, remained back in failing to threaten. MACHO APPEAL bothered, off slow, was never
involved. CYBER MONDAY was finished early while five wide late in the turn. CHIKI BOY showed little in trailing early most of the way.
