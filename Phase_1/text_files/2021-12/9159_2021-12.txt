Footnotes
NATIONWIDE PRIDE steadied in tight quarters along the first turn while tracking the pace, stalked the pace through the backstretch, improved position on
the second turn while three wide, pushed through to collar the tiring pacesetters inside of the final sixteenth and edged clear in the end. NORWESTER was
unhurried in the early stages, was two wide on the second turn while gaining ground and continued that run through the stretch to win the nod for second.
BRANNIGAN contested the pace through the second turn with LAKER BARRY, vied for the lead inside of the furlong marker and was outfinished in deep
stretch. SMILING MELANIE stalked the pace through the second turn while saving ground, was blocked behind foes nearing the furlong marker, tipped out
to the two path for the drive then slipped back inside, gained ground in mid stretch and just missed for third. SILENT BULLET was allowed to settle through
the backstretch run, was three wide on the second turn and while not challenging the leaders closed willingly in the stretch run. LAKER BARRY dueled with
BRANNIGAN for pace duties through the second turn, was caught inside of the eighth pole and weakened in the drive. COMMON CAUSE stalked the early
pace through the backstretch run, lost ground on the second turn while two wide and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
MANAALABOUTDAMONEY was sent leaving the start to set the pace, extended the lead leaving the turn and pulled away in the late going as much the
best. THISONESFORBARRY bumped HANDSOME HUSSAR leaving the start, tracked the pace from a two wide path on the turn, was no match for the
winner in the drive but bested the rest. PRINCE CINDERELLA tracked the early pace, was three wide on the turn and did not offer a late rally in the stretch
run, while holding for third. HANDSOME HUSSAR was bumped at the start and was away slowly, chased from the rear through the turn while three wide
and tired in the stretch run. TOMMY SPECIAL stalked the pace through the turn and faded in the late going. SONORA SERMON chased the pace from a
three wide position on the turn and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
LIZZY'S INTHEGAME was allowed to settle through the second turn, was asked for run nearing the quarter pole, made a sweeping six wide move to circle
the field into the stretch, caught BRITE TAN inside of the furlong marker and edged clear in the end. BRITE TAN stalked the pace while saving ground
through the second turn, vied for the lead inside of the furlong marker but was caught by the winner soon after and was outfinished, while holding on for
second. MIA SOLINA sat just off of the early pace while between foes on the first turn, continued to be in tight along the backstretch, was boxed in on the
second turn, took back for racing room into the stretch and closed well to just miss for second. RED DAHLIA was away in good order and set the pace
through the second turn, was confronted nearing the furlong marker and tired in the stretch run. SASSY EINSTEIN saved ground on the first turn while
unhurried, improved position on the second turn while five wide but did not continue that run and faltered in the late stages. PULPIT SINGER stumbled at
the start, was hustled to dispute the pace through the second turn and was empty in the drive. STARS OF BLUEGRASS stalked the pace through the
backstretch, gained ground while four wide on the second turn and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
SKY MAKER settled off of the early pace while two wide, swung to five wide for the drive, caught MI AMARE inside of the furlong marker and kicked clear in
the end. MI AMARE chased the pace through the early stages, gained ground on the turn to vie for the lead while four wide, led leaving the turn but was
caught by the winner inside of the eighth pole and bested the rest. BLUE WILDCAT tracked the early pace, gained ground to vie for the lead on the turn
while three wide between rivals, was still in aim leaving the turn and flattened out in the drive though held for the show. MAYDAYSMOON stalked the pace
from a three to four wide path, gained ground into the stretch and weakened in the late going. PLEASEPLEASEPLEASE had no speed in the early stages,
improved position while three wide on the turn and lacked a late rally. SHE'S NOT TO BLAME pressed the pace through the turn, was two wide between
foes while vying for the lead nearing the quarter-marker and weakened in the stretch run. CHELINA lacked early speed, was two wide on the turn and was
not a factor. BIG MAMA THORNTON was sent leaving the start to set the fractions while being pressured, continued to feel that challenge on the turn while
setting the pace and faded in the late going.

felt pressure in the late stages but held to prevail. DOUBLE THE GOLD was allowed to settle through the backstretch run, was three wide on the second
turn, gained ground through the stretch while on the left lead and closed well to pressure the winner but could not reel him in. BLUEBERRY EYES tracked
BROOKYS TAPIT through the second turn from a two wide position, lost a bit of ground into the stretch and was outfinished in the late going, while holding
for the show over oncoming rivals. SUMMANUS was four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace through the second turn, closed well in the stretch and just
missed for third. UNUSUAL CODE was unhurried in the early going, was two wide on the second turn and gained ground in the late stages to just miss for
third. RUNNING ON EMPTY was forwardly placed through the second turn while three wide, lost ground into the stretch and finished evenly in the stretch
run. LYING GHOST was a bit rank and hard to place on the first turn and steadied nearing the run into the backstretch, saved ground on the second turn
along the rail, was blocked nearing the furlong marker and lacked a late response. OCTAVIUS PRIME saved ground throughout while stalking the pace, lost
ground into the stretch and did not offer a late bid. AWESOME CURLIN was unhurried in the run through the backstretch, was two wide on the second turn
and was not a factor.

Footnotes
LOTSA PEPPER dueled on the front end with ALLIE'S PAL through the turn while carving out fast fractions, shook free of that foe nearing the furlong
marker, was kept to task through the lane and felt mild pressure in the end from the runner-up but held in a drive. MISS LADY ANN stalked the pace from a
two wide path on the turn, gained ground into the stretch and was closing on the winner in the late going but could not reel her in while besting the rest. THE
GREAT HAYNES saved ground while sitting off of the pace, improved position leaving the turn and closed willingly to claim the place. GO SMILEY GO
stalked the pace while traveling along the inside on the turn, gained ground off of the turn and finished evenly in the drive, just missing for third.
CHIEFTAIN'S LADY had no early speed, was three wide on the turn and was gaining ground in the stretch. TONI TWO POCKET tracked the pace from a
three wide path on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch run. ZAKKIYYAH had no early speed and did not have a late kick in the drive. CANAM GAL
saved ground while settling toward the rear of the field and did not offer a late rally. PHANTOM INDIAN chased the early pace, lost ground on the turn while
two wide and tired in the stretch run. ALLIE'S PAL was away alertly and dueled with LOTSA PEPPER for pace duties through the turn, lost ground off of the
turn and faded in the stretch run.

switched leads to catch the runner-up inside of the sixteenth marker and edged clear in the end. ISLA ROSE stalked the pace through the second turn,
improved position on the second turn while three wide to lead into the stretch run, was clear inside of the final furlong but was caught and outfinished by
NICOLE GRACE in the late stages while besting the rest. ALL MY HOPE was floated five wide on the first turn, then took back to settle off of the pace
through the backstretch run, was four to five wide on the second turn, was six wide in upper stretch, gained ground then steadied off of NICOLE GRACE
inside of the furlong marker and was outfinished in the late going. BOLD ARTICLE stalked the pace through the second turn and lacked a late response in
the stretch run. MAGICAL THOUGHT stalked the early pace, was four wide on the second turn and did not rally in the drive. STATEFOREST stalked the
pace through the backstretch run, improved position on the second turn while two wide and gave way in the stretch. SHANGHAI MIST was away in good
order and set quick fractions through the second turn, took up at the five-sixteenths marker while in tight quarters and faded in the late going.

Footnotes
AVENUE DE FRANCE (FR) settled just off of the early pace, saved ground through the backstretch run, was two wide behind the leading trio on the second
turn, was given her cue leaving the turn and made a strong rail run in the stretch to get by BROOKE and edged clear in the end. BROOKE (CHI) hopped at
the start and was hustled to attend to the pace through the backstretch run, was two wide on the second turn, got by SLOANE GARDEN inside of the
furlong marker and had a clear lead but was overtaken by the winner in the late stages, while besting the rest. SLOANE GARDEN (GB) was away in good
order and set the pace while being prompted, was under a snug hold through the backstretch run, led into the stretch but was caught by BROOKE nearing
the furlong marker and was outfinished in the late going. REIWA was unhurried in the early going, mounted a four wide bid on the second turn to gain
ground into the stretch but finished evenly in the drive. BLUE DIVA settled just off of the early pace, was three wide on the first turn, swung to five wide to
mount a bid on the second turn but could not muster a late rally in the stretch. TAPWATER was forwardly placed while stalking the pace through the second
turn and weakened in the stretch drive.THE FIRST QUARTER FRACTIONAL TIME WAS 25:37.

Footnotes
TOM'S SURPRISE settled just off of the early pace while two wide on the first turn, was three wide on the second turn, was asked for run nearing the
furlong marker, closed fast to collar SHOT OF A LIFETIME and kicked clear in the end. RESPECT THE HUSTLE saved ground through the backstretch run
while stalking the pace, was two wide on the second turn, mounted an inside rally in the stretch run and was outkicked by the winner while getting up in time
to claim the place. SHOT OF A LIFETIME was hustled to clear the field into the first turn and set the fractions through the second turn, led into the final
furlong but was quickly collared by TOM'S SURPRISE and was outfinished in the late going. ANITANEWMERCEDES attended to the pace from a two wide
path, lost position into the stretch and weakened in the late stages. ARCH PRINCE stalked the pace while three wide on the second turn and gave way in
the drive. MANILA MISCHIEF was allowed to settle in the early running, was five wide on the second turn and lacked a late rally in the stretch run.
LOAFERS BOY settled off of the early pace while saving ground on the first turn, was four wide on the second turn and lacked a late response. IZ
INVINCIBLE dwelt at the start, was away slowly, was hustled to not lose contact with the field but was not a factor.

Footnotes
PUSH THROUGH saved ground along the first turn while settling toward the rear, was three wide on the second turn, slipped to the inside for the drive,
gained ground, overtook MIKE OPERATOR inside of the furlong marker and drove clear in the end. FINAL FINAL was unhurried in the early stages, was
two to three wide on the second turn, swung to the six path for the drive and closed well in the stretch but could not reel in the winner while besting the rest.
LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) settled off of the early pace, gained ground while four wide on the second turn and closed willingly in the stretch to be a clear third.
CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS stalked the pace from the second flight, improved position on the second turn from a four wide path, vied for the lead at the
furlong marker but could not sustain that run and flattened in the late going. MIKE OPERATOR contested the pace through the second turn, vied for the lead
into the lane, was caught by the winner and weakened in the late stages. OUTRIGHT tracked the pace into the second turn, improved position from a three
wide path into the stretch but tired in the late going. HANDR'SDREAM contested the early pace with MIKE OPERATOR, was confronted nearing the
quarter-marker and faded in the stretch run. HANDSOME GARY was forwardly placed while stalking the pace through the second turn and gave out in the
stretch run. ECOLOGIST dwelt at the start and was away very slowly, spotted the field many lengths and did not have an impact.
