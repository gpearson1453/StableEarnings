Footnotes
VELVET NIGHT unhurried in the early part, moved up around the final turn, pulled away down the stretch and proved the best. PINTLALA raced within
striking distance in the beginning, took the lead around the second turn, couldn't match strides with the winner, down the lane, but was a clear second. MO
MONEYHONEY vied for the early lead, raced outside around the final turn, made a wide bid, proved third best at the wire. MERLIN'S SISTER lacked early
speed, improved position, but was no factor. THAT'S ALL RIGHT challenged on the front end in the beginning, took the lead down the backside and faded.
ABIGAIL G broke out, raced in the back and was never close. STORMY COLLISION brushed at the start, pressed the early pace, dropped back and was
eased to the wire.

Footnotes
GRACIDA lacked early speed, moved up on the outside around the final turn, dueled down the lane and prevailed for the win. ZENS SECRET raced in the
middle of the pack, dueled down the stretch, drifted out and was outfinished, while running a game third. NATE'S WAY vied for the early lead, saved ground
around the turn, dueled down the lane and was outfinished by the top two. KIERKEGAARD unhurried the beginning, raced between rivals around the
second turn, steadied down the stretch, getting in tight quarters and went to the wire evenly. REBEL RUMBLE raced in the middle of the field and put forth
an even effort. POPPI IS SMILING void of early speed and was never a factor. CROCODILE JACQUES dueled for the early advantage and faded. D'ROCK
flashed early speed and dropped back. THE JOCKEY OF #3 KIERKEGAARD LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #2 ZENS SECRET AND #5
GRACIDA FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE HEAD OF THE LANE. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS DISALLOWED THE CLAIM AGAINST #5 BUT
DISQUALIFIED #2 FROM 2ND AND PLACED HIM FOURTH.

Footnotes
DISIDE unhurried in the early part, moved up on the outside around the second turn, made a late bid, four wide and got up late. THE THIMBLE dueled on
the front end, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished for the win. RUNNER lacked early speed, moved up, within contention, made a wide gain
down the lane and got up for the show. MAJESTIC SOCIETY raced in the back in the early part, showed late interest and was outfinished for third.
GOTTATAKEHIMTO pressed the early pace, made a bid and faded. MICHAEL'S BAD BOY was an early factor and made a steady retreat. DOUBLE
PRIORITY challenged for the early lead and was finished early. RANGE OF MOTION raced within striking distance, had a wide trip and dropped back.
UNBRIDLED PULPIT always raced in the back and showed little.

HONORING MAJOR sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and won under strong urging. POST CLOSE pressed the pace, forwardly placed
throughout, couldn't catch the leader, but was a clear second. GENTRIFIED lacked early speed, moved up on the outside around the final turn, gained
ground and got up for third. BAJAN CASH raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, improved position, but was no factor. TWO MIKES N DOC G
unhurried, racing near the back, saved ground around the final turn and was never a factor. FOREVAMO pressed the early pace, saved ground around the
second turn and faded. KING OF THE TESTO showed early speed, came around the final turn wide and dropped back.
