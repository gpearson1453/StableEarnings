SHANE ZAIN stalked duo along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, prompted late on the turn, responded to urging and
surged strongly the final sixteenth along the rail to get up at the wire. NEAH BAY dueled along the inside along the backstretch, continued along the inside
on the turn, dug in gamely in the stretch and nailed in a game second at the wire. DEBT MONGER dueled 2wide throughout, briefly led in upper stretch,
outdueled late and finished up a game third. CONEJOS was settled along the inside exiting the chute, had to briefly steady and alter out at the seven
sixteenths, stayed on the two path throughout and failed to launch a rally. PROUDTOBESICILIAN stalked pace three wide on the backstretch, continued to
stay three wide on the turn and never threatened. SEA GLASS never threatened and trailed throughout.
