TOTAL MALICE stalked along the inside, bid inside of the leader at the furlong grounds, and drove clear. ZERO POINT ZERO stalked the clear leader two
wide while rating, but failed too keep pace with his inner tracking counterpart in upper stretch, then kept on to reach the tiring early pace setter for place late.
VALERIE VALESKI set a clear pace while staying a path off of the rail around the turn, got headed by an inner foe at the furlong grounds, weakened, and
lost place late. SISTER CHLOE trailed into the turn and improved inside of tiring foes through the lane without threatening. SLIDE failed to factor.
HOODWINK got outrun.

ITELLYOUTHEFACTS bumped with an outer rival soon after the start, cleared into the first turn, met BOULDERING's bid at the half mile pole, vied inside of
that rival around the far turn, but shook clear passing the three sixteenths pole, and was driven home to secure victory. CHIEF KIMOSABI broke slowly, sat
unhurried along the inside, saved ground, tipped two wide in upper stretch while inside of GUITARTUITION PLZZ, stayed on along with that foe through the
final furlong, and reached place between horses on the wire. BOULDERING broke inwardly and bumped a pair of foes at the start, stalked along the inside
into the first turn, gained three wide into the backstretch, moved to press the leader at the half mile pole, vied around the far turn, but was repelled in upper
stretch, tired through the final furlong, and got nailed on the wire for place. GUITARTUITION PLZZ settled off of the pace in the three to two path around the
first turn, came under a drive at the half mile pole, got floated three wide by an inner CHIEF KIMOSABI in upper stretch, stayed on along with that foe
through the final furlong, bid for place late, but missed via a photo finish. NORTHERNREFLECTION stalked along the inside before tipping outside of the
clear leader around the first turn, allowed an outer foe to make first run into the backstretch, then chased the leading pair around the far turn, and failed to
produce a bid before fading. MO CREDO laid off of the pace four to three wide and between horses around the first turn, but got rank among those rivals at
the eleven sixteenths pole, steadied and lost action entering the backstretch, then took the far turn three to four wide, and failed to factor. BASTI BLUE
tracked two wide, then along the inside around the far turn, but weakened in midstretch. FLASHBACK WIND was put to tight quarters between horses soon
after the start, took up when bumped on both sides, then never got involved. I LIKE DREAMING laid off of the pace five to four wide around the first turn,
advanced to track the pace into the backstretch, but tired into the far turn, and was done early. IKNOWIDIDN'TDOTHAT broke slowly before taking a bump
from an outer foe at the start, then got outrun.

Footnotes
SEEKING SAWYER broke outwardly, stalked three to two wide, then from between horses into the turn as VINTAGE VINYL moved alongside, got
outmoved by that foe at the five sixteenths pole, but picked up stride between horses approaching midstretch, ranged up to CYCLONE a sixteenth out, and
edged ahead while needing correction from lugging in. CYCLONE dueled for the lead outside of HOLY CITY, cleared that foe in upper stretch, but was
bested by an outer rallying foe passing the sixteenth pole. VINTAGE VINYL bumped with an inner foe shortly after the start, chased four to three wide,
gained turning for home to take aim on a clearing CYCLONE in upper stretch, but leveled off while getting outkicked by an inner foe for place at the furlong
grounds. HOLY CITY dueled for the lead inside of CLYCLONE, but gave way at the three sixteenths pole. MIZZEN MAN took bumps from rivals on either
side soon after the start, laid off of the pace in the three path around the turn, and chased evenly. B D VALESKI took a bump from an inner foe causing him
to brush an outer rival soon after the start, and never got involved. MR. CUNNINGHAM was forced outwardly and into an outer foe at the start, tracked from
the two path around the turn, and made little impact. STITCHED took a brush from an inner foe before tapping an outer rival at the start, then got outrun.
SEEKING HOME chased along the inside, but faded around the turn.

Footnotes
HOORAY AUSTIN tracked from the two to three path around the turn, tipped five wide entering the lane, rallied through midstretch, completed a bid inside
the final sixteenth as an outer RECLESS RANSOM did the same, forged an advantage between horses shortly after, and held. RECKLESS RANSOM raced
in midpack from the three to four path around the turn, altered course six wide and outside of HOORAY AUSTIN at the furlong grounds, rallied to bid in the
final sixteenth, but missed. SOUTHERN SWAGG set the pace along the inside, inched clear in upper stretch, but tired a sixteenth out as a pair of outer foes
closed in, and got reeled in approaching the wire. HALFMOON REEF saved ground at the rear around the turn, then improved inside of tiring foes in the
final furlong. PRIZELESS stalked four wide, chased through upper stretch, but weakened through the final furlong. MR. PRIORITY reared when attempting
to load and was briefly loose pre-race, stalked three wide and between horses, but only managed to chase through upper stretch before weakening at the
furlong grounds. C'MON VE stalked two wide, but faded through the lane. O'L RED chased the leaders four wide early on, but faded around the turn.

CITY PARK tracked along the inside, stalked behind the leaders while in the two path around the far turn, split foes two wide while bumping an inner tiring
JACI'S ROYALTY at the three sixteenths pole, rallied inside of leading pair in midstretch, and edged an advantage from PAYDAY too a sixteenth out.
PAYDAY TOO settled off of the pace two wide, tracked while inching closer in the three to four path turning for home, bid outside of MAGA MAN in upper
stretch, led at the three sixteenths pole, but was bested by an inner rival while flopping back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole. MAGA MAN bumped with
an inner foe at the start, stalked three wide, pressed around the far turn, bid turning for home, led briefly in upper stretch, but was outkicked at the three
sixteenths pole, and flattened out. IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT saved ground off of the pace, but was shuffled back behind a tiring STANDING MAN into the far
turn, shifted six wide in upper stretch while picking up stride, and chased through the final furlong for a minor share. POWER JET raced at the rear three
wide, swung seven wide entering the lane, but failed to menace. STANDING MAN bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked two wide and between
horses, but weakened into the far turn, and was done early. MR. FOUR SEVENS prompted the pace two wide, led between horses turning for home, but
weakened in upper stretch. JACI'S ROYALTY set the pace inside of a prompting MR. FOUR SEVENS, but yielded entering the lane, then got bumped by
the eventual winner while weakening approaching the final three-sixteenths. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING CITY PARK'S ACTIONS
IN UPPER STRETCH, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI RONNIE stalked as the closest pursuer to the run-off leader, narrowed that rival's advantage into the far turn, bid along with an inner
COMMANDER SCOTT at the five sixteenths pole, forged an advantage shortly after, then kicked clear at the furlong grounds. COMMANDER SCOTT
lunged outwardly into a rival at the start, tracked the pace, gained into the far turn to split the leading pair at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to reach
SHANGHAI RONNIE's throatlatch in the process, failed to keep pace with that foe at the furlong grounds, tired, but saved place. YOUR TIME'S COMING
settled far off of the pace along the inside, split foes two wide entering the lane, chased to bid for show inside of BAYOU JAM at the furlong pole, reached
that position entering the final sixteenth, but ran out of ground to catch a tiring COMMANDER SCOTT for place. BAYOU JAM trailed, improved four wide
and outside of foes around the far turn to reach show entering the lane, but was outkicked by an inner rival for that position a sixteenth from home. COACH
KENNY took a bump from an inner foe at the start, settled far off of the pace two wide, then three wide and between horses around the far turn, and failed to
make an impact. WE NEED A FIVE raced in midpack three wide around the first turn, then faded around the far turn. GUILTY LOVER saved ground in
midpack around the first turn, then faded around the far. WAR SAVVY was sent out of the gates, ran-off to a clear margin around the first turn, but was
overhauled by a pair of foes at the five sixteenths pole, and stopped through the lane.

Footnotes
FOUR DAWN set the pace two wide and between horses early on, cleared her inner counterpart at the half mile pole as her outer rival pressed on, but drew
away from that foe under confident handling turning for home, widened handily through upper stretch, and was geared down under wraps through the final
furlong. MY FRIEND AMY laid off of the pace in the four path around the turn, rallied entering the lane to reach place leaving the furlong grounds, and was
second best. GILLIAN ELIZABETH pressed the pace setter three to two wide, but proved no match for that foe at the five sixteenths pole, then lost place at
the furlong grounds. GIMME CANDY settled far off of the pace along the inside, came into the lane in the two path, but shied from an outer foe passing the
quarter pole, steadied due to the incident, then altered three wide at the three sixteenths pole, and moved up while shifting inwardly. PLEASE BE KIND
tracked three wide, but was outkicked by an outer foe for show entering the lane, and failed to factor. EILEEN GRAY vied along the inside for a furlong,
stalked passing the half mile pole, but chased along the rail entering the lane, and tired through the final furlong. RYAN'S GRACE tracked two wide and
between horses into the turn, but tired through the lane. SOULSTONE got outrun.

Footnotes
LONESHILOHSPECIAL rushed clear after a flat-footed beginning, met PALACE MAGIC's bid at the three furlong pole, dueled gamely with that foe through
the lane, and inched ahead in the final sixteenth. PALACE MAGIC stalked the clear leader from the outside, bid at the three furlong pole sparking a duel,
battled through the lane, but was repelled in the final sixteenth, then just lasted for place. PI YO PRINCESS saved ground off of the pace, rallied along the
rail through upper stretch, shifted outside of the dueling pair at the furlong grounds with multiple lengths to find, gained on them in the late stages, but
missed reaching place on the wire. SWEET BAY broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, raced far off of the pace three wide around the turn, swung
seven wide in upper stretch, and moved up late. MADISON JOY bobbled a bit at the start, laid off of the pace two wide around the turn, shifted six wide in
upper stretch, improved in midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer foe a sixteenth out, then kept on to reach a minor share on the wire. SUPERTRIX
chased along the inside, drifted to the three path in upper stretch, and failed to bid. VEILS AND VOWS tracked two wide, but got floated four wide in upper
stretch, and chased between horses. NOTREALLYNOTREALLY tracked three wide, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and faded. TALENTED TAPPER took
a solid bump from an inner foe at the start, and got outrun. SPECIAL SPOTS got caught four wide around the turn while off of the pace, and failed to factor.
LILLIE AND NAN broke a step slowly and never got involved.
