MATTS FIRE N ICE sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and was going away at the end. SMART ANALYSIS raced within striking distance,
came around both turns on the outside, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. THE BIG SHOW pressed the early pace, eased back,
came around the final turn on the inside, angled out, entered the stretch four wide, made a mild bid and was a clear third. COUNTRY CUT void of early
speed, improved position, but was no factor. PALIMONIUM raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. COTTONWOOD raced within contention
and faded. GENERAL EISENHOWER always raced near the back, came around the first turn on the outside and was outrun.

CONATIVE pressed the pace, drove clear down the home stretch and proved much the best. COCO'S MAN unhurried in the beginning, made a steady
gain, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. RELAX TOWN raced near the middle of the field, moved up, within contention and followed
the top two to the wire. QUANA DUDE raced in the back of the pack in the early part, showed late interest, but was no factor. CAPE TOWN WILLY raced in
the middle of the field, eased back, improved position, but was no threat. FLAT OUT LOVE void of early speed, had an outside trip and was never a threat.
PERFECT MISTAKE raced within contention, came around the second turn on the outside and faded. APRIORITY STORM lacked early speed, raced wide
around the final turn and showed little. PAT ME DOWN sprinted to the front and dropped back. THE FLUSH KING challenged for the early lead and
stopped.

Footnotes
STRUMMER vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, saved ground around the final turn, drove clear and finished well. JET SWEEP lacked
early speed, raced outside around the final turn, made a wide bid and got up for second. SUZIE'S DREAM raced near the middle of the pack in the
beginning, moved up, challenged the leaders and was outfinished for second. TECATE TIME steadied early, drifted in, racing in the rear, moved up within
contention and lacked a late kick. MISS CHARLIE SIOUX lacked early speed, came around the final turn wide and finished evenly. SCHIFF'S CORNER
dueled for the early advantage, steadied down the backside, getting in tight quarters in the rail and faded. SOUTHERN LIAISON raced near the middle of
the pack, faded and was never a factor. DUEFORADATE showed early speed and dropped back.

Footnotes
QUEETEN stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up around the final turn, pulled away and finished well. MIDNIGHT REVOLT raced within striking
distance, had an outside trip, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. NIPPY RED raced within contention, proved no match for the top two,
but got up for third. HUMPHREY pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout, weakened and was outfinished for show. ZIPZAPTIME sprinted to the
front, drove clear, saved ground around the final turn and faded. WHISKEY'S GONE raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. MR
MAKEITHAPPEN void of early speed and was never close. FAMILIAR RHYTHM lacked early speed and showed little. FROM NOW ON always raced near
the back and was outrun.
