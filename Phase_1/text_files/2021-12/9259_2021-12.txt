Footnotes
FUN PADDY, reserved between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out nearing the far turn gathering momentum, rallied three wide racing into upper
stretch, then took over and went clear under firm left handed encouragement. LUNA QUEEN, urged to the lead racing to the first turn dictating the pace just
off the rail to the backstretch, dueled inside a rival racing into the far turn, then past midstretch, couldn't match the winner but prevailed for the place honors.
PIONEEROF NEW YORK, in touch three deep prompting the pace racing to the backstretch, moved to press the issue after a half, dueled for command
outside a rival through the far turn past midstretch but weakened once headed by the winner. CROWN OF JOY settled last outside foes racing to the
backstretch and made some belated progress four wide in the stretch to close the gap. SUNDRENCHED switched out early tracking off the first flight in the
opening half but steadily faded into the far turn. MAMBO DANCER, pulling along the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, steadily
retreated after a half.

Footnotes
SWEET PENELOPE ducked out at the start, was quickly righted, then urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin into the turn, forged
clear racing through upper stretch and widened the advantage under firm right handed pressure. ADIOS DEE DEE shied avoiding the eventual winner at the
start bumping PHARAOH'S FASHION, was collected, then settled near the inside, steadily gained momentum racing into upper stretch, split foes three deep
nearing the sixteenth marked and edged a rival for the place honors. PEACELOVENKARMA was settled outside foes dropping out last on the backstretch,
angled four wide racing into the lane displaying some late interest and was just outkicked for second. CASANOVA QUEEN, urged along four wide in early
stages pursuing the leaders, continued three deep into the bend and gave way leaving midstretch. PHARAOH'S FASHION, bumped at the start, was quickly
righted, then urged prompting the pacesetter into the turn and gave way nearing midstretch. MONEY AND HONEY made brief pursuit of the pacesetter
three wide between foes in the opening quarter but was spent early.

Footnotes
CONGRATSROSY was prompted to a contending position three deep racing to the first turn, tracked the leaders in that path to the backstretch, advanced to
challenge between foes entering the far turn, gained the advantage, then steadily drew clear racing into the lane, widening the advantage late under
pressure. CRYSTAL ORB raced four wide just off the leaders into the first turn, was prompted to advance just outside the eventual winner after a half to bid
for command three wide into the far turn but couldn't match that rival in the drive while proving best of the others. JUST LIKE INDY, urged prompting a rival's
pace to the backstretch, took over after a half, then dueled for command inside on a narrow advantage racing into the far turn, continued to pursue the
winner into upper stretch but weakened late. DEESSE, reserved avoiding close quarters along the inside in the opening stages, angled out five wide nearing
the lane and continued to gain some position late while no real threat. MOMS LOVE, off slowly, switched out racing to the backstretch to make brief pursuit
of the leaders four wide racing into the far turn but soon emptied out. LADY MIDAS angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch
but faded early. TWISTED TREASURE, urged along the inside setting the pace on a narrow margin racing to the backstretch, emptied out early.

Footnotes
I SAY I PLAY was rated just off the leaders along the rail racing to the backstretch, conceded some position under patient handling saving ground on the
second bend, tipped out three wide racing through upper stretch to split foes and wrested the advantage under firm handling. VINTNER, reserved well off
the leaders in the opening stages, switched outside foes to race four wide entering the backstretch commencing an early advance, moved to wrest the
advantage outside a rival racing into the far turn, maintained a narrow advantage racing past midstretch but couldn't fend off the winner while just lasting for
second. HOLD THE SPICE, off slowly while being shuffled out of close quarters at the break, settled near the inside racing to the backstretch, angled out
five wide racing through the stretch and found his best stride in the closing stages to close the gap while just missing for second. OSPREY was rated
between foes in the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch but lacked the needed final bid. MYSTERY
BANK, urged to the lead while angling to the inside leaving the chute, set the pace along the inside to the far turn, dueled inside a rival into upper stretch
and weakened late. KING ANDRES, forwardly placed prompting the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, faded along the inside racing into the stretch. BIG
PERM, reserved off the second flight racing to the backstretch, offered no rally. KICK IT CHARLIE tracked the leaders three wide in second flight racing to
the backstretch but faded early.

Footnotes
PIONEER OF MEDINA broke readily to gain the advantage in the opening sixteenth, switched outside a rival racing into the first turn to prompt that foe's
pace entering the backstretch, took over approaching the far turn, then held sway on a comfortable margin to the end while being kept to brisk
encouragement. COMPLETE AGENDA broke inwards bumping GOLDEN WONDER, was collected to track off the second flight outside foes to the
backstretch, shifted three wide racing through the stretch and prevailed for the place honors late. THE THUNDERER was rated off the first flight outside a
rival racing to the backstretch, was prompted in pursuit of the leaders outside that foe through the far turn to upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid.
CAMINERO tracked off the first flight along the inside, saved ground on the far turn while being prompted to advance on the pacesetter nearing the lane but
flattened out leaving midstretch. QUANTUM THEORY was hustled to the lead while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, set the pace for a half and
emptied out abruptly approaching the far turn. GOLDEN WONDER, bumped at the start, dropped out early.

Footnotes
INDIAN BUZZ, urged to dispute the lead between foes in the opening sixteenth, angled to the inside racing into the first turn to set the pace on a narrow
margin just off the rail into the backstretch, dueled for command inside a rival racing into the far turn, then turned back that rival to regain a clear advantage
and held sway to the end under firm encouragement. STAGE DOOR, forwardly placed along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch,
switched out three wide racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance and proved best of the others while never gaining even terms with the
winner. MISTA DONZELLA was rated off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued
with a mild bid while gaining a share. SARASOTA BOY, forwardly placed three wide racing to the first turn, tracked just outside the pacesetter prompting
that rival on the backstretch, moved to press the issue entering the far turn but flattened out leaving midstretch. OVERPRAISE tracked the leaders inside
foes in second flight, saved ground on the far turn but had no closing bid. OUTSTANDING DEBT, off last, was settled off the second flight racing to the
backstretch and never gained contention. STRONG ENDING, unhurried three wide in second flight in early stages, shifted out four wide midway through the
backstretch and soon faded. DOHKO tracked just off the first flight racing four wide to the backstretch, was prompted to make some brief progress in that
path after a half but came up empty entering the far turn.

Footnotes
UNLEVERAGED was rated off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped out splitting rivals nearing the second bend, was
prompted to advance while shifting out three deep nearing upper stretch, then continued with a steady late response to wrest command and go clear under
firm handling. MARV'S MAGIC, off last, was settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced to contention while shifting
nearer the inside racing through the far turn, split foes just off the inside entering upper stretch and continued willingly to edge a rival for the place honors in
the closing stages. SAUCY DEREK raced three deep leaving the chute to track just off the leaders, continued outside a rival in second flight racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance outside a rival challenging for command entering the far turn, gained a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch
but weakened late when failing to match the winner. ROBINSON tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, was prompted to advance
three deep entering the far turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and had no final kick. VIGO settled between foes in the last flight racing to the
backstretch, swung out five wide entering the stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. GENERAL settled inside foes in the last flight in the
opening half, switched outside foes entering the far turn, was fanned six wide into the stretch and made no real impression. LION CHARMER tipped off the
inside leaving the chute while being urged to terms prompting a rival's pace in the opening half, took over from that foe nearing the second bend, dueled for
command inside a rival racing through the far turn and gave way midstretch. INITFORTHELOVE angled to the rail tracking just off the pacesetter racing to
the backstretch, was shuffled back avoiding that rival racing into the far turn and had no further response. DRAMATIZED, urged to the lead while angling to
the rail leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch and gave way abruptly once headed entering the far turn.

Footnotes
SPANISH SOUL, held up between foes dropping back off the second flight avoiding close quarters in the opening stages, switched outside foes while being
prompted to advance four wide racing through the turn, gained terms with the leaders midstretch, lugged inwards under pressure putting NANTUCKETER in
tight quarters in late stages but continued with solid momentum to prevail under pressure. LIL GREEN MACHINE tracked the pacesetter three deep in
second flight through the backstretch, advanced on that foe to bid for command between foes leaving the midway point of the turn, struck the front nearing
upper stretch, continued to dispute the issue between foes in close quarters racing past midstretch and prevailed for the place honors while failing to contain
the winner. NANTUCKETER tracked off the second flight outside foes in early stages, advanced on those rivals racing four wide through the turn to
challenge for command nearing upper stretch, was caught in tight quarters leaving midstretch, then was taken up avoiding the winner while being outkicked
for second. HEAVEN'S TALE tracked off the second flight while angling inwards a bit on the backstretch, steadily gained contention three wide between
foes on the turn, angled inside the leaders racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. ROYAL BIZ tracked off the second flight between foes
racing into the turn and continued evenly while gaining some position entering the stretch. TINKER'S PAL was rated inside foes racing to the turn, angled
out five wide nearing upper stretch but had no closing bid. DISTINCTIVE LAD, off slowly, raced wide into the turn and passed only tiring rivals. ALI OWNS
THE FIGHT, urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter as part of the second flight, emptied out early. KHOZANITO settled outside foes racing to the
turn and proved no threat. EL GUAPO was hustled up the rail setting the pace on a clear margin racing into the turn but gave out abruptly nearing upper
stretch. EXCELLENT MARK was brief factor between foes tracking the leaders in second flight but soon gave way. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN LATE STRETCH BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
ANGELUS DIAMOND broke readily to gain the advantage inside a rival leaving the chute, dictated the pace a bit off the rail racing into the backstretch,
turned back a rival's challenge nearing upper stretch and kicked away through the lane under steady pressure. HAD RIGHT was prompted to a forward
placing from the outset while angling to the rail tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight, saved ground through the far turn and proved best of the
others in the drive. AEROBALLISTIC, urged to a position three deep tracking the pacesetter in second flight racing to the backstretch, advanced in that path
to briefly challenge the pacesetter on the far turn but flattened out in the drive. PLAYING GOLD tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening half,
shifted inwards while being urged to advance nearing the lane and continued evenly between foes late. RACHEL DREAM was settled outside foes in the
last flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while angling to the inside racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to improve
position. GREAT JUNIOR tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out three deep nearing the lane but offered no rally.
FERGUS, reserved inside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, failed to menace thereafter. BOWSTRING BOY tracked off the second flight along
the inside but emptied out after a half. IOWA CLASS settled between foes in the last flight and proved no threat. HOOT GIBSON was urged pursuing the
pacesetter into the backstretch and gave way abruptly after a half.
