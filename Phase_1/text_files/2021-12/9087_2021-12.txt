raced off the rail and weakened late. DANCINSTARDUSTLADY was unhurried early, went four wide into the turn, angled in and offered no late rally.
CAUGHT STEALING was outrun early, advanced ten wide into the turn and never fired. QUESTA was taken back early, ranged up nine wide into the turn
and finished belatedly. DANI'S CAT raced in mid pack early, went seven wide and faded. CAYCEE'S MARK was reserved early, went seven wide into the
turn and flattened out. BOSSY BABY was up close early, raced along the inside and gave way. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL T was void of speed and was no
