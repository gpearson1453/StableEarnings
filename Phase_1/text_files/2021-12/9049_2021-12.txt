Footnotes
SWAMP'N AIN'T EZ sped clear to establish the front, led two wide into the turn, showed the way four wide into the lane, drew away in upper stretch then
shortened a bit late but was able to hold. SOMETIMES ALWAYS broke a bit slow, sat off the pace, took the turn three then four wide, angled out at the top
of the stretch, closed fast but was too late. SHARP WARNING away quickly from inside, chased along the inside then eased out to the four path around the
turn, moved in some in the lane and bested the rest. MONTANA MOON raced between foes and got shuffled back when crowded early, took the turn four
then three wide and improved position. CAPTAIN N. BARRON raced up close outside the pacesetter into the turn, chased five wide into the lane and
weakened down the stretch. MALAKAI MOXIE chased three wide into the turn, five wide into the stretch and lacked further response. INTENSE off a bit
slow to begin, lacked early speed and angled inside, saved ground to the stretch and failed to menace. STREET BEHAVIOR chased between foes, four
wide into the turn, six wide into the lane and weakened. SURPRISE FASHION chased the speed outside rivals, went three deep into the turn, seven wide
into the lane and was not a factor. HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
STARSHIP CHEWBACCA stalked off the rail, entered the stretch four wide, brushed with ACTIVE ACCOUNT at the quarter pole, rallied between late and
proved best. ACTIVE ACCOUNT tracked the pace outside a rival, navigated the turn four then five wide, brushed with rival at the quarter pole, rallied in
tandem with STARSHIP CHEWBACCA but was outkicked by that rival. REBEL WAR sped to the front from inside, padded the lead from off the rail, led
three wide into the stretch, held a diminishing lead with a sixteenth to go and yielded to the top pair. PERFECT WAGER came away slow, settled off the
pace, went two wide into the bend, angled five into the stretch, put in a late bid but needed more in the final sixteenth. BARBIERE tracked the pace four
wide into the turn, eased out to the six path around the bend and failed to rally. INDY JONES forwardly placed from inside up the backstretch, lost ground
around the turn, kept inside to the stretch and weakened. GOV FROM ABOVE tracked widest up the backstretch, went five wide into the turn, exited the
bend seven wide, angled inward in the stretch and weakened. HAND-TIMED.

HALF RIGHT brushed leaving the gate, traveled up close outside the leader, pressed briefly into the turn before losing contact with the pacesetter, chased
three wide into the lane, bid between in upper stretch, kicked clear from rivals and held safely. DEFENSE WINS brushed leaving the gate, was forwardly
placed outside a rival, was driven four wide into the lane, bid three deep in upper stretch but proved no match for the winner in the late stages. RED VALOR
was off a step slow to start then was hustled to the front, cleared around the turn, showed the way two wide into the stretch, ceded command past the
quarter pole and weakened to third. OWNING raced well off the rail then angled to the two path, shifted to the rail around the bend and came up empty in
the drive. PLATINUM EQUITY became rank early then dropped back, took the turn four then five wide and was not a factor.

PYEONG CHANG sped clear from inside, led two wide wide into the turn, eased out and showed the way four wide into the stretch, met the challenge from
LEMON DROP SHOT at the quarter pole, repelled that bid and drew off in the final furlong. LEMON DROP SHOT stalked the pace outside a rival, loomed
five wide exiting the turn, bid outside at the quarter pole but was turned away by the winner and stayed on to secure the place. NEW SOI PHET tracked two
wide into the turn, three wide into the lane and was along for the show, then walked into the van under his own power following the race. CATFISH
CHARLIE coaxed from the gate, chased two then three wide around the turn and got edged for the show. FINDING SILVER chased outside a rival well off
the rail up the backstretch, went four then five wide around the turn and weakened. PAPA PRIMITIVO broke slow and lost his path at the start, came four
wide into the stretch and was never a factor.

FRANKLIN ONE STAR chased outside rivals up the backstretch, launched a bid from outside on the turn, dueled down the lane and put a head in front
inside the eighth pole and dug in late to prevail. MOB BOSS sped to the front from inside, was tested by FRANKLIN ONE STAR around the bend, dueled
inside that rival through the stretch, relinquished the lead past the eighth pole but stayed on gamely to the wire. STREET HUMOR was forwardly placed
inside a pair of rivals early on, angled off the rail and chased three wide into the drive, dove back to the inside in upper stretch and finished willingly for a
clear third. AGADOR SPARTACUS broke in and bumped rival at the start, raced along the inside then a bit off the rail leaving the bend and improved
position. BIG IMPACT chased between foes then outside a rival on the turn, exited the bend four wide and lacked further response. DARK MARCUS
tracked widest up the backstretch, navigated the turn four to five wide failed to threaten. OUBABE stumbled badly and got bumped from outside leaving the

Footnotes
SIR FLATTER broke in and bumped rival at the start, tracked outside a rival then two wide into the turn, angled to the rail on the bend, rallied from inside in
deep stretch and wore down the runner-up. GRANDCONCOURSE GUY stumbled at the start but still came away quickly, sped clear to take control, led two
then three wide around the turn, remained clear into the furlong grounds, met the challenge from SIR FLATTER in the late stages but was edged in the
closing moments. BIG WELL bumped by the winner at the start, sat off the pace early on, spun three wide into the stretch, moved out and rallied to best the
rest. THE BOSS HARTY chased the pace outside a rival, cleared inside and moved and moved to the rail, exited the bend two wide and lacked the needed
rally. QUANTUM QUEST was closest in pursuit outside the leader up the backstretch, took aim four wide entering the stretch but weakened down the lane.
EIGHT MAKAR coaxed early from inside, lost ground into the turn, remained inside to the stretch and weakened. CARDOZA off slow to begin, went two
then three wide around the turn and was not a factor. DADDYS SPECIALDARK sat off the pace early on, traveled four wide into the turn, exited five wide
and failed to make an impact. CARELESS KITTEN settled in the early going, went three wide into the turn, angled out to the five path and weakened.
