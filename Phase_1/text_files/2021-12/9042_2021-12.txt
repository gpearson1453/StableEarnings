Footnotes
CLUB SODA cleared off early on, managed a clear lead while in the two path around the turn, widened that margin in upper stretch, then tired in the closing
stages as DICK THE BRUISER gave chase, but lasted safely to the wire. DICK THE BRUISER took the turn in the two to three path while off of the pace,
tipped three wide entering the lane, rallied in midstretch to take aim on the clear leader, and cut into that foe's margin through the closing stages, but was
only second beset. HOLY SPIRIT tracked from midpack along the inside, stayed a path off of the inner railing around the turn, got outkicked for a minor
placing in midstretch, then stayed on through the final furlong to reach show. W W KAN DO chased along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the leader
in upper stretch, and faded. SR. CLARKY trailed and never got involved. WILL KNOWS laid off of the pace four wide around the turn, and tired. SET HUT
chased outside of the clear leader while in the three path, but weakened into the turn.

Footnotes
MS SATCH MO broke in and caused multiple rivals to be stacked up at the start, tracked from midpack two wide, gained three wide turning for home, took
aim on a clear SWANAGE in upper stretch while rallying inside of PAYTONSATTHEPLATE, bid along with that foe passing the furlong grounds, dueled
thereafter, but came out and bumped her counterpart at the sixteenth pole, and gamely prevailed in the battle. PAYTONSATTHEPLATE replaced far off of
the pace in the three to two paths around the turns, shifted four wide entering the lane while commencing a rally, bid for the lead outside of and along with
MS SATCH MO passing the furlong marker, dueled with that foe through the late stages, but was bumped by that rival a sixteenth from home, and was
denied. SWANAGE set the pace along the inside, shook clear in upper stretch, but met a pair of bids from multiple paths away crossing the furlong grounds,
and faltered through the late stages. GOTTABEGOLDEN took the worst of the scrapping among rivals at the start and took back from tight quarters between
horses, trailed the field, took the far turn three wide, shifted six wide approaching midstretch, and improved. KATIE'S KARAT broke outwardly and bumped a
rival into others at the start, pressed the pace two wide, but chased the leader from between horses in upper stretch before fading through the final furlong.
EARNESTINE N HAZEL (IRE) was bumped between horses at the start, shifted outwardly early on and settled off of the pace three wide, then saved
ground around the far turn before tipping three wide approaching midstretch, but failed to factor. EPHEMERAL took bumps from rivals on either side at the
start, then stalked comfortably along the inside, but faded in upper stretch. STACEYS RACEY stalked the pace three to two wide, but weakened between
horses turning for home. CALIFORNIA KATIE also bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, settled off of the pace in the two path, but was done early,
and eased through the lane. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, AS WELL AS A RIDER'S OBJECTION OF PAYTONSATTHEPLATE AGAINST MS
SATCH MO FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, MS SATCH MO WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND

COMMERCIAL FLASH stalked four wide before tucking to the rail into the turn, tracked the dueling pair around the turn, tipped outside of them to take aim
in upper stretch, ranged up passing the furlong grounds, and edged an advantage in the closing stages. RONNIE'S PESO dueled for the lead two wide,
battled through upper stretch, but flopped back to his left lead as COMMERCIAL FLASH ranged up passing the furlong pole, recovered shortly afterwards,
but was bested by that rival. CRYPTO BRAVE dueled for the lead along the inside of RONNIE'S PESO, gamely sustained the battle into the final furlong as
the eventual winner bid as well, but gave way to those foes in the late stages. SLIDE settled off of the pace along the inside, came into the lane in the four
path, and stayed on for a minor share. SISTER CHLOE trailed after being slow into stride, and failed to factor. APHRODITES REVENGE chased the dueling
pair three wide around the turn, but drifted outwardly entering the lane, and weakened.

split foes two wide in upper stretch, but altered outside of the outer rival at the three sixteenths pole, grinded away to bid in the closing stages, surged late,
and got up on the wire. HOGSLAYERS R I P hopped at start and was off slowly, stalked two wide, vied between horses around the far turn, shook clear in
upper stretch, dug in inside the final furlong as MO Z menaced, but got nailed on the wire. VERSTAPPEN set the pace along the inside with his ears pricked
down the backstretch, but met a pair of bids around the far turn, was headed by those rivals turning for home, fought on through upper stretch, but was
unable to produce a re-bid before yielding a sixteenth from home. AFTERNOON ANEJO settled at the rear three wide, moved up to a stalking position into
the far turn, but was floated five wide approaching midstretch, and chased the leading trio home. MR. CUNNINGHAM brkoe inwardly and bumped a rival
into another foe at the start, tracked the pace three wide, moved forward to vie for the lead around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with an inner
counterpart in upper stretch, and faltered at the furlong grounds. KING TUFF was jostled between horses at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside,
but was outrun. MATTHEWSTHIRTYFOUR was bounced around among rivals at the start, got rank between horses while off of the pace early on, remained
unsettled while pulling to a tracking position into the backstretch, then tired turning for home.

Footnotes
REDOUX pressed the pace three wide around the first turn, moved up to vie outside of MISTER STRANGE passing the three quarter pole, cleared that rival
with five sixteenths to go, then drew off through the lane under driving pressure. MISTER STRANGE vied two wide around the first turn, cleared an inner foe
while meeting REDOUX's challenge down the backstretch, but proved no match turning for home, tired through the lane, but lasted for place. TROPHY
DADDY settled off of the pace in the two path, swung five wide entering the lane, and moved up for a minor share. MY GUITAR was sent at the start to vie
for the lead along the inside, but allowed an outer rival to go on into the backstretch, stalked, but chased around the far turn before fading turning for home.
KYLE'S BRO JIMMY tracked three wide, chased the leading pair around the far turn, but weakened thereafter. TIN DELAY lagged well behind the field,
shifted five to six wide in upper stretch, and failed to menace. MOM SAID YES laid off of the pace in the three to four paths around the turns, came into the
lane four wide, and failed to factor. LUCKY STREAKER stalked two wide, then from between horses down the backstretch, but faded at the half mile pole,
and was done early.

Footnotes
PESO IN MY POCKET set the pace along the inside, drew off passing the quarter pole, widened under driving pressure, and was kept to task to the wire.
TRICOLOUR laid off of the pace, gained three wide turning for home, the stayed on to reach place on the wire. WHISKEY GENT stalked along the inside,
but failed to keep pace with the clear leader in upper stretch, claimed place approaching the furlong grounds while proving no match, then got nailed on the
wire for that position. FIGHTVILLE pressed the pace two wide, but faded entering the lane. WEBCAM broke a step slowly, trailed the field around the turn,
shifted four wide entering the lane, and passed a pair of tiring rivals. DR. BENNY bumped with an outer rival at the start, then tracked along the inside, but
faded around the turn. MUCHO VELOCE hopped slightly before being bumped by an inner foe at the start, tracked two wide from midpack, but weakened
turning for home.

Footnotes
HANA ROAD tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, tipped three wide into the far turn, gained turning for home to claim place entering the
lane, took aim on a clear LA GIOIOISA (FR) in upper stretch, chased before quickening passing the furlong ground, swiftly drove past that foe at the
sixteenth pole, and drew clear. LA GIOIOSA (FR) stalked three wide, produced an early bid down the backstretch, cleared inner foes approaching the five
sixteenths pole, maintained a clear margin into the final furlong as HANA ROAD menaced, but drifted outwardly while meeting that foe's bid approaching the
sixteenth pole, but proved no match for that rival passing it. FROSTY DIPLOMACY was pinched back from tight quarters soon after the start, trailed the field
early on, tracked before splitting foes three wide entering the lane, chased the leading pair into midstretch, but lugged inwardly a bit while flopping back to
his left lead inside the final furlong, and leveled off. SUMMER MATE was taken back early on to settle off of the pace along the inside, trailed around the far
turn before swinging four wide in upper stretch, then stayed on, and claimed a minor placing from an outer rival while shifting inwardly through the final
furlong. LADY BRIELLE laid off of the pace three wide, chased five wide through upper stretch, but failed to menace. BUONGIORNO BEE stalked along the
inside, but faded at the five sixteenths pole. CAJUN KID required a shoe repair pre-race, pressed the pace two wide, vied between horses at the half mile
pole, but faded at the three furlong marker. PARKER EVA set the pace along the inside, met a pair of bids approaching the half mile pole, got headed into
the far turn, and weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
SUMITUP set the pace along the inside, drew off in upper stretch, and was driven home to seal the deal. ELSIE GIRL stalked two wide, but failed to keep
pace with the leader in upper stretch while securing place, and was second best. SUMMER IS HOT chased between horses early on, but failed to keep
pace before tucking to the two path into the turn, sustained chasing position before tipping four wide in upper stretch, then claimed show at the sixteenth
pole, and held it from inner foes. SHELLI'S ANGEL broke outwardly, settled off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide entering the lane, and improved
between horses late to miss reaching an outer foe for show. DELTA TRAVELER tracked along the inside, chased along the rail through midstretch, but
failed to bid before tiring and losing show at the sixteenth pole. LUCKY LINDA saved ground off of the pace, shifted two wide entering the lane, and stayed
on between horses. LONESHILOHSPECIAL hesitated at the start and broke inwardly, then saved ground at the rear, and failed to factor.
FUNKYLITTLESHACK broke a step slowly but recovered to stalk the pace four to three wide, inched closer to take aim on the leader turning for home, but
faltered on his left lead after being outkicked by her inner entrymate entering the lane. SPECIAL SPOTS broke slowly, got caught three wide while far off of
the pace, and never got involved. COSMIC BELLE was off slowly and got outrun.
