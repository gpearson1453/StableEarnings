Footnotes
SNOW MAN stalked the early pace while three wide into the turn, rallied and drew off in mid stretch and was kept to task in the end. SPECTACTICAL was
chasing the pace while inside and shuffled back on the turn, angled out to be three wide in upper stretch and was gaining ground but was second best in the
end. MAJOR SHIPMAN set a pressured pace while inside, was in a long drive then gave way in late stretch. MORO CHARLIE was inside then shuffled back
on the turn, moved out to be four wide for the stretch drive but was no menace. WEST COAST BROKER was two wide on the turn then made a bid five
wide in upper stretch and was no threat in late stretch. RANCHO BARGO raced four wide on the turn and trailed.
