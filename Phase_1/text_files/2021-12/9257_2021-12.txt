Footnotes
HEARTNESS controlled the pace and widened throughout and was placed under wraps late. ICE BAR broke slowly, advanced into the far turn, proved no
match for the winner but was easily second best. MONOGRAM saved ground within striking range and weakened. MERGING TRAFFIC pursued the winner
outside and proved empty in the stretch. SPEEDY ZEPHYR chased three wide and lacked a response. DOWNTOWN CRUMLIN raced very wide
throughout and gave way readily. RENEE'S Z VA saved ground off the pace and stopped abruptly.

COBH pursued the loose leader, led into the stretch and lasted following a long drive. HIZAAM trailed for half a mile, moved wide in the stretch and closed
strongly too late. JUMP SHOT chased four wide down the backstretch, bid on the turn and finished willingly. LOVERBOY LOU settled far behind then
finished with good energy. HERE WEGO saved ground off the pace then flattened out in the stretch. FRIED RICE KING outrun early, moved very wide on
the turn and lacked a rally. MY TRAIN rallied closer outside on the turn then came up empty in the stretch. FED FEVER lacked speed outside and was
never in contention. CHAMPERS flashed speed along the inside and gave way. ROCKIN COWBOY stumbled at the start, recovered to set the pace and

Footnotes
LADY VALENTINE pursued the pacesetter outside, took over at the eighth pole and edged away while kept to her task. NYSSA quickly took control inside,
was collared into the stretch and held on gamely. MOONCHILD chased wide throughout and continued well to the finish. SUPER DUPER FLY settled off the
pace inside, advanced on the turn and finished willingly. XENATOWN saved ground throughout, moved briefly closer into the stretch then flattened out.
EIGHT DANZAS eased back outside early and lacked a rally. NO SYMPATHY broke sluggishly and was always outrun. SUZY Q THE QUEEN broke very
slowly and trailed losing contact with her field.

Footnotes
MR SANDMAN bid to the front on the turn, was challenged again in the stretch, repelled that rival and drew away driving. SECRET ALLIANCE raced close
up, collared the leader into the stretch, steadied lugging in and was outfinished. NOBLE GASTON forced the pace inside to the quarter pole and weakened
in the stretch. COLD WALKER outrun early, rallied wide in the stretch with late energy. SCARAMOUCHE moved closer inside on the turn then faded in the
stretch. MR. AGALLAS dropped far behind then passed rivals without menacing. HOTPOT dropped back early and was never a factor. NATAVALLI'S
KNIGHT chased wide down the backstretch and faltered. MYQUIST lagged far behind then made up ground while no threat. MAGICAL KNIGHT raced very
wide and gave way readily. FLACO EXPLOSIVO hustled to the front inside to the far turn and stopped. A claim of foul by the runner-up against the winner
for interference in the stretch was dismissed.
