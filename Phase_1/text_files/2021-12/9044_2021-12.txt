Footnotes
CASHIER CHECK set the pace along the rail, kicked clear around the turn then drew off through the lane while drifting out a bit under intermittent
right-handed urging. BEASTFROMTHEEAST stalked the pace three wide down the backstretch, chased the winner in the clear two wide around the turn
and was clearly second best in the lane. MR MAC QUHAE chased the pace four wide down the backstretch, advanced three wide around the turn and
lacked the needed rally while holding third. TAPATERM was off slow, saved ground off the pace and passed tiring rivals. REGIO chased the pace two wide
and came up empty in the lane. DR CHROME failed to menace while racing two wide. CUPID'S GHOST was brushed at the start, prompted the pace two
wide and was through after a half. ECCENTRICO bobbled at the break, raced three wide and never threatened. TEMPESTUOUS brushed with CUPID'S
GHOST at the start then had brief speed three wide. UNTWISTED played no factor while racing two wide. DAVID'S CUPID was outrun inside.

Footnotes
ADVENTURE SEEKER set the pace inside, shook off pursuers around the turn, and widened through the stretch under a steady drive. GOLD SPECIAL
broke a step slow and was outrun early inside, moved out to the four-path approaching the top of the stretch, and finished willingly while not a threat to the
winner. RUSSIAN TO WIN was a step slow to begin, saved ground chasing the leading trio to the turn, stayed inside for the drive and lacked a solid rally.
GILLIGAN raced four wide and failed to menace. BACKATYA pressed the early pace between horses, could not stay with ADVENTURE SEEKER after a
half-mile, and tired. ORIENTAL PARK bumped lightly with LAKI LIO after the start, and never got close. ONWARD AUSTIN bumped with LAKI LIO after the
start, was outrun to the turn three wide, moved in on the turn and remained well in arrears. LAKI LIO bumped with ONWARD AUSTIN after the start, chased
early three wide outside the leaders, and was finished after a half.

Footnotes
BELLA SOFI raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid between horses approaching the three eighths pole, entered the
stretch in the two path and gained ground on the outside down the lane to get up in time. MAMA LONGLEGS dueled for the lead on the outside in the early
going, took over to lead outright headed into the turn, saved ground from there, continued to battle down the stretch and was caught late. BONNIE'S THE
BEST brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, trailed the field on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the
three and four path, swung wider still entering the stretch and gained ground on the outside from there. PRINCESS TERESKA brushed with the horse to her
outside leaving the gate, recovered to race in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, moved up to challenge the leader from the two
path around the turn, dueled in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final strides. DRILLZILLA raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the
opening stages, began a mild outside bid nearing the three eighths pole, entered the stretch in the three path and weakened in the final furlong.
ADVANCED TECHNOLOG raced off the pace on the inside early, came around the turn in the two path and made no bid from the rail. SASSY MELLY
dueled for the lead on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and continued to tire from
there.

Footnotes
FULL OF ATTITUDE was off a bit slow, advanced four wide around the first turn, bid two wide between foes around the far turn, dueled inside of
ACACIAHELPME through the lane, lightly brushed with that foe in deep stretch and dug in to prevail. ACACIAHELPME settled off the early pace three wide,
advanced between foes down the backstretch, took the lead three wide between foes nearing the quarter pole, battled on outside of the winner through the
lane, lightly brushed with that foe in deep stretch and just missed. NANA FANNY was bumped soon after the start, raced in range two and three wide,
angled five wide in upper stretch and rallied widest. VINTAGE GIRL was bumped after the start, rated off the pace two wide early, made a four wide middle
move, reached near even terms approaching the quarter pole but failed to sustain the bid in the lane. CLEVER KITTEN prompted the pace two wide, took
the lead and angled in nearing the far turn, vied inside to upper stretch then tired. GOSSIPING was bumped after the start, saved ground off the pace and
never threatened. PENNY ANGEL set the pace along the rail and retreated around the far turn. NADINE'S GIRL trailed inside.

ROMARIO was outsprinted for three furlongs, shifted to the far outside turning for home, rallied steadily and was up in the closing strides. THE VIRGINIAN
was forwardly placed three wide from the outset, rallied to the lead outside UNPRECEDENTED leaving the furlong grounds, but could not withstand the
winner. CITRUS BURST raced between horses in midpack to the turn, loomed in the two-path through midstretch, and finished willingly inside the top two.
UNPRECEDENTED sprinted clear early, showed the way in the two-path to the stretch, then gave way through the last eighth of a mile. TILTED TOWERS
saved ground in pursuit of the early pacesetters, bid along the rail through midstretch, and was outfinished. GHOUL (BRZ) raced three wide, and lacked the
needed bid. CITY DRIFTER saved ground to no avail. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE. RUNNING TIMES UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
DAY'S HUMOR set the pace in the two path, went clear rounding the turn, widened leaving the eighth pole, was taken firmly in hand with about seventy
yards to go as the rider appeared to mistake the alternate dirt finish line as the end of the race and held safe. EMIRATES AFFAIR chased the winner in the
three path, could not gain on that foe to deep stretch then belatedly closed the gap as that foe was taken in hand. MISS MAMBA was bumped at the start,
raced off the pace two wide, angled out in upper stretch and rallied through the lane. TIDAL WATERS was bumped at the start then again a few strides
later, chased the pace two wide and was one-paced through the lane. ADELE KAT saved ground to no avail. GREGS POSSE was bumped at the start,
saved ground in range and weakened in the drive. DON'T LOSE HOPE came in and bumped TIDAL WATERS soon after the start, had some speed four
wide and faded.

Footnotes
STUNNING PRINCESS saved ground in easy striking range early, shifted out three wide getting roused coming off the far turn, rallied determinedly and
overhauled TRAFFIC SONG from outside late. TRAFFIC SONG bumped with PANOTTI at the break, took control soon after that, rated along inside clear to
midstretch, drifted out past the sixteenth-pole under left-hand pressure and could not hold on. TIK TOK FAMOUS (GB) prompted the pace outside TRAFFIC
SONG to the stretch, and had no final bid. CAROLINE'S STORY lagged far back for six furlongs, moved out widest through upper stretch and was going
well belatedly. ALPHA ZULU was outrun early three wide, and remained out of contention to the stretch before passing tired horses. CULTURED was a step
slow at the start, went four wide on the first turn, moved inward to the far turn and failed to threaten in an even effort. DIAMOND PLAY was no factor inside.
SHORT CIRCUIT saved ground early, went four wide on the far turn, and made no impact. PANOTTI was bumped between horses at the start, and never
factored. FOLLOW THE FLAG bumped with PANOTTI at the start, and was outrun two to three wide. YOLANDA'S PRIDE bumped with ENDLESS FRONT
and checked back first time through the stretch, moved inward to the two-path under a firm hold to the first turn, stayed in range to the stretch and came up
empty. ENDLESS FRONT got bumped by YOLANDA'S PRIDE early, raced forwardly three wide for six furlongs, and had nothing left. RUNUP
UNAVAILABLE. FRACTIONS AND FINAL TIMES UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION. EQUIBASE HAND TIME FROM GATE: 1:35.72.

ANNA'S DREAM brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn, kicked clear in the stretch and held her margin to the wire while drifting out late. TWENTY ONE SHORT tracked the leaders on the inside
through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, drifted out significantly down the lane while chasing the eventual winner home and was
the best of the rest. CAJUN COUSIN raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, and improved position
between horses in late stretch while never threating the top two. BLAME IT ON ROSE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going,
began a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole and was outkicked in the stretch. NUMERIC hopped up slightly leaving the gate, raced off the
pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path and finished evenly. LARA'S LADY bumped with the horse
to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead on the outside while racing up the backstretch, took over a slight lead while racing in the two
path around the turn, drifted out to the five path entering the stretch and faded from there. DEL REY DOLLY trailed the field on the outside up the
backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and offered no bid. VANISHING FAITH was away from the gate slowly, shuffled back to race off the
pace between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and was never a factor.

Footnotes
RED DANGER settled off the pace while racing two wide, edged closer two wide around the far turn, angled four wide near the quarter pole, bid between
foes nearing the eighth pole, had the rider lose the whip in midstretch, battled on gamely inside of SPEAKING SCOUT and prevailed. SPEAKING SCOUT
angled in to save ground off the early pace, advanced three wide around the far turn, came five wide into the lane, continued on the left lead through the
stretch, reached near even terms outside of the winner nearing the sixteenth pole, dueled to the wire and just missed. BIZ BIZ BUZZ set the pace along the
rail past the eighth pole and battled on to save the show. C MY MEISTER steadied at the start, raced off the pace two wide, advanced four wide around the
far turn, angled in nearing the quarter pole, bid inside of foes in midstretch then flattened out late. DUKE OF LOVE prompted the pace two wide while pulling
through the opening half, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. ELDON'S PRINCE saved ground off the pace, went three wide around the far
turn and rallied belatedly. KITODAN saved ground and failed to menace. ALWAYS GAMBLING was fractious in the starting gate, raced two wide and played
no factor. FAST N STEADY was outrun inside. BARONE CESCO was rank entering the first turn, chased the pace three wide and tired in the drive. SPORT
PEPPER chased the pace inside and retreated. RUNNING TIMES AND RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION. EQUIBASE HAND

Footnotes
OCEAN RIDE was never far back, crept closer to the leaders shifting out three wide leaving the far turn, rallied steadily and prevailed late between horses.
SMALL REASON had the two-path on the turns, rallied to a short lead in deep stretch, and just missed between rivals. GONNA BE EPIC went along in the
second flight for six furlongs, wound up behind horses through midstretch, altered course outside for room and was surging outside the top two at the wire.
CHROME FINISH pressed the pace outside DRUM AND DRUMMER, wrested the lead away on the far turn, and weakened through the last sixteenth of a
mile. METEORITO was strung out four to five wide throughout, and could not make any appreciable headway through the lane. SWEENEY'S CAT was last
away, raced well back to the stretch, and improved position without threatening. DRUM AND DRUMMER bumped with SKILLFUL just after the start, cut an
even pace to midway on the far turn, and gave way through the late stages. TRACEABILITY raced close up for six furlongs while three to four wide, and
weakened. COUCH DREAMS was never prominent. LEADING FACTOR bumped with SKILLFUL soon after the start, and tired inside soon after completing
a half-mile. SKILLFUL was bumped between horses away from the gate, and never got close.
