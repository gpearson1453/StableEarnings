Footnotes
SHESAHEATWAVE hopped at the start, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn and wore down SHAMEL in the closing yards to be going
away late. SHARMEL was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run but could not resist
the winner late. MY EXPRESSION broke sharply to duel for the lead while raced three-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and gave way late.
EVERYBODY DOES IT settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. SHOE GAME showed brief speed
from the inside and gave way. RED NOVA disputed the pace from the inside and weakened through the final furlong. JACOMINA was void of early speed,
saved ground through the turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
SUPAH SISTA lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the turn, responded when set down for the drive and was up in the closing yards. OLD TOY was
away in good order to press the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to take a brief lead in mid-stretch but could not resist the winner late. WRIGHT
WINGED settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, checked nearing the sixteenth pole, angled out and finished willingly. ABRAA
JABRAA was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. HADDY UP set a pressured pace from the inside
and gave way through the final furlong. EVER VIGILANT was never far back, saved ground through the turn, steadied nearing the sixteenth pole and gave
way. RAIDERETTE showed brief speed, steadied nearing the half, dropped back and did not menace thereafter.

Footnotes
GRANDPA A. C. stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to gain command nearing the three-sixteenths marker and was ridden out to
increase his advantage. IMPERATOR settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady bid. WED O'S
CHAMP was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished with good late energy. INCLUDE HOO lacked early
foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished with a belated bid. SWAGSATIONAL raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the
second turn and finished evenly. ACTIVE PASS showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not menace. WHATSITTOYA
sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, increased his advantage through the back-stretch and tired after going three-quarters. HIGH
SPEED CHASE raced four-wide through both turns and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

DELIGHTFUL HIPS sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting pace and held BELLA'S BACK safe to the wire. BELLA'S BACK stalked the winner
while racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain on that rival in the drive. GRAZEN VALOR settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out in
mid-stretch and finished with a belated bid. WILLING TO BURN lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. STREET
FLYER settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and lacked the needed rally. THUNDER WOMAN raced off the pacesetters early, moved
three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CALLMEJESSIEJAMES lagged, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention.

early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. PAITASKA chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a
half. SHARK HARBOR settled off the leaders from between foes, steadied nearing the seven-sixteenths pole and was not a factor. WE MISS GENO dueled
