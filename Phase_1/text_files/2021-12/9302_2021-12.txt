Footnotes
GEMSTONE GAL dueled for the lead with HOLY TUTTA BELLA while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin after going a half and drew off through the
lane with complete authority. BLAZINGBELLABLU was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled in nearing the
sixteenth pole and finished willingly.. LADY LANA chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and lacked the needed closing response. DANCE
SHOES was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly in the drive. HOLY TUTTA BELLA disputed the pace with
the winner while racing three-wide and gave way after going three-quarters. GRAN MANNA lagged throughout.

NUMEROLOGIST settled off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive, reached the fore with a furlong to run but could
not resist the winner late. MCENTIRE was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with a late bid.

dispute the pace from between foes and gave way through the final furlong. HOLLYWOOD HEAT was off slow, lagged early and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
TIM'S BUDDY was away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive and wore SORRISO down in the
closing yards. SORRISO sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace and yielded to the winner late. A NEW TREND lacked
early speed, saved ground through the turn and finished with a steady bid. SOUTHERN MOJO settled off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn,
angled out into the stretch and finished evenly. ZOMBIE ALAN raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. JAQUET
raced off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SWITCH BACK raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide through
the turn and did not menace. OVER EZ was void of early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. PS BETTIN ON YOU showed brief
speed and weakened. TACKSON lagged throughout.
