Footnotes
TONALA stalked off the rail the first turn then drew aim past the half mile pole, took the nod at the five sixteenths, moved clear into the far turn, was only
mildly asked at the head of the lane and drew off mostly of her own initiative. SILVER AND BLUES steadied lightly at the start and settled off the rail, bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and settled for second best. SUPERSTASIA angled to the rail to rate the pace, came
under pressure past the half mile pole, was caught at the five sixteenths, dropped back at the rail into the far turn and flattened stride. PLAY CHARADES
stalked in the three path, bid toward the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little further. SUPER EIGHTY EIGHT settled back in
the two and three paths and showed little response through the backstretch. CAN I EVER rated close to the early pace in the four and five paths, left the first
turn outside and gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, but was of little consequence.

Footnotes
CHARM WEAVER gave chase and raced close off the rail on the turn, dug in for the lead inside the sixteenth pole and drew away later yards. MOSLER'S
TOUCH was hustled clear and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the quarter pole and rounded the turn at the rail, was
steadily encouraged from the head of the lane but gave up the lead inside the sixteenth pole and flattened later yards. SINGING HARMONY chased through
the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn, eased outward into the lane and ran evenly down the lane. BAYOU BOUGIE chased, rounded the turn at the
rail and finished evenly. MISS GRANDSTANDER chased through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn, drifted approaching the head of the lane, left
the turn about the five path and showed little further. LIL SWEETHEART was not a factor, as was HONEY BEEST not a factor. IRISH KNOCKOUT proved
to be no factor, was eased in the lane, unsaddled past the wire, limped back to the paddock then walked back to the barn.

DR. GRANT stalked off the rail then challenged leaving the three eighths pole, took over two dee approaching the head of the lane, drew clear past the
eighth pole and was kept alert through the lane. MAKE THE WAY CLEAR was taken outward from the heels of rivals into the first turn and settled off the
pace leaving the turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and dueled through the stretch for second.
HOLIDAY AVENUE broke outward across the path of Wish For Peace then stalked inside, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the
far turn at the rail then outfinished for second the final sixteenth. DIVINING DANCER angled in to rate the pace, came under pressure at the three eighths
pole, was caught at the rail approaching the head of the lane then weakened inside the eighth pole. WISH FOR PEACE became a bit fractious in the gate
then shut off at the break, was forced out into the first turn and settled off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, though, weakened at the rail on the
far turn. THATZA ALPHA was roughed from between horses into the first turn and settled off the pace, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths

HYPOTHESIS settled close inside and raced at the rail on the turn, came around GOLDEN KEY leaving the eighth pole, dug in for the lead later yards and
inched further ahead nearing the wire. The latter was hustled along inside, took the lead nearing the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, dug in
leaving the turn but was caught later yards and reluctantly ceded nearing the wire. MY LOVELY GIRL rated close, rounded the turn in the three and four
paths, drifted a bit into the lane and finished evenly. COMBINATION gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail then angled to the five path toward the end
of the turn, finished well and was gaining on third. GRUMPELSTILTSKIN chased, raced near the rail on the turn, drifted into the lane and finished evenly.
MOSS BOSS gave chase through the backstretch, ran in the five path of the turn and ran evenly down the lane. I GOT A ROCK pressured the pace from
the three eighths pole, dropped back two deep midway on the turn and weakened into the lane.

INSPIRING JUSTICE rated a clear pace inside, came under pressure at the rail midway on the turn and was steadily handled through the lane. UPHEAVAL
gave chase, raced close off the rail through the turn, though, had to settle for second. WON DOZEN BANKS chased through the backstretch, raced close
about the four path on the turn, dropped back nearing the head of the lane, though, finished evenly. AUBURN MILL chased, rounded the turn at the rail then
flattened the final sixteenth. SINGANOTHERSONG gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the five path and finished evenly. WIZARD OF ODDS gave
chase through the backstretch, ran in the three path of the turn but showed little in the lane. BROTHER SKYE was not a factor. EL FENOMENO broke
awkwardly then bobbled, appeared off stride early, was eased toward the five sixteenths pole and walked off post race.

Footnotes
STRONG LIL KOKORO was jostled at the break then rated close inside the first turn, inched closer nearing the five sixteenths pole, bid into the far turn
though lacked room toward the head of the lane, briefly lost momentum leaving the eighth pole but came between horses with the lead mid-stretch and dug
in determinedly to keep C R'S MANDATE at bay. The latter was bumped leaving the gate then stalked in the three path the first turn, took the lead past the
half mile pole, came under pressure nearing the three eighths and contested even terms two deep on the far turn, dueled to recover a slim brief lead
mid-stretch but was outfinished the final sixteenth. AZURE FIRE settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn about the three path and finished well to take third under the wire. TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS settled off the rail on the opening turn
then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and was nipped from third under the
wire. JAXJAXXORJACKS broke in to make contact with Strong Lil Kokoro then stalked off the rail, challenged between horses at the three eighths pole,
contested even terms nearest the rail on the far turn then weakened the final sixteenth. PONTICELLO broke outward to make contact with Strong Lil kokoro
and raced well off the pace and off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, angled to the six
path leaving the turn but showed little further. WEAVINTHEBLOCKS raced off the pace about the four path the first turn, left the turn outside and gave
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, had range in the five path entering the far turn then weakened. ROCK FILE raced well back and left the first turn
outside, bid past the seven sixteenths pole then weakened in the seven path of the far turn. LASHER broke outward to make contact with C R's Mandate
then closed to the lead while tapering to the inside, was caught past the half mile pole, dropped back toward the five sixteenths then eased at the rail into
the far turn.
