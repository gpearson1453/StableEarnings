BRIMAGE sped clear to take control, led two then three wide around the turn, remained clear through the lane then drew away under urging in the final
furlong. BELLE MY BELLE dropped back early, took the turn four then five wide, rallied late and edged PEARLS AND HEELS for the place honors. PEARLS
AND HEELS stalked off the rail, loomed four wide into the stretch, failed to kick on late and got edged for the place. SHESHOTINCLEVELAND chased the
speed outside a rival then in the two path on the turn and lacked the needed response. TRIPDOWNMEMORYLANE hit the gate to come away a bit slow,
went up to chase outside a rival, navigated the turn four wide and weakened. LASYA DANCE chased along the rail up the backstretch, lost ground around
the turn and tired in the drive. OPENING QUARTER FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
CHAO MAR unhurried in the early stages and moved to the two path, advanced three then four wide on the second bend, rallied and reached the top pair
with a furlong remaining, took over inside the eighth pole and won going away. QUEEN OF LOVE went three deep or four wide around the first turn, chased
the leader then went up to take control between rivals at the halfway point, held a short lead through the turn, lost command in upper stretch but continued
to fight on and regain the lead at the eighth pole, was soon overtaken by the winner and stayed on to hold the place. GLORY OF CHROME had speed
inside a trio of rivals on the first turn, appeared to be getting out and steadied late on the bend, chased two wide into the far turn, bid four wide leaving the
bend, took over in upper stretch, dueled outside of QUEEN OF LOVE and relinquished the lead at the eight pole, flattened in deep stretch and saved the
show. SLEW SOUTH raced along the inside then angled three wide around the first turn, went four wide into the second bend, six wide into the stretch and
missed the show. CAL ROUGH settled off the pace on the inside, moved out and went two wide into the second bend, angled four wide leaving that turn
and failed to menace. SHANGHAI DAZZLER away quickly and was fanned four deep or five wide on the first turn, chased the leader into the backstretch,
bid three deep at the half-mile pole, kept the pressure on from outside through the second turn and weakened in the lane. MISTAKA angled down to the two
path, dropped back on the second bend and had little left for the drive. ROSES FOR LIFE sped to the front between rivals and cleared leaving the first turn,
lost the lead and vied from inside at the four furlong mark, fought into the second bend, lost touch approaching the five-sixteenths pole and tired.

angled four wide leaving the bend, bid three deep in upper stretch and got outkicked in the final furlong. MCWHERTER displayed keen early foot, led two
wide through the turn, remained unchallenged into the lane, was overtaken with three-sixteenths remaining and flattened to third. BARRISTAN THE BOLD
(GB) chased inside a pair of rivals, got bumped a few times and checked past the seven-sixteenths pole, remained inside then angled out at the top of the
lane and lacked a rally. FRATELLI chased between rivals to the turn, got pinballed and checked past the seven-sixteenths pole, came three wide into the
lane and weakened. THERE WAS A RIDER'S OBJECTION AND STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE INCIDENT ON THE TURN. AFTER A REVIEW,
THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED JAMMING EDDY FROM FIRST TO FIFTH FOR SHIFTING IN AND CAUSING INTERFERENCE TO BARRISTAN THE
BOLD (GB) AND FRATELLI PAST THE SEVEN-SIXTEENTHS POLE, COSTING BOTH RUNNERS A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
PARK AVENUE was fanned seven wide into the first turn then moved down to the five path on the first turn, stalked well off the rail, bid four deep on the
second bend and four wide into the stretch, cleared with three-sixteenths remaining and was ridden out to the wire. FI FI PHAROAH settled inside then
moved off the rail, went between into the far turn, three wide into the stretch, lacked room in upper stretch, angled out and went between runners in
midstretch and outkicked OVER ATTRACTED for the place. OVER ATTRACTED chased two wide early, moved out on the backstretch, traveled three deep
into the far turn and closed in five wide around the bend and lost the bob for second. LA PULCINELA went six wide into the first turn then shifted to the four
path, stalked off the rail then between into the second bend, was driven two wide into the lane, drifted out and bumped rival past the eighth pole and kept on
for a minor award. KRISTI'S TIGER pressed the pace from outside, vied three wide on the far turn and flattened in the late stages. LISETTE traveled five
then three wide around the first turn, chased off the inside then angled to the rail for the second bend, asked into the stretch but had to pause briefly at the
quarter pole when lacking room, soon gained a clear path but could not rally. DERBY QUEST took the first turn four then three wide, moved down to the two
path for the second bend, angled four wide into the stretch and failed to menace. NICE ICE vied for the lead into the first turn then set the pace under
pressure from the outside, vied two wide through the second bend, lost command in upper stretch, got bumped between rivals past the eighth pole and
weakened. LADY NOGUEZ raced off the rail early then moved inside, came two wide into the stretch and was not a factor. BESTRELLA (IRE) went four
wide into the first turn then angled down to the two path, chased the leader then bid inside at the half-mile pole, fought to the far turn but could not keep up
around the far turn, chased along the rail to the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
BIG SHAMROCK chased inside, angled out to the three path on the turn, continued to give chase into the furlong grounds then launched a late bid in the
final sixteenth and surged past the runner-up. UNWRITTEN CODE set the pace in the early stages, led two wide into the stretch, traveled clear to the
sixteenth pole and got run down by the winner. GHOSTEM chased along the inside to the stretch and got up for the show. QUICK TAKE settled in the early
stages, went four then five wide on the turn and got edged for the show honors. MY YVONNE off slow to begin, raced near the back three wide into the turn,
tipped to the four path entering the stretch and improved placing through the lane. ARTISAN DANCER stalked four wide and never responded when called
upon. ADDYDIDIT dropped back early, traveled five then six wide on the turn and was not a factor. PRINCESS CATERINA raced up close early then
dropped back around the turn, exited the turn three wide and came up empty. AM YISRAEL CHAI chased outside a rival, three then four wide on the turn
and tired. DR. ANGEL tracked well off the rail outside a rival, took the turn five wide and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
WHISTLER'S STYLE went four wide around the first turn, sat off the pace wide up the backstretch, moved closer and went five deep into the far turn,
swooped by at the five-sixteenths pole, cleared into the stretch and remained strong under a drive to the line. RENEGADE PRINCESS chased inside then
shifted to the two path on the first turn, angled down to the inside while taking closer order leaving the backstretch, shifted to the two path then back inside
on the second bend, could not threaten the winner late but was clearly second best. JUDY WITH GRACE got bumped entering the first turn four wide,
chased four deep entering the second bend, lacked a bid in the stretch but held the show. AWESOME PAMELA off slow from inside, lagged behind early,
moved out wide on the backstretch, went five then six wide around the far turn and kept on for a minor award. MEDUSA'S GAZE angled to the rail on the
first turn, chased off the rail on the backstretch, got blocked behind a runner and checked into the far turn, angled out and came six wide into the stretch and
failed to threaten. DYNAMITE QUEEN bumped rival entering the first turn, chased three deep into the second bend, raced between rivals through the turn,
lacked room and steadied behind a pair of rivals at the quarter pole and flattened out. SUEZAAANA bobbled to the lead leaving the gate, dueled inside a
rival for command, cleared at the seven-sixteenths pole, was overtaken with five-sixteenths remaining and faded through the drive. MONGOLIAN DREAM
tucked inside on the first turn, angled from the two path to the four path leaving the second bend and was not a factor. LIFE'S EMOTIONS came out leaving
the gate, showed speed six wide into the turn, angled down to the four path while dueling for the lead, inched ahead on the backstretch, lost the lead at the
nine-sixteenths pole, could not keep up into the far turn, weakened around the final bend, tired in the drive and was eased to the wire.

Footnotes
PRIANO sped to the front while vying with rivals on both sides, held a short lead over outside rival on the turn, cleared into the stretch and drew away under
urging. TWICE THE PRICE coaxed from the gate to be forwardly placed early, chased three wide into the turn, angled to the four path leaving the bend and
finished willingly for second. EXIT ROW broke slow and was forced in a bit at the start, stalked inside then swung out leaving the turn, summoned a mild
rally and gained the show. MOUNT OLYMPIC was off alertly from outside, had speed outside a trio of rivals early, went three wide around the turn and
weakened. ANNIE'S CHIEF tracked two wide to the turn, shifted out to the four path around the bend and came up empty. MOON CIRCUMFERENCE
trailed four wide into the turn, exited the bend five wide and was not a factor. WHACKO KID broke in a bit, showed early speed inside rivals, chased into the
turn, saved ground into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
TRUTH PREVAILS chased the top pair three wide into and around the turn, bid between foes with three-sixteenths remaining, reached the front
approaching the eighth pole and held gamely over the runner-up. JAMMINJL chased off the rail then moved to the two path, angled to the inside in the
stretch, rallied along the fence but could not get by the winner. BIG PASSION chased the speed from outside, went five wide into the turn, four wide into the
stretch, bid four deep in upper stretch, took over at the three-sixteenths pole, relinquished command nearing the eighth pole and faltered late. LAKER JET
trailed into the turn, went four wide around the bend, moved into striking distance in the stretch but needed to find more late. ROLINGA was off a bit slow to
begin, angled to the rail on the turn and lacked the needed rally. STRADARI dueled for the lead in the early going, battled into the stretch, fought to the
three-sixteenths pole and weakened. ISLAND LIFE dueled for the lead from outside into and around the bend, fought to midstretch and weakened in the
furlong grounds. DURGA traveled along the inside, shifted out into the stretch and was not a factor.
