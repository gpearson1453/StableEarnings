Footnotes
JOHNNY OIL tracked close up on the inside, bid two wide on the turn, rallied outside of BIZZY GILLESPIE, wore down that rival, then quickly drew off under
urging. BIZZY GILLESPIE showed good speed outside to set the pace, responded when challenged, dug in gamely in upper stretch, yielded grudgingly and
remained well clear for the place spot. TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT raced off the pace inside, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied mildly outside and got the
nod for third. NO TOLERANCE raced two wide off the pace, chased on the turn, weakened in the lane and lost third at the wire. HE RUNS THE LINE raced
two wide off the pace, went three wide on the turn and lacked a rally. ALPHA'S CANDY MAN stalked two wide, then chased and faded. DUCK DUCKY
GOOSE raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. RICKIE'S MELODY stumbled at the start and steadied early, then raced
off the rail, off the pace and did not factor.
