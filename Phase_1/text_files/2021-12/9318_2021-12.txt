Footnotes
CAROTARI raced two wide in striking distance soon after the start, took over the lead leaving the three eighths pole, saved ground through the turn,
widened to a clear advantage in the upper stretch, came off the inside and remained sharp under steady pressure. EXTRAVAGANT KID settled near
midpack in opening stages, loomed three wide late on the turn, launched a four wide turning for home, sustained a steady bid through the lane and dug in
late to hold place. SMOKIN' JAY waited patiently along the rail through the turn, tipped two wide and given cue near the furlong marker, edged up closer
and narrowly missed place. YES I AM FREE tracked the top pair into the turn, launched a two wide bid turning for home, remained in contention past the
furlong marker then finished evenly. XY SPEED raced in range saving ground, shifted out wider for the drive and failed to kick on under pressure. OMAHA
CITY raced off the early pace, was ridden along three wide through the turn, came out wider for the drive and lacked a needed rally. ROMARIO bumped
with BREAKTHROUGH at the start and dropped to last, continued in the back of the pack along the outside into the lane and had no response.
BREAKTHROUGH bumped with ROMARIO at the start, briefly held a slim lead then lost the advantage to the eventual winner, remained forwardly placed
around the turn and tired in the drive. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE, RUN UP UNAVAILABLE

Footnotes
BRASSTOWN set the pace in the two path, drifted out through the lane and widened under right-handed urging. HERO TIGER saved ground in midpack,
had a wide open path inside of the winner throughout the stretch and finished evenly to gain the place. TRAPPEZOID stalked the pace three wide and
weakened a bit in the lane. BLESSED JOURNEY bobbled at the break, saved ground and never threatened. CHUCKY chased the pace two wide and tired
after a half. ONE EYED JACK had brief speed three wide, faded and was trying to lug in from the quarter pole to midstretch.

Footnotes
AMAZIN QUEEN went along in the second flight within range early, advanced four wide approaching the stretch, bid outside rivals through the furlong
grounds, and was up outside LANIAKEA STORM after a late duel. LANIAKEA STORM got floated out five wide by PAINTBRUSH coming off the first turn,
tracked outside up the backstretch, reached even terms for command outside PAINTBRUSH turning for home, fought on between rivals into the last eighth
of a mile, was edged inside the winner late, then was vanned off after the finish. PAINTBRUSH bumped with LIVINHERBESTLIFE at the start, was rank
under early restraint on the first turn four wide, tracked outside BLAME THE VETS up the backstretch, gained a short lead on the far turn and was
immediately hooked from outside by LANIAKEA STORM, stayed on her left lead through the stretch and weakened inside. CAGUA failed to factor three
wide, but did enough to go clear for the last major share. LIVINHERBESTLIFE was bumped lightly between horses at the start, was under a firm hold early
two wide, and tired before reaching the stretch. ENOUGH RAIN broke slowly, and was never prominent. BLAME THE VETS established a slow pace to the
far turn, and gave way readily when challenged. SHE IS ROYALTY bumped with LIVINHERBESTLIFE at the start, and was through early inside.

Footnotes
SCARABEA was allowed to settle out of the gate and remained unhurried in the back, shifted out and picked up the pace late on the final turn, came five
wide into the lane, gathered momentum under steady pressure and drew clear. EXCEPT TEMPTATION stalked the pacesetter through early stages, moved
up closer two wide near the quarter pole, took a slim lead at the furlong marker then failed to hold off the winner. SITTING PRETTY took over the lead soon
after the start, set the pace and held firm through the final turn, got collared by EXCEPT TEMPTATION at the furlong marker and weakened to show. RED
LIGHT RACER tracked the pace up the backstretch, was ridden along three wide around the final turn and continued a steady even bid through the lane.
ZURI was allowed to settle through early stages, hustled up four wide around the far turn and failed to kick on. CIELO D'ORO raced midpack near the
inside, came out a path at the head of the lane and had no response. VIVA LA RED rated two wide off the early pace, was ridden along the inside into the
lane and made no headway.

Footnotes
ALWAYS SHOPPING was off a bit slow, advanced four wide into the first turn, reached near even terms two wide late on that turn, pressed two wide from
there, bid between foes nearing the lane, dueled inside of HARAJUKU through the lane while mostly a head behind that foe, battled on gamely and took the
lead in the final strides. HARAJUKU (IRE) settled off the pace three wide, advanced three and four wide around the far turn, took the lead turning for home,
dueled outside of the winner to wire and just missed. BEAUTIFUL LOVER tracked the pace two wide, could not keep pace with the top two in the lane but
stayed on to gain the show. ONYX checked off heels entering the first turn, raced off the pace two wide around all three turns and had a mild stretch rally.
HUNGRY KITTEN was devoid of speed, saved ground around the turns, swung widest in the lane and rallied belatedly. CANDY FLOWER set the pace
along the rail, was collared nearing the lane, resisted to midstretch then weakened. SORREL (IRE) saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch
and lacked the needed rally. SWEET SERENADE saved ground in range and came up empty in the lane. KEY BISCAYNE checked entering the first turn,
became keyed up the first time through the stretch and pulled her way toward the front, pressed three wide around the second turn and down the
backstretch then gave way rounding the far turn. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH FRACTIONS AND RUN UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
HIGH PRESS was outsprinted early, swung four wide approaching the stretch, and rallied steadily to overhaul the leaders from outside late. MASTER Q
pressed ADMIRAL TRUFFLES from outside, dueled for the lead through upper stretch, and ran on with good courage. CAN'T BE BROKEN tracked the
leaders in the clear three wide, was roused early on the turn, loomed a threat a quarter-mile out, idled a bit once straightened away for the drive, then ran on
late to get up for the show. ADMIRAL TRUFFLES set the pace inside, dueled inside MASTER Q turning for home, and weakened through the final furlong.
MINDSHIP Q lacked early speed, swung to the far outside in the five-path at the top of the lane, and could not gain. JOYFUL SURPRISE faded inside after
a half-mile. D BLACK MAMBA spotted the field a couple lengths at the break, and showed little trailing two wide.

Footnotes
CYBERVIKING was reserved racing in the back, swung five wide into the lane, responded willingly under left handed urging, rallied outside while moving
inward and finished going away. CLAPTON picked up the pace nearing the half mile marker, moved up to engage the top pair late on the turn, vied for the
lead turning for home, shook free and held command at the furlong marker then failed to be a match when the winner swept by. THE GREEN CRUSADER
raced off the top trio around the turn, coaxed three wide into the lane, sustained a steady stretch bid and stayed on for a share. SO DETERMINED was
ridden along racing off the early pace, came four wide into the lane and lacked the needed response for impact. ONE MORE SCORE vied outside of BIZ
BIZ BUZZ through early stages, dueled with CLAPTON turning for home then came up empty in the final furlong. BIZ BIZ BUZZ vied inside of ONE MORE
SCORE for the early lead and came up tired late on the turn.

split rivals near the eighth pole, took the lead soon after, was overpowered by the winner but finished well to hold second. STRONG ODOR lacked speed
while racing two wide, angled out in upper stretch, swung wider leaving the eighth pole and rallied for the show. BEAUTIFUL GRACE stalked the pace two
wide, bid nearing the lane, was floated out turning for home battled between foes to midstretch and weakened a bit late. AMBASSADOR LUNA raced four

outkicked. MISS AURAMET hit the starting gate, was sawed off early, advanced three wide around the turn, was pushed out entering the lane, bid between
foes nearing the eighth pole and flattened out. INTRODUCED steadied early, raced off the pace two wide and never threatened. CAT'S ASTRAY set the
pace along the rail, drifted out turning for home, battled to midstretch and tired. MORNING MOLLY failed to menace while racing three wide. DANA'S
