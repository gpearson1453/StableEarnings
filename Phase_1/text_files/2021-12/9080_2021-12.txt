Footnotes
BAILESTON LASSIE hustled up to the lead soon after the start, set the pace and held firm around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, remained clear
at the eighth pole, then held late under a driving finish. FIRST SQUADRON tracked the pacesetter while saving ground through the turn, hustled up two
wide entering the lane, sustained a steady bid for BAILSTON LASSIE through the stretch run, inched way up closer in final strides and just missed. SENSE
OF SELF raced off the early speed, was ridden along five wide into the lane, gathered momentum under steady pressure and finished well. LIPLINER
tracked the leader racing two wide through the turn, launched a three wide bid heading into the lane, remained in contention with a furlong remaining then
flattened out. JUJU'S SPECIALGIRL raced in contention, then steadied entering the turn, weakened, came three to four wide into the lane and failed to
regain. APRIL'S GEM raced off the early pace, was ridden along five wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. GO STORMIN GIRL raced in range in
opening stages, got in a bit tight entering the turn and steadily weakened. U. S. CURRENCY lacked speed and saved ground to no avail.

ran down rival nearing the wire. SATIATE sped to the lead at the start, saved ground around the first turn, set the pace by a comfortable margin through the
backstretch, came under pressure turning for home, fought back along the rail in the final furlong, then got edged out in closing strides. STACK SHACK
raced three wide around the first turn, stalked the pacesetter through the backstretch, headed in pursuit near the quarter pole, and sustained a steady three
wide bid through the lane. CHAINMAIL tracked the pace along the inside through the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and had no response
when called upon. BOWS N LACE stumbled at the start and raced in the back throughout.

couple paths under pressure and needed more for impact. COCO BRAVADO got in a bit tight between rivals in early stages, was ridden along four wide into

Footnotes
JOURNEYIST prompted the early pace, raced in striking distance late on the turn, stayed on determinedly in pursuit through the lane and drew clear in late
stages. GHAALEB'S CITY broke out and bumped with rival at the start, tracked the top two leaders around the turn, sustained a three wide bid through the
lane and got up late for place. JUST A WONDER took a solid bump at the start, still managed to grab the early lead, set a pressured pace over
JOURNEYIST, held a slight edge under pressure at the furlong marker, then came up empty in deep stretch. SUMMER BELLE broke out and bumped with
rival at the start, raced widest through early stages, came in a couple paths through the turn, came back out five wide for the drive and had no kick. HAPPY
SAILS raced off the early pace and saved ground to no avail. MY BACK PAGES broke out and bumped with rivals at the start, raced off the pace and failed
to move into contention. LADY BABA got bumped back at the start and never menaced.

of the lane, held a slim lead at the furlong marker, then kicked clear. NIGHT THINGS raced two to three wide through the first turn, then remained unhurried
in the back, picked up the pace three to four wide around the far turn, came four wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and got up late for place.
CAMPIONI stalked the pace through the backstretch, dueled with YOU'RE ON COREY around the far turn, remained in striking distance past the furlong
marker, then weakened in late stages and lost place. YOU'RE IN COREY vied for the lead around the first turn, set a pressured pace through the
backstretch, dueled for the lead with CAMPIONI around the far turn then tired in the drive. BULLDOG OF BERGEN tracked inside under a snug hold, was
put to a drive inside late on the far turn, came off the inside turning for home and steadily faded. ESKENDEREYAS DREAM vied for the lead around the first
turn, pressed the pace through the backstretch then faded around the final turn.

Footnotes
AGAVE KID was forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, launched a bid heading into the lane, vied four deep at the eighth pole, dug in under
steady pressure and drew clear. SPINSTER ROAD rated through early stages, then picked up the pace late on the turn, swung wide into the lane, angled in
a couple paths under pressure, stayed on with response and finished second best. PITAMAN sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace and held
firm around the turn, vied for the lead at the eighth pole, then held on for show. TALIS PARK GRAD was never far back, launched a two wide bid into the
lane, vied for the lead at the eighth pole, then took the inside position and yielded late. FRONTANA tracked the pace through early stages, was ridden along
three wide around the turn, came out five wide into the lane and lacked the needed response for impact. MEXICO MEMORIES sat patiently along the rail,
shifted out wide at the head of the lane and failed to move on. DEVIL'S RULE raced in contention along the inside, launched a rail bid turning for home, vied
for the lead at the furlong marker then came up empty in the final sixteenth.

TELLER rated near midpack through early stages, launched a bid three to four wide in the upper stretch, gathered strong momentum under steady pressure
and pulled away. MOVE ON OVER set the pace through the backstretch, got collared for the lead midway around the far turn, moved back up to duel in the
upper stretch, was no match when the winner took control but stayed on with response and finished clearly second best. BABA'S BOY settled near midpack
early on, traveled two wide around the far turn, launched a four wide bid in the upper stretch and churned on for a share. SIMPLE LOGIC stalked the pace
through the backstretch, took over the lead midway around the turn, sustained bid in the upper stretch then faded past the furlong marker. EASTON ROCKS
raced off the early pace saving ground, angled out late on the turn and failed to move on. PRINCE OF MAYHEM was forwardly placed racing just off the
early leader, then steadily retreated midway around the far turn. TOWN AGENDA raced in the back throughout.

Footnotes
TAP THE MOJO raced up close through early stages, dueled for the lead around the far turn, stayed on gamely through the lane and edged away in deep
stretch. MAXIMUS IMAGE was unhurried and raced off the pace, swung wide into the lane, rallied along the outside and gained place. GIANT'S FORREST
tracked the top trio through early stages, hustled up four wide in the upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and gained show. SIRCORRI set the pace
through the backstretch, dueled for the lead around the far turn, battled back with the winner in the lane then had no closing kick left in reserve. NORCO
rated outside through early stages, moved up three wide through the far turn, took closer order two wide in the upper stretch then flattened out in final
stages. MR. LUV MAKER steadied along the rail heading into the first turn, rated near midpack through the backstretch, came under a ride along the inside
then two wide in the upper stretch and failed to respond. ALLEGIANCE pressed the pace through the backstretch, failed to gain under pressure two wide
around the far turn then faded in the lane. DANCIN NICKY lost contact with the field, jogged in and walked off. THE TRAINER OF MR LUV MAKER
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST TAP THE MOJO FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FIRST TURN WHICH RESULTED IN NO CHANGE
