Footnotes
DISTRACTEDPRINCESS broke in and bumped rival, chased the leader early on then went up to duel for command from outside, took a short lead with
three furlong remaining, cleared at the quarter pole, then widened through the lane under mild hand urging and was ridden out to the wire. MAP TO MY
HEART broke quickly and cleared to an easy lead, crossed over and controlled the pace two or three wide, dueled with the winner into and around the turn,
could not keep pace with a quarter mile remaining and stayed on for a clear second. WIKI WAHINE was off slow to begin, came in and crossed into the path
of LIFE IN PARADISE approaching the five-eighths pole, went two wide into the lane and lacked further response. LIFE IN PARADISE got bumped leaving
the gate, lost his path and checked nearing the five-eighths pole, saved ground trailing the field around the turn and was not a factor. FOLLOWING AN
INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH WIKI WAHINE CAME OVER AND TOOK THE PATH OF LIFE IN PARADISE NEARING THE
FIVE-EIGHTHS POLE, IT DID NOT COST THAT RIVAL A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
FOWLER BLUE was forwardly placed in the early going, tracked in the two path entering the far turn, eased out further and came four wide into the stretch,
chased the leader under right then left-handed urging and inherited the win when BRIGHT LEAF displaced his rider in the final sixteenth. TOWN BOY
rushed to the front after coming away last in a clean start, vied for the lead between rivals, battled around the far turn, proved no match in the lane and
altered around the fallen rider late. KING APOLLO sped to the front, vied with a pair of rivals from inside, fought to the quarter pole, could not keep pace into
the lane and altered around the fallen rider late. SOCAL RED went three to four wide around the clubhouse turn and settled at the back, remained off the rail
and came two wide into the stretch and failed to menace. ARRABIATA stalked the top trio from inside, angled three wide around the far turn and weakened.
BRIGHT LEAF stalked four then three wide around the first turn, went up to vie for command three deep, shook free into the stretch, jumped tracks then
propped and unseated the rider in the final sixteenth and walked off following the race. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT
BRIGHT LEAF CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS IN THE FINAL SIXTEENTH AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

SMITTEN BY KITTEN sped to the front from inside, cleared outside rival at the half-mile pole, led two to three wide into the stretch, drifted out in the drive
and held the runner-up at bay. FEELING GRAZEFUL stalked outside a pair of rivals early, went four wide into the turn, was closest in pursuit three wide
entering the stretch, drifted out in the lane while looming from outside but could not summon the needed late kick. ALL DIALED IN broke slow and outward a
bit before being quickly corrected, chased from inside to the stretch, kept on within striking distance in the drive but weakened late. SELF ISOLATION
pressed the pace early from outside then chased past the half-mile pole, went three wide around the turn and weakened. BELLEO'S MUSIC broke a bit
slow, chased the pace outside a rival, went two wide into the turn, angled out to the four path leaving the bend and also weakened. CAYTON KID settled
early well off the rail, went four wide into the turn then angled down to the rail through the bend and had little left for the stretch run. ANNIETOWN dropped
back early, chased in the two path nearing the turn, steered out four wide around the bend then came back in a bit and entered the stretch three wide and
tired. FEELING GRAZEUL WORE CAULKS. HALF-MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA STREET vied between rivals early then dueled outside of INVICTATATUS into the turn, cleared midway around the bend and angled to the
rail, drew away in upper stretch then shortened a bit late but held safely. HEARTFULLOFSTARS was allowed to settle just off the pacesetters early on, was
ridden along the rail through the turn, moved out a bit in the lane and gained ground on the winner late. ZIMBA WARRIOR attended the pace three deep
early then chased the top pair leaving the backstretch, went four wide into the turn then angled down to the two path around the bend and flattened out in
the stretch. INVICTATATUS vied for inside a pair of rivals early then dueled with CALIFORNIA STREET leaving the backstretch, lost contact and dropped
back between rivals at the five-sixteenths pole, chased three wide into the lane and faded.

WHARTON stalked the leader early from inside, put in a bid along the rail and took over at the seven-sixteenths pole, vied with a trio of runners through the
turn, cleared in upper stretch and drew off. GOT THUNDER stalked the leader from outside, bid three deep around the turn, driven two wide into the lane,
proved no match for the winner but kept on to hold the place. ARMAGNAC got bumped on both sides at the start, raced in range four deep early on, bid four
deep around the turn, chased three wide into the drive and flattened to third. DON'T SWEAR DAVE stalked in the two path into the turn, exited the bend
three wide and could not summon the needed response. BLUE DOG got bumped from outside at the start, trailed early, went four then three wide around
the turn and failed to menace. MO THEM DOWN jumped out to the lead quickly, set the pace with a short lead early, challenged from both sides into the

FLYING DRUMMER chased three then four wide around the first turn, tracked four deep in middle stages, came under a ride two to three wide on the far
turn, reeled in the leader in upper stretch and took over at the eight pole, kicked clear and won going away. COVER ME UP controlled the pace in the early
stages, inched away on the backstretch, widened around the far turn, held a diminishing lead in upper stretch and lost command with a furlong remaining
and churned on for a clear second. NOBLE UNION stalked the pace from inside, was crowded a bit at the seven-sixteenths pole and dropped back to last
entering the far turn, split foes at the quarter pole, went two to three wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. MOMENT OF PEACE pulled into the first turn
then went up to chase between runners, moved to the rail on the final turn and tired. TREBBIANO went three deep around the first turn, two wide into the
second bend, angled four wide nearing the stretch and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
ARHAM raced up close outside the pacesetter early, chased three then two wide on the turn, drew alongside with a sixteenth remaining and edged past to
prove best in the end. TOOK CHARGE sent for the lead and set the pace up the backstretch, angled to the rail around the turn, put to right then left-handed
urging in the lane and yielded late. CANADIAN PRIDE broke well then stalked the leader up the backstretch, traveled along the rail then a bit off the inside
into the drive, could not find the needed late kick but finished willingly to hold the show. STRONGCONSTITUTION sat off the pace on the inside, tipped out
into the stretch and put in a mild late bid for a minor award. LOUD MOUTH tracked four wide through the turn and flattened in the lane. GROUND ATTACK
raced between foes at the back early then outside a rival, went two then three wide on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
QUANTUM QUEST got bumped from outside at the start, shook it off and went up to take command with VERRAGIO to the inside, cleared that rival leaving
the backstretch, showed the way two wide into the drive and drew off under left-handed encouragement. SETTECENTO broke slow and greenly at the start,
chased along the inside in mid-pack entering the turn, remained inside then tipped two wide into the stretch, continued to move out in upper stretch and
rallied for the place. CARELESS KITTEN tracked the pacesetter from between runners, went three wide on the turn and got edged for the place.
VERRAGIO pressed the pace early from inside then chased the winner into the turn, saved ground along the inside but flattened out in the drive. DUTCH
BUS had his head turned and came away slow at the start, saved ground around the bend from off the pace, tipped out in the stretch and improved position.
HEREDIA BOXER chased off the inside, lost ground between foes on the turn and weakened. IRRESISTIBLY SEXY was fractious in the gate, broke slow
and lost his path at the start, trailed up the backstretch, went six wide into the turn, advanced widest of all through the turn, came five wide into the stretch
and failed to threaten. CIRCLE BACK broke out while coming away quickly, dropped to mid-pack while well off the rail, entered the turn five wide and exited
four wide and tired in the stretch. THE BOSS HARTY tracked outside a pair of rivals early, navigated the turn four wide and faded through the lane. DREW
BIG unhurried in the beginning off the rail, took the turn three to four wide and tired in the lane. NO MALICE broke in and bumped rival at the start, dropped
back early, went four then five wide around the turn and was outrun.
