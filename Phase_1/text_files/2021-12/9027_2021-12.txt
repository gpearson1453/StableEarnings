Footnotes
AGENT COOPER, bumped at the start, quickly recovered to gain a forward placing stalking just off the leaders while angling inside on the backstretch,
switched out sharply nearing upper stretch exchanging several bumps with MELINA'S DREAM, but was collected to dispute the issue between foes through
the lane to narrowly prevail under pressure. AZURE SKY tracked off the second flight along the inside racing through the backstretch, saved ground through
the bend, came through along the rail to challenge for command in upper stretch, continued willingly to press the issue to the end but was outkicked.
MELINA'S DREAM was rated off the second flight outside a rival racing to the turn, split foes, then shifted three wide nearing upper stretch advancing to
challenge, was bumped, then exchanged contact with the eventual winner while shifting inwards racing into the lane but continued to press the issue outside
the top pair to late stages while just outkicked. ROJO TORO, slow into stride, settled well off the field on the backstretch, swung out four wide racing into
upper stretch to gain some position but made no real impact. FROLIC MAN, urged inside rivals disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn,
shifted out racing into upper stretch and gave way. SUMMER BOSS was prompted to cotend four wide in early stages, tracked off the first flight into the
bend, drifted out racing through the turn and gave way early. MINISTER QUINN broke outwards bumping the eventual winner, was hustled between foes
disputing the pace to the turn and was spent after a half.

Footnotes
LA CASTIGLIONE was urged inside rivals racing through the backstretch to dispute the pace, continued to press the issue in a prolonged drive to upper
stretch and edged forward late under firm handling. LETS TAKE IT IZZY broke readily to establish a narrow advantage between foes in the opening quarter,
disputed the lead outside a rival in a grudging effort racing past midstretch but was outfinished in late stages. LOVIN LIVIN tracked the leaders outside rivals
racing to the turn, shifted out four wide nearing the lane, altered course to split foes in the three path racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to
prevail for a share. BE BOP A LOLA, urged to a forward placing three deep stalking just off the leaders racing to the turn, drifted out nearing upper stretch
and gave way entering the lane. SIP'N DIP tracked off the first flight inside a rival racing into the turn, shifted out nearing the lane and faded into upper
stretch. GRANDMARY, off last, was settled off the second flight along the inside, saved ground through the bend but had no closing response.

Footnotes
SHAKEM N BREAKEM was pulling against light rating along the rail tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn,
shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch while being roused to advance, moved to wrest the advantage in late stages and held AYCAPOTE safe
under energetic handling. The latter raced three deep between foes into the first turn tracking just off the leaders, conceded some position under patient
handling to drop off the second flight on the backstretch, split foes advanced to contention on the far turn, angled four wide racing into upper stretch and
continued willingly to close the gap to the end. FREE FLAYME, urged to the lead from the outset while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow
advantage to the second bend, turned back a rival's challenge to go clear in upper stretch but couldn't fend off the top pair. UNSPOILED MOMENTS,
reserved last to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn and advanced inside foes while racing in close quarters late. MESA SKYLINE was rated off
the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out splitting rivals racing into upper stretch and finished evenly late. MITZRAYIM was urged
prompting the pacesetter from the outset, pressed the issue into the far turn and gave way nearing midstretch. THREEOHTWOCASSIE, caught four wide
racing into the first turn, tracked off the first flight outside rivals and gave way entering the far turn.

Footnotes
SPIRITUAL KING broke readily to gain a forward placing while angling inside the pacesetter to stalk that foe into the backstretch, tipped out after a half to
bid for command between foes racing into the far turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage shifting to the inside midway through the far turn, then
turned back ANALYZEYOURVISION in the closing stages to go clear under firm handling. The latter angled inwards racing to the first turn to track just off
the pacesetter outside the eventual winner, maintained terms with that foe to challenge for command three deep racing into the far turn, pressed the issue
outside the winner to midstretch but proved no match late. SETTE STELLE was rated outside rivals racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance
three wide leaving the far turn and continued willingly between foes in that path to narrowly prevail for a share. POSEIDONS MYTH, reserved along the
inside racing to the far turn, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to improve position. TOUR THE WORLD settled well off
the leaders racing to the backstretch, as prompted to advance while being fanned five wide into upper stretch but continued with interest while being just
outkicked for a share. DECEIVER was rated off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, steadily gained position racing into the far turn, shifted
inwards pursuing the leaders into upper stretch but emptied out in late stages. UNIQUE PATH angled to the rail tracking off the second flight in the opening
half but came up empty racing into the far turn. ZAGREB was off slowly and trailed the field to the stretch. DISTINCTIVE LAD was urged along the rail
setting the pace racing to the backstretch, then gave way once headed entering the far turn.

Footnotes
CHILLIN LADY angled to the inside stalking just off the pacesetter racing through the backstretch into the turn, shifted out three wide racing into upper
stretch while being prompted to advance, took over leaving the furlong marker and kicked clear under pressure. SPANISH DELIGHT, urged along pursuing
the pacesetter through the backstretch, moved to terms with that one pressing the issue on the turn, dueled for command to midstretch but couldn't match
the winner late. DARESCA, unhurried along the rail tracking the leaders as part of the second flight racing to the turn, swung out four wide racing into upper
stretch and continued with interest to close the gap while edging a rival for a share. TRULY AMBITIOUS, urged to the lead along the rail in the opening
quarter, dueled for command racing into the turn, couldn't match the top pair leaving the furlong marker and gave way. TRULY A DREAM tracked the
leaders between foes in second flight and continued evenly into the stretch. CASARENA HOTTIE proved no threat. DOES SHE KNOW tracked the leaders
outside foes in second flight in the opening quarter but retreated early.

CHESS MASTER was urged inside foes from the break disputing the lead, dueled for command into the turn, edged forward in upper stretch shifting a bit off
the inside and held JAZZY TIMES safe to the end under firm encouragement. The latter tracked just off the first flight between rivals racing to the turn,
angled to the rail midway through the bend and continued willingly inside the winner to challenge that rival late while failing to gain even terms. ABOUT
TODAY (ARG) angled inwards to join the the pace three wide, pressed the issue in that path past midstretch but was outfinished by the top pair. BABY
BOOMER tracked off the first flight four wide in early stages, shifted inwards entering the bend, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued
willingly to close the gap. FOX ROX settled last while avoiding a stricken rival, angled out six wide racing through upper stretch but made no real
impression. SHIP IT RED tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight, dropped back entering the turn, angled out five wide racing into the stretch but
offered no rally. MIAMI CROCKETT, urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way between foes in upper stretch. THE
CRITICAL WAY was pulled up in the opening stages, then was walked off the course following the race.

MOLLY'S ANGEL was rated inside foes tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening stages, eased back to last racing into the turn, shifted out nearing
upper stretch to advance between rivals, angled to the three path in upper stretch, then continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage and
go clear under firm handling. CLAY'S MOON STONE, in touch with the leaders three deep stalking the pace, shifted inwards pressing the issue outside a
rival on the turn, struck the front in upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner while narrowly prevailing for the place honors. SAY MOI urged between foes
disputing the pace, shifted to the inside dueling for command racing through the turn to upper stretch, couldn't contain the winner's bid but contested second
grudgingly to just miss the place honors. GRAMERCY tracked just off the first flight four wide racing to the turn, moved to challenge outside foes midway
through the turn, continued in the four path into the lane and lacked the needed final kick. HANNAH DANCES, urged inside foes disputing the pace from the
outset into the turn, gave way nearing the lane. STRIKING CHROME tracked off the first flight between foes under light rating in the opening stages, swung
out five wide racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed rally.

Footnotes
STYNER, off a bit slowly, was reserved well off the leaders just off the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance shifting outside foes
nearing the lane, angled out to race four wide between foes nearing midstretch and produced a solid late response to surge to the lead in time under strong
handling. MARV'S MAGIC, off a step slowly, was settled last racing to the backstretch, swung outside foes on the far turn to race five wide into upper stretch
and found his best stride in the closing stages to narrowly prevail for the place honors. MYSTERY BANK was rated out of striking distance near the inside
tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, continued inside foes into the stretch, then advanced along the rail in the closing stages to challenge for
command but was outkicked by the top pair. ROBINSON tracked off the first flight from out of striking distance outside a rival in the opening half, was
prompted to advance on the leaders three deep racing into the far turn, moved to challenge for command in that path between rivals leaving midstretch but
lost some momentum when racing in tight quarters nearing the wire. PIRATE PARADE, forwardly placed along the rail in the opening stages, switched
outside the pacesetter tracking that foe on the backstretch, advanced to press the issue on the far turn to midstretch but yielded in late stages. THAT
QUALITY was urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the first turn, gained the advantage while shifting to the inside on the backstretch, dictated
the pace to the second bend, dueled inside a rival to midstretch but faltered leaving the furlong marker. BIG PERM tracked off the second flight outside foes
in the opening half, made some brief progress shifted four wide nearing upper stretch but came up empty racing past midstretch. KICK IT CHARLIE tracked
off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch but faded early. OSPREY raced behind the second flight along the inside and retreated after a
half.

Footnotes
DREAM LINER (BRZ) was reserved between foes in the last flight to the backstretch, shifted out four wide splitting rivals after a half, then produced a
steady rally three deep racing into the lane to wrest command and go clear under firm handling. VINTNER, reserved between foes in the last flight to the
first turn, switched outside foes on the backstretch pulling his way along three deep with an early move to challenge for command on the far turn, moved to
gain the advantage in upper stretch but proved no match. GOLOVKIN, urged forcing a rival's pace racing to the first turn, gained the advantage and set the
pace to the second bend, but gave way midstretch when failing to match the top pair. STUNNING BABY tracked off the first flight along the inside, was
shuffled back in traffic racing into the far turn, shifted out nearing the lane and improved position between foes. FARM STRONG settled last to the
backstretch, raced five wide into the stretch but made no real impact. SARASOTA BOY tracked outside foes in second flight and faded between foes into
the lane. STRONG ENDING tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch and came up empty racing into the far turn. THROWN FOR A
LOUPE, settled along the inside, was pulling against restraint, then steadied off rivals nearing the backstretch and proved no threat thereafter.
DRAMATIZED, urged prompting a rival's pace while shifting to the inside, was through after a half. I SAY I PLAY tracked off the second flight in early
stages, was prompted to advance while swinging out four wide nearing the lane, swerved out sharply entering upper stretch, dislodging his rider.
FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF GOLOVKIN LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF VINTER WHILE THE STEWARDS ALSO
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN UPPER STRETCH, BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
