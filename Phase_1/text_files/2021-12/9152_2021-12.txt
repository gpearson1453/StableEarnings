Footnotes
LOVE NEST moved up inside to duel along the rail first turn, continued to alternate up front the middle half, disposed of the other speed turning for home to
be clear upper stretch, steadily increased advantage while kept to pressure. HEIRLOOM KITTEN settled in the second flight while off the inside, dropped to
the rail late in the final turn when moving a bit closer, could do little with the winner the final furlong, edging clear for the second spot. COACH ADAMS off a
step slow, moved out to race 4w into first turn, remained in the second flight up the backstretch, moved closer in the three path with just over a quarter mile
to run, flattened out a bit in the drive. TIZ SHOWBIZ in mid pack while racing off the inside, three to four wide when making a mild advance exiting the
second turn, also hung in the drive. IKE broke alertly, dueled up front in the two path, alternated in the run up the backstretch, first to blink entering the
stretch. SHAKE IT raced in mid pack toward the inside, had little for the drive. ISTILLGOTIT off a step slow, raced outside and was never a threat.
BAQUERO FLIES bobbled to be off slow and last away, remained back while saving ground.

Footnotes
BEVERLY PARK broke sharp, sprinted clear in the two path, continued to hold a sizable advantage through the turn while in the two path, roused inside the
furlong grounds when that advantage began to diminish, all out to last while drifting a bit in the final strides. SACRED OATH void of speed, remained back
through the turn, saved ground into the lane, made a late run while remaining toward the rail, rapidly getting to the winner. CALIFORNIA SWING last away,
staged a mild middle move into the stretch, failed to sustain that advance in the drive. HIDDEN RULER chased the winner for five furlongs in vain in the
three path, little left late.

Footnotes
OPUS EQUUS brushed at the break, raced well back for a half, swung out five wide turning for home, late surge while widest to be up in time. SPECIAL
PRYCE void of speed, three wide into the lane while between rivals, steered in past the furlong marker, finished up willingly to miss while closest to the rail
of the top flight. SHACKS WAY broke in, was straightened to race closest to the leader for a half, took over while being floated out a bit turning for home,
took over soon after, led late, caught in the late going. LATIN CASINO pushed in at the start, 2nd flight, five wide into the lane when moving a bit closer,
came up empty in the drive. KOSHER COWBOY broke alertly, cleared early toward the inside, came out a bit late in the turn when continuing to lead, gave
way soon after when headed. THE FEATURE crowded back at the start, failed to menace in remaining back. MAJOR CHANCE in mid pack early, tired
while three wide. FALLEN EMPIRE forwardly placed early, began a steady fade along the inside before a half.

EMPERADOR with the early pace on the outside, vied five wide into the lane, came three wide into the lane, headed with less than a furlong remaining,
battled back in game fashion. GO WEST with the pace along the inside, continued to do battle in the first flight into the lane while remaining closest to the
inside, put a head in front late, outkicked. STRATOFORTRESS contested the pace while between foes and inside the winner, remained between the top
two turning for home, could not match strides with that pair to the wire, comfortably saved the show. CONSTITUTIONAL LAW raced in mid pack while
toward the inside, behind traffic midway on the bend, asked along late in the turn, continued evenly through the stretch. LATE NITE RADIO off a step slow,
fell back steadily in the run up the backstretch, four wide into the lane, improved position with some mild late interest. VICTORY MARCH off slowly, raced
back, moved somewhat closer in the run through the turn, bothered slightly in upper stretch by a drifting, LEAGUE OF LEGENDS, flattened out in the drive.
LEAGUE OF LEGENDS with the early pace while between rivals, gave way in the turn, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, continued to tire. WHEELS off step
slow, back off the pace along the inside, steadied early in the turn, remained back. AMAZING ROCKET forced the issue from between horses early,
stopped in the turn.

Footnotes
SUBSTANTIAL off a step slow and was shuffled, void of speed, enjoyed a good trip along the inside when improving position, rail bid, late, found more in
the final strides to narrowly prevail in game fashion. JOHNNY UNLEASHED forwardly placed early while outside, closer three out to four wide and between
horses into the lane, late bid, hung. SHOTSKI void of speed, roused when three wide into the lane, challenged between the top two with a sixteenth of a
mile remaining, narrowly missed the nod for the place. STURGILL broke out, set the early pace outside, floated out to be three wide into the lane,
weakened. LONG TERM THINKING behind the pace well out in the strip, carried out five wide into the lane, weakened through the lane. MUCH BETTER
pressed the issue early along the inside, got out a bit to be in the two path turning for home and backed up. LAMARTINE (BRZ) was finished early.

ONE TEN STADIUM in the second flight off the inside, in traffic through the turn, angled out four wide turning for home, challenged while widest inside the
furlong marker, drove well clear. WHERE'S RANDY off a step slow, used to move up and become a forward factor by late backstretch, shuffled back
through the turn when lacking room, two path and behind horses into lane, blocked several times while possessing good energy mid to late stretch, steered
out, finished willingly when finally clear to be up for the place. WHELEN SPRINGS in mid pack early outside, moved to challenge four wide midway on the
turn, vied past the furlong marker, flattened out a bit in the late going to be caught for the place. RAZO broke back, raced off the early pace out in the strip,
moved closer five wide and between horses in the turn, traffic, brush deep stretch and weakened. ALLO ENRY broke out, pressed outside, two path and
between horses into the lane, had little left in the late going. MAX'S HEART broke alertly, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch, continued to vie turn,
faltered. ALL IN GOOD TIME void of speed, moved closer in the turn while dropping to the inside, was no dangerous in the drive. STREET COMMANDER
broke back, five wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. PEACE DOG off a step slow, remained always back. PACIFIC
HARBOR pressed the issue early toward the inside, gave way in the drive. FULL BUCK MOON fell back after the start and trailed throughout in showing
little.

the place. SONNEMAN in the second flight while racing along the inside, came up empty for the drive. BEAVER HAT settled off the pace, moved closer in
the final turn, flattened out in the drive. GUEST SUITE fell back to trail soon after the start, saved ground first turn, angled out to be four wide turning for
home when roused, failed to muster a closing kick. CASH LOGISTICS broke out and a step slow, moved up to race closest to the winner before a quarter,
chased that one the middle half and faltered in the final bend.

Footnotes
NAMESAKE away in good order, set the early pace inside, rated in the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground through the final turn, shook clear
in upper stretch, kept to task the final furlong. CAPTAIN FANTASTIC settled off the early pace, four wide into the far turn, came three wide into the lane,
proved no match for the winner, drew clear for the place. HOLIDAY TICKET within striking distance off the inside, moved closer in the three path and
between the top two in the second turn, could not keep pace in the stretch, clear of the others. SALADO back off the early pace, moved closer in hand
before a half, remained in a forward position through the second turn, had little left for the stretch run. SAQEEL void of speed, three to four wide turning for
home, improved position through the stretch a bit, no real threat. RIVER REDEMPTION lacked early speed, never menaced. MY FAVORITE UNCLE jostled
soon after the start, trailed most of the way in failing to threaten. BRODY BOUCHER pressed the winner from the two path then gave way in the second
turn. ROULETTE rank in the first turn when in the second flight, stopped after a half, far back.

LAST SAMURAI forwardly placed along the inside early after breaking in good order, moved out three wide backstretch, advanced late final turn, outside bid
upper stretch, set down, edging away late while displaying some solid mettle. SUPER STOCK forwardly placed in the two path first turn, continued to stalk
through the second bend while saving ground, edged out and challenged between horses nearing midstretch, could not match the winner late, held sway for
the place. FLASH OF MISCHIEF broke on top, set a soft pace along the inside, remained clear in the second turn, offered brief resistance to the top two
nearing midstretch then gave in. DEFEATER off a step slow, raced back inside, moved out, three wide into the lane when making a mild advance, went
evenly to the wire. RAM fell back to trail after the start, steered out turning for home, lacked a closing punch. MYOPIC chased those soft fractions off the
inside, two path, had little left for the stretch run. SIMOVITCH was finished early.

turning for home, slight drift, held late under brisk handling. OTTOTHELEGEND also raced back off the pace, moved closer toward the inside while
maneuvering around a faltering rival midway on the final turn, traffic into the stretch, lacked room and altered course toward the inside and finished willingly
when clear. PHANTOM DANCE void of early foot off the inside, came four wide out of the final turn, turned in a mild rally to annex the show. GIGGING
broke back, lacked speed, continued to lag the middle half, swung out five wide turning for home, turned in a belated rally to improve position. MIACOMET
broke out, used a bit from the outside to duel into the first turn, helped set a rapid set of early fractions, weakened in the drive. CONTINENTAL COINS
chased the quick duel just off the inside, had little left for the stretch run. QUARTERBACK DAK unprepared for the start, raced back along the inside, moved
out, came four wide into the stretch, improved slightly while not a serious threat. DON'TSHOWWEAKNESS settled off the early pace, moved a bit closer in
the final turn, gave way in the drive. MR. TIP remained back while racing four wide much of the way. PALACE COUP broke on top, dueled through some
quick fractions, stopped second turn, distanced through the stretch after losing contact with the field.
