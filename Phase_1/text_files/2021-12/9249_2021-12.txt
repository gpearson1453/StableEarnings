SPECIAL BEACH stalked the pace from the inside into the turn, shifted out nearing the quarter pole, dug in determinedly three wide through deep stretch
under left handed urging and was along in time. LA MUNECA broke in front, set all the pace and just missed hanging on. DUDES LAWYER chased the
early pace, loomed boldly two wide midway on the turn, matched strides until deep stretch then was outfinished. CARDIOVERSION hopped at the start and
closed a gap late in the five path. NOMBRE bobbled at the start and failed to menace. DREAM TO WIN was outrun. NATALIA'S TEMPLE was through
early.
