rail on the turn, was put to the crop in the two path at the quarter-pole, shook clear in upper stretch and proved best under strong urging. LONG TERM
stumbled at the start but broke with the field, settled just off the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch
under the crop and secured the place while unable to go with the winner. RHUMJAR pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn,
dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and weakened but held the show. BRAILLE settled off the pace, was asked in the two path on the turn and
lacked the needed response. UNION LIGHTS was hustled from the start then urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn and failed to respond.
FENWICK broke in then bumped with a foe and was off a step slow, moved up inside under urging, saved ground on the turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
AUTUMN GLORY was rated while saving ground, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied outside to make a bid nearing the eighth-pole, fought with the
runner-up in the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. ROBYN AND ELI tracked the pace on the outside in the two path, turned up the pressure on
the leader around the far turn, took the advantage into upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong, fought on well when headed by the winner but
missed while able to get the place. I'LL GO ALL IN was taken in hand early then rated on the inside, shifted three wide into the stretch, moved out in pursuit
of the leader, bumped lightly with a foe outside the furlong marker and finished willingly for the show. CAPE COD CAUSEWAY was taken under a tight hold
early, went four wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under urging while two then three wide on the far turn and lacked the needed kick.
DREAM CENTRAL bumped with a rival at the start, saved ground on the first turn, settled near the back, was roused in the two path on the final turn, came
three wide into the stretch then moved further out and improved position. SWEET LIES was taken under a tight hold early, went three wide around the
opening bend, was reserved off the pace, traveled three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to rally.
FALSE HOPE went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, tucked into the two path around the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed response. VALENTIA ISLAND rounded the first turn in the three path, settled just off the pace on the outside, was given he cue in the two
path on the far turn, chased into upper stretch then moved out, bumped lightly with a foe outside the furlong marker then drifted in and came up empty.
REGAL REBEL went to the front, set the pace on the inside, was asked under threat late on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path then lost the
lead before the three-sixteenths and gave way. SHE'S A NATURAL traveled around the first turn in the three path, settled off the pace, saved ground on the
far turn and failed to threaten. CARA'S DAYDREAMER bumped with a rival at the start, went four wide on the turns and failed to respond. STERLING
MISTRESS saved ground on both turns and was no factor.

Footnotes
KUMAR broke alertly then was hustled, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside to the two path on the turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch,
responded well in the final furlong and was fully extended to last. SUPREME AURA was bumped on both sides at the start then pinched back, moved out
early then settled towards the rear, went five then six wide on the turn, rallied outside while still on his inside lead in the stretch and just missed while up for
the place. DIRECT ORDER was well placed just off the pace, came under urging while two to three wide on the turn, chased into the final furlong, swapped
back to his inside lead outside the sixteenth-pole, gained on the winner late and just missed while clear for the show. SICILIA MIKE bumped with a rival at
the start, tracked the pace, vied three to four wide on the turn, chased on his inside lead into the final furlong and weakened. LEGIT raced well back in the
field, went around the turn in the two path and failed to rally. REGAL QUALITY was lightly rated on the outside, chased four to five wide on the turn and
came up empty. O SHEA CAN U SEE broke in and bumped with a foe, settled at the rear, went four wide early on the turn then shifted six wide and was no
factor. AMERICAN LINCOLN was urged along just off the pace, dropped back three wide on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
MARKETSEGMENTATION settled nicely on the inside, drafted along the rail on the far turn, was roused while swinging out into upper stretch, accelerated
to the front at the three-sixteenths and powered clear to prove much the best in an excellent debut. ETHERIC settled on the inside, was roused on the far
turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and finished with good courage for the place. WILLAKIA was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths,
saved ground under reserve at the back, was held up in the two path at the five-sixteenths, shifted four wide while roused at the quarter-pole then tipped to
the six path at the three-sixteenths and improved to just get the show while flattening out in the final furlong. EVER SUMMER jostled with a rival early,
settled on the inside, swung five wide into the stretch, drifted in late and just missed the show. FOR THE FLAG went to the front, set the pace on the inside,
was asked late on the far turn, lost the lead to the winner in upper stretch and weakened. ROSEBUG rounded the first turn in the two path, settled near the
middle of the field, went four wide on the far turn, jostled with a foe into the stretch and lacked the needed response. EMPRESS AT WAR jostled with a rival
early then was taken up some, went two to three wide on the turns, swung seven wide into the stretch, drifted in around the furlong marker and failed to
rally. ACE GIRL ducked out at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the far turn, came six wide into
the stretch and failed to threaten. MISS INVINCIBLE went three wide around the opening turn, settled towards the front, tracked three wide on the far turn,
was asked late on that bend, jostled with a foe into the stretch and had nothing left. HARD PLACE was taken under a tight hold early, prompted the pace on
the outside in the two path, was asked on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
CARPE'S DREAM showed good speed, set the pace under some pressure, vied in the two path on the turn, responded well when put to the crop in upper
stretch and held under strong urging. URBAN FOREST bumped with a rival at the start then drifted in, was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the
turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and was second best. FIERY HEART settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, raced inside to the
two path on the turn, moved out then bumped with a foe in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while just able to get the show. STJAMES bumped with
a rival at the start and was off a bit slow then dropped back, was urged along well off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path and improved to just miss
the show. KING OF HOLLYWOOD settled near the middle of the field, was roused three wide on the turn, bumped with rivals on both sides in upper stretch
and just missed the show. KOBE'S LEGACY settled outside under some urging, went four then five wide on the turn, was bumped lightly and forced out in
upper stretch then lacked the needed kick. CHUCKA MOON was off slow, raced at the rear under urging, went three to four wide on the turn, moved out
near the sixteenth-pole and gained ground but failed to threaten. PIPITO showed speed then dropped just off the pace, saved ground on the turn and came
up empty. U KANT WHIP IT disputed the pace on the far outside, was guided around the turn under extra left-rein pressure, moved from the four path to the
two path on that bend and capitulated. R DOC settled under some urging, raced inside to the two path on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and
failed to respond.

drive outside the eighth-pole, extended the advantage into the final furlong, drew off under two pops of a left-handed crop to the sixteenth-pole then was
eased up while much the best. BELLA VITA bobbled at the start then bumped lightly with a rival, tracked the pace down the backstretch, went three wide on
the turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths then driven five wide into upper stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. TRUTH
HURTS brushed with a foe just after the start, was well placed just off the pace, raced in the two path for most of the turn then dropped to the rail, was
roused outside the quarter-pole and came up empty while best of the rest. SHARP STARR brushed with an opponent shortly after the start, settled on the
outside, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch and had nothing left. HONOR WAY bumped lightly with a foe at the start then dropped
back, angled in at the rear leaving the chute, was urged along in the two then three path early on the turn, moved to four then five wide late on that bend,
was fanned seven wide into upper stretch and failed to respond. MISS MARISSA moved out while showing speed on the inside of the winner then pressed
the pace, came up empty while inside early on the turn, moved out later on that bend and retreated.

MO DONEGAL bumped with a rival at the start, was well placed just off the pace while inside to the two path, swung five wide over heels while roused
coming to the quarter-pole, rallied outside to take the lead outside the furlong marker, moved in closer to the runner-up under a right-handed crop at the
sixteenth-pole, had the rider put the crop away and throw repeated exaggerated crosses with the left-rein near the face of the runner-up and narrowly
prevailed while bumping with that foe near the wire. ZANDON tracked the pace on the outside in the three path, was given his cue on the far turn, rallied to
the lead in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner before the eighth-pole, dug in gamely on the inside in the final furlong, had the winner's rider
attempt to intimidate him late then bumped approaching the wire and just missed in a determined effort. MIDNIGHT CHROME prompted the pace on the
outside of the leader in the two path, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, drew even midway through the far turn then took the advantage at the
five-sixteenths, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and weakened but just held the show. MR JEFFERSON went four wide on the first turn, was
reserved on the outside, came under urging leaving the backstretch, chased four wide on the final turn and came up empty. ELOQUIST was last away while
crowded some at the start, angled in while dropping back early, saved ground at the rear, was urged along passing the five-eighths, raced inside for most of
the far turn then moved out, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. WHO HOO THATS ME bumped with a foe at the start, rounded the first
turn in the three path, settled off the pace, was asked near the seven-sixteenths, moved from the two path to the four path under urging around the final
bend and capitulated. FROMANOTHAMUTHA went to the front, set the pace on the inside through tepid fractions, was asked under heavy threat just inside
the three-eighths, lost the advantage prior to the five-sixteenths and faded. JUDGE DAVIS was taken in hand early, traveled three wide around the first turn,
was reserved off the pace, went four then five wide under urging on the far turn and failed to respond. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE
STRETCH RUN, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

AMERICANREVOLUTION settled just off the pace, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, went two then three wide under strong encouragement on
the turn, was driven into upper stretch, bumped with a foe inside the three-sixteenths, made a bid near the furlong marker, took the lead into the final
sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. FOLLOWING SEA moved up to get the lead, set the pace on the inside through solid fractions, was asked with
five-sixteenths to run then headed at the quarter-pole, fought back gamely inside of foes and regained the lead, was headed by the winner into the final
sixteenth and missed while clear for the place. PLAINSMAN was hard held off the pace, came under urging while moving from the inside to the two path on
the turn, moved out into upper stretch, bumped with a rival inside the three-sixteenths, chased between horses into the final furlong, steadied briefly while in
tight at the sixteenth-pole and safely secured the show while unable to go with the top two. OLYMPIAD had INDEPENDENCE HALL clip his heels outside
the three-quarter pole, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked three then four wide on the turn then driven six wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed response. CODE OF HONOR settled at the rear of the field, was roused two then three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, drifted out
in the vicinity of the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. GINOBILI prompted the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the two path on the turn,
took a short advantage at the quarter-pole, battled on even terms for the lead while under a drive into the final furlong and tired. INDEPENDENCE HALL
clipped heels outside the three-quarter pole, was reserved off the pace, came under urging near the seven-sixteenths, went three to four wide on the turn,
turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to threaten. PIPELINE veered out at the start, settled on the outside, was asked while four then five wide
on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and faltered. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, NO CHANGE WAS MADE
