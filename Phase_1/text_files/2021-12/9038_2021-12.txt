Footnotes
BLUE TIMES strolled to the front then was taken under a snug hold, went around the first turn in the two path, was well rated while in hand, controlled the
action while let out along the rail on the far turn, was roused in the two path into upper stretch, responded well under a strong hand ride in the final furlong
and maintained a safe advantage under good handling. MOZAY pulled under restraint while keen early, was rated just off the pace on the inside, came
under urging midway through the far turn, swung three wide into upper stretch, pursued the winner to the wire and finished willingly for the place.
INVESTMENT INCOME was taken up while very rank off heels after leaving the chute, saved ground around the opening bend, settled more kindly on the
backstretch, was roused in the two path on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. EXCEPT
TEMPTATION established a forward position early, rounded the first turn in the three path, tracked the pace on the outside, was urged along late on the
backstretch, chased in the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and weakened. PRUNING steadied off heels while very rank after
leaving the chute, traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled more kindly on the backstretch, was given her cue in the three path on the far turn,
came four wide into the stretch and had nothing left. EXOTIC CAT saved ground while unhurried at the rear, was urged along on the far turn and failed to
threaten. OUR SWEET PEA navigated the first turn in the two path, was reserved on the outside, went three wide under urging on the far turn, floated five
wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
A MO REAY brushed with a rival at the start, prompted the pace on the outside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, vied in the three path under
strong encouragement on the turn, took the lead into the stretch, shook clear nearing the furlong marker and proved best under strong urging. KHULUQ
showed the way down the backstretch, was asked in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner into the stretch and was outfinished but kept
on well to be well clear for the place. AMBASSADOR KELLY settled off the pace, moved closer with five furlongs to run, was roused in the two path on the
turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened while best of the rest. EARLY GLOW broke out at the start, showed speed towards the inside, dropped
back inside the three-quarter pole, continued to fall towards the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn and capitulated. GLAMOROUS DAYS brushed
with a foe at the start, settled outside under some urging, moved closer with five furlongs to run, chased in the four path through the turn and capitulated.
CHASING ARTEMIS settled under some urging, went two to three wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
PURE PANIC was hustled from the start, contested the pace on the inside of HEZASTONECOLDFOX while head to head with that rival, vied along the rail
while continuing to be hounded on the turn, had OURAIKA take a short advantage in upper stretch, dug in resolutely while battling inside that foe, regained
the lead in the final sixteenth and gamely prevailed in a big effort. OURAIKA (FR) bumped with a rival at the start, settled on the outside, went four wide on
the turn, gained coming to the quarter-pole, took a short lead in upper stretch, fought outside of the winner, lost the advantage back to that foe in the final
sixteenth and was denied while able to get the place. MIDNIGHT WORKER was away alertly then hustled, chased the pace down the backstretch, was
taken under restraint while pocketed in the two path on the turn, shifted four wide while asked at the quarter-pole, pursued the top two to the wire and
finished willingly for the show. COOL LAOBAN was coaxed along off the pace, moved closer late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, pursued the
top two under a drive in the stretch and lacked the needed kick then missed the show. OPEN TIL MIDNIGHT broke a bit slow, was urged along near the
back, saved ground for most of the turn, shifted three wide outside the quarter-pole, brushed with a foe while swinging six wide into the stretch and was no
factor. OUR TINY DANCER bumped with a foe at the start and was off a step slow, went three wide for most of the turn then shifted four wide, rubbed
saddles with a foe while carried seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. NOT YET CHARLIE broke out at the start, settled on the outside, chased
three wide on the turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch and came up empty. HEZASTONECOLDFOX disputed the pace on the outside of the winner,
vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
VIOLENT VIXEN broke very fast, set the early pace then contested the lead, vied along the rail on the turn, scooted clear into upper stretch, drew off into
the final furlong and proved much the best while kept to the task under a brisk hand ride. AUNT NAUGHTY was urged along off the pace, went two to three
wide on the turn, was carried six wide into upper stretch and secured the place while no match for the winner. DEFAULT PROTECTION broke in then
bumped with a foe and was off a step slow, was urged along off the pace, raced inside for most of the turn then shifted to the two path, swung five wide into
upper stretch and just got up for the show. HEELS TOGETHER bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, went around the turn in the two path and
lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. OUR JESSICA broke a half-step slow, was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn and
came up empty. INTENSE HONOR settled on the inside, was roused while saving ground on the turn and also came up empty. RHOMBIQUE was ridden
along at the back, went three wide on the turn, dropped to the two path into the stretch and failed to respond. MADAME ROSE moved up on the outside to
contest the pace, vied in the three path on the turn and faded.

SWEET MISSION went three wide on the first turn, settled on the far outside, traveled four wide on the far turn, was roused five wide into the stretch, rallied
outside into the final furlong, closed fast into the final sixteenth, bumped with KEMBA about seventy yards from the wire and got up to prevail. KEMBA went
three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved from three to four wide on the far turn, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong, made a
bid outside the sixteenth-pole, bumped with SWEET MISSION about seventy yards from the wire and was denied while just able to get the place.
PERHAPS TONIGHT (IRE) became keen when taken under a strong hold early, went three wide around the opening bend, stalked the pace on the outside
under vigorous restraint, raced three wide on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, moved out while chasing the leader, altered in from behind that foe
around the furlong marker, gained into the final sixteenth and just missed while narrowly able to get the show. A RING THING shifted out early, raced in the
three path on the first turn, moved up to contest the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, came out while inching clear in upper stretch,
led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught and just missed the trifecta. LOOKIN TO FLY broke a step slow, saved ground at the rear, was
urged along on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch, rallied in the final furlong and closed strongly to just miss the superfecta. EMPTY NET bumped hard
with a rival at the start, was rated on the inside under a strong hold, moved a bit off the rail while let out on the far turn, was asked for her best in upper
stretch and lacked the needed kick. SUDDEN IMPULSE was reserved on the inside, shifted three wide late on the far turn and lacked the needed response.
EVIDENCE BASED broke a step slow, saved ground on the turns and gained ground but failed to menace. ADRIATIC ROSE broke in at the start, saved
ground on the first turn, settled in the back half of the field, traveled three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch then moved further out and
failed to threaten. APPRECIATE bumped hard with a foe at the start, was placed under a hard hold early, went four wide on the first turn, was reserved
towards the back, went four wide under urging on the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. ATHENA DANCER bumped hard with
foes on both sides at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was urged five wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch
and was no factor. PROPER GRAMMAR went to the front then moved clear early, set the pace on the inside, was challenged on the backstretch, lost the

Footnotes
LOST MY SOCK was urged along on the inside, moved to the two path under a left-handed crop in upper stretch, pursued the runner-up into the final
sixteenth and got up under strong urging. GLITTER UP showed the way down the backstretch, came out a bit into the turn then quickly dropped back to the
rail, responded well when asked for her best in upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth but was denied while clear for the place. CHAMPAGNE POETRY
broke in and brushed with a foe, settled off the pace, steadied while in tight between foes in the four path midway through the turn, shifted five wide shortly
thereafter and improved to get the show. CANDY LIGHT broke out and brushed with a foe, chased the pace down the backstretch, checked in traffic in the
two path early on the turn then shifted three wide, bumped hard with a foe late on that bend and was taken up then lacked the needed kick while able to get
the last spot in the superfecta. DREAM NORTH was sent hard from the start, chased the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn and weakened.
REINA DE LA ROSE broke in then bumped with a foe and was last away, moved in while urged along at the rear, saved ground for most of the turn, shifted
four wide outside the quarter-pole and failed to threaten. RACING QUEEN settled on the outside, went five wide on the turn and came up empty. SWEET

lacked the needed response. BIG BEAN CHRISTINE brushed with an opponent at the start, pressed the pace under urging, vied in the two path on the turn,
bumped hard with foes on both sides late on that bend then checked and capitulated. MARTINI'S AMICA was urged along off the pace, raced inside to the
two path on the turn, bumped hard with a foe against the rail inside the five-sixteenths then checked very sharply and lost all chance. FOLLOWING A

Footnotes
SARATOGA PAL dropped well behind under urging, traveled around the turn in the two path, rallied five wide into the stretch and closed strongly to get up
late. BIG BOBBY was urged along on the outside, went around the turn in the five path, passed the five-sixteenths under the crop, dropped to the four path
nearing the quarter-pole, bumped with MONEY IN THE BACK while keeping that foe in behind horses in upper stretch, made an outside bid near the furlong
marker, gained the lead outside the sixteenth-pole but was caught while able to get the place. BRONX BOMBER broke a half-step slow, settled under some
urging, saved ground on the turn, came out into the stretch, waited while blocked from the three-sixteenths to the furlong marker, found room between
horses then was asked shortly thereafter and finished willingly for the show. MONEY IN THE BANK settled just off the pace, went three wide on the turn,
was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, bumped with BIG BOBBY while attempting to get out from behind foes in upper stretch, altered to the outside
around the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. GOLD PANDA tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the four path on the turn, dropped to
three path near the quarter-pole, fought between horses into the final furlong and weakened. WINNERS LAUGH was hustled from the start, pressed the
pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, dropped to the two path near the quarter-pole, battled between foes into the final furlong and tired.
STEAM ENGINE set the pace on the inside under pressure, was asked at the five-sixteenths, battled under a drive into the final furlong and gave way.

CREA'S BKLYN LAW moved out to avoid the fallen rider near the five-eighths, went four then five wide on the turn, rallied six wide into the stretch and
closed strongly in the middle of the track to get up late. GRAN CASIQUE angled in with abandon and bumped RAGTIME BLUES at the five-eighths and
bumped him hard which caused that foe to lose his rider, inherited a clear lead at that point, went around the turn in the three path, was asked for his best in
upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while able to get the place. SPEEDING KID settled off the pace, dropped from the four path to the
two path early on the turn, was roused three wide into upper stretch, chased the runner-up into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked while clear for the
show. HEAVY ROLLER moved out early, shifted out to avoid the fallen rider near the five-eighths, went three wide on the turn, came four to five wide into
the stretch and gained some ground but failed to threaten. NEXT FLIGHT settled on the far outside, was urged five wide on the turn and lacked the needed
response. CAUSE OF ACTION moved out to avoid the fallen jockey near the five-eighths pole, went around the turn in the two path and failed to rally.
JOYCEE HAZ PIZZAZ chased the pace down the backstretch then in the four path on the turn and tired. RAGTIME BLUES moved in early while showing
speed, was bumped hard by GRAN CASIQUE as that foe came in at the five-eighths then unseated the rider. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY,
GRAN CASIQUE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED LAST FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE FIVE-EIGHTHS POLE. FRACTIONS
ADDED AND FINAL TIME CHANGED FOLLOWING VIDEO REVIEW.

SUMMER TO REMEMBER was hustled from the start then taken under a hold early, stalked the pace on the outside in the two path, took the lead with a
half-mile to run, shook clear leaving the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the two path, responded well under a drive in upper stretch and held under
strong urging. SMILE BRYAN went two to three wide on the first turn, settled towards the front, was asked three wide on the far turn, chased the winner into
the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth but missed while clear for the place. VETTORI KIN (BRZ) saved ground on both turns, turned into upper
stretch under a drive and improved position for the show. BATTALION rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, moved from the two
path to the four path under urging on the final turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and also improved position but failed to threaten. MO READY saved
ground around the opening bend, settled off the pace, was urged three wide on the far turn then driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. KING'S HONOR (IRE) moved in while under a snug hold early, was rated on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, dropped back into
upper stretch and had nothing left. JACK THE CAT saved ground on the turns and was no factor. ARTEMUS BRIDGE went around both turns in the two
path and showed little. MATTY'S EXPRESS rounded the first turn in the two path, was rated off the pace, moved out from behind cover late on the
backstretch, went four wide on the far turn and came up empty. SPECTATORLESS went to the front, set the pace on the inside, lost the lead with a
half-mile to run, dropped back into the far turn and stopped.

Footnotes
SHE'S THE ONE settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied on the outside, closed fast to get the
lead inside the furlong marker then moved clear under good handling. UNCLE'S GEM settled just off the pace, tucked into the two path on the turn, gained
to make a bid between horses near the furlong marker but was outfinished while able to get the place. MASTEROF THE TUNES settled off the pace, saved
ground on the turn, came off the rail into the stretch, was urged behind foes past the three-sixteenths, lacked room behind horses passing the furlong
marker, altered out around the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly for the show. HIGHWAY QUEEN was well placed just off the pace, chased inside on the
turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, made a bid between horses outside the furlong marker but was out-kicked. SNICKET pressed the pace on the
outside then in the three path on the turn, took the lead into upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong then was overtaken. MASHNEE GIRL
settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch, reached a reasonable striking range before the furlong marker but lacked
the needed response. CANDY MONET settled well back in the field, went around the turn in mostly the two path and failed to threaten. ANCIENT BROWN
broke a bit slow, settled towards the rear on the outside, went four to five wide on the turn and was no factor. CAUMSETT set the pace under pressure from
the outside, vied inside to the two path on the turn, lost the lead into upper stretch and gave way. WRITE THIS DOWN broke a step slow, settled towards
the back, went three wide on the turn and failed to respond.
