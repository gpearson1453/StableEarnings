Footnotes
LORD DRAGON outrun in the early going just off the inside, began a four wide advance into the far turn, took over three wide turning for home, kicked well
clear under pressure. AWESOME SATURDAY in the second flight toward the inside, raced firmly in hand in traffic through much of the second bend,
steered out three wide and between horses for room exiting the bend, proved no match for the winner in the drive, held sway late for the place. CANADIAN
GAME lacked early foot inside, continued to save ground into the far turn, angled out four wide turning for home, finished willingly to be closing the gap on
the runner up. COLOSI evenly paced off the inside, continued outside in the run up the backstretch, was five wide into the lane when advancing, flattened
out in the final furlong. PIT BOSS broke alertly, dueled up front off the inside, continued to alternate into the far turn, began to weaken soon after, continued
giving way through the stretch. FAY DAN alternated up front while closest to the inside, also faltered in the second turn. MOROCCO fractious in the gate,
settled in mid pack, shuffled back in some traffic far turn, continued to fade stretch. KNIGHT'S CROSS chased the dueling leaders early, began a steady
retreat before a half.

Footnotes
DOC IRWIN back off the early pace toward the inside, began to advance along the rail late turn, angled out sharply four wide turning for home, split rivals
past the furlong marker, took over, drove clear. LORD M bumped just after the break, recovered, raced forwardly off the inside, floated out to be five wide
turning for home, could not match strides with that one the final furlong, held the place. RISKY SITUATION in mid pack early while toward the inside, moved
out to be four wide turning into the stretch, staged a mild rally to finish up best of the rest. LOU'S ARROW in the second flight, raced one paced through the
turn in the two path, lacked a closing punch. CYBER MONDAY back off the pace, came five wide into the lane, improved position slightly while not a serious
threat. ROLL DINERO ROLL came out early to brush with a rival, was quickly straightened to clear early, continued to show the way through the turn, got
out late in the bend carrying the runner up out, began to weaken soon after. MACHO APPEAL within striking distance along the inside, came up empty for
the stretch run. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY off a step slow, remained back in failing to threaten. DANCIN ROCKET in tight, bumped just after the break, within
striking distance for a half, backed up through the lane. PURE IRON off slow, pinched and then steadied, dropped inside for the drive, saved ground,
remained back. OTHER TIMES dwelt at the start, far back, never close. CHIKI BOY finished early while four wide through the turn, well back.

well clear. GRAND DESIGN dueled up front in the two path, put the other speed away into the far turn, briefly clear, raced on equal terms with the winner
upper stretch then could not keep up, clearly second best. CAN IMAGINE dueled up front closest to the inside, fell back off the runner up into the far turn,
continued to weaken slightly, comfortably saved the show. GEORGIA DEPUTY off a step slow, raced well back for six furlongs, two path into the lane,
rallied through traffic to improve position. FLATOUT WINNER within striking distance while off the inside, came up empty for the drive. RIVER FINN in mid
pack while racing three wide, angled out to be four wide turning into the lane, lacked a rally. WARTIME HERO four wide in the first turn, bit rank, got out a bit
midway up the backstretch, got out again to be at least six wide into the lane, back. MAU MAU void of speed, remained back in remaining well back.
ROGALLO finished before a half, far back, eased stretch.

Footnotes
GALACTIC EMPIRE outrun in the early going, asked along into the far turn, advanced four wide to a challenging position late in that bend, put a head in
front past the furlong marker, edged clear late under firm hnandling. LA FLECHA forwardly placed closer into the far turn, challenged along the rail midway
on that bend, raced on equal terms with the winner through upper stretch, continued stubbornly to the end. PURE ROCKET four wide through the first turn
while in mid pack, advanced and challenged between horses in the second turn, proved no match for the top two in the drive to finish up best of the rest.
GLASSATO broke on top, set a narrow pace in the two path, weakened when headed for the drive. EXIT broke back, lacked speed, improved position a bit
while not a serious threat. RUNQUIETLY off slow, trailed for over a half, picked off some tiring rivals while also never a serious factor. POPSTER in the
second flight early, gave way in the second turn. INDIA TIGER was never close while racing outside. COMBAT MEDAL pressed the issue for five furlongs
along the inside, stopped, distanced.

Footnotes
U. S. STEEL never far back off the inside advanced on the dueling leaders into the turn, challenged three wide midway on the bend, dueled past the furlong
marker, brushed with the runner up then edged away from that one late under steady handling. COLD AS HELL away in good order, dueled into the turn in
the two path, engaged the leader and dueled with that one upper stretch, brushed midstretch, could not match that same rival late, clearly second best. THE
ROCK SAYS settled off the pace in mid pack, traffic, steered out for room four wide into the turn, brief bid soon after, flattened. CAPTAIN DON in the
second group early, three wide and in traffic by late in the turn, went evenly through the stretch. REEF'S DESTINY void of early foot inside, closer along the
rail late in the turn, steered out to be three wide when in some tight quarters turning for home, improved inside of rivals, flattened out the final furlong.
BROTHER AARON off a step slow, failed to menace while four wide out of the turn. TOOBADSOSAD broke back and failed to menace. SAG HARBOR off
the pace well out in the strip, four out to five wide to lose considerable ground out of the turn, failed to rally. TORIN dueled up front closest to the inside,
gave way in the turn.

turning for home, drew out through the lane while being kept to task. HIDDEN PROMISE pressed the winner from off the inside, lodged a brief bid midway
on the final turn then could not keep up, stayed clear late for the second spot. EXEMPLAR off a step slow, raced back early, five wide into the lane when
lodging a mild rally to close the gap on the runner up late. TEZ void of speed, two path through the second turn, staged a mild rally to improve position.

through upper stretch, proved stubborn to the end. SIR ALFRED JAMES pressed the runner up off the inside, dueled turn, extended drive while between the
top two, not enough late. KNEEDEEPINSNOW off a step slow, raced back, staged a mild rally to improve position. ROYAL DAAHER raced in mid pack

Footnotes
LONE ROCK settled off the pace just off the inside, crept closer in the two path in some traffic late in the final turn, slipped through, dropped inside for the
drive, bid, took over, dug in late to hold off the next two. THOMAS SHELBY came in just after the start, prompted the leader off the inside, advance, took
over in the second turn, showed the way into the lane, drifted out a bit in upper stretch giving the winner a seam, responded when headed by that same foe
with less than a furlong remaining, dueled to the wire, outkicked in the final strides. BEAU LUMINARIE lacked speed along the inside, angled out three wide
when advancing into the lane, rallied to be closest to the top two a sixteenth out, flattened out late. WARRIOR'S CHARGE in the second flight while racing
three wide, came up empty for the stretch run. TENFOLD last away, bothered slightly just after, lacked speed, fanned five wide into the lane, lacked a
closing kick. TITLE READY unhurried while racing in the two path, moved closer while four wide turning for home, flat in the run to the wire. HUGE BIGLY
broke on top, set the pace inside, gave way when headed by the runner up exiting the final turn.

Footnotes
CALL ME JAMAL broke on top, showed the way past the wire the first time, clear before a half, responded when confronted by the runner up for the drive,
long stretch duel, headed a sixteenth out, battled back to narrowly prevail in game fashion. QUICK TO BLAME closest to the winner off the inside, went after
that one turning for home from the outside, extended stretch duel, put a head in front with a sixteenth remaining, outfinished. ETHEREAL ROAD lacked
early foot while just off the inside, continued in the two path when beginning to advance in the second turn, proved no match for the top two the final furlong,
well clear of the others. COASTAL CHAOS raced forwardly and along the inside, came up empty when called on for the drive. GROUP EIGHTEEN settled
off the pace and the inside, asked firmly midway on the final turn, went evenly through the lane. CHILENO lacked speed, three out to four wide through the
final turn, improved slightly without making a significant impact down the lane. MAXIMUM IMPACT last away, five wide into the first turn, continued outside
and was four wide through the second bend, came in to bump FULLY CONNECTED past the furlong marker, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing
kick. FULLY CONNECTED settled in the second flight, was tiring when bumped nearing midstretch, continued to falter. SEVEN FLAT raced in mid pack
early, had nothing for the drive. JIM AND JIM was never involved. MOUNTAIN PINE broke back, was never a threat. BON BUENO was finished after half.
