Footnotes
SIR AGGRAVATOR dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, entered the turn in the three path, forged ahead and angled in to save ground
passing the three eighths pole, kicked clear under a drive in upper stretch and drew off while being hand ridden through the final sixteenth of a mile. SIXTY
ONE chased the frontrunning set from off the pace, navigated the turn from the three path, began an outside bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, could
not go with the winner in the lane and dueled for second, just holding the place to the wire. BRONX bumped with the horse to his outside and was forced to
steady leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and gained ground on the
outside in late stretch, but was no threat to the winner. ASK FOR BODE dueled for the lead on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the
two path around the turn, continued to battle down the stretch and was outkicked late while finishing evenly. WESTERLY WIND trailed the field on the
outside up the backstretch and around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and passed tiring horses on the outside down the lane. FRANKIE Z
bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path and was
empty from there. ABHAR dueled for the lead between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle in tight quarters while racing three wide around the
turn, gave way entering the stretch and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
ASKEW was allowed to settle early, swung four wide leaving the far turn, rallied steadily to overhaul the leaders from outside leaving the furlong grounds,
and drove clear late. DREAMING OF AUDREY tracked the leaders for six furlongs, came three wide with a bid between horses through midstretch, and
went clear late for the place. JAZZY T vied early outside SWEET ACTRESS, cleared off and moved inside up the backstretch, dug in when challenged after
six furlongs, and stayed on stubbornly to deep stretch before giving way. SWEET ACTRESS contested the pace inside JAZZY T for a quarter-mile, stayed
on the chase up the backstretch, rebid from outside the pacesetter with a quarter-mile remaining, reached near-even terms through midstretch between
horses, but was outfinished. CHA CHA MISSION was outrun early, swung five wide at the top of the stretch, and made no headway. MAGNA COLORS was
no factor inside. MY TOMMY LEE saved ground in range to the stretch, and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
HALO OF FIRE was in tight at the start, advanced inside around the turn, bid inside of the pacesetter nearing the eighth pole, took over leaving that marker
and kicked clear under mostly hand urging. BALI BABY settled off the duel in the clear, bid three wide nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked by the winner
but stayed on to gain the place. PERFECT PROVISION dueled inside of BITTY BOSS, drifted out in upper stretch, led to midstretch and held third. BITTY
BOSS dueled two wide to upper stretch and weakened. I SAID HEY went evenly while racing three wide. IT'S NORA NOW hit the starting gate, raced well
back two wide, swung out entering the lane and lacked a rally while drifting about through the stretch. KEENE ON JENNY played no factor while racing
three wide. GRACIAS was off a bit slow, saved ground and played no factor. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH FRACTIONS AND RUN-UP
UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
PETER D was unhurried in the second flight for nearly six furlongs, swung five wide rallying into the stretch, reached the front from outside into the final
furlong and drove clear. STEEL CITY DUDE broke out into PANORAMA TRUCK, went up to engage PHARAOH'S PROPHECY from outside up the
backstretch, edged away briefly turning for home in the two-path, battled through the stretch inside rivals and held for the place. BORN A GAMBLER raced
mostly four wide on the turns, bid between horses past the eighth-pole and was outfinished. PANORAMA TRUCK got bumped by STEEL CITY DUDE at the
start, was under a firm hold early, waited through the far turn while boxed in behind the leaders, remained in heavy traffic through midstretch and could
never be fully set down. VENEZUELAN TRIUMPH was bumped by PROCURADOR at the start, shied out from PETER D while hard to handle approaching
the first turn, steadied behind BORN A GAMBLER a few strides later growing increasingly rank under a hold, had to be taken widest, went around the far
turn in the five-path, and could not gain. EYE OF THE TEMPLE pressed the pace between horses approaching the far turn, lodged a three-wide bid after six
furlongs, and gave way in the stretch. PROCURADOR broke out into VENEZUELAN TRIUMPH, had to be pulled off and was last away, and never reached
contention. PHARAOH'S PROPHECY got clear through a slow opening fraction, got joined by STEEL CITY DUDE up the backstretch, and was finished
after six furlongs.

Footnotes
COOL QUEST dueled two wide, drew clear in upper stretch, drifted out under left-handed urging and held firm. TWICE TOO MANY settled off the early
inside, angled three wide early on the turn, bid outside of the winner nearing the lane, was rebuffed in upper stretch but stayed on willingly to narrow the gap
late. FRONT LOADED was off slow, raced off the pace two and three wide and was along for the show. PICKING UP PENNIES dueled inside of the winner
and tired in the drive. FEAST had early speed outside and steadily faded. CASALSA played no factor while racing two wide.

RICHY dueled for the lead between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and in upper stretch, shook clear with a
furlong to go and held his margin to the wire while drifting out mildly late. DETERMINED FURY dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, got
shuffled back inside several rivals entering the turn, came on again two wide in upper stretch and chased the winner home evenly. AERONAUT stalked the
leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid four wide while racing around the turn, chased the eventual winner in upper stretch and was
outkicked late. LOYAL LOUIE settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and passed tiring horses on the
outside in the stretch. WHERE'S JOEY dueled for the lead between horses in the early going, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and
weakened on the rail in the final sixteenth of a mile. THE GREAT OZ trailed the field on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two
path around the turn, improved position between horses in upper stretch and continued to gain ground mildly to the wire. ZIP LINE TO HEAVEN dueled for
the lead between horses in the early going, saved ground the turn and faded on the rail entering the stretch. COMMITTEEMAN dueled for the lead between
horses up the backstretch, continued to battel while racing three wide around the turn and tired from there. C. P. A. GENIUS chased the leaders off the pace
through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the three path around the turn, and came up empty in the stretch.

HOMBRE raced in the second flight for six furlongs, swung five wide rallying into the stretch, and was up outside SIGRUN FAST BOY in the closing strides.
SIGRUN FAST BOY moved in around the first turn patiently handled, saved ground advancing toward the end of the far turn, shifted out with aim outside
CALL CURT in upper stretch, reached even terms for the lead between horses with 50 yards remaining, and just missed. CALL CURT dueled inside
ISLAND COMMISH from the start, got the best of that dispute shaking clear into the stretch, but could not withstand the top two late. ROCKSTAR RO
bumped with HURRICANE HILL at the start, steadied under a firm hold going to the first turn, moved inside through the run up the backstretch, came back
out three wide with a clear shot at the leaders turning for home, and did not have enough. HEZA KITTEN advanced four wide after six furlongs, but could
not sustain the rally. PRIVATE ISLAND turned in an even effort three wide. HURRICANE HILL was bumped between horses at the start, and failed to
menace toward the inside. UNCLE FUN bumped with ISLAND COMMISH at the start and was off slowest, could not reach contention, and had the rider
drop the crop in the stretch. KLICKITAT raced two to three wide on the far turn, and made no impact. ISLAND COMMISH bumped with UNCLE FUN at the
start, dueled outside CALL CURT for six furlongs, had nothing left after that, and was vanned off after the finish. J P HELLISH bumped with HURRICANE
HILL at the start, raced close up to the far turn, and retreated. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
CRYPTIC CREED pressed the pace two wide, took the lead around the far turn, drew clear then drifted out in upper stretch, straightened out under
right-handed urging and widened. CLASSIC FILM raced off the pace three wide around the first turn, advanced five wide around the far turn and stayed on
through the lane to be clearly second best. MEKANO raced in range two wide, tipped three wide nearing the lane was one-paced in the drive. SUMMER
SHANDEE saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and improved position. POETIC CODE checked repeatedly through the opening quarter,
advanced inside around the far turn but lacked a closing bid. UNIFIED CONQUEST failed to menace while racing two wide. SIDNEY'S BID tracked the pace
four wide, between foes nearing quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired. MORNING BISOU was bumped at the start and never
threatened while racing three and four wide. ECCENTRICO was bumped at the start, steadied while getting out midway around the first turn, raced five wide
from there, made a bid around the far turn and retreated through the stretch. ELBRILLO raced off the pace four wide around both turns, steadied near the
quarter pole and had no bids. SPRING THE BEAST set the pace along the rail and retreated nearing the lane.
