Footnotes
BENEFACTOR vied outside KITTEN STREET early, got the best of that dispute on the far turn, got headed from outside by FARLEY after six furlongs,
battled back gamely through the stretch and was edging away late. FARLEY stalked the dueling leaders in the clear up the backstretch, rallied to a short
lead outside BENEFACTOR on the far turn, stayed on his left lead through the drive and was outfinished. POCO CHARLIE was outrun for six furlongs,
shifted out widest in the stretch and rallied to get up for the show. INCLUSIVE bumped with KEEPSAKEKITTEN at the start, settled in midpack early three
wide, came four wide rallying off the far turn, then flattened out late. UHTRED put in a run two then three wide around the far turn, but could not sustain the
rally inside the top foursome late. PHILO was no factor three to four wide. DRILLOMATIC trailed for six furlongs, and passed only tired horses.
KEEPSAKEKITTEN bumped with INCLUSIVE at the start, and never threatened. JEHA was four wide around the first turn, and tired before reaching the
stretch. NATIONAL HONOR was always outrun. CATCHING FISH tired through a ground-saving trip. KITTEN STREET bobbled at the start, vied early
inside BENEFACTOR, and had nothing left approaching the stretch.

JOE DI BAGGIO stalked the pace three wide, seized command near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. VINNIE VAN GO set the pace along the rail, dueled
inside around the turn, put away the pace rival nearing the eighth pole, led to the sixteenth marker but was no match for the winner late. MY MANE MAN
broke a bit awkwardly, raced off the pace four and five wide and rallied for the show. BAILEY chased the pace inside and was one-paced through the lane.
SEPTEMBERTEN raced off the pace three wide, swung six wide turning for home and rallied belatedly. ENSIGN PARKER had early speed inside of
VINNIE VAN GO, steadied near the nine-sixteenths marker, switched out two wide, re-bid into the turn, took the lead near the seven-sixteenths pole, dueled
two wide around the turn then tired in the lane. BAYOU BENNY failed to menace while racing four wide. LAUDA SPEED was outrun while racing two wide.

BLUE STEEL angled over to race in the two and three path around the first turn, dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, took over a slight
lead while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held off a late closer to the wire. ZANESVILLE hit the gate leaving it,
recovered to race in the three path around the first turn, chased the frontrunners between horses up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two
path and gained ground steadily on the outside down the lane. BRASSTOWN raced into traffic headed into the first turn, angled out to the four path to find
racing room, settled in to stalk the leaders on the outside for the run up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path around the far turn, could
not go with the winner entering the stretch and finished evenly from there. ONE EYED JACK raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled on the inside
up the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the far turn and ran on well enough in the stretch to narrowly miss third. TRAPPEZOID raced
into traffic when BLUE STEEL came in headed into the first turn, raced a bit rankly behind horses in the two path from there, came up the backstretch
between horses in the middle of the pack, navigated the far turn still in the two path and was outkicked in the stretch while drifting out mildly. CAUSALISTIC
raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the frontrunners between horses up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and
faded entering the stretch. SOUPER FLY OVER saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop
back while saving ground around the far turn and continued to tire from there. COUNTY COURT angled over to save ground around the first turn, trailed the
field up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the second bend and made no bid. UNCLE CURLY raced five wide into the first turn, angled in to the
three path entering the backstretch, continued off the pace on the outside through the next quarter of a mile, began to improve position while racing in the
three path around the second turn and flattened out in the stretch. AN OBJECTION WAS FILED BY THE RIDER OF THE FIVE HORSE, TRAPPEZOID,
CLAIMING INTERFERENCE ON THE WINNER HEADED INTO THE FIRST TURN. UPON REVIEW BY THE STEWARDS, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO

PAYNTDEMBLUESAWAY vied outside CAT'S ASTRAY from the outset, gained the upper hand through midstretch and widened under a drive. DROP A
HINT bumped lightly with FOLLOW ME MOM at the start, advanced around the turn two wide, tipped to the three-path with a clear shot into the lane, and
rallied mildly to prevail for second in a multi-horse photo. BEANTOWN BABY raced three to four wide around the turn in the second flight, and rallied mildly
outside just missing the place. CAT'S ASTRAY dueled inside the winner from the start, could not match strides past the eighth-pole and weakened.
ODRAMARK was a step slow at the start and outrun for three furlongs inside, moved to the two-path and gained late without threatening. AWSUM ROAR
was last away, swung four wide leaving the turn, and improved position without threatening. RICHIES GREAT GIRL saved ground in midpack to the stretch,
and lacked the needed response. RUNNING MEMORIES raced two wide on the turn, and could not gain. STRONG ODOR was outrun inside. FOLLOW ME
MOM bumped lightly with DROP A HINT at the start and was slow underway, and never got close. ANONYMOUSLY was edgy in the gate, raced four wide
and tired after three furlongs. MUDSLIDE WICKED showed early speed three wide, and tired.

FACE OF VICTORY vied inside of KALU down the backstretch, settled back midway around the turn, angled two wide nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
regained command approaching the eighth pole, drew clear under left-handed urging, drifted out a bit near the sixteenth marker then straightened out and
held clear. KALU dueled outside of the winner down the backstretch, drew clear midway around the turn, led to the eighth pole, could not keep pace with the
winner from there and lasted for the place. AEQUOR raced off the pace four wide and rallied for the show. HERO TIGER broke a bit awkwardly, saved
ground well off the pace, tipped two wide in upper stretch and finished well between foes. ELLAS MY LOVE chased the pace three wide and lacked a rally.
HANDSOME PRINCE saved ground and failed to menace. GUACO hit the starting gate, raced well back three wide, came five wide into the lane and never

Footnotes
SWEET WILLEMINA was in range in a close-knit group early, shifted four wide and brushed with PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL being roused at the top of the
stretch, stayed on task through a long drive and was up late between horses. OUR FANTASY was allowed to settle early, took over with a sweeping
five-wide move approaching the quarter-pole, went clear through upper stretch, stayed on his left lead and could not hang on. LET'S BE HONEST was
never far back, took closer order leaving the turn while angling six or seven wide, had a clear shot from outside through the final furlong and kept on with
good courage to be clear of the rest. DON'T GET KHOZY was slow into stride and outrun early inside, angled six wide coming off the turn, and rallied on the
far outside to pick up the last major share. PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL brushed with SWEET WILLEMINA while outside that one near the three-sixteenths, and
ran on through the lane one-paced. TREVESS vied early inside rivals, edged clear briefly after a half-mile, and stayed on to upper stretch before giving way.
TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR contested the early pace two wide, and was through before reaching the stretch. LAVI was slow to get going, fanned six wide off the
turn and made no headway. WILLOUGHBY GAP forced the early pace three wide, and tired after six furlongs. PRETTY RACHEL stayed in range three to
four wide to the quarter-pole, and tired.

Footnotes
BAD BEAT BRIAN saved ground off the pace, took an awkward stride near the three-eighths pole, raced two wide around the turn while still a bit edgy,
swung out in upper stretch, surged down the center of the track and rolled by in deep stretch. XY SPEED dueled inside to upper stretch, edged clear in
midstretch and led until the final strides. THE CONNECTOR saved ground in range, rallied along the rail in the lane but was outkicked. HARRY'S
ONTHELOOSE chased the pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch and a had a mild rally between foes. DISCREET TUNE was in range two wide,
continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked the needed rally. TROPICAT saved ground off the pace, steadied near the quarter pole, angled out in upper
stretch and never threatened. BELGRANO raced off the pace three wide, swung seven wide nearing the lane and lacked the needed rally. MYSTERY
MESSENGER failed to menace while racing two wide and swinging eight wide in upper stretch. ADMIRAL ABE dueled two wide to midstretch and tired.
HENRY'S WORLD was outrun while racing three wide. FOREST SURVIVOR played no factor while racing four wide.

Footnotes
MILES AHEAD tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began a sweeping bid approaching the three
eighths pole, swung wide into the stretch and wore down his rivals down the lane to pull clear. LEGAL DEAL broke sharply and lead the field up the
backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn, could not go with the eventual winner in the stretch and chased that rival home, the best of the
rest. PUDDING raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, offered a mild bid nearing the quarter
pole and gained ground in late stretch. FINANCIAL SYSTEM was urged up the rail in the early going, settled in to chase the leaders on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked in the stretch. I'M A G SIX raced at the back of the pack on the inside up the backstretch,
began to improve position while racing in the three path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and gained ground mildly from there. LOOKIN AT
ROSES raced between horses in the early going, continued up what remained of the backstretch off the pace on the outside, came around the turn in the
two path and flattened out in the stretch. STAR SIGN hopped up leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began
a bid from the three path approaching the three eighths pole, and weakened in late stretch. BLESSED JOURNEY raced off the pace between horses
through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and was empty from there. MOTATAABEQ stumbled slightly leaving the gate, trailed
the field on the outside up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the turn and made no bid. FORTUNATE FRIENDS raced
off the pace on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
TWELVE VOLT MAN settled in midpack early, advanced three wide to loom a threat outside HANALEI'S HOUDINI coming to the quarter-pole, opted to
move inside that rival turning for home, rallied determinedly on the rail and was up in the closing strides. HANALEI'S HOUDINI tracked from close range
early three wide, wrested command outside MO HAWK just after completing six furlongs, shifted out a path seemingly in charge once straightened away for
the drive, but could not contain the top one while clearly second best. MO HAWK took over outside LUDINGTON shortly before going a quarter-mile, moved
inward getting clear up the backstretch, lost the advantage to HANALEI'S HOUDINI midway on the far turn, could not keep pace with the leaders into the
lane but ran on to salvage the show. GLORY OF FLORIDA lagged well back through the opening half-mile, gained ground five wide after six furlongs, but
could not sustain the rally leaving the far turn. HARD LIGHTING took the worst of a bump with GIROLAMO'S ATTACK at the break and spotted the field a
couple lengths, trailed inside for six furlongs, and improved position through the lane on the fence. TUNE IN raced close up early between horses, then
faded after six furlongs. GIROLAMO'S ATTACK bumped with HARD LIGHTING at the start, was close up inside on the first turn, lost some position into the
backstretch, and lacked any further response. STRIKE APPEAL was well back and four wide coming off the first turn, and never entered contention.
LUDINGTON led entering the first turn, relinquished command to MO HAWK before going a quarter, stayed on the chase to the far turn, then retreated.
BRACCIO DI FERRO was strung out four wide on the turns, and gave way into the lane.

Footnotes
MID DAY IMAGE set the pace along the rail, repulsed a bid from CLEAR VISION nearing the lane and held clear under a drive. CLEAR VISION prompted
the winner two wide, bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, was turned back by the winner but stayed on willingly to hold clear of the rest. ATTENTIVE settled
off the pace while racing two wide, angled out in upper stretch and rallied for the show. LIGHT FURY was pulling early, chased the pace three wide and was
one-paced through the stretch. MAX K. O. raced four wide in midpack around the first turn, advanced outside down the backstretch, bid three wide midway
around the far turn and weakened in the lane. MANDATE bumped BENELUX nearing the first turn, steadied along three wide between foes around that
bend, continued three deep and lacked a bid. KITTEN'S SPA was outrun inside. BENELUX was bumped entering the first turn, raced four wide and made
little impact. GO MIKE played no factor while racing four and five wide. SURF AND TURF was outrun while racing two wide. THE LAST ZIP steadied
entering the first turn, saved ground and played no factor. LOUDER THAN BOMBS broke a bit awkwardly, was in range inside and came up empty in the
lane.
