for the early lead two wide, set the tempo down the backstretch into the far turn then weakened in the stretch. TV TIZ GORGEOUS went evenly. RUNAWAY

Footnotes
PRIVATE DRIVE broke in front, set all the pace and maintained his advantage under brisk handling. VISUAL MISSION reluctant to load, settled within
striking distance inside, shifted out at the top of the stretch and had a mild late rally in the six path to finish second best. GONE TOO SOON trailed into the
far turn, swung wide and closed a gap late. OAKS HONEY failed to menace. PAT'S KARMA pressed the pace into the stretch then faded.
BLACKTIEANDTUX was bumped soon after the start then no threat. SERVE REVENGE COLD chased the winner into the stretch then gave way.
INSPIRED TO ROCK was outrun. HANSENATION was in tight between rivals soon after the start, checked and bumped repeatedly with a rival, skipped out
over heels into the clubhouse turn then was no factor. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

OUT ATTHE SPEEDWAY never far back, closed willingly outside rivals through the turn and into the stretch, made the lead near the furlong marker under
left handed urging and proved best under strong handling. UNWRITTEN stalked the early pace, loomed boldly three wide into the stretch then couldn't
handle the winner. QUEENS GIFT unhurried early, swung wide and closed a gap late in the middle of the racetrack. BLUSHING BETTY close up, angled
out to the six path entering the stretch then finished evenly. MARCIE'S CANDY passed tiring rivals two wide. WHOVILLE pressed the early pace and gave
way. WAR CAT broke in front, set a pressured pace into the stretch then weakened. LIMONATA well placed inside, lacked the needed response. MISS
TREATED STAR pressed the pace two wide into the turn, drew on even terms for the lead nearing the quarter pole then faltered.

NAMBITI broke well, set all the pace and widened through deep stretch finishing full of run to win as much the best under a strong hand ride. CAT HEAT
never far back, offered a mild bid along the inside into the stretch but was no match for the winner. MONSTER HUNTER trailed for five furlongs then had a
mild late rally in the four path while no threat. MR CHIPS pressed the early pace two wide, chased the leader through the far turn then gave way. MA MOOS
WARRIOR pressed the pace three then two wide into the far turn then flattened out in the stretch. SPLIT MY BRITCHES was no threat. SWEET JILL'S
JACK checked repeatedly behind rivals while lacking room through the first turn and was through early.
