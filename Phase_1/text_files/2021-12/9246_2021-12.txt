Footnotes
OYE COMO VA pressed the pace while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive, reached the fore in the closing yards and was going away
late. AWESOME GALAXY broke sharply to duel for the lead with CURRENTLYMYPROBLEM from the inside, edged away from that rival late but could not
resist the winner. CURRENTLYMYPROBLEM was away in good order to dispute the pace with AWESOME GALAXY while racing three-wide, vied with that
foe and gave way through the final furlong. BRASTIKA settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. WAR
MAIDEN was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and was not a factor. UH OH LUCY was off slow,
showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and did not menace.

MR NAVIGATOR dueled for the lead from the inside with SORRISO, disposed of that rival before going a half, opened a clear lead and drew off through the
lane with complete authority. MOJAVE chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain on the winner in the drive. DIIACHI settled off
the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. FAIR CHALLENGE lagged early, saved ground through the turn and
finished evenly in the drive. SORRISO was away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half.
SMOOTH PAPA raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened.

TWITTERATI raced unhurried early, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and quickly drew off. BOOGIE TWO SHOES was
away in good order to duel for the lead with THRILL'S LEGACY while racing three-wide, edged away from that rival in the final furlong but could not match
strides with the winner late. THRILL'S LEGACY disputed the pace with BOOGIE TWO SHOES from the inside and gave way through the final furlong.
FAITH IN EXCESS settled off the leaders from between foes, steadied nearing the quarter, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths marker and finished with
some late run. TWILIGHT GALAXY showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and failed to threaten. MAYBEE A DIVA lacked early foot, raced
three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MISS GLORIOUS showed brief speed, raced three-wide through the turn and weakened. MADIGAN
SQUEEZE broke sharply to vie for the lead while racing four-wide and weakened after the opening quarter.

Footnotes
TOIL AND TROUBLE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a quarter to run and was ridden out to
the wire. MANCUSO AT THE MIC settled off the leaders from the inside, was no match for the winner in the drive but held on well to save the place.
NORTH FORK was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with good late energy. BACK
ALLEY CAT lagged early, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out further into the lane and finished evenly late. OXBOW PARK lacked early foot, raced
off the rail through the turn, reached a contending position but lacked the needed closing response. CAPTAIN DASHI disputed the pace from between foes,
moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. EXPRESS PERMISSION pressed the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. SIR
DEPUTY dueled for the lead from the inside, tried to lug out through the turn and weakened.

MY COWBOY sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off through the lane. MORE HONOR settled off the leaders from the
inside, angled out into the stretch, could not reach the winner but finished with a steady bid. PLAYOFF BOUND was never far back, angled out with a
furlong to run and failed to gain in the drive. THEMANBEHINDTHEMAN lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with some late run.
PASSED BY PAUL chased the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter and lacked the needed rally. JOHNNY raced off the pacesetters
early, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten. MO BOB (IRE) was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and
weakened. SOMETHING SUPER showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not menace. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
CURIOUS INJI sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch, drifted in nearing the sixteenth pole,
responded when challenged by BRIGHTSIDEOFLIFE with a sixteenth to run and held gamely to prevail. BRIGHTSIDEOFLIFE was off a step slow, raced
just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, rallied late and just missed in a head-bob. JEWEL AZUL was reserved just off the
leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive, steadied nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly when clear. OUR LITTLE TIGER chased the
winner while racing three-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive. BUY WAVE BUY lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and failed to
rally. COPPER CHARM showed brief speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and weakened. DADDY'S GIRL drifted out through the first turn and
lagged far back throughout. THE RIDER OF JEWEL AZUL LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST CURIOUS INJI CONCERNING THE STEADYING OF HIS
MOUNT AT THE SIXTEENTH POLE AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS FOUND CURIOUS INJI AT FAULT FOR DRIFTING IN
FRONT OF JEWEL AZUL AND DISQUALIFIED JEWEL FROM FIRST AND PLACED HER THIRD FOR THE INCIDENT. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
