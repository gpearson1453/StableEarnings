Footnotes
DAIRY KID vied for lead three wide on the backstretch, continued to battle for lead heading to the turn and came in to bother foes approaching the turn,
shook clear midway through the turn and held safely in the stretch. MY BELLA CHICK vied inside on the backstretch, entering the turn bumped by outside
rival, continued along the inside on the turn and into the stretch, proved no match to clear winner in the stretch, and held second safely. SWEETENER
stalked leaders in between rivals on the backstretch, went to rail entering the turn, continued along the inside into the stretch, and under light urging missed
second. BALLET ROYALTY saved ground throughout, launched mild bid under under steady urging to best rest. GODDESS APHRODITE antsy, stalked
leaders three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn and failed to launch a rally when asked. PROJECT LOGIC sent to contest lead in
between rivals on the backstretch, continued to battle for position heading into the turn when DAIRY KID came in and bothered both PROJECT LOGIC and
MY BELLA CHICK, with PROJECT LOGIC getting the worst of it and checking completely out of the race. STEWARDS INQUIRY, AFTER REVIED DAIRY
KID WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR CROSSING OVER WITHOUT SUFFICIENT CLEARENCE AND PLACED BEHIND PROJECT LOGIC
