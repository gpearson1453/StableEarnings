MY GLORY close up from the start, slipped through along the rail entering the stretch, gained a narrow lead and proved best under strong handling while
fully extended. GRAY ROYALITY never far back, shifted out on the turn, loomed boldly four wide and just missed. ANDIAMA pressed the pace two and
three wide until deep stretch then was outfinished. AWESOME WONDER away alertly, set a pressured pace near the inside into the stretch then weakened
late. BLUE SAGE reared at the start and was no factor. TIPARILLO bore out at the start and was outrun. YAMBOREE QUEEN vied for the early three three
wide then flattened out. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
EDGE O'S ME sprinted too the lead while drifting out to the six path soon after the start, angled back inside nearing the turn set all the pace and maintained
her advantage under a strong hand ride. AVA'S DESTINY never far back, rallied along the rail through the turn, checked past the five sixteenths and the
quarter poles shifted out to the two path in upper stretch and finished clear for second. LITTLE WHO never far back, had a mild rally late in the four path.
TILLY MANILLY chased the pace two wide into the stretch then weakened. BRICK OF HEARTS failed to menace. ANIMO STAR was no factor. JAILBIRD
WEDDING was no threat. HEART OF RUBY stalked the pace three wide into the turn then stopped. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND
THE RIDER OF AVA'S DESTINY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN, AFTER
REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED EDGED O'S ME AND PLACED HER SECOND.

Footnotes
COWCHI broke sharply, dropped back, came on again near the inside through upper stretch, drifted out to the five path, made the lead late and just lasted
under left handed urging. EARLY BLOOMER unhurried, swung wide, closed fast six wide and just missed getting up ion time. SWEETASAHONEYBEE
settled inside, angled out on the turn and finished with good courage four wide. GOLOSA allowed to settle, was steadily gaining ground late along the rail.
KLEONA sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, widened on the turn, maintained her advantage until deep stretch then weakened readily. REYS
PINA COLADA chased the pace into the stretch then faded three wide. LUCKY PENNY ROSE was no factor. NOT JIMMY'S TOY was outrun.
TITEBLUEJEANS chased the pace into the turn then stopped.
