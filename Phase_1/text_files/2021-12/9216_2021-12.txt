Footnotes
HIDENSEEK SALLY quick to the front, well handled throughout and stayed clear in the final furlong. BRIGHT VENEZUELAN chased pace to no avail while
best of the rest to the wire. SEDUCTIVE (IRE) stumbled badly at the start and lost best chance, ran along for show spot outside. THAT'STHEWAYTODOIT
tracked three wide to turn but weakened in the stretch run. L. A. STAR had no speed to the stretch and closed the gap late while never a real threat. GO
STELLAIRE raced evenly while lacking the late response needed. MAUK'S TUFF never factored. SKYVALUE broke just a bit tardy at the start with an
outside trip while no menace. ALYDARIUS tried to keep up but faded back quickly.

MS TEMPTATION broke slow, trailed to turn, angled four-five into stretch and rushed to wire to prevail. THIRTEEN STRIPES raced outside throughout, ran
on for place late. BIA BOLT RUNNER tracked inside to turn but lacked a late response and settled for show. FIFTH RISK no speed to the stretch, finished
well to close the gap too late. ON BRILLIANT quick from gate outside but outsprinted to the lead and raced evenly thereafter. LUCKY US speed to the front,
set pace to the stretch, faltered late going. DO YOU LOVE ME had good position while never far back but failed to respond when needed. FASTEST SPIN
had a slow start, went extremely wide out of the turn and closed late gap while never a threat. SUPER CAT LADY never menaced. SWEET SPIN never a
factor. CLAIRE'S DELIGHT speed to press pace, gave way past quarter pole and stopped.

speed to the turn, rallied outside with a late gain for place while no match. TOP GUN GIRL speed from two path, dueled into stretch, clear, held show spot.
ERASE outside run to turn, bid into stretch, could not stay on late. A DANGEROUS GUY perfect position throughout with no late bid when needed.
PRIVATE ROAD raced evenly throughout with no late bid. SPEIGHTY WAR reared in the gate and never menaced. READY TO MARCH unruly in the gate
pre start, went up inside speed to turn, dueled and gave way readily in the stretch. CALL ME GUSTO never menaced. ZOOMBIE tried to keep up to turn but
gave way readily from the quarter pole. THE PENINSULA off tardy, never factored thereafter.

Footnotes
HIDDEN IDENTITY chased pace close up, angled out with a wicked late rush to get up in the final stride. LUCKY LIZZIE speed inside, stayed game under
confident handling to the stretch, stayed game to the wire but lost the headbob in a good effort in defeat. HER GIANT no speed to the turn, came on for the
show spot while no real threat to the top pair. UNWANTED INPUT tardy from gate, slow into stride and only improved position late. MAGIC LEMONS raced
wide out of turn and stretch run with no late gain. TOP HAT INVASION inside run to turn, gave way in deep stretch. PLATINUM GALE outside run to turn,
could not keep up in the stretch on rail and leveled off. MAJESTIC ICE no speed to the turn, floated out widest into stretch with no gain.
HOLDONTOYOURTIARA pressed pace two path early on, gave way from the turn. GINGERMYSISTER inside position to the turn with nothing left in the
stretch run.
