Footnotes
DIABLO CAT went to the front, drove clear, saved ground around the turn, dueled down the lane and prevailed for the win. GRAND PRADO pressed the
pace, challenged throughout, dueled down the home stretch and was outfinished for the win. FIFTY PROTECTION unhurried in the beginning, moved up on
the outside around the turn, made a wide bid and was outfinished by the top two. PERFECT PERIGEE raced within striking distance, saved ground around
the turn and lacked a finish. KINLEE'S SONG lacked early speed, came around the turn wide, angled in down the stretch and was never a factor. BRAD
EYE raced within contention and faded. EBONY FLASH void of early speed, saved ground around the turn and was never close.

forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but held on for place. TOE BANDIT lacked early speed, moved up on the outside around the
second turn, made a wide bid and was outfinished for second. PURIM KING void of early speed, showed late interest, finished wide and was no factor.
FAST VERDICT raced within striking distance and weakened. THAT'S D 'CAT sprinted to the front, drove clear, moved inside and faded. WISE GUY
challenged on the front end and was finished early. REAL BRAVE lacked early speed, moved up on the rail around the final turn, was blocked, lacking
running room and proved no threat.

Footnotes
SPEEDY FELLAR dueled for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, drove clear down the home stretch and was kept to the task. PINCH
ASSAULT unhurried in the beginning, came around the first turn on the outside, made a late bid, racing four wide, proved no match for the winner, but got
up for second. BOW AND ARROW raced near the back in the early part, made a late gain, racing wide and just missed the place position. ST. LOUIE GUY
raced within contention, finished evenly and lacked a late rally. STEPHEN'S ANSWER dueled on the front end, took the lead down the backside, weakened
and lacked a finish. SOCIAL AFLEET lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. LOVETHATCAUSE void of early speed, came around the
second turn on the outside, finished wide and was no threat. HE TAKES CHARGE raced near the middle of the field, saved ground around the final turn and
faded, while finishing wide. DECEMBER SEVEN pressed the early pace and dropped back. BUXTERHOOTER always raced near the back and showed
little.
