Footnotes
MONARCH MAN lunged in and hindered a trio of inner rivals at the start, stalked the leading pair from the outside and just off, ranged up into the far turn,
bid turning for home, assumed command in upper stretch, and held well from a pursuing AFTERNOON ANEJO to the wire. AFTERNOON ANEJO tracked
from the three path, tipped to the four path in upper stretch to take aim outside of a clearing MONARCH MAN, and chased that foe home to prove second
best. WILLIAM'S CAUSE took a bump from an outer foe into an inner rival at the start, settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted three wide in upper
stretch to claim show from an outer TIZABIGMICK at the furlong grounds, and held that position. TIZABIGMICK tracked in the two path around the first turn,
shifted to the four path into the backstretch, produced a show bid in midstretch, but was denied by an inner foe. GRAN MUCHACO was sandwiched
between horses at the start, trailed along the inside, met traffic approaching the final furlong while shifting off of the rail, then failed to factor. ASSET
TALENT vied two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, but proved no match for his outer counterpart at the quarter pole, and faded.
SHADYFIED bumped an outer foe at the start, set the pace along the inside, vied inside of a pair of rivals around the far turn, then weakened passing the
quarter pole. MUCHO VELOCE was pinched back between horses at the start, sat reserved along the inside, took the far turn in the three path, and was
done entering the lane.

Footnotes
PLUM GOOD hopped at the start and was last away, rushed between horses to be forwardly placed, stalked from behind the leading pair while in the two
path around the bend, tipped three wide passing the quarter pole, ranged up in midstretch, but shied from rider correction when lugging inwardly at the
furlong pole, straightened to bid at the sixteenth pole, and edged an advantage late. STEPH'S SPIRIT sparred outside of LIL ADEAU for the lead, led at the
five sixteenths pole, inched clear in upper stretch as an outer PLUM GOOD menaced, and got bested by that foe in the final sixteenth. LIL ADEAU dueled
for the lead inside of STEPH'S SPIRIT, got headed at the five sixteenths pole, fought on through upper stretch, but yielded at the furlong grounds. SPEAK
TO ME broke a step slowly, chased three wide, the faded after being floated four wide in upper stretch. AMERICAN REBEL saved ground off of the pace,
but to no avail. MAW MAW'S SOPHIA tracked from the two path, shifted three to five wide turning for home, but lacked a rally. LUCKY GONE SWEET
broke a step slowly at the start, got caught three to four wide while off of the pace, and faded. GILDED APPLE got outrun.

Footnotes
HOLIDAY HOUSE settled far off of the pace four wide, gained while shifting six wide in midstretch, rallied outside of foes to bid a sixteenth out, and edged
clear. RUMBLE READY tracked from midpack four wide and outside of foes, ranged up five wide through upper stretch, bid between horses at the sixteenth
pole, brushed with an inner foe at that marker, but was outkicked by an outer rival shortly after, and held place. LUNAR ROCKET laid off of the pace two
wide, chased while shifting to the three path through upper stretch, split through a large opening in the final furlong, produced a bid in the final sixteenth, but
failed to reach a pair of outer foes late. PRAYFORPEACE stalked three wide, chased four wide and between horses through upper stretch, but brushed an
outer foe while tiring at the sixteenth pole. DOT'S DOLLAR stalked two wide and between horses, split foes three wide in upper stretch, chased before
bidding approaching the final sixteenth, but flattened out. STREET N SOUR set the pace inside of a vying foe, shook clear passing the quarter pole, but
tired entering the final furlong and was overhauled passing the sixteenth pole. SNOW CANDY never got involved. SHOOT THEMESSENGER was off slowly
and got outrun. MUD ISLAND broke a step slowly, raced far off of the pace three to two wide into the turn, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and failed to
factor. EXCELLENCY laid close up along the inside early on, stalked into the turn, chased turning for home, then faded in upper stretch. SIMPLY VALID

HOOPERDRIVESTHBOAT set a clear pace, dug in at the furlong grounds as ON YOUR MARK bid, and gamely repelled that foe in the final sixteenth. ON
YOUR MARK tracked two to three wide, ranged up four wide entering the lane, shifted down two wide to engage a leading HOOPERDRIVESTHBOAT at
the furlong grounds, but was repelled late. GULFSTREAM WAY was wrangled back off of the pace early on to stalk along the inside, lacked a kick to split
foes two wide in upper stretch, altered three wide after being outkicked at the furlong grounds, then chased the leading pair home while holding show. IN
SKY WE TRUST tracked from midpack along the inside, tipped to the three path around the turn, then five wide in upper stretch, but leveled off and chased
evenly. PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE stumbled at the start, then failed to factor. SCHMOOZIN never got involved. GUNNER PAUL got outrun. POPULIST
stalked two wide, but weakened between horses three wide in upper stretch.

Footnotes
WHENTHEDAWNBREAKS rated off of the pace in the two path, got outmoved by an inner RED HOT MAMA turning for home, sustained chasing stride
while shifting to the four path through midstretch, then surged outside of the leaders in the final sixteenth. RED HOT MAMA tracked from midpack along the
inside, tipped three wide turning for home to commence a rally, gained through midstretch while aiming between the leading pair, bid at the sixteenth pole,
but was outkicked by an outer rival soon after. DELIGHTFUL MOMENT stalked two to three wide, took aim on the clear leader entering the lane but only
managed to chase that foe through midstretch, got outkicked by rivals on either side in the final sixteenth, then just reached show. COLORS OF THE WIND
got restless in the gates waiting for the start, gained a clear advantage into the first turn, maintained that clear margin well into the final furlong, but was
overhauled by a trio of foes in the final sixteenth. SPOOKY ROAD stalked two wide, then chased through the lane. PARIS KENTUCKY laid at the rear three
wide into the first turn, checked and shifted four wide into the backstretch behind a troubled rival, tracked four wide around the far turn before shifting six
wide entering the lane, then moved up mildly. SPIRITCATCHER got caught in the four path while off of the pace around the first turn, gained five wide and
outside of the leading group around the far turn, but flattened out entering the lane without menacing, and tired thereafter. KNOW BY HEART (IRE) sat
reserved along the inside, shifted to the four path turning for home, then to the six path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. LADY MAEVE (IRE) tracked
four wide, steadied between horses passing the three quarter pole, quickly faltered between horses entering the backstretch, then failed to recover. GREAT
ADVENTURE got fractious in the starting gate, rushed to stalk along the inside, then faded through the lane. FEVER DREAMING tracked from midpack five
to four wide around the turns, and tired. JUSABOXACHOCOLATES rated at the rear two wide and between horses, but steadied behind a troubled rival into
the backstretch, and never got involved. WOW ME FAST laid at the rear four wide, and got outrun. MARIA GONE WILD was taken up from between horses
after prompting the pace between horses to track three wide, but got rank three among foes and lost position between horses while under restraint around
first turn, ended up three wide and off of the pace before getting shuffled back behind a faltering LADY MAEVE (IRE) entering the backstretch, and was
done early.

Footnotes
GIRL WITH A DREAM took a bump from an inner foe at the start, set the pace inside of a pressing foe, met COM' ON SWEET LUV's bid at the five
sixteenths pole, resisted and inched a clear margin entering the lane, then gamely maintained that advantage as that rival persistently pursued. COM' ON
SWEET LUV came away last of all, recovered to track three wide, ranged up outside of GIRL WITH A DREAM at the five sixteenths pole, but was denied
reaching that foe's throatlatch entering the lane, chased that foe from just behind her hip thereafter, but was second best. MYSTIQUE SABOTEUR rated far
off of the pace, shifted four wide entering the lane, and moved up to reach show on the wire. IMPLOSION stalked along the inside, but only managed to
chase the leading pair through the lane, then got nailed on the wire for show. RUNNIN HAPPY got fractious in the starting gates, pressed the pace two
wide, but was outkicked by an outer foe turning for home, then weakened through the lane. RED HOT MOON broke outwardly, then never got involved.
JULESFORYOU showed little.

Footnotes
EXCESS MAGIC pressed outside of the leader from the three path around the first turn, inched closer to vie into the far turn, drew away from that foe in
upper stretch, and held safely from a chasing POINT ME BY through the final furlong. POINT ME BY stalked in the four path around the first turn, intently
pursued the leading pair from the outside around the far turn, then chased EXPRESS MAGIC through the lane to prove second best. RIGHTANDJUST set
the pace in the two path around the first turn, showed the way from an outer vying foe around the far turn, but gave way to that rival in upper stretch, then
held show. HIDDEN ENEMY (IRE) saved ground off of the pace, tipped two wide into the far turn, then failed to threaten while chasing evenly. BIG LAKE
stalked along the inside, fought restraint passing the wire for the first time, remained keen in the bit while under a tight hold around the first turn, settled into
stride into the far turn, but chased through midstretch and faded late without factoring. ARABIAN PRINCE laid off of the pace two to three wide, and failed to
factor. AWESOME GERRY tracked from the five path around the first turn, but was done early. THE SIX FURLONG FRACTION WAS OMITTED AND IS
PENDING REVIEW.

AUDREY'S TIME trailed in the four path around the first turn, stalked the leading pair three from the outside around the far turn, bid entering the lane, forged
an advantage in upper stretch, and edged away late. POWDER RIVER stalked inside of the clear leader while in the two path around the first turn, bid inside
of that foe at the half mile pole, vied around the far turn, briedly led at the quarter pole, but got headed by an outer bidding foe in upper stretch, yielded, but
held place. VELVET CRUSH saved ground off of the pace, chased under urging around the far turn, tipped outside of POWDER RIVER in midstretch in
hopes of producing a place bid, but needed more. CHEETARA (CHI) set a clear pace in the three path around the first turn, vied outside of POWDER
RIVER around the far turn after that foe bid at the half mile pole, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. JUDY'S WAY laid off of the pace in the
three path around the first turn, and was done early.

LOVELY RIDE stalked two wide, bid for the lead inside of the wandering leading approaching midstretch, led passing the sixteenth pole as AMICHE
menaced, and held. AMICHE stalked the clear leader from the three to four path around the first turn, then three wide around the far turn before being
floated back four wide entering the lane, sustained pressing position under a long drive through midstretch, but was outkicked by an inner LOVELY RIDE in
the final furlong, kept on, and held place from an inner foe late. PRINCESS THEOREM saved ground at the rear, rallied with a quick turn of foot two wide
and between horses through the final furlong, but missed reaching an outer foe for place. TOUCH OF CLASS set a clear pace while intently off of the rail,
shifted three wide entering the lane, wandered about while maintaining an advantage through midstretch, but was headed by rivals on either side at the
sixteenth pole, and weakened. BARISTA stalked along the inside, chased along the rail through midstretch, but flattened out late. OUT OF SORTS saved
ground off of the pace, chased in the three path around the far turn, then kept on late. ARM CANDY tracked four to three wide around the first turn, then four
to five wide entering the lane, but lacked a bid. ASSERTIVE STYLE hopped slightly at the start, rated far off of the pace five to four wide around the first
turn, rallied outside of foes five wide around the far turn, got floated six wide entering the lane, but flattened out in midstretch. AMALFI PRINCESS laid at the
rear two wide, and got outrun. BECCA'S ROCKET lacked speed four to three wide, and never got involved. SUKI laid off of the pace three to two wide, and
faded. THE SIX FURLONG FRACTION WAS OMITTED AND IS PENDING REVIEW

Footnotes
CHATTALOT dueled for the lead along the inside, shook clear of a pair of vying rivals in upper stretch, and lasted. UNDERHILL'S TAB pressed the pace
three wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole, but was repelled at the three sixteenths marker, came again late as the clear leader tired, but was only second
best. BLUE KENTUCKY tracked four to five wide, then chased through the lane to gain show. FREELANCER stalked along the inside, altered to the four
path in upper stretch, but lacked a kick. KAELY'S BROTHER saved ground off of the pace, came into the lane tow wide, but was floated out into tight
quarters in upper stretch, then shifted six wide in midstretch, and failed to factor. HIGHER STANDARD took a bump from an inner foe at the start, dueled for
the lead three to two wide, then from between horses turning for home, but weakened at the three sixteenths pole. HOIST THE GOLD bobbled into an outer
foe at the start, and never got involved. MAGICIAN STONE got outrun. THE RIDER OF KAELY'S BROTHER CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF
FREELANCER FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH, BUT IT WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.
