KITTYBE QUICK settled off of the early pace, improved position while three wide on the second turn, was asked for run at the furlong marker and made a
late push to get by HAYDEN'S ANGEL in the final strides. HAYDEN'S ANGEL settled off of the early pace, gained ground on the second turn while two
wide, closed in the stretch but was outkicked in the final stages by the winner while clear of the rest. BALL LASS set all of the pace into the second turn, led
into the stretch but weakened in the late going. BRITTANY BREEZE stalked the pace into the second turn and tired in the stretch run. STYLIZED stalked
the pace through the backstretch, steadied in tight quarters on the second turn, stopped nearing the head of the lane, was eased and walked off under her

O'NEILL'S LEGACY was away alertly and set the pace while being pressured, extended the lead off of the turn, felt pressure in the late stages but held to
prevail in a drive. RUN FOR MY HONEY stalked the pace from a three wide position on the turn, closed willingly in the stretch and pressured the winner in
the late going but could not reel her in while holding for the place. HAPPY AT SHADY settled toward the rear on the turn while saving ground, rallied along
the rail in the stretch and won the nod for third, while mildly challenging for second. MARANDO PASS stalked the pace while saving ground on the turn, lost
ground leaving the turn and was outfinished in the late stages. SHE'S NOT TO BLAME pressed the pace through the turn while traveling two wide and
weakened in the stretch drive. DEELITEFUL LIZZY was away slowly, was outrun into the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
REGAL LADY stalked the early pace while two wide on the turn, tipped out for the stretch run, had firm right-handed encouragement applied through the
lane and had a late kick to prevail. SOMARA tracked the pace through the turn while two wide, put away the tiring pacesetter into the final furlong to take the
lead but was tagged in the final strides by the oncoming winner, while clear of the rest. COASTAL STARLITE was shuffled back a bit at the start and lost
many lengths into the run into the turn, was kept to task through the turn and made a bold late bid to gain ground through the stretch and could not reel in
the top two but was clear for the show. BABE'S GOT APPEAL was away alertly and set the fractions from the inside, led into the stretch but tired and was
caught inside of the furlong marker. CHARGING HOME chased the pace from a three wide path on the turn and weakened in the late going.

TROJAN CLUBHOUSE was away in good order and set the pace while rating nicely, continued to be in a comfortable rhythm while in hand along the
second turn, extended the lead into the lane and pulled away in the late going, gearing down in the final strides. STEIN'S GIRL hopped at the start with the
rider nearly losing balance in the process, recovered to sit off of the pace while three wide into the second turn, closed well in the stretch and while no match
for the winner was a clear runner-up. RUNNING LUCK steadied in tight quarters along the first turn, stalked the pace from a ground saving position into the
second turn, lost ground to TROJAN CLUBHOUSE off of the turn and was outkicked in the stretch run, while a clear third. INDIAN JAZZ was rank along the
first turn, then prompted the pace through the second turn while three wide, lost ground leaving the turn and faltered in the late going. HASTA LUEGO
stalked the pace through the second turn while saving ground and faded in the stretch run. SHE'S EXPENSIVE stalked the pace into the second turn while
three wide and gave way in the stretch run. CONSENTIA saved ground while unhurried in the early going, stayed along the inside through the second turn
and was not a factor. EVENING AMBITION tracked the pace through the second turn, lost ground along the second turn, stopped, was eased and walked
off under her own power.

Footnotes
SMOKINHOTREDHEAD settled off of the pace while saving ground, was three wide between foes in tight quarters nearing the quarter-marker, swung to six
wide for the drive, was urged in the lane and surged in the final sixteenth to prevail. COCOA CENTS was away well and set contested fractions through the
second turn, shook off the two pressing rivals for the stretch run, had a clear lead into the late stages but was caught inside of the sixteenth-marker while
besting the rest. FIRE DIAMONDS saved ground while unhurried in the early going, was two wide on the second turn, swung to seven wide for the stretch
run and closed well in the stretch to claim the show. FANTASTIC SECRET stalked the disputed pace from a ground saving position, gained ground leaving
the second turn but was outfinished in the stretch drive. LIZZY'S INTHEGAME settled off of the pace, mounted a five wide bid leaving the second turn to
gain ground but finished evenly in the late stages. AMERICAN ROYALTY was forwardly placed into the second turn, mounted a four wide bid into the
stretch to improve position but flattened in the stretch run. ALWAYS IN VEGAS pressed the pace through the second turn and weakened in the stretch run.
PULPIT SINGER pressed the pace while two wide between rivals and faded in the drive.

vied for the lead inside of the final sixteenth and was tagged in the final strides by SUGAR BEETS while winning the nod for the place. RICH WARRIOR

from WILD WAGER and then was passed with a rush by the winner in the final strides. DREAMED IT settled in the second flight while saving ground and
lacked a late response in the stretch run. PHILIPIE FAST set a quick pace into the second turn, was confronted by RICH WARRIOR leaving the turn and

Footnotes
MUGARITZ was sent leaving the break to set the fractions, rated nicely through the backstretch, was confronted by RIVER ROSE nearing the furlong
marker, dueled with that determined foe and dug in in the final strides to prevail in a game effort. RIVER ROSE stalked MUGARITZ through the second turn,
closed the gap on that rival inside of the final furlong, dueled determinedly but could not get by the game winner and settled for second best. ROBBER
BARON was forwardly placed while stalking the pace in the early going, was three wide on the second turn and was outfinished in the stretch run, while
holding for third. OF GOOD REPORT settled toward the rear of the field, was two wide on the second turn and finished evenly in the late going. DUB TOWN
saved ground through the early stages while stalking the pace, lost ground on the second turn, was climbing nearing the quarter-marker and lacked a late
response in the stretch. OUR EXPECTATION was unhurried in the early going, saved ground on the second turn, hit the rail leaving the second turn and
lacked a late response.

Footnotes
BOISE sat just off of the early pace, was three wide in tight quarters along the second turn, continued to be in tight in upper stretch while waiting for racing
room, tipped out nearing the sixteenth marker and had a strong late push to prevail. DEGREE OF RISK tracked the early pace while saving ground,
mounted a three wide bid on the second turn to take the lead into the lane, was under firm right-handed urging in the final sixteenth, was caught in the final
strides and outfinished, while clear for second. DR PESCADO was unhurried in the early stages, was four wide on the second turn, rallied well in the stretch
and got up to claim the show. C'MON MAN sat just off of the early pace, mounted a four wide bid on the second turn, closed well in the stretch and just
missed for third. IL CAPITANO was away alertly and set the quick pace through the second turn, was confronted by DEGREE OF RISK approaching the
furlong marker and weakened in the late going. SAINT IVES tracked the pace through the backstretch, gained ground while two wide on the second turn,
continued that run into the stretch but was outkicked in the late going. BANDERA AZTECA stalked the pace through the backstretch while saving ground,
improved position along the second turn and gave way in the stretch run. DIMMI QUANDO settled toward the rear of the field, was two wide on the second
turn and lacked a late kick in the stretch. MIDNIGHT MOJO stumbled at the start and settled in the early stages, saved ground through the second turn and
did not offer a late rally.
