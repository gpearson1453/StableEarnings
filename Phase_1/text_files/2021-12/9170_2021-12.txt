Footnotes
DEVINE DENTAL controlled the pace inside, widened into the stretch and lasted while shortening stride late. SACRAMENTO Q settled inside then made a
gradual gain through the stretch just missing. MUCHO MACHO EDDIE pursued the loose leader outside, was asked for run on the final turn and finished
willingly. TACTICAL PLAN trailed early inside, angled out in the stretch and rallied. IN EQUALITY dropped back in the two path and lacked a response.
CHAMPERS raced in closest pursuit of the winner and proved empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
SCOOP DAWG vied two wide for the lead, shook free on the backside, responded when roused and moved up under urging in the final furlong.
VERRAZANO BRIDGE vied inside for the lead, chased the winner on the far turn, dug in gamely in the stretch run and came up second best.
PREFONTAINE reluctant to load, raced three wide early, moved up inside on the far turn and bested the others for the show spot. FRED'S GONEFISHING
stalked the leaders, chased on the far turn and failed to rally. GO SKIPPY GO raced off the pace between rivals and failed to threaten. FACTUM LOVE
STYLE raced off the rail, off the pace, went two wide on the far turn and did not factor. RICKIE'S MELODY lunged at the break and broke poorly, went three
wide on the first turn and did not factor. BESTER raced off the pace inside and gave way.

Footnotes
REFI settled outside the dueling leaders, bid into the stretch and edged clear through the final furlong. HARPER earned a narrow lead inside but could not
hold off the winner while continuing gamely. MOON PISTOL dueled outside to midstretch then weakened. COBBLE HILL lacked speed, moved inside on the
turn then showed some late energy. GLACIER EXPRESS raced wide throughout and flattened out in the stretch. WEEKEND IN COURT dropped back
behind inside and was never a factor. FAST NEGOTIATIONS saved ground within striking range then faded on the turn. GOLDENLINEOF chased inside
and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ALRASHAKA broke slowest, rushed to contention, bid to front near quarter pole, drew away and coasted home the final sixteenth. CRAZY SERENA trailed
briefly inside then rallied along the rail to gain the place. BE WATER prompted the pace outside then weakened in the stretch. ALICE HARPER earned a
narrow advantage inside then faded after half a mile. MY THOUGHTS dropped back outside, raced wide throughout with a mild bid. HALLIGIRL chased in
the two path and gradually faded. SOMMER VELVET lacked speed outside and was never a factor. ADVOCATE HARBOR saved ground, made a brief bid
on the turn and gave way. KISSIN COUSIN stopped abruptly on the turn, lost contact with her field and was eased through the stretch. PER RULING
