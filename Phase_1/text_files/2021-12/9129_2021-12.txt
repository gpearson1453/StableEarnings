Footnotes
MOUNT SINAI stalked the pace two wide, seized command nearing the lane and drew off under a drive. BRODY'S CAUSEWAY saved ground in midpack,
angled three wide turning for home and ran on to gain the place. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH was off slowly, raced off the pace two wide, angled out in upper
stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and was along for the show. PRETTYASPINK was no threat while racing three wide. SPLICER failed to
menace while racing three wide. LOVIN MAKES CENTS set the pace along the rail, was collared approaching the head of the lane, continued on the left
lead in the stretch and tired. MISS BLUEBIRD was up close inside while bit rank and retreated through the lane. BRINGTHEWINE played no factor while
racing two and three wide. CHASE THAT DREAM was outrun inside.

Footnotes
ALA TURKA advanced outside the leaders after three furlongs, wrested command from CANDYMEISTER in midstretch and drew off under pressure.
CANDYMEISTER vied early inside KINGSTON QUEEN, let that one go toward the end of the run up the backstretch, went around and rebid outside
KINGSTON QUEEN on the turn, held a short lead once straightened away for the drive, proved no match for the winner a furlong out while staying on her
left lead, and lasted for the place. MILL LAKE LADY was outsprinted to the stretch three wide, found her best stride belatedly and was getting to the
runner-up from outside at the finish. KINGSTON QUEEN contested the early pace outside CANDYMEISTER, cleared off and moved inside heading to the
turn, and gave way readily in upper stretch. RENEESDREAMGIRL raced two wide around the turn, and could not gain under pressure. LOOK UP TO
HEAVEN was a step slow at the break, and retired early inside.

Footnotes
MY PRANKSTER chased the leader on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, went to a drive while racing in the three path approaching the
three eighths pole, was carried wide coming off the turn, gained ground on the outside in a game duel down the stretch and wore down his rival in the final
strides. LITTLE VIC veered in and bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, recovered and was urged to the lead up the rail up the backstretch,
continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, and dueled gamely down the lane, drifting out slightly and
giving way grudgingly late, the best of the rest. HEY PORTER bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the inside up the
backstretch, began to move up while racing in the three path around the turn, and continued to gain ground mildly in the stretch while proving to be no
match for the top two. FROSTED ARMOUR trailed the field on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and was never a threat.
LUCAGO chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn, and continued to tire in the stretch.

Footnotes
NO NAY MAYBE (IRE) bobbled slightly at the start, pursued PERSONAL MEADOW from outside early, got floated out a couple paths challenging for
command turning for home, forged clear leaving the furlong grounds, and lasted late for the decision. OFFICER COUNTRY broke in bumping BIG CITY
RED, lagged well back outside for three furlongs, came four wide beginning to find stride off the turn, rallied steadily outside and came up just short.
PERSONAL MEADOW set the pace removed from the rail, drifted to the three-path unable to stave off NO NAY MAYBE into the stretch, and gave way a
furlong out. SPEND BENJAMINS saved ground outsprinted early, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, and rallied mildly for the last major share.
BIG CITY RED got bumped by OFFICER COUNTRY at the start, and was no factor two wide. BEINFUN raced three wide, had the rider drop the crop a
quarter-mile out, and tired. VENERATE chased inside for three-eighths of a mile, and tired.

Footnotes
CASCADE PARK raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid
from the three path passing the three eighths pole, gained ground on the outside in upper stretch and pulled clear in the final furlong. BARBARA raced in the
three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge the frontrunner from the two path while racing
around the far turn, dueled in upper stretch, could not go with the winner in the final furlong and chased that rival home, just holding second. HARD TO
IGNORE led the field under a hold while racing in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn,
dueled from the rail in upper stretch, was passed by the winner in late stretch and finished well, just missing second. WILDCARD KITTEN saved ground
around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, and gained some ground in late
stretch. PRETTYKEEN hit the gate leaving it, trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, moved up slightly while saving
ground around the far turn and came up empty in the stretch. STRAIGHT TO GO raced off the pace in the three path through the opening half mile,
improved position while racing in the two path around the far turn and flattened out in the stretch. WINNING LAUGH ducked in leaving the gate, recovered
to save ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and made no bid.

DRAIN THE CLOCK dueled inside of GATSBY to deep stretch and inched ahead under left-handed urging. GATSBY dueled outside of the winner to deep
stretch in a game try. WHERE PARADISE LAY chased the top two while racing two wide, angled three wide nearing the lane, lacked the needed rally but
stayed on to hold third. NOCTURNAL was pushed inward at the break, angled out soon after and made progress under a hustling ride, raced three to four
wide around the turn and lacked a closing bid. SAGAMORE MISCHIEF broke inwardly and trailed while racing a bit off the rail.

Footnotes
KATAMA MOONLIGHT pressed JABUTICABA from outside, ranged up to take over on the far turn as TAKE CHARGE RO loomed up to her outside, put
some daylight on the latter through upper stretch and remained clear under a steady drive. JEZEBEL'S KITTEN went along unhurried and in range for six
furlongs, came three wide into the stretch, and wore down TAKE CHARGE RO for second. TAKE CHARGE RO advanced three wide threatening KATAMA
MOONLIGHT after six furlongs, was turned away through upper stretch, and gave up the place late. ONYX was well back for a half-mile, took closer order
approaching the stretch while fanning out four wide, and finished up evenly. LOVELY LUVY was under a snug hold early inside, crept closer into the far turn
shifting to the two-path, checked sharply out of tight quarters leaving the quarter-pole and dropped back. STARSHIP NTERPRISE showed little inside.
JABUTICABA set the early pace inside, got headed by the winner on the far turn, and folded up soon after. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
NO NANNETTE NO raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began a bid between
horses approaching the three eighths pole, entered the stretch in the two path, kicked clear with a furlong to go and held off a late closer to the wire.
AMAZIN QUEEN raced in the three path around the first turn, angled in to run at the back of the back on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn
from the three and four path, began a bid nearing the quarter pole and gained ground steadily on the outside to the wire. CAGUA bumped with the horse to
his outside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, began a bold move from the three path
while racing around the turn, dueled in upper stretch, gave way with a furlong to go and was the best of the rest. CHARLOTTES WAY was reluctant to load,
chased the leader from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the two path and improved position mildly in
the stretch. STARE IF YOU MUST raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn
between horses in the two path and gained ground mildly down the lane. MY D'VALENTINE raced four wide into the first turn, settled off the pace on the
outside for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path and was outkicked on the outside in the stretch. LA CUMPARSITA
raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path nearing the three
eighths pole, folded entering the stretch and faded further from there. YO YO MON bumped with the horses to his inside leaving the gate, recovered to race
at the back of the pack in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path and had no kick in the stretch.
CUPID AUSTIN saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, raced in the three path around the far turn and
made no bid. ENOUGH RAIN bumped with the horses to either side leaving the gate, was shuffled back while racing in the two path around the first turn,
trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and offered no bid. WITHOUT A VIEW saved ground around the first turn, continued up
the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, navigated the far turn from the two path and was empty from there. THE CUBAN MISSILE was sent
to the lead early while racing in the two path around the first turn, led the field up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the
second turn and continued to tire in the stretch.
