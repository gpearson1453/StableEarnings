RINSE AND REPEAT chased three wide around the turn, four wide into the stretch, steered widest in the drive, reached the front approaching the sixteenth
pole and drove clear. MINOSO brushed the gate and came away a bit slow to begin, stalked off the rail then two wide into the turn, exited the bend four
wide, bid between foes at the eighth pole, got outkicked by the winner in deep stretch but earned the place. RESTLESS RAMBLER dueled outside
JUSTAMITCH for the lead, battled around the turn and four wide into the lane, took over with a furlong remaining but was soon passed and got edged for
the place honors. SURPRISE FASHION off slow to begin, chased four wide into the turn, five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. JUSTAMITCH
dueled from inside into and around the turn, held a short lead in the drive then lost command at the furlong pole and weakened. POLITICAL LOOPHOLE
broke out, traveled along the inside then two wide into the lane and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DR. TROUTMAN brushed leaving the gate, had early speed three wide into the first turn then moved to the two path, set the pace inside a pair of rivals up
the backstretch, cleared with seven-sixteenths remaining, opened up around the far turn, led clear into the final furlong and held off the late rally from the
runner-up. CAMINO DE ESTRELLA broke in and brushed rival at the start, took the first turn three wide, angled in and saved ground through the far turn,
rallied along the fence, reached the winner in the final sixteenth but did not have enough to get by. T BONES TRICK broke out and brushed TROMADOR,
had speed along the inside then ceded the lead around the first turn, moved off the rail stalking the pace, angled five wide into the stretch, stayed within
striking distance through the drive but lacked the needed late punch while finished a clear third. TROMADOR bumped between rivals at the start, chased
two wide early, moved out and went four wide into the far turn, exited the bend six wide and made no impact. INDY JONES brushed by outside rival at the
start, went five wide into the first turn then angled to the four path, attended the pace three deep up the backstretch, chased outside a rival on the second
bend then four wide into the lane and faded. THE BLACK ALBUM (FR) went four then three wide on the first turn, pressed the pace from between rivals, lost
touch at the seven-sixteenths pole, chased three wide into the lane and tired.

PREMIUMONSATURDAY vied for the lead three deep then dueled leaving the backstretch, lost a bit a ground to the leader and chased three wide leaving
the turn, came back on from outside, dueled with SELF ISOLATION in the final furlong and edged the runner-up in a game effort. SELF ISOLATION stalked
the top trio from outside, loomed four wide into the stretch, took over with three-sixteenths remaining, dueled with the winner in the furlong grounds and got
outkicked for the victory. ALL DIALED IN chased well off the rail then three wide into the turn, exited the bend four to five wide, kept on through the lane
while moving inside and gained the show. BELLEO'S MUSIC broke in, vied between rivals then was crowded a bit and took hold from the nine-sixteenths to
the seven-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into the lane and lacked a rally. LITTLE SUSIE came in at the start, went up to vie for the lead from inside then
dueled leaving the backstretch, took full control around the turn, led two wide into the stretch, lost command with three-sixteenths remaining and weakened.
KITTEN'S KID chased outside a rival while wide up the backstretch, navigated the turn four wide and weakened.

Footnotes
ON DECK chased widest up the backstretch, went four wide into the turn, moved out and took aim six wide entering the stretch, rallied outside the top pair
with a furlong to go and edged MUCHA WOMAN at the wire. MUCHA WOMAN dueled for the lead from inside, vied along the rail then two wide into the
stretch, fought on to the final furlong, battled with a pair of runners to the outside in the final sixteenth and just missed. A NEW PEACE dueled for the lead
from outside, held a short lead through the turn, led four wide entering the stretch, maintained the advantage into the final furlong and yielded grudgingly
between foes late. DID I STUTTER broke a step slow, tracked two wide into the turn, angled in leaving the bend, bid along the inside but faltered in the late
stages. BRITTLE AND YOO stalked the pace on the inside, saved ground around the bend, kept inside making steady gain but needed more in deep
stretch. FULL OF GRACE tracked between foes to the turn, went three wide around the bend, came four wide into the drive, was within striking distance
entering the final furlong but could not summon the needed late kick. SWIRLING stumbled leaving the gate, chased off the rail, bid three deep into the turn,
came five wide into the stretch and weakened.

went two wide into the stretch, steered out in upper stretch and closed well to gain the place. SHE'S SO SHINY broke well and took the early lead, dueled
briefly then chased the leader into the turn, went two to three wide into the drive and kept on through the furlong grounds for the show. WORK TO LIVE

Footnotes
STAR ENTRY forwardly placed in the beginning, went two wide into the turn, remained off the rail into the stretch, drifted out while rallying through the lane
and bested DADSTAR in the final sixteenth. DADSTAR broke out and bumped rival, sped clear to take control early, showed the way two wide into the
stretch, drifted out through the lane, resisted the challenge from STAR ENTRY late but succumbed to the pressure in the end. MAD STEVEN chased the
pace outside a rival, exited the turn three wide, angled widest and closed willingly outside the top pair. ORTH got pinballed leaving the gate, put in tight
quarters and checked early, went three wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch and could not rally. MEDINA MAN got bumped both sides at the start,
chased along the inside through the turn and failed to respond when called upon. PAULAS CAUSE tracked widest of all early, went four wide into the turn,
angled down to the two path around bend and weakened in the lane. MAJESTIC WIND broke in and bumped rival then lost his path at the start, trailed two
wide into the turn, eased out around the bend and came six wide into the stretch and never got involved.
