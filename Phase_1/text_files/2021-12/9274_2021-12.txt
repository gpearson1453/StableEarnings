Footnotes
WILD WAGER was allowed to settle off of the early dueling pacesetters, mounted a three wide bid on the second turn to vie for the lead, struck the front into
the lane and pulled away in the late going. UNION BLISS was away alertly and contested the pace through the second turn, was confronted by WILD
WAGER nearing the quarter-marker, could not hold off the winner but kept on in the stretch to be a clear runner-up. PHILIPIE FAST settled off of the two
pacesetters through the backstretch run while saving ground and did not offer a final bid in the stretch run. BUBBLES IS ON FIRE was unhurried through
the backstretch run, saved ground through the second turn, drifted out under firm left-handed encouragement nearing the furlong marker and lacked a late
rally. DREAMED IT contested the early pace with UNION BLISS, continued to duel with that foe on the front end through the second turn, gave way leaving
the turn and was eased in the stretch. VENTRY settled toward the rear through the backstretch run, gave ground into the second turn and was eased in the
stretch.

Footnotes
MY FRIEND TONY was away alertly and set the fractions while being pressured by CONTINENTAL UNION, was able to gain a bit of ground on that foe into
the stretch but was challenged again in the final sixteenth and dug in to prevail. CONTINENTAL UNION dueled with MY FRIEND TONY into the turn, lost a
bit of ground to that one on the turn, re-rallied in the final furlong to close on the winner but could not reel him in while besting the rest. RED HOT CAT
stalked the pace from a two wide path on the turn, improved position in upper stretch but was outkicked in the late going. HARDY CHISEL chased the pace
into the turn, lost a bit of ground on the turn while along the inside and was outfinished in the stretch run. HAWK'S RISING chased the pace while saving
ground on the turn and was not a factor. KLAY NATION tracked the early pace, was three wide on the turn and weakened in the stretch run.

ZERO BUCKS GIVEN dueled with HANDSOME ACCOUNT through the early going, continued that duel along the turn, turned away HANDSOME
ACCOUNT inside of the final furlong and drew clear in the end. POSO CREEK bobbled at the start and chased the dueling pacesetters into the turn, was in
tight along the turn while three wide between foes, tipped out for racing room in the final furlong and got up in time to claim the place. HANDSOME
ACCOUNT was away in good order and dueled with ZERO BUCKS GIVEN through the turn, was turned away by that rival nearing the furlong marker and
was outfinished in the late stages. MINSKY (IRE) chased the contested pace from an inside position, lacked room in upper stretch and was outkicked in the
drive. COLONEL MIKE chased the pace, was two wide between foes on the turn and faded in the stretch run. SEVERIN stalked the pace into the turn and
gave way in the late going.

Footnotes
MARANDO PASS tracked the pace through the backstretch run, gained command on the second turn while two wide, turned away the bid of the runner-up
inside of the final furlong and pulled away in the end. SMILING MELANIE bumped with REMEMBER SUE at the break, settled off of the pace through the
backstretch run, gained ground while three wide on the second turn to challenge MARANDO PASS, was turned away in that effort but bested the rest in the
stretch run. CHELINA was allowed to settle through the backstretch run, gained ground while four wide on the second turn and was outfinished in the drive.
REMEMBER SUE bumped with SMILING MELANIE at the start, tracked the pace from a two wide path through the second turn and tired in the stretch run.
GINGERDOODLE was unhurried through the backstretch run, improved position while five wide on the second turn but lacked a late response in the stretch
drive. DEELITEFUL LIZZY settled just off of the early lead, lost ground on the second turn and weakened in the stretch. BALI BRAVA was away alertly and
contested the early pace, was rank along the first turn, ceded the lead on the run along the backstretch and gave way in the drive. BALL LASS contested
the pace along the first turn then gained command on the run along the backstretch, retreated quickly along the second turn when the rider's saddle slipped
and was not asked for run in the late going.

Footnotes
SWANEE attended to the early pace of MISS LADY ANN, gained ground on that rival along the turn while two wide, took the lead leaving the turn, felt
pressure in the late stages from the oncoming runner-up but held to prevail. GO SMILEY GO stalked the early pace, was under a snug hold along the
backstretch run, steadied in tight quarters along the turn while two wide, closed well in the stretch to pressure the winner but could not reel her in while
besting the rest. DRAW ME was a bit slow in the early going, improved position along the turn while four wide and continued that run in the stretch to win the
head nod for third. EYE ON TIGER had no early speed, trailed along the turn while two wide and closed willingly in the late going to just miss for third. NO
COVER CHARGE tracked the early leaders into the turn while three wide, improved position into the stretch and finished evenly in the drive. MISS LADY
ANN was away quickly and set the fast fractions through the turn, was confronted by the winner nearing the furlong marker and tired in the late going. SING
IN THE WIND chased the pace from the inside and gave way in the stretch run. MS BLUE OCEAN chased the pace from a three wide path and faded in the
stretch.

LADY'S SERMON stalked the dueling pacesetters into the turn, gained ground from a three wide position to challenge SHES BOUT A MOVER, dueled with
that foe inside of the final furlong and wore that one down to prevail. SHES BOUT A MOVER pressed the moderately quick fractions from a two wide
position, dueled with the winner inside of the furlong marker but could not hold her off and kept on to be a clear second. TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL chased the
early pace from a two wide path on the turn, gave ground leaving the turn and was outfinished in the drive. ALESHA was unhurried along the backstretch
run, was three wide on the turn and mounted a mild late gain in the stretch run. GOLD RUSH GAL had no early speed and was not a factor. MISS UNION
was away alertly and showed good speed to duel with SHES BOUT A MOVER through the turn while contesting the pace, was able to gain a bit of ground
on that foe leaving the turn but gave way in the late going.

Footnotes
POWER SURGE tracked the early pace, improved position on the turn while three wide, came to terms with AUTISM INNOCENCE nearing the furlong
marker, found a stubborn foe in that rival, was urged in the final sixteenth and held to prevail in a drive. AUTISM INNOCENCE was away alertly and set the
moderately quick pace from a two wide path, met the bid of the winner leaving the turn, battled back and stubbornly gave way in the late going while besting
the rest. DULCE EMMA tracked the pace from the inside, was outkicked in the stretch run by the top pair but held to save the show over an oncoming rival.
VINCERO GRANDE saved ground while settling off of the early pace, closed willingly leaving the turn and just missed for third. GETAWAY CHARM stalked
the pace from a two wide path on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch run. SOUND OF THE SURF was a bit slow in the early going, improved
position on the turn while two wide but flattened out in the stretch run. JOHNEEDWNTHESTREET was shuffled leaving the start and had no early speed,
was two wide on the turn and lacked a late response. PRAY TO AN ANGEL was forwardly placed while four wide on the turn and gave way in the stretch
run. AVERY ON POINTE chased the early pace, lost ground while four wide on the turn and was not a factor. SOO BROOKLYN broke out at the start,
chased the pace from the rear into the turn while five wide and did not have a late rally.

Footnotes
CANAM GAL prompted the pace through the turn, closed on ST. ANNIE'S INDY nearing the head of the stretch, took the lead leaving the turn and pulled
away, gearing down in the end. ALL MY HOPE was pinched at the start and was a bit slow in the early going, chased from the rear through the turn while
two wide, was in tight nearing the furlong marker and angled out for the drive, closed well and while not able to reel in the winner bested the rest. ST.
ANNIE'S INDY was away alertly and set the moderately quick pace through the turn, was collared by CANAM GAL nearing the head of the lane, ceded the
lead to the winner and did not have a late response. SEGURO was forwardly placed while stalking the pace from the three path on the turn and did not offer
a late bid in the stretch run. RAMONCITA LIGHT settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide on the turn and was not a factor. BLACK DROP stalked
the pace from the second flight, was two wide on the turn, and weakened in the late going. STAND IN YOUR LOVE chased the early pace from a ground
saving position, lost ground along the turn and into the stretch and gave way in the late going.

Footnotes
EXCEED SPEED LIMIT sat just off of the early pace into the turn, mounted a three wide bid nearing the head of the lane to confront SAINT GREY, took the
lead from that foe, was pressured late by the runner-up, was firmly urged using right-handed encouragement and held to prevail. SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS
saved ground while tracking the early pace, gained ground in upper stretch, closed well in the late going to pressure the winner but could not get by him
while besting the rest. NICKEL NICKEL NINE settled toward the rear in the backstretch run, improved position while five wide on the turn and continued that
rally into the stretch to earn the show. WEARENOTBADPEOPLE settled toward the rear, was four wide on the turn, gained ground leaving the turn but was
outfinished in the drive. SAINT GREY was away alertly and dueled with GREAT STORY for early pace duties, was confronted by the winner nearing the top
of the stretch and weakened in the drive. MURPHYS TIGER dwelt at the start and spotted the field several lengths, saved ground through the turn and
passed by tiring rivals in the stretch run. JUST WATCH ME NOW tracked the early pace while two wide, was shuffled back nearing the quarter-marker while
in tight quarters and faded in the stretch. GREAT STORY engaged SAINT GREY leaving the break to duel for pace duties through the turn, lost ground
nearing the head of the stretch and gave out in the late going.

Footnotes
TABLE FOR TEN settled in the second flight through the run along the backstretch, was four wide on the second turn, swung to eight wide for the drive,
closed fast in the final sixteenth to confront TOM'S SURPRISE and dug in to prevail. TOM'S SURPRISE settled off of the early pace while traveling in the
second flight, was four wide on the second turn, angled out to seven wide in upper stretch, gained ground through the lane, had the lead in the final
sixteenth but was caught and outfinished by TABLE FOR TEN in the final strides. GALLANT WARREN settled in the midflight while saving ground through
the backstretch run, was two wide on the second turn while gaining ground and continued that rally into the stretch to claim third. LONG LANCE was
forwardly placed through the second turn while stalking the pace, gained ground into the stretch but was outkicked in the late going. BURNIN TURF was
hustled to duel with PAINT ME LUCKY for pace duties through the second turn, shook free of that foe leaving the turn but was caught inside of the furlong
marker and gave way in the late stages. HOLY GHOST was allowed to settle at the rear of the field, made a two wide bid leaving the second turn to improve
position but finished evenly in the stretch run. CHIEF JACKSON tracked the pace through the backstretch run, was three then four wide on the second turn,
lost position leaving the turn and weakened in the drive. BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) was rank along the first turn while settling toward the rear the field, slipped
to the inside along the second turn to save ground and lacked a late response in the stretch run. PAINT ME LUCKY was away in good order and set
contested fast fractions through the second turn, felt pressure nearing the head of the stretch and tired in the late going.

Footnotes
SUNNY SPOT settled off of the pace in the second flight, mounted a four wide bid on the second turn, vied for the lead inside of the furlong marker and just
lasted in the final strides over an oncoming runner-up. TOUGH IT OUT was unhurried through the second turn, was angled out nearing the head of the lane
to circle the field while nine wide, closed with a rush in the final sixteenth and just missed for the win. EARNEST pressed the pace through the backstretch
run, gave a bit of ground on the second turn, was urged in the stretch run and made up that gap but was outfinished in the late stages, while holding on for
third. SINGLE BARREL was forwardly placed through the second turn, vied for the lead inside of the eighth pole and was outkicked in the final sixteenth,
just missing for third. LINFIELD settled off of the pace through the second turn, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch run and closed willingly in the final
sixteenth. ROBS LUCKY SPIRIT was unhurried through the backstretch run, mounted a four wide bid on the second turn and while not able to reel in the
leaders was gaining in the final stages. HONG KONG COWBOY was away alertly and set the all of the pace, gained a bit of ground on the field leaving the
second turn but was caught nearing the furlong marker and weakened in the drive. FOUR O'FIVE tracked the pace from the second flight through the
backstretch run, was two wide on the second turn and lacked a late kick in the stretch. INVERTIGO stalked the pace from a three wide path on the second
turn and weakened in the stretch run.
