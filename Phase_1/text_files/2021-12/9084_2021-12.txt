Footnotes
HOLDING PATTERN broke in and slowly, raced back in the run up the backstretch as a result, lodged a strong move into contention while four wide late in
the turn, took over, and drove well clear. ROLL DINERO ROLL broke alertly, dueled up front off the inside, shook clear in the two path late in the turn,
proved no match for the winner the final furlong, held sway for the place. LOU'S ARROW bothered at the start, raced in the second flight off the inside, three
wide into the stretch, slowly getting to the runner up late while also no threat to the winner. DANCIN ROCKET forwardly paced early along the inside,
remained within striking distance through the turn, came up empty in the drive. BRASKA lacked speed, angled out to be four wide turning for home,
improved slightly without posing a threat. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY back off the pace and the inside, dropped to the inside late in the turn, lacked a closing kick.
MY KINDA TETON moved to the rail midway on the turn, bothered slightly soon after, remained back. LUCKS BIG BOY pressed the runner up early toward
the inside, began a steady fade before a half.

TRUMPET LILLY broke on top, cleared to the inside into the first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch while still showing the way, drew out through the
stretch under steady handling. GUANA CAY within striking distance while racing along the inside, moved out a bit when moving closer late in the final turn,
proved no match for the winner in the drive, clearly second best. LEA RO void of speed, lodged a modest rally while saving ground throughout. RIGHT
TRAPPE chased the winner for five furlongs in the two path, gave way turning for home. ITALIAN TWIN settled off the pace and the inside, failed to
menace. FLASHY BIZ in the second flight early, steadily faded off the inside.

PEACEFUL STREET broke sharp, relinquished the advantage before a furlong, pressed the leader from the two path into the turn,. dueled through the
bend, shook clear when straightened for home, held the runner up comfortably safe in the late going under steady handling. LITTLE FRAPPUCINO off
slowly, moved out to be four wide soon after, steady advance four to five wide out of the turn, lost some ground to the leaders into the lane as a result,
rallied to be in time for the place, no real threat to the winner. DRIFTER moved up steadily inside the winner to show the way up the backstretch, dueled
with that same rival through the turn, weakened in the drive. BLUES TUNE broke in, was straightened to race in the second flight, moved slightly closer in
some traffic late in the turn, came up empty for the drive. BOURBON DELIGHT forwardly placed while three wide, had little left for the drive as well.
GLASSATO off a step slow, was never a threat in the two path. WE THANK YOU also away a step tardy, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
SLICK SILVER stalked the pace while three wide, moved to challenge on the outside in the second turn, put a head in front turning for home drew clear
under steady handling in the run to the wire. MAJOR ATTRACTION broke alertly, moved out to be in the two path first turn, prompted the issue in the run up
the backstretch, challenged inside the winner and between horses in the second turn, proved no match in the drive, clearly second best. BLUERIDGE
TRAVELER away in good order, cleared to the inside before a quarter, set the pace the middle half, responded when confronted by the top two in the final
bend while remaining closest to the inside, could not keep up in the drive, saved the show. REVENIO lacked speed while racing off the inside, improved
position slightly in the drive without posing a threat. KNIGHTS KEY in mid pack while racing along the inside, saved ground to no avail in lacking a closing
kick. FOXY ACE five wide into the first turn, remained well wide the middle half to be four wide through the second bend, failed to muster a rally when called
on . PAUL THE WAITER last away, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S BATTLE forwardly placed up the backstretch after breaking with the leaders, advanced under her own courage to challenge, drew steadily
clear through the lane to win with something left. AIN'T SHE A PISTOL pressed the issue up the backstretch off the rail, challenged inside the winner and
between horses through the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive while holding sway for the second spot. KEINO void of speed in trailing early,
steered out a bit for the drive, rallied for the show and was slowly getting to the runner up. FASHIONABLY QUICK raced behind the first flight toward the
inside, advanced slightly to be closest to the top two past the furlong marker, flattened out, caught late for the show. BABY IT'S YOU set the early pace
along the inside, vied through the turn closest to the rail and inside the top two through the turn, weakened in the drive. GRACIE WILL SMILE remained
back in failing to menace. PEPPER POINT hesitated at the break, raced in mid pack then came up empty for the drive. BURNING BUSH balked at loading,
trailed most of the way while racing four wide.

DR. FORMAN close from the start off the inside, vied through the turn while racing three wide, kicked steadily clear in the drive while under pressure.
REPLETE in the second flight while along the inside, moved a bit closer turning for home, long drive for the place spot, dug in game to prevail for that
position while not a threat to the winner. TRUE SAINT in the second flight while between foes, moved closer to chase the winner past the furlong marker,
had little for that one late, outgamed in the final strides for the place. RAVENS REFLECTION with the early pace while closest to the inside, faltered once
headed entering the stretch. ARCH ABILITY last to leave, moved up to a forward position while four wide, also weakened when the real running began
exiting the turn. EL BOHEMIO fell steadily back after a furlong, trailed home in failing to menace.

DASH ATTACK in the second flight while between foes, continued to race in the second group into and through the far turn, roused and angled out three
wide, closed with good resolve to be up in time. REWIRE with the pace while racing four wide through the first turn, continued outside, dueled through the
second turn in the three path, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to the winner late, determined for the place. GOIN
TO THE SHOW outrun in the early going, angled out to be four wide turning for home, rallied late to be along for the show. SEAL BEACH set or forced the

Footnotes
TOP GUNNER broke well from along the inside, set the pace in the two path, came three wide into the lane, clear past the furlong marker, enough left to
hold the runner up safe in the waning strides. CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK back off the pace w4ell off the inside, four wide into the turn, five wide exiting when
beginning to advance, closest to the winner past the furlong marker, late bid, denied. CAUSEWAY JONES pressed the issue three wide, fell back off the
winner turning for home, went evenly through the lane to finish best of the rest. MANHATTAN UP void of speed while toward the inside, two path through
the turn, improved position through the stretch, not enough for the show. MO'S MOJO off a step slow, raced back early as a result, swung five out to six
wide exiting the turn, improved position through upper stretch then flattened out a bit late. COWAN off a step slow to be last away, moved closer while in
some traffic late in the turn, lacked a finishing kick. W W SCOUT'S HONOR broke out, was straightened to race with the second group toward the inside,
had little for the drive. MARVIN fell bac three wide before a half, not a factor. BULL HOLLOW forwardly placed for a half, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
LADY ASTRID off the pace and the inside, raced three wide through the turn, shifted out when straightened for home, finished full of run to win going away
at the end. THE MARY ROSE in the second flight, saved some ground into the turn, came in the two path for the drive, challenged between foes past the
furlong marker, proved no match for the winner late, determined for the place. KABOOM BABY also in the second group while outside the runner up, four
wide into the lane, challenged on the outside past midstretch, flattened out a bit, outkicked for the place while well clear for the show. EURO ME off a step
slow, raced well off the pace while three wide, set down for the drive, displayed some late interest through traffic. TAPIT RIGHT in mid pack while racing
between horses through the turn, lacked a closing kick. TOO PRETTY went one paced throughout while saving ground. WILLOW MOON broke sharp,
narrowly set the pace closest to the inside, gave way in the drive. MS SASSY ATITUDE in tight, steadied early, remained always back in lacking a
response. PROUD VICTORIA off a step slow, rank and sluggish early, was never close. HEATED ARGUMENT dueled early off the inside, gave way.
MATAPAN fell back to trail after the start, never close.
