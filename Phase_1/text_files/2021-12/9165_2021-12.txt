Footnotes
MY BOSS LADY broke in the air to spot the field several lengths, continued to lag into the turn, angled out to be five wide turning for home, closed with good
resolve to be comfortably in time. VERY SPICY raced off the pace while racing outside, advanced to a challenging position four wide late in the turn, took
over past the furlong marker, led late, could not contain the winner. WICKED STREET away in good order, sprinted clear the opening furlong, continued to
show the way into and through the turn in the two path, battled through upper stretch then began to weaken a bit when headed past the furlong marker,
saved the show. UNHERDOF lacked speed off the inside, moved closer three wide inside the runner up, flattened out the final furlong to finish up evenly.
BABY CLOUD in the second flight along the inside, moved out slightly to be in the two path entering the stretch, weakened in the drive. AND ISLES chased
the early leader, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
MO CHOCTAW broke sharp, quickly sprinted, maintained a large advantage up the backstretch and through the turn, drew off through the lane under token
encouragement to win ridden out. KILGORE in the second flight while racing in the two path, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clearly second
best. BOTANY broke back, moved out to be three wide turning for home, had little for the top two in the run to the wire, finished up best of the rest.
SOBRIETY chased the winner early, began to gradually weaken just before a half. HACKER void of any early foot, dropped to the inside in the turn, went
evenly through the lane. SMOKIN BOOTS last to leave, trailed up the backstretch, three wide turn, failed to muster a rally. MOONSHINE MAX raced in mid
pack up the backstretch, faded while racing off the inside.

BRICE away in good order outside, 3w into first turn, dueled middle half off the inside, shook clear, kept to task. GAGOOTS void of speed, moved closer in
some traffic in the two path late in the final turn, could not get to the winner, proved determined to narrowly prevail for the second spot. GO FOR SHERRIE
broke alertly while coming out a bit, showed the way into the first turn along the inside, dueled, could not keep up with the winner in the drive, caught late for
the place. EXULTING off a step slow, moved out to be three wide through the first turn, remained in the three path in racing evenly throughout. HOOKED A
GOODWIN within striking distance just off the inside, had little left for the drive. HARDLY A SECRET remained back in showing little.

CAN'T BEAT ME outrun in the early going, began to advance while four wide midway on the turn, came three wide into the stretch, lodged a late bid while
widest of the first flight in deep stretch, put a head in front in the waning strides. DRIFTER in the second flight off the inside, advanced three wide late in the
turn, dueled past the furlong marker, missed while between horses at the wire. HELLEPHENT broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch along the
inside, dueled stretch while remaining inside, proved stubborn to the end. PIKACHU hesitated at the break, raced on the outside exiting the turn, improved
position slightly while not a serious threat to the top three. RAISE THE PURSES pressed the issue while outside the early leader, continued to be forwardly
placed through the turn, had little left for the drive. REMEMBER NORMANDY made little impact while racing off the inside. LOOKIN GOOD SO FAR
forwardly placed in the early going, began a steady retreat before four furlongs. LEAD OFF dwelt at the start, remained sluggish up the backstretch and
through the turn, closed the gap marginally through the stretch.

Footnotes
CHARLIECANDO stalked the leader off the inside, advanced, took over late in the final turn, drew well clear while kept to pressure. SPEIGHTSTOWN
AGAIN allowed to settle off the early pace inside, moved out, three wide when moving a bit closer in the second turn, proved no match for the winner
through the lane, narrowly lasted for the 2nd. ASSUMPTION lacked speed, four wide when with the second flight through the final turn, getting to the runner
up late while inside that one. WHEREVER HE IS broke well, cleared to the inside, showed the way up the backstretch inside, offered but brief resistance to
the winner when that one challenged late in the final turn then faltered in the drive when headed by that rival. SO BRAVE chased the issue early in the two
path, fell back the third quarter, moved out three wide turning for home then went evenly through the lane. BOLD MINISTER off a step slow, raced back,
dropped inside second turn, improved a bit into the lane then flattened out. CHASE TRACKER remained back, floated out four wide turning for home,
remained back in failing to muster a rally. INTO ORBIT stumbled badly at the break, remained always back. FIRST RATE in mid pack early, finished early
toward the inside.

Footnotes
BACK TO NORMAL broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, remained clear past the furlong marker, allowed the runner up the inside late, enough left to
hold off that one late. MAMZOOJ behind the leaders along the inside up the backstretch, continued behind traffic through the turn, continued to save ground
into the lane, late bid inside the winner, outkicked. BET HE'S READY prompted the pace outside, three wide through the turn, lacked a winning kick in the
final furlong. DEPUTY CONNECT last away, raced back while off the inside, three wide through the turn, staged a mild rally to improve position. MAASAI
WARRIOR fell back after the start in failing to show much early interest, saved ground through the turn, also improved position through the stretch with
some modest late energy. EV'S SHERMAN pressed the pace for a half, weakened in the drive. TREATY raced in mid pack while racing three wide, failed to
respond when called on for the drive. ROBERT'S GHOST was finished after a half. SKYLINE four wide late in the turn, remained always back.

Footnotes
BANDIT POINT off a step slow, raced back and in the two path, dropped to the inside turning for home to impede MAN IN THE CAN, shifted back off the
inside when straightened for home, rallied through traffic to be in time. TEMPT FATE forwardly placed while between horses early, fell back off the leader in
the turn, rebid outside that one nearing the furlong marker, dueled, led late, could not contain the winner. YOUNG BULL behind the leaders off the inside,
three wide through the turn, advanced upper stretch, not enough for the top two in the late going while remaining out in the strip. FIVE O ONE back off the
pace and the inside, raced three wide through the turn, improved position with some modest late interest. SOUIXPER CHARGER in mid pack while toward
the inside early, angled out to be four wide turning for home, went evenly through the lane. HERITAGE PARK broke alertly, dueled up front off the inside,
shook clear in the turn, continued to narrowly show the way past the furlong marker, faltered. GOODNIGHT ARCHIE dueled early along the inside, chased
the leader through the turn, weakened in the drive. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN off slowly, failed to menace while three wide through the turn. DUSTY HILL
within striking distance up the backstretch, came four wide into the lane, had little for the drive. MO BETTA fell well back after the start, five wide trip,
showed little. MAN IN THE CAN off a step slow, lacked speed inside, was cut off by BANDIT POINT dropped in late in the turn, trailed home. FOLLOWING
A CLAIMI OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF MAN IN THE CAN AGAINST BANDIT POINT FOR INTERFERENCE EXITING THE TURN, THE LATTER WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED ELEVENTH.

Footnotes
PERFECT HAPPINESS forwardly placed while racing off the inside, closer three wide late in the turn, took over nearing the furlong marker, edged clear
under firm handling. TIME LIMIT prompted the early pace along the inside shifted out for the drive, up late for the show, not a threat to the winner. SARAH
HARPER away in good order, sprinted clear to show the way up the backstretch, two path through the turn, weakened when confronted the final furlong.
NOVEL SQUALL off a step slow, moved up and turned in an even effort while in the two path. BREAK CURFEW fell back to trail soon after the start, failed
to menace. MISS IMPERIAL was not a factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
ITSALLINTHENOTES with the pace inside, headed in the run up the backstretch, regained the advantage in the second turn, shook clear when straightened
for home, enough left to hold the next two safe in the waning strides. SHIP IT in mid pack for six furlongs, tipped out to be four wide turning for home,
steadily closing the gap on the winner late while holding sway for the place. GLAMOUR GIRL last to leave, trailed well back early under firm restraint, two
path through the final turn, steered out to be widest of the front runner with less than a furlong remaining, finished willingly while too late. MEGAN'S CLARA
pressed the winner early off the inside, moved up to duel the middle half, showed the way late backstretch, weakened when turning for home. LIL KINGS
PRINCESS prompted the pace while three wide for six furlongs, had little left in the late going. DESCENTE lacked early foot, dropped inside for the run
through the second turn, moved back outside for the drive and went evenly through the stretch. SENSE YOU LEFT forwardly placed early toward the inside,
steadied briefly in traffic late in the first turn, weakened in the drive. PYRAMID PRINCESS four wide through the first turn, remained always back. FLIPPING
FAST raced in mid pack while four wide through the first turn, remained outside, four wide again in the second bend, failed to muster a rally. ABSOLUTE
LOVE was finished after five furlongs.
