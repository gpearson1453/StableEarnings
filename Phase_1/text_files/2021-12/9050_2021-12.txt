Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE ERICA away in good order, narrowly showed the way into the turn, came in the two path into the stretch while still setting the pace, held the
runner up at bay in the run to the wire under steady handling. LIL MISS HOT MESS settled off the pace, saved ground when inching closer late in the turn,
challenged inside the winner when straightened for home, outdueled to the wire, clearly second best. DIVA DE KELA lacked early foot outside, raced four
wide through the turn, continued widest for the drive, narrowly up for the show while not a threat to the top two. MARY ALICE broke sharp, pressed winner
in the two path into the turn, floated out a bit to be three wide into the stretch, weakened, nipped late for the show. CUSTOM FOR CARLITA last away,
raced outside up the backstretch, gradually worked way to the rail by late in the turn, some interest late to miss the show. HONEY PARADE forwardly
placed while three wide four three furlongs, gave way in the drive. ARROWSPHERE in the second flight three wide, had little left for the stretch run in
backing up.

Footnotes
REQUISITION asked a bit out of the gate to press the issue off the inside and between horses into and through the first turn, continued to force the pace up
the backstretch and into the far turn, took over entering the stretch and drove steadily clear. JIM AND JIM prompted early four wide through the first turn,
second group the middle half, set down for the drive, up late for the place while in the three path for most of the stretch. LOOKINFOREXCITEMEN broke
well, narrowly showed the way through the first turn, garnered a slightly larger advantage after a half, offered little resistance to the winner in upper stretch,
caught late for the place. POPSTER with the early pace along the inside, fell back after a half, went evenly to the wire. DECLARE THE MOON off the pace
along the inside, continued to save ground through the second turn, improved a bit into the lane without making a significant impact. SPEND AGAIN in mid
pack while off the inside, moved out a bit to the three wide into the lane, came up empty in the drive. BEACH HOLIDAY void of speed off the inside, passed
tiring rivals without a posing a serious threat. INDIA TIGER remained back in failing to threaten. BIG PETE back off the early pace outside, four wide trip
throughout, faded. TEQUILA REVOLUTION was always outrun.

Footnotes
WILD BEHAVIOR broke on top, set a quick pace up the backstretch closest to the inside, shook off the other speed late in the turn, responded soon after
when the runner up came along side, long drive to the wire, dug in late in game fashion to narrowly prevail in game fashion. AWESOME SATURDAY closest
to the dueling leaders, moved closer three wide late in the turn, engaged the winner turning for home, drifted out slightly past the furlong marker, continued
to duel, not enough for that one in the late going. PIT BOSS last to leave, trailed in the run up the backstretch, came four wide into the lane, finished up
willingly down the middle of the strip to be getting to the top two. YODEL E. A. WHO off the pace while saving ground, two path into the lane, set down,
lacked a serious closing response. LONELY PRIVATE broke with the winner, pressed that one tightly from the outside in the run up the backstretch, gave
way turning for home from between horses. EAGLE PASS showed little while racing outside.

Footnotes
CHICKEN HAWK broke alertly, set the pace in hand along the inside, clear exiting the turn, maintained a daylight advantage through the lane under steady
handling. RUBIGINOUS pressed the winner off the inside, could do little with that one in chasing that one through the stretch, held sway for the second spot
late. HARD TO PARK lacked speed just off the inside, dropped inside when improving into the stretch, along for the show. FUNANDFUNNY in the second
flight while along the inside, went evenly in the drive. WISE KHOZAN off a step slow, raced back, angled out five wide into the lane, improved position down
the middle part of the strip while too late. AXIS broke back, lacked speed, saved ground turning for home while in a bit of some traffic, also improved
position down the lane. KAT'S HITMAN in mid pack while racing outside, four wide through the turn, lacked a closing response while remaining out in the
strip. MY LITTLE TIPSY void of speed, four out to five wide turning for home, failed to rally. PAPA STAR in the second flight while between rivals, faded
through the stretch. WISECRACK tired while racing three wide. FAMILIAR WAYS behind the pace off the inside, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED TWISTER stalked off the inside, took over when straightened for home, shook well clear under steady handling. MY DAMS ATITUDE lacked
speed while racing outside, three out to four wide by late in the turn, five wide into the lane, up for the place while not a threat to the winner. CHOCTAW
CHARLIE within striking distance in the run up the backstretch, moved closer three wide by late in the turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker,
weakened while proving no match for that one, caught late for the place. HALF SCOUT back off the pace inside, asked along turn, went evenly through the
stretch in lacking a closing kick. LITTLE BURRITO in mid pack while off the inside, floated out three path turning for home, made little impact through the
lane to also finish up evenly. FRANKIES MOONSHINE in the second group while along the inside and within striking distance up the backstrech, came out a
bit late in the turn, had little left for the stretch turn. OLIVIAN bumped at the break but managed to break near the front, showed the way up the backstretch,
gave way when headed by the winner in upper stretch. SAILAWAY AND HIDE broke out, bumped a rival to be off slowly, continued to trail into the turn,
three wide into the stretch, failed to muster a rally. COURAGEOUS CAPPEN finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
BOTSWANA unhurried for six furlongs while off the inside, two path into the far turn, tipped out four wide when beginning to advance exiting the final bend,
closed steadily to engage the leader with a sixteenth remaining, wore that foe down late and then had enough to hold the runner up safe in the final strides.
TEZ back off the pace and the inside, closer in the two path turning for home, in a bit tight when splitting rivals past the furlong marker, finished willingly to
be getting to the top two late while between that pair at the wire. JACK'S ADVANTAGE broke sharp, dueled early off the inside, prompted the issue in hand
in the run up the backstretch, advanced and took over turning for home, clear upper stretch, could not last. FLATOUTJUSTICE settled off the pace while
well off the inside, remained with striking distance into and through the final turn, came up empty for the drive. RYE HUMOR in the second group while
saving some ground in the first turn, pulled, had nothing for the drive. ISTILLGOTIT away well, dueled into the first turn, briefly clear late in the first turn,
continued to set the pace up the backstretch, weakened readily when headed exiting the final turn. ALTITO last to leave, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
HYPERSPORT broke alertly, set the pace inside, shook clear entering the stretch, maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire while being steadily kept
to task. FIREWOLVES within striking distance off the inside, three wide through the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clearly second best.
ICE ORCHID in mid pack while toward the inside, angled out four wide turning for home to lose considerable ground to the winner, along for the show late
while not a serious threat to the top two. LITTLE MOMBO pressed the issue up front off the inside, weakened. ROLL BABY settled off the pace along the
inside, failed to muster a response in the drive. SWEET BEAUTY broke back, improved slightly while two out to three wide in the turn, not dangerous
through the stretch. RED QUEEN saved ground to no avail. CLAY'S CLOUD BURST off a step slow, raced back and well off the inside, bothered a bit when
SWEET BEAUTY came out midway on the turn, remained back through the stretch. WICKED WONDER was finished after a half.

Footnotes
KAVOD a bit slow to settle in the run to the turn, crept closer late in the bend, eased out in the two path and waited briefly into the lane, challenged the
leader past the furlong marker, edging clear to finish up willingly. HIGHER STANDARD close from the start off the inside, moved to duel through the turn,
showed the way into the lane, briefly clear in upper stretch, could not contain the winner, held sway for the place. CAIRAMA back off the pace and the
inside, three wide through the turn, set down for the drive, lugged in a bit nearing the furlong grounds, righted, slowly getting to the runner up late. RUGGS
within striking distance while off the inside, three wide through the turn, came up empty for the drive. FORTY STRIPES went one paced while racing off the
inside, lacked a closing kick. IMPULSUS last away, trailed much of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a factor.
SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY broke back, checked up early when in tight, remained always back while racing three wide. ORO AZTECA broke alertly, set the
pace along the inside until headed by the runner up entering the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
JETS A GINNIN pressed the issue off the inside, brush, three wide turning for home, engaged the leader nearing the furlong marker, finished with good
resolve to be pulling clear late. PALM COTTAGE behind the pace toward the inside, continued to force the pace into the stretch, bothered when the leader
lugged out past the furlong marker, recovered and and outkicked that same foe for the place. MIZ BLUE broke alertly, set the pace along the inside,
continued to show the way into the lane, lugged out when holding a small advantage with a furlong to run, proved no match for the winner, gave ground
grudgingly for the second spot. CODE NAME KATE off the early pace toward the inside, moved closer in some traffic late in the turn, flattened out in the
drive to finish up evenly. SHEZ STUCK UP back off the pace and the inside, three wide turning for home, improved position while not a serious threat.
FLASH MAGIC back off the pace while racing outside, four wide into the stretch, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. URSULINA off a step
slow, raced back while four wide midway on the turn, moved in a bit late in the bend, failed to muster a kick. ATHENAS SONG shuffled back early, raced
outside, continued to trail through the lane.
