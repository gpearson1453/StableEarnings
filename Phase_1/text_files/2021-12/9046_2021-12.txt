Footnotes
BULL MEECHUM broke sharply and exchanged light contact with PRINCE JACOB then set a pressured pace, contested the edge three wide on the turn,
drew clear approaching the head of the lane and widened of his own initiative the final sixteenth. The latter was jostled at the break then pressured the pace
between horses, dropped back off the rail nearing the top of the stretch and, while no match for the winner, held well in second. MIO GRACELAND engaged
in close early chase inside, lost momentum at the rail leaving the five sixteenths pole, ran two deep on the turn and finished well while dueling for third.
ATRANI angled out to give chase, rounded the turn about the five path then flattened inside the eighth pole. WEAVE IT QUIXOTE angled to the outside to
give chase, raced in the five path of the turn then lugged in through the upper stretch. CEDAR RUNS CASTLE exchanged light contact with Prince Jacob
leaving the gate then pressured the pace, raced close at the rail to the mid point of the turn, but dropped back toward the head of the lane and weakened
the final furlong.

Footnotes
BONNIE BLUETOOTH broke outward to make contact with HOOK THE CHAIN then stalked off the rail, rallied from the seven sixteenths pole to take over
nearing the three eighths, contested the edge two deep on the turn, drifted toward the top of the lane but dug in when straightened away, dueled clear later
yards and held on well. The latter was jostled leaving the gate and rounded the opening turn in the three path, settled close into the backstretch then bid
toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path, eased to the four path entering the stretch and dug in to take the nod for second under
the wire. IHEARTRAINACOMN raced boxed at the rail the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, started a bid past the seven sixteenths pole,
raced off the rail on the far turn, angled out from the heels of Bonnie Bluetooth mid-stretch and was nipped from second under the wire. SOOEY'S
PRINCESS broke in to make contact with Hook The Chain and rounded the first turn about the four path, raced outside into the backstretch, bid toward the
three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the six path and finished evenly outside. HAZY WINTER settled off the pace inside on the first turn,
picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and finished evenly. PETTYFORURTHOUGHTS drew clear and
angled to the rail to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was caught and gave chase toward the three eighths, contested
even terms at the rail on the far turn then weakened nearing mid-stretch. LOVETHEONEYOUGOT settled back off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase
toward the three eighths pole and ran in the four path of the far turn.

relented second later yards. UNDENIABLE TOUCH chased and rounded the turn off the rail, was carried outward into the lane, finished well and was
gaining on third. COUNTRY MAGIC came in to make contact with Lunar Prayer leaving the gate then chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in

Footnotes
CAIRO CALLING veered sharply in across the path of the tardy breaking Tapping South then closed to the lead at the three eighths pole, drew clear nearing
the quarter pole and was steadily handled through the lane. SUPER JORDAN broke outward across the path of the tardy breaking Morning Artie then gave
chase, raced off the rail on the turn, though, settled for second best. SLOE GIN BIZ broke sharply with a brief lead then gave chase through the backstretch,
raced in the five path of the turn then flattened in the lane. BUCKS LODGE broke a step slow then picked up the chase leaving the chute, rounded the turn
at the rail and finished evenly to improve his position. SMELLSLIKEMONEY gave chase outside then flattened in the five path of the turn. ANGUSONIC set
a pressured early pace, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the turn. MOTIVATED SPEAKER was not a factor. TAPPING
SOUTH broke a step slow and was not a factor. MORNING ARTIE broke a step slow and was not a factor.
