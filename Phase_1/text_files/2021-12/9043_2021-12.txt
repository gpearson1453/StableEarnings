RUNNING FOR GOLD was hustled to engage SHACK'S CHICA LOCA on the front end soon after the break, dueled with that foe on the turn, put away the
rival pacesetter leaving the turn, was challenged through the lane but dug in and held in a good debut. ROCK N ROLL SONG stalked the dueling
pacesetters through the turn, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch, vied between foes in the late going and was outfinished by the winner while holding
for second. DIZZY LIZZY sat off of the early pace while two wide on the turn and while not able to reel in the top pair closed well in the stretch to claim third.
BALI BRAVA was away a bit slowly and was hustled to chase the early pace, mounted a four wide bid on the turn to vie for the lead leaving the bend but
was outkicked in the late going. DANCING TILL DAWN had no early speed, was two wide on the turn and passed tiring foes in the stretch run. SHACK'S
CHICA LOCA was away alertly, dueled on the front end while two wide through the turn and weakened in the stretch run. SCREAMIN EMERY settled
toward the rear of the field while saving ground, made a mild gain off of the turn, was blocked nearing the furlong marker and did not have a late response in
the stretch run.

Footnotes
SHE'S SO PRETTY sat just off of the early pace while rating nicely, saved ground on the second turn along the inside, was roused leaving the second turn
to split horses inside of the furlong marker, wore down PROOF OF JAZZ in the final sixteenth and edged clear in the end. PROOF OF JAZZ was away well
and set the fractions under a tight hold, led into the lane and battled back against the oncoming winner in the final sixteenth but could not hold her off while
clear of the rest in a game effort. CONVINCE was forwardly placed through the second turn while stalking the pace, mounted a four wide bid leaving the
second turn and was outfinished in the late stages. INDIAN DANCER settled near the rear of the field while saving ground, improved position while two wide
on the second turn and was outkicked in the stretch run. FRIEND OF AUTISM was unhurried in the early going while traveling near the rear, gained ground
while three wide on the second turn but finished evenly in the stretch drive. MISS INDEFATIGABLE prompted the pace through the second turn from a three
wide path, was still in contention leaving the second turn but weakened in the stretch run. SAY IT WITH ROSES was carried out four wide on the first turn,
stalked the pace into the second turn while five wide and did not mount a late bid in the stretch drive. MISS YOU MOM had no early speed, saved ground
into the second turn and did not rally in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
RIDEO sat just off of the early pace, was between foes on the backstretch and into the second turn while three wide, confronted START A RUNNIN inside of
the sixteenth marker, dug in against that determined foe and won the nod in the end. START A RUNNIN stalked the pace through the second turn from a
two wide position, got by HYPERSONIC inside of the furlong marker, was confronted by RIDEO nearing the sixteenth marker and battled determinedly but
was outfinished in the end while holding for second. UPO tracked the pace into the second turn while saving ground and closed well in the stretch to win the
nod for the show. HYPERSONIC contested the early pace with START A RUNNIN, then shook free of that foe along the backstretch, was confronted inside
of the furlong marker and was outfinished, while just missing for the show. FOUR O'FIVE saved ground throughout while settling at the rear of the field and
was not a factor. SUNNY SPOT was reluctant to load, made a middle move to sit just off of the pace on the backstretch, gave ground on the second turn
while four wide and lacked a late response in the stretch run.

DRINKING AGAIN sat off of the early pace into the turn, swung out for the drive, confronted GO THRU THE HOLE inside of the sixteenth marker and
determinedly got by the runner-up to prevail. GO THRU THE HOLE tracked the pace through the turn from a three wide position, gained ground on
COUNTRY DUDE leaving the turn, took the lead from that foe inside of the furlong marker, could not hold off DRINKING AGAIN in the final stages but
bested the rest. COUNTRY DUDE was away alertly and set the fractions from a two wide path, was pressured by GO THRU THE HOLE leaving the turn,
was caught nearing the furlong marker but kept on to hold the show. RUNNING ON EMPTY had no early speed while saving ground on the turn and closed
willingly in the stretch to just miss for third. LYING GHOST tracked the pace from an inside position and weakened in the stretch run. TOM'S BIRTHDAY
stalked the pace through the turn from a three to four wide position and tired in the drive.

GRIGORO stalked the pace into the second turn, mounted a three wide bid leaving the turn to vie for the lead, was clear into the final sixteenth and held
over a surging runner-up to prevail. ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) settled toward the rear of the field while under a snug hold through the backstretch, saved
ground on the second turn, swung out for the drive, surged in the final sixteenth and just missed for the win, while holding for the place. LAST INNING was a
bit rank and keen in the early going, saved ground while sitting just off of the pace through the second turn, improved position through the stretch but was
outfinished by the top two. BANDEENA prompted the pace while two wide through the second turn, vied for the lead into the stretch but was outkicked in the
late going. SUGAR KISSES settled toward the rear, was two wide on the second turn and did not rally in the late going. MALIBU HANNAH set all of the
pace into the second turn while being pressured and weakened in the stretch run.

MAGICAL GRAY settled off of the early pace, mounted a four wide bid on the turn, was asked for run under firm left-handed encouragement and dug in in
the final strides to prevail. QUEEN OF THE TRACK was away well and set the pace from the inside, extended the lead leaving the turn, was clear into the
final sixteenth but was tagged in the final strides while besting the rest. THIS IS THE ONE was forwardly placed early while stalking the pace from a three
wide path, gave a bit of ground to QUEEN OF THE TRACK off of the turn and was outkicked in the late going. BIG CHICK was shuffled at the start and had
no early speed, was three wide on the turn and closed willingly in the stretch drive. LIAM'S SECRET stalked the pace from a two wide position and did not
have a late response in the drive. BLACK DROP pressed the pace while two wide on the turn, gave ground leaving the bend and weakened in the stretch.
AMBA chased the pace from a three wide position on the turn and tired in the stretch run. KISS RIDE GOODBYE saved ground while offering no early
speed and did not mount a late rally in the drive.

MAYBE I WILL was away alertly and set the quick pace while in hand from an inside position, extended the lead off of the turn, drew clear and was geared
down in the late stages. LAGATHA stalked the pace through the turn and closed in the stretch to win the nod for the place. SEEMS LOGICAL saved ground
while chasing from the rear in the early going, rallied along the inside and closed well in the stretch, just missing for second. QUEEN MOLOTOV was in tight
leaving the break and steadied on the run into the backstretch, was five wide on the turn and made a good rally in the stretch but was unable to reel in the
leaders in the late going. BACK ON THE STREET chased the pace from the second flight while three wide on the turn and finished willingly in the stretch
run. TIGER QUEEN tracked the pace through the turn from a three wide path, lost ground off of the turn and tired in the stretch. VEGAN chased from the
second flight on the turn, took up inside of the sixteenth marker in tight quarters and lacked a late response. CRYSTAL PROOF saved ground while stalking
the pace through the turn and weakened in the stretch run. SQUARED SHADY chased the pace from a five wide position on the turn and gave way in the
stretch. SEVEN SISTERS tracked the early pace, lost ground on the turn while four wide and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
SILVER CLAIM sped to an early advantage while saving ground on the turn, shook free of A MAN'S MAN leaving the turn and kicked clear in the end to
prevail. A MAN'S MAN stalked SILVER CLAIM while four wide on the turn, closed the gap on that foe heading into the lane but was turned away nearing the
furlong marker and kept on to be a clear second best. R M C HOOK'EM chased the fractions from the second flight, gained ground while four wide on the
turn but was outkicked by the top pair in the stretch run. TOM'S SURPRISE had no early speed, improved position while two wide on the turn and closed
willingly in the stretch run, just missing the show. PHANTOM DROP tracked the early pace while three wide between foes, lost ground leaving the turn and
gave way in the stretch run. THEGLORYISALLMINE chased the early pace, was two wide on the turn, was climbing and not striding out nearing the head of
the stretch and tired in the late stages. POSO CREEK chased the early pace, lost ground while inside on the turn and weakened in the stretch run. SMILING
TONY had no early speed, lost ground on the turn while three wide and was not a factor.

PAINT ME LUCKY was off alertly and set the early pace into the backstretch, ceded the lead to TRASH TALKIN CAT on the backstretch, saved ground on
the second turn, swung out for the drive and had a late kick to get by the runner-up and held to prevail. VANTAGE POINT sat just off of the early fractions,
pulled on the rider along the backstretch, mounted a three wide bid on the second turn to take the lead into the lane, was collared by the winner inside of the
final furlong and could not hold him off but was well clear of the rest. AWESOME DUDE bumped TRASH TALKIN CAT on the run into the first turn, settled in
the second flight through the backstretch, improved position while three wide on the second turn but was outkicked in the stretch run, while getting up in time
for third. THATSABADBOY was forwardly placed through the second turn while two wide, gained ground off of the turn but tired in the drive and just missed
for third. SPACE ODESSEY stumbled a bit at the start, steadied on the first turn while in tight quarters, was two wide between foes on the second turn and
was empty in the stretch run. HAMMERING LEMON stalked the early pace then took back to settle in the second flight down the backstretch, saved ground
on the second turn and gave way in the drive. TRASH TALKIN CAT was bumped by AWESOME DUDE along the first turn, made a middle move to take
over the pace along the backstretch, led to the three-quarter marker but was confronted by VANTAGE POINT nearing the head of the lane and weakened in
the late stages. HARBOR SKY stumbled sharply at the start and settled at the rear of the field, was three wide on the second turn and did not offer a late
rally in the stretch run.
