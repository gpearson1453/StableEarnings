Footnotes
SWEET QUEEN BEE sharp speed, dueled inside to turn, perfectly handled, prevailed. LETSGOANDGETTHEDO no speed to turn, shifted out widest with a
rush too late. STACY ATTACK raced back never far back, drifted out in the drive. LOST WISH just off leaders to turn, led between calls stretch, weakened.
DEEP DISH raced evenly while lacking the late response needed. THROMBOCYTOPENIA taken back quickly, stayed wide with a mild late run.
CANDYCREAM dueled from two path, gave way into the stretch used up. AMAZING DANCER never menaced. FANTASTIC RIVA through early from
outside, dropped well back. MIRACLE STRIKE through early, gave way readily. EIDA'S STORM no speed while outside in the stretch run never a factor.
