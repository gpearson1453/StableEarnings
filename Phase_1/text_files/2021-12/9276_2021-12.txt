Footnotes
NYOMAN was rated along the inside early off the pace setters, swung out four wide for the drive, closed well to edge away late under a drive. MARCO'S
DREAM pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid in the drive, but could not go with the winner late, second best. CRANKSHAFT set a pressured
pace along the inside and faded late, bested rest. TALIS PARK GRAD tracked the early pace and was four wide by the quarter pole, came five wide into the
drive and had no kick. GALAHAD KID was void of early speed and showed some late interest on the inside. EASTER MUSIC was settled four wide and had
no rally. CONTRACTION was settled between rivals and lacked a rally. ONCEWEWEREBROTHERS had no response while on the inside.
