Footnotes
SOMBRA NEGRA was bumped at the start, set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and held sway to
the wire. BEDROCK was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, could not reach the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. NEVADAN
was bumped at the break, pressed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. KING PARKER was forwardly placed early, moved
three-wide through the turn and finished evenly. MIKE MAN'S GOLD settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally.
WRITE ITINTHE DUST lagged early, raced five-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. SAND WALKER was void of early speed, raced
three-wide through the turn and did not threaten.

MINE ME was away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter and drew off. FABULOUS
FORUM was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. RED VENUS was off slow, raced
unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with a belated bid. SHIP'S CREEK was forwardly placed early,
saved ground through the turn and finished evenly late. COASTAL RUN sprinted clear at once, saved ground through the turn and weakened. SMOOTH
RITHMS showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT GARDEN pressed the pace of ARIES while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths marker, opened a clear margin
with a quarter to run and was ridden out to the wire. NORTH OF EDEN was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn,
angled out into the stretch and finished willingly. LILA'S LUCKY LADY was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled in with a
furlong to run and finished evenly. ARIES set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the half, angled out into the stretch and gave
way. WAVERLY WAY was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. LINDA'S BALLET settled off the leaders
throughout and gradually weakened.

N. K. ROCKET MAN sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and was ridden out through the lane. LAUNCH PAD settled off the
leaders early, saved ground through the turn, was bumped and checked nearing the quarter and finished with a late bid. DOODLE TIME was away alertly to
chase the leaders while racing three-wide throughout and lacked the needed closing response. CAPTAIN RED showed no early speed, raced six-wide
through the turn and finished with some late run. STEAL HOME raced just off the leaders early, was bumped and bobbled nearing the quarter and did not
threaten. AUDACE was never far back, raced four-wide through the second turn and failed to gain late. FULL VELOCITY was checked at the start, saved
ground through the turn and did not reach contention. TALENT AND TRICKS raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn,
angled out further into the stretch and weakened. MY PAL lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERING THE BUMPING AND STEADYIING BETWEEN LAUNCH PAD AND STEAL HOME NEARING THE QUARTER
AND AFTER REVEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE. RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

STONE TOP was bumped at the start, opened a clear margin before going a quarter, raced off the rail while setting the pace and drew off with complete
authority. KID CAT was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner late but finished well for the
place. PLUM WILD chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. BIG CALI GIRL was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide
through the turn and finished evenly. BODE'S BEST was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

clear lead with a furlong to run and drew off with complete authority. OPTIMISTIC VALOR pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, was no
match for that rival in the drive but finished well hold the place. CHEST CANDY was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and
finished with some late run. STITZY settled off the leaders from the inside early, drifted out nearing the seven-eighths marker, moved three-wide through the
second turn and finished evenly late. MAD AT MONEY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. EAST
RAND steadied nearing the seven-eighths marker, showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not menace. BOB'S ALL IN
lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. BIG BARREL was forwardly placed from the inside and gradually
weakened. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERNING THE STEADYING OF EAST RAND NEARING THE SEVEN-EIGHTHS POLE
