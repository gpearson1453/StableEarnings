Footnotes
TUFFOLOGY set the pace along the inside while staying a path off of the inner railing around the turn, clung to a margin from a chasing SHE'S A FAIR
CATCH in upper stretch, changed leads at the furlong grounds, and held sway from that foe and her bidding entry-mate. MY GIRL EM pressed her stable
mate two wide and from between horses early on, but backed off to stalk into the turn, chased while floated three wide entering the lane, stayed on through
the final furlong to take aim on her entry-mate late, but failed to reel that foe in while gaining place. SHE'S A FAIR CATCH broke inwardly, tracked the pace
along the inside, tipped outside of the leader in upper stretch, but was denied reaching that rival through the final furlong, and lost place to an outer foe late.
MIDNIGHT TRIP took a bump to her hind quarters from an outer foe soon after the start, chased the leader three wide, but failed to keep pace passing the
quarter pole. HANGING LAKE settled at the rear along the inside, shifted five wide in upper stretch, but lacked a rally. JUANANDORA was forced inwardly
by an outer foe into an inner rival, tracked four wide, but got floated six wide in upper stretch while tiring. IBEGTODIFFER laid at the rear two wide, swung
seven wide entering the lane, and never got involved.

Footnotes
GOINGTOAGOGO was bumped by an outer foe at the start, rated off of the pace in the five to four path around the first turn, inched closer to track the pace
three wide around the far turn, got floated five wide entering the lane, grinded away outside of foes to bid approaching the final sixteenth, edged past inner
foes while dueling with RUNAWAY HENNY to the wire, and prevailed. RUNAWAY HENNY tracked from midpack in the two path, shifted four wide entering
the lane while inside of GOINGTOAGOGO, ranged up to inner foes in the final furlong to bid along the with that rival a sixteenth from home, dueled
thereafter, but was outfinished. ARTISTIC JEWLER stalked two wide, vied around the far turn, then from between horses through upper stretch, but was
outkicked by a pair of outer foes a the sixteenth pole, then held show. QUEEN'S MISSION tracked three wide, stalked the leading pair around the far turn,
ranged up to them at the three sixteenths pole, vied into the final furlong, but was outkicked by outer foes at the sixteenth marker, then flattened out and
missed reaching show. PERFECT DIVA stalked along the inside, chased from behind the leading group through midstretch while shifting four wide, and
failed to produce a bid. VARSITY FLYGIRL set a clear pace down the backstretch, showed the way from a vying foe around the far turn, got headed by a
pair of rivals in upper stretch, then weakened at the furlong grounds. BEAUTIFUL BELLA broke slowly, trailed early on, and never got involved.
NOFANSINTHESTANDS broke inwardly and bumped a foe a the start, then was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
C F JOHNATHAN settled off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide entering the lane, and rallied to drive past the tiring leader in the final sixteenth.
MUSADA pulled clear around the first turn, remained unsettled down the backstretch, showed the way from a pressing foe around the far turn, drew off
passing the quarter pole, but drifted outwardly while tiring entering the final furlong, and was worn down in the final sixteenth. I DON'T FLY COACH stalked
two wide, then along the inside around the far turn, and stayed on while chasing the leader. STARVICTORY saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail.
CRYPTORITHM pulled along the rail into the backstretch to stalk inside of the leader, shifted outside of that foe into the far turn to press, but failed to keep
pace turning for home, and weakened entering the lane. AMBASSADOR HOUSE stalked three wide, but weakened into the far turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
SILENT TAP stalked two wide, was scrubbed upon to press into the turn, bid entering the lane, drew clear of his inner counterpart passing the quarter pole,
and held sway from that rival to the wire. ZIPPIN GIGI set the pace along the inside, showed the way inside of SILET TAP around the far turn, but was
headed by that foe at the quarter pole, then fought on thereafter, but was unable to produce a re-bid. SHADYFIED settled off of the pace in the three path,
shifted to the four path turning for home, improved outside of foes to claim show in upper stretch, and stayed on to chase the leading pair home. ASSET
TALENT broke slowly, saved ground while trailing, but failed to kick through tight quarters between horses in upper stretch, and made little impact. SILVER
NUGGETS tracked two to three wide, but failed to keep pace with the leading pair turning for home, and weakened through the lane. SIDE BAR (IRE)
stalked along the inside, but faded turning for home, and weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
CITIZEN WEST was last away while bumping an outer foe at the start, but quickly rushed to set the pace, drew off from a pressing rival in upper stretch, and
drifted outwardly through the final furlong while inching further away. DESOTO'S WAR pressed the pace setter from the outside, but proved no match for
that foe in upper stretch, and held place. CHIEF CHEETAH chased two wide and between horses into the turn, but was outmoved by an inner foe entering
the lane, shifted to the rail passing the quarter pole, then chase along the inside while failing to reach an outer foe for place. CITADEL stalked along the
inside, shifted outside of the leading pair in upper stretch, but lacked a bid between horses. CYPRIANO bobbled slightly before being bumped by an inner
foe at the start, tracked the pace three wide, got floated four wide in upper stretch, and failed to factor. FIFTYFIVE STRONG was outrun.

PRACTICE SQUAD settled off of the pace two wide, tracked five wide around the far turn, rallied outside of foes to bid approaching the final furlong, and
drove clear passing that marker. WORDS OF WISDOM stalked along the inside, slipped inside of the leading pair at the three sixteenths pole, led briefly,
but was outkicked by an outer rival at the furlong grounds, and was second best. FAITH RUNNER tracked from midpack three wide, but faltered among
rivals into the far turn to trail the field, swung six wide entering the lane while re-gaining stride, and rallied for a minor share. MINNESOTA READY saved
ground off of the pace, stayed on along the rail through midstretch to claim show at the sixteenth pole, but was outfinished by an outer foe for that position.
RULE THE EMPIRE stalked three wide, vied outside of BALTIC FLEET while being kept in the three path around the far turn, but bumped with that rival
while getting outkicked by an inner foe at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened between horses. BALTIC FLEET set the pace two wide around the first
turn, cleared into the backstretch but stayed in the two path, showed the way from a vying outer foe around the far turn, bumped with that rival as another
foe produced an inside bid at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened. EAST OF INDIA vied along the inside around the first turn, took back to stalk two
wide into the backstretch, but chased from between horses into the far turn, and made little impact thereafter. SEEKING SPLENDOR trailed, improved five
wide into the backstretch, chased from the four path around the far turn while in range, but tired between horses in upper stretch.

SERAPE set the pace along the inside, met CANADA'S CUSTOMS' bid around the far turn, but repelled that foe in upper stretch, shook clear, and held
sway. ANITA'S VISION bobbled at the start, recovered to a two wide stalking position into the first turn, chased the leading pair from the outside around the
far turn, then stayed on in the late stages to catch a tiring foe for place on the wire. CANADA'S CUSTOMS pressed the pace two wide, vied around the far
turn, but was repelled by the leader in upper stretch, tired thereafter, and was nailed on the wire for place. SUPER ET stalked along the inside under a tight
rein, but faded around the far turn. WHIMSICAL LADY saved ground at the rear, but to no avail. CONNECT IT laid at the rear two wide, and never got
involved. BODE'S CONNECTION tracked three wide, but was done early.

Footnotes
BIARRITZ vied two wide, led entering the lane, drew off at the three sixteenths pole, tired in the closing stages as INTIMIDATION menaced, but lasted to
the wire. INTIMIDATION tracked two wide, gained three wide turning for home, stayed on while taking aim on a clear BIARRITZ in the final furlong, gained
late as that rival tired, but ran out of ground. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE chased under urging while off of the pace along the inside, shifted four wide in upper
stretch, and stayed on late to claim show. TAPIZARS SECRET stalked along the inside, aimed between the leading pair entering the lane, but lacked a kick
to split them, shifted back inwardly passing the quarter pole before altering course back two wide at the three sixteenths pole to maneuver around
COMMADER KHAI, but only managed to chase through the lane. COMMANDER KHAI set the pace inside of a vying BIARRITZ, floated that foe a few paths
outwardly entering the lane, but shifted back inwardly after being headed at the quarter pole, and weakened. PRETTY BOY ELM broke slowly and was
outrun.

Footnotes
LETSTAKEITOUTSIDE vied along the inside, led at the quarter pole, and drew off in upper stretch. MAGIC LIGHTNING broke slowly, but recovered to stalk
along the inside, shifted three wide in upper stretch to split rivals, took aim on the clear leader at the furlong grounds, but was only second best. SCORING
DRIVE vied two wide and between horses, failed to keep pace before chasing those foes from the outside around the turn, rebid entering the lane, but was
outpaced again while getting floated four wide in upper stretch, and kept on to secure show. INTO WISHING bumped an inner foe, stumbled, and was
jostled among rivals at the start, saved ground around the bend while far off of the pace, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and rallied for a minor share.
NICE STAR vied three wide, led two wide around the turn, but hung on his left lead while weakening in upper stretch. BODEE BODEE chased four wide, but
faded around the turn. MY LITTLE LEO bumped with an outer foe at the start, then saved ground in midpack before fading. CHEROKEE TAKEOVER
bumped and was pinched back at the start, then never got involved. CLASSIC'S OMEGA failed to factor. ROCK STAR ALEX made little impact. LS'SHOE'S
IMAGE bumped an inner rival soon after the start, laid off of the pace in the three to four path, and was eased through the final furlong.
