BELLA'S BACK was away in good order to duel for the lead with TOP HAT HIGH JINKS while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin into the stretch and
was ridden out to increase her advantage. TOP HAT HIGH JINKS broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner from the inside, angled out in
mid-stretch, was no match for that foe but held on to save the place. THECHAMPISFLORING was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and
finished with some late run. DANCE FIGHTER showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter, did not
reach contention, bled and was vanned off. ABRAA JABRAA settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened.

CITY AT NIGHT sprinted clear at once, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off through the lane as a handy winner. THIRSTY KISS was
reserved just off the leaders from the inside, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. STORMY SUMMIT pressed the
pace while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. PRETTY LOUD was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a
factor. TRAPALIS was off a step slow, lagged early, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not menace. BALI STAR was forwardly placed early,
moved four-wide through the second turn and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
NOT NECESSARILY was away in good order to duel for the lead WARFRONT while racing three-wide, vied with that rival into deep stretch and drew off
late. WARFRONT FIGHTER disputed the pace with the winner from the inside, vied through a prolonged drive but could not stay with that rival late.
MYBESTISYETTOCOME was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. PAST LIFE
was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. SUPER INTENSE was void of early foot, raced five-wide
through the turn and finished evenly late. SMOKIN ARROW was off slow, settled off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened. SCRATCH ME
showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and was not a factor. TIN CAN BUDDY was slow to begin and lagged throughout.

Footnotes
PRICE TO PAY raced five-wide through the first turn, lagged early, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter and drew off through the lane. SILENT
MUSKETIER was away in good order to duel for the lead with HAVEULOSTYOURMIND while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by the winner
approaching the stretch and gave way in the drive. VODKA TWIST chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive.
HAVEULOSTYOURMIND was away in good order to dispute the pace from the inside and weakened after going five furlongs. MUSKYMAN was void of
early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.
