Footnotes
BLONDE BY NATURE pressed the early pace, rallied at the quarter pole and drew close, edged clear late under firm handling. LA MUNECA was away
alertly and quickly set the pace, was hooked in mid stretch, gave way grudgingly late and held place. SPECIAL BEACH had good position on the inside,
angled out in mid stretch and finished willingly. HERE AND VOW tracked three wide and had no rally. IT'S ALL CASH was off slowly and was no threat.
NAITAKA allowed to settle, failed to menace. RUNNING ROSADO was no factor.

stretch and finished well to be up for place. ANGEL WINGS raced mid pack early, had a mild bid late. MISSION GIRL was off slowly, and was no threat.
SORORITY SISTER chased the winner and weakened in mid stretch. BIRDIE'S CHANTZ raced wide early and was no menace. DANZA MAGIC was no
factor. HAKABUMBUM raced close up early and was through after a half. SHOSHA SHOSHA flashed brief foot and gave way.
