Footnotes
GHOST STALKER was rated off the second flight just off the inside racing to the first turn, switched out four deep racing through the backstretch, was
prompted to advance outside foes racing into the far turn, moved to challenge for command racing into upper stretch and wrested the advantage leaving the
furlong marker to go clear under firm left handed encouragement. DOHKO was urged along the rail dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the
backstretch, went clear after a half, resisted the winner's bid nearing upper stretch to press the issue to midstretch but proved no match late. INDIAN BUZZ,
urged to contend three deep between foes racing to the first turn, tracked off the first flight outside a rival on the backstretch, shifted out three deep racing
into the lane but lacked the needed final response. SUPER EDGAR, reserved outside foes racing to the first turn, switched outside foes to race five deep
through the backstretch, then continued four wide through the far turn to late stages with an even effort. STAGE DOOR, urged to terms with the pacesetter
four wide racing into the first turn, shifted inwards racing to the backstretch pursuing the pacesetter to the second bend but soon gave way. UNCLE PIP was
settled out of close quarters at the break, continued last to the far turn, then angled five wide in the closing stages but offered no rally. WILSHIRE DIAMOND
angled to the inside stalking just off the leaders as part of the second flight but steadily faded racing into the second bend.

Footnotes
DEPUTY DORA, off a step slowly, was settled outside foes dropping well off the leaders racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into the far
turn commencing a steady advance, continued in that path to gain terms with the leaders nearing the sixteenth marker and prevailed in time under right
handed pressure. FUN PADDY angled to the inside in the opening stages tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight from just out of striking
distance into the backstretch, was prompted to advance while shifting out three wide nearing upper stretch, moved to wrest the advantage near midstretch
but couldn't contain the winner late. SUNDRENCHED sped clear along the rail from the outset, dictated the pace on a comfortable advantage racing to the
far turn, resisted several challenges while being headed racing into upper stretch but yielded to the top pair nearing the wire. CROWN OF JOY, reserved
along the inside dropping well off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out while being urged to advance between rivals racing through the far
turn, gained some position but lacked the needed closing bid. LAPULGA, held up avoiding close quarters racing into the first turn, angled to the inside on
the backstretch, saved ground to the lane but passed only tiring foes. HOLY DIVER was rated off the second flight a bit off the inside racing to the
backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into the far turn but soon emptied out. SAYOH tracked just off the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the
backstretch, steadily advanced after a half to challenge for command racing through the far turn but quickly flattened out racing into upper stretch.

Footnotes
BLACK V. K. was rated off the first flight while angling to the inside in early stages, saved ground on the turn gathering momentum, altered course slightly
nearing upper stretch to bid outside the pacesetter entering the lane, took over leaving the furlong marker and went well clear under some right handed
encouragement. OPTIMAL COURAGE, urged to contend three deep between foes prompting the pace through the backstretch, lost some ground to the
pacesetter on the turn but continued with a steady effort to prevail for the place honors late. KING ANDRES, off last, settled well off the field racing to the
turn, switched out nearing upper stretch to race five wide in the lane, shifted inwards despite left handed pressure through the last furlong and split foes
nearing the wire to narrowly prevail for a share. IMTAKINITTOTHEBANK, urged inside foes dictating the pace on a narrow advantage in the opening stages,
moved away to a clear advantage midway through the turn, dueled inside the eventual winner into upper stretch and gave way leaving the furlong marker.
HIGHLY NOTED, urged between foes prompting the pace from the outset into the turn, couldn't match the pacesetter after a half and gave way racing into
upper stretch. TIMEWON'TLETMEGO made brief pursuit of the leaders racing four wide through the backstretch and dropped out early.

Footnotes
SHALDAG broke readily to gain striking distance while coming under rating angling to the rail racing to the first turn, steadily gained position while shifting
outside foes racing into the second bend, was prompted to advance three deep nearing upper stretch, then quickly wrested the advantage and drew well
clear under firm handling. HYPE MAN was rated well off the leaders along the inside in the opening half, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and
continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. CHINA BEACH, forwardly placed three deep racing to the first turn, tracked just off the second flight
under rating to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three deep racing into the far turn to gain a brief advantage between foes but proved no match
when confronted by the winner. MONITOR MILLS broke outwards bumping PERFECT BANKER, was righted to gain a forward placing along the inside
racing to the first turn, tracked off the pacesetter inside foes on the backstretch, switched out racing into upper stretch while losing some ground to the
leaders but continued with interest to regain some position late. BLACK LIMO, off a bit slowly, settled outside foes racing to the first turn, switched out to the
three path on the backstretch while being prompted to advance, continued to gain position four wide through the far turn but had no closing bid. PERFECT
BANKER, bumped at the start, was righted to gain a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter, advanced nearing the far turn to lodge a brief bid
between foes striking the front on the second bend but quickly flattened out. MY COMPUTER, reserved off the second flight inside rivals, never gained
contention. JOHNNIE GOT JETS, caught wide racing to the first turn while moving to contest the lead, was sent clear while shifting to the inside racing to
the backstretch and soon emptied out. BYRON'S GOLD, off a bit slowly, came under pressure racing to the first turn to contend but soon retreated.

KITTEN TALES, lugged inwards a bit under light rating crossing the path of several rivals in the opening stages, angled to the rail leaving the chute to track
off the first flight, continued under patient handling to the second bend, awaited an opening racing through the far turn, then came through inside foes racing
into upper stretch to wrest a narrow advantage in time under firm right handed encouragement. WEEZY DOES IT hopped at the start, then was steadied
when bumped by LIKE NOWHERE ELSE (IRE), was rated off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide entering the far
turn while being prompted to advance, continued with a steady bid to strike the front nearing the furlong marker, resisted the winner's bid to late stages but
was just outkicked. LIKE NOWHERE ELSE (IRE) shied inwards avoiding the eventual winner exchanging contact with WEEZY in the opening stages, was
collected to track just off the leaders outside KITTEN TALES racing to the backstretch, shifted out three deep after a half while being urged to advance on
the first turn, pressed the issue in that path between foes to midstretch but couldn't match terms with the top pair late. ZURI was rated off the second flight
along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out nearing the far turn while moving to close the gap, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch but had
no closing bid. RICHEBOURG was urged prompting a rival's pace racing along the rail to the backstretch, gained the advantage after three furlongs, dueled
for command inside foes racing into the far turn and gave way between foes nearing midstretch. VARSITY KICKLINE (IRE), reserved last along the inside
early, swung outside foes racing through the far turn but offered no rally. SARATOGA LULLABY was urged prompting the pace outside a rival racing to the
first turn, continued in pursuit of that foe between rivals to the second bend and gave way nearing the lane.

SUPER SHOES angled to the inside racing to the first turn, switched out midway through that bend to track the leaders outside a rival racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance shifting out four wide nearing upper stretch, lugged in under pressure while moving to challenge for command racing
past midstretch, bumped TIZ TRIUMPHANT, then shifted inwards crossing that rival's path to gain a clear advantage in the final stages. MR. EINSTEIN was
rated along the inside as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling awaiting an opening racing into the far turn,
came through inside foes to challenge for command in upper stretch but was outkicked. TIZ TRIUMPHANT, urged to terms with the pacesetter three deep
prompting that rival into the backstretch, conceded some position after a half, was urged to press the issue in that path outside the pacesetter through the
far turn into upper stretch, was bumped midstretch, then was cut off by SUPER SHOES while losing momentum late. BEACH BANDIT, urged between foes
from the outset disputing the pace on a narrow advantage, continued to dispute the issue while drifting out racing into upper stretch and weakened leaving
midstretch while caught in tight quarters late. PRIVATE CODE settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and made an effort to gain some position
between foes in the closing stages while no real threat. MERCEDES JOE tracked the leaders three deep just off the second flight racing to the backstretch
but faded from contention early. GIOVANE'S PROMISE, urged inside rivals pressing the pace in the opening half, lost some ground to the leaders racing
into the second bend, swerved out sharply racing into upper stretch and abruptly gave way. BUSTER proved no factor. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE
RIDER OF TIZ TRIUMPHANT LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF SUPER SHOES ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH
WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY. AFTER REVIEWING THE STRETCH RUN, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED
SUPER SHOES FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HIM THIRD.

Footnotes
NEWSWORTHY was rated just off the leaders while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, switched out midway through the backstretch, advanced in
tandem with several rivals advancing with a sharp move to bid for command three deep between foes, shook clear racing into upper stretch and extended
the advantage late under pressure. HOT BLOODED tracked just off the second flight three wide to the backstretch, continued four wide through the far turn
to upper stretch but finished with interest to prove best of the others. OBIWAN, reserved along the rail, was shuffled out of tight quarters nearing the
backstretch, switched out racing three deep through the far turn and continued to improve position between foes to the end. ATREYU, off slowly, was settled
outside foes racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside after a half while moving to striking position nearing the far turn, lost some momentum when held
up behind a tiring rival racing into the far turn, came around that foe to race along the inside in upper stretch but had no closing bid. A ROSE FOR RAVEN
tracked off the first flight outside the eventual winner racing to the backstretch, advanced with that one to lodge a brief, four wide bid nearing upper stretch
but soon flattened out. SONNY SMACK settled outside foes on the backstretch, was prompted to advance swinging out five wide racing into upper stretch
but lacked the needed final bid. DRIFTWOOD was urged forcing the pace outside a rival in the opening half, dueled for command between foes racing into
the far turn and gave way racing into upper stretch. CHEYENNE'S COLONEL settled between foes racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. BRING
ME A CHECK was urged along the rail disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn and gave out abruptly racing into the lane.

Footnotes
NATIVE HAWK was urged inside rivals from the outset disputing lead through the backstretch into the turn, shook clear leaving midstretch and kicked away
under brisk right handed pressure. PROFESSIONAL, urged between foes through the backstretch disputing the lead just outside the eventual winner,
pressed that rival to midstretch but couldn't match terms in the last furlong. A COTSWOLD VILLAGE was rated just off the first flight while angling to the
inside racing through the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share. HIGH FIVE COTTON raced five
wide between foes tracking just off the first flight, then came under some rating in the second quarter, was prompted to advance four wide between foes
racing into bend and continued in that path to late stages while just outkicked for a share. SMART N INTUITIVE, prominent four wide in the opening stages,
continued in pursuit of the leaders three wide racing to upper stretch and gave way late. BOLD PAYNTER, slow to gather stride, dropped out last, saved
ground to upper stretch gaining some position but offered no closing bid. NOTACATBUTACARD broke awkwardly, then angled to the inside racing through
the backstretch but failed to seriously menace. ARRIVEDERLA, caught in close quarters three deep between foes, was shuffled backwards racing through
the backstretch and soon dropped out. BANGOR RIDGE, caught six wide in the opening stages tracking off the first flight racing to the turn, faded from
contention early. SHWEET PERSUASION briefly attended the pace three wide between foes and gave way racing into the turn.

SHE FLED THE SCENE was rated between foes in second flight tracking the pacesetter from out of striking distance for the opening five furlongs, was
prompted to advance while angling to the five path racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage in time under
firm encouragement. DONYA'S MAGIC sprinted clear of the field in the opening stages, dictated the pace remaining well off the rail through the backstretch
into upper stretch, shifted out in the closing stages while being roused to resist the winner's bid but couldn't contain that rival. SMART SPENDING was rated
off the second flight along the inside in the opening half, shifted out splitting rivals racing through the far turn, angled back to the inside racing into upper
stretch to bid inside the top pair but finished evenly late. MAP EM UP exchanged bumps with CHARGE IT JENN at the start, was reserved along the inside
racing to the backstretch, switched out leaving the far turn and continued with an effort to gain some position between foes. FALL MOON settled last racing
to the backstretch, steadied avoiding tight quarters along the inside midway through the far turn, then swung five wide racing into the stretch to gain some
position with a belated effort. CHARGE IT JENN exchanged bumps at the start, settled between foes, switched out on the backstretch to make some brief
