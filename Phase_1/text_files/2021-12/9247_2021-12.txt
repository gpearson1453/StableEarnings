LADY FROSTED stumbled at the start, racing in the rear, moved up down the backside, took command around the final turn, pulled away and won handily,
being much the best. SWEET PRAYERS went to the front, drove clear, proved no match for the winner, but held on for second. WHIPUM NAENAE pressed
the pace, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished for second. FLURRY OF FEATHERS raced near the back, finished evenly and was never a
factor. SUSAN STRONG void of early speed and showed little. ERIN'S CREATION was an early factor, dropped back and was outrun.

STARBUCK LUCK vied for the early advantage, drove clear around the turn and was kept to the task. PUZZLING PRIORITY unhurried in the beginning,
moved up on the outside around the turn, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. FINNLEYS ENCORE void of early
speed, came around the turn seven wide, made a wide rally and got up for third. A. K. A. GRAMS raced within contention, weakened and got caught for the
show. GIRL IN BLACK raced evenly near the back, came around the turn wide and was no factor. SARAH ADRIANA raced within striking distance, came
around the turn on the outside and faded. SUMMERTIME BANDIT pressed the early pace, saved ground around the turn and retreated. SHE WANTS HALF

Footnotes
RATHER PRECOCIOUS broke out, vied for the early lead, drove clear, was all out and held on for the win. TAP ATTACK raced in the middle of the field,
made a late bid and was outfinished. CLERIC raced near the middle of the pack, made a late bid, was outfinished, while putting forth a game effort. FLYING
BANKROLL broke out, void of early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. OXXON lacked early speed, improved position, while racing on the rail,
but was no factor. FIFTY PROTECTION raced near the back, came around the turn wide and was never a threat. JUST RIGHT MIKE bumped at the start,
dueled for the early advantage and faded. LUCKY BREAK pressed the early pace, saved ground around the turn and dropped back. SIGN OF WAR raced
within striking distance, came around the turn wide and was outrun.

Footnotes

PROSPECTOR hopped at the start, racing in the back, made a steady gain and finished willingly. HIGH PRIORITY challenged for the early advantage,
forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late kick. CYBER GUN lacked early speed, showed late interest, while finishing wide, but was no factor. MAJOR
FREAK raced near the back in the beginning, improved position, but was no threat. LULLABY BANDIT showed early speed and faded. TENPINS
TERRITORY raced evenly near the back, saved ground around the final turn, waited, being blocked and was never a threat. HE'S A CLASSIC pressed the
early pace, had a wide trip and dropped back. MINISTER MICKEY pressed the early pace and retreated. RHETTROACTIVE raced near the back and
showed little.
