MCGRAW away alertly, set all the pace, drifted out a bit when struck with a left handed whip near the furlong maker, and widened under right handed urging
to win as much the best. DEXQUIRE chased the winner was no match while second best. STUNT MAN stalked the pace and went evenly. RACIN' JACIN
had a mild late rally three wide. ROLLIN SO PERFECT failed to menace. YOU'RE OUT settled mid pack then lacked the needed response. GONE IN A
FLASH saved ground while close up into the stretch then faded. TAMMY'S TOY was no factor. GRACE SILENT WISH was outrun. OHIO STRONG showed
little. OLIVER'S ODDS had speed into the turn the stopped.

LUCKY QUARTERS sprinted to the lead shortly after the start, set all the pace and drew off late under confident handling. ULTRA RAYS never far back,
advanced along the rail on the turn then was no match for the winner while clear for second. CACKI passed tiring rivals four wide through the stretch. MY
SWEET KAT pressured the winner three wide into the stretch then faded. HAPPY AS YOU GO broke a step slow, saved ground and was no threat. MISS
OVER THERE pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then gave way. HELLS BELLS HELEN had speed through the turn then flattened out.

Footnotes
LITTLE BLAKER steadied inside the leader as that one drifted in nearing the nine sixteenths pole, shifted outside that one, kept pressure into the stretch,
dug in gamey past the furlong maker and proved best under mild urging. BISCUITS AND GRITS broke in front, drifted inward while setting a pressured
pace, maintained a narrow advantage until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. OAKEN stalked the pace and finished determinedly in the four
path. CLASSIC MO steadied along the rail nearing the five eighths pole, remained a forward factor into the stretch and faded late. OVER ICCE close up,
failed to respond. MISTER MOBIL was through after a half.
