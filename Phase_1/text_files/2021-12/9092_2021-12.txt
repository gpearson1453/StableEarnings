Footnotes
AFTER THE CANDY set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear lead with a quarter to run and drew off as handy winner. BLAME THE DEVIL was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. PRETTY
LOUD lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. ATTORNEY LOUIS pressed the pace while racing three-wide and
gave way through the final furlong. AWEZEE was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and did not menace. FROG WALKER was forwardly
placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. LEA COSTA ME broke out, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn and did
not offer a bid.

Footnotes
FINISHED MY P H D sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, remained in control the final furlong and held TOTHEMOONANDBACK
safe late. TOTHEMOONANDBACK broke sharply to race closest to the winner throughout, raced three-wide through the turn and was gaining on the winner
late. FOXY CARMELA settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to gain late. TWIRLY GIRL lacked early foot, raced
four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. SIZZLING GRACE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace.
MONGOLIAN EMPIRE raced off the pacesetters throughout and lacked the needed rally. KERRALIA was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the
turn and gradually weakened. THE CHICAGO WAY lagged throughout.

settled off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn and finished with good late energy. FOGGIA sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting
the pace and gave way late. SINGLE LADY raced off the pacesetters early, angled in with a furlong to run and finished evenly late. TIME FOR GOLD was
void of early speed, saved ground while setting the pace and was not a factor. CHAMPION RISK chased the leaders from the inside and weakened after
going a half. QUATRO chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after a half. ASHLEY'S NEW SHOES showed no early speed, raced
three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. THETRAILERGUY lacked early speed, raced five-wide through turn and
failed to gain late. A NEW TREND was forwardly placed early, ,moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. TEN CARAT
ROCK settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and failed to rally. INTIMIDATING was void of early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did
not threaten. VIX HERO was never far back, raced three-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. ROCKET POWER was forwardly placed early,
moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. LINEMANS CHECK showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
