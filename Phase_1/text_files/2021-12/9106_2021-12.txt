Footnotes
HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE was well placed on the inside, angled out three wide in the stretch, prevailed after a long stretch battle. STATUS SYMBOL dueled on
the lead throughout, held gamely in the stretch and just missed. SOLE FACTOR tracked three wide, rallied in the stretch and closed willingly. NATURAL
BLING was allowed to settle early, improved late while no threat. NORTHERN JOURNEY well placed and saved ground, went evenly late. OFFLEE SILKIE
dueled early and weakened in the stretch. HEIDI'S BACK dueled on the lead and was through after a half. LOVELY LADY LINDA was bumped at the start
and was outrun.
