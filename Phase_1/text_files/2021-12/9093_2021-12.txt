Footnotes
MS BUCKSNORT set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, met the bid of SHADOW JUMPER, dueled briefly with that rival and edged
clear for the win. SHADOW JUMPER tracked the early pace, loomed five wide into the turn, made a bid on the winner, dueled briefly, couldn't sustain the
bid and finished second best. SWEET REGARDS was allowed to settle early, raced six wide into the turn and flattened out. SANDPLUM CREEK was
unhurried early, raced four wide into the turn and offered no late rally. DESERT BEAUTY was void of any early speed, raced seven wide into the turn and
never fired. CORNERSTONE was outrun early from the inside and was no factor. YOUNG'UN was up close early, raced between rivals, fell and walked off.

Footnotes
OAKES CROSSING set a pressured early pace, went four wide into the turn, opened up and held for the win. IMA SAINT TOO was reserved early,
advanced seven wide into the turn, was gaining late and finished second best. JEWEL OF NAVARONE was up close early, raced between rivals and
finished evenly. ZESTY JAZZMAN tracked the early pace, went six wide into the turn and was empty. MR LEVI CANYON was allowed to settle early, went
four wide into the turn, angled in and flattened out. GATLING GOLD was taken back early, went five wide into the turn and offered no rally. MY CRAZY
SISTER chased the early pace from off the rail and tired. MR CHARLIE KING was void of speed and was no factor.
