Footnotes
BEASTFROMTHEEAST pressed the pace on the inside while racing up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear under a
drive in upper stretch and drew off to the wire, much the best. MY MAN VITO chased the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile,
began a bid from the two path approaching the three eighths pole, could not go with the winner in the stretch and chased that rival home, the best of the
rest. MAGIC PRO chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, improved position while saving ground around the turn, chased the frontrunners
down the lane and was no match for the top two. BANDITOFTHEPRAIRIE trailed well behind the field up the backstretch, began to gain ground while racing
in the three path around the turn and continued to pass tiring horses in the stretch. TRINNI SURPRISE raced off the pace on the inside in the early going,
switched to the outside near the half mile, checking slightly in the process, found room to angle back in to save ground around what remained of the turn,
and improved position in late stretch while never threatening the top three. PRAYIN ON CURRENCY led the field on the outside up the backstretch, dueled
from the two path around the turn, gave way approaching the quarter pole and faded further in the stretch, getting caught at the wire for fifth. TORDO was
squeezed back leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the turn and came up empty in the
stretch. BETTINGONADREAM raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path,
swung wide entering the stretch and tired on the outside from there.

Footnotes
SCIENCE FRICTION went up to engage NUMERIC and DOLCE APRILE from outside after a half-mile, took over with little difficulty and pulled clear midway
on the turn, drifted four or five wide into the stretch, and continued to widen under a drive in the middle of the track. MISS BETH'EL shifted out four wide
after six furlongs, switched to her correct lead a sixteenth out, and overtook NUMERIC for second at the wire. NUMERIC set the pace inside to the turn, was
no match for SCIENCE FICTION before completing five furlongs, weakened through the lane and was caught for second. UNBRIDLED CHROME hit the
right side of the gate coming out, trailed for six furlongs, came six wide into the lane and did enough to get the last major share. DOLCE APRILE pressed
NUMERIC from outside early, and was finished midway on the turn. VANISHING FAITH faded steadily after six furlongs.

Footnotes
THELASTBULLETSMINE was bumped at the start, checked near the nine-sixteenths, circled four wide around the turn, swept to the front in upper stretch
and quickly drew off while ridden out. PRINCESS TERESKA tracked the pace from the rail, tipped out in upper stretch, was no match for the winner but
stayed on to be clearly second best. SENORITA SALSA bumped the winner at the start, was in range three wide, lacked a rally but churned on to best the
rest. BONNIE'S THE BEST failed to menace while racing three wide. BORDEAUX LEGACY raced off the pace two wide, swung five wide in upper stretch,
continued on the left lead and never threatened. DRILLZILLA stalked the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane. MAMA LONGLEGS set the pace
along the rail and tired in the lane. ADVANCED TECHNOLOG trailed inside.

Footnotes
KING CAIRO chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path passing the three eighths pole, kicked clear in upper
stretch and held his lead to the wire. METEORITO raced off the pace through the opening half mile, began to improve position while racing in the two and
three path around the turn, and continued to gain ground mildly down the lane. TWO PRINCES raced off the pace up the backstretch, began to gain ground
from the three path around the turn and continued to improve position in the stretch. HARD TEN trailed the field up the backstretch and around the turn,
saved ground, and passed tiring horses in the stretch. THRU THE VINE raced at the back of the pack in the early going, navigated the turn from the two and
three path, swung wide entering the stretch and passed tiring horses to the wire. CONVERTER sprinted to a clear early lead, showed the way up the long
backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn, couldn't go with the winner entering the stretch and weakened further late. ETHOS chased the
leaders on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and flattened out in the stretch. THE RED MAN chased the leader between
horses through the opening quarter of a mile, dropped back to race in the middle of the pack up what remained of the backstretch, began to tire while saving
ground around the turn and faded further from there.

Footnotes
TANG was under a drive advancing three wide on the far turn, battled outside EUPHORIA STAR through the drive and proved best late. EUPHORIA STAR
was strung out four wide on the first turn, moved outside FLATBUSH and TEMPESTUOUS as they all went up to overhaul NEGLIGENCE midway up the
backstretch, forged to a clear lead in upper stretch, could not handle TANG to the wire but was clearly second best. CUPID'S DUDE bumped with ARIES
REIGNS at the start, lagged in the second flight for six furlongs, came three wide into the lane and rallied to go clear of the remainder. DAKOTA BOY trailed
early inside, picked off rivals rapidly four wide approaching the far turn, loomed outside the leaders with a quarter-mile to run, then flattened out into the
stretch. FLATBUSH put in an early move to wrest the lead from NEGLIGENCE after a half-mile, battled inside TEMPESTUOUS and EUPHORIA STAR into
the far turn, and gave way after six furlongs. TEMPESTUOUS went up between FLATBUSH and EUPHORIA STAR midway up the backstretch, and tired
before reaching the stretch. ARIES REIGNS bumped with CUPID'S DUDE at the start, raced under a firm hold in heavy traffic approaching and around the
first turn, and was empty when roused. UNTWISTED was outrun three to four wide throughout. NEGLIGENCE sped off early inside, got overrun by a trio of
challengers before going a half, and retreated.

Footnotes
LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN settled off the pace inside, made progress rounding the far turn, split rivals nearing the eighth pole, took over leaving that marker and
edged ahead while ridden out. YOLANDA'S PRIDE set a rated pace along the rail, led to midstretch and dug in to hold the place. CAUSINGAHULLBALOO
stalked the pace two wide in the clear, bid nearing the eighth pole but was outfinished. SOUPER ALL STAR saved ground in range, angled three wide near
the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. BRODY'S HONOR was wrangled back inside, trailed to upper stretch, made good progress inside of foes in
upper stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. LADY JAE raced off the early pace two wide, went four wide around the far turn and never threatened.
DOUBLE BLESSED failed to menace while racing two and three wide. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
YES I'M A BEAST was urged to an early lead between horses, showed the way on the inside up what remained of the backstretch, saved ground around
the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and was in command down the lane. RUSSIAN TO WIN chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch,
raced in the three path around turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground on the outside down the stretch, the best of the rest.
ORIENTAL PARK trailed the field up the backstretch, began to improve position while saving ground around the turn, and continued to gain ground while
drifting out in the stretch. GILLIGAN pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, chased the leader from the two path around the turn, weakened in
the final furlong and drifted out late. LUNI SIMA raced off the pace in the early going, moved up while racing in the four path around the turn, and flattened
out in the lane. PO BOY raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path, swung wider still entering the stretch and
came up empty from there.

Footnotes
PRETTY RACHEL prompted the early pace outside PIPER, took over midway on the turn, came into the lane well off the rail, and stayed clear under
pressure. RAIN tracked the leaders alone in third on the turn, moved into second but could not make an impression on PRETTY RACHEL approaching the
stretch, outdueled ALIZEE through the late stages and just saved the place. BEAUTY QUEEN broke awkwardly spotting the field a couple lengths, lagged at
the back for a half-mile, came five wide off the turn and was going well too late. ALIZEE raced in the second flight early inside, rallied in the three-path inside
rivals turning for home, got outdueled inside RAIN for second in deep stretch, then was nailed for the show at the wire. YES I'M EVIL settled in midpack for
a half, shifted five wide at the top of the stretch, and lacked the needed response. READY ORB NOT never menaced through an even effort two wide.
PIPER sped clear early, was no match for PRETTY RACHEL midway on the turn, and folded up soon after that.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA FROLIC stalked the pace inside, came through inside of the pacesetter nearing the lane, took over in upper stretch, vied inside past the eighth
pole and drove clear. CHURCHTOWN set the pace along the rail around the first turn, eased into the two path early on the backstretch, remained off the rail
around the far turn, was collared by the winner in upper stretch, fought on outside of that foe but was no match late while holding well clear of the rest.
KITODAN prompted the pace two wide, dropped back between foes around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and was along for the show. HEY
PORTER failed to menace while racing three wide. JUST CALL RAY stalked the pace three wide and faded through the lane. C MY MEISTER saved
ground off the pace made some progress in upper stretch but weakened in the final sixteenth. LAMENT raced two wide between foes in midpack, steadied
near the five-sixteenths pole and lacked a rally. JUST SO YA KNOW played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
ABAAN broke sharply and led the field under a hold through the opening mile, saved ground throughout, turned back a challenger three furlongs from the
wire, opened up passing the quarter pole and drew off while drifting out in the final furlong. AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM chased the leader while saving
ground the first time around the oval, moved up to challenge on the outside racing up the backstretch for the second time, pressed the pace from the two
path around the fourth turn, could not go with the winner in the stretch and chased that rival home, second best. FANTASIOSO (ARG) raced in the three
and four path around the first turn, angled in to run in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch and around the second bend, moved up from
the two path racing up the backstretch for the second time and was outkicked down the lane while finishing evenly. JARREAU raced in the two path around
the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace between horses, switched to run outside around the second turn and the first time down the stretch,
continued in the two path from there, improved position racing around the far turn and finished evenly but was no match for the top finishers. BLUEGRASS
PARKWAY raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, angled in to race between horses in the two path around the second turn,
continued to race outside in the middle of the pack through the next half mile, improved position mildly while saving ground around the far turn and was
outkicked in the stretch. MALTHAEL saved ground throughout, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside for the opening mile and a half of the race and
weakened from the rail in the final furlong. NIXON JOY (ARG) raced off the pace in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, angled in to
save ground and race inside through the next half mile, began to drop back while racing up the backstretch for the second time and continued to tire from
there. CHEYENNE'S COLONEL raced in the three path around the first turn, angled in to save ground entering the backstretch and remained on the rail for
the rest of the race, trailed the field throughout, did not appear in distress while being pulled up and was vanned off. RUN UP AND FRACTIONAL TIMES
UNAVAILABLE. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
