Footnotes
LA CROIX vied inside of two rivals on the backstretch, drifted out and bumped rival early on the turn, entered stretch clear, and lugged in upper stretch and
impeded A DIME FOR ME, kept to task late to hold safely. A DIME FOR ME chased trio along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on
the turn and advanced to be right behind the leader heading into the stretch, had a slim hole to try and go thru at the top of the lane but LA CROIX lugged in
and caused A DIME FOR ME to steady, regathered momentum in the final sixteenth and came back on late. MY SIS CINDY vied between rivals on the
backstretch for the lead, continued pressing the pace on the turn, bumped by LA CROIX early on the turn, in range entering the stretch and stayed on to
hold show. BIG AWARD hopped and came away slow, chased leaders in between on the backstretch, continued in between in on the turn, launched mild
bid along the inside in the stretch while make minor progress. EXPENSIVE DEVON pressed pace three wide on the backstretch, continued contesting pace
three wide on the turn and faded in upper stretch. MY TIGRESS off slow, stalked pace along the inside on the backstretch, continued to save ground on the
turn, entered stretch along the inside, and seemed to have some run, but a combination of traffic and not enough response, rider chose to basically wrap up
and coasted to the wire. AT THE MARGIN chased trio of leaders three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the
stretch and flattened out in upper stretch. STEWARDS INQUIRY, AFTER REVIEW, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFED LA CROIX AND PLACED HER
BEHIND A DIME FOR ME FOR INTERFERRENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH
