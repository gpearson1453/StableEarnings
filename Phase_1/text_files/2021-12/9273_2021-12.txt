Footnotes
VERSTAPPEN tracked two wide, stalked behind the leading trio from between horses around the far turn, tipped four wide at the quarter pole while bumping
an outer FREEDOM'S WAY in the process, then rallied to bid for the lead in upper stretch, cleared at the furlong grounds, and held sway safely on his left
lead. FREEDOM'S WAY settled off of the pace two wide, gained between horses turning for home while shifting to the four path, but was bumped five wide
at the quarter pole by an inner VERSTAPPEN, got outkicked passing that marker, then chased that foe home well while outside of HESTON, and prevailed
over that foe for place. HESTON rated far off of the pace along the inside, tracked from behind traffic the two to three path turning for home, tipped four wide
in upper stretch, then chased the clear leader through the final furlong while inside of FREEDOM'S WAY, but was bested for place. MAZUMA stalked along
the inside, moved inside of the leader at the half mile pole, vied around the far turn while staying in the two path, briefly cleared passing the quarter pole, but
was bested approaching the final furlong, and weakened. IBERVILLE stalked two to three wide, pressed the leading pair from the four path around the far
turn, bid entering the lane, but was outkicked in upper stretch, and faltered. OVERANALYTICAL saved ground in midpack, stalked from the pocket around
the far turn, but faded through the lane. FAITH RUNNER tracked three wide, but faded while getting floated six wide turning for home. MARQUEE RIDE
broke a half step slowly, and never got involved. PATH TO SUCCESS lacked speed in the four to three path around the first turn, and failed to factor.
MASQUERADE BALL set the pace while staying off of the rail, met an inner foe's bid at the half mile pole while in the three path, and weakened entering the
lane. CURLIN EDGES got outrun.

GRAVY HOUND set the pace inside of a vying BIG BELLA BROWN while staying a bit off of the rail around the turn, shook clear of that rival passing the
quarter pole, inched further away through midstretch, and held sway safely. BOOTSIE'S GALAXY broke a step slowly, gained from far off of the pace three
wide around the turn, tipped four wide entering the lane, and sustained her charge to reach place approaching the final sixteenth. RELEASE THE BEAST
failed to keep pace along the inside into the turn, shifted two wide entering the lane, then improved among foes while tipping four to five wide in the in the
final furlong. WAR COUNT tracked three wide, and chased evenly. NO PEDIGREE chased along the inside while in the two path around the turn, but failed
to produce a bid. LIKE MIKE was void of early speed two to three wide around the turn, got floated five wide in midstretch, and failed to factor. BIG BELLA
BROWN vied two wide, but failed to keep pace with her inner counterpart passing the quarter pole, and weakened between horses in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
GENTLE SOUL tracked from midpack along the inside, rated two wide and between horses around the far turn, chased while improving behind the leading
trio through upper stretch, tipped outside of them passing the furlong grounds, and produced a good kick to drive past those rivals in the final sixteenth.
BLUE LOU BOYLE (IRE) stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leading pair in upper stretch, ranged up at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked
by an outer rival in the final sixteenth while sparring with inner foes, and prevailed for place. TAKAFUMI (BRZ) stalked two wide, prompted between the
leaders around the far turn, bid at the quarter pole sparking a duel with EL SOCIO, battled through midstretch as an outer foe ranged up, then got bested by
that rival for place. EL SOCIO pulled keenly to a clear advantage into the far turn while staying in the two path, vied inside of an early bidder down the
backstretch, shook off that rival while meeting TAKAFUMI (BRZ)'s bid at the quarter pole, battled gamely through midstretch, but yielded late. AMERICAN
DIAMOND settled far off of the pace along the inside, then two to three wide around the far turn, split foes three wide passing the three sixteenth, and move
dup on his left lead. CALL ME PLUCKY saved ground off of the pace, but failed to threaten. WIN WORTHY broke slowly and raced at the rear, gained three
to five wide turning for home, and improved in upper stretch before leveling off. NEW YEAR SURPRISE tracked from midpack four wide, moved early into
the backstretch to bid at the five furlong pole, led outside of a pair of foes into the far turn, but weakened while drifting outwardly entering the lane. COUSIN
LARRY gained mildly four wide from far off of the pace around the far turn, but flattened out in upper stretch. READY TO ROLL bobbled slightly at the start,
tracked three to four wide, but faded around the far turn. CHANGI tracked two wide, then three wide and between horses around the far turn, but lacked a
rally. U S NAVY CROSS got outrun. THE SIX FURLONG FRACTION WAS OMITTED AND IS PENDING REVIEW. THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION
WAS HAND-TIMED.

REAGAN'S DECISION laid close up along the inside, stalked while pocketed around the turn, got outmoved by an outer HAZY COMMAND entering the
lane, shifted to the four path to take aim on that foe from the outside, rallied to bid in the final sixteenth, and got up approaching the wire. HAZY COMMAND
tracked the pace, gained four wide around the turn to bid for the lead outside of MAKE OUT entering the lane, inched clear of that foe at the furlong grounds
as REAGAN'S DECISION pursued, met that foe's bid in the final sixteenth, and got nailed. MAKE OUT set the pace while in the two path around the turn,
resisted HAZY COMMAND's bid entering the lane, but gave way at the furlong grounds. ELLE OF THE BALL had her head turned to the inside when the
gates opened and came out slowly, closed the gap on the main group into the turn, split rivals while shifting three to four wide, but flattened out in upper
stretch. OMKARA was outrun early on, but showed late interest along the rail. GEORGETOWN ROAD stalked two wide and between horses, but tired at the
quarter pole. VERY WEALTHY pressed the pace three wide, but weakened between horses entering the lane. BEYOND PERFECTION showed brief
speed, chased for a quarter mile, then folded up.

SUMMER IN SARATOGA broke well but was allowed to settle, laid at the rear two to three wide, shifted five wide entering the lane, rallied outside of foes,
reeled in the clear tiring leader in the final sixteenth along with an inner BELLAGAMBA (ARG), dueled with that foe to the wire, and prevailed.
BELLAGAMBA (ARG) tracked two wide, shifted four wide entering the lane, rallied inside along with an outer SUMMER IN SARATOAG to bid inside the
final sixteenth, but was outfinished by that foe late. CATCH A BID stalked two wide, pressed before vying around the far turn, cleared off in upper stretch,
but tired entering the final furlong as outer foes closed in, and was caught by a pair of them inside the final sixteenth. MORE THAN UNUSUAL saved ground
off of the pace, chased two wide through upper stretch, but failed to threaten late. CURLY RUTH stalked comfortably behind the leading pair into the far
turn, shifted outside of them at the quarter pole, but lacked a rally. ADVOCATING set the pace inside of a pressing rival, got headed at the quarter pole, and
weakened.

Footnotes
ST ANDREWS was hustled along early on to vie for the lead inside of PLANTERS PUNCH, gamely dueled with that rival through the lane, and stubbornly
held to the wire. PLANTERS PUNCH vied for the lead outside of ST ANDREWS, determinedly sustained a race-long battle through the lane, but was
outgamed. BOSS' DIALIN IN advanced to an inside position while off of the pace, came under strong restraint to keep course into the turn, saved ground
before shifting three wide entering the lane, chased while drifting out entering the final furlong, then produced a late kick to close the gap on the leaders late.
DOWNTOWN CONNECTOR stalked along the inside, tipped to the two path while still behind the leading pair turning for home, then only managed to
chase through the lane and failed to bid. SMARTY JOHN broke slowly and trailed the field into the turn, improved turning for home and upper stretch, then
shifted to the five path in midstretch and stayed on. KEEN HEIR failed to keep pace early on, and played no factor. SETSTONE got caught four to five wide
around the turn while off of the pace, and tired. HADDASSAH'S DEVIL was outrun along the inside. LEGIONNAIRE chased three to two wide, around the
turn but weakened when floated four wide at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
JUST MIGHT dueled for the lead through a hard pressed pace inside of FIELD DAY, easily disposed of that foe at the five sixteenths pole, drew clear while
well in hand through upper stretch, then was set down at the furlong grounds as foes inched closer, but safely held sway to the wire. MANNY WAH stalked
two wide, gained three wide turning for home to vie for place behind the clear leader entering the land, forged that position in upper stretch, shifted inwardly
while hanging on his left lead as PYRON bid for place in the late stages, and just held. PYRON saved ground far off of the pace, then stayed on along the
rail through the final furlong to bid for place, but failed to reach an outer foe for that position. MR. HUSTLE stalked along the inside shifted outside of the
clear leader in upper stretch, but failed to progress on his margin before tiring in the final sixteenth. LUCKY CURLIN lagged behind the field around the turn,
picked up stride while shifting to the three path entering the lane, and improved in the five path late. GRINNING TIGER laid off of the pace in the three to
four path around the turn, and failed to factor. FIELD DAY dueled outside of the eventual winner through an arduous pace, but weakened approaching the
five sixteenths pole.

CHESS CHIEF stalked two wide and between horses while taking the first turn in the three path, failed to keep pace with an inner bidding MAJOR FED
when getting floated four wide by that rival entering the lane, but sustained chasing position through upper stretch, maintained stride under a long drive to
reel in the tiring leader and bid along with an inner HAPPY AMERICAN a sixteenth out, and prevailed over that rival in a tight photo finish. HAPPY
AMERICAN bobbled slightly at the start, but lagged well behind the field around the first turn, picked up stride turning for home, cut the gap on the leaders
through upper stretch, split those rivals two wide at the furlong grounds, bid along with an outer CHESS CHIEF passing the sixteenth pole, but was
outfinished. PIRATE'S PUNCH set a pressured pace, showed the way from a vying EBBEN around the far turn, shook clear passing the quarter pole, held
sway while tiring entering the final furlong, but was caught by an outer pair of rivals passing the sixteenth pole. SHARED SENSE settled off of the pace two
wide and between horses, took back mildly from tight quarters among foes into the backstretch, gained turning for home while being floated four to six wide,
but flattened out in midstretch. MAJOR FED required a shoe-repair pre-race, tracked along the inside, improved to a stalking position around the first turn,
tipped outside of the leading pair entering the lane to bid in upper stretch, but flattened out at the furlong grounds while chasing a clear PIRATE'S PUNCH,
and faltered. EBBEN shifted out around the first turn to press the pace two wide, vied around the far turn, but yielded between horses entering the lane, and
weakened. WARRIOR IN CHIEF pressed the pace from the four to three path around the first turn, stalked down the backstretch, but weakened while
getting floated five wide turning for home. LITTLE MENACE laid off of the pace three to four wide, but faded turning for home, and was eased through the
lane.

Footnotes
HALO AGAIN set the pace along the inside of a vying FORTY UNDER, shifted outwardly in upper stretch before shaking clear of that foe passing the three
sixteenths pole, and gamely lasted from a pair of bidding foes late. PIXELATE settled off of the pace three wide, gained three to four wide around the far
turn, rallied inside of MONARCHS GLEN (GB) while hanging in his left lead to bid for place between horses a sixteenth out, and prevailed while running out
of ground to catch the leader. MONARCHS GLEN (GB) rated at the rear along the inside, tracked in the four path while awaiting racing room turning for
home, tipped five wide and outside of PIXELATE entering the lane, rallied along with that foe to bid for place at the sixteenth pole, but missed that position
to that rival. FORTY UNDER vied for the lead outside of HALO AGAIN, shifted a path out to create separation entering the lane, but was herded further out
when that rival drifted inside the three sixteenths pole, then failed to keep pace entering the final furlong, and faltered to a pair of outer rivals in the final
sixteenth. BIG DREAMING bumped an outer foe at the start, stalked along the inside, shifted two wide entering the lane, but only managed to chase, and
lacked a bid. LOGICAL MYTH saved ground off of the pace, rallied along the rail through upper stretch to attempt a place bid approaching the final
sixteenth, but leveled off. MIDNIGHT TEA TIME stalked three wide, but tired entering the final furlong. ANOTHER MYSTERY was pinched back between
horses at the start, laid at the rear two wide, then five wide around the far turn before fading. ARTIE'S RUMOR bumped an inner foe at the start, stalked two
wide and between horses, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
NORTH COUNTY stalked two to three wide, shifted to the four path entering the lane to be outside of a clearing FANNIE AND FREDDIE, but rallied through
midstretch with determined strides to reel that rival in inside the final sixteenth, and forged an advantage approaching the wire. FANNIE AND FREDDIE vied
along the inside early on before allowing an outer rival to clear into the first turn, smoothly shifted to the three path to be outside of that foe entering the
backstretch, intently tracked around the far turn before ranging up in hand entering the lane, then shook clear after responding to rousing pressure at the
three sixteenths pole, dug in inside the final furlong as NORTH COUNTY menaced, but was bested in the closing stages. COCKTAIL MOMENTS broke
flatfootedly and was void of early speed, settled two wide advanced between horses entering the lane, chased from behind the leading pair while
considering a rail rally in upper stretch, decidedly altered to the three path at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer rival in the process, then
kept on while hanging on her left lead. SHOTGUN HOTTIE set the pace two wide, tugged clear into the first turn, showed the way from a stalking FANNIE
AND FREDDIE while staying in the two path around the far turn, but was headed by that foe in upper stretch, and gave way. FEELING HAPPY trailed in the
three path around the first turn, took the far turn four wide, and failed to factor. CALIFORNIA ANGEL tracked along the inside while keen around the first
turn, settled into stalking position down the backstretch, but faded at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
EPICENTER pressed the pace two wide, vied down the backstretch, assumed command while in hand passing the quarter pole, drew clear shortly after,
and was ridden out under mild hand urging through the final furlong. TEJANO TWIST settled far off of the pace along the inside, improved to a tracking
position into the far turn, sustained an advance while tipping outside of the leading pair entering the lane, gained place in upper stretch as EPICENTER took
over, and was second best while not threatening that one late. SURFER DUDE set the pace inside of a vying EPICENTER, but proved no match for that foe
passing the quarter pole, gave way in midstretch, but just saved show from an inner foe late. KEVIN'S FOLLY laid far off of the pace two wide, came under
stern urging to keep pace into the far turn, but sustained stride, through midstretch to attempt a bid for show inside of SURFER DUDE, but flattened out.
RICH STRIKE raced at the rear in the three path around the first turn, then saved ground around the far turn, but to no avail. ROCKET DAWG raced
forwardly placed while keen to place, rankly fought restraint through the first turn, remained unsettled after being perched outside of the leading pair in the
early part of the backstretch, but briefly settled into stride into the far turn before fading with three furlongs remaining. WAITA MINUTE HAYES tracked two
wide, but faltered outside of a pair of foes at the half mile pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
GILDED RULER prompted the pace three to two wide, but was roused to keep pace with the leader into the turn, sustained chasing position turning for
home, ranged up to that foe at the three sixteenths pole, forged an advantage a sixteenth from home, and edged away. PEACEFUL WATERS set the pace,
inched clear of a prompting foe into the turn, but awkwardly changed leads at the three sixteenths pole as that foe menaced, resisted that rival's bid through
midstretch, but was bested at the sixteenth pole. MIDNIGHT HURRICANE broke a bit inwardly, tracked three wide, ranged up outside of the leading pair
turning for home, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, toiled at the furlong grounds, then saved show. INEXORABLE tracked from midpack two wide and
between horses, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and stayed on, but missed reaching show. TIZ OF THEE broke a step slowly before getting pinched back
between horses at the start, gained three to four wide turning for home, but flattened out while getting floated five wide in midstretch. BALTIC FLEET broke
outwardly, laid off of the pace along the inside, swung six wide entering the lane but failed to factor. SERGEANT RECKLESS was forced by an inner foe into
an outer rival at the start, swung five wide entering the lane while well off of the pace, and made little impact. DEL MOON stumbled at the start, trailed
around the turn, and never got involved. CHARLEMAGNE broke inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, pressed between horses before stalking from the
inside, but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
CYBERKNIFE bobbled a bit at the start, then stalked three wide, bid into the far turn, cleared at the quarter pole, but tired late as JEEPER re-bid, but lasted
to the wire. JEEPER set the pace along the inside, got headed by CYBERKNIFE turning for home, failed to keep pace passing the quarter pole, but altered
course outside of that rival while sustaining his chase, came again in the final furlong as that foe tired, but missed. JEGO stalked along the inside, shifted
three wide entering the lane, and chased the top pair home. ART HEIST pressed the pace two wide, but was outmoved by an outer foe at the three furlong
pole, then faded after being floated four wide in upper stretch. STAVANGER made little impact. MONOLOGUE laid off of the pace three to four wide, and
failed to factor. MAGAZINE STREET stumbled at the start, then saved ground off of the pace, but on little avail. MASK PATROL tracked four wide, but faded
turning for home. DANNY'S LIL DANA broke slowly before bumping with rivals on either side at the start, then got outrun.
