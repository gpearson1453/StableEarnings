BREATHING FIRE raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn, rallied, led mid stretch and held under a drive. SILENT GHOST sprinted clear, set
a reserved pace, was joined late turn and quickly headed, regained command a furlong out but was passed a 16th out. FOREST B steadied at the start,
stalked the pace, bid three-wide late turn, led at the top of the stretch but was headed a furlong out and chased to the end. INSPECTOR RELOAD was
away slowly and settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch then rallied mildly between foes.
DREAMINOFPASSION raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn then finished evenly along the fence. PEGGY BANK stalked the pace,
dropped back on the turn then also mustered a mild late response. FUN COOL was pinched back early and settled off the pace, was hustled four-wide on
the turn but never reached contention.

Footnotes
HENRY'S GAMBLE, off the pace, had one rival beat into the turn, circled the field two to four wide and came out to the ten path turning for home under left
handed encouragement, closed down the lane while drifting in and led at the seventy yard pole, pulling away late. AT THE LYRIC began awkwardly but
regrouped to sit outside three others for the early lead, cleared off after a sixteenth and repulsed a few challengers, held to the seventy yard pole when the
winner went by, clearly second best. DREAMS AND SCHEMES chased along the inside, in behind the leader turning for home and stayed on to hold the
show. MOON POOL was devoid of early speed from the one hole and trailed the field on the turn, came two to three wide at the quarter pole and angled out
to the seven path in upper stretch, closing late outside to grab a minor award. ROOKIE COURT brushed the side of the gate at the start and settled along
the rail in midpack, rallied into the fourth position mildly down the lane but was outkicked for that spot late. MISS THE HYPE was three wide inside the
eventual place finisher for the early lead, stalked that rival and bid inside the quarter pole but was out of gas and faded in the final furlong. TERRIFIC LADY
chased outside the early leaders, three wide to loom inside the quarter pole but faded in the final furlong. FLASHY GET EVEN off the pace early, circled the
field four wide on the turn and out in the six path turning for home but the rally stalled in the final eighth. SILENT CREEK vied inside three rivals for the early
lead, took back to chase those rivals who went on with it, then retreated midway on the turn and down the lane. MOHAYMEN DAY sat in midpack, was
between rivals two to three wide on the turn but had no run from upper stretch to the wire.
