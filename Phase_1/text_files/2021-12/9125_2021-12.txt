LUKES SECRET went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and was kept to the task. VELVET NIGHT unhurried in the beginning, moved up around the
final turn, split rivals down the stretch and finished willingly. PRICEY raced near the back in the early part, moved up, within contention, came around the
second turn on the outside and proved no match for the top two. TALE OF TENSAS pressed the pace, saved ground around the second turn and was
outfinished for show. HOLY WAR was an early factor, weakened and finished evenly. SANDY'S WAGER void of early speed, was never close and eased to
the wire. DIVIDED pressed the early pace, raced wide around the first turn, dropped back and was eased to the wire.

CPRIORITY unhurried in the early part, moved up on the outside around the final turn, dueled down the lane and proved the best late. JUSTA BUSTER vied
for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the home stretch, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. SILVER CHALICE
challenged for the early advantage, raced outside around the final turn and proved no match for the top two. BLUE SKY FLASH lacked early speed, came
around the second turn wide, showed late interest, but was no factor. SPEEDOFTHESPEED raced near the middle of the field, put forth an even effort and
lacked a rally. PRODUCTION TIME void of early speed and was never a threat. CHARLIE'S TOWN flashed early speed and made a steady retreat.
ETBAUER'S SECRET raced within striking distance and dropped back. FRANK LEROY raced near the back, pulled up down the backside and was
euthanized.

NOSBOR raced in the middle of the field, moved up around the turn, split rivals, angled inside and got up in time. JONATHAN WHO hesitated at the start,
racing from the rear, moved up on the outside around the turn and was outfinished at the wire. HOMELAND MESSA lacked early speed, made a late wide
gain and finished willingly. SAPONI raced within striking distance, made a bid, took the lead at the head of the stretch, then hung and lacked a finish. THE
FLUSH KING raced in the back of the pack and passed tired ones. HARRY'S LIL HIPPIE void of early speed and showed little. ROCKIN ROG dueled on the
front end in the beginning and faded. DESIARD vied for the early advantage, saved ground around the turn and dropped back. MARVELOUS RED raced
within contention, saved ground around the turn, faded and trailed late.

BIG IF TRUE sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout, pulled away down the home stretch and proved much the best. ROMANTIC BEAST pressed
the pace, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but got up for place. CARONDELET raced within contention, had an outside trip,
made a bid, was outfinished for second and just got up for third. SAINT KENNEDY lacked early speed, raced outside around both turns, made a bid and
outfinished for place and show. GOLDEN SMILES raced evenly near the back, finished wide and was never a factor. DA DUE RUN RUN raced within
striking distance and faded. MOLLY GOLIGHTLY void of early speed and showed little.

faded and was no threat late. SPEAKTOMEOFLOVE dueled for the early lead and was finished early. FORT KNOX raced within striking distance in the
