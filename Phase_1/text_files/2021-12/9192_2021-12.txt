Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS DEVIL sprinted to the front, led throughout, drove clear and won under steady urging. CHIEF CHARLIE lacked early speed, made a steady
gain, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. SAMURAI ISLAND raced near the back, saved ground around the final turn, made a bid and
was a clear third at the wire. THE HEAT IS ON pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and weakened down the home stretch. CATALINA LATRINA
broke in, raced within contention, faded and finished evenly. COURTOFGULCH raced evenly near the back and was never close. UNSOLVED broke out,
raced near the middle of the field, came around the first turn on the outside and showed little. CORN SOUP was an early factor and dropped back.

for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, couldn't keep up with the winner late, but was best of others. SHE'S MY PRIORITY raced near the
back in the beginning, came around the turn on the outside, made a mild bid and got up for third. NOON'S BABYGIRL bumped both sides at the start, racing
from the rear, improved position, but was no factor. GRACESSPECIALTOUCH broke in, challenged for the lead, saved ground and faded. MOLLYS FLYIN

ENVOYS LEGACY lacked early speed, trailing the field in the early going, moved up around the turn, entered the stretch four wide, rallied down the lane
and was just up. MY KIKI vied for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, came around the turn three wide, took the lead down the lane, but was

Footnotes
TOWN DRUNK vied for the early lead, dueled throughout and drove clear before the wire. BUCK DYNASTY challenged on the front end, dueled throughout,
proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. MY CALL broke poorly, racing near the back, moved up down the backside, came around the
final turn four wide and was a clear third at the wire. SIR BRONX raced within contention, saved ground around the final turn, made a mild bid on the inside,
but was no real factor. QUALITY PRODUCTION pressed the early pace, raced outside around the first turn and faded. MR MAKEITHAPPEN lacked early
speed, came around the second turn wide and finished evenly near the back. DUTCHMAN broke a step slow and was never close. WITCH DOCTOR raced
within striking distance and dropped back.
