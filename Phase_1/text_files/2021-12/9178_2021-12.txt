Footnotes
TAINO HOUSE was quick to lead setting the pace racing off the rail, went in the two path through the turn, was kept to the task and drew away from.
LAUGHING ROCKETT , who stalked the leader four wide into the turn, moved in three deep on that bend then came in further in upper stretch, was no
match but second best. NOT TODAY SATAN was bumped at the break, raced outside five then four wide on the turn, secured show honors. BULLY RIDE
was fractious in the gate, chased between rivals early, moved in from three to two wide on the turn, weakened. BUMBLEBEE dropped back from between
rivals leaving the backstretch, entered the turn along the inside then moved out three deep midway on that bend, failed to rally. MR CHARLIE KING bumped
a rival at the start, went six wide on the turn drifting out a bit in upper stretch and was not a threat. BESITOS CRIMINALES refused to break and walked off.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
MICHELLE WHO stalked from outside, went five wide on the turn, was given confident handling to drive clear late. OUR SOARING ANGEL pressed the
early pace then continued to stalk four wide through the turn, was outkicked by the aforementioned winner. LATENITE SLEWZY bumped the outer rival at
the start, switched outside rivals entering the turn, moved further to be four wide coming past the quarter pole, angled to the rail at the top of the stretch,
gained late but not enough. QUESTA contested the pace from off the rail, moved clear three wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch. CAUGHT
STEALING settled in behind the leaders off the pace, went four wide on the turn, gained into upper stretch but could not sustain the effort. ALLERGIC TO
LOGIC was mid-pack early, went three wide on the turn, failed to rally. PARADISE N REACH trailed early, went four to six wide on the turn, failed to
threaten. ALL TOO SUPER was bumped at the start, moved out from two to four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. VALLEY VERDE showed brief
speed inside a rival but off the fence, dropped back and faded.
