BETTER YET checked shortly after the break, then switched to the outside and stalked the pace three wide, made a three wide bid mid way on the turn,
shook clear by the furlong marker and then maintained that advantage to prove best under a drive. TEACHER DRAMA was fractious in the gate, then was
unprepared when the gates opened, then settled early on the inside, angled out in the drive and closed well late. MERINO WOOL was well placed on the
inside to the quarter pole, then eased out and made a five wide bid leaving the turn but had no late kick. MIA ANGELINA was rated along three to four wide,
made a four wide bid leaving the quarter pole but flattened out the final furlong. SPECTACULAR NOW set the pace while racing towards the inside and
gave way.

Footnotes
RUSSIAN MELODY dueled for the early lead two to three wide, made a two wide bid to shake clear on the turn, then was given a couple left handed pops in
the furlong grounds with the riding crop to maintain a safe margin. WIRETAP chased the early pace in between rivals, then was still in between rivals
leaving the turn, then finished well towards the inside to be cleaerly second best. STEPH'S PRINCESS stalked the early pace and made a mild bid four wide
leaving the quarter pole but flattened out, bested rest. PETES PRIDE broke inward at the start bumping AMIGOS TUNE, then chased the pace towards the
inside, shifted to the outside on the turn and was five wide by the quarter pole and had no rally. DISCREET SISTER was reserved early and was two wide
by the quarter pole and lacked a rally. AMIGOS TUNE was bumped soundly at the start, then rushed up the inside to duel with the winner and weakened.

MR HOOVER was rated along three wide, then was four wide by the quarter pole while starting to unwind, then came five wide into the drive and closed well
on the outside to get up in time, driving. MIZZEN MONEY set the early pace and was headed nearing the furlong marker, then came again and gained a
short advantage in the furlong grounds but was caught late to just miss. DIABLO D ORO was well placed on the inside, then angled out by the three
sixteenths for racing room, rallied well between rivals but was outkicked. COUNTRY MILES tracked the early pace three wide, made a four wide bid nearing
the quarter pole, gained a short advantage nearing the furlong marker but flattened out. CRAFTY JACK chased the early pace two wide, then was three
wide by the quarter pole, shifted out four wide by the three sixteenths, but had no kick. FIFTY SHEAS OFGREY was dwelt at the start, not a threat.

CHARM ALARM prompted the slow pace and made a three wide bid in hand on the turn, was clear by the quarter pole, then was given four right handed
pops with the riding crop and a few crosses to draw off smartly, then was wrapped up the final seventy yards to prove much the best. PEACEARELLA
tracked the pace from the inside, then eased off the rail leaving the five sixteenths to make a four wide bid by the quarter pole, proved to be no match for the
winner while clearly second best. AMETHYST set a pressured pace on the inside and gave way, held show award. AUTOMATED TELLER tracked the pace
and was three to four wide on the turn, then raced erratic in the drive while coming up empty. MAKE A WISH was reserved early on the inside and lacked a
rally. TROPICALDEPRESSION tired.

PAPA TONY vied for the early lead three wide, then went on to set the pace on the backstretch, then was headed leaving the turn and was resurgent in the
furlong grounds to edge clear late to prove best under a drive. ALL TACKED UP was well rated early, then made a steady advance on the turn and was four
wide by the quarter pole and loomed boldly, then gained a short advantage by the furlong marker but hung in the final furlong, second best. SOUL FIGHT
was settled back early, then advanced on the inside on the far turn, then finished evenly in the drive, bested rest. TROUBLE COFFEE was settled back
early, advanced three wide on the far turn but offered no late rally. CRAZY KATER was four wide into the first turn, chased the pace four wide and tired.
MOON MEISTER vied for the early lead on the inside and stopped. QUICKER chased the early pace on the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
MY GIRL BLUE was reserved early, advanced four wide on the far turn, shifted out six wide in the stretch, closed well to edge clear late under a drive.
SLEEPY N JOYFUL set the pace while clear, dug in gamely in the drive but was caught late, second best. TIME SENSITIVE trackled the pace setter and
made a three wide bid by the quarter pole but flattened out, held show award. EMPRESS NEFERTITI was four wide into the first turn, then was settled
early, came six wide into the drive and had a belated rally. MEEMOO chased the early pace and was three to four wide on the turn and faded. BLUEBERRY
DUDETTE chased the pace on the inside and tired. MISS JASSER dull effort.
