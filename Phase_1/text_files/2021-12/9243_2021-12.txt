Footnotes
ANGEL OF VERDUN set the pace along the inside, inched clear to a loose advantage at the nine sixteenths pole, added to that margin in upper stretch,
drifted outwardly through the final sixteenth while tiring as outer foes closed in, but lasted to the wire. HAVINFUNYET trailed, improved inside of tiring foes
turning for home before shifting four wide passing the three sixteenths pole, then rallied outside of the leading pair in the final furlong, surged to produce a
late bid, but missed. GLANCE saved ground off of the pace, tipped three wide at the quarter pole, grinded away at ANGEL OF VERDUN's margin through
midstretch, but was herded outwardly by that foe entering the final sixteenth, which caused him to flop back to his left lead in the process, kept on to
produce a late bid as his entry-mate rallied alongside, but got outfinished by that rival while missing. NORTHERN ALLIANCE stalked along the inside,
shifted outside of the leader entering the lane, but only managed to chase through upper stretch before fading through the final furlong. CALAJA pressed
the pace two wide around the first turn, backed off to stalk down the backstretch, but faded at the five sixteenths pole. SUNDAY SCHEMING tracked three
wide, chased under urging around the far turn, then tired entering the lane.

Footnotes
CHAPEL BARN set the pace along the inside, cleared a pressing rival passing the half mile pole, managed a loose lead around the turn with her ears
pricked, then inched further away through upper stretch, and was ridden out to the wire. THE GRAY BLUR chased two to three wide into the turn, stayed on
to bid for place outside of a pair of foes at the furlong grounds, and prevailed for that position late. HOLY SPIRIT pressed the pace setter from the outside,
but allowed that foe to clear away into the turn, chased around the bend then vied for place between horses through the final furlong, but was outfinished by
an outer rival. AW SHUCKS stalked along the inside, bid for place inside of foes in upper stretch while proving no match for the clear leader, but yielded
late. HARPER'S DEELITE saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, but lacked a rally. MONEY COMETH was outrun. SIR
ADVENT tracked the pace three to four wide and outside of foes, but was done early.

FIRST GLIMPSE vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, inched a clear margin at the quarter pole, held sway from a chasing KISSALOT through the lane,
and widened a bit late. KISSALOT prompted the pace three wide, took aim on a leading FIRST GLIMPSE in upper stretch, but only managed to chase that
foe home, and was second best. DR. BENNY vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with those foes passing the
five-sixteenths, but safely held show. WEBCAM broke a step slowly at the start, stalked four wide, but faded on his left lead through the lane. HERO
DRAGON tracked along the inside, but never got involved. VEGAS DELETE showed little. TRUMP FLAG got outrun.

Footnotes
MORE THAN BLESSED saved ground off of the pace, steadied when running up on horses heels turning for home, shifted two wide and into tight quarters
between horses passing the quarter pole, got minorly impacted by an outer foe cutting in at the three sixteenths, but shifted to the rail for clear sailing shortly
after, commenced a rail rally approaching midstretch, surged inside of the leader late, and got up on the wire. BRIAR JUMPER bobbled into an inner foe at
the start, trailed the field, took the far turn in the three path, moved up between horses entering the lane, but recklessly cut inwardly while not clear of an
inner rival at the three sixteenths pole, rallied between horses to take aim on the clear leader at the furlong grounds, drove past that foe at the sixteenth
pole, but was outfinished by an inner foe late. VINCITORE settled far off of the pace two wide, took the far turn four wide before tipping five wide entering
the lane, then rallied outside of foes through the final furlong, attempted a late bid, but did not have enough to catch the leaders. SHIPPINGPORT set a
clear pace, held sway through upper stretch, but awkwardly flopped back to his left lead at the furlong grounds, got headed a sixteenth out, and weakened.
PAYNT BATTLE tracked two wide and between horses around both turns, but steadied when interfered by an inward shifting BRIAR JUMPER at the three
sixteenths pole, then kept on thereafter, but failed to reach a tiring foe for a minor reward. AMERICAN UNION stalked from the four to three path around the
first turn, but came under a drive into the far turn, failed to respond while only chasing through upper stretch, then got outkicked at the furlong grounds.
SHAR'S TREASURE took a mild bump from an outer foe at the start, got taken back from between horses passing the wire for the first time, settled off of
the pace in the three path, got floated to the four path around the far turn, then failed to factor while hanging on his left lead. BORGOBYTHESEA stalked the
clear leader two wide, chased that foe around the far turn, but drifted outwardly a bit at the three sixteenths pole while starting to tire, and weakened
thereafter. FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN tugged to an inside stalking position in the two path into the first turn, tucked to the rail around that bend, but
weakened in upper stretch. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY WAS CONDUCTED REVIEWING BRIAR JUMPER'S INFRACTION IN UPPER STRETCH, BUT
RESULTED IN NO CHANGE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
DREWHUSTLE pulled his way between horses into the first turn to a clear advantage, settled leaving that bend, showed the way as foes inched closer into
the far turn, but drove clear once again passing the quarter pole, and held late under strong hand urging. BEHEMAH STAR tracked from the four to three
path around the first turn, but came under a drive to keep pace at the half mile pole, sustained chasing position through the far turn, briefly faded entering
the lane, but tipped four wide before regaining stride, rebroke and produced a late rally, but did not have enough to reel in the clear leader late.
MARTINIZED laid off of the pace in the three to two path around the first turn, cut the corner entering the lane, and chased along the rail thereafter.
DRILLING REPORT stalked three to two wide around the first turn, drifted to the four path entering the lane while failing to keep pace with the leader, then
chased that foe home and failed to produce a bid. DUSTY BOY was slow into stride and trailed the field, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and passed
tiring rivals. MUFFIN NUTS stalked along the inside, shifted off of the rail entering the lane, chased between horses through upper stretch, but faded. OUR
FREDDIE MAC laid far off of the pace while shifting out to the four path around the first turn, took the far turn four wide before drifting to the six path entering
the lane, and tired.

Footnotes
MAIRSILS FIRST broke outwardly sparking trouble for outer foes, established a clear margin into the first turn, managed a loose lead thereafter, widened
that advantage at the quarter pole, hung on her left lead through upper stretch, changed over passing the furlong pole, then tired late, but lasted to the wire.
LIVY B took a bump from an inner foe before being pinched back between horses at the start, settled far off of the pace along the inside, swung to the five
path at the quarter pole, rallied while drifting inwardly approaching midstretch, lugged out from left handed pressure in the final furlong, flopped back to her
left lead inside the final sixteenth, shifted inwards while engaging the leader and attempting a late bid, but ran out of ground. HERO'S DAUGHTER took a
bump from an inner foe into an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside, then two wide around the far turn as the clear leader's closest pursuer, but
shifted to the four path while failing to keep pace with that foe at the quarter pole, delayed her lead change to the three-sixteenths, but only managed to
chase the leader thereafter, and got outkicked for place in the final sixteenth. SUPERTALEOFHOUDINI tracked from the two path around the first turn, but
chased under urging two wide around the far turn, and stayed on evenly. EMILY WHO broke sharply, but shifted inwardly soon after the start causing an
inner foe to clip heels, then saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. TAYLOR'S WISH stalked three wide, but faded at the five sixteenths pole.
MAGICAL STARDUST took a brush from an inner foe before clipping heels with an outer rival soon after the start, then rated far off of the pace two wide,
and failed to factor. TAPPIN'TIME laid off of the pace three wide, and got outrun.

Footnotes
BERNABREEZY hesitated a bit at the start, rated off of the pace, commenced a rally while shifting four wide turning for home, unleashed a relentless run in
upper stretch to sweep past the dueling pair at the furlong pole, quickly drove clear, and was wrapped up late. HIDDEN WONDER prompted the pace two
wide and from between horses while in the three path around the first turn, vied among those rivals down the backstretch, led from an outer GUN SLINGIN
around the far turn after an inner foe weakened, dueled with that rival through upper stretch, but offered little resistance to an outer bidding foe at the furlong
grounds, and proved second best. MY AIM IS TRUE stalked along the inside, then from behind the leading pair while in the two path around the far turn, but
failed to progress in upper stretch, shifted to the rail at the three sixteenths pole, and chased to reach a minor share. GUN SLINGIN pressed the leading pair
from the four path around the first turn, vied with those foes down the backstretch, sparred with only HIDDEN WONDER around the far turn, sustained the
duel through upper stretch, but failed to keep pace while getting outkicked at the furlong grounds, flopped back to his left lead passing that marker, and lost
show a sixteenth from home. PORONUI raced in midpack two wide, tracked the leading pair three wide around the far turn, but was outkicked by an outer
foe at the quarter pole, then faded in midstretch. SUPER FIRE set the pace inside of a pair of pressing rivals while staying off of the rail around the first turn,
tucked to the inside down the backstretch, but weakened into the far turn. OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS bumped the outer part of the gate at the start, and got
outrun.

Footnotes
MAID OF HONOR rated back from between horses early on, settled off of the pace two wide, took the far turn three to four wide, rallied outside of foes
through upper stretch to bid passing the three sixteenths, drove past the leader approaching the furlong pole, drew clear, and was wrapped up through the
final sixteenth. NOW YUS CANT LEAVE saved ground off of the pace, shifted four wide passing the three sixteenths pole, but exchanged solid bumps with
an outer BELIEVING in the process which knocked both horses off stride, regained stride between foes passing the furlong pole, and stayed on late to reach
place on the wire. GAMBLING CAT pressed the pace two wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole, vied through upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer foe
approaching the final furlong, kept on thereafter, but was nailed on the wire for place. I'M FINE laid forwardly placed three wide, but was outkicked by an
outer foe in upper stretch, flopped back to his left lead at the furlong grounds, and chased between horses thereafter. BELIEVING banged the outer part of
the gate at the start, trailed the field, got rank briefly around the first turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, then five wide at the three sixteenths pole, but
was bumped off stride by an inner foe shortly after, returned the favor approaching the furlong pole, and flattened out on his left lead. MO NORMAL tracked
two wide and between horses, rated off of the pace around the far turn, but encountered traffic among rivals through upper stretch, trailed entering the final
furlong, then moved up in the late stages without ever being asked for run. HOHOHOHO set the pace inside of a pressing rival, but was headed by that foe
in upper stretch, and gave way at the three sixteenths pole. SPELLBINDING stalked along the inside, but faded through the lane.

Footnotes
ELSIE GIRL stalked outside of the clear leader from the three path around the turn, bid entering the lane, led before dueling with an inner bidding foe
through the lane, irrelevantly bumped that foe a sixteenth from home, and held gamely. DELTA TRAVELER stalked along the inside, slipped through a
narrow hole passing the quarter pole to bid for the lead with ELSIE GIRL, dueled with that foe thereafter, took an inconsequential bump from that rival at the
sixteenth pole, and failed to reach level terms. MERCEDES LADIES chased from midpack in the two to three path around the turn, then stayed on to best
an outer foe for show. CHEAPSKATE DIVA hopped inwardly and bumped the gate, raced far off of the pace three wide, gained four to five wide entering the
lane, reached show at the furlong pole, but leveled off and lost show to an inner foe. STANDUPDON'TKNEEL broke a step slowly, and failed to factor.
SADIE'S RANSOM broke outwardly, sped clear, but caved between horses passing the quarter pole. ANSLIE'S GUMDROP broke inwardly, saved ground
at the rear, and never got involved. SCRAPPY broke slowly and got outrun. THE RIDER OF DELTA TRAVELER CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER
OF ELSIE GIRL FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE SIXTEENTH POLE, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS
