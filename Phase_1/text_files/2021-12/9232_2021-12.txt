Footnotes
VIENNA CODE was rated under a tight hold, drafted in the two path early on the turn, shifted four wide while asked at the three-eighths, ranged up on the
outside, took the lead into the stretch then kicked clear and proved much the best under a solid hand-ride. HONEY MONEY was rated just off the pace on
the inside, came under urging around the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, moved out under a drive into the final furlong and earned the
place while no match for the winner. CHOOSE HAPPINESS was last to commence, settled on the inside, moved to the two path while roused at the
three-eighths, shifted four wide late on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while able to safely secure the show.
MAKINGCENTS showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, lost the lead into the stretch and
tired. FROST ME stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and came up empty. EPONA'S
DREAM settled just off the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the turn and had nothing left. PENDOLINO acted-up at the start and refused then was
walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
ALPINE QUEEN stalked the pace on the outside, took the lead in the three path at the three-eighths, shook clear into the stretch, responded well in the
drive and just held under strong urging. FREDDYMO FACTOR broke a step slow and bumped the hindquarters of a foe, moved up under urging then raced
just off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, came four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner into the final
furlong, gained into the final sixteenth but just missed while able to get the place. APRIL ANTICS settled off the pace, angled from the rail to the four path on
the turn, floated six wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the show. LINNY KATE was coaxed along on the outside, chased four wide on the turn,
was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. RAFFINITY showed the way down the backstretch under some pressure, vied inside
on the turn, lost the lead at the three-eighths, dropped back into the stretch and tired. GAME THEORY settled towards the rear, was urged three wide on the
turn and failed to rally. STORMI CAT LADY was urged along at the rear, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn and failed to threaten. CREATIVE
LEGACY bumped with a rival at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, dropped back outside the half-mile pole, went three then four wide on the turn
and faltered.

closer with five furlongs to run, went four wide on the turn, was roused nearing the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained to make a

a foe at the start, settled off the pace, moved closer near the five-eighths pole, saved ground on the turn, was given her cue near the five-sixteenths, made a
rail bid into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but held the show. VEGAS WEEKEND was taken in hand early then rated on the
outside, stalked four wide on the turn, was asked coming to the five-sixteenths, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, battled under a drive into upper stretch,
dropped back into the final furlong and tired then missed the show. HALO CITY brushed with a rival at the start, moved closer with five furlongs to run, was
roused in the two path on the turn, drifted out near the furlong marker and came up empty. EMILIA'S MOON broke a step slow, was urged along at the rear,

Footnotes
CHATEAU broke well then was hustled, showed the way while well out in the track, went around the turn in the three to four path, responded well under a
brisk hand-ride in the stretch, was given one light tap with a down-turned crop at the sixteenth-pole then continued under a hand-ride to the wire while much
the best. JAXON TRAVELER was fractious in the gate, switched out early then chased the pace, pursued the winner in the four to five path on the turn,
turned into upper stretch under a drive and proved no match while able to get the place. DRAFTED broke a step slow, settled on the outside, was roused
four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and missed the place while clear for the show. MAJESTIC DUNHILL was fractious in the gate, broke in
the air and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, saved ground on the turn and came up empty. WENDELL FONG settled off the pace, was asked
three wide on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and faltered.

SANDRO THE GREAT stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid before the half-mile pole, vied in the three path on the turn, shook clear coming to the
quarter-pole, responded well while remaining on his inside lead in the stretch and proved much the best under strong urging. GOT THE GOLD broke out
and brushed the gate, settled on the outside, was urged five wide on the turn and got up for the place. LUCKY BRODY moved out at the rear of the field,
was urged four wide on the turn then driven six wide into the stretch and improved to get the show. MY BROTHER NEIL settled off the pace, was urged four
wide between horses on the turn and lacked the needed response. VIKING ZIM settled towards the back, advanced closer with five furlongs to run, moved
out near the half-mile pole, dropped in to save ground on the turn and failed to impact. OLIVER'S FORTUNE disputed the pace on the outside of a foe then
inside of a rival near the half-mile pole, vied along the rail on the turn and tired. GREY GIANT bobbled at the start then bumped with a rival, raced towards
the front, was urged between foes while three wide on the turn and came up empty. ADDICTED TO YOU broke a bit awkwardly then brushed with a foe,
settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. REUNION TOUR bumped with a rival at the start,
settled towards the rear, was shuffled back leaving the backstretch, shifted four wide before the three-eighths and was no factor. MIGHTY MEISTER was
well placed inside of a foe, dropped back under urging in the two path on the turn and capitulated. BRENNAN'S WAR saved ground on the turn, came three
