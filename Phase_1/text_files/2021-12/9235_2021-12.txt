Footnotes
MARKHAMIAN tracked outside the early leaders, took over outside STORMY PATTERN coming off the turn and widened through the final furlong under a
drive. STORMY PATTERN vied outside MISCHIEVOUS GUY from the start, got the best of that dispute after a half-mile but was quickly hooked from
outside by MARKHAMIAN, could not natch strides after straightening away for the drive, but held well for the place. CAPTURE THE TIME chased after the
leading trio four wide to the stretch, and finished one-paced outside. AGARRAMESIPUEDES took an awkward side-step to the right at the break, lagged far
back for a half, came four wide into the lane and rallied mildly for the last major share. MISCHIEVOUS GUY dueled inside STORMY PATTERN for a half,
and weakened approaching the stretch. LORD JAXSTON lunged at the start to get away behind the field, and was outrun inside. CRY MACHO was finished
early outside. TREPID was four wide into the turn, and could not reach contention. MORETHANICANHANDLE showed brief speed, and could not keep
pace around the turn inside.

Footnotes
MS BIG SPRING broke quickly and was sent to the lead early, showed the way on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the turn,
and held her margin under a drive to the wire. FOXY LADY chased the leaders between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, moved up to
challenge from the two path while racing around the far turn and dueled on the outside down the lane but could not get by the winner. NOBLE INTENTIONS
raced off the pace between horses in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path, improved position in upper stretch and was outkicked late.
HEART OF GOD broke a bit slowly, raced at the back of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn four wide and gained some
ground down the lane while finishing evenly. SENSIBLE MYTH trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, switched to the outside
entering the stretch and gained ground late, but ran out of room to threaten. CANARSIE ANGEL tracked the leaders on the outside in the opening stages,
raced in the three path around the turn and weakened between horses in the final furlong. LAWN DART pressed the pace on the inside under a hold up the
backstretch, dropped back slightly while saving ground around the turn and continued to tire in the stretch.

the winner to the sixteenth pole and settled for second best late. TESTIMONIAL was in range three wide and lacked the needed rally. SUNDAY SUZANNE
failed to menace while racing four and five wide. SCHAKOLAD played no factor while racing three wide. EVELYN dueled outside of SHAWNEE PRINCESS

Footnotes
EMIGRANTEDESILLUSO absorbed a bump from SOVEREIGN OF SPEED at the break, eyed the latter from a distance up the backstretch, closed in
steadily entering the far turn, took over outside the spent leader approaching the stretch and drove off. HENRYTHETHIRD was unhurried early inside,
began moving three wide after six furlongs, and overhauled GRAND SIR from outside late for second. GRAND SIR bumped with MACHO TIME at the start,
raced well back through the opening half-mile, took closer order in the two-path around the far turn, rallied between rivals into second leaving the furlong
grounds, and was outfinished for that spot while swapping back to his left lead late. FROSTY WARRIOR raced four wide much of the way, rallied into the
stretch, then flattened out. MACHO TIME got bumped between GRAND SIR and SIR SAMUEL and squeezed back at the start, raced far back for six
furlongs, and improved outside without threatening. SOVEREIGN OF SPEED broke out into the eventual winner, sped off early while well removed from the
rail, and was used up by the top of the stretch. SIR SAMUEL bumped with MACHO TIME at the start, gave distant chase to the leaders for a half-mile, and
tired. BIGBOYSTOYS was four wide early, and raced far back throughout. ONE MORE DAY was finished early inside. DAVID'S CUPID was three wide into
the first turn, and retired after a half.

Footnotes
SAND DANCER raced four wide around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, remained four wide while racing
around the far turn and gained ground on the outside to the wire, wearing down his rivals late. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) showed the way while saving ground
around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, dueled down the lane and was caught while drifting out in late
stretch. TRIPLE JEOPARDY raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, navigated the
far turn still in the two path, switched to the inside in upper stretch and gained ground late while drifting out in the final sixteenth of a mile. OUTSHINE raced
in the three path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path, angled in entering
the stretch and finished evenly between horses. DUROCHER trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to move
up while racing in the four path around the far turn, swung wider still entering the stretch and passed tiring horses on the outside from there. BORU saved
ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn and was outkicked in late stretch.
FLY THE W raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the frontrunner between horses up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three
path, dueled in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. SEIZE THE HAY raced off the pace in the three path around the first turn and up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path, swung wide entering the stretch and came up empty from there. ARCHER ROAD saved ground
around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the far turn and
continued to tire in the stretch.

Footnotes
GREATITUDE stalked the pace in the three path, took over near the eighth pole and drew clear under moderate urging. RITA MARGA chased the pace
three wide, tipped four wide in upper stretch, could not gain on the winner but stayed on to gain the place in the final strides. AMERICAN PYRAMID set a
clear pace in the two path, led to midstretch, was no match for the winner from there and lost second in the final strides. BERAVINA broke a bit awkwardly,
steadied soon after, advanced between foes down the backstretch, chased the pace from the rail around the turn and lacked a rally. FRIENDSHIP ROAD
saved ground to no avail. GINGER SPARKLE played no factor while racing two wide. MISS YEARWOOD failed to menace while racing two wide.
CHARMED WAY was outrun while racing four wide. STARSHIP SPRINKLES was outrun inside.

Footnotes
DEL REY DOLLY pursued the leaders three wide between horses into the turn, wrested command outside MABEE LUCKYNWILD leaving the eighth-pole
and edged away all out. PEARLINTHEROUGH brushed the left side of the gate and BELLA ROMANCE at the start, lagged at the back through the turn,
fanned widest for the drive and found her best stride belatedly. BELLA ROMANCE brushed with PEARLINTHEROUGH at the start, advanced outside the
leaders four wide after a half-mile, loomed outside DEL REY DOLLY through midstretch, and was outfinished. HANNITA'S EMPIRE bumped lightly with
MABEE LUCKYNWILD at the start, hustled up early inside, awaited room around the turn, entered the stretch behind a wall of horses, moved out for
clearance and finished evenly. MABEE LUCKYNWILD bumped lightly with HANNITA'S EMPIRE at the start, chased after KINGSTON QUEEN to the turn,
took over with five-sixteenths remaining, and stayed on to deep stretch before yielding. KINGSTON QUEEN cleared to the inside with the early lead, got
collared by MABEE LUCKYNWILD five-sixteenths out, and gave way.

Footnotes
MISTER LEONARDO raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to duel for the lead
entering the far turn, took over and saved ground from there, and held his margin to the wire under a drive. EMOJI GUY bumped with the horse to his
outside leaving the gate, saved ground around the turn, raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path, drifted
out wide entering the stretch, gained ground down the lane and was turned back by the winner, the best of the rest. DIGITAL FOOTPRINT saved ground
around the first turn, led the way on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn, couldn't go with the top two in the
stretch and finished evenly. UNIVERSAL PAYDAY raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack between
horses, trailed the field around the far turn, cut to the outside with a furlong to go and gained ground to the wire. DR. SHANE raced in the four path around
the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack under a hold, navigated the far turn from the two path, began a bid between horses
approaching the quarter pole and was outkicked in late stretch. POCO CHARLIE raced at the back of the pack in the three path around the first turn and up
the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and was empty from there. LUCAS N' LORI was away from the gate slowly, bumping with the
horse to his inside in the process, raced into traffic and was forced to steady heading into the first turn, saved ground from there, raced inside up the
backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and made no bid. NIETZSCHE raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leaders on
the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and tired on the outside in the stretch.

Footnotes
TELEPHONE TALKER was bumped at the start, raced well back two wide around the first turn, circled five wide around the far turn, angled in in upper
stretch as the pacesetter drifted out, closed inside of that foe, took command near the sixteenth pole and powered clear. BROWN STORM (CHI) set a clear
pace in the two path, drifted out to the six path in upper stretch, angled back in near the eighth pole, fought on through the lane but was no match for the
winner in the final sixteenth. MIRA MISSION lacked early speed while racing three wide and just outside of the winner, advanced four wide around the far
turn then flattened out in the final furlong. HAWKISH saved ground off the early pace, went three wide between foes around the far turn and lacked the
needed rally. FLYING SCOTSMAN stalked the pace two wide between foes and came up empty in the lane. NOBLE INDY stalked the pace three wide and
faded in the lane. SHIRL'S SPEIGHT bumped with the winner at the start, raced three and four wide in midpack and tired in the lane. MO HAWK had early
speed inside and steadily faded.

Footnotes
HAIL TO THEE dwelt at the start to spot the field five lengths or so, advanced up the backstretch, cruised up three wide outside the leaders midway on the
far turn, took over from LA MAQUINA in upper stretch and drove clear. REFUAH leapt at the break coming out two to three lengths slow, went along under a
firm hold early, steadied toward the end of the backstretch, moved out four wide rallying off the far turn, shifted inward with a sixteenth remaining and went
clear of the rest. SIMMS was four wide around the first turn, moved in a couple paths in easy striking range through the middle stages, idled under pressure
after six furlongs, kept on evenly through upper stretch, then checked inside REFUAH and came over on LA MAQUINA with a sixteenth remaining, and was
clear for the show while cautiously handled near the finish. LA MAQUINA set the pace inside for six furlongs, was no match for the winner in upper stretch,
and steadied inside SIMMS while weakening late. GOOCH GO BRAGH raced in the second flight two wide for six furlongs, was in a bit tight at the top of the
stretch, but had no final response. GREY CHARMER prompted the early pace, and faded steadily after six furlongs. GHOSTINYOU tired inside after a
half-mile. LABAN M MO was a step slow at the start, and never factored. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START FOCUSING ON HAIL
TO THEE, AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF SIMMS AGAINST REFUAH, ALONG WITH AN OBJECTION BY THE TRAINER OF LA
MAQUINA AGAINST SIMMS, THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.
