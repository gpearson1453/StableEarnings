Footnotes
HANNITA'S EMPIRE set a clear pace in the two path, steadily drifted out into about the ten path while drawing off under right-handed urging to deep stretch
then was geared down late. STAKE N EGGZ chased the winner in the three path, came under a drive midway around the turn, was no match for the winner
but churned on to hold second. MANGORITA hit the starting gate, dropped far back early, went two wide around the turn, tipped out in upper stretch and
was along for the show. UNCAPTURED FAITH chased the pace five wide down the backstretch, angled into the two path entering the turn, continued to
give distant chase to midstretch and lacked a closing bid. INDYZAN was outrun inside. QUEEN'S BEST chased the pace four wide and tired in the lane.
ANGELIC STORM saved ground and failed to menace. MOSA MIA had early speed three wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
CHUCKY dueled for the lead on the outside through the opening half mile, led the field outright while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear entering
the stretch and held off a late closer under a drive. SEAZAN raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began to improve position
while racing the two and three paths around the turn, continued to gain ground on the outside while drifting out down the lane, and could not got get by the
winner. SAMARONTI raced between horses in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole,
dueled in upper stretch, gave way with a furlong to go and drifted out mildly from there. THORN raced off the pace between horses early, saved ground
around the turn, switched outside to find racing room near the eighth pole and gained ground mildly in late stretch. MONY dueled for the lead under a hold
on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the turn and faded down the lane. MISTA DONZELLA raced off the
pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three and four path, swung wider still entering the stretch and was empty from there. NO
COMMISSION settled in well behind the leaders on the inside for the run up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and tired in the stretch.
NAVAJO CREED trailed the field on the inside in the early going, pulled up while racing around the turn and was vanned off after walking onto the van.

Footnotes
SISTER NELL was unhurried two wide for six furlongs, followed behind LADY PUCHI along the inside after straightening away for the drive, got through on
the rail when the latter drifted out slightly in deep stretch and was up in time. LADY PUCHI saved ground on the turns within range, slipped through on the
fence to take over in upper stretch, drifted out a path allowing the winner through, and was outfinished. BRAVO KITTEN was allowed to settle early toward
the inside, swung five wide rallying off the far turn, had aim outside the leaders into the final furlong, swapped back to her left lead in deep stretch and did
not have enough. BLYTHE SPIRIT vied early inside CASTLE BORN, edged clear after six furlongs, got overhauled from inside into the stretch, and
salvaged the last major share. GOLDEN EFFECT was forwardly placed three wide for six furlongs, and lacked a solid closing response. ZAMBAK raced in
striking distance two wide to the far turn, shifted out a couple more paths approaching the stretch, and could not gain. INFLUENCING passed only tired
horses. CUPERE was never a factor in the second flight throughout. BELLWETHER was outrun inside. SPREAD JOY was far back throughout. GOLDEN
BELIEF was never involved. CASTLE BORN pressed BLYTHE SPIRIT from outside, and gave way after six furlongs.

POIEMA set the pace along the rail, edged clear in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. LIAM'S KISS was in a bit tight after the start, advanced four
wide around the turn and finished well. FULTON MARKET steadied at the start, advanced inside down the backstretch and around much of the turn, angled
three wide nearing the quarter pole, had aim outside of the winner in upper stretch but went evenly through the lane and lost second late. MANDORLA was
pinched back at the start, raced well back three wide, came five wide into the lane and rallied belatedly. KAEKO failed to menace while racing two wide. LI'L
MISS CAMILLE prompted the winner two wide and tired in the lane. STELLAR RIDE played no factor while racing four wide. FAWNING was outrun while
racing two wide. SOUL OF AN ANGEL trailed inside.

Footnotes
WORLD GONE WILD dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, continued to battle down the lane, was brushed
lightly by BABY MO passing the eighth pole, and dug in gamely in late stretch to hold the win. WAR STAR tracked the leaders between horses in the
opening stages, saved ground around the turn, and gained ground steadily on the outside down the stretch, just missing the victory. BABY MO dueled for
the lead on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle from the two path around the turn, drifted in mildly nearing the sixteenth
pole, brushing lightly with WORLD GONE WILD in the process, and couldn't get by that rival. THE GREAT KATH raced between horses in the middle of the
pack up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began an inside bid approaching the three sixteenths pole and gained ground from the rail to the
wire. NURSE JUDY bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, came up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, raced into tight
quarters and was forced to steady entering the turn, continued in the two path from there, swung wide entering the stretch and was outkicked. NIKEE KAN
raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and weakened late. DADDY'S JOY trailed the field up
the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and was empty from there. MACKENZIE'S GIRL hit the gate and
then bumped with the horse to her inside at the break, recovered to press the pace between horses in the early going, dropped back to chase the leaders
while saving ground around the turn and tired in the stretch.

ZAMFIR tracked the early leaders three wide, took over outside EMICRACK coming to midstretch and edged clear, then lugged in swapping leads several
times and had enough to hold on. WAR FEATHER was outsprinted early, came four wide beginning to find stride leaving the turn, and was getting to the
winner from outside too late. CAMPEADOR raced three to four wide around the turn, gained gradually through the lane but needed a bit more. EMICRACK
(CHI) pressed the early pace outside, wrested a short lead with less than a quarter-mile remaining, got headed by the winner a furlong out, and gave way.
MR EVERYTHING went along in the second flight early, shifted out five wide to the stretch, and gained mildly without threatening. LUCKY AS A SEVEN
saved ground through an even effort. SMILING TEUFLES pressed the early pace inside, stayed on to upper stretch, then gave way. MAKE A MOVE was
outrun throughout. DEPUTY INDY broke slowly, and was outrun inside. UNDER THE COUVERS sprinted clear approaching the turn, got headed by
EMICRACK after three-eighths of a mile, and folded up through the lane.

Footnotes
RED ROAD had early speed, rated inside, advanced two wide around the far turn, came three wide into the lane, moved to the front near the sixteenth pole,
quickly drove clear and then held off the runner-up's late surge. SKYLANDER bumped with BAILADOR at the start, saved ground well off the early pace,
angled out in upper stretch, surged outside and ran out of ground. NEVER SAY KNOW (IRE) prompted the pace two wide, took the lead near the
five-sixteenths pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth pole then weakened. FLASH FROST saved ground off the pace, advanced between
foes rounding the far turn but was one-paced in the lane. GENERAL'S DUTY bumped with STEAL SUNSHINE nearing the first turn, got out entering that
bend, raced four wide around most of the turn, went three wide around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. FREDO chased the pace two wide around
the first turn, three wide around the far turn and faded in the lane. BELOVED WARRIOR failed to menace while racing two and three wide. STEAL
SUNSHINE bumped with GENERAL'S DUTY nearing the first turn, raced off the pace three and four wide and never threatened. BICKELL saved ground in
midpack and came up empty in the lane. BAILADOR bumped with SKYLANDER at the start, set the pace along the rail and gave way leaving the
five-sixteenths pole. KING TSUNAMI was shut off at the start, trailed inside early, went three wide around the far turn and made little impact.
KANTHARTANA veered out at the start, steadied early and played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
MARISA'S MISSION raced off the pace in the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path passing the three
eighths pole, was carried wide coming off the far turn and dueled the length of the stretch, drifting in some in the final furlong and prevailing in the final
strides. EASY STRIDE raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid while saving ground
around the far turn, swung wide into the stretch and dueled gamely down the lane, drifting out mildly in midstretch and narrowly missing at the wire.
RESIDENT LIBERAL raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, ran into traffic in the two path and
was forced to steady slightly while racing around the far turn and improved position mildly in late stretch. CALL BROS saved ground around the first turn,
raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and finished evenly between horses in the stretch.
BATTLE CREEK raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn
from the three path and was outfinished on the outside in the final furlong. BUFFALO MAX trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the
backstretch, began to move up while racing in the two and three path around the turn and flattened out from there. FINDING MISCHIEF dueled for the lead
while saving ground around the first turn, dropped back to stalk the frontrunner on the inside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge between horses
while racing around the far turn and tired entering the stretch. JUST PLUNGE hopped up leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead from the three path
around the first turn, took over to lead outright racing up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn, gave way approaching the three
eighths pole and tired further in the stretch.

Footnotes
MISS AURAMET sprinted clear soon after the start, cruised along widening the lead around the turn, was roused mildly through upper stretch and faced no
challengers. FOUZIA pursued MISS AURAMET two wide for three furlongs, moved in turning for home, and lasted for the place on the rail. REINAGOL
broke in bumping solidly with BERNIE'S MISTRESS at a cost of two lengths, moved out from the two-path to be four wide late on the turn, advanced
through upper stretch and ran on evenly through the final stages just missing second. CAN'T BUY LOVE was outsprinted three wide to the quarter-pole, and
improved mildly on the far outside late. BERNIE'S MISTRESS absorbed a hard bump from REINAGOL at the start, and was outrun inside. MUMBAI took an
awkward step along the inside midway on the turn, and had no late response. COOKIE DOUGH chased three wide early, and gave way approaching the
stretch.

Footnotes
STRIKE HARD advanced five wide down the backstretch, bid three wide around the turn, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, drew clear in upper
stretch, angled in, continued on the left lead through the lane and drew off under a drive. A. P.'S SECRET advanced between foes down the backstretch,
took the lead near the half-mile pole, angled in entering the turn, could not keep pace with the top two nearing the lane, angled out near the quarter pole,
re-bid in the final sixteenth and was just up for the place. SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING advanced between foes down the backstretch, took the lead between
rivals near the seven-sixteenths pole, vied between the top two around much of the turn, could not keep pace with the winner from the quarter pole, was a
clear second through much of the stretch but was nailed on the wire for that position. ROD TWO ROD chase the pace three wide and lacked a rally. THE
SKIPPER TOO stumbled at the start, raced four wide and never threatened. LUNI SIMA was outrun while racing two wide. KING OF TRUTH was bumped
soon after the start, sped to the front but was through nearing the half-mile pole. HARD ROCK GOLD broke inwardly and bumped KING OF TRUTH soon
after the start, showed some speed, stopped nearing the turn and was eased.
