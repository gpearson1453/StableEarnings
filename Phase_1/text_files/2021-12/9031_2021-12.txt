Footnotes
SASSY SUE'S BAND unhurried in the early part, moved up on the inside around the final turn, angled out entering the home stretch, dueled down the lane
with MARAMA and was just up. MARAMA raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout, took the advantage early down the final stretch, dueled late
and just missed. FASHION MERIT raced within striking distance, made a late bid and proved no match for the top two. SOCIAL GALAXY went to the front,
saved ground and weakened down the stretch. KLEINMEISTER lacked early speed, saved ground around the second turn, moved up and finished evenly.
MISS PRONOUNCE void of early speed and passed tired ones. BEAR TOOTH PASS raced in the middle of the field, came around the first turn on the
outside and faded. GLADS LOVE CAT vied for the early lead, raced outside around the final turn and dropped back. SALT LIFE ANGEL always raced near
the back, lost contact with the field and was eased to the wire.

Footnotes
EPIC (ARG) unhurried in the beginning, racing within striking distance, made a bid down the home stretch, took the lead and won under steady urging.
NATEALYZE pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished for the win. SUMMER APPEAL lacked early speed, came around the
second turn wide, made a late gain and finished willingly. UNWANTED INTRUDER raced in the back of the pack, came around the final turn four wide,
showed late interest, finishing wide, but was no factor. SINGANDCRYINDUBAI went to the front, drove clear, moved to the rail, drifted out around the final
turn and faded. NO PLANS lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. THATS IT IMLEAVING raced near the middle of the field, made a mild
bid and faded. HOT TEN pressed the early pace and was finished early. CLASSIC GREELEY raced near the back, steadied around the second turn, while
racing on the rail and lacked a late bid. TOO MUCH BOURBON raced within contention, came around the first turn on the outside, dropped back, lost
contact and was eased.
