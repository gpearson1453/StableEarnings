Footnotes
YOU ARE AWESOME tracked four wide early, rallied in the stretch five wide, closed determinedly and was up late. FLAMING HOT dueled on the early lead,
gained a clear in mid stretch, held grudgingly and just missed. EXCLUSIVE DONALD was never far back, rallied four wide in the stretch and finished well.
STARSHIP TAXI raced inside early, angled out three wide in the stretch, needed more late. HURRICANE NATION dueled until mid stretch, then weakened
late. HIT THIS TOWN was bumped at the start and settled, closed a gap late. JOE COOL set a pressured pace and tired in mid stretch . SILVER DOLLAR
CITY was no threat. VALIANT THOR had brief foot, and was through early. PABLO'S QUEST was outrun.
