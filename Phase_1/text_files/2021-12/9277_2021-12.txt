Footnotes
DONTFORGETTOBLINK , near the inner rail stalking the pace around the turn, found room inside SLOE GIN FIZ turning for home, gained the lead late and
held sway. WINSTON'S GOLD saved ground on the turn, raced in the two path in upper stretch and nicely split rivals near the sixteenth pole to gain the
place. SLOE GIN BIZ disputed the pace two wide for a half mile, drifted to the three path entering the stretch and weakened late. NIGHT BOSS , three deep
chasing the pace around the turn, was fanned to the four path turning for home and finished willingly. DOLICE VITA raced between horses around the turn
and lacked a rally. SHANGHAI CANDY raced well off the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor. AUCTION KINGDOM , along the inner rail on the turn,
was outrun. AWESOME STEPHEN hugged the inner rail disputing the pace and weakened late. JUST PRAISE , four to five deep on the turn, weakened.

BUY THE BEST , in range between rivals leaving the five eighths, edged up under coaxing mid turn, moved up three wide and outside BENEATH THE
STARS in upper stretch, moved to a slim advantage in mid stretch, dueled and edged away late under a left handed drive. BENEATH THE STARS cleared
early, set a rated pace towards the inside, dug in when confronted in upper stretch, fought on past the sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly. MOODY
WOMAN settled off the pace while saving ground, advanced towards the rail mid turn, stayed inside through the drive but went evenly in the final furlong.
SOMMER VELVET , inside rivals pursuing past the five eighths, dropped back leaving the far turn then failed to generate a stretch kick. MY THOUGHTS ,
four wide outside rivals early on, had no response past the three eighths and faltered.

SHAKE EM LOOSE bore in leaving the starting gate, lacked speed, circled foes on the turn, was five deep entering the stretch, closed outside horses and
took the lead late. LAST ROMANCE advanced four deep on the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. LIFE IS GREAT bumped
with UNCLE BUDDY leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the turn, waited for room approaching the stretch, eased out to the three path in upper
stretch and rallied inside the top pair. RUN TO DAYLIGHT , well placed in the three path between horses on the turn, chased the pace in the stretch and
flattened out. UNCLE BUDDY bumped with LIFE IS GREAT leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail while disputing the pace and weakened through
the stretch. DONTCROSSFUZZY disputed the pace two wide and gave way entering the stretch. AMIDSHIPS , lightly bumped by the winner leaving the
starting gate, was outrun and floated very wide leaving the turn.

deep into the turn, dueled outside WHERE U B around the turn, held a slim lead past the three sixteenths, fought on between rivals leaving the eighth pole
then weakened. BOURBON AND ICE failed to menace. WHERE U B took over early and handled pressure, dueled inside DEGAS from the three eighths to
about mid stretch then weakened. LITTLE BOLD BANDIT vied to the inside of a rival early on and weakened. DEJOHN was not a factor. NATTY BEAU ,

KAYLASAURUS lacked speed, trailed turning for home, swung to the four path in upper stretch, closed determinedly outside horses and swept to command
about forty yards from the finish. PRINCESS KOKACHIN sprinted to the early lead, saved ground on the turn, drifted to the three path in upper stretch and
weakened late. PAISLEY SINGING saved ground on the turn and chased the pace through the stretch in a willing effort. DONTLETSWEETFOOLYA lacked
her usual speed, raced along the inner rail on the turn and weakened through the stretch. HELLO BEAUTIFUL , outside PRINCESS KOKACHIN on the turn,
chased that one to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
MISS LESLIE , four deep the first turn, stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn four wide, gained the lead outside ARTFUL
SPLATTER in upper stretch, was under brisk urging, drew out and switched to her left lead late. ARTFUL SPLATTER prompted the pace outside
SCATRATTLEANDROLL, gained a short lead mid way on the far turn, lost the lead in upper stretch, faded and held the place. KISS THE GIRL , well
positioned in the three path around both turns, had aim on the lead entering the stretch and flattened out. BELLE OF THE NORTH lacked speed, swung
very wide leaving the far turn, was in position to strike in upper stretch and lacked the necessary late response. VILLANELLE raced in the two path between
horses on the far turn and gradually weakened through the stretch. SCATRATTLEANDROLL rushed to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and
gave way turning for home. LOOKIN DYNAMIC , taken to the inner rail on the first turn, failed to be a factor. SMOOTH WITH A KICK , steadied and rank
behind the leader on the first turn, dropped back leaving the far turn.

Footnotes
CORDMAKER , patiently rated saving ground and within range, eased out advancing leaving the far turn, tracked the duel past the five sixteenths, moved
out to the four path into the lane, responded and closed in under a drive, forged clear with a furlong to go, widened then was taken in hand very late.
WORKIN ON A DREAM rushed up from the outside, prompted the pace two wide outside ALWAYSMINING, moved alongside then wrested command
around the far turn, was taken on soon after then headed by SHACKQUEENKING, sparred inside that on from the three eighths to upper stretch, gave way
grudgingly and earned the place. SHACKQUEENKING eased out mid way on the first turn and stalked the leaders under rating, moved up and bid three
wide leaving the far turn, dueled on a short lead past the five sixteenths, kept on past the furlong grounds then was out finished between foes. PLOT THE
DOTS , unhurried early off the rail, moved up five wide and outside the winner nearing the lane, drifted in past mid stretch and churned on. MCELMORE
AVENUE failed to menace. ALWAYSMINING rushed up between foes then dropped in to take the early lead, was pressured from his outside, ceded
command around the far turn and faltered.

TEQUILA FOG circled horses four deep on the turn, closed outside rivals and took the lead in deep stretch. RAN CHAR , two wide chasing the pace around
the turn, was floated out in upper stretch, had a late bid and just missed. MOVIE SCORE raced in the two path on the turn and had a willing finish inside
foes. JEANIE'S ANGEL sped to the early lead, saved ground setting the pace on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened late. GALLINELLA ,
five deep on the turn, failed to menace. JOYFUL NOISE lacked speed, hugged the inner rail on the turn and through the stretch but failed to rally. THEA'S
THEME stalked the pace, raced in the three path on the turn and gave way. CAROLINA ICE , outrun, swung very wide in upper stretch.
