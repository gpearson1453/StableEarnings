ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) sped to the early lead, set the pace off the rail, drifted out in mid stretch and prevailed under brisk urging. STRIKING A POSE ,
five deep on the first turn, raced between horses entering the far turn, hugged the inner rail entering the stretch, angled out inside the eighth pole, rallied and
raced on his left lead the final sixteenth of a mile. JACK GAVE BACK , four wide on both turns, failed to menace. GOLDIE'S BOY bore out leaving the
starting gate, chased the pace, was in the two path around the far turn and weakened inside foes. ERAWAN , caught in close quarters leaving the starting
gate, raced in the three path between horses on the far turn and lacked a rally. IRISHMAN hugged the inner rail and weakened on the far turn. KING ALAN
bobbled at the break, advanced five deep leaving the backstretch and gave way. ROCKIN RON , in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, steadied when
shuffled back approaching the backstretch.

Footnotes
MENDING prompted the pace three wide and in hand outside COMBAT QUEEN, moved to a slim lead past the three eighths, battled under strong handling
past the eighth pole then drew clear late. COMBAT QUEEN sped to the front, set the pace in about the two path while being pestered from her outside,
dueled from the three eighths to mid stretch, gave way grudgingly and just saved the place. AWFULLY FOXY broke a tad slow then edged up between
rivals in the opening furlong, was patiently handled four wide leaving the far turn, circled five wide into the lane, responded to asking and closed steadily.
BEHIND THE COUCH pulled her way forward to the inside of rivals in the opening stages, stalked inside around the turn, came out to about the four path
leaving the three sixteenths, moved up with AWFULLY FOXY to her outside but failed to match strides. OWEN'S PLEASURE , off the pace about two wide,
split runners in mid stretch, angled towards the inner rail and kept on trying. CHAYSENBRYN broke slowly, lagged back off the pace, raced four wide into
the stretch, swung out but failed to generate a solid kick. A GIRL NAMED JAC saved ground, was under pressure mid turn but lacked a rally.
MAUREENLOVESFRANK , four wide outside rivals while in range, was under pressure approaching the stretch, failed to kick on and faded. DEFY
EXPECTATIONS , keen between runners early, chased to the quarter pole and faltered.

lead, set the pace slightly off the inner rail and weakened late. SUNMAN circled the turn five deep and had a mild rally outside rivals. KEEPING THE
PEACE , steadied in traffic soon after the break, was in tight quarters along the inner rail leaving the backstretch, remained inside foes in the stretch and

Footnotes
CAN'T PASS IT UP settled off of a contested pace, moved up three wide into the lane, shifted in soon after, edged up behind the dueling leaders in mid
stretch, shifted out, rolled past those two wide under a drive then drew clear while steadily hand ridden the final yards. AIN'T DA BEER COLD dueled two to
three wide outside STONE COURAGEOUS, wrested a short lead into the lane, continued to battle past the furlong grounds and gave way grudgingly.
STONE COURAGEOUS got into a scrum to the inside of AIN'T DA BEER COLD leaving the chute, held a short lead around the turn, ceded command
approaching the stretch, stayed on to fight on past mid stretch, had his rider briefly misjudge the wire a sixteenth out then faded. ANTIPOISON tracked the
leaders while saving ground, eased out for the drive, pursued past the three sixteenths then came up empty. INK , off slowly when hopping, lagged well
back early on, swung wide into the stretch, altered back in through the final furlong and had some late life. JOHNNY SACK stalked the duel three wide and
outside a rival, spun four wide under pressure into the stretch, had no kick past the quarter pole and weakened. WHATCHASAID , under a snug hold while
in the clear and off the rail, circled four wide advancing past the three eighths, failed to kick on in upper stretch and faded. MAXIMUS MIDANI , sluggish
from the gate, saved ground while off the pace, was under asking mid turn, lacked a run and gave way.

Footnotes
LOST MY VOWCHER , rated down the backstretch, circled the turn four wide, secured command in upper stretch, opened up under urging mid stretch and
was not urged late when his rider appeared to misjudge the finish. AL BROWN , wide turning for home, brushed with MAID THE JOURNEY near the eighth
pole and rallied. MAID THE JOURNEY , fanned five wide entering the stretch, brushed with AL BROWN near the eighth pole and flattened out. BE
YOURSELF lacked speed, was taken very wide for the stretch run and passed tired horses. DAPER'S DRINK prompted the pace two wide around the turn
and weakened in the drive. BARDOLINO saved ground on the turn chasing the pace and gave way. IMTHEPRINCE , never a factor, passed tired foes.
PRINCE OF CAPS was not a factor. COX'S LEDGE raced in the three path on the turn and weakened. YOWZA YOWZA YOWZA , checked in traffic leaving
the backstretch, was no factor. SHOULDA HAD IT , steadied in close quarters along the inner rail leaving the backstretch, gave way. FORE ON SEVEN set
the pace along the inner rail and weakened. SIR LENNY refused to break.. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the start but no action was taken.

Footnotes
SUPER GARNER had an equipment adjustment pre race, was brushed at the break then quickly recovered and sped clear, set a rated pace off the inside,
responded when roused soon into the lane, widened a bit in mid stretch, kept on under right handed asking and held firm. KINGSTON PIKE drafted back
wide after an alert start, shifted in leaving the far turn and moved up in hand, waited briefly near the quarter pole, worked his way between runners leaving
the three sixteenths and kept on willingly to be along for the place. ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG) broke slowly, rushed up inside rivals soon after and
reached contention, gave hard chase three wide into the stretch and kept on trying to the wire. TOM TERRIFIC was rated back along the inside, swung very
wide for the drive and closed. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD chased inside rivals around the turn and gave way grudgingly. TOP BOSS , three to four wide
pursuing, came up empty. GETOFFMYBACK had an inside trip and failed to menace. MYSTIC TIMES circled five wide and faded. CONFUSION BABY
BOY chased well off the rail, circled six wide into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
SHEMADEMELUCKY , along the inner rail down the backstretch, eased off the rail on the turn, was taken to the four path in upper stretch, rallied outside
and took the lead late. MAGIC IN ME stalked the duel racing near the inner rail, eased outside leaving the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, finished
willingly but could not hold off the winner. SHE'S A TRIPP lacked speed, angled outside for the drive and passed tired horses. SHE'SRUNNINGHAPPY ,
four deep on the turn, drifted in near the eighth pole. SUMMER MUSIC , along the inner rail on the turn, was no factor. HEIDI T showed speed along the
inner rail, disputed the pace to the stretch and weakened. ZEALACIOUS , urged soon after the break, disputed the pace in the two path and tired. RUBI DE
LEON , three deep prompting the pace down the backstretch, gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
ALPHA CHI RHO , away alertly, attended the pace two wide outside VALUED NOTION, moved in hand and took over mid turn, was roused clear into the
lane, kicked away eagerly in mid stretch, continued on under a drive and finished with good energy. FORCED , away alertly, tracked the leaders three wide,
took closer order past the five sixteenths, saw the winner kick away in upper stretch but dug in and kept on well to save the place. WAIST DEEP drafted
back off the pace while saving ground, eased out nearing the lane, advanced between rivals in mid stretch, dropped inside to continued his run, pulled up
sore in the gallop out and was vanned off. HUNTER JOE lagged well back, raced three wide into the lane, swung further out in mid stretch and had belated
action. POWERFULLY BUILT stumbled at the break, recovered and was up with the leaders while saving some ground, eased out four wide while under
pressure in upper stretch but came up empty. ZIGGY MON , off last when stumbling badly, regrouped and was urged forwardly into the turn, came five wide
for the drive, moved up a bit in mid stretch then flattened out. VALUED NOTION was sent up to the inside of the winner and gained a short early lead, took
pressure into the turn, ceded command mid turn, stayed on to upper stretch then weakened.

Footnotes
RELATIVLEA brushed with BALTIMORE BULLEIT leaving the starting gate, was four deep on the turn, floated to the five path turning for home, gained the
lead near the eighth pole then drew off. JASONTAKESLONG saved ground around the turn, drifted to the four path entering the stretch, lost the lead in mid
stretch and weakened late. PAPA CHARLES , in the three path between horses on the turn, angled out and finished evenly. HOLIDAY AVENUE , steadied
in traffic near the five eighths pole, raced in the two path between horses on the turn and gradually weakened thereafter. BALTIMORE BULLEIT brushed
with the winner leaving the starting gate, floated six deep turning for home and lacked a rally. ICY MINISTER , unhurried down the backstretch, was not a
factor. EDENS GLORY prompted the pace outside JASONTAKESLONG around the turn and gave way. FULL OF MISCHIEF hugged the inner rail, chased
the pace and gave way.
