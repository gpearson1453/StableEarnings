Footnotes
NIMITZ was away alertly to vie for the lead early while three wide, then went on to set the pace and move down to the inside and was well handled, then
was headed by the quarter pole, shook clear leaving the turn then remained clear to prove best under a drive. DRAGON BALLET vied for the early lead
towards the inside, then was rated off the pace down the backstretch, made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command leaving the quarter pole, but
flattened out, second best. MONEY CODE chased the early pace three to four wide, then dropped down to the inside by the quarter pole and was along for
the show award. SUMMER ASH tracked the pace three wide and made a mild bid two wide on the turn and came up empty in the drive. MAJOR THOMAS
steadied after the start, then was settled back early, made a mild three wide bid on the turn and lacked a late rally. WISH FOR PEACE was settled on the
inside and tired. THATZA ALPHA chased the early pace and stopped.

Footnotes
POSSE CAN DISCO set the early pace while clear, then drew out in the drive to prove much the best under a drive. EXPENSIVE chased the winner three
wide and proved to be no match for that rival while clearly second best. GEM JUAN was allowed to settle early but lacked the needed stretch bid while
besting the rest. CHILLING SECRET was allowed to settle early while four wide, then was three wide by the quarter pole and had no rally. SCREEN STAR
was reserved early, then was blocked on the turn, then was two wide by the quarter pole and had no rally. WILL YA WIN SUM passed the tiring rivals.
HAPPY GUY was settled four to five wide on the turn and came up empty. COMMUNICATION FAIL broke in the air at the start, made a five wide middle
move and tired. METHODTOTHEMADNESS failed to menace. DREAMING THOUSAND chased the pace on the inside and stopped.

BRODIX was away alertly to set the early paced while clear, then turned back a bid leaving the quarter pole, then drew out by the furlong marker, drifted out
slightly by the sixteenths pole but was corrected and remained clear to prove much the best. SACHMO was reserved early, split rivals by the quarter pole,
then finished willingly towards the inside to gain the place award. DEB'S GUNFIGHTER was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the drive and had a
belated rally. SPOOKY ONE was settled early, made a four wide bid on the turn but came up empty in the drive. HE'SAREARVIEWTOWN stalked the early
pace and weakened. BEST AND FINAL had no response.

furlong marker, then held gamely to prove best under a drive. SECRET BANKER prompted the early pace and made a three wide bid to vie for command by
the quarter pole, then did not corner well leaving the turn carrying MOONSAFE out leaving the turn, then shifted in to have a long drive with SEEKING THE

was floated out six wide leaving the turn and came up empty. AFTER THE PARTY set a pressured pace two wide and weakened. MAJESTIC GREELEY

sixteenths and kicked clear to prove best. GIMME'S GOLDENGIRL was rated early while three to four wide, made a three wide bid on the far turn to vie for
command by the five sixteenths, then dueled with the winner leaving the turn but proved to be no match late for that rival, second best. TOTALLY PERFECT
was allowed to settle early on the inside, then was shuffled back to trail the field, then split rivals by the quarter pole, angled out by the three sixteenths and
was up for the show award. LIAM'S LADY was well placed early on the inside, then was two wide by the quarter pole and had no punch in the drive.

Footnotes
RAPIDASHQUEEN after not breaking sharp, moved up the inside into the first turn, then was rated off the pace setters and moved to the three to four path,
made a three wide bid in hand on the turn, took over by the quarter pole and drew off in the stretch under a hand ride and was wrapped up late while
proving much the best. EXPURGATED was allowed to settle early, then advanced three wide on the turn to move into contention, then proved to be no
match to the winner while second best. ARCTICA was settled back early and lacked a rally while being along for the show award. HARD CHANT after not
cornering well into the first turn, set a pressured pace while racing off the inside, then shook clear on the backstretch, was headed on the turn and
weakened. SEEKING THE THRONE was five wide into the first turn, then was allowed to settle early and had no response. OUR WEST INDY pressed the
pace three wide and tired. FAVORITE DOLL was four wide into the first turn, then went bad and had to be pulled up around the three eighths pole, vanned
off.

AWESOME YET AGAIN vied for the early lead three wide, made a bid on the turn and drew clear, then drew off to prove much the best under left handed
crop urging. E T'S SUPER STAR was settled back early, then finished well on the inside to get the place award. HOUSE IMPEACHMENT had to check on
the turn, then moved to the outside and came six wide into the drive and was along for the show. VOODOO CAT tracked the early pace three wide and
weakened. FLAT BUSTED vied for the lead on the inside of the winner early, then moved out three wide on the turn and weakened. TASTY'S BULLSEYE
was settled early while five wide on the turn and had no rally. TOUCH OF PRINCE chased the early pace on the inside and weakened. CROSSING
VERAZANNO checked around the seven sixteenths and was not a threat. WAR LANCER was bumped at the start, failed to menace. DIALED IN GOLD was
not a factor while four to five wide.
