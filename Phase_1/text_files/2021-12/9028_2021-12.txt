Footnotes
PIPER ROSE raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths marker and was up in the closing
yards. UNCHAINING MELODY (GB) was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a quarter to
run, opened a clear margin in mid-stretch but could not resist the winner late. KISSABLE U broke sharply to stalk the leaders while racing three-wide, moved
up in tandem with UNCHAINING MELODY (GB) to offer a bid nearing the quarter and gave way through the final furlong. MISS KITNESS sprinted clear at
once, saved ground while setting the pace and weakened after going six furlongs. GREATER GLORY was off slow, raced three-wide through the second
turn and did not reach contention. INTOXICATING KISS was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DON'TTEASETHETIGER broke sharply to duel for the early advantage while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin after going three furlongs, was well
rated into the lane and held BROTHER ROBERT safely to the wire. BROTHER ROBERT was away in good order to chase the winner while racing
five-wide, could reach that rival in the drive but finished well to be clearly second best. CHECK AND RAISE lacked early foot, saved ground through the
second turn, reached a contending position and finished evenly late. SWAMP SOUFFLE was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second
turn and lacked the needed late response. AERO STREET lagged early, raced six-wide through the second turn and failed to menace. OLYMPIC
EXPRESS was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. PLEASE DO TELL showed brief speed, raced four-wide
through the second turn and weakened.

Footnotes
FISHIN THE RIVER sprinted clear at once, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off through the lane with complete authority. TAMARANDO'S
MINE tracked the winner from the inside throughout, was no match for that rival in the drive but finished well to hold the place. WHISPERING FLAME settled
off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out nearing the quarter and finished evenly late. COWBABY was void of early speed,
raced seven-wide through the second turn and failed to menace. JAZZ STORY lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn, reached a
contending position but lacked the needed closing response. TONOFSUMMERFUN showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and
was not a factor. MY NAME IS SUE chased the leaders while racing three-wide for a half and weakened. THE RIDER OF TAMARANDO'S MINE LODGED
AN OBJECTION AGAINST FISHIN THE RIVER AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

be kept to task. MANCUSO AT THE MIC lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. FREESTONE settled off the
leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. FIGHT ME was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn, raced in
tight quarters in mid-stretch and finished evenly late. LITIGATOR was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the
drive. CAPPER showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. BIG TONY disputed the pace from the inside and

Footnotes
REELFOOT lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and edged away late. SAVED BY ZERO was away in
good order to set a pressured pace while racing four-wide, drifted out nearing the quarter and gave way grudgingly to the winner late. J SERINO chased the
leaders while racing three-wide and gave way late. MR VIEW settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid.
FAIR CHALLENGE was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly. WASJUANNOWPAUL showed no early speed,
raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. JAQUET chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. COUNTRY
ROAD settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. VALLEY WILDCAT was void of early speed, raced five-wide through
the turn and was not a factor.
