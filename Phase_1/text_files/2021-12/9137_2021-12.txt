Footnotes
PELUCHIN CHIN, forwardly placed while shifting outside the pacesetter racing through the backstretch, moved to challenge that rival nearing upper stretch,
wrested the advantage entering the lane, shifted inwards under pressure but went clear under pressure. RUNNING VIOLENCE switched out in early stages
to track the leaders in the three path between foes racing into the turn, then continued with a steady effort in that path to edge a rival for the place honors in
time. FIFTY CENTS broke sharply, angled inwards dictating the pace on a comfortable margin through the backstretch, dueled inside the winner into upper
stretch and weakened leaving the furlong marlker. THE BEAST GOES ON settled inside foes in the last flight racing to the turn, saved ground to upper
stretch, then shifted four wide in the closing stages continuing with interest to gain some position. MIAMI CHROME worked his way to the inside in early
stages to gain a position inside foes in second flight, saved ground through the turn, tipped out in late stages but had no closing bid. DUTCHMEN
FOREVER settled outside foes in the last flight in the opening stages, shifted inwards racing through the turn while being prompted to advance but proved
no threat. DENY switched out to the four path in the opening quarter tracking just off the leaders to the turn and steadily faded into upper stretch. THE WILD
FLYER proved no factor. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF FIFTY CENTS LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
PROBABLY GRACE, in touch with the leaders three deep attending the pace on her own courage racing through the backstretch, responded when given
her cue to press the issue leaving the midway point of the bend, took over racing into upper stretch and went clear under firm right handed encouragement.
U KNOW I B LION, urged along the inside to gain the advantage after the opening sixteenth, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the turn, dueled inside
rivals into upper stretch, couldn't match terms with the winner late but held grudgingly for second. ORNERY ANGEL bobbled at the start, angled inwards
tracking off the first flight racing into the turn, tipped out three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest while missing for second. KENAI
COOL, held up avoiding close quarters in the opening stages, dropped out last near the inside racing to the turn, switched off the inside gathering
momentum to race four wide through the stretch and continued with a mild bid. TALE OF V K tracked just off the first flight racing four wide through the
backstretch to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. HAPPY LOUDON, urged between foes prompting the pace, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
SANCOCHO (MEX) was prompted to terms with the leaders inside foes racing past the chute, was eased off the pace after the opening furlong to track just
off the leaders along the inside, angled out racing into the turn while being prompted to regain position, shifted to the four path nearing upper stretch while
being urged to advance on the leaders, then continued with a steady late response to wrest a clear advantage in the closing stages under hand urging.
CLIFFY switched off the inside in early stages tracking off the first flight, continued three deep into the turn, angled inwards racing into upper stretch to split
rivals just off the inside leaving the furlong marker and prevailed for the place honors while failing to match the winner's kick. KRAMDEN settled between
foes in the last flight racing to the turn, angled out five wide racing into upper stretch and found his best stride late to gain a share while missing for second.
LAUDERDALE settled inside foes, shifted to the rail racing through the backstretch, saved ground through the turn to upper stretch gaining some position
but had no final kick. STRIKING HEIR, urged three wide between foes prompting the pace in early stages, shifted to the inside dueling for command racing
into the turn, continued a bit off the rail to upper stretch and gave way late while finishing on even terms with his INDY RIDE. INDY RIDE joined the pace
four wide in the opening stages, forced the issue outside a rival racing into the turn to upper stretch but gave way in the drive while finishing on even terms
with STRIKING HEIR. TEAM EFFORT, urged between, then inside foes prompting the pace in the opening three furlongs, gave way racing into the turn.
THE GREAT LOUDINI settled outside foes in the last flight on the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter.

Footnotes
R TENDERONI came through close quarters in the opening stages to gain terms with the leaders while angling to the inside, raced just behind the
pacesetter along the rail into the turn, tipped outside that foe racing into upper stretch and produced a steady late response to wrest the advantage and go
clear under firm handling. SHES ASTYLISH KATZ was urged to gain the lead while angling inwards in the opening furlong, dictated the pace just off the rail
racing into the turn, held sway along the inside to upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. MARIMBA, off slowly, was settled into
stride dropping well off the leaders, switched outside foes gathering momentum racing into the turn, swung out four wide in upper stretch and continued well
enough to gain a share. LADY PAYNTER tracked off the second flight inside foes, saved ground to upper stretch and came up empty in the drive. WATER
WIZARD was prompted to a forward placing outside the pacesetter, continued three deep in second flight racing to the turn and steadily faded into upper
stretch. PROMINENT HENNY, bumped at the start, was righted, then urged between foes prompting the pacesetter racing into the turn and gave way into
the lane. ANOTHER SAUCY SIX, caught in close quarters, then checked off rivals racing through the chute, dropped out of contention early. DARRINS
DARLING ducked inwards at the start bumping PROMINENT HENNY, tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening quarter but faded early.

Footnotes
SKIPPERINI gained a forward placing along the rail racing just inside the leaders to the bend, advanced along the rail to press the issue entering the turn,
shifted off the inside entering upper stretch once gaining a clear advantage and widened the margin under firm right handed pressure. SHINBORO was
urged disputing the pace from the outset racing a bit off the rail, dueled between foes racing through the turn, couldn't match terms with the winner but held
grudgingly for second. MY WAY OR NO WAY, bumped from both sides in the opening stages dropping off the second flight, was prompted to split foes
nearing upper stretch, angled four wide entering the lane and continued with a steady late bid while just missing for second. CAPTURED DREAMS was
urged prompting the pace outside a rival in the opening quarter, dueled for command three deep between foes through the turn to upper stretch and
weakened late. AIDINGANDABETTING tracked just off the first flight outside rivals in the opening stages, continued in pursuit of those foes four wide to
upper stretch and gave way. BUBBA DREAMS shifted out bumping MY WAY OR NO WAY in early stages, settled well off the leaders, then passed some
tiring rivals racing into the lane. STAR ON THE MAP tracked the leaders from out of striking distance three wide to the turn, drifted out nearing the lane and
quickly gave way. OXBOW KID tracked off the first flight along the inside in the opening half and faded into upper stretch. NOICATTARO exchanged bumps
with MY WAY OR NO WAY in the opening stages and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
PROMISE ME broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the far turn, shook clear racing into upper stretch and maintained a
safe advantage under firm encouragement. TWELVE RED ROSES was rated off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, was prompted to
advance three wide into the far turn and continued with interest in that path to prove best of the others. SPARKLING PLENTY angled to the inside in early
stages tracking just off the pacesetter, saved ground through the far turn to the lane and continued well enough to prevail for a share.
CECI'SAPRILHOTTIE, off slowly, was reserved near the inside to the backstretch, switched outside foes while being prompted to advance, then split foes
three deep in the closing stages while steadily improving position. FAST FASHION, in touch with the pacesetter three wide in early stages, shifted inwards
after a half to press that rival into the second bend but gave way into upper stretch. TAP SOLO tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch,
angled out four wide nearing the lane while being prompted to advance but lacked the needed final kick. LEFT OF CENTER settled along the inside racing
to the backstretch, shifted outside foes racing into upper stretch gaining some position but made no real impression. SYLLABUS, caught three, then four
wide racing to the backstretch, made some brief progress outside foes to gain a position just off the second flight but emptied out racing through the far turn.
TIZ LOTTIE, bumped at the start, was urged between foes prompting the pacesetter to the backstretch but was spent early. C'EST PARTI, reserved inside
foes behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, steadily faded after a half.

Footnotes
MARICOPA was settled between foes out of striking distance racing to the turn, angled out five wide in upper stretch, then rallied to the front in time under
brisk handling. FIRST GOLD, in touch with the first flight between foes prompting the pace, took over nearing midstretch but just failed to contain the winner.
GONE DREAMING angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing into the turn, shifted out three wide in upper stretch to challenge but was outkicked
by the top pair. AUBURN tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn, angled inwards in the drive but had no kick. OB LA DI was reserved off
the second flight near the inside racing to the turn, switched out in late stages and continued evenly. AUDREY settled near the inside early, saved ground to
upper stretch and passed inside some tiring rivals. CHARGING RENEE, in touch with the leaders four wide prompting the pace, faded into upper stretch.
NAVAL WAVE angled to the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing through the backstretch, dueled inside foes on the turn to upper stretch
and gave way in late stages. PALIO SIENA, in touch with the first flight three wide between foes prompting the pace into the turn, gave way into upper
stretch. RACHEL'S WISH proved no factor. TAP TAP BIRDIE was under pressure early between foes tracking off the second flight and emptied out after a
half.

Footnotes
BENS MALICE, reserved while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, gathered some momentum inside foes entering the second bend, shifted out
six wide racing into upper stretch and produced a stout rally to wrest the advantage in time under firm handling. BARBERINI angled inwards in the opening
stages while being rated between foes just behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, split foes racing through the stretch advancing to challenge,
gained the advantage between calls late but was outkicked. STRIDE tracked the leaders three wide in second flight in the opening half, advanced four wide
leaving the far turn, was fanned five wide racing past midstretch but continued with a mild bid while outkicked by the top pair. HIGH STOCK sped to the lead
along the rail, dictated the pace to the far turn, turned back a rival's challenge to regain a clear advantage racing past midstretch but gave out in late stages.
THE GREEN CRUSADER tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight in the opening half, advanced to contention along the rail racing into the lane, then
shifted outside a tiring foe in the closing stages but had no final kick. CHAOTIC TEMPO, urged pursuing the pacesetter in the three path racing to the
backstretch, moved to briefly close the gap on that foe on the far turn but quickly flattened out. FIERCE WARRIOR settled last to the far turn, switched out
racing into the stretch and passed some tiring rivals. OPTIGOGO, urged between foes tracking off the first flight in the opening half, was urged to make a
brief advance three wide on the far turn but came up empty in upper stretch. KISS PRINCIPAL settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and never
seriously menaced. SHIMMERING LEROID tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch and retreated early.

Footnotes
ZERENIA, reserved well off the leaders along the inside racing to the backstretch, gained some position inside foes nearing the second bend, angled out
four wide nearing the lane advancing on the leaders, then rallied to the front and went clear under firm encouragement. TOWERING GAZE broke inwards
bumping INDEPENDENCE LAW, was righted to track off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, tipped out racing into the far turn to advance
on the leaders three wide, bid between foes midstretch but proved only second best. MUSETTA settled between foes in the last flight racing to the
backstretch, angled inside on the far turn gaining some position, then switched out four wide racing through the stretch to prevail for a share in time.
INDEPENDENCE LAW, bumped at the start, was urged to dictate the pace along the inside on a narrow advantage, held sway to midstretch but gave out
once challenged by the top pair. BEAUTY GENIUS was rated between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide nearing the lane
but offered no rally. GLITTER BAY, forwardly placed stalking just outside the pacesetter racing to the far turn, shifted inwards under pressure and emptied
out in the drive. GREEN GAL angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight to the far turn and faded into upper stretch.
WHISPERING WANDA settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and proved no threat. TWISTED TREASURE tracked off the leaders four wide, then
three wide to the backstretch and faded after a half. LA BRODY, caught four wide racing into the first turn, retreated early.
