Footnotes
GRAY ADMIRAL was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and drew off through the lane
as a handy winner. CANDY WOMPUS was reserved just off the leaders early, advanced five-wide through the second turn and was up for the place.
CHRISTINE'S JACK pressed the pace while racing three-wide, was no match for the winner in the drive and gave way after going three-quarters. POPPY'S
C NOTE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. CHIEFTAIN'S LAD was void of early foot, raced
three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE lagged early, saved ground through the second turn and failed to
threaten.

Footnotes
GALILETA sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and held sway to the wire. SILLY NOTION was reserved just off the leaders early,
angled out into the stretch, could not reach the winner but finished with a steady bid. APRILINTHEPINES was away in good order to track the leaders from
the inside, angled out nearing the quarter and failed to gain late. SHES GOT THE POWER chased the leaders while racing three-wide throughout and
lacked the needed closing response. WISHFUL WON was taken back at the break, angled out into the stretch and was not a factor. AQUINAS lacked early
speed, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten. EBB AND FLOW was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened.
DUE TO MALFUNCTION THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

MULLIGAN broke sharply to press the pace of CHARMANT E while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter and held GET'EM
TIGER safe late. GET'EM TIGER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished
with a steady rally. CHARMANT E set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. LE TUB lacked early foot, raced five-wide
through the turn and finished evenly. SUNDANCE STAR broke in the air, lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to menace. MISCHIEF
MAMA was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MICKEY DOBBS was away in good order to chase the leaders
while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs.

Footnotes
WINTER STAR lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew
off. SPICY SOMMELIER sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch and yielded to the winner late.
EARLYNTHEMORN chased the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the five-sixteenths marker and finished willingly. PRINCESS SOIREE chased
the leaders while racing three-wide throughout and lacked the needed late response. CHICKS DIG MUNNY was void of early speed, raced three-wide
through the second turn and finished evenly late. LOVE ON THE FLY was forwardly placed from the inside and gradually weakened. GOLDEN GODDESS
settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and weakened. ALLEYESFOLLOWBELLE showed brief speed and weakened.
UNUSUAL SECRET lagged throughout. THE TIMER MALFUNCTIONED AND THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
