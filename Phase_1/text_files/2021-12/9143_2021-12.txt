Footnotes
CITY PARK tracked two wide, gained three wide around the far turn to bid for the lead passing the quarter pole, then drew off at the furlong grounds, and
held from a rallying RUN ROCKET late. RUN ROCKET trailed two wide, shifted from the three to the four path entering the lane, then rallied through the
final furlong while on his left lead, attempted a late bid, but was kept at bay. I'M D'CAT settled off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn three wide,
then chased from behind the leaders through the lane, and caught the tiring early pace setter for show late. CUSTOM BOBBY'S shifted outwardly through
the late for the first time to discourage an outer foe from vying, set the pace along the inside, inched clear into the far turn, met CITY PARK's bid entering
the lane, but was headed in upper stretch, and gave way through the final furlong. LOUISIANA MOON laid off of the pace three to four wide around the
turns, got floated five wide in upper stretch, and failed to factor. BAYOU JAM tracked along the inside while saving ground, but was outmoved by an outer
rival turning for home, and faded through the lane. IN CHARGE HALO stalked the leader from the outside but weakened between horses around the far
turn.

inside of a pressing EILEEN ALEXANDRA, met FORT POLK's bid into the far turn, got headed at the three furlong marker, but fought on thereafter,
sustained pressing position through upper stretch, but failed to keep pace with his outer counterpart passing the furlong grounds. NET A BEAR trailed three
wide, improved in upper stretch, and stayed on chase the top pair home. EILEEN ALEXANDRA pressed the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace between
horses at the three furlong pole, and faded. QUIKFAST N AHURRY stalked along the inside, chased the leaders around the far turn, but faded through the

Footnotes
SPELLBINDING stalked two to three wide, ranged up to the clear leader entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, led at the three sixteenths pole, and drew off
thereafter. G'S DEADLINE was pinched back from tight quarters between horses early on, settled far back in the three path, shifted three to five wide
entering the lane, and rallied outside of foes through the final furlong to reach place. SAVVY SHIPMAN rated off of the pace along the inside, then two wide
around the far turn, shifted back to the rail in upper stretch to mount a rally, gained inside of foes through the final furlong, but missed reaching place.
CRIMSON FELINE tracked from midpack two wide, then four wide around the far turn while following SPELLBINDING's bid, but only managed to chase that
foe through the lane, bid for place approaching the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by rivals on both sides. SPIDER LEGS set the pace two wide around
the first turn before clearing an inner foe into the backstretch, inched clear of a pressing foe into the far turn, but met a challenge in upper stretch, got
headed at the three sixteenths pole, then weakened between horses a sixteenth from home. DUEPEG laid off of the pace three wide, shifted to the six path
and outside of foes in the final furlong, and moved up. TOP TEN DUCHESS tracked along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, tipped four wide in
upper stretch, but lacked a rally. DISTRACTOR FACTOR pressed the pace setter three to two wide, but failed to keep pace into the far turn, then further
faded in upper stretch. VITA trailed along the inside, and was outrun. THEBOYZGALAXY pressed along the inside around the first turn, relaxed to stalk the
pace into the backstretch, but faded into the far turn.

Footnotes
OVA CHARGED was last away without incident, tracked two wide into the turn while under steady urging, shifted outside of the leading trio turning for home,
claimed place approaching the furlong pole while taking aim on a clear CILLA, ranged up to that foe in the final sixteenth, and forged an advantage late.
CILLA stalked two wide, bid between horses at the five sixteenths pole, led entering the lane, drew clear passing the three sixteenths pole, but was worn
down by an outer foe approaching the wire. STRONG BEAUTY chased along the inside, shifted two wide entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with top
two approaching the furlong grounds, and stayed on to reach show inside of a rival passing the sixteenth pole. SARAH'S PASSION chased three wide, bid
for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, vied outside of CILLA entering the lane, but weakened between horses passing the three sixteenths marker.
SNOWBALL laid at the rear along the inside, shifted tow wide turning for home, then to the five path approaching midstretch, but lacked a rally. SIENNA
BREEZE settled at the rear three wide, came into the lane in the five path, and never got involved. SUMITUP sped clear early on, but met a pair of bid at the
five sixteenths pole, and weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
GRAND LUWEGEE set a clear pace while shifting down to the two path around the first turn, irrelevantly brushed the inner railing down the backstretch,
relaxed into the far turn as foes drew closer, but maintained a margin entering the lane, widened that advantage in upper stretch as HIGHLAND CREEK
gave chase, and held sway on his left lead. HIGHLAND CREEK tucked into the first turn to save ground while tracking the pace, stalked around the far turn
before tipping outside of the leader entering the lane, but lacked a kick to produce a bid, and only managed to chase the leader home while proving second
best. POUND FOR POUND almost rushed the gate when the rider flagged just before the start, stalked the clear leader from the outside, pressed that foe
around the far turn, but faded while getting floated three wide entering the lane, then briefly drifted outwardly in upper stretch, but managed show. JIMI'S A
STAR laid off of the pace in the tow path around the first turn, advanced to track the leader three wide around the far turn, but got floated four wide entering
the lane, drifted outwardly as an inner foe did the same in upper stretch, and flattened out without bidding. SECRET VISTA settled far back two wide,
chased four wide around the far turn, but tired entering the lane. MAGEEZ trailed after being slow into stride, and never got involved. UNRESTRICTED
tracked from midpack in the three path around the first turn, but was done after a half mile.

UNIFIED REPORT tracked two wide and between horses, began to progress while shifting four wide turning for home, ranged up outside of the leaders
approaching midstretch, sparked a duel with CHARCO at the furlong grounds, edged a narrow advantage passing the sixteenth pole as BRON AND BROW
menaced outside, but fended that foe off to the wire. BRON AND BROW broke towards the back of the pack, settled off of the pace along the inside, but
steadied when running up on horses' heels at the half mile pole, saved ground around the bend before tipping three wide entering the lane, awaited racing
room behind UNIFIED REPORT passing the quarter pole, shifted six wide and outside of that foe at the three sixteenths, then rallied to take aim on that
bidding rival in the final sixteenth, produced a late bid, but was turned away. CHARCO dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, disposed of his
inner counterpart at the three sixteenths pole to inch a clear margin, but dug in at the furlong grounds as UNIFIED REPORT bid, battled inside of that foe
into the final sixteenth, but yielded late. VODKA GIMLET lost position when taken up from a bit of crowded quarters soon after the start, saved ground while
trailing around the turn, shifted three wide in upper stretch, surpassed inner foes before diving back to the rail for clear sailing passing the furlong pole, but
only managed to chase outer foes home. FIESTY FIST prompted the pace three wide, chase between horses in upper stretch, then faded on his left lead at
the furlong grounds. TAMBOURINE STAR stalked along the inside, failed to split the leaders at the quarter pole before dedicating to a rail charge shortly
after, but lacked a kick, and tired. GOTMY MO JO WORKIN laid off of the pace three wide, and failed to factor. TRUE DEAL stalked four wide, but faded
after being floated five wide at the five sixteenths pole. GRUNT dueled for the lead along the inside, but caved at the three sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
MONTE MAN stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leading trio entering the lane, rallied to claim place at the furlong grounds, took aim on a clear
BERTIE'S GALAXY shortly after, ranged up to his stablemate with a sixteenth to go, and drove past. BERTIE'S GALAXY dueled for the lead inside of a pair
of vying rivals, shook clear of those foes entering the lane, drew off through upper stretch, but was challenged in earnest by MONTE MAN entering the final
sixteenth, and was worn down late. SIR WELLINGTON tracked the pace two wide and between horses, but got floated five wide by his inner counterpart
entering the lane, failed to match rallying strides with that foe in upper stretch, but kept on, bid for show at the sixteenth pole, dueled outside of HAIL STATE
for that position, and prevailed. HAIL STATE saved ground off of the pace, shifted two wide in midstretch to surpass a tiring rival, stayed on to complete a
bid for show inside of foes at the sixteenth pole, battled inside of SIR WELLINGTON thereafter, but missed that position. TAKES TWO TO TANGO vied
three wide through swift fractions, but failed to keep pace with his innermost counterpart passing the quarter pole, then tired between horses in midstretch.
SWOT ANALYSIS dueled for the lead two wide and between horse, but faded entering the lane. IZZY'S BABY BOY got caught five wide around the turn
while off of the pace, shifted seven wide entering the lane, and failed to factor. PICKENS broke outwardly and brushed a foe, chased three wide while in
midpack, but was tentative to improve inside of a stopping NO PAROLE at the seven sixteenths pole, got shuffled back and steadied into the turn, then
swung six wide in upper stretch, and lacked a rally. FATHER GOOSE never got involved. NO PAROLE chased four wide early on, but failed to keep pace at
the half mile pole, wilted between horses into the turn, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
WHO TOOK THE MONEY settled far off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path around the far turn, swung six wide at the three-sixteenths,
produced a strong kick in midstretch, blew past inner foes approaching the final sixteenth while the rider dropped his stick, and surged clear. BUDRO
TALKING rated far off of the pace two wide, shifted five wide entering the lane, grinded away in pursuit of the leaders through midstretch, but was outkicked
approaching the final sixteenth, and kept on to claim place. TREYS MIDNITE MOON bumped the gate, then rated back from tight quarters early on to trail
the field, shifted five wide approaching midstretch, and rallied to reach show. MANGELSEN set a pressured pace down the backstretch, inherited a wide
advantage after his prompting rival tired into the far turn, held sway from chasing foes through upper stretch, but offered little resistance to an outer foe at
the sixteenth pole, then was nailed for show on the wire. JACI'S ROYALTY saved ground in midpack, but lacked a rail rally. CARLEA'S DREAM stalked
along the inside, drifted three wide in upper stretch, chased on his left lead into the final furlong, but was outkicked and faltered. IM A COWBOY TOO
stalked two to three wide, shifted four wide in upper stretch, but only managed to chase, got outkicked passing the furlong grounds, and flattened. BRITTS A
CLOSER settled off of the pace, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. MR. FOUR SEVENS pressed the pace setter from the outside,
but weakened into the far turn. JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT laid off of the pace along the inside, but was done early.

Footnotes
BUCKLEY BUNNY settled far off of the pace, gained mildly four wide around the turn, shifted five wide entering the lane, grinded away outside of foes to bid
passing the furlong pole, forged an advantage at the sixteenth pole, and edged away. FREE LIKE A GIRL stalked along the inside, bumped an outer foe
while shifting three wide entering the lane, but lacked a kick between horses through a large opening, got outkicked by an outer rival passing the furlong
grounds, kept on to reach place in the final sixteenth, and held that position. MEDLEY broke a tad slowly, laid far off of the pace two wide, gained between
horses through upper stretch, tipped outside of the leading group approaching the final sixteenth, and rallied, but just missed reaching place. BELEOUT set
the pace along the inside, met a trio of bids entering the lane, clung to a narrow margin through midstretch, but was bested a sixteenth from home, gave
way, lost place late, and was nailed for show. WON DAY stalked four wide, ranged up entering the lane, vied through upper stretch, but was outkicked at the
furlong grounds, and faltered late. BASALT STREET pressed the pace two wide and between horses, bid turning for home, vied among rivals through upper
stretch, but faltered through the final sixteenth. DREAMING OF NEANY laid off of the pace to wide and between horses, but only managed to chase through
the lane, and failed to menace. WHOLELOTTAMO laid off of the pace along the inside, but faded at the three furlong pole. VALTESSE was off slowly and
trailed the field, came into the lane five wide, and passed tired foes. DREAM ON IT stalked three wide and between horses, but weakened after taking a
bump from an inner foe passing the quarter pole. MAESTRIA lunged outwardly and bobbled at the start, laid off of the pace three wide, but tired turning for
home.

Footnotes
BIG CHOPPER set the pace along the inside, shifted outwardly at the furlong grounds to meet ORDER UP's bid, and gamely held to the wire. ORDER UP
pressed two wide, bid for the lead in midstretch under a long drive, but was fended off by the leader. HELAIRE raced off of the pace two wide, shifted four
wide in upper stretch, and stayed on to reach show late. GUTZY tucked into the turn to stalk along the inside, but only managed to chase the leading pair
into the final furlong before fading. GUITARTUITION PLZZ was reluctant to load, then stumbled at the start, laid far off of the pace, swung to the five path
entering the lane, and moved up mildly. CALLEN FEELS GOOD chased along the inside, but tired through the lane. JOHNNY BOOTLEGGS broke inwardly
and slowly, saved ground off of the pace around the turn, but to no avail. GENERAL EISENHOWER was outrun. MORE HARDER showed little.
