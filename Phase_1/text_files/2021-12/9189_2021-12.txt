Footnotes
MONGOLIAN ROSE pressed the pace of MISS REBEKAH while racing three-wide, moved up to gain command with a furlong to run and quickly drew off.
MISS REBEKAH was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, yielded to the winner through the final furlong but finished well to hold the
place. LOW DOSE was fractious during the post parade, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and
finished with some late run. QUEENS RANSOM chased the leaders from off the rail throughout and lacked the needed closing response. KNOCKON lacked
early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. BUBBAS STREET GAL showed brief speed from the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
ABI GEZUNT sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace, increased his advantage into the lane and was ridden out to be
kept to task. FLYING CHARLIE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. GONE
SOMEWHERE chased the leaders while racing three-wide, angled out further into the stretch and finished evenly late. THE THIRD RING settled off the
leaders early, saved ground through the turn and failed to rally. GOOD BOY ROY chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a
half. INDIAN NIGHTS showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and did not menace.

Footnotes
LAUGHAROO sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and held sway to the wire. FICTIONAL broke sharply to chase the winner while
racing three-wide throughout, could not reach that rival in the drive but finished with a steady bid. MONGOLIAN WINDOW was reserved just off the leaders
early, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late response. BONITA RAPIDS was pinched back at the start, raced unhurried early,
moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly. SWEET RYAN settled off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn and failed to rally. HOT
AND SASSY was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

GOLDEN TIGER dueled for the lead from between foes, responded when set down for the drive and held gamely to the wire. CHRISTINE'S JACK disputed
the pace while racing three-wide, vied with the winner into deep stretch but could not get by that rival in the drive. PARLEY STREET settled off the leaders
early, moved between rivals through the turn and finished with some late run. DEVIL'S TEETH raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through
the turn and finished evenly late. LICORICE DROP POPS showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and failed
to menace. MR VIEW was void of early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. EIGHT SPOKES raced off the leaders from the inside
and gradually weakened. SAVED BY ZERO was away in good order to dispute the pace from between foes, moved five-wide through the turn and
weakened.

Footnotes
BROTHER ROBERT was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, vied into deep stretch and edged clear late. WAKE UP CALL
disputed the pace from between foes, vied with the winner into late lane but could not match strides. CAUSE AND EFFECT settled off the leaders early,
moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a steady rally. UNION BROTHER vied for the lead from the inside,
checked late and gave way. BLOW MY MIND lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. REDACTION showed no
early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and did not menace. LOVER BOY BOB raced off the pacesetters
early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. REELFOOT was void of early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ATTA
BOY BILLY was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened. FREEZING JIMMY raced off the leaders early, moved five-wide
through the turn and weakened.
