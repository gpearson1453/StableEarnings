Footnotes
TAMANRASSETT chased the pace into the stretch, split horses two then three wide and was along in time. PRETTY STORMY pressed the pace, loomed
boldly two wide nearing the top of the stretch, battled the balance of the trip and finished second best. THECHROMEWEKNOW allowed to settle, closed fast
two wide then along the inside through the stretch, ran up on heels just past the sixteenth pole causing his rider to check and finished with good courage.
BOB'S CALLING chased the pace three and four wide and went evenly. INTENTIONAL WALK made the lead soon after the start, set the pace along the
inside until deep stretch then weakened. CAT'S CURIOSITY close up along the inside, failed to respond. THE DRAKE was outrun. STRETCH RUNNER
was no threat.

CAT'S RHYTHM always within striking distance inside, rallied determinedly along the rail through the stretch and was along in time. OPULENT prompted
the pace two wide into the turn, put a head in front, drifted to the five path, battled for the lead until deep stretch and finished second best. STAR MABEE
never far back, loomed boldly three wide into the stretch and finished determinedly. CHECK OUT LINE passed tiring rivals. ADVENTURE LAND sprinted to
the lead soon after the start, set the pace into the turn, matched strides in the two path until deep stretch then weakened. DRUMBEG with the second flight
three wide, drifted to the six path entering the stretch and gave way late.

the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner. ROSA'S SOUL never far back, loomed boldly along the
rail into the stretch then was outfinished. TREASURED NIKKY pressed the pace four then two wide into the turn, drew on even terms for the lead, battled
until deep stretch and was outfinished three wide. DALIDA with the second flight three wide, went evenly. NELL'S BELLS trailed early, swung wide and
closed some ground late past mid track. LITTLE EMPIRE was fractious in the gate then no factor. POOLSIDE COCKTAILS had speed along the inside into
the stretch then gave way. SWAMP WITCH HADDY was through early.

Footnotes
WHAT A RUSH pressed the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead then widened the balance of the trip under strong handling to win as much the best.
LADY ITCH with the second flight three wide, dropped back on the turn, came on again five wide through the stretch and got up for second.
BRILLIANTBENNY stalked the pace near the inside into the stretch, angled out bumping WESTERN HOPE then finished determinedly. WESTERN HOPE
with the second flight three and two wide, was bumped entering the stretch then outfinished. FAMILY JET had a mild rally late outside. DANCE MOVES
failed to menace. VOLUME LEADER sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set the pace into the turn, then drifted while tiring through the stretch.
REACHING FOR GOLD had brief speed. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
