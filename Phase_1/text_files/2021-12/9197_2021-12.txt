Footnotes
ZEN PI sped to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail and was kept to his business in the drive. VISUAL ARTIST raced forwardly in the two path,
was between horses through the stretch and finished willingly. RISING PERRY circled the turn three wide, was floated to the five path in mid stretch and
offered a mild gain. SPITBALL , three deep around the turn chasing the winner, weakened. STAY IN hugged the inner rail throughout and weakened in the
drive. BARDOLINO circled the turn four wide, had aim on the leader in upper stretch and weakened. CHAMBO saved ground on the turn, swung wide in
upper stretch and came up empty. BOURBON AND ICE , four wide leaving the turn, was outrun. SPOTTED BULL , outrun, swung wide in upper stretch.

Footnotes
DAPER'S DRINK , taken to rate while saving ground, eased out advancing mid turn, cruised up four wide outside a trio of embattled foes near the three
sixteenths, kicked clear under some right handed asking then eagerly pulled away while steadily hand ridden the final sixteenth. TRADITION , unhurried
early while toward the rail, angled out and followed the winner four wide into the stretch, shifted a bit wider to give chase past the three sixteenths, flattened
out some late but managed to save the place. GALILEAN MOON bobbled at the break, raced well back through the opening five furlongs, came five wide for
the drive and churned on. EL EQUALIZER broke on top but outward, corrected and stalked off the rail, bid three deep into the lane, dueled past the three
sixteenths then faded. STROLLED ON BY lacked speed, came five for the drive, edged a bit closer nearing mid stretch then failed to seriously sustain.
GLORIOUS WEEKEND stalked inside, edged up past the three eighths, got through along the rail and challenged into the lane, sparred past the three
sixteenths then weakened. SHANGHAIED ASTORIA failed to meance. PEACHY KEEN was outrun while very wide in the drive. IRON PEARLS broke a
step slow, rushed up soon after and cleared rivals from the inside, set the pace two wide into the lane, dueled between foes soon after then weakened in the
final furlong. ARTILLERY was not a factor. TEMPTING MOMENT flashed speed, gave chase off the rail and tired mid turn. OLYMPIC GOLD , well placed
two wide, faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
TENAX prompted the pace outside MAILMAN'S A FLYER, overtook that one inside the eighth pole and drove clear. MAILMAN'S A FLYER hugged the inner
rail setting the pace, was collared in mid stretch and weakened late. PICKIN SEA GLASS , three deep around the turn, chased the pace in an even effort.
RAHMER raced well off the rail and failed to rally. HELLO AMIGO saved ground around the turn and weakened. VANHOOFER , three wide around the turn,
failed to rally. UNCOMMON VALOR lacked speed and was fanned five deep leaving the turn. TRIGZ TOO was not a factor. SUMMUM NOOR , no factor,
drifted to the four path leaving the turn. DUNE DUNE trailed.

Footnotes
HARD TO BE HUMBLE sped to the front and set a rated pace, responded when set down two wide past the three sixteenths, kept on under strong handling
through the final furlong and proved best. HE'S ORIENTATE chased off the rail, came four wide for the drive, drifted in a bit near mid stretch, shifted back
out and finished gamely between foes to nab the place. ALGEBRAIC prompted the pace outside the winner, was under strong handling pursuing past mid
stretch then gave way grudgingly. MAGIC MULE rated in the clear early on, advanced three wide between foes around the turn, angled four to five wide and
rallied. JACKIE A saved ground under asking mid turn, altered off heels in mid stretch but went evenly late. THIS ILL DEFEND lagged off the pace, saved
ground into the lane, eased out and offered a slight kick. SUBJECT TO CHANGE stalked inside, was under asking mid turn and had aim two wide into the
lane, drifted in near mid stretch and faded. RIPPOLINO lacked speed and raced three deep leaving the far turn, angled five wide in upper stretch but lacked
a solid run. AL BROWN , between foes early, chased off the rail in upper stretch and faded. FERMAT , off the pace, raced between rivals leaving the far turn
and lacked a rally. INSPECTOR FROST , off slowly, angled out while advancing near the five eighths, was used four wide outside rivals into the turn,
pursued and gave way. TOP BOSS , three to four wide, drifted well wide approaching the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
MILITARY HOP hugged the inner rail disputing the early pace, opened a clear lead mid way on the turn, drifted out a bit in upper stretch and drew off with
something in reserve. POINT DRIVEN lacked speed, was five deep on the turn and had a slight rally outside foes. FRANKEE MERCH raced in the three
path between horses around the turn, remained between foes through the stretch and finished willingly. WARM SUNNY BREEZE stalked the pace in the
three path on the turn and weakened in the drive. TAPPAHANNOCK hugged the inner rail most of the trip and failed to rally. GOLAZO was not a factor.
SUNMAN , in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, was outrun and raced five wide leaving the turn. CHAMPIONSHIP ALLEY was not a factor. TORRES
DEL PAINE was outrun. PROUD ENOUGH was no factor. KEEPING THE PEACE , four deep chasing the pace on the turn, gave way. PHANTOM RO
disputed the pace outside the winner and faltered.

Footnotes
BOURBON WILDCAT rated close up between foes early, dropped in to secure the rail leaving the far turn, prompted the issue in hand then bid along the rail
near the quarter pole, wrested command in upper stretch, spurted clear soon after then stayed on gamely under a drive to keep MATTITUDE at bay.
MATTITUDE , with the pace between foes, took command leaving the far turn, was headed from her inside soon into the lane, gave hard chase as the
winner cleared in mid stretch, made a game comeback inside the sixteenth pole but was denied late. MAGICAL LUNA , four deep forcing the pace, was
under pressure pursuing into the lane and kept trying. RESPONSE TIME rated outside foes early on, came under pressure mid turn, shifted five wide for the
drive but lacked a solid run. HUFFLEPUFF bobbled at the break and was bumped, quickly recovered and tracked inside, dropped back leaving the far turn,
made a mild comeback near mid stretch but failed to seriously sustain. BE GOOD , in range two to three wide, failed to respond. SPECIAL FREEDOM , off
slowly after she came in at the break and bumped HUFFLEPUFF, raced well back while saving ground and failed to make an impact. MIRANDA'S
DESMOND sped to the front, set the pace to wide, was caught between runners after being headed leaving the far turn, stayed on to force the issue to the
quarter pole then gave way. MILLIE CHILD lacked speed, circled wide into the lane but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
BUSTOFF saved ground around the turn while setting the pace, opened up in mid stretch and was kept to his business. TORCH OF TRUTH , well off the
rail on the turn, was fanned to the five path in upper stretch and had a mild rally outside foes. WHISKEY AND YOU , in the two path around the turn, chased
the winner and faded. MCCAIN lacked speed, was fanned six wide in upper stretch and was never a factor. CROUCHELLI , in close quarters leaving the
starting gate, saved ground on the turn, worked between horses in the stretch and was no factor. BOBBY G , wide on the turn, was outrun. CARIBBEAN
(AUS) , up close early while off the inner rail, drifted out in mid stretch when tiring. NEWSTOME stumbled at the start, raced along the inner rail while
stalking the pace and weakened. SPEIGHTSFORD , three wide chasing the pace to the stretch, faltered.

Footnotes
BOSS LOGIC was hustled up between foes soon after the break then went clear into the first turn, set a rated pace towards the rail, was joined by BIG
VENEZUELA nearing the half mile marker, sparred with that one past the five sixteenths, had that rival go clear into the lane, battled back under pressure to
re engage in mid stretch then steadily kicked away under a drive. BIG VENEZUELA , three to four wide moving to a stalking spot past the three quarter pole,
moved up in hand past the five eighths then drew alongside the winner, dueled then began to drift out when clearing near the quarter pole, continued to drift
and was well out the track past the three sixteenths, was corrected with right handed asking, ceded the lead inside the eighth pole but kept on trying to the
wire. MOHAAFETH was rated back off heels into the first turn, then angled out, edged up wide into the far turn, advanced under a ride four wide into the
lane then flattened out late. FRIENDLY FELLA stalked towards the inside, eased out under pressure for the drive but came up empty. TITAN'S WILL broke
outward then was corrected and sent up to contention, stalked the winner through the backstretch, raced between foes leaving the far turn and weakened.
ROYAL NUMBER , taken to rate, was under asking three wide leaving the far turn and weakened. THE ANGRY MAN saved ground off the pace, was under
pressure nearing the far turn but failed to respond. UP AGAINST IT , between foes early, faltered.

Footnotes
BAHAMA CHANNEL hugged the inner rail stalking the pace under confident handling, swung to the four path approaching the stretch, swept to command in
upper stretch and pulled away while kept to his business. MY GOOD MAN lacked speed, angled off the rail leaving the far turn, was taken to the seven path
in upper stretch and passed tired foes. HAYNE'S FEVER , three wide the first turn, circled foes on the far turn, was fanned to the eight path in upper stretch
and had a mild rally. LOST MY VOWCHER , shuffled back early, circled the far turn four wide, weakened and passed tired rivals late. AMEN CORNER
lacked speed, raced along the inner rail leaving the backstretch, eased out for the drive and failed to rally. MICE AND MEN showed speed outside horses
on the backstretch, had a three wide bid for the lead leaving the far turn and faded. MY SACRED PLACE , four wide entering the first turn, prompted the
pace two wide down the backstretch and around the far turn then tired. LADDIE LIAM set the pace along the inner rail and faltered in upper stretch.
