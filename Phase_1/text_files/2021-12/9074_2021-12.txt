Footnotes
DIAMOND CRUSH broke outward and moved quickly to press the pace, chased on the turn, led upper stretch, widened, then was wrapped up in the late
stages. OLYMPIC FENCER broke inward, moved up to lead, shook clear into the turn, quickened but was caught upper stretch, chased and held place.
LEGS LIKE SHACK briefly forced the pace, chased from the rail on the turn then finished gamely in vain. CARLA'S HONOR showed brief speed, dropped
back, was hustled three-wide on the turn then chased through the stretch. STOLE THE RING settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rear on the turn and
closed a gap in the stretch. TALLY ROAD settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn then finished gamely between foes.
DONTCALLMESWEETY settled well off the pace, closed three to five-wide on the turn then rallied outside. PICTUREDAY JESSICA pressed the pace,
dropped back on the turn then turned in a mild rally. PHIL IN ECHO raced in mid pack, closed two-wide on the turn but evened out in the final furlong.
VERMONT HOLIDAY bobbled at the start, forced the early pace, dropped back on the turn and lacked a rally.

16th out but faltered approaching the wire. MISTER OAKLEY was sent to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, was swarmed in mid stretch and gave
way grudgingly. KUDURO settled in mid pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn then rallied mildly. KNOPFLER settled in mid pack, saved ground on
the turn and stayed gamely on the fence in the stretch but leveled out late. ITMAKESMEWONDER settled off the pace, chased four to six-wide on the turn
but lacked a closing response. R U WATCHINGBUD settled off the pace, closed three to five-wide on the turn but never reached contention. NORTHERN

Footnotes
MAAKWA stumbled leaving the gate but sprinted to the lead, set a reserved pace then held sway under a drive. WAVE BABY stalked the pace, was roused
two-wide late turn then launched a determined drive, but missed. TRAGICALLY QUEWICK was rated off the pace, was hustled four-wide on the turn, rallied
outside and was gaining in the late stages. IGNITED stumbled at the start, closed from the rear but was a little rank in mid backstretch, rode the rail on the
turn, angled out in the stretch and finished gamely. EXCEED settled off the pace, closed three and four-wide on the turn then rallied belatedly. LAKE
SHORE DRIVE stalked the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn then finished evenly. VALHALLA AIR BASE stalked the pace, chased from the rail
through the turn and was all out in the stretch. MAD DOG N JOE, rated in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn but his rally stalled a 16th out.
MR NARCISSISTIC raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn then flattened out mid stretch.

Footnotes
LUCAS N' LORI broke a half a step slow, turned left behind the field to get into the two path and steadied a tad into the first turn, got down on the rail
midway on the far turn when advancing into range, was behind a wall turning for home and shifted in to get a seam at the eighth pole, dove to the fence for
the final sixteenth and outgamed a rival late to get the win. REDOUTE'S LIGHT sat along the inside in midpack, angled out three to four wide on the far turn
and widest in the five path turning for home, closed doggedly to get a brief lead but was outkicked by the ground saving winner to the finish. JEGOS FIRE
was five to four wide near the back on the first turn, circled three to four wide to loom outside the leaders at the quarter pole, bid with the eventual place
finisher in upper stretch but was outfinished by the top pair, a clear third. SELF INFLICTED off the pace two wide on the first turn, at the rear of the pack on
the far turn before rallying three to four wide into the stretch and gradually inched up down the lane without threatening the top quartet. SWEEPIN HARD
was four to three wide off the pace on the first turn, advanced in behind the leaders turning for home and outside the eventual winner but could only rally
mildly when space opened up in midstretch. FIRST SPRING was three wide chasing the leaders early, made a three to two wide bid on the far turn and had
the front by the quarter pole, headed at the eighth pole and tired from that point. GUITAR GEORGE was three to two wide in midpack early, ranged up five
wide on the far turn and in behind the eventual place finisher turning for home but his wide rally stalled in the final sixteenth. MIRACLE SILVER stalked the
early leader, took the front midway on the backstretch, was headed midway on the turn and began to lose ground, the rider up in the saddle the final
sixteenth. FORESTER'S DESTINY chased in behind the two leaders, steadied and dropped back down the backside, stayed on the fence on the far turn but
his rally was done by the eighth pole. D'S BEN was three to two wide in midpack on the first, dropped back three to two wide on the far turn and did not
recover. SUITEDCONNECTED reared up at the start and trailed by a wide margin, able to pass one straggler late. BLOCKBUSTER was inside on the front
early, passed by a rival midway on the backstretch and retreated from that point.

WARP RIDE broke outward, led quickly and moved clear, set a reserved pace and held sway under a hand ride. MENTORING broke outward and was
steadied, chased from the rail and two-wide on the turn then finished under a determined drive. SCOOT DADDY settled off the pace, closed three-wide on
the turn, angled out upper stretch and rallied from the outside. SIR FOR SURE settled in mid pack, circled five-wide into the stretch and finished gamely.
HILARIOUS AFFAIR was away slowly, settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn but evened out late. SEA TO AIR stalked the pace, was
steadied slightly approaching traffic while two-wide late turn then finished gamely along the rail. QUEENS QUAY stalked the pace, was chased three then
two-wide on the turn but finished evenly. MIDNIGHT ARKLE settled in striking range, came three-wide through the turn, posted a mild rally in the stretch but
did not menace. CITRUS BOY, steadied at the start, raced in mid pack, was hustled on the turn but lacked a rally. LANGSTAFF ROAD settled in mid pack,
was hustled five-wide on the turn but never reached contention. POT COMMITTED, away slowly, settled off the pace, was hustled on the turn but failed to
menace.

Footnotes
BEYOND MYBUDGET chased the three rivals vying for the front, angled out at the quarter pole to loom three wide turning for home with dead aim in upper
stretch, had the lead at the eighth p[ole and drew off late. AFLEET KATHERINE sat in midpack in the two path, followed the winner's path from midway on
the turn to the wire, inching away late to be a clear second after being in tight between runners at the sixteenth pole. LADY WAR MACHINE was three wide
in midpack early, three to four wide into range at the quarter pole and out in the six path turning for home, continued to inch up late for the show spot late.
BEAT THE SYSTEM pressed the front three wide, was floated out by the winner into the four path turning for home and outkicked in the final furlong.
MERVEILLEUX off the pace early, closed into contention in the two path down the stretch but flattened out in the final seventy yards. ABOVE ALL NAMES
hopped at the start and trailed by a good margin, rallied in the three path in upper stretch and dipped back to the rail inside the eighth pole, mildly rallying in
the final stages. MUSICAL RIDE off the pace and two wide early, tipped out to the five path turning for home and ducked in suddenly in upper stretch,
rallying mildly after that. OCEANS OF LOVE rushed up inside two rivals to stalk from the rail, bid on the turn and had the lead from early on the bend to the
eighth pole, tiring and losing positions in the final furlong. ROSEBUD'S HOPE won the break and had the early lead but was soon challenged by rivals to
her inside and outside, staying game to the top of the lane but tiring down the stretch.

Footnotes
HARD EDGE stalked the leader, pressed and bid on the turn, grinded it out to get the front at the sixteenth pole and needed the wire late to hold off the late
closing second place finisher. LADY MOONSHINE three wide in midpack early, angled out into the four path turning for home, accelerated in the final
sixteenth to just miss getting up late. BIG GINGER led early, was stalked and pressed by the winner throughout, headed at the the sixteenth pole but was
stubborn to the finish, staying game late. TWISTER ALERT off the pace early, rallied three to four wide on the turn and was outside the eventual place
finisher in the seven path at the top of the lane, outkicked by that one but closing enough to outrun the rest for a minor award. ASHBURY chased along the
rail, tipped out to three wide into the stretch and ran evenly on her wrong lead to the sixteenth pole when she switched to her proper lead and finished up
fine. USING COCONUTS off the pace, in the two path on the turn before inching up down the lane before levelling off at the sixteenth marker. SHAN'S
TIGER was three wide chasing the two early leaders, still three wide on the turn and drifting out into the lane, running up and down in the stretch. CRYSTAL
CRESCENT on the rail and off the pace, stayed inside on the turn and rallied down the stretch but levelled off in the final furlong. AWESOME TREAT began
awkwardly and was grabbed up by the rider, trailed far back but did manage to get into the pack while four wide on the turn but couldn't threaten at any
point. IMAGINARY SKY was always at or near the back, no rally forthcoming at any point.
