Footnotes
UPTOWN GEORGIE was quick to begin to set all the pace along the inside and built a long lead through the stretch run under a steady hand ride.
JHESSABELL was off slowly, settled off the early going, moved up three to four wide in the lane but was no match for the winner. RB RATH dropped back
early on, moved up two wide through the drive and showed good late interest. WMA FIREBALL settled off the early pace, raced five deep near the quarter
pole and raced along for third in the drive. ON THE VERGE stalked the early pace, saved ground and had no response. FLYINGJ GIDEON was forwardly
placed to lay up close early on and weakened the final eighth of a mile. RB WHISTLIN DIXIE failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
ONE GUY all out, just lasted. BAT QUICK JESS game effort, appeared short. REY DONOVAN sandwiched, start, closed willingly. BESO broke in, bumped,
late rally. ETHICAL INTRIGUE broke out, bumped, even effort. GLORIOUS EAGLE rallied, faded. C OF A HEARTBREAK flat, no threat. IRWIN never a
factor. BP FIRST CORONA failed to fire.
