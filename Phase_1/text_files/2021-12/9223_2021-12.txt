Footnotes
AH LEAH was forwardly placed early on, took command into the far turn and was well clear late under steady handling. GOSHEN GIRL was bumped at the
break, stalked the pace along the inside down the backstretch, continued to race near the rail in the stretch run and was no match for the winner late.
BELLS OF JOY was allowed to settle to the middle of the pack early on, moved up five wide near the three sixteenths pole and showed good late interest.
CARMEN O'ELECTRA stalked the early going, raced three wide while racing between rivals and had not enough in the drive. RULER DAENERYS stalked
the pace from the outside, raced three to four wide and weakened a bit in the latter stages. MEDIA PRINCESS broke awkwardly, was slow early on, raced
four wide into the upper stretch and had no late response. STARLET WARRIOR vied for the early lead from the inside and gave way. DESTINY ROAD was
off slowly and never was a factor. CYBERTAP failed to respond. PIPPITY DO DA failed to sustain a bid.

finished well to get up under strong encouragement. A FAST BROAD showed good early speed to set the early pace along the inside, raced clear inside the
eighth pole but couldn't hold off the winner late to finish second best. BE AUTHENTIC tracked the early leader while racing two wide and weakened a bit in
the final stages. LION LOVE stalked the early pace, raced three wide in the lane and had no final winning bid. LITTLE CHICK was slow early on, moved up
five to six wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. PRESENT OF HERO stalked the early pace from the outside, raced five deep near
the three sixteenths pole and had no late response. DARING DAMSEL settled off the early going, raced along the inside near the quarter pole and never

Footnotes
SHE'S A BIG STAR settled to the middle of the pack early, moved up six wide into the upper stretch and finished well to draw clear late under strong
encouragement. RONAN was slow early on, raced near the rail at the quarter pole, moved up two deep in the stretch run and finished well to get up for the
place position late. FANCY EMPRESS stalked the early going, moved up four to three wide in the lane and made a good late bid. AVASARALA showed
good early speed from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. GODSGIFT stalked the top pair down the backstretch, raced three wide in the
lane and weakened in the latter stages. COUGER broke to outside, bumped with rival, settled off the early going, raced four wide near the three sixteenths
pole and had no final winning bid. HOOSIER GOLD CASE was shuffled back at the break, dropped back early, raced towards the inside down the
backstretch, raced just off the inside in the stretch run and had no response. FILLY FROM ILLY broke in at the start, pressed the early leader from the
outside and tired. PRINCESS TINE (FR) dropped back early, raced four deep into the upper stretch and never was a factor.

Footnotes
GO STORMIN GIRL was quick to begin to set the early pace, raced near the rail throughout and drew off in the final stages to be well clear under steady
pressure. TRIPLE SCOUT was off slowly, dropped back in the early stages, experienced traffic nearing the three sixteenths pole, waited, shifted three wide
and made a good late gain to get up for the place position. COWGIRL KIMMIE stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide into the upper stretch and
had no final winning bid. LADY ATLANTIC stalked the early going, was placed towards the inside and raced evenly late. ARCH FLYER was bumped at the
break, raced four wide in the stretch run and had no late response. FLYING BUSINESS was unhurried early on, raced six wide into the upper stretch and
had no late rally. FIRST SQUADRON chased the early leader and tired while racing three wide. GHAALEB'S APPEAL was allowed to settle early, saved
ground and had no response. LOUIE P was bumped on both sides at the break, raced at the back of the pack early, raced three wide and never threatened.
SUPERSTAR DIVA broke in, bumped at the start, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor.

RARE ACTION ATTACK was allowed to settle to the middle of the pack in the early going, moved up four wide near the quarter and finished well late to get
up under strong encouragement. STORMY EMPIRE pressed Sheza Savage in the early going, raced in the two path around the far turn through the stretch
and held the place position late. LONG TALL WOMAN broke through the gate pre-race, stalked the top trio down the backstretch, moved up three to four
wide and made a good late gain. SHEZA SAVAGE was quick to begin to cross over to rail in the early stages and weakened a bit late while continuing to
race near the rail. PLAY TWENTY was off slowly, rushed to contention, raced between rivals near the far turn, drifted in the stretch and weakened late.
AROSE FOR LYLA was unhurried early, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no response. LITTLEBITOFBLUSKYS dropped back early,
saved ground and never threatened. ROMANTIC ATTACK was slow early and failed to respond.

Footnotes
EL ASESINO stalked the pace from the outside, moved up four to three wide through the stretch while racing between rivals and got up under strong
handling. VALIANT VINNY hopped at the break, stalked the top trio down the backstretch, moved up four wide and finished willingly to the wire. RIDE INTO
THE SKY chased the early leader from the inside and kept on through the drive. FIRST MASAMUNE was unhurried early on, made a steady advance
around the far turn, was fanned seven wide into the upper stretch and gained ground willingly late. ON K P settled off the early pace, raced four deep
around the far turn and had no final winning bid. MKAR THE FAST stalked the early pace from the inside, raced four wide into the lane, experienced traffic
just past the sixteenth pole and had not enough. MEDAL OF FACT showed good early speed to set the early pace and weakened while racing three deep.
TOM'S LAST GENERAL was slow early, raced six deep near the three sixteenths pole and had no response. MAC PANDOWDY dropped back early, raced
towards the inside and never was a factor. STALLONE raced four deep in the lane and failed to respond.
