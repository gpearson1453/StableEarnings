WILD FOX stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to draw clear on the turn, then drew off in the drive to prove much the best under
right handed crop urging. MANGO TREE was off a step slow, chased the pace four wide and made a bid four wide on the turn, but flattened out, while
coming back late to regain the place award late towards the inside. SMILING SILAS was four wide into the first turn, then settled three wide, eased out and
came five wide into the drive while making a bid, but flattened out late losing the place award. DOM CAETANO (ARG) was settled back early, angled out in
mid stretch and had no rally. DRAMATIC KITTEN chased the pace two wide and weakened. YOU'RE IN COREY set the pace on the inside and stopped.

CURLINGTON was bumped at the start, was settled back early, advanced on the turn, angled out leaving the quarter pole five wide, closed well to draw
clear late to prove best, driving. CHRISTIAN C was reserved early, then advanced four wide on the turn, continued that move and led in the stretch but
could not go with the winner late, second best. P H FACTOR stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn and weakened in the final
furlong, stayed on for the show award. Z U SOON was settled early while three wide but lacked the needed stretch bid. DIDDLEY sent to the front and
crossed over to set the pace on the inside and weakened. TAP THE MOJO chased the pace from the inside and weakened. CAMPIONI lacked a rally.
COWBOYS DREAM lacked a late response. THE LAST OPTION failed to menace. TRY TRY AGAIN tired.

SHARP HERO was rated along early, made a four wide move on the turn, then kicked clear in the final furlong to prove best under a drive. CHROME
ATTACK set a pressured pace early, then vied for command leaving the turn on the inside, dug in gamely in the drive but could not match strides with the
winner late while staying on for the place reward. HONEY MUG was well placed early on the inside, then angled out leaving the furlong marker and finished
willingly but needed more, missed place award. MAYSTART was reserved early, then advanced five wide on the turn and came six wide into the drive and
had a belated rally. MANHATTAN LEGACY chased the early pace on the inside, eased out on the turn and offered no kick in the drive. LIPLINER pressed
the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command between horses leaving the turn, but weakened in the drive. SHE'S A BIG STAR
was bumped at the start, lacked a rally. BELLE BREZING was bumped at the start, then was not a factor. AVASARALA was settled early and made a mild
move four wide on the turn and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
ALMAFUERTE was rated along the inside, then was three wide off the turn, angled in by the three sixteenths to make a bid, then edged clear to prove best
under a drive. NICE AND TRUE was allowed to settle early and was four to five wide on the turn while advancing, then made a bid on the outside in the
stretch and finished willingly. FIRST SQUADRON stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, gained a short advantage then faded the
final furlong. HER GOLD MINE was allowed to settle and made a mild bid four wide leaving the turn but flattened out. FIVE QUEENS was reserved early
and was five wide on the turn, then was six wide by the quarter pole and improved postion late. SILVERA passed the tiring rivals. PRESENT OF HERO
lacked a rally. BIT MONEY lacked a late response. DARING DAMSEL was bumped at the start and failed to menace. NEW RULES set the early pace on
the inside and weakened. CONSTANCIA was not a factor.
