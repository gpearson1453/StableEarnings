Footnotes
QUEEN ROSEMARY was rated along three wide, then shifted out five wide by the three sixteenths, closed well on the outside to edge away late under mild
urging. ANGINETTI was allowed to settle early, made a inside bid entering the stretch, but was outkicked late by the winner. BEST CAUSE stalked the early
pace and made a three wide bid to gain a short lead by the furlong marker but flattened out late. BALI threw head and was off five lengths last at the start,
then made a huge four wide sweep on the turn to loom boldly leaving the turn but flattened out. DANCE LIGHTLY was well placed early on the inside, then
was boxed by the quarter pole, shifted out three wide leaving the turn, then was blocked to the sixteenths pole, then had a mild late gain in traffic, rough trip.
PROMISE OF JOY set the early pace to the top of the stretch and then weakened.

AMIGOS GUITAR was well rated early, made a three wide bid in hand on the turn, took over leaving the quarter pole and drew clear to prove best under left
handed urging. BUFF AND SHINE dueled for the early lead three wide, then made a bid on the turn and dropped down towards the inside, then deueled
with the winner by the quarter pole and proved to be no match for that rival while clearly second best. TALENTED T J dueled for the early lead on the inside,
then fell back on the turn, then came again late for the show award. SPEED SLOT tracked the early pace three wide, made a four wide bid by the quarter
pole but then was empty in the drive. BRANTLEYS BIG GUN was off slowly and then was not a factor.

CUCKOO FORCONONUTS chased the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn, drew clear by the quarter pole and then drew out to prove
much the best under mild urging. LIFE ON THE EDGE chased the early pace from the inside, shifted out and came into the drive four wide, finished willingly
but was no match for the winner while clearly second best. STOP TALKING was allowed to settle early, advanced four wide on the turn, came five wide into
the drive and finished evenly, bested rest. PRANK CALL chased the pace from between rivals and weakened. COME AND GET IT lacked a rally. MARIE
FROM PARIE set the early pace while clear and gave way.
