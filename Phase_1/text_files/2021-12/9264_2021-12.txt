BRODY'S CAUSEWAY settled off the duel inside, advanced two wide between foes around the turn, angled in near the quarter pole, seized command in
upper stretch and drew clear while ridden out. LA BOKAINA vied between foes down the backstretch, steadied briefly entering the turn, chased the pace
three wide around the bend and stayed on to gain the place without threatening the winner. UNCONSCIOUS set the pace two wide, drew clear around the
turn, was collared in upper stretch and weakened through the lane. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH broke two lengths slow, raced three two wide and never
threatened. DESIGNED TO DAZZLE had brief speed three wide. MOSA MIA was outrun outside. APPLES AND HONEY broke inwardly, rushed up inside to

Footnotes
FUTURE FLAY saved ground in easy striking range early, sat chilly continuing inside through most of the turn, moved out past the quarter-pole being given
her cue, responded readily and wore down the leaders from outside entering the final furlong. YOU'RE THE BEST tracked outside the early leaders three
wide, challenged outside FREEZER BURN after a half-mile, and stayed on between horses past the eighth-pole before yielding to the winner. FREEZER
BURN set the pace in the two-path for a half, moved in turning for home, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile. GAGA OH LA LA was slow into
stride, came four wide off the turn and finished evenly. AUBURN tired inside through the stretch. LYRICAL was finished early three wide. MADAME
BARRISTER broke a step slow, and trailed throughout inside.

Footnotes
UBIQUITOUS veered out and bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead between horses up the backstretch, took
over while racing in the two path around the turn, battled on the inside in upper stretch and pulled clear in the final sixteenth of a mile. FROSTED FAITH
tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path while racing around the turn, dueled on the outside in upper stretch
and was outkicked late, finishing evenly. EIGHTHANDBROADWAY dueled between horses up the backstretch and into the turn, dropped back to chase the
leaders from the two path from there, gained some ground back in upper stretch and chased the top two home. GHOSTLINER dueled for the lead on the
inside up the backstretch, dropped back to chase the frontrunners while saving ground around the turn, and weakened on the rail in the final furlong.
CANELO was bumped by the horse to his inside leaving the gate, chased the frontrunning pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced
in the three path around the turn and faded entering the stretch. ALGONQUIN trailed the field the entire way around the oval, raced in the three path around
the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and was never a threat.

FIRENSPICE hit the starting gate, steadied early, trailed in the two path, angled five wide nearing the quarter pole, circled the rest of the turn, was brushed
in midstretch, took over soon after, drifted out under left-handed urging near the sixteenth pole and straightened out and edged ahead under a tight hold
from there. BULLET ON TAP stalked the pace two wide, took over nearing the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch, drifted out under left-handed urging
and brushed the winner in midstretch, drifted back in after that and was second best late. JAN'S GIRL advanced inside around the turn and flattened out in
the lane. RACING QUEEN chased the pace three wide and faded in the lane. DOVE IN CHARGE chased the pace between foes and came up empty in the
lane. HOT CAROL set a clear pace along the rail, stopped, bled and was vanned off.

Footnotes
WHIMSICAL MUSE settled well within striking range early, ranged up three wide outside the leaders on the far turn, took over and went clear into the
stretch, and was kept to pressure. MY SWEET WIFE lagged toward the back for a half-mile, came two wide beginning to find stride off the far turn, angled
inside KITTEN'S ROMANCE in deep stretch and was up late for the place. KITTEN'S ROMANCE raced close up inside to the far turn, shifted out with aim at
WHIMSICAL MUSE in upper stretch, could not reach the leader and was outfinished for second. KISSING FROGS raced in the second flight from the
outset, shifted out three wide approaching the lane, and made no real impact. MIRABELL MEI saved ground outrun for six furlongs, fanned widest for the
drive and made no headway. JOSEFA vied inside CRYSTAL COAST early, could not cope with WHIMSICAL MUSE after six furlongs, and retreated.
CRYSTAL COAST vied outside JOSEFA to the far turn, and had nothing left. TAKE ME AS I AM was three wide on the first turn, and was through early.
RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

turn, finished evenly outside and just missed second. CREATIVE CLOUD pressed the winner in the three path and weakened in the lane. CAJUN
COMMANDER was in range while racing two wide between foes, swung five wide in midstretch and lacked a rally. DREAMING OF GERRY trailed in the
two and three paths.

Footnotes
WOW TAPIT cleared for the lead leaving the backstretch, showed the way around the turn in the two-path, moved inside for the drive and held sway hand
urged. ARROW SHAPE broke a step slow, took closer order shifting out four wide approaching the stretch, and finished willingly outside the winner.
PRINCESS CUPID pursued WOW TAPIT from outside around the turn, had aim into the stretch and was outfinished. MIRACLE DRUG (IRE) raced three
wide, and was no threat through an even effort. SUSANS NOVELA moved inside early, and never made her presence felt. RESTLESS EYES bobbled at the
start, was five wide approaching the stretch, and could not reach contention. ROCK ALONG was five wide late on the turn, and faded in the stretch. MILL
LAKE LADY was far back throughout. LARA'S LADY led briefly after the start, was soon overtaken by WOW TAPIT, and was empty inside after
three-eighths of a mile.

Footnotes
MAMBA WAMBA (IRE) was away from the gate slowly, dropped back to trail well behind the field up the backstretch, improved position while saving ground
around the turn, entered the stretch still in last place, switched outside to unleash a bold bid passing the eighth pole and gained ground rapidly on the
outside to pull ahead late. IGLOO bumped and was squeezed back by the horses to either side at the break, raced in the middle of the pack between horses
in tight quarters up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path approaching the three eighths pole, swung wide entering the stretch, gained ground
outside down the lane and was caught in the final strides. HEADLINE HUNTER bumped with the horses to either side leaving the gate, recovered to duel for
the lead through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn, and finished well down the lane, getting run down by
the top two in the final sixteenth of a mile. MOON OF LOVE (IRE) bumped and was squeezed by the horse to her inside leaving the gate, settled in to stalk
the frontrunners from the rail up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began an inside bid entering the stretch, raced in tight quarters down the
lane and was outfinished from there with nowhere to go. HIGH SPEED STEF veered in sharply and bumped with the horse to her inside at the break, raced
off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, gained ground between horses down the lane and was outkicked late.
STRONGERTHANUKNOW chased the leaders on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the three path, improved position in upper stretch
and was outkicked in the final furlong. ABUSE OF POWER dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path
around the turn and in upper stretch, and weakened between horses in the final furlong. RUNAWAY ROCKETTE raced off the pace on the outside in the
opening stages, navigated the turn from the two path and came up empty in the stretch. HONORGETIC tracked the pace setters on the outside up the
backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the three path around the turn and continued to tire from there. NO RUN UP AVAILABLE.

Footnotes
CINDY'S SONG prompted the pace in the three path around the first turn, dueled two wide down the backstretch, drew clear rounding the far turn in the two
path, was confronted with challenges on both sides in midstretch and held firm. RADIANT GEM stalked the pace inside, angled three wide early on the first
turn, angled back to the rail in upper stretch, slowly gained inside of the winner but was unable to get by. STRAIGHT TO GO settled off the pace while
racing two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, had aim outside of the winner in midstretch, switched back to the left lead in near the sixteenth pole
and evened out. VINTAGE GIRL saved ground off the pace and lacked the needed rally. ICE LOVE was fractious pre-race, broke slowly, saved ground and
failed to menace. MIAMI SOUVENIRS chased the pace two wide for a half then retreated three wide around the far turn. GOSSIPING set the pace along the
rail and stopped nearing the lane.
