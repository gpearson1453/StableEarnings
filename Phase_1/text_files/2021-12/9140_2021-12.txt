Footnotes
BLAME IT ON BRUTUS brushed with a foe at the start, was ridden along in the middle of the field, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under
a drive, rallied in the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late. ROMANTIC MAN was urged along on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, was
driven five wide into the stretch, gained the lead outside the sixteenth-pole, led until the final strides but was caught. DATA DEAL tracked the pace on the
outside, was asked three wide midway through the turn, gained a short lead four wide into the stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong but was
overtaken while able to get the show. MOTION TO STRIKE lost his footing at the start but recovered quickly, showed speed on the outside of a foe then set
the pace, was asked in the two path on the turn, lost the lead coming to the quarter-pole and weakened. ALITE brushed with an opponent at the start,
settled towards the rear under some urging, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. MISTER J T showed speed on the inside of a foe,
was taken back off the pace under stout restraint with a half-mile to run, went around the turn in the two path, shifted three wide into the stretch and lacked
the needed response. OCEAN DEEP was urged along near the back, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. RYE RUNNER broke a step slow, was
ridden along at the rear, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
WHISTLING BIRDS set the pace under some pressure from the inside, shook clear in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch under the
crop, responded well in the drive and held under strong urging. TRUE GOLD broke out and bumped with a foe then was hustled, pressed the pace on the
inside of the winner, chased along the rail on the turn, had the rider lose his crop outside the quarter-pole, pursued the winner under a strong hand-ride in
the stretch and was second best. BAD GUY lacked early speed, was urged four wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and was along
for the show. GANDY DANCING was well placed down the backstretch, chased two then three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and
came up empty. JUST RIGHT was urged along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. DREAM BIGGER bumped with a rival at
the start, tracked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and tired. MANIFEST DESTINY brushed with
a rival just after the start, settled on the outside, was urged three wide on the turn and was no factor. JACOBA bumped with foes on both sides at the start,
settled under some urging, went around the turn in the two path, shifted four wide over heels outside the quarter-pole and failed to respond. DOUBLEPOUR
bumped with rivals at the start then dropped back while in tight, was urged along at the rear, went four then five wide on the turn, spun six wide into the
stretch and showed little. ALL TIMES WERE HAND-TIMED DUE TO A TIMING ISSUE

MISCHIEVOUS DIANE set the pace under pressure to the outside, vied along the rail on the turn, floated three wide into the stretch, kicked clear outside the
furlong marker and proved much the best under strong urging. JACKO'S DAY OUT broke out and brushed with a foe, was urged along off the pace, saved
ground on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch then moved further out, drifted out some around the furlong marker and finished willingly for the place.
MYTHREEBUTTERFLIES was taken up briefly early, moved closer with a half-mile to run, chased three wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and
weakened but held the show. SNOW LOVES A FIGHT broke out then brushed with a foe and was off a bit slow, settled at the rear, had the rider fall back in
the saddle leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. SENSEOFEXCELLENCE pressed the pace on the outside then in the
two path on the turn, was carried four wide into the stretch and tired. GOODMORNING ANGEL broke a half-step slow, was urged along off the pace, went
two to three wide on the turn and came up empty. TOOSWEETTOBESOUR moved out early then was ridden along on the outside, went four wide on the
turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
BREAKFASTATBONNIES showed good speed, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, responded well when asked for her best in upper stretch
and drew off under strong urging. ELOQUENT SPEAKER took an awkward stride against the rail at the five-eighths, chased the pace, raced inside early on
the turn, shifted three wide at the five-sixteenths and earned the place while no match for the winner. IMPAZIBLE DONNA was urged along on the outside,
went five wide for most of the turn then moved to six wide and narrowly earned the show. HONEY MONEY chased the pace on the outside, went four wide
around a majority of the turn then moved to five wide and tired. FAIR REGIS moved in with five furlongs to run, was urged off the pace, went around the turn
in the two path and lacked the needed response. BEAUTIFUL KAREN was hustled from the start then chased the pace, went three to four wide on the turn
and came up empty. WAILIN JOSIE settled at the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. HAPPY SOPHIA raced towards the rear
of the field, shifted from the rail to the three path early on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. VACAY settled under some urging,
went three to four wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
GLASS CEILING was urged along off the pace, went three then four wide early on the turn, shifted six wide outside the quarter-pole, rallied seven wide into
the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead before the furlong marker, shook clear into the final sixteenth and proved best while eased up in the final few
strides. CALL ON MISCHIEF settled off the pace, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and safely secured
the place while no threat to the winner. LETMETAKETHISCALL chased the pace down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, turned into
upper stretch under a drive and weakened while able to get the show. SADIE LADY went clear early, showed the way in the three path through the turn,
was asked for her best into upper stretch, lost the advantage outside the furlong marker and gave way. SONG RIVER chased the pace on the outside, went
four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and tired. STARFRONT broke a bit slow then was taken up some, moved up under urging, went five
wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and capitulated. JUST READ IT settled just off the pace, was urged three wide on the turn and had nothing
left.

Footnotes
BELLA PRINCIPESSA bumped twice with a foe just after the start, was urged along off the pace, advanced inside on the turn, gained in the two path into
the stretch, made a bid between horses at the three-sixteenths, shook clear into the final furlong, drew away under urging into the final sixteenth then was
eased up late while much the best. QUEENTIGUA chased the pace, went around the turn in the two path, gained three wide into the stretch, made a bid
outside of two foes at the three-sixteenths, lost touch with the winner into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place. MISSION TRAIL
broke and bumped with a foe, angled in at the rear of the field, saved ground for most of the turn, shifted four wide outside the quarter-pole, came five wide
into the stretch, checked while shifting out over heels shortly thereafter and improved for the show. HEY IT'S TATI bumped twice with an opponent shortly
after the start, was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. CHARLOTTE WEBLEY was urged along on the outside then
four wide on the turn and came up empty. TANGOBERG disputed the pace down the backstretch, dropped to the rail into the turn, lost the advantage into
the stretch and tired. BETTY'S SMILE was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn and failed to respond. BUSTINMYGROOVE dropped back
while ridden along, went four wide on the turn and also failed to respond. CAUSE TO DREAM bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace,
rounded the turn in the two path and capitulated. DONNYBROOK GIRL was last to commence, moved up on the outside to contest the pace, vied in the four
path on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and faltered.
