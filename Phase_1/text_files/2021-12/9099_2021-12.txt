Footnotes
YOUNG SKYWALKER was allowed to settled to the middle of the pack early on, shifted out to the four path approaching the quarter pole, his back heels
were clipped by Acting Scrappy, raced six deep into the upper stretch and drove clear in the final stages. A stewards inquiry was lodged for interference
nearing the quarter pole with Acting Scrappy and stewards ruled no change. HUNK OF A HIT was off a step slow, settled towards the back of the pack
early, made a steady advanced through the far turn, was blocked nearing the three sixteenths pole while racing two to three wide and finished willingly to the
wire. VALENTINE GUY pressed the early leader from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. DRAMACIDE stalked the top pair, moved up five
wide nearing the three sixteenths pole and flattened out. UNCORKED HUMOR showed good early speed to set the early pace while racing just to the
outside of Valentine Guy, took up nearing the eighth marker and tired in the drive. MAJESTIC THUNDER was slow early and never threatened. ACTING
SCRAPPY settled off the early pace, clipped heels nearing the quarter pole and was eased up on in the stretch.

Footnotes
LAST ROO was shuffled back at the break, raced towards the back of the pack after the troubled break, made a steady advance nearing the far turn angled
five to six wide into the upper stretch and drove clear in the final stages. LAB RAT stalked the early going, moved up four wide near the quarter pole but was
no match for the winner in the stretch run. BLUEGRASS BREEZE showed good early speed to set the pace from the inside and weakened a bit in the latter
stages. ROCKED was unhurried early on, raced three deep in the lane and had no response. GOLDEN ALE was forwardly placed to lay up close early,
raced between rivals and faded in the drive. ELLIE THE NURSE settled off the early pace, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no late
rally. OKIE CITY was coaxed along early and gave way.

Footnotes
YANKEE INDIAN dueled for the early lead while racing just to outside of That's Something, dug in late and prevailed in a determined effort under all out
pressure. THAT'S SOMETHING dueled from the inside and just missed in a game effort. FRIGERATOR settled off the early duel, moved up four to three
wide in the stretch run and finished gamely to the wire. CAPTAIN COMEBACK was off slowly, settled off the early pace, moved up five wide into the upper
lane and had no final winning bid. HUNTER'S LEGACY was off slowly, raced along the inside nearing the quarter pole, continued to race near the inside in
the stretch run and had no response. MY REAL DIAMOND was coaxed along from the outside, raced four deep near the three eighths pole and failed to
sustain a bid. COYOTE DEN was slow, saved ground and never threatened.

Footnotes
MONGOLIAN LOTUS stalked the early pace, raced five wide near the seven eighths pole, raced well off the inside in the lane, was well clear under right
handed urging and raced in hand in the final stages. BREAK AT DAWN settled off the early pace, raced four deep around the far turn and was no match for
the winner. GP'S AMAZING GRACE was off slowly, dropped to back of the pack early on, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had not
enough in the drive. BIG BASE raced evenly and had no late response. FETCHING FURY stalked the top pair and failed to sustain a bid. TIC TOC
TOCCET was unhurried early, saved ground and never was a factor. BROADWAY COUNTY showed good early speed to set the early pace and tired
readily.

encouragement. MISTY'S FOOL was off a step slow, moved up while racing near the rail in the lane and closed in well late. MONSTER RIVER raced four
wide around the first turn, stalked the early going and kept on willingly to the wire. COACH DAN pressed the early leader from the inside and weakened in
the final stages. ACTING WIZARD stalked the pace, raced five to six wide in the stretch run and had no final winning bid. CHARING CROSS settled off the
early pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. FROGGY dropped back early, raced five wide near the seven eighths pole, was four
deep nearing the quarter pole and never was a factor. ROGUE BOY saved ground and never threatened.

Footnotes
TOMMYHAWK was off slowly, slipped through along the rail into the upper stretch and finished well to be clear under strong pressure. HALF OURS TO
KEEP was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced three to four wide in the lane and kept on to the wire. OKIE STRONG was allowed to settle early,
moved up five wide into the upper stretch, led inside the eighth pole and weakened a bit in the final stages. SOUTHGATE was slow early on, moved up five
to six wide into the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. SHIPMAN'S SONG was unhurried early, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and
had no late response. OKIE STANDARD stalked the pace, raced four wide nearing the quarter pole and had no final winning bid. MEGA BOND stalked
early and failed to respond. JUST CHILLIN showed good early speed to set the pace and gave way in the drive.
