Footnotes
DOMINANT JOY broke a step slow, recovered to a forward position behind the leaders leaving the chute, moved readily three wide and took over outside
PLAYA INCLUSION and PAINTBRUSH past the five-sixteenths, opened daylight while roused mildly through the furlong grounds, and coasted in ridden out.
PAINTBRUSH pressed the early pace between horses, challenged outside PLAYA INCLUSION midway on the turn, could not keep pace with DOMINANT
JOY while moving out three wide approaching the stretch, stayed on her left lead and was clearly second best. BITTY BABY broke a couple lengths slow
and was devoid of speed for a half-mile, began to advance along the inside turning for home, continued on her left lead and went clear of the rest. PLAYA
INCLUSION set a pressured pace inside for a half-mile, and gave way approaching the stretch. QUENTESSA raced two to three wide, and tired after a half.
JUDGE JUDITH pressed the early pace three wide, retreated after a half, and was eased up through the late stages. BRAIN TRUST broke poorly, was
outrun three to four wide, and was eased up in the stretch.

Footnotes
WHISKEYONHISLIPS stalked the pace two wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, continued on the left lead in the lane, drew clear under moderate
urging and was vanned off. CAJUN MANDATE was reluctant to load, set the pace along the rail, was no match for the winner but stayed on to hold clear of
the rest. U U STAR bumped with PEMBERTON soon after the start, chased the pace two wide, lacked the needed rally but dug in to hold off a foe for the
show. GOGEES was pinched back at the start, advanced outside down the backstretch, raced four wide around the turn and was outfinished for the show.
DANLEY saved ground and failed to menace. PEMBERTON bumped with U U STAR after the start, checked nearing the turn and made no further impact
while saving ground. TESTED METTLE played no factor while racing two wide. MASTERSHIP was outrun while racing three and four wide. TIME OF
PEACE hit the starting gate and came in, bumped with COMMANDING not long after the start, raced four wide and was never a threat. REGIO made little
impact while racing five wide. BAD GUS was outrun inside. COMMANDING was bumped after the start, chased the pace three wide and retreated through
the lane.

Footnotes
CURRENT SITUATION raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path nearing the three
eighths pole, dueled outside in upper stretch, and kicked clear in the final sixteenth of a mile under a drive. ALL ABOUT KATHERN opened up a clear lead
while racing in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the far turn, dueled in upper
stretch and gave way late, the best of the rest. MAGICGIRL raced at the back of the pack in the two path through the opening half mile, began to improve
position while racing in the two path around the far turn, and gained ground down the lane while proving to be no match for the top two. GENERIC MARK
raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two path,
gained some ground in upper stretch and finished evenly. SHE'S HOT TODAY trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the
backstretch, raced in the the two and three path around the far turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch while never threatening. AFFICIONADO (FR)
saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and
flattened out in the stretch. DANCE TILL DAWN raced into traffic and steadied slightly while saving ground around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch off the pace on the inside, saved ground around the far turn and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
PRINCE OF IRON advanced toward the leaders four wide around the turn, battled outside HEY HOMBRE through a long drive and prevailed out in the
middle of the track. HEY HOMBRE set a pressured pace in the two-path to the stretch, drifted out under heavy pressure and could not stave off the top one.
GO HOME HAPPY raced two wide through most of the turn, cut the corner rallying mildly into the stretch, and finished evenly to be clear of the rest. CHIEF
ROCKA pressed the pace outside HEY HOMBRE for nearly a half-mile, and weakened. FIRST TEAM stumbled at the start and was outsprinted early, got
carried six wide outside FORT ATTITUDE late on the turn, and posed no threat. FORT ATTITUDE drifted five wide approaching the quarter-pole, and tired.
NATHANIEL'S HOPE was hustled along away from the gate but still outsprinted inside HEY HOMBRE, and could not keep up around the turn.

Footnotes
NOT SO EASY was forced outward entering the first turn, raced off the pace three wide early, cruised up four wide around the far turn, seized command
approaching the quarter pole, quickly cleared, continued on the left lead in the lane and held clear under a drive. ASTROTURF settled in range two wide,
raced three wide between foes around the far turn and finished willingly to gain the place. SWEENEY'S CAT chased the pace two wide, lacked the needed
rally and was along for the show. K. K. ICHIKAWA pressed the pace two wide, led around much of the far turn and weakened in the drive. SKYWALKING
raced off the pace three and four wide and lacked a rally. GOLDEN TONE lunged at the start, checked entering the first turn, raced two and three wide and
never threatened. LORD DARNLEY was hustled out of the gate, set the pace along the rail and tired nearing the lane. DRUM AND DRUMMER was pulling
early, checked off heels nearing the first turn, steadied along inside around that bend, dropped back inside, saved ground around the far turn, swung out in
upper stretch and had no response.

Footnotes
BIRD WILDCAT tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, switched outside to began a bid entering the stretch,
gained ground outside down the lane and pulled clear late. GRANDE SOIREE was reluctant to load, broke well to duel for the lead on the inside early, took
over while saving ground around the far turn, dueled in upper stretch and was caught late. SARAWAT stalked the frontrunners on the outside through the
opening quarter of a mile, raced in the three path around the turn, moved up to challenge approaching the quarter pole, and was outkicked by the top two
while finishing evenly, the best of the rest. BATTER UP BUD tossed his head at the break and was away from the gate slowly, settled off the pace on the
inside for the run up the backstretch, began to move up while racing in the three path around the turn and continued to gain ground inside in late stretch.
DR. CERFOLIO dueled for the lead between horses in the early going, dropped back to chase the frontrunner from the two path around the turn, challenged
entering the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. KRYPTON trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn
and passed tiring horses down the lane. MIGHTY MIRACLE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, came
around the turn in the three and four paths and was empty from there. SEA LANE raced off the pace on the outside in the opening stages, angled in to save
ground around the turn and faded entering the stretch. CHARLEMAGNERETURNS dueled for the lead on the outside in the opening furlong, chased the
leaders up what remained of the backstretch, began to drop back while drifting out to the six path around the turn and continued to tire in the stretch.

Footnotes
DILIGENT vied early outside FAMOUS GENT, took a short lead between that rival and CHAO midway on the far turn, shook off the latter in upper stretch,
and held sway late on the rail. CHAO was three to four wide and under a firm hold leaving the first turn, ranged up to loom a threat outside DILIGENT on the
far turn, got repelled into the stretch, then kept on willingly and was inching closer at the finish. FAMOUS GENT contested the pace inside to the far turn,
yielded to the top two finishers after six furlongs, then dug in late inside PAPA HONOR for the show. PAPA HONOR broke slowly and trailed for a half-mile
two wide, shifted out further for the drive and was outgamed for third. FLIPPING FISH saved ground on the turns, and faded after six furlongs. STANFORD
(IRE) was a length slow at the break, raced three to four wide throughout, and tired.

SEIZING THE DREAM settled off the early pace two wide, edged closer down the backstretch, remained up close two wide around the far turn, tipped out in
upper stretch, closed between foes under left-handed urging and was up in deep stretch. JERRY'S TURN rated off the pace along the inside, advanced
three wide around the far turn, rallied outside of the winner and just missed. LORD OF WAR dueled two wide to upper stretch, edged ahead of GOLDEN
INDY leaving the eighth pole and led until the final strides. BIG ART was off a bit slow, raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole
and rallied belatedly. GOLDEN INDY dueled inside to midstretch, continued on the left lead through the lane and weakened. CROWN OF HONOR was
outrun inside. MACEDONIAN was pulling while up close inside for a half and came up empty. THIS WAS HAND TIMED WITH FRACTIONS
UNAVAILABLE. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
AVOW lost her footing at the break and shied off HARD TO CAPTURE at a cost of several lengths, was a long way last early, got a tap on the shoulder
approaching the turn to get going, came through between horses suddenly gathering momentum after a half-mile, swung four wide in full stride turning for
home, overpowered SHEZA SPITFIRE in upper stretch and drew off hand urged. SHEZA SPITFIRE set the pace inside under constant pressure to the
stretch, proved no match for the winner after straightening away for the drive, but ran on with good courage to remain clear of the rest. MILES OF SMILES
broke two lengths slow and was outrun early, swung five wide off the turn and rallied mildly for the show. LONDON LADY tracked outside the early leaders,
was urged along three wide midway on the turn, and faded in the stretch. WINTOUR settled in the middle of the field early toward the inside, and lacked the
needed response. SEABROOK SUMMER raced three to four wide around the turn, and could not make her presence felt widest through the lane. HARD
TO CAPTURE moved menacingly four wide midway on the turn, but could not sustain the rally and faltered through the stretch. ADIOS BABE pressed the
early pace, and tired after a half. VALIANT MISS raced wide and was always outrun.
