Footnotes
BUFF N stalked off the rail the first turn then took over nearing the seven sixteenths pole, drew promptly clear and widened at the rail on the far turn and
was vigorously hand ridden to further extend her lead through the lane. MISS MORGANTOWN saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and settled for second best. DIXIE SUNRISE saved ground well off the early pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole,
angled to the five path through the far turn and came along for third mid-stretch. FLIRTING FUHR AVIE settled off the earlier pace about the three path,
picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. AUDREY LUCILLE was bumped leaving the gate but took the lead
nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, was caught approaching the seven sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point but
dropped back toward the three eighths pole and weakened leaving the five sixteenths. SUZIE Q SONDE ran in the four path the first turn and showed little
response through the backstretch. CORKY COWGIRL broke outward to make contact with Audrey Lucille then stalked from the three path, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole, though, faded through the far turn.

Footnotes
JAIME JAMEL pressured the pace toward the inside and raced close in the three path of the turn, dueled to the front leaving the sixteenth pole and raced
clear later yards. WE'RE FROM BRISTOL set a pressured pace and contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, dueled clear of Split The Pack at the
eighth pole but was caught mid-stretch and flattened later yards. ASCENDED chased toward mid track, rounded the turn about the three path and closed
well to take third later yards. FORCINEX chased the early pace toward mid track, rounded the turn near the rail and ran evenly down the lane. SPLIT THE
PACK pressured the pace and contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, then weakened past the eighth pole. WHAT ABOUT SHORTY gave
chase outside, rounded the turn about the four path and showed little further. BERRINCHE was not a factor. SWEET NATION gave chase inside and never
factored.

Footnotes
BUDDY'S RUN settled off the pace and off the rail, started a bid nearing the quarter pole and improved at the rail on the turn, eased to the outside of Castle
Five leaving the eighth pole, dueled to the lead between horses mid-stretch, ran clear past the sixteenth pole and held on well. FLUENT IN SARCASM
bobbled after the start then gave chase through the backstretch, raced close in the three path of the turn, though, ceded to the winner mid-stretch. CASTLE
FIVE took the lead at the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, contested the advantage at the rail on the turn but was caught mid-stretch and flattened
stride the final sixteenth. BEARCAT KITTEN pressured the early pace but dropped back at the three eighths pole, continued to give chase from that point
and rounded the turn two deep, then flattened inside the eighths pole. RING THE BELLA chased through the backstretch, ran off the rail on the turn and
finished evenly. GATTOSING gave chase toward mid track, ran in the four path of the turn and finished evenly. I'D LIKE TO KNOW gave early chase toward
mid track then saved ground on the turn. SHACKLED angled toward the inside to give early chase, ran in the three and four paths of the turn and showed
little in the lane. FIT BUT FAT steadied on the chute, angled to the outside to give chase and rounded the turn about the six path.

REIGN ON AND ON stalked three wide and took aim nearing the quarter pole, contested at a close disadvantage in the three path of the turn, dueled for the
lead through the upper stretch, drew briefly clear and held on well. AWESOME LAWSON chased through the backstretch and ran in the three path of the
turn then angled to the five path into the stretch, dug in for second later yards and finished evenly at the outside flank of the winner. BETTER CALL MAMA
closed to the lead nearing the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, was headed into the stretch and
continued a factor to mid-stretch before relenting. MISS CASEY set a pressured early pace then gave chase from the three eighths pole, dropped back at
the rail past the quarter pole then flattened the final sixteenth. SHINY PENNY chased and rounded the turn in the three and four paths, angled widest into
the lane and showed little further. TELL ALEXIS was not a factor. ACORN DANCER dropped well back early on. BLUE BONNIE saved ground.

Footnotes
GRACE ELIZABETH settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, took a slim lead past the eighth
pole and dug in determinedly to inch clear of COACH RUBE, who raced with the pace inside and came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn, gave up the nod past the eighth pole and relented the final sixteenth. DUBAI WAS LIT raced well off
the pace about the three path the opening turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn then dug in to take third the
final yards. LADY MADISON settled off the early pace inside then eased out into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
about the four path and ran evenly through the lane. SECRET CASTLE saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn near the rail, eased outward into the stretch and finished evenly. DISTORTED SPLENDOR raced with the pace two deep, gave chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage off the rail on the far turn and weakened the final furlong. SHE FIGURES settled back
about the four path on the first turn, showed little response through the backstretch and saved ground on the far turn.

Footnotes
LIL MR MATT tapered in to stalk the early pace off the rail, started a bid toward the three eighths pole and took the lead at the five sixteenths, drew clear
midway on the far turn and was steadily encouraged through the lane. DEPUTY JAMES saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and
rounded the far turn near the rail, then dug in through the lane to take second later yards. HERCULES HARBOR settled off the pace about the five path on
the opening turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced in the six path of the far turn and finished evenly to take third the final yards.
HUCKLEBERRY FRIEND stalked two deep on the first turn then took the lead into the backstretch, came under pressure at the three eighths pole, was
caught at the five sixteenths and gave chase from that point, but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened the final furlong.
MINDYOURPSANDQS saved early ground then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the eight path and passed
rivals outside. BLUE COLLAR BOY settled off the pace about the four path on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and ran in the five path of
the far turn, then flattened the final sixteenth. TWENTYTWENTY came through the opening turn in the three path and was well off the pace leaving the turn,
gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little more. NORMANDY'S EMPIRE rated the early pace
inside, was caught into the backstretch and gave chase, then weakened at the rail on the far turn. NOBLE EL SID settled off the pace two deep on the
opening turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole then weakened off the rail on the far turn.
