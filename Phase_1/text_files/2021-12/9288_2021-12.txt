Footnotes
I GOT A GAL stumbled leaving the gate, tossed his head and steadied between shortly after, continued to be hard to manage early on while trailing off the
rail, pulled his quickly to the front early on the backstretch, kicked clear and showed way to the far turn, angled to the inside and saved ground to the stretch
held well over the runner-up under urging. ELEUTHERA broke in and bumped rival leaving the gate, sped to the front and cleared early, lost command
nearing the nine-sixteenths pole, stalked the leader outside a rival up the backstretch, chased two wide into the lane, finished willingly outside the winner but
could not get by. STERLING CREST (IRE) was rated off the inside early, pulled at the five-eighths pole, traveled between runners leaving the backstretch,
entered the lane two wide then moved out and gained ground on the top pair late. EXIT SOUL broke slow and got bumped at the start, settled on the inside,
remained along the fence to the stretch, tipped out in the drive and kept on for a minor award. LUCKY GIRL (IRE) was rated on the inside early then
between foes in the middle stages, got crowded at the seven-sixteenths pole, blocked behind rival at the three-eighths, tipped two wide on the turn, angled
out with three-sixteenths remaining and summoned a mild response to improved position. ISOLA MIA was hard to load, stalked from inside to the stretch
and failed to produce a bid. LET FREEDOM REIN pulled and steadied off heels on the first turn, angled widest on the backstretch, came four wide into the
lane and lacked a rally. JERUSALEMA (IRE) broke a step slow, sat off the pace between rivals then chased two wide on the far turn and could not rally.
UNCORKED raced three deep around the first turn, between rivals on the backstretch, exited the far turn two wide, moved in some and failed to menace.
CELESTIA stalked outside a rival early then moved further off the rail, went three deep into the far turn, steadied at the quarter pole, came three wide into
the drive and had little left.

Footnotes
STARSHIP DEFIANT dueled for command from outside, cleared approaching the quarter pole, got tested by ZAHRA in the final furlong and held gamely.
ZAHRA traveled three then two wide on the first turn, stalked the top pair off the rail, took aim three wide into the stretch, bid outside in the final furlong but
was denied by the winner. STARSHIP SKY went four then three wide around the first turn, stalked the pace outside a rival or off the rail, gave chased three
to four wide on the second bend and finished evenly down the lane. CHROME OF OUR OWN got crowded a bit at the start, tucked inside for the first turn,
trailed the field along the fence to the stretch, tipped out in the lane and passed a tired rival. BIG AL'S PRINCESS dueled for the lead inside of STARSHIP
DEFIANT, lost contact with that rival approaching the quarter pole, remained inside to the stretch and weakened.

MR. T'S THIRSTY veered out at the start, angled in on the first turn and settled off the pace early, closed in from inside through the second turn, collared the
leader leaving that bend, took a short lead entering the stretch, kicked clear from MASHHAD FLATS and drew away. MASHHAD FLATS dueled from inside,
put away VELVET GHOST leaving the far turn but was soon challenged by the winner on the inside, relinquished the lead into the stretch and stayed on to
secure the place. VELVET GHOST dueled for command from outside, could not keep pace leaving the far turn and weakened to third. PRINCE HUSSAR
got bumped leaving the gate, stalked five then four wide on the clubhouse turn, remained closest in pursuit to the second bend, was urged along through
that turn while three then four wide and weakened in the lane. IM STILL THIRSTY got forced into PRINCE HUSSAR at the start, tracked four then five wide
around the first turn, remained four to five wide through the second bend and tired.

then drew away to the wire. GREGORY'S PRIDE sat off the pace, moved closer up the backstretch, spun three wide into the lane, lacked room in upper
stretch, steered out to a clear path and gained the place. SPIRIT MAKER dropped back early, went two then three wide around the turn, steered out in the
stretch and produced a late rally. MUCHO DEL ORO hit the gate at the start, vied four deep then dropped back to chase the leaders, angled into the two
path early on the turn then steered back out and came four wide into the stretch, put in a bid a bid and drifted inward in the lane and flattened out.

wide into the lane, angled out in the stretch and kept on to improve. PARNELLI chased between foes early, got bothered by outside rival coming in at the
seven-sixteenths pole, moved to the inside for the turn and lacked a rally. MAC DADDY TOO vied three deep for the lead, could not match strides past the
midway point on the turn and chased three wide into the drive and weakened. CONSTITUTIONAFFAIR chased outside a pair of rivals early, shifted to the

HOLDEN THE LUTE was forwardly placed early on the inside then angled out around the clubhouse turn, bid three deep on the second bend, took over with
a quarter mile remaining, cleared into the stretch, drifted inward in the drive and was kept to task to the wire. BUD KNIGHT tracked in the two path, raced
along the rail into the far turn then moved back to the two path leaving the bend, rallied between foes in the drive and gained the place. MONGOLIAN
LEGEND went three then four wide around the first turn, chased the leaders outside a rival, asked three then four wide on the final turn, could not find the
needed late kick and got edged for the place. STONE'S RIVER sped to the front and cleared early, gained pressure on the backstretch, dueled into the
second bend, lost the lead nearing the three-eighths pole, fought into the final quarter mile, then weakened in the stretch. SIR FLATTER traveled four then
five wide on the first turn, trailed up the backstretch and moved to the two path, steered out on the far turn and came five wide into the stretch and was not a
factor. PERFECTO AMOR stalked the leader off the rail, moved up to apply pressure on the backstretch, dueled into the far turn, took over approaching the
three-eighths pole, vied with rivals on the far turn, lost command at the quarter pole and faded through the lane.

Footnotes
WILDER THAN MOST pressed the pace from outside early, dueled into and around the far turn, cleared into the stretch and drew off. HAPI HAPI took the
turns three to four wide, rallied in the drive but lacked the needed late punch while holding the place. FLY TO MARS stalked a bit off the rail on the first turn,
chased the top pair along the inside then two wide into the stretch, drifted in at the eight pole and lacked the necessary bid. TALLEMARK went two to three
wide on the first turn, steered to the rail, lost his path at the eighth pole and flattened in deep stretch. BETITO set the pace under pressure, dueled into and
around the far turn and gave way in the stretch. MISCHIEVOUS PATH shifted out early on the first turn and went three to four wide around that bend, got
blocked behind tiring rival at the three-eighths pole and angled to the inside, moved back to the three path entering the stretch and could not rally. DR.
TROUTMAN bothered a bit by MISCHIEVOUS PATH shifting out early on the first turn, went up to attend the pace three deep, started to tire on the far turn,
eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
CHARGE CASH dueled for command from outside, battled three then four wide on the turn, put away inside rival with a furlong remaining but was soon
challenged by SQUALOTORO in the furlong grounds and held that rival at bay to the line. SQUALOTORO got brushed from inside at the start, sat off the
pace early on, advanced four to five wide around the turn, bid alongside the lead inside the eighth pole but could not get by. BRONN dueled for command
from inside, held a short lead into turn, battled two then three wide around the bend and faltered in the late stages. SLY chased the pace outside a rival,
went three to four wide around the bend and finished evenly in the final furlong. SALAH lacked early speed, entered the stretch five wide and summoned a
mild response to improve. RONAMO off slow to begin, advanced up the backstretch, went two wide into the turn then between foes at the five-sixteenths
pole and flattened out in the drive. HARBOR SKY broke out, traveled in mid-pack off the inside, navigated the turn four wide and failed to respond when
called upon. ACTIVE ACCOUNT broke slow and brushed with outside rival at the start, chased off the rail then moved inside, saved ground through the turn
and tired.

Footnotes
GOLD DRAGON QUEEN tucked inside early, traveled in mid-pack inside a pair of rivals, stayed inside then tipped two wide on the far turn, rallied through
the final furlong and flew late to inhale the runner-up. PAMMY'S READY stalked off the rail, bid outside at the three-eighths pole and quickly took over then
kicked clear from inside rival, drifted inward in the stretch and remained clear to the sixteenth pole but was run down by the winner in the closing moments.
SHE'S GOT A WAY was off a bit slow to begin, steadied off heels entering the first turn, went three wide on the first turn, raced outside rivals then advanced
five wide around the far turn, angled back some leaving the second bend and held the show. ROCK THE BOURBON was fractious in the gate, came away
awkwardly, lagged behind in the early stages, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out then angled in at the top of the lane and summoned a mild rally.
HEMMERLE traveled between foes on the first turn, chased off the rail up the backstretch, exited the far turn four wide and never threatened. GRANOLA
GIRL tracked off the rail, chased three wide into the lane and flattened out. CLASSICAL ROMANCE took the first turn three wide between runners, raced in
mid-pack in the middle stages, three deep at the three-eighths pole, exited the far turn three wide and failed to menace. BEACHGRASS went four then three
wide on the first turn, traveled in mid-pack three deep on the backstretch, exited the far turn five wide and had nothing left for the stretch run. DARLING
DONNA hustled to the front and cleared inside rival on the first turn then took control of the rail, was overtaken around the far turn, could not go on with the
leaded and tired in the drive. PRETTY RENA chased along the inside then two wide leaving the first turn, came three wide into the drive and tired.
