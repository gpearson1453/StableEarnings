TAPPED TO THE MAX broke sharply to duel for the lead with BIBLEMAN while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a sixteenth to run and held
off MIDNIGHT IN MAUI to prevail. MIDNIGHT IN MAUI settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a late rally.
MOONLITE GRAHAM was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, could not gain on the top pair in the drive but finished willingly. REDACTION off
slow, lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. BIBLEMAN disputed the pace from the inside and weakened through
the final furlong. MOJAVE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

SQUARE ROOT broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside with GOOD BOY ROY from the inside, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and
held off the closing BOOZYMILKSHAKEBAR to prevail. BOOZYMILKSHAKEBAR was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn
and finished with good energy to be getting to the winner late. WINNING MAGIC was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and finished
with a belated bid. GOOD BOY ROY was away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way through the final
furlong. OUR HY ROLLER settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and lacked the needed late response. EL MARIACHI lagged throughout.

Footnotes
ARIZONA SUN was away in good order to press the pace of LAST PUNCH while racing three-wide, moved up to vie with OUTSIDE THE LAW with a
furlong to run, vied with that rival and drew clear late. NAT GIO lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with a late rally. OUTSIDE
THE LAW chased the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up in tandem with the winner to offer a bid into the stretch, vied and gave way late. LAST
PUNCH set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. BURNADEBT showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn
and was not a factor. REIGN OF FIRE settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and weakened.

MISS MALIA settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew clear. BIG HEAT was off slow,
raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and back out in miid-stretch and finished willingly
when clear. HEART ON THE RUN broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside, opened a clear margin into the lane and gave way late.
MISCHIEVOUSOFFICER was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. IMA TROUBLE MAKER disputed
the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. BONITA DIXIE lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
CIBERTRUCK settled off the leaders early, checked nearing the quarter, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore inside
the furlong marker and drew clear. BODEGA dueled for the lead from the inside throughout, could not resist the winner late but finished well to hold the
place. EXETER was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, reached the leaders into the lane and gave way in the
drive. ACHILLEUS was off slow, showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. BALIUS was void of early foot, raced
four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly. EXPRESS PERMISSION was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the
second turn and did not menace. REDDISH was forwardly placed, moved three-wide through the second turn and weakened. ABANDONED disputed the
pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters.
