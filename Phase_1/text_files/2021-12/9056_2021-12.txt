Footnotes
BIG BAD BEAST off the pace early, had two rivals beat on the turn, came rail to three wide at the quarter pole and out in the six path turning for home,
closed resolutely outside the leaders at the wire to just get up in the final jump. BOUND LUCKY won the break and cleared rivals for the front early,
maintained an open length advantage into the final seventy yards but was was caught right on the wire by the winner. INVISIBLE FRIEND came up the rail
in behind the pack chasing the leaders and rode the brakes for a period of time, pulled off the fence two to three wide on the turn and tipped into the five
path down the lane, inching up while failing to change leads to grab the show. DETERMINED FRIEND rushed up four wide to chase the early leader, was
three wide in range on the turn and loomed into the stretch but lugged in down the entire stretch and could only garner a minor award. BAYTOWN ELVIS off
the pace, was outside the winner two to four wide on the turn and in the seven path turning for home, matched that one's energy to the eighth pole but
outkicked from that point while continuing to close mildly. MR. AGRO broke out and rammed a rival causing a chain reaction at the start, settled off the pace
and moved into midpack three to four wide on the turn but was out of run in the final sixteenth. RELOAD TIME was bumped in a chain reaction at the start
and taken up to trail, came from the back two to four wide on the turn and closed between rivals down the lane with a solid late run. THIS WAY OUT went to
his knees at the start, regrouped to rush up between rivals and chase the leader, stayed in contention until turning for home but levelled off in the final
furlong. SNOOKERED was bumped hard by a rival at the start, sat in the two path on the turn and put in a mild close down the lane without threatening.
SHAMBO was bumped in a chain reaction incident at the start, rushed up inside rivals to chase the early leader, retreated along the fence down the stretch.
TARASUS stalked the leader along the inside, dropped back to chase on the turn and retreated down the stretch.

Footnotes
D'S SOUL stalked the pace, closed two and three-wide on the turn, swept to the lead in the final furlong and held sway under a drive. PIQUET raced in mid
pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn and rallied gamely to the end. FRESH DREAMS settled in mid pack, came three-wide through the turn, closed into
the stretch and rallied between foes. TUSCAN DAMSEL settled in mid pack, was hustled five-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished evenly.
CLOSE IMAGE raced in mid pack, came two-wide and then along the rail late turn, launched an all out stretch drive but leveled off in the late stages.
SAMURAI FIGHTER settled in mid pack, rode the rail on the turn, was blocked a furlong out, came out a lane and rallied on the two-path. NAKED
ILLUSION settled off the pace, angled out from two to five-wide on the turn then finished under a determined drive from the outside. MY FINAL TRICK
showed early speed, dueled, shook clear late turn, was passed in the final furlong and faded. SECRET ARCHANGEL raced in mid pack, was blocked
four-wide late turn then rallied belatedly. J M R BOLD VISION dueled, chased into the stretch but flattened out with a 16th to run. PIERIAN lost her path
leaving the gate, raced in mid pack, came three to five-wide through the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch but her rally stalled. DISCREET BEAR
broke outward, raced in mid pack, rode the rail then evened out in mid stretch. SOMEONE ELSE stalked the pace, dropped back through the turn and
lacked a rally.

Footnotes
POUND GREEN stalked outside the early leaders, was four wide looming on the turn and into the stretch, bid and had the lead at the sixteenth pole and
held a lapped on rival safe to his inside late. OCELOT was three wide for the early lead in a scramble for the front, stalked and pressed the pace survivor on
the turn and had the lead turning for home, gave way grudgingly to the winner down the final sixteenth. HIGH HEAT chased behind the leaders throughout,
was in the two path in the stretch and lost his path, came out and herded a rival at the sixteenth pole looking for room and closed into the show spot late.
VIATURE off the pace and had only one rival beat midway on the turn, rode the rail down the lane and was closing in fast late, doing the best of all in the
final seventy yards. BROWNING ISLAND was inside a three way scramble for the front, stayed game to the sixteenth pole but gave way grudgingly in the
late stages. AMMUNITION moved up to chase the leaders between rivals early, dropped back behind the pace survivors three wide on the turn, was still in
contention at the sixteenth pole when steadied, levelling off from that point. PRINCE OF THIEVES angled off the inside to be four to five wide on the turn,
was closing in wide down the lane when a rival impeded his progress and he was forced to take up, faltering in the final seventy yards. READY HERO
began awkwardly and trailed on the turn, came three to two wide before angling out to the seven or eight path and putting in a solid wide close to best a
number of rivals in the final stages. WINGS OF VICTORY hit the side of the gate at the start and was off the pace, closed two to four wide on the turn and
put in a mild run down the stretch to pass a few. TALE OF MINESHAFT off the pace early, rallied three wide on the turn into midpack, but his run stalled in
the final furlong. SPEED WAY along the rail in midapck, was inching up down the lane before the rider stood up in the final stages. INFAMOUS COVERT
was off the pace and four to five wide on the turn, never in contention. ORPHAN HALLIE was between rivals for the early lead, dropped back to chase into
the turn and retreated down the stretch. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND A RIDER'S CLAIM OF FOUL IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW,
HIGH HEAT WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD POSITION AND PLACED SEVENTH FOR INTERFERING WITH PRINCE OF THIEVES NEAR THE
SIXTEENTH POLE.

SENOR JOBIM throughout, was headed by that foe past the 1/4 pole, dug in gamely while dueling in the stretch but was outkicked in late stretch.
LOOKINATAMIRACLE trailed the field in the early stages, raced two and three-wide on the turn, swung widest at the top of the stretch and rallied gamely.
