Footnotes
TRES CHIFLADOS broke on top then settled in to stalk just off the early leader, dueled outside that one through the turn going three to four wide early on
that bend and floating six wide into upper stretch, drew clear in the final furlong under steady handling. BRAZILIAN SUMMER was forwardly-placed to
dictate terms racing well off the rail early, dueled inside the winner through the turn drifting to the five path into upper stretch, was no match but second best.
DISPUTED tracked from inside, moved out five wide turning for home, continued to drift out a bit in the lane and secured show honors while no threat to the
top pair. THE GREATEST EAGLE tracked off the leaders between rivals, went two to three wide on the turn coming six deep into upper stretch, altered
inside a rival at that juncture and ran on. TESTING THE WATERS exchanged light contact at the break, settled off the pace, advanced three to four wide
and outside rivals on the turn, came into upper stretch seven deep and lacked a late kick. STARSHIP CHEWY failed to rally after racing in about the four to
five path on the turn and in the stretch. A CEE DOO CEE switched out in the early going, went three to four wide on the turn racing toward the rear, swung
seven deep into the stretch and failed to threaten. BECOME AN INSIDER exchanged a light bump at the start, shifted in through the early going, raced just
off the fence in the two to three path on the turn and was not a threat. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
HIT A NOTE vied three to four wide and between runners early, dueled outside a foe racing about three wide on the far turn, continued to battle in the
stretch and prevailed under steady handling. KEY TO THE CITY was forwardly-positioned inside, dueled inside the winner through the stretch and was a
game second. ALEXANDER WHO moved in several paths soon after the break, attended from outside rivals six wide early, was still within contention
outside and four wide into the far turn, evened out in the drive. AGRONOMO was caught seven wide into the first turn and eased back and shifted in early
on that bend, tracked three to four wide, kept on in the lane. DAN WHO settled well back racing on or just off the early early, began to advance between
rivals up the backstretch, went three wide on the far turn moving out six wide turning for home and gained mildly late. COOL AND QUICK was in just a hair
tight shortly after the break, settled at the rear in the four to five path, continued off the inside on the far turn advancing past rivals while moving seven wide
into upper stretch, ran on evenly late. SNOW IN THE NORTH was two to three wide in the back half of the field early, moved nearer the inside heading to
the far turn, saved ground on that bend and gained mildly. IT'S OVER DUDE contended four to five wide between foes early, moved in three wide dropping
back into the far turn, faded. SNIGGLE showed brief speed two to three wide, steadily retreated. PUB steadied when in tight quarters in the early going,
settled four to five wide thereafter and was not a threat.

Footnotes
MORE FIREWATER went to the fore after about the opening furlong to set the tempo from outside three to four wide, met the challenge of a rival nearing
the quarter pole still racing off the inside in the three path and drew off. BOB'SALLWICKED was mid-pack three wide early, tracked the leaders up the
backstretch, took slightly closer order two wide into the far turn, kept on to share the place. SQUALLSGHOSTMOVER was mildly coaxed into position
moving in two wide heading into the first turn, settled then off the leaders, moved out heading up the backstretch, was in just a bit tight entering the far turn
going four wide on that bend, ran on. POP QUIZ settled in the back half along the inside, began moving out on the far turn eventually fanning seven wide
into the stretch, improved position. ANXIOUS INDIAN settled just off the leaders four wide early, made a sweeping middle move five wide into the far turn,
took a narrow and brief lead past the three-eighths but could not sustain the effort. WILD FIREWATER stumbled at the start spotting the field a couple
lengths, moved out four wide early on the first turn, continued three to four wide on the far bend and made no late bid. SIXTH GEAR broke a half-step slowly
at the start, went five wide on both turns racing at the back, came into upper stretch eight deep and was not a threat. TALKABOUTNAVARONE pressed the
winner from inside, challenged that one up the backstretch, faded.

Footnotes
DIABOLICAL KING was bumped from both sides at the start, tracked in behind three wide, found room in the stretch and surged from between runners.
LESTER'S MEMORY attended the pace from outside going three to five wide on the turn, kept on in the lane. MICKEYS GOLD settled off the leaders
mid-division, saved ground on or just off the rail on the turn, gained late. SILVER PONZI bumped a rival then steadied at the start, moved forward under
some coaxing to race mid-pack between foes, went three to four wide on the turn, came out six wide for the drive and gained late. AISLE RUNNER settled,
went four wide on the turn, gained late. MR MOO was forwardly-placed along the inside, saved ground vying for the lead on the turn, made a bid and took a
narrow advantage in upper stretch but had no late kick. BABY SHAMU bumped a rival at the start, was forwardly-placed under some urging, raced two to
four wide and contending for the lead, faltered in the lane. GAMBLING COWBOY was last but one, went four to five wide on the turn, moved out nine wide
at the head of the stretch and gained mildly. JIM EDD WHO was within striking distance outside going five to six wide on the turn, came up empty for the
drive. FORGOTABOUTME chased six to seven wide, faded. MEGA SOURCE broke awkwardly, moved out four wide on the turn and was never a threat.
DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
WHERES BRAYDEN exchanged a light bump at the start, attended the pace outside four wide on the first turn moving clear late on that bend to dictate
terms off the fence, went two to three deep on the far turn, held sway under steady handling. WARRIORS MARK broke outwardly, was keen early racing
three wide in behind rivals, switched outside the leader four wide into the far turn, could make no headway but held the place. LONZO WHO saved ground
on or just off the rail, missed the place while running on strongly. READS PET ZENON exchanged a bump at the start, was up close early heading into the
first turn four to five wide, moved in three wide heading into the far turn after losing some ground into that bend, kept on belatedly. RIG RIDER broke a step
slowly and lost the path, moved outside a rival to go four wide through the first turn, passed foes four deep into the far turn but evened out in the drive.
MARK'S WARRIOR eased back and shifted inside a rival three wide heading into the first turn, moved up a bit two to three deep approaching the far turn,
failed to rally. QUINTON'S CHARMER was forced out at the break, raced on or just off the rail well back and was not a threat. BODIE GOT GOLD was very
fractious in the gate, showed brief speed inside, faded.
