Footnotes
WORLD WAR sped clear early on, got a breather into the backstretch as foes closed in, but kicked away from those rivals passing the half mile pole,
maintained a wide margin through upper stretch, but drifted outwardly passing the furlong grounds as AKIANE'S SOLDER gave chase, tired while
continuing to drift in the late stages as that foe menaced, but just lasted to the wire. AKIANE'S SOLDIER steadied after bumping with an inner foe soon after
the start, sat reserved far off of the pace along the inside, progressed into the far turn, shifted four wide turning for home while rallying, chased the clear
leader into the final furlong, flopped back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole, continued to close in while shifting outwardly to stay outside of the drifting
leader, bid missed reaching that foe on the wire. PRISSY JADEN settled off of the pace four wide, gained three wide around the far turn to claim place
entering the lane, but was outkicked for that position at the furlong grounds. RESPOSADO bumped an outer foe at the start, tracked along the inside, and
chased around the far turn before fading. LADY CHURCHILL bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked three to two wide, and failed to menace.
DREAM TOWN bumped an outer foe early on, then saved ground off of the pace, but was outrun. JERSEY HOTTIE stalked two wide, but weakened
between horses into the far turn, and was eased through the lane. MON DANSEUR trailed by a distanced, showed little, and was eased throughout.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN SWAGG set the pace along the inside, kicked away from pressing foes at the quarter pole, drew off under driving pressure through midstretch,
and was wrapped up through the final sixteenth. FIRE BLASTER stalked three wide, but quickly failed to keep pace with the leader at the quarter pole,
dueled outside of INTERACTIF MOMENT for place thereafter, forged that position at the furlong pole, and held. INTERACTIF MOMENT pressed the pace
setter from the outside while inside of FIRE BLASTER, proved no match for the leader entering the lane, but battled inside of the aforementioned rival for
place thereafter, but was bested. HARPER'S DEELITE chased from midpack two wide, shifted four wide entering the lane, but drifted to the five path in the
process, then failed to threaten. RAHFEES MAN saved ground far off of the pace, and failed to factor. TREVILION tracked along the inside, but weakened
without urging through the lane. GREELEY WENT WEST trailed throughout.

ALLIACEOUS settled off of the pace three wide, tracked the leaders four wide around the far turn, tipped five wide at the quarter pole, rallied outside of
rivals to bid for the lead outside of BLESSED ANNA, dueled with that foe through the late stages while being herded outwardly many paths, and edged an
advantage approaching the wire. BLESSED ANNA settled off of the pace along the inside, moved between horses into the far turn, stalked before splitting
the leaders two wide passing the quarter pole, forged an advantage inside of rivals approaching the furlong grounds as ALLIACEOUS loomed, lugged out
severely through the late stages while dueling with that foe, but was bested a few strides from the wire. MILA'S GOLD tracked two to three wide, ranged up
to the leading pair around the far turn, but was floated four wide entering the lane, completed a bid in upper stretch, but was outkicked by rivals on either
sides nearing the furlong grounds, flattened out, but held show from an inner rival. LIL ASHLEY B. broke slowly and trailed the field, inched closer three
wide around the far turn, tipped four wide in upper stretch, rallied while shifting inwardly through the final furlong, but missed reaching an outer rival for
show. BIRDIE CALL broke slowly, but shifted outside of foes to rush forward into the first turn, pressed the leader from the outside, vied around the far turn,
but drifted out a path entering the lane, got outkicked by rivals on either side at the three sixteenths pole, but was pinched and steadied when put to tight
quarters between those foes shortly after, and weakened. MI LIA stalked along the inside, but faded turning for home. NINE LINE BIND set the pace while
shifting from the three path to the two path around the first turn, encountered pressure from BIRDIE CALL thereafter, but weakened passing the quarter pole
after a pair of outer rivals made bids.

Footnotes
SWEET CONFUSION stalked along the inside, shifted three wide at the five sixteenths pole to commence a rally, took aim on a clear PALACE MAGIC
approaching midstretch, steadily advanced to bid at the sixteenth pole, forged an advantage shortly after, and drove clear. PALACE MAGIC bumped with an
inner foe at the start, prompted the pace four wide before clearing inner foes at the seven sixteenths pole, widened his advantage when let out at the quarter
pole, remained clear into the final furlong as SWEET CONFUSION pursued, but was challenged by that foe at the sixteenth pole, and got reeled in soon
after. HERE COMES LOVIE vied two wide and between horse early on, but failed to keep pace with an outer foe into the turn, stalked before proving no
match for that rival and an outer bidding foe at the quarter pole, then kept on to prove best of the rest. PI YO PRINCESS chased three wide, but failed to
factor. VEILS AND VOWS bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed the field four wide around the turn, and made little impact. TALENTED TAPPER vied
along the inside before failing to keep pace with an outer foe into the turn, stalked before chasing that rival turning for home, and weakened.

Footnotes
MISSION BELLE stalked two wide, vied around the far turn, forged an advantage under confident handling at the quarter pole, then kicked away under
driving pressure passing the furlong grounds. CLARA BELLE settled off of the pace along the inside, then two wide around around the far turn, rallied
behind the leading group nearing midstretch, split foes a sixteenth out, and prevailed for place. C C'S COWGIRL broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the
start, rated far off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn three wide, tipped four wide in upper stretch, and stayed on between horses through the final
furlong, but was outfinished by an inner foe for place. MARK WITH AN E was squeezed back between horses after breaking a step slowly, trailed the field,
took the far turn four wide before shifting five wide in upper stretch, then stayed on willingly outside of foes while chasing C C'S COWGIRL. EARLEY ROSE
laid off of the pace two wide, improved to a stalking position along the inside into the far turn, tipped outside of the leading pair at the three sixteenths pole,
but drifted outwardly shortly after, then drifted back inwardly from right handed pressure in midstretch, and wandered about before weakening. ECLIPSED
set the pace, vied inside of the eventual winner around the far turn, fought on through upper stretch after being headed at the quarter pole, but yielded at the
furlong grounds, and weakened. PINKABOO was difficult to load, then bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked the pace three to two wide, progressed
into the backstretch, pressed around the far turn under steady urging, then weakened in upper stretch, and was eased up through the final furlong. AUNT
RUTH stalked along the inside, chased down the backstretch, but wilted inside of rivals through the far turn.

Footnotes
COSMIC TRAIN broke slowly, saved ground while trailing, improved while cutting the corner entering the lane, tipped five wide in the final furlong, and wore
down stopping rivals in the final sixteenth before driving clear. BASTI BLUE stalked the run-off leader from the outside, took aim on that tiring foe around the
far turn, failed to seriously progress through upper stretch, reached that rival while flattening out in the final furlong, and was outkicked by an outer foe in the
closings stages, but saved place. RENATI sped clear, ran off to a wide lead down the backstretch, tired around the far turn, but held sway through upper
stretch, fended off rivals on either side into the final sixteenth, but was overhauled by an outer oncharging foe late. CHIEF KIMOSABI saved ground far off of
the pace, improved into the far turn, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the sixteenth pole while chasing, shifted outside of a trio of stopping foes shortly
after, and stayed on to miss reaching place. I LIKE DREAMING chased along the inside, but was outmoved by an outer foe around the far turn, kept on to
attempt a rail bid late, but lacked a finishing punch. GTUONE BUCK never got involved. NORTHERNREFLECTION tracked along the inside, but weakened
into the far turn. RUNWILDWITHDREAMS was done early.

Footnotes
JUST GUN IT tracked from midpack along the inside, surpassed an inner rival into the far turn to achieve a stalking position from the pocket, smoothly split
the leaders two wide entering the lane after SHAR'S TREASURE drifted, forged an advantage approaching the three-sixteenths, and drew off passing that
marker. FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN stalked two wide, shifted four wide into the backstretch to press the pace, tucked three wide while attempting a bid at the
five sixteenths pole, but was floated to the six path entering the lane, got outkicked by an inner foe in the process, then stayed on willingly to achieve place
at the furlong grounds. SHIPPINGPORT vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, shook away from those foes entering the lane, but was headed by a
bidding foe passing the quarter pole, yielded to that rival at the three sixteenths marker, then tired in the late stages, but saved show. VISION OF ANGELS
broke inwardly, tracked two wide, inched forward four wide around the far turn, then stayed on while chasing between horses through the final furlong.
SHAR'S TREASURE vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but drifted to the four path entering the lane, and chased thereafter. BRIAR JUMPER
laid off of the pace in the two path around both turns, then chased on his left lead through the lane without producing a bid. CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT broke a
step slowly and was pinched back between horses at the start, then saved ground while trailing, tipped two wide entering the lane, and improved in upper
stretch. DA GOLD ROOM broke outwardly, laid far off of the pace three wide, came into the lane five wide, and made little impact. LOOKIN HIGH settled at
the rear two wide, came into the lane four wide, and never got involved. ONE TIME GEM tracked along the inside, but faded into the far turn. MAXIMILIANO
prompted the pace three wide, but weakened between horses into the far turn.

Footnotes
GYPSY'S SOULMATE bobbled into an inner foe at the start, saved ground off of the pace, improved inside of foes turning for home to stalk behind the
dueling pair, tipped outside of them at the three sixteenths pole, bid approaching the final sixteenth, and drove clear. COACH HUDSON chased the dueling
pair from the outside, got floated four wide by an inner shifting foe at the three sixteenths pole, got outkicked by that rival shortly after, but kept on to claim
place while chasing him home. PRIMEINTERESTRATE dueled along the inside of FLUFFPOINT, got headed entering the lane, fought on thereafter, but
gave way to a pair of outer bidders in the final sixteenth. FLUFFPOINT dueled for the lead two wide, forged an advantage entering the lane, but failed to kick
on, hung then weakened between horses late. PERMANENTDETENTION saved ground far off of the pace, shifted from the two to the four path inside the
final furlong, and chased the leaders home. EL MIC TIESUN broke a step slowly before being bumped by an outer foe at the start, trailed the field, shifted to
the six path entering the lane, but failed to factor. OXBOW WIND broke a step slowly, tracked the pace five to four wide, but faded turning for home.
RIVER'S RAGING chased four wide and between horses early on, but weakened into the turn.
