Footnotes
AUTISM PRISM disputed the pace with MISCHIEVOUSOFFICER from off the rail, responded when set down for the drive and came back to best that rival
in the closing yards. MISCHIEVOUSOFFICER broke sharply to duel for the lead with the winner while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the
quarter, remained in control through mid-stretch and just failed to last. LIPSTICK LADY was away in good order to chase the leaders while racing four-wide
throughout and failed to gain on the top pair in the drive. DR GS SWEETIE was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and finished evenly. R
THING was off a step slow, lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CADILLAC MARGARITA settled off the leaders early,
moved five-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
L D' RADO GOLDRUSH broke sharply to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and drew off through the
lane with complete authority. HARRYKEEPTHECHANGE pressed the pace while racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive. FIGHT ME was
forwardly placed, saved ground through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. STARZAN was void of early foot, raced six-wide through the turn
and finished with some late run. SUNLAND STAR showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. WHATSITTOYA settled
off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened.

off as a handy winner. WIND TARTARE (FR) settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, was no match for the winner in the
drive but finished with good energy to gain the place. DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way in the drive. JUST
CLASSY raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. MS SALLY showed no early speed, raced three-wide
through the second turn, angled out in mid-stretch and was not a factor. BARONESS VONTRAPPE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through
the second turn and failed to rally. BOLD REY was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. LAST PUNCH

Footnotes
PRESS BRIEFING sprinted clear at once, was well rated through the back-stretch, responded when challenged nearing the half, re-cleared into the stretch
and drew off as a handy winner. CONQUEST COBRA lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady bid. OUT ON
SATURDAY was away in good order to chase the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to engage the winner nearing the half, vied and gave way in
the drive. ANGELO'S PRIDE lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn, reached a contending position but lacked the needed late
response. CHIEFTAIN'S LAD showed brief speed and weakened. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the
second turn and finished evenly late. PURELY POLITICAL showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.
MOONLIGHT BLUE was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. INDY'S OUTLAW raced off the pacesetters
early, moved three-wide through the second turn and weakened.
