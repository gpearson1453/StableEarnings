Footnotes
SQUARED STRAIGHT stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, was carried out through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and edged
away late. AWESOME IMAGE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run but could
not match strides with the winner late. SAVED BY ZERO sprinted clear at once, lugged out through the turn and gave way in the drive. GEORGIAN ROAD
settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. OUT FOR JUSTICE raced off the pacesetters early, moved
three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. I AM ALLTHATYOUARE lagged early, raced off the rail through the turn and did not menace. PUT YOUR
PANTS ON was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CAPITAL REEF lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn
and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
EVERYBODY DOES IT showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, responded when set down for the drive, was up in the closing yards to be
going away late. MISS KITNESS sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and yielded to the
winner late. TANAGER settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, reached a contending position but failed to gain late. AND I
KNOW lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the second turn, angled out with a furlong to run and finished evenly late. UNCHAINING MELODY (GB)
chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way after going three-quarters. WILLING TO BURN was away in good order to chase the leaders from
the inside and weakened after going six furlongs.

Footnotes
BLACKBERRY LISA was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up from between rivals nearing the three-sixteenths marker, bumped with both foes,
vied into deep stretch and gamely prevailed. LASTING LIGHT chased the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up in tandem with the winner to offer a bid
into the stretch, bumped with that foe, vied but could not get by that rival late. SASHAYING SIS sprinted clear at once, responded when challenged from
both sides nearing the three-sixteenths pole, was bumped and vied into deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. OLD TOY settled off the leaders early,
moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. SUPAH SISTA was off slow, lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. EMMA'S A BEAST was void of early foot, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and did not offer a bid. A CARD SHORT lagged
throughout. THE RIDER OF LASTING LIGHT LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST BLACKBERRY LISA CONCERING THE BUMPING AT THE
THREE-SIXTEENTHS POLE AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS CAUSED BY BOTH HORSES AND
MADE NO CHANGE.

GIANT PAYDAY was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn, remained inside for the drive and was up in the closing
yards. MY INDY pressed the pace while racing three-wide, responded when set down for the drive and finished well to just miss. FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM
was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths marker and just failed to last.
COURAGEOUS settled off the leaders throughout and finished evenly in the drive. LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR showed no early speed, raced four-wide
through the second turn and was not a factor. CLAVICHORD chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going five furlongs.

SECOND GRACE broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off with complete authority.
MULLIGAN was away in good order to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide but could not gain on that rival in the drive. SUNSHINE BEACH
was reserved just off the leaders from the inside throughout and lacked the needed late response. IT'S ALEXUS settled off the leaders from the inside,
angled out into the stretch and finished evenly. IN THE WIND was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and did
not offer a bid. STREET SONATA lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

HELLO HANDSOME pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole and was ridden out to increase
his advantage. CAPPER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but
finished well to gain the place. SHAKELAS DESTINY lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. TRACK
BOUND raced unhurried early, moved six-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. UNCONSCIOUS POWER sprinted clear at once, raced off the
rail while setting the pace and weakened after going three-quarters. INFATUATE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and
weakened. REDDISH was hard to rate, rushed to contention and weakened.

Footnotes
RED NOVA dueled for the lead from the inside with LOVELY LINDA, vied with that rival through a prolonged drive and edged away late. LOVELY LINDA
disputed the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way grudgingly to that rival in the drive. TRANS MISSISSIPPI settled off the leaders
early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with some late run. SUMMER LOVE was forwardly placed early,
moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. JACOMINA was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and was not
a factor. ORATORY GLORY lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, angled out approaching the stretch and did not offer a bid. TICO TIME was
never far back, raced three-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. SLEIGH RIDE settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and
gradually weakened. IN CLASS was off slow, showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
CANTERBURY GOLD was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, was well rated through the back-stretch, opened a clear margin
nearing the half and drew off through the lane as a handy winner. SEVEN POINTS was taken in hand early, saved ground through the second turn, angled
out in mid-stretch, moved between rivals late to gain the place. PLUMA chased the leaders while racing three-wide, was no match for the winner in the drive
and just missed for the place. UNUSUAL DANCER lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn and finished evenly late.
PREDETERMINATION was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened. ASEAAWINNER showed no early speed,
raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. EASY DOES IT was never far back, raced three-wide through the second turn and weakened.
BLUEGRASS RUN showed brief speed and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
