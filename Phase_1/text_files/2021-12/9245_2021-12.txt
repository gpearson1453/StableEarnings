stretch but was nailed. LADY MISTRESS rated three wide off the leaders then made a gradual late gain. ANGELSFOUR MICHELE saved ground
throughout and lacked a solid rally. JUST A DREAM led outside early, vied through the turn then faded. MISBEHAVING LADY flashed speed for a quarter
mile and gave way. GUNFIGHTER'S GIRL dropped back wide and was never in contention. WEDDINIGHTJITTERS chased near the inside and lacked a

Footnotes
FROSTED INDIAN set the pace on the inside, showed the way into the far turn, responded when roused, turned back a bid from EXIT RIGHT, pulled away
and was ridden out. EXIT RIGHT stalked the pace, moved up between rivals entering the far turn, loomed nearing the quarter pole, made a bid, then was no
match. DIGGERS DIAMOND stalked outside, chased the leaders on the far turn, weakened and bested the others. COMMISSIONER DAVE raced three
wide early, settled off the pace and passed tired rivals. ILOVECHARLYBROWN raced off the pace, three wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. LOAD UP
MOE raced off the pace inside and did not factor. TAINO tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn and gave way. WICK stumbled after the start, raced
two wide off the pace and did not factor.

rivals, faded on the final turn then came again for the place. ROLLS ROYCE JOYCE dropped back inside, bid into the stretch then flattened out. KIRTAN
rated at the back of the pack then made up ground inside while no threat. FINEST WORK prompted the winner in the two path then proved empty in the

UNCLE ERNIE dueled in the two path, shook loose into the stretch, quickly opened up and coasted home under wraps. MEET ME AT MUNDIS advanced
outside on the turn, continued well but proved no match for the winner. TUDOX EXPECTATIONS dropped back inside, angled out at the quarter pole and
closed well. BREEZY GUST broke slowest, rushed up to duel inside, empty in stretch. HOCKEY PUCK trailed early, moved up between rivals then gave
way. SARATOGA JACK chased wide within range then stopped abruptly.
