Footnotes
OSWALD COBBLEPOT chased the early pace then rallied two wide on the turn, drew off then was ridden out in the end while clearly much the best.
STEELY CAPER was allowed to settled then rallied inside on the turn, made a bid two wide but was no match for the winner in late stretch.
DOYOUKNOWMYNAME set the early pace while inside, was used up and gave way in the stretch. SON OF PREACHERMAN was unhurried early while
inside on the backstretch then was no threat in the stretch. CRAZY LOVER chased the pace while two wide, was used up and stopped. BACKSTAGE BUD
pressed the early pace while two wide, was used up then stopped. WRONG TURN was outrun and distanced in the stretch. J BOB was fractious in the gate
just as the gate opened, broke in a tangle causing the rider to lose his irons then was pulled up on the backstretch and walked off. A steward's inquiry was
held concerning the start of J BOB leaving the gate. After reviewing the film's, no action was taken.
