Footnotes
BOSSY SOUL showed speed three wide around the first turn, dueled inside COAL SHAFT up the backstretch, fought with that rival through the far turn and
into the stretch, shook free with three-sixteenths remaining and inched away. CONVINCE stalked along the inside then steered out early on the backstretch,
exited the far turn four to five wide, finished steadily through the lane but needed to find more in the final furlong. COAL SHAFT had speed five wide around
the first turn, dueled outside BOSSY SOUL, battled three to four wide into the stretch, lost contact with three-sixteenths remaining and faded out of
contention. GODDESS APHRODITE tracked in the two path through the early going, went three wide into the lane, tired in the drive and was eased in the
final furlong to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
BLACK STORM broke in and bumped rival, raced two wide leaving the backstretch then angled to the rail entering the turn, saved ground to the stretch,
rallied along the inside, dueled with ALLEVA in the final furlong and was all out to best the runner-up. ALLEVA dueled for the lead from outside, brushed
entering the turn, cleared in upper stretch, was soon met by BLACK STORM and dueled with that rival in the furlong grounds, finished gamely but was
edged at the wire. SATANTA got bumped from outside at the start, angled to the inside, was put in tight quarters and checked at the seven-sixteenths pole,
angled out to three path around the bend, moved out further in the drive and rallied for the show. STREET VISION chased off the rail, two to three wide on
the turn and got nailed at the wire for the show. J T'S A. T. M. dueled for the lead from inside, brushed with ALLEVA at the seven-sixteenths pole, battled
through the turn and gave way past the three-sixteenths pole. HOT PURSUIT well placed behind the top pair early, angled off the rail and came four wide
into the stretch and weakened. HAND-TIMED.

VISION broke out and bumped rival, set the pace under pressure form the outside, cleared at the halfway point, vied with a pair of rivals leaving the far turn,
lost command into the stretch and stayed on for the show. DADDYS SPECIALDARK shifted out at the start, showed speed and went four wide into the first
turn then angled down to the two path, pressed the pace from outside, chased past the half-mile pole, bid between foes at the five-sixteenths but weakened
in the lane. HUMBOLDT went four wide around the first turn, saved ground trailing the field to the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
UNDER THE STARS stalked the speed well off the rail, went four wide into the turn, moved out to the five path entering the stretch, reached the front in
midstretch and won going away under hand urging. MISS EVERYTHING was forwardly placed along the inside, steered off the rail around the bend, went
two wide into the lane and finished willingly to best the rest. COMEDIC sped clear to establish the front, led two then three wide around the turn, was
overtaken in midstretch and weakened to third. MANORELLI broke in and bumped rival at the start, swung out into the stretch and could not summon the
necessary bid. COLORATURA got bumped from outside at the start, chased three deep early, outside a rival on the turn, exited the bend four wide and
weakened. INDY'S STAR was off slow from the outside, traveled four deep early, came six wide into the stretch, moved inward in the drive and could not
rally. LUCY JANE chased between foes behind the leader up the backstretch, angled to the rail on the turn and faded out of contention. WAITING ON
WENDY raced in midpack early on off the inside, traveled between foes on the turn then five wide into the lane and lacked further response.
WEEMISSGRAMMY raced off the pace in the early going, raced three deep on the turn, six wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. SWEET HEIDELBERG
sat off the pace near the back of the pack, raced off the rail and left the turn four wide and failed to menace. MONGOLIAN DIAMOND got pinballed leaving
the gate, sat off the pace near the inside, came two wide into the stretch and made no impact. MISSING PENNY broke in and bumped both sides at the
start, went three wide into the drive and was not a factor.

wide and finished gamely three deep to the wire. FORE LEFT was up close three deep early, bid at the five-sixteenths and dueled four wide into the stretch,
