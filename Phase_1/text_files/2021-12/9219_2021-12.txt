Footnotes
MUCH CLASS went to the front, led throughout, saved ground, dueled late, drifted out, bumped, proved the best. TENSAS TODDY unhurried in the
beginning, moved up on the inside around the final turn, split rivals at the head of the stretch, dueled down the lane, drifted in, bumped late and proved
second best at the wire. GREELEY'S DEALER lacked early speed, had an outside trip, made a late gain and proved no match for the top two. UNWANTED
INTRUDER pressed the early pace, eased back and passed tired ones late. KRAFTY BOY raced within contention, made a bid and dropped back. MY
BOOK vied for the early advantage and faded around the final turn. MEDITATE void of early speed and was outrun. THE JOCKEY OF #3 TENSAS TODDY
LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #4 MUCH CLASS FOR INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED #4 FROM FIRST AND PLACED HIM SECOND.
