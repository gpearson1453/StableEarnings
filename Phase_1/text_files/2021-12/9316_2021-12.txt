VARSITY FLYGIRL sped clear into the first turn, opened up down the backstretch, and held sway safely through the lane. VEILAZIG stalked along the
inside, but failed to threaten the leader through the lane while holding place. MALARTACH raced in midpack two wide, tipped four wide entering the lane,
and claimed show. IZEONPOINT laid off of the pace two wide, then along the inside down the backstretch, and failed to factor. TWO WITH A TEN tracked
along the inside, tipped two wide into the backstretch, then three wide entering the lane, and faded. MAD TABBY never got involved. TWN TAWFEERS
PARTY showed little.

Footnotes
ORDER UP set the pace from a pressing rival into the turn, inched clear turning for home, drew off passing the quarter pole, and was driven into the final
sixteenth to seal the deal while hanging on his left lead. COURTMAN chased along the inside, vied inside of MAGIC LIGHTNING for place in upper stretch
without threatening the leader, dueled thereafter, brushed his counterpart a sixteenth out, then drifted a bit outwardly late while under left handed pressure
and prevailed. MAGIC LIGHTNING tracked four to three wide, vied for place outside of COURTMAN in upper stretch, dueled before being brushed by that
foe at the sixteenth pole, and got bested. AUTUMN'S SO FLASHY hopped at the start and was off poorly, raced far off of the pace around the turn, split foes
two wide at the furlong grounds, and moved up through the late stages. SCORING DRIVE sat reserved far off of the pace, cut the corner entering the lane,
and improved along the rail. PERRINS took the turn in the three path while off of the pace, shifted five wide entering the lane, improved outside of foes in
midstretch, but leveled off in the final furlong. DONT CROSS EL HEFE broke a half step slowly, laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the four path
entering the lane, and failed to factor between horses. BOLD DANCER pressed the pace setter from the outside, but failed to keep pace with that foe
passing the five sixteenths pole, and weakened at the quarter pole. MY MAN LOUIE stalked three to two wide and from between horses around the turn, but
failed to keep pace with those rivals turning for home, shifted four wide entering the lane, but caved without rider encouragement passing the quarter pole,
and was eased through the final furlong. ANYOTHERQUESTIONS was outrun and showed little.

Footnotes
FISH N CHICK set a clear pace, held sway from a chasing HIGHER NOTE through upper stretch, dug in as that foe menaced a sixteenth out, and lasted.
HIGHER NOTE stalked two wide as that leader's closest pursuer, chased that foe through upper stretch, produced a bid via a long drive in the final
sixteenth, but hung. ELI'S GIRL laid at the rear five to four wide, then moved up in midstretch. EXCEEDING was reluctant to load, then broke a step slowly
and trailed the field early on, improved along the rail at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to sustain that rail charge through the lane. TWIN CAUSE laid off
of the pace four to three wide, gained at the three furlong pole to claim show at the five-sixteenths, but tired between horses passing the furlong grounds.
SMART LUCKY LASS stalked three to two wide around the turn, but faded between horses at the five sixteenths pole. ORDER UP ANOTHER tracked four
wide, but faded between horses at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
BLOODLINE stalked two wide, vied at the three furlong pole, drove clear passing the quarter pole, dug in in midstretch as WE ALL SEE IT threatened, but
held gamely from that foe to the wire. WE ALL SEE IT laid off of the pace four wide around both turns, rallied entering the lane to bid outside of BLOODLINE
at the furlong grounds, but was kept at bay. ACHILLES HEEL settled off of the pace along the inside, waited behind traffic passing the quarter pole, altered
to the four path at the three sixteenths pole, and moved up. MR CREED trailed, took the far turn in the three path, shifted five wide entering the lane, and
finished up wilingly. RUSSIAN TANK stalked along the inside, failed to slip through a non-existent hole inside of the pace setter turning for home, hopped
over that foe's heels when getting too close entering the lane, and lacked a bid thereafter. PRACTICE SQUAD tracked three wide, pressed the leading pair
around the far turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. WALHALLA set a clear pace early on, met the eventual winner's bid at the three furlong,
got headed at the quarter pole, and weakened soon after.

STERLING MISS set a clear pace into the turn, drew off from a bidding foe entering the lane, dug in to meet READY FOR CHANGE's bid in the final
sixteenth, and held. READY FOR CHANGE rushed to be close up along the inside of the pace setter early on, switched out at the half mile pole to stalk that
foe from the outside, got floated three wide by an inner foe around the bend, but rallied through the lane to take aim on the clear leader, produced a bid in
the final sixteenth, but was denied. MERSEYSIDE raced off of the pace early on, swiftly advanced inside of foes passing the seven sixteenths pole, ranged
up outside of the leader at the five sixteenths marker, but faltered between horses at the quarter pole, and weakened on her left lead. AMEERAH B tracked
three to four wide, and failed to factor. VINCAIA broke through the gate pre-race, jogged for about a sixteenth of a mile before returning to the gate to be
reloaded, tracked the pace two wide early on, but was shuffled between horses into the turn when an inner READY FOR CHANGE vacated the rail, then
was done early.

TIZAFEELIN chased from off of the pace along the inside around the turn, inched closer tipping two wide entering the lane, grinded away in midstretch while
aiming to bid inside of the dueling pair, did so entering the final sixteenth, and forged an advantage approaching the wire. CURVETTE vied two wide, shifted
to the three path entering the lane as THE AURELIA FACTOR ranged up outside, dueled with that foe into the final furlong, but was surpassed by a rail
bidding foe in the final sixteenth, and prevailed in the battle for place. THE AURELIA FACTOR stalked while tipping outside of the leading pair into the turn,
sparked a duel while bidding for the lead outside of CURVETTE passing the quarter pole, but was bested by an inner rallying foe in the final sixteenth, then
got outdueled for place. SIENNA BREEZE tracked in the four path around the turn, but faded through the lane. MELODY ROSE never got involved. MIAMI
ROSE got outrun. BIZZY ECHO popped open the gate pre-race, then vied inside of CURVETTE around the turn, but weakened at the three sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
MALIBU MARIE laid close up along the inside of a pair of vying rivals around the first turn, forged an advantage from those foes passing the five furlong
pole, cleared at the three furlong pole as those rivals tired, met MEMPHIS CASH QUEEN's mild bid turning for home, but was set down at the
three-sixteenths, held sway from that rival into deep stretch, and widened through the final sixteenth. MEMPHIS CASH QUEEN stalked in the four to three
path around the first turn, tucked to the rail down the backstretch, tipped back three wide at the three furlong pole as MALIBU MARIE built a clear margin,
took aim on that foe turning for home, inched closer entering the lane, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, and proved second best. INTENSE
COMPANY (IRE) trailed along the inside, advanced inside of foes around the far turn to claim show at the five sixteenths pole, then failed to threaten the top
two through the lane while proving best of the rest. MARK WITH AN E laid off of the pace two wide, got hung four wide around the far turn, then failed to
factor while gaining a minor reward. DRESSEDTOIMPRESS settled off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn three wide and between horses, and
failed to make an impact. GOLDEN TWIST vied three wide, but weakened at the three furlong pole. JUNIE vied two wide and between horses around the
first turn, but was through after a half mile, weakened sharply into the far turn, pulled up in upper stretch when assisted by the outrider, then jogged back to
be unsaddled, and walked off.

Footnotes
FREE LIKE A GIRL stalked three wide and between horses, bid passing the quarter pole, led at the three-sixteenths, and drove clear entering the furlong
grounds. WHOLELOTTAMO chased along the inside, tipped three wide at the furlong grounds, and passed a pair of foes for place. SERAPE set the pace
inside of a vying WON DAY, but was outkicked by another foe at the three sixteenths pole, and kept on for a minor share. WON DAY vied for the lead two
wide, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the three sixteenths pole, and tired between horses in the final furlong. CUSTOM FOR TINA laid off of the pace in
the three to five paths around the turn, and failed to threaten. A G'S CHARLOTTE failed to factor. BASALT STREET stalked four wide, but weakened
without rider encouragement passing the quarter pole, and was eased thereafter.
