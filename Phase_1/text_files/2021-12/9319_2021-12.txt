PRINCE OF PORTLAND was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move nearing the turn, shook clear when straighten, then drew clear in the drive to
prove best, driving. FIVE STAR PHIL was rated along early and then made a three wide bid nearing the half mile marker, then vied for command with the
winner on the turn, but could not keep up with that rival in the stretch, while staying on to be clearly second best. CITIZEN'S FIRE was reserved early on the
inside, then eased off the inside on the turn and swung out seven wide leaving the turn and was along for the show award. CAIRO BOOGIE chased the
early pace on the inside and eased off the rail on the turn and was five wide by the quarter pole but came up empty in the drive. THE GHOST OF N Y was
reserved early while three wide and came four wide into the drive and offered no rally. BANDFROMTHEBAR dueled for the early lead three wide and
weakened. GUNHAND was settled while five wide and was four to five wide on the turn and had no response. OVER AND THUNDER rushed up the inside
to duel early and stopped.

SWING WEST was well placed early towards the inside, then made a two to three wide bid to vie for command between horses by the quarter pole, then
kicked clear leaving the three sixteenths and remained clear to prove best. EXTRA MEDIUM was reserved early on the inside, then came three wide into
the drive and shifted out four wide leaving the three sixteenths, then angled in by the furlong marker and rallied well late. HARD FOUGHT tracked the early
pace in between horses, made a three to four wide bid on the turn, kept on but needed more. BAPTIZE THE BOY tracked the early pace and made a four
wide bid on the turn but flattened out. FEDERALE was sent to the front to set the pace and move to the inside, then vied for command by the quarter pole
and weakened. CHRISATUDE chased the early pace five wide, then was five to four wide on the turn and had no rally. DR. DEVERA'S WAY was settled

Footnotes
QUALY set the early pace while racing near the inside, then came off the inside leaving the turn while clear, then wandered nearing the sixteenths pole,
then was corrected with a right handed pop with the riding crop, held on late to prove best. CANDY LIGHT tracked the early pace from between rivals, then
was shuffled back on the turn, was on the inside by the quarter pole, swung out three wide for the drive, closed well late to just miss. DANCE ROUTINE
stalked the early pace five wide, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole, continued that bid and was herded by the winner by the sixteenths pole and hung
late. I CAN RUN was well placed on the inside and made a bid on the inside on the turn but needed more. DETERMINED EMPIRE was rated early but
lacked the needed stretch bid. DETERMINED GOLD passed the tiring rivals. MISS KEEN lacked a rally. DERWIN'S STARLET tracked the early pace in
between horses, then chased the pace on the turn and tired. OCEAN TIME chased the early pace six wide and was five to six wide on the turn and stopped.
