Footnotes
YOUREOUTOFCONTROL set a pressured pace inside, yielded the edge past the quarter pole and contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the
turn, recovered the lead at the eighth pole, dueled clear mid-stretch and widened later yards. RICHIE'S B L engaged in close chase, raced near the rail on
the turn then dug in from the head of the lane to take second the final strides. TANELEER pressured the pace between horses and put a head in front past
the quarter pole, contested the edge two deep on the turn, ceded the advantage to Youreoutofcontrol at the eighth pole, continued close through the upper
stretch but relented to that one mid-stretch and was nipped from second the final strides. D TACHYON chased the pace then clipped the heels of Doesn't
Make Cents approaching the quarter pole, quickly recovered stride in the three path past the pole and dug in through the stretch to finish well. RUN RABBIT
hopped at the break then angled to the outside to give chase, raced in the seven path of the turn and finished well outside. PAID HOLIDAY pressured the
pace between horses, raced close three wide through the turn then drifted into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. TAPPING gave chase outside,
raced in the five path of the turn then weakened. DOESN'T MAKE CENTS chased toward the outside, had his heels clipped nearing the quarter pole then
faded through the turn. After posting the inquiry, the Stewards reviewed the heel clipping incident nearing the quarter pole and found no change necessary.

Footnotes
OUT OF ROMANCE took the lead at the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure into the far turn, widened at the
rail and was steadily handled to hold on. MAGNOLIA MADAME settled just off the pace, started a three wide bid at the five sixteenths pole, dug in leaving
the far turn and finished well at the outside withers of the winner. CELESTIAL DIVA stalked the winner two deep past the five eighths pole, challenged that
one nearing the five sixteenths pole, dropped back into the far turn but dug in through the stretch to hold onto third. AMARETTO SOUR rated off the pace
and off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, angled out toward the head of the lane and left the turn about
the five path then outfinished for third later yards. MAGNIFICENT ROCKET checked in tight at the rail at the inside flank of Amaretto Sour midway through
the opening turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then drifted into the stretch and showed little more. FORT
ZANNA rounded the opening turn in the four path and showed little response through the backstretch. PLAY CHARADES raced off the pace and off the rail
and showed little response.

LONG LEGS LOUISE raced with the early pace two deep and moved to near even terms into the backstretch, dueled close from that point and took control
toward the five sixteenths pole, was pressured to widen at the rail through the far turn then kept alert to further her lead in the stretch. WOODSONG'S
CASTLE saved ground off the pace the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and dueled to
take second mid-stretch. CARNIVAL LUCKY was hustled at the rail through the front stretch and set the pace into the first turn, dug in to the challenge of
Long Legs Louise into the backstretch, gave up the lead to that one toward the five sixteenths pole, dropped back approaching the quarter, yielded second
mid-stretch but held on for third. TAPTAP settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn, started a three wide bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded
the far turn two deep then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. DRIVEN TO SUCCEED raced well off the pace and showed little response through the
backstretch. LAURA'S GRAND stalked the earlier pace three wide, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then faded through the backstretch.
CLASSY JEAN drifted to the seven path into the first turn and raced wide into the backstretch.

AMIDSHIPS took quick control and rated a slim early lead inside, was met nearing the half mile pole, dueled WINDSORS TAIL from that point and
contested the rail on the far turn, drew clear into the lane and was steadily handled to hold on well, while the latter stalked the early pace then moved to
even terms nearing the half mile pole, dueled the winner from that point and contested the far turn two deep, but dropped back into the stretch and had to
settle for second. BLUE N GOLD rated close inside the first turn, picked up the chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn at the rail then dug in from
the head of the lane to take third later yards. PENGUIN PARADE settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, continued
off the rail on the far turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. FOURDIAMONDSPLEASE stalked from the three and four paths the first turn, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then weakened the final furlong. HAPPY YEARS settled off the early pace in the three path,
ran outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase at the seven sixteenths pole, though, weakened in the four path of the far turn.

Footnotes
LETTS GO TO DIXIES entered the first turn in the four path then stalked two deep past the five eighths pole, took the lead toward the seven sixteenths,
drew clear approaching the far turn and widened at the rail through the turn, and was steadily handled through the lane. HOWSAFEAREMYCOLORS setled
off the rail the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, eased outward on the far turn and left the turn in the five path, then dug in through the
stretch to take second later yards. CHEESE LOUISE saved ground just off the early pace, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the
rail on the far turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. MY DREAM GIRL raced well back in the four path the opening turn, left the turn outside and picked
up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, eased out into the stretch and showed little more. SASSY BABE angled to the
inside to set the early pace, was caught nearing the seven sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point, rounded the far turn at the rail then weakened.
RHYTHM TREE saved early ground, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the six and seven paths and showed little more.
NEEDACARCALLLOUIE saved ground and showed only mild response through the backstretch. MASHUGANA rounded the first turn about the five path
then stalked into the backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, but weakened in the three path of the far turn. WALKIT LIKE I
TALK raced well back mostly saving ground. BAHAMA BREEZE showed no response through the backstretch, was eased leaving the quarter pole,
unsaddled just past the wire then collapsed behind the horse ambulance.
