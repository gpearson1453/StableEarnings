Footnotes
GUITAR SLIM stalked the clear leader from the outside, chased that foe without progressing through midstretch, but gained as that rival tired in the final
furlong, and caught him on the wire. SOCIAL MISFIT came out soon after the start to dissuade others to go forward, interfered BINDING in the process,
cleared off into the first turn, remained clear from a chasing GUITAR SAM into the final furlong, but hit a wall in the late stages, and was nailed on the wire.
BINDING stumbled at the start before steading in tight quarters between horses soon after, trailed the field due to the incident, improved between horses
down the backstretch, progressed while chasing the top pair into and around the turn, shifted outside of those foes entering the lane, but flattened out in
upper stretch, and failed to threaten late. TUNE MY GUITAR steadied when put to tight quarters between horses soon after the start, then saved ground off
of the pace, and failed to factor. STAR BANJO tracked three wide, but was done early. TAKING NOTES bumped an inner foe soon after the start, laid off of
the pace four wide around the first turn, but was through after a half mile.

Footnotes
MOMENT OF STARDOM rated comfortable off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the two path before tipping four wide entering the lane,
rallied outside of foes to range up to the leaders leaving the furlong grounds, forged an advantage a sixteenth out, and drove clear. CHARLIE G tracked two
wide, tipped three wide entering the lane, grinded away through upper stretch before brushed and forced back to his left lead approaching the furlong pole,
sustained a bid passing that marker as MOMENT OF STARDOM rallied alongside, but was outkicked by that foe at the sixteenth pole. APACHE TEARS set
the pace inside of a pressing rival, dug in at the quarter pole, gamely resisted bids into the final furlong, but yielded to a pair of outer rivals a sixteenth from
home. EVERLOVINGHAND stalked along the inside, but lacked racing room along the rail to slip inside of the leaders passing the quarter pole, waited until
attempting to split those foes at the furlong grounds, but that hole was short-lived and closed passing that marker, then chased through the final furlong.
PORT O' CALL settled far off of the pace in the two to three paths around the turn, cut the corner turning for home to improved inside of a rival in upper
stretch, then shifted three wide approaching the furlong grounds, and stayed on to miss reaching show. ENCHANTED MOON prompted the pace two wide,
bid for the lead at the quarter pole, vied while hanging on his left lead, but drifted outwardly from left handed pressure passing the three sixteenths pole,
brushed an outer foe before shifting back inwardly at that junction, and weakened between horses shortly after. JOEBOY laid off of the pace three wide, and
weakened in upper stretch. JUDGMENTAL showed little.

Footnotes
MARTINIZED tracked along the inside, stalked around the far turn, but checked briefly behind the leading pair turning for home, tipped outside of them at
the three sixteenths, shot past them at the furlong grounds, and drove clear before being eased up through the final sixteenth. SEEHOSS vied inside of
OUR BLUE JAY, turned that foe away as MARTINIZED bid at the three sixteenths pole, but quickly proved no match, then held place thereafter. OUR BLUE
JAY vied for the lead three to two wide, then from between horses at the three sixteenths pole, but offered little resistance to his outer counterpart's bid
passing that marker, and gave way. WAR SAVVY stalked the leaders two to three wide, pressed into the far turn, but faded in upper stretch, but saved
fourth. WISH UPON A STAR trailed around both turns, then improved in the final sixteenth to just miss a minor placing. YOUR TIME'S COMING tracked
three to four wide, but weakened entering the lane.

DOWAGIAC CHIEF set the pace, felt stern pressure from TOMMY BEE as that foe bid around the far turn, but shook clear of that rival in upper stretch, and
drew off under driving pressure before being wrapped up through the final sixteenth. TOMMY BEE pressed the pace setter from the outside, ranged up to
bid around the far turn, but was repelled in upper stretch, drifted outwardly at the furlong grounds while proving no match, but flopped back to his left lead
when the rider went to right handed pressure, and secured place. GRAEL bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked the pace three wide around the first
turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader duo while chasing outside of TUANIS around the far turn, then reached that rival for show late while not
threatening the winner. TUANIS stalked along the inside, but chased the leading pair around the turn before tiring through the lane. COUNTRIFIED minorly
bumped with an inner foe at the start, and got outrun.

SOUL STREIT showed the way early on, inched clear from stalking foes into the turn, then drew further away from them entering the lane, widened under
driving pressure through midstretch, and was wrapped up late. SCHMOOZIN lagged well behind the field around the turn, then chased along the rail to
surpass a pair of outer foes tor place in the final sixteenth. POPULIST stalked the clear leader two wide around the turn, but failed to keep pace with that foe
entering the lane, and tired between horses in the late stages, but saved show. FROLIC MORE stalked three wide, but failed to produce a bid before tiring.

Footnotes
NEW YEAR SURPRISE tracked three wide, decidedly split the leading foes two wide to produce an early bid at the nine sixteenths pole, drew off into the far
turn, widened around that bend and through upper stretch, held safely from a chasing SAILOR'S RETURN while tiring in the final furlong, but lasted to the
wire. SAILOR'S RETURN trailed into the far turn, rallied four wide turning for home, claimed place in upper stretch while in pursuit of the clear leader,
narrowed that tiring foe's margin through the final furlong, but could not reel that rival in. JIMMY DAN settled off of the pace along the inside, gained three
wide turning for home to bid for place, but was outkicked for that position by an outer rival in upper stretch, then kept on to secure show. SURVEILLANCE
stalked in the two path around the first turn, then two wide around the far turn while failing to keep pace with the clear leader, but was outkicked by outer
foes in upper stretch, and lacked a bid. DOVER STRAIT tracked along the inside, tipped two wide turning for home to surpass a tiring rival, but failed to
factor. FLYING FRED set the pace along the inside, met the winner's premature bid at the nine sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with that rival into
the far turn, and tired around that bend. INFLUENTIAL stalked the leader from the outside while intently staying a path away from that rival around the first
turn, which allowed NEW YEAR SURPRISE to split him and his inner counterpart at the nine sixteenths pole, then weakened into the far turn, and was done
early.

Footnotes
STRUMMER set the pace along the inside, was set down passing the quarter pole as SPIRITED BEAUTY gave chase, and held sway from that rival
through the final furlong. SPIRITED BEAUTY stalked the leader from the outside, but chased that foe while under strong urging around the far turn, failed to
progress in upper stretch as the leader's only pursuer, grinded away at that foe's margin in the late stages, but was second best. HOTMOLLY stalked along
the inside, but failed to keep pace with the leading pair turning for home, then kept on through the lane to hold show. EXPLOSIVELY HOT saved ground off
of the pace, shifted two wide entering the lane, and improved without threatening. TECATE TIME tracked the pace two wide, shifted three wide entering the
lane, and faded. ABIGAIL'S BEAUTY laid off of the pace two wide, and never got involved. GATOR PROUD was outrun.

Footnotes
BROOKE MARIE settled off of the pace two wide, gained four wide turning for home, tipped five wide and outside of foes in upper stretch, rallied through the
final furlong, surged in the closing stages, and got up on the wire. ELLE Z set the pace along the inside, dug in to resist ELLE'S TOWN's bid turning for
home, gamely repelled that foe at the furlong grounds, inched clear shortly after, but was nailed on the wire by an outer oncharging rival. KELA'S TURN
tracked along the inside, but was outmoved by an outer foe entering the lane, shifted five wide in midstretch, and rallied between rivals to reach show on the
wire. ELLE'S TOWN stalked three four to three wide into the turn, bid outside of ELLE Z turning for home, vied with that foe through upper stretch, but was
repelled at the furlong grounds, weakened, and got nailed on the wire for show. LOVE AND MONEY stalked two wide, got keen while tucking to the inside at
the half mile pole, tracked along the inside around the turn, then sustained chasing position through upper stretch while shifting three wide, but lacked a
closing kick in the final furlong. GHOSTING KIM settled at the rear, got caught four wide around the turn, shifted to the six path entering the lane, then to the
eight path in upper stretch, and stayed on outside of foes, but leveled off late. ADVOCATING bumped with an outer foe at the start, laid far off fo the pace
two wide, came into the lane between horses, and improved minorly. YES IT'S GINGER hit the inner part of the gate while breaking slowly, recovered to
track two wide, gained three wide around the turn, tipped four wide entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer foe in upper stretch, and faltered
through the final furlong. INAJIFFY bobbled before bumping with an inner foe at the start, raced at the rear two to three wide and between horses, but never
got involved. FIDUCIARY (GB) was outrun along the inside. SHORT SUMMER DRESS pressed the pace three to two wide and from between horses into
the turn, but failed to keep pace with those rivals turning for home, then weakened between horses in midstretch.

Footnotes
WIN YA WIN tracked from midpack three wide, tipped five wide in upper stretch, rallied on his left lead to bid at the sixteenth pole, and drove clear. GRAVY
HOUND set the pace along the inside, met C'MON VE's bid at the three furlong pole, repulsed that foe at the quarter pole, held sway into the final furlong,
but was bested by an oncharging rival passing the sixteenth pole, and held place. BIG BELLA BROWN was bumped between horses at the start, stalked
along the inside, chased the clear leader through upper stretch before tipping outside of that rival at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer foe
shortly after, then failed to reach the early pace setter for place while holding show. DOUBLE BARREL MAN trailed two wide, shifted four wide entering the
lane, surpassed inner foes before diving to the rail passing the furlong pole, then slipped inside of foes late, bid for show inside of BIG BELLA BROWN, but
was denied reaching that rival. LIKE MIKE saved ground far off of the pace, then improved along the rail through the lane. WAR COUNT settled two wide,
shifted three wide in upper stretch, and improved between horses. C'MON VE stalked two wide, bid for the lead at the three furlong pole, vied turning for
home, but was repelled at the quarter pole, chased into the final furlong, but weakened late. DIXIE STREET laid off of the pace four wide, shifted six wide in
upper stretch, but failed to factor. HALFMOON REEF was brushed by an inner foe at the start, chased the pace two wide, shifted four wide entering the
lane, but tired. SOUL SONG broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted two wide in upper stretch, but
weakened between horses at the furlong grounds.
