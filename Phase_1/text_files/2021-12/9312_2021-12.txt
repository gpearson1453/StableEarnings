moved up in the stretch run. INSIDE THE CIRCLE inside speed to the front, stayed to stretch, wilted late. J J'S SOLUTION raced evenly of rail to turn, no

never in contention. ROYNE inside run to quarter pole to contend, folded in the stretch run. JERRID never menaced. JUULSTONE to the front around first
