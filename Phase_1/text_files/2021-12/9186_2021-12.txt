Footnotes
JOJOMAR was well rated early, made a three wide bid on the turn, hit the front leaving the quarter pole, then was given a couple right handed pops with the
riding crop nearing the furlong marker and drew off while being ridden out through the final furlong. MIDDLE EARTH was allowed to settle early, advanced
on the turn and came four wide into the drive, finished willingly while no match for the winner, second best. MACHO SMOKE was slow into stride, then
advanced on the inside on the turn, angled out by the three sixteenths and had a belated rally. COOS BAY dueled for the early lead and made a three wide
bid on the turn and set the pace by the five sixteenths, then was headed by the quarter pole and weakened. MR CLIPBOARD lacked a rally. ROYAL KAZ
dueled for the early lead two wide and weakened. DREAMING OF LOVE pressed the early pace on the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
PROMISE OF JOY prompted the pace and made a four wide bid leaving the quarter pole, drew clear the final furlong to prove best under a drive. QUEEN'S
DREAM was allowed to settle early, advanced six wide by the quarter pole, rallied well late for the place award. ARTEMIS RISING rushep on the inside and
set the pace while racing off the inside, continued in the three or four path off the turn and weakened final furlong. ABOVE THE LINE chased the early pace
five to four wide and faded in the drive. MAGICALLYDELICIOUS lacked a rally. TOUCH ME NOT was void of early speed, came seven wide into the drive
and passed the tiring rivals. COUNTESS SHANAKILL had no rally. LUCKY DAY DIVA was allowed to settle three wide then dropped down to the inside on
the turn and weakened. COWGIRL NIGHT was off slowly then was no factor.

Footnotes
GOLDEN CANDY vied for the early lead from between rivals, made a bid leaving the five sixteenths to gain a short lead, then drew off in the drive to prove
much the best while being ridden out, wrapped up late. TRENDING UP was reserved early, was five wide by the quarter pole while unwinding his rally,
finished well on the outside while no match to the winner, second best. TANKINATOR chased the early pace from the inside, then came off the inside to
begin a rally nearing the five sixteenths, got into tight quarters, then finished willingly in the stretch to best the rest. DON'T LOSEMYMONEY vied for the
lead on the inside and weakened. SUNSHINE MAX stalked the pace and made a five wide bid on the turn to loom boldly but came up empty in the drive.
DAKOTA OUTLAW chased the early pace three wide, then checked around the five sixteenths while in tight, weakened. FLASHINTHENIGHT vied for the
early lead four wide and weakened. The rider on DAKOTA OUTLAW claimed foul versus TANKINATOR and SUNSHINE MAX for interference on the turn,
after the STEWARDS reviewed the replays the objections were not allowed and the race was left as is.

wide, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole and led briefly leaving the turn, then was passed by the furlong marker, but kept on to the wire and was
gaining late. NARMER was reserved early, advanced five wide on the turn, came six wide jiknto the drive and rallied well late to gain the show award.

Footnotes
SISTER SADIE pressed the early pace three wide, made a bid on the turn, then dueled inside of CAPRICHOSA by the quarter pole and had a long drive
with that rival, then prevailed late under a drive. CAPRICHOSA stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn, dueled for command on the
outside of the winner by the quarter pole, but hung late, second best. LET'S GO DANZING chased the early pace three wide, shifted out four wide by the
three sixteenths and lacked the needed bid. SMART TART was reserved early, advanced five wide on the turn, came six wide into the drive and had no
later rally. LOLA GIRL diueled for the lead between rivals and weakened. MISS JUNEBUG was bumped soundly at the start, failed to menace. SINFUL
BEAUTY dueled for the early lead on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
YOU'VE GOT MALE tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, then had a long drive with HOLD THE IRISH, edged clear of that rival
late to prove best under a drive. HOLD THE IRISH set an unchallenged pace on the inside, then was headed on the turn, had a long drive with the winner in
the drive, faded late while staying on to finish on even terms for the place award. PAINT MUSIC FOR ME was off slowly, then was rated along four wide,
made a four wide bid on the turn to loom boldly, but had no punch in the drive while needing more, got up to finish on even terms for the place award.
JOZANI R V F was void of early speed, came five wide into the drive and offered a late rally. BOSSY CAT chased the early pace, then was in contention by
the quarter pole, altered course in the furlong grounds and had no kick. JASPER K chased the early pace and tired.
