Footnotes
I'M LOOKING UP went to the front, came in early, took the lead around the turn and drove clear down the stretch. COCO TIGER vied for the early lead,
saved ground around the turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. LIMBO'S PROMISE lacked early speed, made a steady gain and
got up for third. POLO ART raced within striking distance, eased back, made a late mild bid, finishing wide, but was no factor. I'LL RAISE YOU raced in the
rear in the beginning and passed tired ones. JAKE THE BAND MAN brushed at the start, raced within contention, saved ground around the turn and faded.
CURTIN'S UP had a tight start, raced near the back and was never close. RUSTY CAGE brushed start, tight quarters, rushed up, challenged for the early
advantage and dropped back. THE JOCKEY OF #5 CURTIN'S UP LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #6 I'M LOOKING UP FOR INTERFERENCE IN
THE EARLY GOING. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

GIRL THIRSTY raced within contention, came around the first turn on the outside, moved up, between rivals around the second turn, rallied from the outside
down the stretch and got up before the wire. HONEST WOMAN raced within striking distance, made a late bid and was outfinished. HARLANS WARRIOR
vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, took the advantage down the final stretch, but was outfinished by the top two. FIANNA HILLS dueled on
the front end, saved ground around the second turn and weakened. HAPPY SONRISA raced near the back in the beginning, moved up, within contention,
then faded and was no threat late. HONEST N LUCKY lunged at the start, raced in the back and was never close. PANTERITA broke poorly, racing in the
rear and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CAJUN BERTI vied for the early lead, saved ground around the turn and drove clear late. PIONEER PRIDE dueled on the front end, forwardly placed
throughout, was outfinished for the win, but held on for second. MY FORTUNATE SON lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn, made a late rail
bid and was outfinished for show. THIRTYEIGHT raced within striking distance, saved ground around the turn, lacked a late kick and missed show. STORM
THE FIELD raced near the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. SUGARLAND EXPRESS raced in the middle of the pack, came around the turn
on the outside and finished evenly. DAVID'S GRACE lacked early speed and was never a factor. SHADY MONKEY pressed the early pace and was
finished early. WICKED FITZ hesitated at the start, raced in the rear and was never close. LUCKY PEGASUS always raced near the back and showed little.

APRIORITY LADY went to the front, drove clear, saved ground, was collared down the home stretch by SIMPLE SUNDAY, but drove clear again before the
wire. SIMPLE SUNDAY raced within contention, made a bid around the final turn, dueled down the lane, was outfinished for the win, but proved an easy
second. OUR LITTLE GIRL raced near the middle of the field, came around the final turn wide, made a bid and proved no match for the top two. CUSTOM
MADE pressed the early pace, had an outside trip and lacked a late kick. STORM BREACH was an early factor, weakened and was no threat late.
KAITLYN'S COURT void of early speed, improved position, finished wide and was no factor. TRACK QUEEN raced in the middle of the pack, saved ground
around the second turn and weakened. LAST GHOST void of early speed and showed little. MY DEPOSIT always raced near the back and was outrun.
GABI'S GOLDENHEART raced in the middle of the field and dropped back.

made a late gain, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. BROAD DECISION lacked early speed, came around the turn wide, made a late
rally and finished willingly. I'M A SPECIAL STAR dueled on the front end and lacked a finish. KENSLEY'S HIPPIE vied for the early lead, saved ground
around the turn and weakened. SUNNYONASTORMYDAY raced near the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. PRAY IDE SING pressed the
early pace and faded. CHASIN GRACIE had an awkward start and was never a threat. SPREAD THE FAITH raced in the middle of the field, saved ground
