Footnotes
GRAPE THERAPY bumped with a rival at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, took the lead passing the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch
under a drive, responded well under pressure in the stretch and just held under strong urging. INOUAINTALKINTOME chased the pace down the
backstretch, drafted behind horses in the two path on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, dropped to the rail coming to the quarter-pole, came under
a drive into upper stretch, pursued the leaders into the final furlong then moved out, gained into the final sixteenth and just missed while narrowly able to get
the place. LOVE'S MISERY was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, made a rail bid at the five-sixteenths, fought on well in the stretch
and just missed while able to get the show. REELEY PSYCHED settled under some urging, went two then three wide on the turn, steadied behind horses in
upper stretch, raced towards the inside under a drive into the final furlong, moved out while gaining late and improved position. NEW YORK BANKER was
reluctant to load then last to commence, settled just off the pace on the outside, tracked four wide on the turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch and
lacked the needed kick. SPILL THE TEA broke out and bumped with a foe, was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn and lacked the needed
response. BARREL OF BLISS was hustled to the lead, set the pace under pressure, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage passing the
five-sixteenths and tired. MILL STONE CREEK smashed through the front of the gate prior to the start but was caught impressively by the starter then
brought back around and reloaded, broke in then was hustled, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch, drifted in late and was no factor.

Footnotes
AWESOME INDRA showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to her inside, vied in the two path early on the turn then dropped to the rail, kicked
clear when set down in upper stretch, passed the furlong marker under a right-handed crop, had the rider lose the crop when attempting to switch it to the
left-hand outside the sixteenth-pole, drifted out while having the reins shaken at her into the final sixteenth and proved best. SWEET MIA pressed the pace
on the inside of a foe, dropped back along the rail at the seven-sixteenths, shifted three wide inside the five-sixteenths, chased the winner in the stretch and
was second best. BIG AL'S GAL tracked the pace on the outside, issued a challenge in the three path at the seven-sixteenths then dropped to the two path,
lost touch with the winner under a drive in upper stretch and weakened but was clear for the show. SHASTA STAR was sent hard from the start, chased the
pace down the backstretch, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. STEFANIE ON
FLEEK was last to commence, moved out while urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn and came up empty. STARSHIP REINA
settled just off the pace, raced under some restraint passing the nine-sixteenths, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and
faltered.

Footnotes
A RING THING broke out at the start, went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside to the two path on the turn,
responded well when set down into upper stretch, drew off under the crop into the final sixteenth, was flagged with the crop into the final forty yards then
was eased up while much the best. SCOTT ALAIA settled just off the pace, brushed with a foe outside the half-mile pole, shifted from the inside to the two
path early on the turn, moved to three wide late on that bend, pursued the winner into upper stretch and proved no match while able to secure the place.
HAPPYLIFE was bumped very hard between horses at the start, settled near the back, was caught seven wide early on the turn then dropped to the four
path near the three-eighths and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. SPEED ZONE broke out and bumped very hard with a foe, raced just off
the pace between horses, brushed with an opponent outside the half-mile pole then dropped back, moved from the four path to the two path early on the
turn, shifted three wide around the five-sixteenths and came up empty. CREATIVE LEGACY was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace,
dropped from six to four wide on the turn and failed to respond. LUCKY SITKA veered in at the start then bumped hard with a rival and bobbled, settled at
the rear, went three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, drifted in outside the furlong marker and was no factor. HORSESHOE FALLS
dropped back near the half-mile pole then moved out, was caught five wide early on the turn then dropped to the rail and had nothing left. TOOTSIE'S
SONG broke in and bumped very hard with a foe, tracked then chased the pace on the outside, dropped back three wide on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
EXOTIC WEST settled just off the pace between horses, drafted in the two path early on the turn, dropped back nearing the five-sixteenths then was asked
while shifting four wide, rallied outside into upper stretch, closed strongly to get the lead at the furlong marker, edged clear outside the sixteenth-pole and
just held under strong urging. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN bumped the hindquarters of his inside neighbor at the start then was slow into stride, dropped well
behind early, passed foes while angling from three to five wide on the turn, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed well to just miss while clear for the
place. MY GIRL LEXI tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased three wide on the turn, pursued the leaders under a drive into the final furlong and
weakened. BLUSHABLE settled just off the pace, chased inside to the two path on the turn and lacked the needed kick. CADEAU DE PAIX settled just off
the pace on the outside, advanced four wide early on the turn, dropped to the three path while taking the lead coming to the five-sixteenths then the two
path later on that bend, moved clear under a right-handed crop at the quarter-pole, was collared into the final furlong and also weakened. KERIK was
coaxed along towards the rear on the far outside, went five then six wide on the turn and was no factor. GHOSTGHOSTGHOST settled towards the back,
was urged along in the two path on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MATOULA set the clear pace, vied in the two path on
the turn, lost the lead outside the five-sixteenths, dropped to the rail while falling back and faded. PADDY'S PRINCESS was bumped in the hindquarters at
the start, settled just off the pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC TIGER bumped with a rival and was off slow, was urged along on the outside, advanced outside the half-mile pole, went four wide on the turn,
rallied in the stretch, closed strongly in a prolonged drive and went past the embattled leaders late to prevail. TAMBURRO'S SOX chased the pace on the
outside, made a bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the two to three path on the turn, took a short lead inside the five-sixteenths, dueled with TOUGH
WORKOUT in the stretch, bested that foe for the place but was caught by the winner. TOUGH WORKOUT was sent hard to the lead, showed the way down
the backstretch, was challenged near the half-mile pole, vied inside on the turn, dueled with the runner-up in the stretch and missed while clear for the show.
OUT OF THE BREECH was forced out at the start then bumped with a foe, raced towards the rear under urging, went three wide on the turn, came four
wide into the stretch then angled to the far outside and improved position to garner the last spot in the superfecta. WAR NOVEL broke in then was hustled,
settled under some urging, went four then five wide on the turn and lacked the needed kick. JACK'S DREAM was urged along off the pace, went three to
four wide while between foes on the turn and failed to rally. FORESTWOOD LANE was ridden along off the pace, went four wide while between foes on the
turn and was no factor. KISSES FOR VAL was urged along near the middle of the field, raced inside to the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed response. UNLIKELY raced well back on the outside, went five wide on the turn and also was no factor. CROCK OF GOLD
bumped with a rival at the start, was ridden along off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and failed to respond. HANGOUT broke out at
the start, was ridden along off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn and came up empty. NAPOLEON COMPLEX bumped with a rival at the start,
was ridden along off the pace, went three wide between foes on the turn and also failed to threaten. BELL BOY was taken up a bit at the start then slow into
stride, dropped well behind, saved ground on the turn and never reached contention. GREY QUEST broke in at the start, was well placed towards the front,
dropped back along the rail on the turn and retreated.
