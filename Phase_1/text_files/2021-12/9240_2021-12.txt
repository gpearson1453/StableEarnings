Footnotes
NEBULI broke sharp to the front between horses, set a well measured pace throughout, much the best. BODACIOUS BABY antsy in the gate, lunged at the
beak, allowed to settle, rallied outside into turn while no match for winner after an eventful beginning. ANOTHER FLAT DRUNK inside speed, tried to keep
up, angled out, no late gain. KRISPY RICE slow into stride no speed to turn, back behind horses while full of run, had to angle out widest into the turn for
clear run and ran on well to finish up in good order after a rough trip. EMOTIONAL INTEL raced evenly with no response when needed. PAPPYSAYSYES
throwing head in gate, unprepared for the break, secured good position early on never far back, ran into trouble into the turn, steadied along inside and
failed to respond when clear. LITTLE JUDY B unruly in gate, broke well outside, chased winner but used up. EYEOFTHEBEHOLDER was through early and
dropped back. FOUND MY THRILL good position to the turn, nothing left and dropped back. JERSEY GOLD broke in a tangle and never close while also
bolting the turn always far behind HALF TAP close up to the turn, dropped back quickly through the drive.
