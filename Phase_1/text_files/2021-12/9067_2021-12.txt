Footnotes
GOLDEN VICTORY dueled inside of TWO PUNCH CAT on the backstretch, continued dueling through the turn and into the stretch, held slim margin
throughout the stretch and just lasted to share the victory. TWO PUNCH CAT dueled two wide throughout with GOLDEN VICTORY, battled gamely in the
stretch to get up for the dead heat at the wire. DAPPER tracked dueling leaders along the inside on the backstretch, continued well placed on the turn,
entered stretch in range and stayed on to hold show. HE BE DANGEROUS tracked dueling leaders two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the
turn, entered stretch three wide and stayed on pace in the lane. LEGALLY GRAY off a bit slow, stalked pace three wide on the backstretch, continued three
wide on the backstretch and failed to launch a rally in the lane when prompted. W. WHITEHOUSE settled well off the pace on the backstretch, and failed to
make an impact throughout. RUN MANNY RUN turned head as the gates were opening and came away very slow and never threatened.
