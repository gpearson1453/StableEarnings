TROPICALDEPRESSION tracked the early pace and made a four wide bid leaving the turn, then hit the front leaving the furlong marker, then was on the
left lead by the sixteenth pole, then switched back to the right late while being clear, driving. AWESOME TAP was reserved early on the inside, swung out
five wide leaving the turn, closed well to be clearly second best. VACCINA pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole to
gain a short advantage leaving the turn and then came up empty in the final furlong, bested rest. OUR GOLDEN COLLEEN was well placed on the inside,
tipped out three wide leaving the turn and weakened in the drive. STIMULATING MISS chased the pace five wide and weakened. CHARLYS WILD ANGEL
raced on the inside and had no response. NOBLE CITY set a pressured pace on the inside and was headed by the quarter pole, then was pulled up by the

furlong marker, then was outfinished late to just miss. OH SO JAZZY was void of early speed, then advanced and made a five wide move leaving the
quarter pole to loom boldly but hung late. LEFTATTHEALTAR was four wide into the first turn, then stalked the fast early pace three wide, then went up to

HONOR COLLECTION was allowed to settle early towards the inside, then eased out mid way on the second turn, made a four wide bid leaving the quarter
pole, then floated out five wide leaving the turn and drew clear in the final furlong to prove best under a mild drive. VATICAN MOON prompted the pace and
made a three wide bid on the turn, then vied for command with the winner to the furlong marker but could not go with that rival late while clearly second
best. MR. SHENANIGANS set the pace while racing in the two path, was headed leaving the turn and weakened, stayed on for the show award. BOOK OF
DELANCEY chased the pace four wide and had no rally. BREWING STORM chased the pace five wide and was four wide by the quarter pole and faded.
MARC WELLS was settled four wide early and had no rally. DON TATTO had no response while three wide early. READTHETRANSCRIPT was reserved
early and made a mild move on the inside on the turn and weakened. JOHNNY ICE steadied after the start and was not a factor. WAR LANCER stalked the

MASS APPEAL set a pressured pace while racing in the three path, then drew off on the turn, drifted out leaving the turn, then lasted late to prove best, all
out. ROCKET BLAST prompted the early pace five wide, then chased the pace four wide on the turn, then shifted in leaving the furlong marker and closed
well to just miss late. START CASHIN was bumped and bounced around from between horses around the eleven sixteenths to the five eighths, then chased
the pace five wide on the turn, rallied well late. THOMAS KNIGHT chased the early pace towards the inside, swung out four wide for the drive and had a
belated rally. BLUEGRASS POSSE chased the early pace from between rivals, came four wide into the drive and offered no punch in the drive. COAST TO
COAST was well placed early between rivals and four wide, then chased the pace three wide by the quarter pole and faded. DAYTIME LOVER pressed the
early pace on the inside and weakened. THURMAN MERMAN was bumped early, chased the pace six and stopped.

OUR SWEET GIRL was well placed early, then eased out on the turn to make a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, then wore down the front runner late
to edge clear under left handed crop urging. FLATTERING RUBY prompted the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to shake clear by the
quarter pole, then remained clear by the furlong marker and was put to left handed pressure and dug in gamely but could not hold off the winner late, good
effort. S W BRIAR ROSE chased the early pace in the four path, then split rivals by the three sixteenths pole and had no kick late while besting the rest.
BEACH BANKER stalked the pace four wide and faded. PLANE DRUNK set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened. LOVELY LYDIA was off a step
slow then had no response.

HOLIDAY BONUS was settled early while three wide, made a four wide move on the far turn, drew off in the strtech to prove much the best under a drive.
SOUL FIGHT was reserved early, advanced four wide on the far turn, then drifted in nearing the furlong marker and finished willingly to be clearly second
best. A T M AWESOME was rated early while two to three wide, then dropped down to the inside on the far turn, checked hard nearing the five sixteenths
pole, then checked again by the furlong marker, angled out for racing room to be along for the show award, rough trip. I SEE THE STARS vied for the lead
on the inside and weakened in the drive. GOOGLE IT was allowed to settle early, made a five wide bid nearing the quarter pole but came up empty in the
drive. CRAZY KATER was settled back early, came five wide into the drive and had no rally. MOON MEISTER broke in the air at the start, not a factor.

crush his foes easily. ILOVECHARLYBROWN was reserved early, then made a inside run on the far turn, finished willingly while no match to the winner but
clearly second best. VISHNU was well placed early towards the inside and was two wide by the quarter pole and weakened, held show award.

and had no rally. OSCAR WINNER was allowed to settle early and was six wide down the backstretch, then was four wide by the quarter pole and came up
empty in the drive. YES FOR LESS was settled early on the inside and dropped back. ROYAL'S INVASION was four wide into the first turn, stalked the
