ALASDAIR unhurried early while confidently handled throughout, angled out for clear run and ran past late. IMPERIAL CAUSE sat in perfect position
outside, made a bid three wide into the stretch while no match for the winner but gamely held the place spot. SUCCEED chased pace three wide, battled
hard in the stretch but not enough to gain the place spot. SCHMOOZE fractious in gate, race evenly thereafter between horses far turn. THE JUDGE AND
JURY show speed from the rail, stayed on to deep stretch but faltered late. FROSTY DREAMS no speed from the gate but could not get untracked.
TONKAWA SPRINGS ran into trouble first turn, never reached contention. OFFICER NICK never a menace. MOMS MOON always outrun. RERALLY
unruly loading, never close thereafter. STEINBECK show speed from the two path for a half with nothing left. STAR SHOPPING had a troubled first turn,
secured good position after the incident to the half but was used up and faded.
