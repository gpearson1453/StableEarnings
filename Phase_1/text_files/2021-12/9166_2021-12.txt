Footnotes
NIAGARA GOLD settled in hand four deep, moved into striking distance through the second turn, took dead aim entering the stretch, wore down STOKED
and edged clear in the final yards. STOKED was away in good order, angled in to set the pace, widened into the second turn, weakened slightly entering the
stretch, was unable to resist the winner but clearly held the place. BOONE'S SPIRIT stalked the pace, moved up three wide to make a mild bid nearing the
quarter pole, but flattened and settled for the minor award. INDIANA RED tracked three wide, dropped back some between horses on the second turn, got
through toward the inside into the stretch but lacked the needed late response. AMES MISTER was allowed to settle off of the inside, came four wide but
failed to make headway. C F V NOBODYCARES was unhurried at the tail of the field, circled six wide and finished with a belated improvement. ECHO
MOUNTAIN was allowed to settle four wide and failed to respond. SUPER D'ORO passed only the tiring ones. DANTRUM contended along the inside to the
second turn and tired. RAJA'S TRICK was hard hustled for position into the first turn, was forwardly placed for a half and dropped out. WHITE SILVER
SANDS prompted the pace outside to the second turn and stopped.

Footnotes
SILENT DISCO was allowed to settle into stride toward the rear of the field, came under a ride into the second turn, looped into contention five wide,
brushed repeatedly with CAUSE A STIR in the drive and was fully extended to narrowly prevail. CAUSE A STIR settled in hand, advanced between rivals,
came four wide and loomed a danger, brushed with the winner through the drive and grudgingly gave in. QUICK MASTER set the pressured pace between
horses for the opening half, then along the inside to the stretch, weakened slightly during the drive and was all out to just hold the show spot. MONEY
LENDER contended between horses, moved up three wide to make his bid, but lacked the needed late response. KNIGHTLY MISCHIEF settled saving
ground, shifted out leaving the second turn and improved position. UNDERDRESSED prompted the pace three wide, contested the issue to the stretch and
faltered. MORAL AMBIGUITY broke slow, was unhurried into stride, finished with a belated improvement, but failed to threaten. SARGEANT BARGER
failed to make headway. WATERMELON CRUSH failed to respond. ELUSIVE FREUD was through after a half. NASHCHETTA broke outwardly and was
away behind his field, rushed up five wide, but was used up before going six furlongs and dropped out. Due to a timer malfunction times are unavailable.

JOYFUL HEART set the pressured pace three deep, opened clear on the backstretch, widened into the stretch, was kept to task and held sway. THE BOSS
FACTOR tracked four wide, took his run at the leader leaving the second turn, was no match for that one and was all out to hold the runner up spot.
COLOMBIANO was allowed to settle, responded when roused with three furlongs to run, looped up four wide, loomed large entering the stretch, but
flattened in the drive. DRINK settled saving ground, angled out on the second turn, circled five wide into the stretch and was making up ground. THE
PIRATES contended between rivals, made a mild bid leaving the second turn, but lacked the needed late response. GRAY HOPE was unhurried along the
inside, angled out and finished with a belated improvement. CHA VEZ was shuffled back at the start, was unhurried and failed to threaten. ANGELINO failed
to respond. GO TIME was never a factor. FRED'S COUNTRY BOY prompted the pace inside, settled off of the leader on the backstretch, but came up
empty on the second turn and faded. TALK TO THE MEDIA was forwardly placed along the inside to the second turn and dropped out. SENOR WILBUR
was squeezed at the start and never recovered.

Footnotes
MY PAL DAL made an early move between horses to gain a forward position, shadowed the leader into the second turn, wheeled out six wide to make a
bold bid, came to level terms inside the three-sixteenths maker and was fully extended to best the determined SON OF GRACE in the final bob. SON OF
GRACE opened clear to dictate terms, was collared leaving the second turn, dug in to meet the challenge but wasn't quite good enough. HARD NIGHT
tracked three deep, moved up to the outside of SON OF GRACE after a half, drew even between rivals leaving the second turn, but wilted in the drive and
settled for the minor award. HESITATION BLUES was allowed to settle, came five wide, churned on but failed to seriously threaten. BIG FRANK was
unhurried, tucked in to save ground, finished with a belated improvement. SIGNSOFAWARRIOR was allowed to settle, but lacked a response when called
upon. CROWN THE PRINCE contended between rivals four wide for six furlongs and tired. LEMONADE STAND was allowed to settle, mounted a mild bid
looping up four wide on the second turn, but came up empty entering the stretch and retreated. MR. BANYAN failed to respond. SIN CITY SLICK broke a
step slow, lagged well back and was never a factor. DOUBLE DAVID was forwardly placed along the inside but came up empty before going six furlongs
and dropped out. ROYAL DRAGOON was hung wide while never far back, but stopped after five furlongs. Due to a timer malfunction the six furlong and
mile fractions are unavailable.

BENCH tracked four wide, launched a bold bid leaving the turn, shook clear entering the stretch and maintained a safe advantage, bled. DISCO PHAROAH
was allowed to settle three deep, came under a ride and swung six wide leaving the turn, loomed large but was unable to reach the winner. RUN RUN
RAPIDASH prompted the pace outside, drew even between rivals leaving the turn, but flattened and was all out to just hold the show while racing on the
wrong lead in the stretch run. HANDCARVED set the pressured pace along the inside, was headed leaving the turn and gave way. EMERALD EXPRESS
contended along the inside, shifted out leaving the turn but lacked the needed late response. RIVER SHANNON was allowed to settle, circled into the
stretch six wide but failed to make headway. MIDNIGHT SHIFT was allowed to settle, got through along the inside, but lacked a response when called upon.
LAVENDER EARL was hustled along four wide for a half and tired. T QUALITY failed to respond. KEVALAR saved ground to no avail. BABYLON broke
slow and never recovered. Z FORCE MAJURE showed little. Due to a timer malfunction the opening quarter time is unavailable.

Footnotes
THE BLUE DRAGON was forwardly placed toward the inside, tugged along on the backstretch in traffic, moved out and bid between foes leaving the
second turn, opened clear and was all out to maintain a diminishing advantage. WAMEGO settled saving ground, took closer order on the second turn,
shifted out and split rivals leaving the three-sixteenths pole, finished with a rush but was unable to bridge the gap. AMERICAN GREAT settled between
horses, came three wide, tipped out further to find room, loomed large a furlong out, lugged in some in the drive and settled for the show. WEATHER
PRAYER was restless in the gate, came away a step slow, tucked in at once to save ground, got through and continued on willingly. MY MIRACLE MAN set
the pressured pace along the inside, disputed the issue to the stretch and gave in. CONTRACTOR BILL tracked three wide, moved with the winner on the
second turn, was fanned deeper still and faltered entering the lane. FLIGHT TO PARADISE was allowed to settle five wide and lacked a response when
called upon. BLAZEN JUSTICE prompted the pace outside, but came up empty between horses leaving the second turn and faded. UNEMBELLISHED was
allowed to settle, circled six wide through the second turn and failed to threaten. DUVEEN contended, but came up empty before going six furlongs and
dropped out. REBOPPER showed little. MY HOT TODDY went wide and was never a factor.

Footnotes
TIESTO settled in hand while never far back, launched a bold bid four wide, forged command nearing the furlong marker, opened clear then held a rapidly
diminishing advantage. FORT MOULTRIE settled saving ground, commenced his rally into the second turn, angled out entering the stretch, kicked on well
between rivals and was getting to the winner with every stride. GOLD MONEY contested the pace between horses, assumed command after a half,
disputed the issue to the final furlong and gave way. PRINCE MAIOR disputed the early pace, settled off of the leaders on the backstretch, came again on
the second turn, shifted out with a furlong to run but flattened in the drive. MOONSHINE NOW was allowed to settle, advanced between runners to make a
mild bid, but failed to sustain the drive. CELERITY was close up four wide, drew even into the second turn, contested the issue to the stretch and weakened.
LASTCHANCEATGLORY was forwardly placed between horses, angled out entering the stretch, but came up empty and faded. FLY NIGHTLY failed to
respond. KING'S OVATION was unhurried, moved up between horses, came four wide but wilted entering the stretch. CURRENT went wide and was never
a factor. BLESS THE KITTEN dropped well back, was distanced leaving the second turn. Due to a timer malfunction the six furlong and mile times are
unavailable.

LAUGH IT OFF was allowed to settle, came under a ride into the second turn, looped up five wide, reeled in the leaders and was up in the final strides.
CHELICHNA was unhurried, advanced swiftly between foes on the second turn, took over and opened clear, kept on well but was unable to resist the
winner. VOL DE SOLEIL was shuffled back early and unhurried into stride, made a late rally circling six wide and finished well. DANZA THE FIREBIRD was
close up along the inside, angled out leaving the second turn, bumped with MOREINTHEHAMPTONS near the three-sixteenths pole and again a furlong out
but kept on willingly. MOREINTHEHAMPTONS settled between horses, moved up four wide, bumped with DANZA THE FIREBIRD entering the stretch and
again a furlong out and went evenly. FLIRTATIOUS KITTY contended between horses, came to level terms leaving the second turn, but came up empty in
the drive and faded. QT BLIEGH settled saving ground, angled out entering the stretch but lacked a response when called upon. TOP HAT BOSS opened
clear to set the pace, was collared leaving the second turn and gave way readily once headed. ABAPORU was hustled along four wide, but came up empty
before going six furlongs and dropped out. TOUCHING THE SKY broke slow, dropped well back and trailed.
