Footnotes
MISS ALLIE GRACE raced off the pace inside, saved ground through the turn, moved out, engaged the leader in deep stretch from the outside, edging
clear. MILANA quickly sprinted clear after the start, showed the way into and through the turn by daylight, collared late, saved the place. BRIAR THICKET
void of speed along the inside, continued to save ground through the bend, moved to the outside for the drive, found best stride too late while rapidly getting
to the runner up late. MISS ALPHA BELLA turned in an even effort off the rail. VILLAREGGIA made little impact while racing three wide. CAGED BEAR
steered out to be four wide in the turn, failed to muster a rally in the drive. ADELE'S BLING faded in the two path. RUNNING POSITIONS OMITTED DUE
TO DENSE FOG.

Footnotes
LITTLE BURRITO back off the early pace out in the strip, closer three wide and in some traffic late turn, checked up, regathered, set down, rallied, finished
willingly to win going away. ON A SHOESTRING lacked early foot, dropped inside to save ground turn, brief wait entering the stretch, got through to take
over and show way past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner, clearly second best. FEMININE ALLURE behind the pace just off the inside in
the second flight, in some traffic while racing in the two path turn, continued to race in traffic nearing midstretch, steered in a bit for room, displayed some
modest late interest to be up for the show. COURTNEY FAY prompted the pace three wide, closer turn, flattened out in the drive. LIFE OF SATURDAYS
four wide in the turn while within striking distance, also had little left for the drive. COURAGEOUS CAPPEN dueled early along the inside, began to fade
before a half. FRANKIES MOONSHINE broke on top, set or forced the pace for a half off the inside, backed up in the drive.

Footnotes
WHENTHEDOVESCRY forwardly placed up the backstretch along the inside, two to three wide late in the turn, outside bid, drew off under firm handling the
final sixteenth. MINE MY TIME with the pace while between foes early, fell back to chased the leader through the turn, outkicked that one late for the second
spot, no threat to the winner. TIME HEIST broke alertly, narrowly set the pace off the inside and between horses, shook clear in the turn, proved no match
for the winner when confronted by that one with a furlong remaining, continued to falter a bit to be outkicked for the second spot. OLSON broke near the
back, raced behind the leaders turn, lacked the needed kick in the drive. TWO DOT prompted the pace while racing four wide, tired. SPLASH FOR GOLD
lacked early foot, never menaced. SECRET COURIER forwardly placed early, began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
MARIAH'S FORTUNE away in good order, closest to the leader for five furlongs, advanced and challenged outside that one in the second turn, drove
strongly clear through the lane under steady handling and while drifting slightly. DUNVEGAN DOLL settled off the early pace while saving ground, continued
to race along the inside 2nd turn, moved out a bit for the drive, could do little with the winner in the drive, far clear of the others. RUN THE TAP off a step
slow, lacked speed, dropped inside late in the second turn, along for the show, no threat to the top two. MOST EMPRESSIVE broke sharp, cleared before a
quarter, continued to show the way up the backstretch, offered little resistance to the winner when that one challenged in the second bend, continued to
weakened through the lane and was caught late for the place. CLAY'S CLOUD BURST made little impact while racing off the inside. BICAMERAL settled off
the pace, came four wide into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
IN DREAMS broke in top, dueled up front in hand up the backstretch and into the turn, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home, shaken up
past the furlong marker, expanded margin while drifting in late. CHASING TIME broke with the field, raced in the second flight three wide, proved no match
for the winner through the lane, fully extended to hold sway for the place. MAGNOLIA MIDNIGHT hopped at the start to spot the field a couple of lengths,
trailed in the run up the backstretch while close to the inside, angled out to be four wide turning for home, rallied for the show and was closing the gap on the
runner up late. SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY moved up after the start to duel for a half inside the winner, held a narrow advantage late in the turn then began to
give way. BITCOIN BANKER one paced along the inside, steered out a bit turning for home, came up empty for the drive. CITRUS BAY was finished before
a half. AQUITANIA ARRIVAL mid pack early while racing outside, four wide through much of the turn, failed to rally. AMERICAN CHAOS broke out, raced
back early as a result, moved briefly closer when five wide midway on the turn, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
BOURBON FRONTIER allowed the pace to go early, ranged up three wide into a challenging position by late in the final turn, challenged three wide upper
stretch, extended drive, proved best under firm handling. ALEX JOON moved outside in the first turn, asked along and advanced four wide to a forward
position in the second bend, lost ground to the winner into the lane, continued willingly to the finish to be getting to that same rival late. CATHOLIC GUILT
prompted the pace while off the inside, continued to apply pressure the middle half, challenged between horses midway on the final turn, briefly held a slight
advantage in upper stretch but could not contain the top two in the final sixteenth. ENGLANDER took command into the first turn, set the pace for six
furlongs then began to gradually weakened when headed in upper stretch. CENTRIFUGE lacked speed, continued back second turn, improved slightly into
the lane without proving a serious threat. STOCK DEAL raced in mid pack, was in the two path turning for home, failed to muster a rally. LAKE NAKURU
remained always back. KATZARELLI forwardly placed for a half along the inside, gave way.

Footnotes
COACH in the second flight three wide, moved closer in the three path second turn, challenged into the lane, put a head in front upper stretch, repulsed a
mild bid from the runner up soon after, edged clear under steady handling. JILTED BRIDE off a step slow, raced back for six furlongs outside, advanced four
wide exiting the final turn, briefly tried the winner from the outside nearing the furlong grounds then could not keep pace, clear for the place. WELLINGTON
WONDER broke in good order, narrowly showed the way into and through the first turn, continued to set the pace the middle half mile, began to weaken
when headed by the winner upper stretch, could not contain the runner up, saved the show. W W FITZY off slowly, raced back four six furlongs, improved
position with some mild, belated interest. AURA settled off the pace while inside, two path into the lane, failed to muster a response when called on for the
drive. WEST SIDE GIRL off a step slow, raced in mid pack early, was finished after a half. HYPERNOVA pressed the issue early, dueled the middle half,
gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
KAT'S HITMAN broke sharp, allowed the early leader to go, stalked that one into the turn, collared that rival turning for home, drew steadily clear while kept
to pressure. MY LITTLE TIPSY within striking distance along the inside, closer in some traffic in the two path late in the turn, chased the winner past the
furlong marker, proved no match for that one, all out to save the place. HARD TO PARK lacked early foot toward the inside, raced in the two path through
the turn, staged a mild rally to be getting to the runner up. FUNANDFUNNY in the second flight while between rivals, three wide while continuing in some
traffic exiting the turn, went evenly through the lane. SPORTY FLYER last to leave, trailed well back toward the inside, found best stride too late in improving
position. BEAUMONT BEAUX settled in mid pack off the inside, had little for the drive. AXIS failed to menace. PAPA STAR back off the pace while outside,
four wide through the turn, tired in the drive. STUD PUPPY was never a factor. FAMILIAR WAYS sprinted clear soon after showed the way into the turn,
offered little resistance to the winner turning into the stretch then stopped when headed.
