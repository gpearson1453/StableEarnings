Footnotes
FIRSTSLATE vied for the early lead, drove clear, saved ground around the turn and was all out and held on for the win. JUS MY IMAGINATION pressed the
pace, forwardly placed throughout, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. LIL' SISTER LOU raced within striking distance, made a late bid,
proved no match for the top two, but got up for show. GABY'S PROMISE broke in, raced near the back, made a late bid and was outfinished for show.
SARAHS HOME pressed the early pace, saved ground and weakened. DOHA shut off, bothered at the start, came around the turn on the outside, made a
wide gain, but was no factor. NOT ENOUGH BLING bumped at the start, raced in the back and was never a threat. ANGEL ARKIE bumped at the start,
raced near the back and showed little. RIVETRIX raced within contention, came around the turn on the outside and was outrun.

saved ground and was caught at the wire. L G GIRL raced in the middle of the field, had an outside trip, made a late bid, proved no match for the top two,
but was a clear third. MALIBU ROSE lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. T R'S FIRST raced near the middle of the pack, put forth an
even effort and was never a threat. HIDDEN EXPECTATION broke poorly, raced in the rear and showed little. SUGAR STAR vied for the early advantage,
dropped back, lost contact and was eased to the wire.

Footnotes
BRIAN'S IRON MIKE raced within striking distance, moved up, between rivals around the turn, made a late rail bid and proved the best. SMOOTH RIVER
vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished for the win. SPECIAL BREED raced within contention, came around the turn on the
outside and proved no match for the top two. IM JUST JOKIN challenged for the early advantage, saved ground around the turn and faded. BRIAR lacked
early speed, finished wide and showed late interest, but was no factor. FAMOUS YANKEE was fractious in the gates, pressed the early pace and faded.
WEDINGTON void of early speed and was never close. BIRCH always raced near the back and was no threat.

Footnotes
COCO TIGER raced within striking distance, made a late bid, took the advantage, was all out and held off a late charge by BEST YOU EVER SEEEN.
BEST YOU EVER SEEN void of early speed, came around the turn wide, made a strong rally, closed fast and needed more ground. I'LL RAISE YOU raced
in the middle of the field, saved ground around the turn, made a rail bid and was outfinished. FAREWELL TIME vied for the early lead, drove clear around
the turn and lacked a late kick. MCLEAN raced near the middle of the pack, came around the turn wide and put forth an even effort. TALE OF A STORM
dueled on the front end and faded. COROT lacked early speed and was never a factor. I'M LOOKING UP challenged for the early advantage, saved ground
around the turn and dropped back. CABOT TRAIL always raced near the back and was outrun.

Footnotes
C. F. SHELAUH unhurried in the early part, moved up on the outside around the final turn, rallied down the lane and was going away at the end. TALE OF
TENSAS pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. WHO DAT GREY raced in the middle of
the field, made a late bid and was a clear third. EMMAS RULER lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. SOCIAL GALAXY went to the
front, drove clear and faded. SHE'S OUR STAR raced in the back of the pack, improved position, finished wide and was no threat. MISS MIRACLE GIRL
showed early speed and dropped back. LAST DESTINY raced near the middle of the pack, had an outside trip, finished wide, faded and was outrun. WIND
ZEE pressed the pace, raced outside around both turns and retreated.
