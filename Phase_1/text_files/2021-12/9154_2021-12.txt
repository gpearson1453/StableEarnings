Footnotes
SALSA RITA broke sharply, conceded some ground to rivals to track just outside those foes racing four wide on the backstretch, continued with a steady
advance three deep on the turn to challenge for command in upper stretch, then went clear in the last furlong under firm right handed encouragement.
GLORY ROLL, brushed at the start, was urged between foes, then inside a rival disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, shifted off the
inside briefly resisting the winner's bid but couldn't match that foe in the closing stages while keeping on to prove best of the others. CLEM GEM settled last
dropping well off the leaders racing through the backstretch, steadily gained position between foes racing into upper stretch, then tipped out three deep in
the closing stages to prevail for a share. TEE UP broke readily, tracked just off the first flight along the inside in the opening quarter, saved ground to upper
stretch but offered no rally. MISS MARGARET ANN broke inwards brushing GLORY ROLL, was quickly righted the urged to force the pace outside that foe
racing into the bend but gave way after a half.

Footnotes
LUCA DREW THE ACE broke readily, shifted inwards to prompt the pace three wide racing into the turn, forged clear while angling to the inside and
widened the advantage under firm encouragement. TINKER'S PAL, urged inside foes prompting the pace through the backstretch, couldn't match the
winner nearing upper stretch but kept on inside rivals to prevail for the place honors in late stages. UNIQUE PATH tracked the leaders outside foes in
second flight, advanced on the leaders four wide racing into the turn to gain a position just outside the winner nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the
drive. NEPTUNES REVENGE broke outwards exchanging solid contact with OSABA, was quickly righted, then urged between foes pressing the pace into
the turn, but faded in the drive while switching out three deep late. KAPHAVATA broke slowly, was prompted to advance five wide racing into the turn,
briefly gained contention nearing upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. ROYAL BIZ ducked out at the start, was prompted to a forward placing
tracking just off the leaders along the inside, shifted out nearing upper stretch but offered no rally. OSABA broke inwards exchanging solid contact with
NEPTUNE'S REVENGE, quickly dropped out and trailed the field to the stretch. FREE SPIRIT proved no factor.

Footnotes
TAKE TO THE SKIES angled in gaining a position just off the pacesetter stalking that rival into the backstretch, tipped out racing into the second bend while
advancing readily on that rival, pressed the issue through the far turn past midstretch and edged forward late to prevail under firm handling. SWEET TINA
was rated off the second flight between foes, angled to the inside racing into the far turn and continued with a steady late response to prevail narrowly for
the place honors nearest the rail while closing the gap inside the winner. BIONDA SUPRISE angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second
flight, shifted out to the four path racing through the stretch moving to close the gap on the winner and just missed for second. THATS ALL SHEWROTE
sped to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, set the pace to the second bend, dueled inside the eventual winner through the far turn to midstretch
while shifting off the inside and gave out in late stages. RIVERCREST ROAD, off last, was settled between foes to the backstretch, shifted out three wide
after a half, was prompted to advance four wide racing into the far turn and continued with interest to gain position to the end. ESTILO ELEGANTE settled
between foes off the second flight racing to the backstretch and passed only tiring rivals. SHES SKY HIGH tracked off the second flight outside foes and
steadily faded racing into the far turn. SOLDAT TEMPTATION emptied out early. MA COCO, caught three deep racing to the first turn pursuing the
pacesetter into the backstretch, gave way after a half. LIZQUEENFLUERDELIS trailed throughout.

Footnotes
R ADIOS JERSEY broke sharply to gain the advantage under some mild prompting while shifting to the inside in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a
comfortable margin on her own courage racing into the bend, widened her advantage when given her cue by her rider with some mild hand urging racing
through the stretch and extended the margin to the end in a ridden out effort. STARSHIP NALA tracked off the second flight racing four wide through the
backstretch, was prompted to advance three wide entering the turn, gained second nearing upper stretch but never menaced the winner. BRAMBLE
BERRY, forwardly placed between foes tracking just outside the pacesetter racing to the turn, steadily faded into upper stretch. HEIRESSALL, urged inside
foes to gain a position tracking just off the pacesetter racing through the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and emptied out racing through the stretch.
ISLAND MAGIC tracked just off the pacesetter three wide between foes in the opening quarter but dropped out early.

Footnotes
MYSTIC LINK broke sharply, angled inwards racing to the first turn to attend a rival's pace under light rating to the backstretch, pressed the issue outside
that foe racing into the far turn, gained a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch and drew away late under firm right handed encouragement.
VICARAGE was settled last racing to the backstretch, swung outside foes nearing upper stretch to advance in the five path entering the lane and continued
with a steady late effort to prevail for the place honors four wide nearing the wire. CURLIN'S THRILL, reserved off the second flight along the inside in the
opening half, tipped out racing into the far turn to gain position three wide between foes, then continued with a steady effort in that path while being
outkicked for second. BOLD PAYNTER angled to the rail racing into the first turn stalking just off the pacesetter under rating, continued in close quarters
nearing the far turn, was prompted to advance along the rail into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. BEN COPENHAGEN sped to the lead from
the outset, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage racing a bit off the rail into the backstretch, dueled for command inside the eventual winner through the
far turn into upper stretch and gave way leaving the furlong marker. TONY SMALL tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch and
came up empty entering the far turn. DOUBLE TOUGH TIGER, caught four wide racing into the first turn while being prompted to contention, tracked the
leaders three deep in second flight but faded early.

Footnotes
SHIVAREE was prompted to gain a position while angling inside tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance on the backstretch, switched out four
wide racing into the turn while being urged to advance, continued four wide into upper stretch and found his best stride in the closing stages to narrowly
prevail in time under right handed encouragement. R MERCEDES BOY ducked out at the start momentarily impeding CAJUN CASANOVA, was righted to
gain terms with the pacesetter three deep prompting that rival on the backstretch, pressed the issue outside that foe racing into the bend to gain the
advantage racing through upper stretch, held sway on a narrow advantage to late stages but just failed to contain the winner. WELL DEFINED urged
between foes in the opening stages to dictate the pace on a narrow advantage, shifted to the inside nearing the turn disputing the issue inside a rival,
contested the issue past midstretch but weakened late. CAJUN CASANOVA, carried out at the start, was righted to track off the first flight three wide
through the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path between foes nearing upper stretch lodging a brief bid but lacked the needed final kick.
GRAINGER COUNTY, urged along the rail prompting the pace in the opening stages, continued in pursuit of the leaders along the inside through the turn to
upper stretch, then faded in late stages. DRAMA CHORUS, off last, was settled well off the leaders shifting off the inside racing through the backstretch but
never gained contention.

PUGILIST broke readily, pulled her way against firm restraint to gain the advantage racing to the first turn, held sway on a clear margin racing into the far
turn and maintained a safe advantage through the closing stages under some right handed encouragement. GO YEOWOMEN broke readily, was rated just
off the leaders while angling to the rail leaving the chute, tracked off the second flight inside a rival racing to the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch
gaining position inside foes when presented an opening and edged a rival for the place honors in the closing stages. POSTINO'S IDOL tracked just off the
pacesetter along the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance shifting a bit off the inside racing through the lane and weakened late to lose
second. STRONG GEM, reserved off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance angling out four wide nearing upper
stretch but continued with interest to improve position. HOITY TOITY was rated between foes in the opening stages, then tracked off the second flight
outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing through the far turn while being iurged to lodge a brief bid between foes but faded in
late stages. FEETS OF FEATHER settled last racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes while being urged to advance on the far turn, was fanned five
wide entering upper stretch but lacked the needed closing bid. STORMY D, reserved along the inside early, offered no rally. LUNA QUEEN prompted to a
forward placing tracking the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the backstretch, emptied out between foes nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
ACE DESTROYER took up a position three deep between foes tracking the leaders in second flight, made a steady advance in that path through the turn to
close the gap on the leaders racing past midstretch and responded to firm left handed pressure to prevail in time. CREEKMORE, bumped at the start, was
quickly righted, then urged to the lead while angling to the inside in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the bend, dueled for
command through the bend past midstretch in a grudging effort but couldn't contain the winner late while prevailing for the place honors. LOUD N PROUD
broke readily, then conceded the lead while switching outside the pacesetter in the opening stages to prompt that foe racing into the bend, pressed the issue
nearing upper stretch to gain even terms between calls late but couldn't match the winner and was outfinished for second. DOODLE HOPPER broke
outwards bumping CREEKMORE at the start, was righted to track the leaders from out of striking distance racing three wide between foes into the turn and
continued evenly in the closing stages while gaining some position. ARRIVEDERLA tracked off the first flight along the inside in early stages, saved ground
to upper stretch but had no closing bid. GEMO, caught five wide, then four wide tracking off the first flight racing into the turn, steadily faded nearing the
lane. OHIO MUNNY tracked the leaders between foes from just out of striking distance but faded early. ARAZI LIKE MOVE trailed throughout.

GEM MINE, in touch with the first flight inside foes in the opening stages, was eased off the leaders to stalk those foes along the inside under light rating
racing into the backstretch, saved ground in that position to upper stretch, tipped out three wide racing through the lane and responded to firm handling to
wrest a narrow advantage from between foes in time. ADELIE (IRE), reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn
gaining position inside foes, then shifted out four wide racing past midstretch finding her best stride to close the gap on the leaders nearing the wire while
finishing on even terms with a rival for the place honors. LATIN NIKKITA, urged three deep between foes joining the pace leaving the chute, prompted the
pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue nearing upper stretch to gain a narrow advantage racing through the stretch but couldn't
quite fend off the winner while finishing on even terms with a rival for second at the wire. COFFEE BEAN, urged between foes in the opening stages
disputing the lead, angled to the inside nearing the first turn to dictate the pace on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, dueled for command inside a rival
on the far turn past midstretch but weakened late. DANCING SOPHIA, reluctant to load, was taken in hand momentarily when caught in tight quarters
leaving the chute, tracked off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to gain some position between foes racing into the far turn but
lacked the needed closing response. CURRENT CAUSE settled along the inside racing to the first turn, switched outside rivals after a half, was prompted to
make some brief progress advancing four wide into the far turn but flattened out racing into upper stretch. DONNA LIRICA tracked off the second flight along
the inside but steadily faded into the far turn. MALIBU SKY, caught four wide leaving the chute, angled inwards to track the leaders outside a rival in second
flight, was prompted to advance three deep nearing the second bend but soon faded. MISS ELLE DEE KAY soon trailed.

Footnotes
JURA broke readily while angling inwards to race just off the pacesetter while being carried inwards slightly by MIDNIGHT TEQUILA, continued just off the
inside racing to the bend, tipped out to press the issue between foes leaving the midway point of the turn, pressed the issue past midstretch and edged clear
late under firm right handed pressure. JUMP BACK JACK broke sharply, angled to the rail setting the pace on a clear margin racing into the bend, resisted
the winner's challenge leaving the turn past midstretch but proved only second best. PHAROAH CAT, bumped, then squeezed between rivals at the start,
was collected while dropping off rivals, was prompted to advance while shifting out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly in that path to
close the gap while gaining a share. NINTH OF APRIL, bumped soundly at the start, was righted to track the leaders three deep from out of striking distance
racing to the turn, shifted inwards nearing the lane and continued evenly between foes. MIDNIGHT TEQUILA shifted inwards racing to the turn tracking just
outside the pacesetter, was urged to lodge a brief, three wide bid nearing upper stretch but steadily faded in the drive. NOTARY SOJAC ducked in at the
break while getting away slowly and never gained contention. BETTERMENT delayed the start when breaking through the gate, ducked out at the start
bumping PHAROAH CAT soundly, was righted, then urged to gain a position just off the leaders while angling to the rail on the turn but steadily faded into
the lane. SHIPWRECK angled to the inside early tracking just off leaders but faded early.
