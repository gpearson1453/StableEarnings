Footnotes
COOL RAGS settled saving ground, shifted out inside the half mile marker, ranged up four wide through the second turn, loomed large entering the stretch,
wore down the determined SCARABEA to narrowly prevail. SCARABEA settled in hand three deep, launched her rally through the second turn, came to
level terms entering the stretch, fought on but was unable to resist the winner. BROWN DELIVERS opened clear, set the pace off of the inside, was collared
entering the stretch, weakened but had enough left to preserve the minor award. BELLA CONCHITA broke slow, tucked in to save ground, mounted a long
drive midway down the backstretch, continued the advance four wide through the second turn and into the stretch and was making up ground. BIGGIE was
allowed to settle off of the inside, toiled on between rivals but failed to threaten. HONKY TONK HERO pulled along the inside through the first turn, leveled
into stride on the backstretch, but came up empty between horses on the second turn and faded. AMERICAN DRAMA tracked three deep, angled in on the
backstretch, got through to make a mild bid but came up empty after a mile. THE HAPPY GIANT lagged well back and was never a factor. ARISTON saved
ground to no avail.

Footnotes
HIGH NOON RIDER was unhurried on the outside of the trailing trio, moved up into the second turn, pounced on the leaders near the quarter pole, forged
command entering the stretch and gamely edged clear. ORAZIO was close up three deep under a snug hold, bid between horses on the second turn, came
to level terms entering the stretch, fought on but was unable to match strides with the winner. LORD REVELSTOKE settled in hand, tucked in to save
ground, advanced on the second turn, waited briefly in traffic entering the stretch, shifted out to find room and continued on willingly. TEXAS GANO was
bumped early, settled between rivals, ranged up through the second turn, came four wide to make a mild bid, but flattened in the drive. HONORABLE HERO
opened clear and angled in to set the pace, was collared leaving the second turn and gave way readily once headed. TILL THEN failed to respond. BOBBY
BABY bumped with TEXAS GANO early, was close up three wide to the second turn, but came up empty between horses and dropped out.

Footnotes
DERBY HOUSE was allowed to settle toward the inside, came under a ride into the turn, moved up readily, wheeled out six wide leaving the turn, engulfed
the leaders near the furlong marker and drew away to score as the rider pleased. SPRINKLEHEAD was fractious in the gate, broke slow and was unhurried,
mounted a late rally circling six wide, finished well and was up in time to earn the runner up spot. EAGLE CAP was close up off of the inside, launched a
bold bid four wide, was bumped and forced deeper still leaving the turn, flattened but had enough left to hold the show. VALLEY VISTA was allowed to
settle, ranged into striking distance through the turn, jammed between foes nearing the quarter pole bumping PRO BONO soundly, loomed a danger but
weakened in the final furlong. DRUM AND BASS was shuffled back at the start, settled along the inside, closed the gap on the turn, lacked room nearing the
furlong marker, altered out sharply and kicked on willingly. PRO BONO vied along the inside early, shifted out and reengaged on the outside, disputed the
issue to the stretch and faded. BLAZEN JUSTICE stalked the pace, made his bid three wide, was jostled hard between foes near the quarter pole and came
up empty thereafter. THATS MY DUDE broke awkwardly, was allowed to settle, came four wide but failed to make headway. LISA'S GUY failed to respond.
ELVIS JUST ELVIS was allowed to settle, angled in to save ground but lacked a response, bled and was vanned off. RUSHINGUY sent hard to set the

Footnotes
RHETT THOMAS sped clear to dictate terms, dug in to meet the bid of SNAKE BITE leaving the second turn, turned that one away then was fully extended
to keep the steadily closing CARDIAC KID at bay. CARDIAC KID was nearest the pace three deep, tacked to the inside leaving the second turn, got through
and kicked on well but was unable to bridge the gap. SNAKE BITE settled in hand, made an early move along the inside to range into contention, shifted out
and loomed large leaving the second turn, but wilted in the drive and settled for the minor award. BRYTON'S D J was allowed to settle, came three wide,
failed to seriously threaten but improved position. DOUBLE DAVID was close up three wide, angled in on the second turn, came up empty entering the
stretch and gave way. AL MILLON BOB was hustled along in mid pack toward the inside but failed to threaten. MR ZYDECO was hustled along while never
far back for six furlongs and dropped out. SIGNSOFAWARRIOR showed little. PASION AZTECA was never a factor. CROWN THE PRINCE pulled early,
dropped well back into the first turn and never recovered. THE SEVEN-EIGHTHS TIME WAS OMITTED PENDING FURTHER REVIEW.

Footnotes
DECK OF CARDS prompted the early, pace, forged a narrow lead entering the backstretch, battled on in dogged fashion thereafter and proved unyielding
following a prolonged drive. MAOTAI disputed the pace between horses, fought on through a long drive but wasn't quite good enough. FRENCH CUFFS
was fractious in the gate, went wide into the first turn, made an early move four wide, looped up to join the vanguard leaving the second turn, but weakened
in the drive and settled for the show. BELLA RUNNER vied along the inside early, settled off of the pace on the backstretch, shifted out leaving the second
turn, loomed a danger but lacked the needed late response. PARIS PARAMOUR was unhurried into stride, finished with a belated improvement but failed to
seriously threaten. BURROW DOWN bobbled at the start, was allowed to settle between horses and failed to respond. HARDSPUN WOMAN broke a step
slow, settled saving ground, moved up some on the second turn but failed to sustain the drive. BEE RIGHT stumbled at the start, was allowed to settle,
came six wide but failed to make headway. SHE CAUGHT MY EYE contended between horses for six furlongs and tired. DIRTY NELLIE settled off of the
inside, was through leaving the second turn and faded. SISTER POST showed little. BODE BY YOU went wide and was never a factor. Due to a timer
malfunction the seven furlong time was unavailable.

Footnotes
GRANITE CANDY stalked the pace, made her bid four wide, took over entering the stretch, shook clear and was all out to maintain a diminishing
advantage. MS TEMPTATION was allowed to settle, angled out seven wide leaving the turn, finished full of run but was unable to reach the winner. DEEP
DISH was hustled along between horses, shifted out entering the stretch and finished fairly well. SHOW ME THE BEST prompted the early pace, assumed
command midway through the turn, but weakened between rivals and gave way. FINE PROSPECTURE broke a step slow, settled saving ground, tipped out
and made a belated improvement. BRINCA BRINCA was close up three wide, angled in on the turn to save ground, shifted back out into the lane but lacked
the needed late response. DE BOLT LIGHT passed some tiring ones. MOMMA RIO settled saving ground, got through but lacked a response when called
upon. BEIRUT BEAUTY broke slow, rushed up five wide, but came up empty entering the stretch and dropped out. TRAVEL GIRL sprinted clear at once,
was quickly collared, contested the pace through the turn and tired. GOLDEN ACCOUNT broke slow and never recovered.

MUSED (GB) settled in hand, ranged up four wide through the turn, wore down her rivals inside the furlong marker and kicked away. DOCS SEVEN was
away in good order, disputed the pace along the inside, fought on determinedly but was unable to go on with the winner late. FREEDOM BOUND tracked
the leaders off of the inside, split horses in the final sixteenth and finished willingly for the minor award. HEY KITTEN contested the pace outside, weakened
slightly between rivals in the drive and gave way. TWO SIXTYONE was unhurried, angled out five wide entering the stretch and was making up ground.
MAYBE LATER broke a step slow, rushed up along the inside, but faltered entering the lane and faded. FABRICATE failed to respond.

Footnotes
TRICKIZAR stalked the pace off of the inside in hand, waited in traffic leaving the turn, found room and slipped through along the rail into the stretch, took
over at will and drew away to score with something left. DULCIMER DAME was allowed to settle, advanced between horses, was bottled up in traffic leaving
the turn, weaved through and finished well once clear. SHAPE OF YOU vied for the lead between horses, then just off of the inside through the turn,
weakened between rivals but had enough left to preserve the show. RADIANTRITHYM was hustled along between horses, got through and was making up
ground. MATT'S HONEY was unhurried into stride, settled well back, rallied between horses and improved position. OUR MUSICAL MOMENT vied for the
lead between foes, came five wide but flattened in the drive. MISS PINKERTON was allowed to settle, came eight wide to make a mild bid, failed to sustain
the effort and was vanned off. MY DARK SECRET dueled along the inside, steadied in tight into the turn, lost position and never recovered. SHIMMERING
DREAM stalked the pace, moved up five wide on the turn, came seven into the lane, but faltered in the final furlong. MARGARET DRIVE was close up five
wide, came six wide into the stretch and tired. WHISKEY SIS broke slow and was never a factor. ONLY REWARD'S prompted the pace three wide between
foes for a half and dropped out. Due to a timer malfunction the five furlong time was unavailable.
