Footnotes
STEELY BAND stalked the pace behind horses on the turn, eased out to the four path approaching the stretch, swept to command in upper stretch and
drew off under urging. EL BOCHINCHE chased the pace four wide, gained a clear lead leaving the turn and weakened in the drive. PEARLYVILLE , four
deep on the turn, had a slight rally. BROADWAY MELODY , four wide leaving the turn, passed tired horses. SAINT RITA , along the inner rail around the
turn, moved to the three path in mid stretch and passed tired foes. ARBELA was not a factor. BAD TEMPER , five wide entering the stretch, was outrun.
WILLOW'S CHARM , three wide chasing the pace, gave way in upper stretch. LOVE DUST raced outside horses while outrun. MOON BIZ showed speed,
saved ground on the turn and gave way. BELLATORA broke sluggishly and was rank soon after the start. LA AITANA showed brief speed along the rail.

Footnotes
STEVETHEVANDRIVER stumbled at the break, recovered and edged up to the inside of foes, advanced between rivals leaving the three sixteenths, shifted
out, closed outside foes under aggressive hand urging in the final sixteenth and got the bob. ALL FOR LOVE broke a step slow, lagged off the pace while
saving ground, remained inside into the lane, made a game grinding run, drew on near even terms late and missed the bob. ALWAYS DRINKING , keen to
go early, had speed and rated back off the leaders into the turn, tracked the duel three wide mid turn, went on the attack into in upper stretch, gained
command past the eighth pole, briefly spurted clear then gave way grudgingly between foes. STRONGER THAN DEX , in the clear off the leaders past the
half mile marker, chased three wide into the lane, angled out near mid stretch but came up empty. RIDICULOUS , off the pace, raced five wide and between
rivals into the stretch and closed. UP FOR THE CHANCE sped clear early, was joined nearing the half mile pole, got in an extended battle to the inside of
GOLDEN AVIEATOR, fought on two wide past mid stretch then weakened late. GOLDEN AVIEATOR , four wide early, bid three wide outside UP FOR THE
CHANCE heading to the turn, sparred to upper stretch then wilted. HEAVENLY TRIP rated back off foes early, advanced between rivals and under asking
nearing the stretch, chased past the three sixteenths then gave way. BANDFROMTHEBAR , ridden three wide chasing, circled six wide outside foes into the
stretch and tired.

Footnotes
STORMIN' COUGAR prompted the pace outside KYMMIES' COUGAR around the turn, gained the lead near the eighth pole and was kept under urging in
the drive. CROSSTOWN GIRL , in the two path on the turn, was taken to the four path entering the stretch and closed outside horses. JOE MIKE JIM , three
wide on the turn, raced between horses in the stretch and had a mild rally. DATS A SUPERSTAR was not a factor. KYMMIES CHARDONNAY set a
pressured pace along the inner rail and gave way. NOBODY'S SECRET , well positioned in the three path on the turn, gave way. SUPERIORITY hugged
the inner rail on the turn and weakened. MISS SEDUCTIVE lacked speed and was not a factor. ILLUSION OF HOPE , along the inner rail on the turn, failed
to rally. INSTPARTY was outrun. SALTY SAUL , four deep on the turn, faltered.

Footnotes
NASHVEGAS , away alertly, prompted the pace two wide, moved to engage BULL SHARK heading into the turn, vied outside that rival while confidently
handled, was roused clear past the three sixteenths and held firm while kept to right handed asking. PASCAL CHANT saved ground in range of the
contested pace, eased out under pressure into the lane and kept on well to gain the place. ACE NINE NINE , off the pace while saving ground, was under a
ride mid turn, moved out in upper stretch and closed mildly. BAPTIZE THE BOY stalked outside a rival, raced four wide under urging into the stretch but
failed to generate a solid kick. BULL SHARK sped clear early and dropped in towards the rail, was joined into the turn, dueled to upper stretch then
weakened in the final sixteenth. EXTRA MEDIUM , between rivals mid turn, raced three wide into the lane but lacked a solid kick. FIX ME A SANDWICH ,
fractious in the gate, had his rider lose the left iron after breaking poorly, was taken wide, made a mild run leaving the far turn then gave way.

Footnotes
SOLOMONIC had speed towards the inside then was nicely rated back off the aggressively handled leaders, shifted out and tracked three wide under
confident handling, bid three deep into the far turn, spurted clear three furlongs out, opened up under a ride around the turn then maintained a comfortable
advantage while kept alert. LECTRIC CHOKE settled outside a rival and in range early on, responded when asked and picked up the pace three wide past
the five sixteenths, gave hard chase into the lane and finished with good energy to bridge the gap. FLATEXCEL was sent up between runners to take
command, dropped in and set a pressured pace, ceded command around the far turn, gave willing pursuit to upper stretch then faded. PURIMETER lagged
well back, raced between runners into the stretch but failed to generate a solid run. LUCKY RAMSEY saved ground stalking the leaders, was coaxed along
into the far turn, failed to kick on and faltered. GLENGAR was sent up three wide early, pressed the pace outside FLATEXCEL, failed to kick on leaving the
three eighths and retreated.

Footnotes
FILLE D'ESPRIT cruised up four deep nearing the half mile marker and entertained the pace, secured command nearing the three eighths, kicked clear
without much asking around the turn, opened up after being set down and was kept alert to late. MARGIE'S HEAVEN had speed to the inside, steadied
inside rivals into the turn, regrouped and advanced between runners in upper stretch, shifted in and kept on gamely to gain the place. BUNTING , in a bit
close after the break, settled in the clear early on, made a solid four to five wide run into the stretch, gave hard chase past mid stretch, kept on willin.
COCONUT CAKE , in tight at the break, raced well back early, was under pressure three wide into the stretch and offered a mild response. MISCHIEFS
MODEL forced the pace three deep between rivals, chased off the rail into the lane but came up empty. TOO MUCH TIP failed to menace. BLUEFIELD
moved up two wide between runners to take a short lead, ceded command leaving the far turn, chased around the turn and weakened.

KRUG , three wide the first turn, moved up two wide to wrest command on the backstretch and drew off in the drive while kept to his business. MAJESTIC
FRONTIER , unhurried down the backstretch, raced three wide the far turn and gained the place while lugging in in mid stretch. HIGH ROCK stalked the
pace down the backstretch, loomed three leaving the far turn then weakened. BISCOTTO D'ORO lacked speed, circled the far turn four deep and was no
threat. POWER G , no factor, was three wide leaving the far turn. PALACE KING broke slowly then was outrun. I'M NOT SLOW , inside horses chasing the
pace down the backstretch and gave way. MADE TO BE LUCKY , three wide chasing the pace down the backstretch, faltered. NO MONEY DOWN showed
speed along the rail and was done after a half mile. BUSHWICK BRUISER was outrun.
