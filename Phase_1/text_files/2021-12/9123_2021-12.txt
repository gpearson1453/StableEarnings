Footnotes
PRINTRACK broke in at the start, angled in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied along the rail while inside of a foe on the
turn, responded well when asked once straightened for the drive, came under a left-handed crop outside the eighth-pole, extended the advantage into the
final furlong, passed the sixteenth-pole under a strong hand-ride, was given one pop of a right-handed crop late and proved much the best under strong
urging. GOOD SKATE established position just off the pace while inside of a rival, drafted in the two path on the turn, was asked just inside the
five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive, chased the winner to the wire and finished willingly for the place. NECROMANCER tracked the pace
on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the turn, spun into the stretch under a drive then dropped back and weakened but was clear for the show.
ARANJUEZ dropped back off the pace, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, raced inside to the two path on the turn and failed to threaten. ANY
MINUTE bumped soundly with a rival at the start and was slow into stride, spotted the front a few lengths, went around the turn in the two to three path and
was no factor. RED REVOLUTION was fractious in the gate, broke in then was sent hard, chased the pace on the inside, moved out leaving the
backstretch, dropped back two then three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and capitulated. DONTBELATE broke in and brushed the gate
then bumped soundly with a foe, was slow into stride and spotted the front a few lengths, traveled around the turn in the two path and failed to rally. R BOY
CHEEKUM dropped back while urged along, saved ground on the turn, moved off the rail outside the quarter-pole then came three wide into the stretch and
failed to threaten. IN FACT broke out then was corrected by the rider, was urged along off the pace, went four then five wide on the turn, floated seven wide
into the stretch and faltered.

path on the turn, was asked into upper stretch, extended the advantage under a drive into the final furlong, drifted out under a left-handed crop into the final
sixteenth and proved much the best. PRAIRIE FIRE was last to commence then in tight while having her path taken, raced near the back of the field, went
around the turn in the two path, swung out into upper stretch and safely secured the place. CARTWHEEL settled off the pace, moved closer with a half-mile
to run, saved ground under urging on the turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. DIVA BANKER moved out with six furlongs to run,
settled just off the pace, was urged four wide on the turn and came up empty. VIRADIA bumped with a rival at the start, settled outside under some urging,
went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. HOLMDEL PARK broke inward in front of PRAIRIE FIRE then
was corrected by the rider, went three then two wide on the turn and was no factor. SARATOGA BEAUTY bumped with an opponent at the start, pressed
the pace on the outside, dropped back with a half-mile to run, was urged three wide on the turn and capitulated. NURSE RACHETT bumped with a foe at
the start, chased the pace on the outside, dropped back with a half-mile to run, fell further back in the five path on the turn and faltered then was eased but

Footnotes
PAPA SMOOTH was hustled from the start, angled in while showing speed, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, took the
lead in closer to the two path into the stretch, leaned in while still on his inside lead past the three-sixteenths, switched to the proper lead approaching the
furlong marker then disposed of DEPUTY FLAG and proved best under steady urging. MERCHANTS OF COOL bumped with a rival at the start, moved up
under urging, saved ground while chasing on the turn, was driven four wide into upper stretch and safely secured the place. DEPUTY FLAG broke in then
was hustled, angled in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, was asked inside the
five-sixteenths, lost the advantage into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. QUINTARELLI settled on
the outside, was carried out late on the backstretch, chased five then four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and came up empty. OUR
AMERICAN STAR was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, went three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
MACHO BOY was urged along off the pace, moved out late on the backstretch, chased four then five wide on the turn and capitulated. PAPA TOM B was
eased back early then moved out, angled in leaving the backstretch, was urged along in the two path on the turn and was no factor. CONFECTIONER
bumped with a rival at the start and was off a bit slow, raced towards the rear, rounded the turn in the two path, came out seven wide at the quarter-pole and
was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
REPO ROCKS moved up under urging then was taken in hand behind horses coming to the nine-sixteenths, drafted in the two path while held up behind
horses on the turn, waited while boxed in from the quarter-pole to the eighth-pole, altered course to the outside at that juncture, accelerated into the final
sixteenth and got up under strong urging. AMERICAN MONARCH broke out at the start, chased the pace on the outside, went four then three wide on the
turn, made a bid at the quarter-pole then took a short lead in upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while clear for the place. SIBELIUS
set the pace under pressure from two foes to the inside, vied three then two wide on the turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but
just held the show. FITZPATRICK was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and improved position to just miss
the show. RISK PROFILE raced well back in the field, went three wide early on the turn, moved to four then five wide later on that bend and also improved
position. FLATTER ME PLEASE was urged along off the pace, went four then three wide on the turn and tired. SOUTH AFRICA dropped back near the
five-eighths, settled towards the rear, started the turn in the two path, moved three then four wide later on that bend, came five wide into the stretch,
steadied briefly off heels nearing the three-sixteenths then altered towards the inside and failed to rally. SEND THE WORD settled on the outside, was
urged six then five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. ANYTHING PAZIBLE lacked early speed, went around the turn in the two path, came
six wide into the stretch and never reached contention. SIENA MAGIC was hustled from the start, pressed the pace down the backstretch, vied in the two
path early on the turn then dropped to the rail, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and capitulated. BUSTIN SHOUT was hustled from the start,
pressed the pace on the inside, dropped back leaving the backstretch and retreated.
