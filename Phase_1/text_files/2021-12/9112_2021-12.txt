Footnotes
CARAGATE disputed the pace on the inside of KNOW IT ALL AUDREY while along the rail, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch
under a drive, shook off the aforementioned foe inside the furlong marker and was fully extended to last. RCAPTIVATING settled off the pace, was asked
while three wide on the turn, shifted five wide late on that bend, gained outside into upper stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong, kept coming to the
wire but missed while able to get the place. WICKED LADY bobbled at the start, was well placed just off the pace, chased three wide on the turn, pursued
the winner under a drive in the stretch and was out-kicked while clear for the show. KNOW IT ALL AUDREY stumbled at the start and was last away, moved
up with five furlongs to run, settled just off pace from that point, was roused in the two path on the turn, came under the crop outside the five-sixteenths and
lacked the needed response. DOC DOC ROCK was away alertly, disputed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, was asked inside the
five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive, battled with the winner into the final furlong and weakened. QUEEN'S WARRANT dropped well
behind the rest of the field, went around the turn in the two path, turned into the stretch under strong urging and was no factor. KEEN DANCER brushed with
an opponent at the start, was urged along on the outside, dropped back five then four wide on the turn and showed little. NOLI TEMERE broke out and
bobbled then brushed with a foe, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch, suffered an injury to
the right foreleg nearing the furlong marker and was pulled up then vanned off.

runner-up under a drive into the final furlong, gained the lead into the final sixteenth and drew clear under steady handling. ENDLESS CRUSADE was
bumped hard in the hindquarters at the start but broke in front, showed the way down the backstretch, dictated terms while inside on the turn, was asked at
the quarter-pole then came under the crop in upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner into the final sixteenth and proved no match but was well clear for the
place. THE HONORABLE RUTH chased the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was driven three wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final
furlong and weakened but held the show. EUDAIMONIA broke in then bumped hard with a foe and was last to commence, swerved out near the
five-eighths, went six wide on the turn, passed foes into upper stretch but failed to threaten while able to get the last spot in the superfecta. DERBY KISSES
steadied near the five-eighths then dropped back, saved ground under urging on the turn, came out under a drive into the stretch and failed to impact.
WRITE THE CHECK settled off the pace, bumped with a foe leaving the backstretch, dropped to the three path early on the turn then the two path,
remained in the two path through the bend and failed to rally. UNBRIDLED'S REIGN was ridden along off the pace, went three wide on the turn and was no
factor. BOOM ROASTED was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn and came up empty. TAKE CHARGE LISA moved up with five furlongs
to run then was eased back off the pace, dropped back along the rail on the turn and capitulated. CAN'T CATCH KACY went five to six wide on the turn and
also was no factor. GIGGLING GHOST was reluctant to load, raced on the outside under urging, went five wide on the turn and failed to respond. RACING

Footnotes
BABA chased the pace down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, turned into upper stretch under a drive, took over into the final furlong
and drew clear under strong urging. GUNS BLAZING sped to a clear lead, raced inside on the turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch, lost the lead
into the final furlong and proved no match for the winner while able to hold the place. ADDILYN was urged along on the inside, saved ground on the turn,
moved out in upper stretch, drifted further out near the furlong marker and was along for the show. LITTLE MS SCARLET settled in the middle of the field
under some urging, went three wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. DANNY DEEP CUTS was coaxed along the outside, went three wide on
the turn and failed to rally. AWESOMENEWYEAR broke out at the start, was urged along at the back, traveled around the turn in the two path, moved out
under a drive in upper stretch, drifted in around the furlong marker and was no factor. DAZZLING SPEED bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, was
coaxed along off the pace, came under stronger encouragement in the two path on the turn and failed to respond. EFFIEMEISTER bumped with an
opponent at the start, moved out near the five-eighths, went four wide on the turn then came five wide into the stretch and failed to impact. JUST STAY
HOME broke out and bumped with a foe, angled out near the five-eighths, went four wide on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and showed little.

NOBLE THOUGHT settled off the pace, moved in midway down the backstretch, was hard ridden in the two path early on the turn, shifted three then four
wide while gaining at the five-sixteenths, made a bid into the stretch, dueled outside of the runner-up to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging.
MAGNETRON moved out while off the pace, dropped in late on the backstretch, chased while moving from the rail to the three path on the turn, took the
lead outside the quarter-pole, dueled inside of the winner in the stretch and just missed while clear for the place. PLAYWRIGHT was urged along towards
the rear, dropped from the three to the two path on the turn, came out under a drive into upper stretch and finished willingly for the show. MARBLE MOON
dropped well behind, went five to six wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and improved position without threatening. HIGH COMMAND was
urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and came up empty. INVEST pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn
and tired. FLOWERS FOR LISA was urged along towards the front, went three wide on the turn and had nothing left. BLOOD MOON settled off the pace,
moved from the two path to the four path under urging on the turn, came five wide into the stretch then angled further out and was no factor. TRAPPEZE
ARTIST was well placed down the backstretch, dropped back under urging in the four path on the turn and retreated. ASHAAR showed good speed and set
the pace, vied inside on the turn, lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole and faded. KAMPAI broke a step slow, moved up with six furlongs to run,
dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

the place. BOLD CONFECTION chased the pace on the outside then in the four path on the turn, pursued the winner while outside of the runner-up in the
stretch and just missed the place while able to get the show. DEALING JUSTICE chased the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, moved
out in upper stretch and tired. ROYAL MEGHAN broke a half-step slow, was urged along on the outside, went five then four wide on the turn, was carried
