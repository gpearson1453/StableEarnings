JUST STAY HOME was allowed to settle in the early stages, moved up three deep nearing the quarter pole and finished strongly in the stretch run to draw
clear late under steady handling. GRANDMARY stalked the top trio down the backstretch, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and finished second
best. SMOOTH AS GLASS was bumped, squeezed back at the break, settled towards the back of the pack early on, raced along the inside around the far
turn, angled four wide through the stretch and made a good late gain. SIP'N DIP broke to the outside, bumped with rival, chased the top pair down the
backstretch, raced two wide in the stretch run and had no late response. TAMIAMI pressed Speak English early on, took command around the far turn and
weakened the final eighth of a mile. MY BLONDE MARY broke to the inside, bumped with rival, was slow early on, raced towards the inside and had no late
rally. SPEAK ENGLISH showed good early speed to set the pace from the inside and gave way the final quarter of a mile.

YAK stalked the top trio in the early stages, moved up three wide nearing the quarter pole, raced four deep at the three sixteenths pole and finished well to
draw clear late under steady pressure. HIMELSTEIN chased the early leader while racing just off the inside, moved up two wide while racing between rivals
in the lane but was no match for the winner late. BLAKENSTEIN showed good early speed from the outside weakened the final eighth of a mile. OPTIMAL

towards the inside and had no late response. SWINGIN FRIAR was slow early on, raced two to three wide and never was a factor. SIMMARDSTRIKE
dropped back early early, saved ground and failed to respond.

Footnotes
BELLARIFIC stalked the early going, moved up along the inside through the lane and finished well to prove best under strong handling. EMPEROR'S
SONG stalked the pace from the outside, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and finished second best. PALMGIRL was unhurried early, moved up
five wide the three sixteenths pole and made a good late gain. BRIGHT AND SHINY broke awkwardly, settled towards the back of the pack early, moved up
six wide through the drive and gained ground in the final stages. WORKINONBEINSINGLE was sent along to set the early pace along the inside and
weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. IZSHEFROSTED pressed the early pace, raced two wide and weakened through the lane. MELANCHOLY BLUES
settled off the early pace, raced three to two wide in the stretch run and had not enough. PALIO SIENA chased the top pair and tired while racing near the
inside. CHERRY ROCK BRIDGE was slow early on, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor.

encouragement. SHIP IT RED was slow early on, made good rail bid in the drive and got up for the place position. CHESS MASTER raced up close early
on, dropped back a bit around the far turn, was near the inside nearing the quarter pole, angled five wide through the upper stretch and kept on to the wire.
PRIVET MOON pressed the early leader and weakened while racing two to three wide. GRADE ONE dropped back in the early going, raced five wide into
the upper lane and had no late rally. OIL MONEY vied for the early lead while racing two wide and gave way the final eighth of a mile.

Footnotes
SMALL HOPE was allowed to settle on, moved up two to three wide in the lane and finished well to get up under strong pressure. SNAP HOOK pressed the
early leader from the outside, took command nearing the far turn, led inside the eighth pole but couldn't match strides with the winner late to finish second
best. FAST FIRE was slow early on, swung six wide nearing the three sixteenths pole and made a good late rally. JIMMY D dropped back early on, moved
up three wide in the stretch run and showed good late interest. KRAMDEN raced four deep near the quarter pole and had no final winning bid. EL PILLO
stalked the early pace while racing three wide and weakened the final eighth of a mile. STUCK UP was allowed to settle off the early going and failed to
respond. FU ROO was forwardly placed early, tired readily and was done early. KROY was quick to begin to set the early pace, tired readily, was eased up
on in the stretch and had to vanned off. PER RULING 2022005218 FROM THE FLORIDA RACING COMMISSION, SNAP HOOK WAS DQ'D DUE TO A
POSITIVE TEST.
