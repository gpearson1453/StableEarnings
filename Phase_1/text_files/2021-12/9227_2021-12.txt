Footnotes
DOC LAMB lugged out 1/8, proved best. JUST A DASHA HERO no mishap, game 2nd. OTHER WORLD steady effort. GARDA DA CASH ducked out start,
lugged in early, solid try. FALLOUT away awkwardly, bumped start, lost path late. SQUID WORD lost footing start, lost path past 1/8. FAVORITE
COLOSSUS off slow, lacked rally. MILAN RED hopped, off very slow.
