Footnotes
GOODY TWO SIOUX set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear lead with a furlong to run and held sway to the wire. STONE TOP was reserved
just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. TOTHEMOONANDBACK was forwardly placed early, saved
ground through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. DODROPIN was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with some late
run. HOT AUGUST STORM broke sharply to press the pace while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. AKSARBEN SUMMER showed no early
speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FREESTONE was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, reached SQUARE ROOT with a sixteenth to run and proved best.
SQUARE ROOT set a pressured pace from off the rail, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. LIL'
NINJA was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with a late bid. ROUGE SUNSET chased
the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive. TEST DRIVE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did
not threaten. MONTANA JACK was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. BIG TONY pressed the pace while racing
four-wide and weakened after going a half. ABOVE THE LAW settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and gradually weakened.
LAZARUS COME FORTH lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
SUNSHINE EMILY pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-sixteenths pole and edged away in the drive. EVER
VIGILANT broke sharply to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide and yielded to the winner in the drive. C C THE BARTENDER was reserved just off
the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and failed to gain late. IZE DISCREET ROSE settled off the leaders
early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the lane and finished evenly. OUR LIZZY LOU was void of early speed, raced four-wide
through the turn and finished with a belated bid. THUNDER WOMAN chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. WINDI'S
MOMENT was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. LA ROSA DRIVE showed no early speed, raced off the rail
through the turn and did not offer a bid. IZZY B lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

SWAMP SOUFFLE settled off the leaders early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the three-sixteenths pole, vied with BLUE AZUL and proved best
in a stiff drive. BLUE AZUL sprinted clear at once, responded when challenged by the winner into the lane, vied with that foe and gave way grudgingly.
FREEZING JIMMY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and failed to gain in the drive. WE'RE JUST SAYIN
lagged early, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with a late bid. BLOW MY MIND pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after
going a half. BIG BARREL was off a step slow, raced five-wide through the first turn, rushed to vied, moved four-wide through the second turn and

through the closing yards. LITIGATOR set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the quarter, vied but could
not match strides through the final yards. LIMITED OFFER was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn, reached a contending position but failed
to gain late. AUTISM CAN DO was away in good order to press the pace while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half. VAPORIZED settled off
the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with some late run. KEEN JAMES was off
slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground and failed to menace. FRED was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. BIG
LARRY was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SHORT CUT refused to break.

Footnotes
CHRISTINE'S JACK was reserved just off the leader from between foes, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew
clear. DEVIL'S TEETH was never far back, raced four-wide through the turn,, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished with a steady bid.
WRATH disputed the pace while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. COUNT ALEXEI was away in good order to duel for the lead while
racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. FREIBURG lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and finished evenly in the drive.
FLOWER BEACH hopped at the start, lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. COUGAR COUNTRY raced off the leaders
early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. WICKED FORTITUDE was slow to begin, raced five-wide through the turn and did not
reach contention. RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
DEWEY stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied with GRANDPA A. C. and edged away from that rival
in the drive. GRANDPA A. C. was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up to offer a bid nearing the half, responded when challenged by the winner
nearing the quarter, vied with that foe and gave way late. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT was never far back, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished
with a steady bid. POPPY'S C NOTE settled off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn and finished evenly late. ROWDYROOSTER was
void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and did not reach contention. WILD WILD KINGDOM
sprinted clear at once, remained close up for three-quarters and weakened. MATSON showed no early speed, saved ground throughout and did not
menace.
