Footnotes
MALA tracked the early pacesetter racing to the outside of JEFFREY ON THE RUN through the initial stages, made a strong bid for the lead passing the
quarter pole, but met some resistance from CHATTY LEROYBROWN, battled that foe to mid-stretch while lugging out, gained the advantage inside the
sixteenth pole and won clear in the end. CHATTY LEROYBROWN broke best and made the lead with some ease with MALA and JEFFREY ON THE RUN
the only real dangers chasing behind, engaged MALA in a spirited stretch duel to deep stretch, then gave way grudgingly but easily held second. THIRSTY
VISION broke in at the start and bothered TYPHOON TOMMY, was outrun in the initial furlong and fell behind the three up front, was being pushed on early
then found a good rhythm with about three furlongs to run, made a mild rally down the stretch to gain third. JEFFREY ON THE RUN chased the pacesetting
CHATTY LEROYBROWN together with MALA to the turn, came under a ride passing the five-sixteenths marker and could not go on with those two at the
top of the stretch, was kept to task but had little to offer and tired. TYPHOON TOMMY veered in and was off-balance trying to avoid contact with THIRSTY
VISION at the break, raced well behind early, was put into a drive to try and regain contact with the leading trio, began to tire before the quarter pole and
was protected when hopelessly beaten. SET PRICE took up after the start when JEFFREY ON THE RUN veered into the path, dropped well off the pace
early, was ridden aggressively to try and get back into the race but could not improve and was outrun the rest of the way.

Footnotes
RULER OF ANGELS paused at the start and was off a bit slowly, was unhurried into the first turn and was content to trail along the backstretch run, roused
into the far turn, chased two wide at the quarter marker and improved position nearing the top of the stretch, split rivals into the drive and took a narrow lead
at the furlong marker, shook free into the final sixteenth, kept to task in deep stretch and held in a drive at the finish. HERECOMEGEORGIEBOY was
allowed to settle in the early stages while never far back, saved ground into the first turn, was taken off of the rail entering the backstretch run and tracked
the modest pace from the outside heading to the half-mile marker, roused five wide into the far turn and went widest into the stretch, came within aim
nearing the furlong marker, was gaining in the final sixteenth and was a clear second at the finish. CHELSIESDANZIGLITE broke alertly, ceded the early
lead and stalked the pace two to three wide into the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and tracked the modest pace heading to the half-mile
marker, advanced four wide into the far turn, vied for the lead into the stretch, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and held safely in the end for third. DANZ
TILL TEN was forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the early pace from an inside position into the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run
and tracked the modest pace approaching the half-mile, chased from the inside entering the far turn, lost position at the quarter marker and ran in pursuit
into the stretch, could not muster a final response and weakened in the late stages. PRECEDENT LUKE sent to establish the early lead, showed the way
into the first turn while off of the rail, set modest fractions into the backstretch run, led into the far turn and went three wide nearing the quarter marker, came
under pressure into upper stretch and met oncoming bids heading to the furlong grounds, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and faded in the late
stages.

Footnotes
LADY GOOD TROUBLE broke well and was pulling on the rider early, became a little rank coming out of the first turn, was left alone on the lead down the
backstretch and went clear, held sway through the turn, came into the stretch with something left and widened in the late stages under steady handling.
SUPER ELLIE settled from the break and let the pace scenario play out through the first turn, moved closer racing three to four wide on the backstretch run
then launched a bid from the three furlong marker, finished well but proved no match for the winner. CANDY ON TOP raced close up for a half-mile then
came under a stiff ride, seemingly dropped out of the race approaching the three furlong pole but was kept to task, came back on a bit and outlasted the rest
to gain the third spot. YOUR ROYAL FLYNESS broke a bit slow then rushed up into contention and was a bit keen, steadied twice in traffic on the first turn,
dropped back to last heading down the backstretch but not far behind, tried to launch a bid from the three furlong pole, did not quicken but kept on grinding
away down the stretch and just missed out on a minor award. SMILE AND PROFILE broke sharply then became hard to place through the first turn, took up
a stalking position outside of LADY GOOD TROUBLE while under a tight hold and fighting the rider a little, settled down and maintained position to the far
turn, was asked for more at the quarter pole but did not respond and finished one-paced down the stretch.

GROGU was sent leaving the start, vied for the early lead and assumed command into the first turn, contested modest fractions with RIGHT HAND RYDER
through the backstretch run, continued to dispute the pace inside of RIGHT HAND RYDER into the far turn, shook free into the stretch, was a bit erratic in
the lane and drifted while kept to firm urging nearing the sixteenth-marker, determinedly dug in in deep stretch and lasted at the finish for a game win.
RIGHT HAND RYDER broke alertly and assumed early command, was engaged into the first turn by GROGU, contested the modest pace while outside of
that rival entering the backstretch run, disputed the pace two to three wide into the far turn, was repelled by GROGU into upper stretch and chased to the
furlong marker, re-rallied past mid-stretch while being floated out a bit into the final sixteenth, battled GROGU to deep stretch and was gamely bested at the
finish, while holding safely in the end for second. ACERO allowed to settle in the early stages while not far back, maintained a ground saving position
through the backstretch run and was well placed at the half-mile marker, ran in pursuit two wide into the far turn, was outkicked at mid-stretch, re-rallied into
the final sixteenth, closed well in the late stages and was a clear third. ROARING TIGER settled just off of the early pace, tracked the leading pair from a
two to three wide path along the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and tracked between rivals heading to the half-mile marker, chased three
to four wide into the far turn and loomed nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked into upper stretch and chased at the furlong marker, could not muster a late
response and weakened in the final sixteenth. ADIOS NICANOR allowed to settle away from the start, raced three wide into the first turn and was content to
trail along the backstretch run, shifted to the two path entering the far turn and improved position at the quarter marker, could not sustain that run into the
stretch and did not threaten in the late stages. UNCLE WALT was forwardly placed away from the start, went three to four wide along the first turn and was
widest into the backstretch run, tracked the modest pace approaching the half-mile marker, ran in pursuit three to four wide into the far turn, could not keep
pace at the quarter pole and tired in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
ENOS SLAUGHTER lagged at the rear of the field through the first half of the race, began a forward move from the half-mile marker then navigated a dream
trip while saving ground through the second turn, came into the stretch full of run and quickly separated from the rest and won as much the best. CARDIFF
CRACK unhurried early racing in the three to four path through the early stages, was well behind racing wide through the far turn, was not asked in earnest
until being set down from the five-sixteenths marker then deftly navigated between and around tiring horses down the stretch to gain the place. MEEKING
was up on the pace going into the first turn then ceded the lead to QUE SERA SIR RALPH, made a bid for the lead on the far turn when that one started to
weaken, went three wide at the five-sixteenths pole while ENOS SLAUGHTER took the inside path, could match strides with that rival down the stretch,
raced on the wrong lead through most of the late stages and was passed for second near the sixteenth pole. DANZING REBEL was not asked for speed
from the break but was able to get forward position, moved out a path from the rail and sat well off the pace being set by the two leaders, launched a mild
bid from the five-sixteenth pole but flattened out while having trouble changing leads. COUSIN RICHIE was allowed to settle into stride and kept to the
inside while racing at the back of the field through the early stages, was still with a chance going into the far turn but did not go on when the pace quickened
and was only able to pass one in the stretch. QUE SERA SIR RALPH was hustled to the front and cleared the field, opened up on the backstretch run then
began to come back to the field on the far turn, was overtaken approaching the five-sixteenths pole and had nothing to offer in the stretch.

Footnotes
DROP UM hustled away from the start, crossed over leaving the gate and assumed early command, was engaged by CORACORACORA and contested the
solid pace outside of that rival heading to the half-mile marker, dueled through quick fractions into the turn, battled with CORACORACORA into the stretch,
shook free then kicked clear at the furlong marker, was kept to task into the final sixteenth, felt late pressure from the runner-up and held in a drive at the
finish. R HEISMAN broke in a bit at the start, raced close up away from the start, became hard to place when crowded in the early going, recovered and
stalked the solid pace from the outside heading to the half-mile marker, went three to four wide into the turn and chased the leading pair approaching the
quarter pole, was outkicked by DROP UM into the stretch, re-rallied in the final sixteenth but could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and was a clear
second. TIMTY chased the solid early pace from the outside, was guided three to four wide into the turn and ran in pursuit heading to the quarter pole, lost
ground into the stretch, was unable to impact the top pair in the final sixteenth and ran on in deep stretch to be a clear third. CORACORACORA veered in at
the start, recovered and showed good early speed while contesting the quick pace inside of DROP UM heading to the half-mile marker, disputed the solid
pace from the inside entering the turn, battled into upper stretch, could not keep pace heading to the furlong marker and gave way in the final stages. FAR
OVER LOADED settled off of the solid early pace while not far back, ran in pursuit while inside of rivals into the turn, came three wide into the stretch,
needed more in the late going and passed tired rivals in deep stretch. RIVERSIDE ROSE hit the gate at the start and was away slowly, lacked early speed
and trailed heading to the half-mile marker, lagged behind the field into the turn, saved ground to the quarter marker, was able to improve position in the
stretch but could not factor in the late stages. HAPPY SUE broke a step slowly leaving the start, rushed up and chased the solid early pace from the inside,
was well placed approaching the turn and ran in pursuit while saving ground nearing the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and tired in the final
furlong. SENSATIONAL Z Z was crowded a bit by a neighboring rival at the start, settled off of the solid early pace, maintained an outside path into the turn
and raced three to four wide approaching the quarter pole, could not muster a response in the stretch drive and did not make an impact. THERE WAS AN
OBJECTION LODGED BY THE TRAINER OF R HEISMAN AGAINST DROP UM FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE EARLY RUNNING AND IN A
UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
PASSARANDO was away well but not asked for speed from the break, raced between horses through the first bend, then tracked close up while always
traveling well, got a nice opening to run through turning into the stretch, was on the inside of four horses battling down the stretch, got a head in front in
deep stretch but had to hold off a resurgent TESORO near the wire to prevail. TESORO seized the early lead and was able to dictate very slow fractions,
was beset by challenges from the quarter pole, drifted out a path into upper stretch, fended of all but a bid from PASSARANDO to the inside, battled gamely
to the wire, lost the lead, came back but came up just short at the wire in a game effort. REDLINE tracked TESORO close up through the early running in
the three path, was first to make a move on that foe from the five-sixteenths marker then was four wide as several horses fanned across the track, finished
willingly despite being in a bit tight between horses in upper stretch but came up short in a good effort. AMERICAN FARMER came away well and was
content to track three wide, maintained position to the far turn then started to rally with three furlongs to run then was forced to go five wide into the stretch,
loomed at the top of the stretch, finished well but was outfinished in the final sixteenth. LORD SHELDON was last into the first turn, then settled behind the
field going into the backstretch run, raced in the two path through the turn then tried to launch a rally from the three furlong marker, swung seven to eight
wide into the stretch but was outkicked in the late stages. LOVE CANDY was hesitant to load into the gate, broke a step slow but was able to get good
position up close through the first turn, remained on the inside and loomed a threat as the field bunched up near the quarter pole then gave way down the
stretch.

LAMMAS (GB) settled just off of the early pace and was guided three wide into the first turn, tracked the decent pace into the backstretch run and was well
placed while between rivals nearing the half-mile marker, went two to three wide into the far turn, was roused nearing the quarter pole, split rivals at that
station and took command into upper stretch, kicked clear at the furlong marker, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and maintained a clear lead to the
wire. MIXTO was forwardly placed approaching the first turn, assumed early command and set a pressured pace into the backstretch run, carved out decent
fractions while prompted approaching the half-mile marker, showed the way between rivals into the far turn and lost the lead nearing the quarter marker,
chased LAMMAS into the stretch, could not match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and outfinished PRINCE ABU DHABI for the place honors.
PRINCE ABU DHABI settled just off of the early pace, was caught four wide entering the first turn and tracked the pace into the backstretch run, tracked
from the second flight heading to the half-mile marker, was guided four to five wide into the far turn, shifted six wide nearing the quarter pole and loomed
approaching the top of the stretch, vied for the lead at the three-sixteenths, drifted in under firm right handed urging and bothered PIROLI at mid-stretch,
recovered and chased LAMMAS into the final sixteenth, could not impact the winner in deep stretch and was outfinished for third in the final strides. PIROLI
broke in a bit at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered and was forwardly placed into the first turn, tracked the early pace while three to four wide into
the backstretch run, stalked the decent pace approaching the half-mile marker, went four to five wide into the far turn, vied for the lead at the quarter pole
and battled into upper stretch, was bothered and took up when PRINCE ABU DHABI drifted in nearing the furlong marker, regrouped past mid-stretch but
could not find the needed late response and was outfinished in the final sixteenth. IL BELLATOR broke alertly, ceded the early lead and tracked from the
inside approaching the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and tracked the decent pace heading to the half-mile marker, saved all of the
ground into the far turn and ran in pursuit nearing the quarter pole, maintained an inside path into the lane and lost ground at the furlong marker, could not
muster a late response and weakened in deep stretch. FREEPORT JOE unhurried away from the start, settled two to three wide into the first turn, was
content to trail heading to the half-mile marker, improved position three wide into the far turn, swung seven wide into the stretch, was outkicked at the
furlong pole and finished evenly. BRAZENLY hustled away from the start, was prominent in the early stages and attended to the pace between rivals
entering the first turn, prompted the decent pace through the backstretch run, battled between rivals into the far turn, lost position into upper stretch and
gave way in the drive. ZEUS' WAR settled just off of the early pace, was guided four to five wide into the first turn, tracked the decent pace while widest
through the backstretch run, chased five to six wide into the far turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and came up empty in the late stages. THERE
WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INVOLVING PRINCE ABU DHABI AND PIROLI IN UPPER STRETCH. IN A UNANIMOUS
DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH BASED ON THAT INCIDENT.

Footnotes
KITTEN'S KID broke well and went to the lead, was not pushed and was able to dictate the pace while maintaining a short lead, held sway to the far turn
then turned back all challenges and pulled away to a handy win. VULIN was caught three wide through the clubhouse turn, remained at the rear down the
backstretch but not far from the lead in the compact field, rallied four wide into the stretch won a three way photo for the place. POKER ALICE lacked early
speed and raced near the rear of the field between horses through the first turn, launched a rally under heavy pressure from the three furlong pole, tipped
out to the four path for the stretch run kept on well and missed second by a nose. TIZ MY PRINCESS was last away but kept to the inside through the first
turn, advanced into contention down the backstretch, lost some ground and dropped back to last heading into the far turn, then came back on under steady
handling and intermittent urging to just miss in a blanket finish for second. J AND M EXPRESS tracked just off the pace while racing three wide to the far
turn, went into drive from the three furlong marker, moved into second place turning for home, proved no match for the eventual winner, flattened out then
tired mid-stretch. ANISETTE got good position behind the pacesetting KITTEN'S KID took the inside path through the far turn when the rail was left open,
weakened at the quarter pole, dropped back to last and was not persevered with in the stretch.

DELIAN LEAGUE was forwardly placed away from the start, raced three to four wide into the first turn and tracked the early pace heading into the
backstretch run, tracked the loose leader from the second flight approaching the half-mile pole, was asked for run into the far turn and loomed three to four
wide at the quarter marker, took command into upper stretch, was set down for the drive and kicked clear at the furlong pole, was a bit green into the final
sixteenth, kept to task in deep stretch and maintained a clear lead at the finish. GOODBYE DAL broke out at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried in
the early stages, raced three to four wide into the first turn and was content to trail into the backstretch run, maintained an outside path into the far turn and
was roused four to five wide nearing the quarter marker, gained ground into the stretch, continued his rally into the final sixteenth, could not impact the
winner in deep stretch and got up in the final strides to secure place honors. BRAVO RAGAZZO prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace
outside of BOOMING BERNARDO and went two to three wide into the first turn, tracked the loose pacesetter through the backstretch run, chased into the
far turn, vied for the lead two to three wide and between rivals at the quarter pole, was outkicked by DELIAN LEAGUE at mid-stretch, stayed on into the final
sixteenth and was outfinished for second. BOOMING BERNARDO hustled away from the start, assumed early command and set the pace into the first turn,

into the first turn, maintained an inside path into the backstretch run and tracked the pace approaching the half-mile, saved ground into the far turn and
advanced nearing the quarter pole, stumbled and fell past the quarter marker and was transported off of the track via equine ambulance. TOPPERS
