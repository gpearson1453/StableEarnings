ALL ABOUT ALICE was unrushed early, rallied in the four path at the five-sixteenths pole and was clear late under mild urging. LIL'S COFFEE saved
ground, angled between foes at the quarter pole, led in the stretch and yielded to the winner. MULIMA saved ground, rallied on the far turn and was checked
at the sixteenth pole to avoid heels of a rival who moved inward. CAIRNHILL pressed the early pace inside, bid in the three path at the three-eighths pole,
moved inward late and yielded. SARANAC LAKE was bumped at the start, raced in the four path and lacked a late bid. NIPPY STAR bore in at the start,
raced in the three path around the first turn, drew clear and gave way in the stretch. STREETWHEREYOULIVE and REAL QUEEN were not factors. SHE'S
IT stalked the early pace in the three path and gave way after a half mile.
