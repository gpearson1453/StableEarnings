on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then drew off and was kept to the task. YANKEE HUMOR well placed
and outside, moved up inside the turn, gained a short lead on the two path through the turn, then was no match for the winner and held the place safe.
TRAVELLER laid on through the chute, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, lugging in
slightly and missed the place. RISEN SAVIOR unhurried, held position two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, angled out for
clear racing room and closed for a share. DISASTER RECOVERY broke in, pushing a rival in at the start, moved up through the turn, came through inside

Footnotes
STANHOPE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, drew off in the stretch and was ridden out. JUST WATCH ME NOW
mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged up for the place and held. THE COOKIE
MAN unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, drifted in slightly, straightened, then made a steady gain
and edged up for the show late. FUEL THE BERN tracked the pace, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, weakened
late and held a share. ELUSIVE MISCHIEF unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and passed tiring
rivals. UNCLE EARL well placed and between, lost some position three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and flattened out.
SWITHER'S SHORTCUT was never involved. BLACK CANDY well placed and outside, lost some ground three and four wide through the turn, then faded
four wide in the stretch.
