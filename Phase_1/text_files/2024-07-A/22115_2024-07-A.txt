Footnotes
PUTDADDYINACADDY saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through during the drive and was up with a rush in the final strides. HATAGASAL was
bumped at the start by MONGOLIAN SPRING then vied for the lead with THE GOLDEN EGG and ALIANTE from along the inside, drifted out slightly
leaving the three-sixteenths pole and held on gamely during the drive. MONGOLIAN SPRING broke out to bump HATAGASAL then chased the early
leaders, angled out to be four-wide entering the stretch and finished in a mild rally. THE GOLDEN EGG vied for the lead from between horses but lacked the
needed late response. ALLANTE disputed the pace for a half mile while three-wide and weakened. ROPER was allowed to settle, came five-wide into the
stretch and lacked a rally. POCO DIABLO ROJO was reserved off the pace while racing two-wide and tired during the drive.

Footnotes
A LOT OF VERVE prompted the early pace while two-wide, took the lead nearing the five-eighths pole then dueled with SOLDATNA from that point, came
out nearing the wire to bump with that rival and prevailed. SOLDATNA was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, moved up to duel with A LOT OF
VERVE nearing the five-eighths pole, came in slightly nearing the wire to bump with that one and then finished well in a game ttry. AVELLINASA was
unhurried early, came two-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. EARTHLY TIGER was reserved off the early pace, came three-wide into the
stretch and went evenly late. IM GUNNA was forwardly placed, moved up along the inside to offer a bid entering the stretch and then flattened out. POLIS
settled in the middle of the field early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. IBN SINA dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch
and was not a factor. WAITINGATTHEBAR saved ground setting the early pace, stopped badly after a half mile and was eased. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEARING THE WIRE AND THE RIDER OF SOLDATNA ALSO LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST A
LOT OF VERVE BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS RULED THAT SOLDATNA WAS NOT ADVANCING ON THE WINNER AT THAT
STAGE AND MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

NORTHERN LINCHPIN was prominently placed while racing three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and gradually
drew clear. SORORITY PARTY broke out to bump SUMTHINTOTALKABOUT then was allowed to settle, rallied three-wide into the stretch and closed
strongly. SHILSHOLE BAY saved ground setting the pressured pace, responded when headed and held on fairly well for third. TIA SUZI prompted the pace
while racing two-wide but lacked the needed late response. LINCHPIN'S LOCKET broke in to bump SUMTHINTOTALKANOUT then was allowed to settle
while racing three-wide on the turn and failed to seriously threaten. ENGAGING SOUL was reserved off the pace while saving ground and failed to be a
factor. SUMTHINTOTALKABOUT was bumped from both sides and pinched back at the start then was unhurried and failed to menace.
