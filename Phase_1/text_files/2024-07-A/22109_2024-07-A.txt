Footnotes
PRICELESS WILL stalked outside horses along the backside, started to offer a rally inside by the quarter pole closing in, shifted out off the tiring leaders
three wide with runners on both sides for the drive and stubbornly prevailed through the stretch duel to win the photo when crossing the line. LAPOCHKA
settled near the back of the pack, having only one foe beaten down the backstretch, started to pass foes inside at the three eighths marker, shifted out at
the quarter pole, angled to the four path with momentum between horses, determinedly fought to the wire but was denied when just missing the nod for the
win. SPEEDY HANS moved up the rail after the start to engage the pace down the backstretch, was relegated to a chasing role throughout the turn,
resurged on the outside of the frontrunner to bid for the lead in the three path in upper stretch, poked his head in front briefly at the furlong marker but could
not find another gear late to hold off the closing pair in deep stretch and settled for a clear third at the finish line. GRACEFUL FIGHTER was unhurried to
trail the field by many down the back straight, could not make any headway throughout the turn and finished up mildly to split tiring rivals at the sixteenth
pole to settle on the fringes in the end. BLAME J D sat alone, watching the contesting duo down the backstretch, came under a ride three furlongs from the
wire with rivals inside around the bend, was fanned out widest in the five path for the drive but weakened down the stretch. FEELTHEBEAT was away
alertly to seize command leaving the chute, was prompted inside along the backstretch, opened up at the three eighths marker, was clinging onto the lead
when collared outside at the top of the lane, could not find more and folded on the fence at the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
DADDY'S DAISY stalked near the rear three deep outside horses in the early going, started to move around foes, circling five wide at the three furlong pole,
loomed boldly in the four path outside horses turning for home and when encouraged right handed at the furlong marker, wore down the leaders and began
to clear away in deep stretch. MISS WATERLOO chased between runners in early backstretch, was throttled down behind a wall of rivals fighting up front at
the five sixteenths pole, shifted to the rail nearing the quarter pole, rallied smartly on the fence at the top of the lane, briefly lead in mid-stretch but could not
fend off the winner nearing the finish line. STORMY OCEAN tracked behind the lead threesome on the rail at the five furlong pole, took closer order, sitting
behind the pacesetter at the half, darted smartly up the rail finding a seam midpoint around the bend for the lead, dueled between horses having a narrow
margin up top in upper stretch, gave way to the top two leaders at the furlong pole and stayed on to be a clear but non threatening third at the wire. SILENT
PATSY was off a step slow to begin, continued near the back of the pack inside, having one foe beaten down the backstraight, inched closer on the fence
with five sixteenths to run, was steadied sharply inside nearing the quarter pole, lost momentum, shifted from the rail to be three wide at the eighth pole and
under left handed asking, rallied late to collect a minor share in the end. SUMMER HOLIDAY sat alone in mid-pack down the backstretch, closed in at the
three eighths marker to bid in the four path between foes, midway through the turn, was in the hunt three wide in upper stretch but faded at the furlong
marker. SIX FOR A NINE trailed outside to begin, started to offer a mild rally three wide outside the troubled rival at the quarter pole, swung out widest in the
eight path for the drive but could not get involved down the lane. DISGRUNTLEDPELICAN broke sharp for the early lead leaving the chute, pressed the
pace outside down the back straight, dueled for the lead three wide with a barrage of horses at the five sixteenths marker, could not keep up to rivals with a
quarter mile to run and retreated in the three path in upper stretch. SHE IS HOPEFUL veered inwards on the start, recovered quickly to lead on the rail by
the five furlong pole, was engulfed by rivals on both sides in midturn, backed through the field by the quarter pole and galloped across the finish line.
RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #3 SILENT PATSY AGAINST #5 MISS WATERLOO NEARING THE QUARTER POLE WAS DISALLOWED

MO TWILIGHT emerged from the pack to have a clear lead on the rail at the half, dictated terms unopposed up front around the bend, was kept to the task
to the wire and cruised home for the front end score. CEE'NCEESGREYTNESS broke out on the break, stalked outside in the third flight in the early going,
closed in to the place share outside by the quarter pole, was no match for the winner who was long gone in the stretch but while not switching leads down
the lane still bested the rest comfortably at the wire for second money. LANEY GRACE had a stalking role close to the back of the field on the fence, began
to smartly go by runners inside at the seven sixteenths marker, angled out extending her stride three wide at the quarter pole, continued reaching for more
ground in the five path at the top of the lane and finished up with good purpose to be a solid third when crossing the wire. SHES A DARLING broke out at
the start, was situated on the rail in the third flight down the backside, was urged on the fence, keeping pace with rivals at the five sixteenths marker, shifted
out three wide between horses turning for home and ran on mildly for a minor role in the end. QUEEN SAHARA stalked inside near the rear along the
backstretch, made little progression on the turn and found something for the drive three wide in mid-stretch to finish up willingly between runners late.
CHICAGO TYPHOON settled in midfield three deep outside rivals down the back straight, was asked to go on three wide with three eighths from home,
offered little response through the turn, angled widest in the five path straightening for home but could not reach contention down the stretch. DESTIN
NIGHT was bumped inside to begin, tracked in the second flight inside by the half, chased the loose pacesetter but to no avail around the bend, could not
find more for the stretch run and wilted on the fence at the sixteenth pole. CLASSIC GLORY was unhurried early to have only the troubled starter beaten
along the backside, saved ground on the fence through the turn, closing in on runners by the top of the stretch, but was only one paced on the fence driving
to the wire. AMI'S GIRL dwelt at the start, trailed the field by many along the backside, took closer to the pack at the quarter pole and passed a weary
straggler at the top of the lane. KATZ ME OF COURSE was bumped inside at the break, recovered to chase the frontrunning winner down the backside,
was roused for more but was going in the wrong direction by the three eighths marker and emptied out in the three path in upper stretch. STEWARDS
INQUIRY REGARDING THE START OF #7 AMI'S GIRL RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

Footnotes
PERFECT LADY BEE settled off the leader stalking in behind, came out three wide in upper stretch, was put to urging with aim on the leader, lugged out a
bit nearing the sixteenth pole under left-handed urging while rallying, surged late to edge past nearing the wire. ONE FRONT WAR quickly took the lead, set
the pace inside, was reeled in very late and simply outkicked while second best. JUST MAGNIFICENT hopped and was squeezed back at the break, settled
off the pace, gained inside foes in the stretch but needed more. WORSHIP broke outwardly bothering rivals, was well-placed stalking three wide, moved out
a bit further in the stretch and was forced out a tad nearing the sixteenth pole while flattening out. MIDSUMMER MO was in position stalking outside just off
the leaders, raced mostly four to six wide throughout, never fired and was one-paced throughout. HUMBLE HEART broke inwardly and steadied at the start,
soon after shifted in bringing up the rear nearer the inside, was not persevered with in the stretch when hopelessly beaten.

Footnotes
MORAL TURPITUDE co-trailed on the outside in the beginning, settled into stride kindly near the back down the backstretch, started to pick up runners,
circling four wide outside foes at the quarter pole, was full of run widest in the six path in the stretch and surged late, with a well timed rally to get the victory
in a tight photo at the finish. DREAMS AND SCHEMES settled in the third flight with runners on both sides in the beginning, position was unchanged along
the backside but was now outside horses down the backstretch, edged closer to the pacesetter at the quarter pole, closed in three wide between rivals at
the top of the lane, found more when urged left handed at the eighth pole and finished up strongly to just lose the nod at the wire for the win. I HAVE AN
IDEA was loose on the lead on the fence in the first bend, continued to set the pace unchallenged down the back straight, still was in good control leading
the field at the sixteenth pole by a couples of lengths but was caught by the late closers nearing the wire to settle for third money when crossing the finish
line. FOXY DIVA travelled on the rail near the rear in the beginning, closed the gap but position was unchanged along the backside, waited to move behind
horses on the rail around the final turn, shifted to the three path turning for home, finally had clear run four wide between foes at the eighth pole and was
moving very well in deep stretch closing in smartly late. LA PRINCESSA POLLY tracked two wide outside horses down the backside, moved in closer on the
far turn when asked three furlongs out, was in the mix for a share in the two path in upper stretch but finished up evenly late to settle on the fringes in the
end. VILLI OLENTO was content to watch the leader in the first turn, continued to measure the loose pacesetter down the backside, kept pace on the fence
in the final turn, was in the hunt on the rail straightening for home but failed to fire in the final sixteenth. MASON'S MUSIC travelled on the fence in the third
tier for the first half of the race, could not make any impact running throughout the far turn, was in the two path inside foes at the top of the lane for a small
share but lacked a finish down the stretch. HIGH TREASON was uninterested down the backside, seeing the field by many, could not make any impression
inside around the final bend and passed tired runners while on the rail in deep stretch. BRAQUET settled in the third flight outside in the early stages,
improved mildly to track in the second tier three wide at the half, was in range for a piece of the prize in the three path turning for home but faltered at the
furlong marker. SEATTLE CAUSEWAY saved ground early on, getting from the outside post to the two path in the first turn, settled alone in midfield along
the backside on the rail, angled out five wide with the eventual winner to her outside turning for home, could not maintain position, losing her path in upper
stretch and yielded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
ADDENDUM quickly moved clear, set the pace inside, was shadowed by a foe into the turn, found more when put to urging in upper stretch and drew clear
then held well under steady handling. ROYAL BLUSH was bumped at the start, advanced inside foes but off the fence heading to the turn, was nearly
between the leader and outside foe at the top of the stretch two to three wide with aim, proved no match for the former but secured the place.
WEEHAWKEN was within range stalking then pressing the pace of the eventual winner, was just off that one's flank when niggled along past the
three-eighths, made no headway in the stretch, held show. ASHBURY settled off the pace two to three wide through the turn, came out in upper stretch,
kept on late but needed more. RED ELEANOR stalked up close racing in hand, went three to four wide on the turn dropped back late on that bend, fauiled
to rally. KANTBACKOFF bumped the inside foe at the start then exchanged numerous light bumps with the outside rival soon after, advanced inside on the
turn, was in behind and not too far back late on that bend but flattened out. JULIE'S MIST was between foes early, dropped back further on the turn and
faded. HOLIDAY WITH AMY exchanged repeated minor contact with an inside rival just after the start, moved forward outside four to five wide up the
backstretch, dropped back and tired.

Footnotes
KID GIZMO co-trailed on the outside with four furlongs to run, rallied quickly around challengers when coaxed for more in the four path outside horses at the
quarter pole, pounced to the front five wide at the top of the lane, did not switch leads until the seventy yard marker but still held safe comfortably for the win.
LIAM'S AWESOME was situated on the rail in mid-division at the half, waited to go behind runners three furlongs out in the two path, edged closer three
wide by the quarter pole between foes, dove inside to the rail finding clear run at the top of the stretch and closed belatedly to win the duel for the runners up
share. ARYA'S QUEST stalked on the fence near the back of the pack in the beginning, went from the rail three furlongs out to four wide at the quarter pole,
closing the gap smartly through the turn, angled out six wide making a good rally straightening for home but lost the battle for second money in deep stretch.
SILENT PASSION settled at the back between rivals early on, was nudged three wide three furlongs from the wire following the path from a rival making an
early move on the turn, was in range in the five path in upper stretch but finished up only mildly late to be a fringe player in the end. DAISYCREST co-trailed
on the inside at the half mile marker, could not quicken enough when inside with the eventual winner three furlongs from home, angled out in the seven path
for the drive to the wire, lacked a serious stretch bid outside foes to the finish line but did pass some rivals nearing the wire for a better placing. ZIBIBBO sat
alone, watching the top two early on, was forced to move keeping forward position two wide between runners at the three furlong pole, was in the mix up
front in the three path entering the stretch but flattened out with a furlong to go. HASLEMERE travelled in mid-pack three wide outside foes at the half, made
an early move swooping three wide around horses at the three eighths marker to bid for the lead in midturn, poked her head in front momentarily at the
quarter pole, was still in the thick of things in the four path between rivals in upper stretch, could not sustain the rally and retreated with horses on both sides
by the furlong pole. FIREBOLT was content on the rail, watching the pacesetter down the backside, waited behind the frontrunner three furlongs from home,
skimmed the fence turning for home to be in with a chance straightening out for the drive, could not continue on by mid-stretch and yielded by the sixteenth
pole. LA GRIGIA took this field up front along the backside, was collared outside by two rivals midway around the turn, offered little resistance and backed
away through the field when steadied in tight between runners at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
CASTLETON dueled inside for the lead in the early going, cleared to the front alone by the half, was hounded outside by another rival at the three furlong
pole, was nursed along smartly, rationing out her speed to maintain a slim advantage on the fence around the turn, had the lead in the two path with rivals
trying to close in by the eighth pole, was tapped right-handed, had another gear to offer and held off the challenger in deep stretch. THATSITTHATSALL
broke in, causing a ripple effect bumping the two inside rivals at the start, trailed in the beginning, closed in getting a better position inside in the third flight
on the rail by the half, saved ground edging nearer to the leaders through the turn, waited for room on the fence in midturn, shifted out three wide, finding a
seam at the quarter pole, angled out five wide, gathering more momentum turning for home but could not go by the stubborn winner through the stretch.
LADY XI improved position sharply on the rail down the backstretch, tracked just behind the frontrunner on the fence by the half, followed the pacesetting
winner inside through out the turn, had a clear lane on the rail to offer a run down the stretch but was no match for the top two late and settled for the show
money at the wire. ROOKIE COURT broke outwards on the break, tracked the lead trio while three wide outside runners along the backside, took up the
chase to shadow the pacesetter outside three furlongs from home, bid three wide outside at the top of the stretch, was repelled by the frontrunning winner
who had more to offer at the furlong pole and faded slightly late, with a sixteenth remaining to settle for a minor role at the finish line. SMOKEN CHLOE was
bumped outside at the start, pulled the rider between horses in the two path to track the front pair at the half, watched the contesting duo while outside rivals
two wide around the bend, sat just behind the leaders at the top of the lane but needed more in the stretch at the furlong pole to pose a threat in the late
stages. SMILES FOR DAVID was brushed inside on the start, settled four deep outside foes near the back early on, stalked in the third flight three wide
outside runners in this compact bunch at the half, took the overland route three wide around horses three eighths from the wire, stalled in her rally when
pushed out to be four wide by the quarter pole, shifted out further being six wide for the drive to the wire but was one paced in the stretch. PRACTICAL
GIZMO was bumped between horses on the break, travelled in hand settling in midfield three wide down the backstretch, could not match strides with
runners to trail at the three eighths pole, passed a struggling foe inside at the quarter pole but could not get involved in the stretch running. MORE GELATO
dueled outside in the beginning, was relegated to track in the three path between horses at the half, couldn t maintain position and was shuffled back
between horses three furlongs from home, was used up around the turn, trailed by the quarter pole and was not a factor in the stretch drive.
