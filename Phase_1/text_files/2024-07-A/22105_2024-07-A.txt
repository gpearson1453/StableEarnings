Footnotes
GRAY VIXEN was off a step slow then allowed to settle, moved into contention while four-wide nearing the half mile pole, gained the lead nearing the eighth
pole and edged clear late. AFRICAN ANGEL saved ground while being reserved off the early pace, lacked room nearing the quarter pole, angled out to
come three-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. AMUNET saved ground while being unhurried early, waited room briefly nearing the quarter pole,
swung out to be five-wide entering the stretch and rally late. PRIVATE CREDIT saved ground setting the pace into the stretch and weakened slightly late.
LADY HAMILTON prompted the pace while racing two-wide but lacked the needed late response. NORMANDY LIFE settled in the middle of the field while
racing two-wide, came six-wide into the stretch and tired. HAPPYBIRTHDAYCOREY was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, was seven-wide entering
the stretch and gave way. LASTCHANCE ROMANCE dropped back early, bled and was eased then walked off following the race.

handling. FIREBALL EXPRESS prompted the issue while racing three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and finished well for second in a steady effort.
ELL GRAY vied with TAPESTRY COLORS for the lead from along the outside, drifted out slightly leaving the eighth pole and held on well for third. LAVINIA
SPIRIT was reserved off the early pace, came three-wide into the stretch, steadied slightly and altered course to the inside leaving the eighth pole when ELL
GRAY came out and finished willingly. BREEZY DANCE settled in the middle of the field while two-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and finished
willingly. AUNT JO saved ground while racing close-up but lacked a rally ended in a dead-heating with DSOMETHING SALLY for sixtth. SOMETHING
SILLY was allowed to settle, came three-wide into the stretch and ended up on even-terms with AUNT JO without seriously threatening. DON DIVA was
unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. BRACCESCA dropped back early while saving ground and failed to menace. AIKEN
TO BELONG settled in the middle of the pack early while racing three-wide and tired. THE RIDER OF LAVINIA SPIRIT LODGED AN OBJECTION
AGAINST ELL GRAY AND FIREBALL EXPRESS BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.
