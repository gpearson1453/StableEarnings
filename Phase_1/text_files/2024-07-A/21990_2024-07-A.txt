Footnotes
FROSTEDBIRD quickly went to the front, showed the way through the backstretch, repelled a challenge from SILVERFOOT, and edged away deep stretch.
SILVERFOOT stalked the pacesetter from the four path, moved up alongside FROSTEDBIRD to challenge the front but could not muster the bid that was
needed and gave way grudgingly late stretch. AMEER trailed early, drove four wide at the head of the lane, and passed a tiring rival in the stretch. ABOVE
AND BEYOND saved ground inside and failed to threaten.

OOPS AND DOWNS pressed the pace from the three path, was headed at the top of the lane, and drove clear late. WHO'S THAT BABY set a pressured
pace, was overtaken nearing the quarter pole, and held for place. ANNAMARIA raced four to five wide, stalked the pacesetters through the backstretch, and
closed late. KULSUM saved ground early, shifted out to the four path in the backstretch, and failed to threaten. MORNING RAIN lost ground leaving the
opening turn, and lacked a serious bid.

Footnotes
SKIPPER'S PRIDE sat in striking range while three to four wide, shifted down to the rail at the head of the stretch, and won driving inside. TICKET TO THE
TOP showed the way leaving the chute, saved ground while leading the field through the backstretch, responded to a threat from ITSALLGOODMAN, and
was collared late stretch. ITSALLGOODMAN tracked from the rail, swung three wide turning for home, launched an all out bid into the stretch but was
unable to get by TICKET TO THE TOP and weakened. MARAMAX chased four-wide leaving the chute, tracked three wide, and came up empty for the
drive. FORCED TO RUN was not a factor.

VICTORIA'S CHIEF brushed leaving the gate, saved inside, roused five wide at the three-sixteenth pole, closed gamely and was along with time. BRODY'S
PAL brushed away, was reserved off the early pacesetters, drove three wide into the lane gaining the lead and was outkicked. STREET VENDOR raced
four to five wide from the second flight, circled the field and closed well under encouragement. SHINING TIGER chased inside, lacked running room nearing
the quarter pole, slipped through inside in close quarters, and yielded. HANDSOME HENRY allowed to settle early, raced wide through the backstretch, and
bid belatedly. SAWCHUK broke inward brushing VICTORIA'S CHIEF, trailed and passed tiring rivals. HARBOR DANCER dueled for the early lead inside of
TAPFERSURE, held a slim lead nearing the quarter pole, and faltered. TAPFERSURE dueled three wide, and had nothing left late.

Footnotes
SPEEDY PIEDY hurried inside, sat in striking position, chased under steady urging, and won the nod after a multiple horse scramble to the wire. CHICKS
DIG CAPES broke outward, rated off the early pacesetters in the four path, was set down for a drive at the quarter pole, closed gradually under
encouragement, surged in the final yards but was denied by the nose. WORKIN FOR THE MAN crossed over gradually then set the pace, was under a
strong hold leaving the backstretch while under pressure from SPEEDY PIEDY, drew clear in the final turn, was showing signs of tiring while drifting inward
through the stretch and was rundown. OAK BAY QUALITY brushed the gate then was slow away, trailed early, swung outside in the final turn, and offered a
late mild bid. SILVER TIP stalked the pace while three wide, and came up empty in the drive. JOKE IS JOKE was unable to improve position. PRENTON
offered little. JOKERSRWILD AGAIN sat in range while wide through the backstretch, and tired early.

Footnotes
DON'T LET ME DOWN rated well off the pace, shifted out to the four path at the three sixteenth pole, rallied three wide through the stretch while drifting in,
and narrowly prevailed under a long drive. RAILWAY contested the early lead inside of WALKTHELINE, continued to matched strides through the final turn,
battled through the stretch while drifting outward, and lost the bob after a determined effort. COOLWIND gapped early, gained closer order to the field
nearing the final turn, and closed gamely to score show. IT'S A FACT hustled outside into the first turn, rated off the pacesetters, moved up striking position
leaving the backstretch, fanned three wide, and was outkicked through the drive. WALKTHELINE contended the early pace, rallied between rivals through
the stretch then was steadied deep stretch. NORTHERN JEWEL raced at the back of the pack, and encountered traffic late stretch. DRINKING AGAIN
unhurried early, and yielded along the rail late stretch. CREDIBILITY tracked five wide through the backstretch, roused at the quarter pole and came up
empty for the drive. TRAINER OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the trainer of WALKTHELINE against the rider of DON'T LET ME DOWN and
RAILWAY alleging interference deep stretch was not allowed.
