Footnotes
ON A WHIM rated a short lead inside, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, was met toward the quarter and contested at a slim
disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, recovered the edge entering the stretch and dug in determinedly to hold off CALLISTO'S BRIGADE the final
furlong. The latter was bumped leaving the gate then stalked, challenged approaching the three eighths pole, dueled to a brief slim lead toward the quarter
pole, gave up the edge leaving the far turn but stayed on in the lane. STRIVE FOR STRIDE raced in the four path the opening turn, bid nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and dug in to clear third past the eighth pole. ASTRAYAL broke outward and made contact with
Callisto's Brigade then settled back inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and flattened inside the
eighth pole. IRISH FLIGHT rounded the opening turn about the five path and showed little response through the backstretch. SWISS LEGACY stalked the
early pace from the three path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded past the three eighths. This race had a timing discrepancy or
malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
PROTA quickly took the lead and moved to the inside to show the way, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail
and was kept alert in the lane. PYEONG CHANG saved ground on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and
settled for second best. GRAND MANNER stalked off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and
flattened in the lane. EVENT PARTY saved ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, could only improve his position and raced
in the four path on the far turn. MR HOOVER stalked from the four path the first turn, gave chase past the half mile pole but faded into the far turn. NEVER
CHANGE was never a factor. EISELE stalked three wide on the opening turn then faded through the backstretch. This race had a timing discrepancy or
malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
AUBURN MILL exchanged light contact with Golden Appeal leaving the gate then rated the pace inside, came under pressure past the seven sixteenths
pole, was met leaving the quarter but dug in determinedly to recover the nod in later yards. THEWITCHISGONE was brushed leaving the gate then stalked
off the rail, challenged the winner nearing the seven sixteenths pole and dueled to even terms past the quarter, contested the edge most of the far turn and
dueled gamely to mid-stretch before ceding the nod; grudgingly. GOLDEN APPEAL was brushed then jostled lightly leaving the gate, raced in the three path
on the opening turn and gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and dueled through the stretch for third.
WINDSOR'S TRACKER stalked from the three path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and
ran evenly in the lane. MARTIN MAN saved early ground then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced in the five path of the far turn. MASTER
THIS raced off the rail on the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch.
