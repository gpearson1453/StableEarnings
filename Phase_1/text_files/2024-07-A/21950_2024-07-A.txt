TWO MINUTE LICK pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the second turn, closed under steady urging, dueled late and proved best. WATER
WITCH broke out, pressed the pace along the inside, assumed command on the turn, inched away for a short lead, responded to duel late and was
outfinished in a game effort. SHE SO COOL moved up four across on the backstretch, fell back on the turn and finished evenly. MY JO JO was a bit
crowded at the start, was unhurried early and raced in the back, offered a mild bid only along the inside and failed to threaten. KILLARGUE'S GIRL raced in
hand early along the inside, angled out on the second turn, swung wide and gave way. EXAGERADORA was sent to the front to set the pace to the second
turn, tired and stopped.

Footnotes
HARDY CHOICE lagged early, rallied around the turn, bid five wide, closed willingly, veered in at the gap and got up late. BUSTIN UP raced mid pack, bid
between horses on the turn, got a head in front near the gap, led late and was outfinished in a game effort. MONSTER MASON was unhurried early, raced
inside, rallied around the turn, bid willingly, was impeded and steadied near the gap and held for show. SACRED RIDER was unhurried early, advanced on
the turn, was in traffic in the upper stretch, altered course and closed well late. HELMS DEEP set the pace to mid stretch, was unable to sustain his bid and
lost position late. CODE NAME BRODY got away well, vied around the first turn, fell back to stalk the pace along the inside, angled out on the turn and
leveled off in the drive. ALABAMA SLAMMER veered out entering the first turn, was never far back and raced inside, bid along the rail entering the stretch to
get within range and came up empty late. HE'S A SHOOTER was carried out entering the first turn, settled off the pace, showed speed to the second turn
and flattened out. SAL N LOUIE was not a factor. GUNSLINGER (IRE) was checked entering the first turn, never far off the pace, swung wide leaving the
second turn and gave way. MOGALU was a bit fractious in the gate, raced mid pack along the inside and failed to threaten in an even effort. Following a
rider's objection, HARDY CHOICE was disqualified and placed third for causing interference in the stretch.

the pace, rallied five wide into the second turn to loom a threat, fell back, weakened and held safely for show. BOLD MEDICATION settled off the pace,
lacked room entering the second turn, fell back and gave way. GOLDEN GULLEY went six wide along the backstretch, rallied into the second turn, had
nothing left for the drive and gave way. STARDUST ZIGGY trailed the field, swung wide entering the stretch, lacked a bid and passed tiring rivals. SASSY
KING was unhurried early, rallied inside into the second turn, was blocked, steadied and gave way. MINXZHIPPSDONTLEYE pressed the pace while racing
between horses to the second turn, tired and stopped. CREATE AGAIN pressed the pace three across to the second turn, tired and stopped.

MARATHONER vied for the lead, was taken back on the turn, angled out entering the stretch, closed willingly, got up late and was all out at the wire. WORA
raced close to the pace, lacked room into the turn, fell back, came again, got through along the rail leaving the turn, closed willingly and was outfinished in a
game effort. ROCKINGHAM JOE raced close to the pace, was crowded and steadied leaving the turn, lacked the needed late rally and held for show.
PALLINO vied to the turn, inched clear, led to late stretch, faltered and lost position. SCIENCE (IRE) was unhurried early, shifted out in the upper stretch
and found his best stride late. HE'S IN CHARGE advanced to the turn, bid willingly, was crowded at the gap and leveled off. GOLDEN ARM pressed the
pace towards the outside, challenged for the lead on the turn, fell back and veered out at the gap. SUNSET TOWN was not a factor. BAM BAM BLU raced
in close early, fell back, was crowded and checked at the gap and dropped further back. The rider of ROCKINGHAM JOE claimed foul against the rider of
MARATHONER for alleged interference entering the stretch. No change was made.

Footnotes
COUPERIN stalked the leader from the two path, called up nearing the quarter pole, went clear in upper stretch, switched over to his left lead late, held safe
driving. BAD HOMBRE took a hard bump at the start, saved ground into far turn, clean running room when called on in upper stretch, needed more through
the wire. SIDNEY'S BID set a pressured pace along the inside, lost ground around the far turn, lugged out sharply in upper stretch, regained stride nearing
the furlong marker, and leveled off late. BAD HENRY raced off the pace and in the five path around the first turn and down the back stretch, urged along
leaving the three eighths pole, no late gain. BRYSONS OPTION tracked the leaders from the three path, put to task in upper stretch, came up empty.
