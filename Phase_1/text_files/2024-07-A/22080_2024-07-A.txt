late. WILDCAT MINNY tracked the pace setters on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the three path and chased on to the wire.
WHERE'S MARILYN pressed the pace between horses through the opening quarter, continued around the turn in the two path and kept on in the lane.
COMPETITIVE NATURE raced off the pace on the outside early, ran out coming around the bend, entering the stretch in the middle of the track and never
threatened. PEPPER N MINT dueled on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faded in the stretch. DASHING DARLING hit the
gate leaving it, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and made no bid.

BLUESKIESANDANGELS chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and dug in in the lane to hold the win
after drifting some late. SCOOTER'S BOY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, continued around the turn in the three path, began a bid
passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. DRISKILL led the way up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and weakened in the final
furlong. ROCKYMOUNTAINTWIST raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter, came around the bend in the two path and made no bid.
FERRARI ROAD raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, trailed the field while saving ground around the bend and was not a factor.
