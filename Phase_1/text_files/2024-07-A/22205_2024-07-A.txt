Footnotes
SHE'S A KEEPER quick to the front, well rationed throughout, held on gamely late. EASTERN SUNRISE chased winner throughout, cutting in to lead late,
missed on wire. LUCKY LESSON no speed to far turn, mild traffic into stretch, angled out and finished up with good energy to the wire. SONHO DE VERAO
saved ground throughout with minimal energy in the stretch run. IN A PEACH saved ground to stretch, angled out for clear run, good energy. HONEYTOWN
bobbled from gate, ran into traffic far turn, stretch good energy. SPLIT DECISION bobbled a bit from the gate with no speed to far turn, improved. HAMMER
AND JAMMER never menaced throughout. AUTISM COMPASSION good position to far turn with nothing left and faded back. SUBTLE SENORITA never a
menace throughout. OH POLLYANNA always back with no response. LINDSY'S SHADOW tried to keep up three quarters with nothing left, dropped back
readily.
