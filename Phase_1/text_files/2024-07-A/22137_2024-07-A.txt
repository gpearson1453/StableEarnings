all out drive to the wire, went clear late. MOON ME AGAIN tracked the pace from along the inside, angled off the rail around the bend, took the leading roll
into the stretch, was out kicked to the wire. FANCY PRINCESS vied for the lead along the inside, under pressure nearing the quarter pole, lost ground to
outside rival in upper stretch, fought on briefly inside, finished the final yards evenly. OLIVE KAT vied between runners into the turn, under a drive while
between runners leaving the quarter pole, came up empty late. THUNDER BOSS step slow leaving the gate, pressed hard to gain inside position, under a
drive nearing the quarter pole, steadily faded to the wire.
