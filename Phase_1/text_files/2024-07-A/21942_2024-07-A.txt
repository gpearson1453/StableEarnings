PERFECT MOON pressed early chasing to lane hooking foe drawing out late inside. LORD ANTE set the pace to upper stretch being hooked from the
inside there proving no match. LETMEKNOWBEFOREUGO was squeezed stumbling at the break, lagging through the turn responded down the lane to
finish well on the rail. FREE RAMBLING MAN chased through the turn weakening in upper stretch. ANDYLITHIC raced evenly lacking more. MY BUDDY
MICAH was never involved. ENOUGH ICE played no factor. GUARDIANSOF AUTISM hustled along would give way in upper stretch. S S TRACKSIDE
FUN flashed early speed then gave way on the turn.
