SHOWCASE bobbled at the break, chased four then three wide advancing under coaxing near the quarter pole to take command, swung six then five wide
straightened away into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. PROTECTED shied in at the start forcing CYCLONE STATE to steady off his
heels, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front and swung three wide into upper stretch, dug
in under a drive no match for the top one while keeping on to just preserve the place honors on the wire. TIZ FREEDOM struck the near side stall at the
start, then got bumped by CYCLONE STATE and conceded about two lengths to the front, chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under
coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, kept on under a drive and just missed for the place honors. CYCLONE STATE broke
inwards brushing the near side stall and then bumping TIZ FREEDOM before being forced to steady off the heels of PROTECTED who shied inwards
directly in front, conceded four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased five the four wide offering up a bid five-sixteenths from home,
angled seven wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. JERRY'S OUT coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths and strode greenly taking an awkward stride near the five-sixteenths, had the rider eased off and went four wide for home, received some
taps to the right shoulder through the stretch and leveled out late to make some ground and trailed.

Footnotes
DOMESTIC PRODUCT stalked the pace on the outside, ranged up three wide to make a bid on the turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole, took the lead
into upper stretch then kicked clear, drifted in when the rider un-cocked his crop with the right-hand near the furlong marker, widened along the rail then was
given one pop of a left-handed crop coming to the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under a solid hand-ride from that point to the finish. HADES
showed speed then tracked the pace under coaxing, chased in the two path early on the turn, moved to the four path while dropping back near the
five-sixteenths pole, spun five wide into the stretch and safely secured the place. BILLAL was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch,
was asked under threat while inside on the turn, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch and
tired. SAVE THE TREES settled at the rear of the quartet, was roused while moving from three to five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and
failed to respond.

LOW SOCIETY showed speed then chased the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the three to four path on the turn, took the advantage into upper
stretch, fought outside of the runner-up to the finish and prevailed under steady handling. PLAY GOOD PAY GOOD was hustled to the front, showed the
way down the backstretch, vied in the two to three path on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch,
fought on well with that opponent to the finish but missed while clear for the place. FIVE TO TWO chased the pace on the outside, went around the turn in
the four to five path, pursed the top two under a drive in the stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to secure the show. PROGENY was urged along
off the pace, moved up between foes near the nine-sixteenths pole, chased in the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, pursued the
top two into the final furlong and weakened. GRAMMY GIRL broke a step slow, moved up towards the inside then settled off the pace, angled out while
dropping back leaving the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. YOU'RE FOREVER moved in while urged
along off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and capitulated. PER NEW YORK GAMING COMMISSION RULING
NOTICE NUMBER AQ 52-2024, LOW SOCIETY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND ORDERED UNPLACED DUE TO CARRYING TWO POUNDS

Footnotes
AMUNDSON broke in a step bumping GENTLEMAN JOE in concert with WRITER'S REGRET when coaxed from the gate, dueled with WRITER'S
REGRET down the backstretch from the two path, eased off that rival near the five furlong marker before coming again inside the half mile pole tipped three
wide through the turn, took over command inside the five-sixteenths and swung four wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail.
GENTLEMAN JOE got bumped between foes at the start, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into
upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. SIX PERCENT chased along the inside and was patiently handled until set down angled out seven wide
into upper stretch, then offered up a mild bid to secure the show honors. WRITER'S REGRET broke out at the start bumping GENTLEMAN JOE in tandem
with AMUNDSON, came under coaxing and dueled inside of AMUNDSON, had that rival ease off and tipped to the two path into the turn getting engaged
once more in a duel as that rival came again, tucked inside and got placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front and spun two to three wide into
upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. NOTABLE BOB (CHI) chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, trailed.

Footnotes
TRIKARI established a forward position early, went around the first turn in the two path, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the
far turn, took a short lead in upper stretch, dueled outside of the runner-up in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. WHITE
PALOMINO went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace on the inside, responded well when asked on the second turn, lost the advantage to the
winner under a drive in upper stretch, dueled gamely with that foe in the final furlong and just missed. LEGEND OF TIME (GB) was last to commence from
the inside post, saved ground while rated off the pace, drafted behind horses on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then moved to the two path,
chased behind the leading duo into the final sixteenth, moved out some for clear pace in front late and willingly earned the show. ROYAL MAJESTY (GB)
was taken in hand early then reserved in the two path, drafted in the two path while let out on the far turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, chased the
leading duo on the outside while keeping LEGEND OF TIME behind those foes into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked. ENDLESSLY was taken in hand
early, traveled around the first turn in the three path, was unhurried at the rear, came under strong encouragement in the two path early on the far turn,
moved to the three path late on that bend, was driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
MULLIKIN pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took the lead inside the five-sixteenths pole, came under a right-handed crop
while battling inside of the runner-up in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best under strong urging.
COASTAL MISSION dropped back after the start then settled on the outside, ranged up four wide on the turn, made a bid near the five-sixteenths pole,
battled outside of the winner under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop near the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while
clear for the place. NINETYPRCENTMADDIE broke out then dropped back, moved out at the rear then was urged along on the outside, went five wide on
the turn, pursued the top two while remaining on his inside lead in the stretch and lacked the needed kick but was clear for the show. EVERSO
MISCHIEVOUS was hustled from the gate, established a good position just off the pace, was asked while inside on the turn then chased, moved to the two
path outside the quarter-pole then was driven three wide into the stretch, moved further out in the drive and came up empty. PREVALENCE was hustled to
the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path for most of the turn, lost the advantage inside the five-sixteenths then dropped to
the inside and tired.

CINDERELLA'S DREAM (GB) settled just off the inside near the rear of the field and was patiently handled until placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths as
rivals got busy around her, angled out seven wide into upper stretch placed to a drive and was forced to alter out a path as DYNAMIC PRICING altered out
to her inside from pressure from PIN UP BETTY, offered up a good finish to close with a rush outside and shied inwards under a right handed crop a
sixteenth from home, collared the duel up front and seized command inside the final seventy yards to score in course record time. SEGESTA established
the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside through sensible splits patiently handled through to near the quarter pole when
placed to light coaxing confronted to the outside, went three wide into upper stretch and was roused near the three-sixteenths, dug in dueling with SHE
FEELS PRETTY through to the finish getting overthrown as a pair just inside seventy yards to go and gamely fended off her main stretch rival to preserve
the place honors by a nostril. SHE FEELS PRETTY settled tracking the leader just off the inside moving into closest aim through the first turn, remained
patiently handled until placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole issuing a challenge for command, swung four wide into upper stretch set down for the
drive, dug in engaging in head to head combat through the length of the stretch fighting on gamely to the finish but was ultimately caught in concert with her
main stretch rival by the top one in the final jumps and then bested for the place honors on the wire by a sliver. PIN UP BETTY tracked the pace along the
inside waited with until set down angled four wide into upper stretch, tipped out five wide straightened away forcing DYNAMIC PRICING to alter out a path
and in turn CINDERELLA'S DREAM to do the same, dug in running on with good energy to the finish briefly altering inwards when CINDERELLA'S DREAM
shied in a sixteenth out and was along for the last major share. SECRET SATIRE (GB) coaxed from the gate, grew rank under restraint in behind foes past
the stands and into the first turn before settling to track along the inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go and spun just
off the inside into upper stretch, stayed on one paced through to the finish. BUCHU just off the inside through the first turn, chased three to four wide down
the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, angled out eight wide at the head of the stretch, offered no
response. DYNAMIC PRICING (IRE) got away to an awkward beginning, raced along the inside through the first turn and then chased two to three wide
from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and was forced to alter out a path by PIN UP BETTY
straightened away and in turn forced CINDERELLA'S DREAM to alter a path, then offered no kick. SY B broke out at the start and was corrected, settled
just off the inside at the tail of the field, tucked inside through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and came up empty. FUN WITH FLAGS (IRE) settled just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home,
angled five wide at the top of the stretch and weakened through to the finish.

Footnotes
CAPTURE THE FLAG was taken under a tight hold while into the bit early, went around the first turn in the two path, was rated off the pace, drafted in the
two then three path on the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, moved out while in pursuit of the leader, gained to make a bid into the final sixteenth
and got up under strong handling. VICTORS VALIANT dropped in before the first turn, settled on the inside, was asked on the far turn, moved out in upper
stretch, chased into the final furlong then dropped in, gained inside of foes to make a bid into the final sixteenth but missed while narrowly up for the place.
ALEXIS ZORBA (GB) went to the front, raced inside on the first turn, showed the way off the rail on the backstretch, went around the far turn in the two path,
was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, led gamely until outside the sixteenth-pole then was headed, battled between
foes in the final sixteenth and was outfinished. MISSION NORTH stalked the pace on the outside in the three path, was given his cue on the far turn, made
a bid at the quarter-pole, fought outside of the runner-up while remaining on his inside lead until near the sixteenth-pole, swapped to the proper lead at that
juncture, battled between foes in the final sixteenth and was outfinished. GHOSTLYPRINCE saved ground while settling at the rear, came off the rail late on
the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. COMPLETE AGENDA was urged along early, went three wide on
the first turn, settled on the outside, traveled three wide on the far turn, drifted in near the furlong marker and failed to respond.

Footnotes
TAP TO MISCHIEF coaxed from the gate, got bumped along the rail due to pressure from rivals tucking in from the outside putting the squeeze on a quartet
to his outside just outside the five furlong marker, chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into
upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in under late threat and held safe to prevail. CREDITWORTHY raced three wide early on and was
bumped between foes and forced to check out near the five furlong marker when TWO TONS OF FUN came in from the outside conceding three to four
lengths of ground and position before recovering at the tail of the field tucked to the two path, tucked inside into the far turn and came under coaxing three
furlongs from home, angled six wide into upper stretch, closed well and with good courage to latch on the aforementioned foe as he hit the finish. CUANDO
got bumped between foes just off the inside near the five-eighths due to pressure outside from TWO TONS OF FUN tucking inwards, chased along the
inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. PROSPERO (IRE) chased three then two
wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight to nine wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to the finish. MASTER FREUD coaxed from
the gate, showed the way lightly coaxed along the inside and then just off the inside, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and
was collared a furlong out, weakened in the late stages. RESEARCH RESULTS chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing
at the three-eighths, angled seven to eight wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outfinished. SIDE EYE chased three then two wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened. TWO TONS OF FUN coaxed from the gate, tucked inwards bumping
CREDITWORTHY in the three path and beginning a chain of bumping rivals down through to the rail in LIVEHAPPY, CUANDO and TAP TO MISCHIEF
near the five furlong marker and squeezed out CREDITWORTHY when impeding that foe forcing him to check at that station, steadily tucked to chase just
off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and made no impact. LIVEHAPPY got
bumped between foes near the five-eighths marker due to pressure from the aforementioned foe, chased just off the inside, got out into the turn four then
five wide and was under a right handed crop seven-sixteenths from home before being hard held to not get out any further, bolted from the five-sixteenths
through the latter portion of the turn to the outside fence under a hard protective hold and was eased along to the finish being steadily pulled up while
headstrong well behind, then walked off under his own power.
