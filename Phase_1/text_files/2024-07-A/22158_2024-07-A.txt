Footnotes
FLY SOUTH was a step slow away from the start, settled off of the decent early pace while not far back, maintained an outside path entering the turn and
chased five wide nearing the quarter pole, roused into the stretch, closed determinedly past mid-stretch, wore down the stubborn runner-up in the final
sixteenth and surged to prevail in deep stretch. SHADOWED THOUGHTS sent to establish the early lead, assumed command and set a pressured pace
heading to the half-mile, shook free into the turn and was well handled along the bend, maintained a clear lead into the stretch, kept to task past the furlong
marker, met the bid of FLY SOUTH entering the final sixteenth, stubbornly battled into deep stretch and was bested in the final strides, while holding clear
for second. C HER BEAUTY broke alertly, was hustled away from the gate and chased the decent early pace from the inside, ran in pursuit while saving
ground into the turn, shifted two wide at the quarter marker and chased into the stretch, could not match strides with the top pair into the final sixteenth and
was clear for third. BRONZE'S FLOWER showed speed away from the start, pressed the decent early pace outside of SHADOWED THOUGHTS, chased
the pacesetter into the turn, lost position while between runners nearing the quarter marker, gave way into the stretch and could not muster a late response.
This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
AMANOFMYSTATURE rated nicely off of the early pace and stalked from the outside heading to the half-mile pole, was well placed entering the turn and
chased the moderate pace three wide approaching the quarter, ran in pursuit into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, rallied past mid-stretch
and drew to even terms with THUNDER OF ZION into the final sixteenth, wore down the game runner-up in deep stretch and pushed past in the final strides
for a determined win. THUNDER OF ZION was a step slow away from the start, sent to establish the early lead, assumed command and set a pressured
pace heading to the half-mile marker, carved out moderate fractions while under pressure nearing the quarter pole, shook free into the stretch, met the bid
of AMANOFMYSTATURE into the final sixteenth, grudgingly gave way in deep stretch and held safely in the end for second. IMPLICITLY allowed to settle
in the early running, saved ground into the turn and was content to trail approaching the quarter pole, gained ground into the stretch, shifted to the two path
and rallied into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the top pair in deep stretch and held for third at the finish. GORDY'S BOY broke alertly, vied for the early
lead then ceded the front to THUNDER OF ZION and pressed that rival through moderate fractions heading to the half-mile, attended to the pace two wide
into the turn, lost position into the stretch and chased at the furlong marker, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. This
race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

HANG ON hustled away from the start, ceded the early lead to MINERAL RIGHTS and stalked that rival from the outside entering the first turn, attended to
the moderate pace through the backstretch run, was roused three wide into the far turn and took a narrow lead at the quarter pole, dug in into upper stretch
and kept foes at bay nearing the furlong marker, kept to task into the final sixteenth and lasted in deep stretch for a determined win. MAMARANDO allowed
to settle away from the start, raced between runners into the backstretch and was well placed nearing the half-mile marker, continued to race between rivals
into the far turn and chased heading to the quarter pole, gained ground into upper stretch, shifted out a path for the drive then came in tight at the furlong
marker, vied between rivals past mid-stretch, was kept at bay in the final sixteenth and held well for second at the finish. LOOKOUT PASS unhurried in the
early stages, gained ground into the backstretch run, was steered outside of rivals entering the far turn and gained ground three to four wide nearing the
quarter marker, continued his steady advance into the stretch, was outkicked by the top pair in the final sixteenth and was clear at the finish for third.
MINERAL RIGHTS showed good speed away from the start, assumed command into the first turn and set moderate fractions into the backstretch run,
dictated terms into the far turn while off of the rail, was overtaken nearing the quarter pole and battled into the stretch, could not keep pace past the furlong
marker and gave way in the late stages. TIZTHEHARTOFDIXIE reared at the start and spotted the field away from the gate, saved ground while allowed to
settle into the first turn, maintained an inside path through the backstretch run, mounted a rail bid into the far turn and came within aim at the quarter marker,
could not sustain that run into the stretch and flattened out. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the
most accurate time.

Footnotes
LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) tracked close up while racing in the three to four path, held steady to the far turn then launched a bid from the five-sixteenths pole,
loomed on the outside of three horses across the track turning for home, finished well under steady handling, gained the advantage in deep stretch and just
held. STONE'S RIVER seized the lead out of the gate when the rest held back, then was allowed to dictate the fractions while getting some pressure to the
outside from SUGAR BEETS, fought back when challenged by that foe and LORD WIMBORNE at the top of the stretch, was inside as the three contested
the issue down the stretch, kept on under left handed urging then drifted out slightly inside the sixteenth pole and made light contact with SUGAR BEETS
and held the place. SUGAR BEETS came away in good order and took up a stalking position just behind and to the outside of STONE'S RIVER, pressing
the pace a little without wanting to take the lead through the early stages, went to challenge that foe on the far turn approaching the five-sixteenths pole,
then was between three horses contesting the issue at the top of the stretch, took a bump from STONE'S RIVER inside the sixteenth pole and lost some
momentum just before the wire. J T'S WATCH broke a little awkwardly to the inside and was slow to get going, spotted the field several lengths in the early
going, was never able to mount a rally and trailed throughout. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the
most accurate time.

Footnotes
MORO FIRST CLASS broke alertly then rated nicely off of the solid early pace, was guided three wide into the turn and advanced at the quarter marker,
mounted a four to five wide rally into the stretch and took a narrow lead at the furlong marker, lost the lead to THE GREAT HAYNES past mid-stretch,
determinedly came again into the final sixteenth, dueled on even terms with the game runner-up in deep stretch and prevailed in the final strides for a gallant
win. THE GREAT HAYNES took back off of the solid early pace, was guided two wide into the turn and gained ground at the quarter pole, was roused into
the stretch, loomed nearing the furlong marker and split rivals at mid-stretch, engaged with MORO FIRST CLASS past the furlong pole, took a narrow lead
with dueling that rival into the final sixteenth, gamely battled into deep stretch and just missed for the win, while well clear of the rest for second. LA PRIMER
ESTRELLA hard sent leaving the start, engaged with SUPERSONIC FLYER in the early stages and contested a solid pace outside of that rival heading to
the half-mile, dueled through decent fractions into the turn and went two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, vied for the lead into the stretch, lost
position past the furlong marker, yielded to the top pair in the final sixteenth and was a clear third. YODERANDO allowed to settle away from the start, was
void of early speed and lagged in the opening quarter, raced two to three wide into the turn and trailed at the quarter marker, roused four to five wide into the
stretch, found her best stride late but could not threaten the leaders in the final sixteenth. SUPERSONIC FLYER hustled away from the start, was engaged
in the early going by LA PRIMER ESTRELLA and contested the solid pace with that rival heading to the half-mile marker, carved out decent fractions while
dueling into the turn, lost position into the stretch and faded in the final furlong. EM N HOLL'S FIESTA took back off of the solid early pace, settled along the
inside and saved ground into the turn, advanced at the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, could
not sustain her run into the final sixteenth and flattened out. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the
most accurate time.

Footnotes
FORD FLYER was hustled out of the gate but could not keep up with the early pacesetters despite the best efforts of the rider, got into a good rhythm
passing the half-mile marker then navigated a clever path between horses through the turn, came into the stretch in a three wide bid for the lead, took
command in upper stretch and was pulling clear in the end. CONEJO MALO broke sharply and was first out of the gate, led through the initial stages then
ceded the lead to TOP WOLF while staying close up on the inside, got a nice inside run into the stretch, proved no match for the winner but outfinished TOP
WOLF for the place. TOP WOLF rushed to the front from the break, set a pressured pace through the early stages, gave way between horses in upper
stretch but kept on well enough to hold third. RED RAJ was outrun from the break and had be ridden to keep close to the pack, dropped further behind
going into the turn, then found another gear passing the three furlong marker, began to rally, tipped out to the four path for clear run down the stretch and
improved. THIRSTY LOV broke a step slow but advanced into contention down the backstretch, kept to the inside, had some trouble keeping up when the
pace quickened near the three furlong pole, flattened out in the stretch and finished evenly. HARTMAN broke well and was under some pressure to contend
the early pace while racing three wide down the backstretch, weakened passing the three furlong came under heavy pressure and had nothing to offer in the
stretch. TRIBAL STAR was fractious in the gate, the was slow into stride as the field was dispatched, responded when pushed on and raced close up while
four wide down the backstretch then lost interest, dropped to last was not persevered with and allowed to gallop out to the wire. This race was originally
hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
