Footnotes
INVARIABLY raced in the middle of the pack from seven wide to the turn then moved in to three wide around the turn while continuing to move up and drove
past the leaders in deep stretch to clear late. TEXAS TURBINE rushed up between horses to take a pressured lead then dueled around the turn and into
deep stretch but was outfinished by outside closer. BIG FIG vied for the lead from three wide to the turn then dueled to deep stretch but was outkicked late.
CHELSEA DAGGER showed no early speed the raced up the rail around the turn, angled out to two wide in the stretch to make the late gain but was not
enough. VORTEX hustled along to press the pace from the inside to the five sixteenths pole and weakened. SILKY'S DANCE raced near the back from six
wide to the turn then tipped in to three wide around the turn but was never a factor. J'S LITTLE MAN was fractious in the gate then raced off the pace from
four wide to the half mile marker and retreated. PEPPERONIKID stalked the pace from five wide to the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
CHEAPSKATE DIVA went to the front to set the pace from a clear lead and held position. BIRDIE CALL prompted the pace from two wide and was never
far back off the leader while giving an even effort. TENSAS CANDY tracked the leaders through the final turn from two wide, shifted inside at the eighth pole
for a late run but was too late. EVE'S DELIGHT raced off the pace on the inside then made a mild bid on the final turn but was outfinished. LADY
JEOPARDY stalked the pace from three wide to the middle of the final turn and faded. GASTOWN was allowed to settle around the first turn made a mild
bid on the final turn but flattened out in the stretch. MIDNIGHT BELLA raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground around the first turn then raced
three wide down the backstretch but was never a factor. MARINA'S GOLD had a dull effort. ZING was always back.

LADY ATHENA roused to the front to vie for the lead from three wide then moved up to engage the leader entering the turn and match strides outside of IN
B. J.'S HONOR to upper stretch then drew off in the stretch. GOLDEN CITY showed no early speed then moved up from two wide and kept on to be second
best. DELIGHTFUL HALO raced off the pace early then moved between horses near the three furlong marker, tipped out to three wide in upper stretch but
was outkicked in the drive. IN B. J.'S HONOR sprinted away to press the pace from two wide to the turn then matched strides inside of LADY ATHENA to
upper stretch and weakened. LITTLEBITOFAQUEEN had an awkward start and trailed the field by many length and passed tired ones in the stretch. NIGHT
TIZZY was hustled away from the gate the settled in the middle of the pace, made a mild bid on the turn but gave way. CLASSIC DEAL rushed up to show
the early speed to the half mile marker and was done.
