Footnotes
FONTANAFREDDA angled in early then settled nicely off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path while drafting behind foes on the turn, was roused
outside the quarter-pole, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed well to make a bid under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, took the lead
inside that marker and edged clear under good handling. MAGGIE T pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two then three path on the turn, took the
lead passing the five-sixteenths pole, was asked into the stretch, began to drift out under pressure nearing the furlong marker, continued to drift out until
near the sixteenth-pole while overtaken then clearly secured the place. WILLFUL DESIRE went to the front, showed the way with company to her outside,
vied along the rail on the turn, was headed passing the five-sixteenths pole, turned into the stretch in the two path, chased the leader into the final furlong
and drifted out while weakening. AWESOME ANNMARIE tossed her head at the start and was off slow, steadied repeatedly while tossing her head rankly
off heels early then finally moved to the outside, rushed up under some restraint to get near the leaders with five furlongs to run, dropped back under urging
late on the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn, floated six wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
SPIRIT OF ST LOUIS coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed along the inside until tipped to the two path into the first turn, attended the leader to the
outside two then three wide down the backstretch patiently handled, advanced on that foe through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole,
swung three wide into upper stretch, seized command with about three-sixteenths to go and edged clear under a drive to prevail. DAKOTA GOLD saved
ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick.
ITSALLCOMINTOGETHA coaxed from the gate, established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand crossing to the inside into the first
turn, remained on hold until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole under threat for the initial time, spun just off the inside into upper stretch confronted by
the top one, yielded the front with about three-sixteenths to go and kept on to the finish and was along for the show honors. CITY MAN settled tracking the
front just off the inside and then along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, shied out two paths under a
left handed crop in upper stretch with about three-sixteenths remaining, had the rider switch hands and came inwards slightly under a right handed crop
near the furlong marker while offering up a late bid inside that station, then got taken in hand in the final five strides to the finish and missed for the show
honors. JERRY THE NIPPER coaxed from the gate, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
TYPHOON FURY brushed with a rival at the start, settled on the outside, moved closer while two then three wide on the turn, was roused four wide into the
stretch, rallied outside to get the lead coming to the furlong marker, disposed of the runner-up near the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under strong
handling. BETTA GO GO GO was coaxed along on the outside, chased in the two then three path on the turn, gained under a drive in upper stretch, made a
bid nearing the furlong marker, battled with the winner until near the sixteenth-pole then was outfinished while clear for the place. WIZARDOFEZ bobbled at
the start then ducked in, spotted the front a few lengths, was urged along off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, raced between horses passing
the five-sixteenths pole, was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while up for the show. ARTETA showed speed then sped
clear, went around the turn in the two path, was asked outside the quarter-pole, came under the crop in upper stretch, was collared approaching the furlong
marker and weakened then was caught for the show. CRASH THE GATE broke out and bumped lightly with a foe, settled off the pace, raced inside early on
the turn, was shuffled a touch behind GOLD 'N' SCARLET when that foe dropped back then shifted to the two path over heels around the five-sixteenths
pole, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved out near the sixteenth-pole and failed to rally. PICCATA PRINCE was ridden along towards the rear,
went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. HOURS IN A DAY was bumped lightly at the start, dropped well
behind the rest of the field, went around the turn in the two path, came out into the stretch and showed little. GOLD 'N' SCARLET broke out a bit and
brushed with an opponent, was well placed behind the solo leader, dropped back along the rail on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
SANTAGATA coaxed from the gate, vied from the four path with a pair of foes before being shaken off a bit by EMPIRE MAGIC five furlongs from home,
prompted that rival from the outside and tucked three wide into the turn advancing under coaxing to issue a challenge and was carried out six wide into
upper stretch, came inwards and bumped his main rival when switching leads just outside the three-sixteenths, then edged clear to the finish to prevail.
EMPIRE MAGIC coaxed from the start, vied early on from the two path with a pair of rivals, established sole command five furlongs from home and faced
some pressure from a pair latched on to the outside before briefly shaking away into the turn, came under pressure from the aforementioned foe to the
outside and came under a drive with five-sixteenths to go, swung five wide into upper stretch carrying his main danger six wide, got bumped straightened
away and then proved no match for that rival while along clear for the place honors. GREGORIAN SOLO away well and to the front when coaxed from the
gate, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. WATCH OVER ME
vied three wide with a pair early on before briefly prompting and then chasing three wide, tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. HARMONYVILLE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung three wide into upper stretch, tired. FUNNY FORECAST broke a beat slow and then was sluggish early on three wide growing detached at the tail of
the field, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SILVER SKILLET went to the front then quickly opened up a sizable advantage, dropped to the inside early on the first turn, showed the way down the
backstretch, controlled the action while inside on the far turn, responded well when set down near the three-sixteenths pole, extended the advantage under
a strong hand-ride into the final furlong, came under a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole, drew off under strong urging into the final sixteenth,
swapped back to her inside lead late and proved much the best. LISA'S VISION went around the first turn in the two path, followed the solo leader from
second, moved closer midway down the backstretch, was asked in the two path while tracking the winner on the far turn, chased that foe under a drive into
the final furlong and proved no match while clear for second. MARVELOUS MAUDE saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved closer
midway down the backstretch, was asked while moving from the rail to the three path on the far turn and lacked the needed response. SNOWY EVENING
dropped back early, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside, moved closer midway down the backstretch, was urged three then four
wide on the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch and also lacked the needed response then just missed third position.

Footnotes
DANCING BEAR bobbled at the start recovering and veering outwards bumping NOTFANUTIN with a glancing blow into ORIE and in turn into SHOOT THE
WAVES and SKY MASTERSON, crossed to show the way in hand along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch let out for the drive, edged clear to the eighth pole, dug in and held well and clear to the finish kept to task. MCDIESEL
coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside patiently handled until roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, attempted to tip out with
three-sixteenths to go and refused the tip despite the rider utilizing a left handed crop and a right rein, attempted again to angle out a furlong out and
refused the move a second time and ran on married to the rail through to the finish. RICHARD AVE chased three then two wide patiently handled until set
down angled four to five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and offered up a mild kick. ORIE bumped between foes at the start, chased along the
inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. SKY
MASTERSON got bumped in a chain of bumps begun by DANCING BEAR at the start, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled four to five wide for home and passed tired rivals. CADDIEMASTER broke in striking the near side stall at the start, chased four wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. MAN FROM MALTA away well, raced two to three wide in
closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. NOTFANUTIN got
bumped at the start by DANCING BEAR and in turn bumped ORIE into SHOOT THE WAVES and SKY MASTERSON, chased just off the inside under
coaxing from the three-eighths, bid three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the stretch. SHOOT THE WAVES got bumped between foes and steadied
out at the start, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. I'M

Footnotes
SCORING CHANCE was last into stride, moved out while urged along near the back, angled further out near the nine-sixteenths pole, went four wide on the
turn, rallied six wide into the stretch, closed fast to get the lead before the eighth-pole, battled with the runner-up to the finish and narrowly prevailed under
strong urging. BIG HAZEL showed early speed, contested the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, came under the crop in upper
stretch, battled gamely to the finish and just missed while able to get the place. CAROL T settled just off the pace on the inside, saved ground on the turn,
found room along the rail in upper stretch, gained to make a bid near the furlong marker, battled inside of three opponents into the final sixteenth and was
outfinished while just able to get the show. FOXY CARA was urged along at the rear on the far outside, went five wide on the turn, rallied seven wide into
the stretch, closed well to make a bid in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, battled under a drive into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked then just
missed the show. SCARLET'S DREAM dropped just off the pace then was well spotted, went around the turn in the two path, chased behind horses in
upper stretch, raced in tight between foes into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. AMY'S LIGHT was well placed just off the pace, dropped back
near the nine-sixteenths, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, went two to three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, drifted out
outside the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response. CAPITAL GAL tracked the pace on the outside, was given her cue while four then three wide on

Footnotes
ETERNAL SILENCE settled just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and was set down spinning four wide into upper
stretch, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, edged away under a drive to the finish. MRS. ASTOR got bumped at the start by SACRED IMAGE,
who broke inwards, and in turn bumped LULLABY LAND, tracked the pace along the inside, came under coaxing tipped to the two path near the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. IN TIME (FR) coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace of
COLLABORATION from the outside in the two path, got let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, seized command straightened away, dug in under
threat and was collared near the eighth pole, kept on to preserve the show honors. SACRED IMAGE broke in at the start bumping MRS. ASTOR into
LULLABY LAND, tracked the pace just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled three to four wide into
upper stretch and improved position to the finish. A NEW PEACE tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. HOLA GATA chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing
near the quarter pole, angled out six wide into upper stretch, offered no response. LULLABY LAND got bumped at the start by MRS. ASTOR due to
pressure from SACRED IMAGE, chased two then three wide, got out through the latter portion of the turn and went ten to eleven wide into upper stretch and
weakened. COLLABORATION unsettled in the gate prior to the start wanting to cock her head left or right and not face forward until corrected, lunged at the
break, established the front shortly after and showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure through the presence of IN TIME to the outside,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and weakened.

Footnotes
ALETTE D'ORO tugged on the bit when taken in hand early, raced in the two path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, ranged up in the two
path on the far turn, made a bid coming to the quarter-pole, took the lead while asked for her best in upper stretch, shook clear inside the furlong marker and
held under steady urging. STARLIGHT DANCER went three wide on the first turn, dropped back early on the backstretch, settled on the outside, was
roused two then three wide on the far turn, pursued the winner in the stretch, gained on that foe late and willingly earned the place. PINSTRIPEPIZZO
brushed with a rival at the start, dropped back between foes early then moved in, saved ground near the back, moved out on the far turn, reached the four
path outside the quarter-pole, was roused into the stretch and showed late energy but was belatedly on the scene while clear for the show.
SUPERSTARSUSAN lost her footing at the start but broke with the field, went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked outside the
quarter-pole, lost the lead to the winner in upper stretch, moved out while dropping back outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened. WINE AT MIDNIGHT hit
the outside of the gate at the start, went three to four wide on the turns, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. ADULT
ENTERTAINER brushed with a foe at the start, angled in early, went two to three wide on the turns and failed to respond. PRACTICAL ROYALTY brushed
with a rival at the start then was hustled, angled in early, raced near the inside on the first turn, settled off the pace, saved ground under urging on the far
turn and had nothing left.
