Footnotes
SISSUE broke sharp toward the outside, cleared the field before a furlong, continued to hold a daylight advantage while getting a bit of a breather into the
turn, maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling. SHOOTIN RUN in the second flight behind the winner out of the chute, chased that one in the
two path, called on for run turning for home, could do little with the aforementioned victress, all out to preserve the place. COWGIRLSLIKEBLING one paced
behind the top two off the inside for three furlongs, roused for the drive, getting to the runner up late from the outside, not a serious threat to the winner.
SHE'S A PLAYER rank at the break to be away slowly, moved up to mid pack while off the inside, came the outside for the drive, lacked a serious closing
response. IMA HOT TOTTIE in mid pack while along the inside, saved ground to no avail. BILLIE BABY lacked speed while racing toward the inside, failed
to menace. FLASHY GAIL fell back to trail after the start and was never a threat.

Footnotes
PURE CONNECTION allowed the leader to go early, continued to race in the second flight inside through the first turn and down the stretch the first time,
went after the leader midway up the backstretch, took over, quickly clear in the far turn, not threatened to the wire to win ridden out. FREYAS CATZ devoid
of early foot, continued back the opening five furlongs, lodged a rally to annex the runner up position, no match for the winner, far clear of the others.
YOUNEEDTOCALMDOWN in the second flight while outside the winner for a five eighths, attempted to go with that one to the front midway up the
backstretch, lacked a furlong response to finish. BROOKE'S ALL IN broke on top, sprinted clear into the first turn, continued to hold a sizable advantage
past the wire the first time, offered little resistance to the winner when that one came calling with five sixteenths remaining, stopped when headed.

position three wide late in the final turn, challenged outside the dueling leaders through the lane, outgamed at the wire. BROWN RESERVE moved up to
join the winner past the wire the first time, dueled, led backstretch, vied between foes through the stretch, outkicked at the wire while remaining between the
top two at the wire while also being floated out a bit by the winner. SEARCHIN SAFARI was finished before a half, trailed home to not be involved.

TAKING ENERGY broke on top, continued to race forwardly while off the inside, moved to challenge from between horses midway up the backstretch,
dueled into the lane closest to the inside, drew clear under steady handling. RIGHT CIDER stumbled just after the start, moved up while saving ground first
turn, moved out, staged a mild rally to capture the runner up spot, not a serious threat to the winner. NIGHT VISION within striking distance off the inside,
moved to challenged three wide and outside the winner just before a half, dueled with that rival through the final turn then faltered in the drive to lose the
place. GOSPEL FOREST sprinted clear soon after the start, continued to show the way through the first turn, vied backstretch, headed by the winner just
before a quarter remained, vied then fell back and went evenly while continuing along the inside, little left in the late going. SON OF PREACHERMAN void
of early foot, carried very wide into the first turn, remained back in failing to rally. WOKE INDIAN lacked speed, got out into the first turn, fell back onto the
backstretch, continued to fade and jogged in while well back at the wire.

Footnotes
HOLDEN THE LUTE broke well, with the pace three wide, continued to vie between horses through the second turn, dueled into the final bend, disposed of
that rival to be clear into the lane then was all out to narrowly withstand a late surge from the runner up. PATRIOTIC DUTY light bump break, behind the first
flight through the first turn, in traffic into the stretch for the first time, closer before a half, roused into the lane, late surge on the outside to narrowly miss.
CATHOLIC GUILT set or forced the pace along the inside, dueled with the winner inside that one into the far turn, proved no match in the drive nor was he
able to contain the runner up, remained well clear of the others. UNITED PATRIOT four wide through the first turn when within striking distance, continued
to race outside and went evenly thereafter. ROYALLY bumped lightly with the runner up at the start, raced behind the early pace with that one while off the
inside, continued in even fashion off the inside in lacking a closing response. GUINESSEY vied early, was finished before a half, fell further and further
back, jogged in after losing contact with the field through the stretch.

CATALE WINEMIXER away in good order, worked way clear before a quarter, rated kindly the middle half mile along the inside, maintained a daylight
advance through the lane while being kept steadily to task. MUCHO MIA lacked early foot off the inside, moved closer after a half, overhauled the winner's
closest pursuer with a quarter to run, could do little with the victress in the lane, clearly second best. JUST ROSIE void of any early foot to trail for over a
half, staged a mild, belated rally to be along for the show, not a threat to the top pair. GOSPEL CHARITY prompted the winner for five furlongs was headed
for that position and began to gradually weaken. MISS LONG LEGS moved a bit closer after a half, began to give way soon after. SEATTLE WILDCAT off a
step slow, moved up to race in the second flight, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
LOW EURO CAT broke with the leaders, set all the pace inside, remained clear through the lane under steady handling. SHAWK'S LIL MIA broke on top,
relinquished the advantage to the winner, chased that on in the second flight, made little to no headway on that one the final quarter, held sway for the
place. GOSPEL SISTER forwardly placed in the second flight while outside the top two, lost some ground to that pair with a three wide trip through the first
turn, continued in a forward position while under the crop second bend, went flat through the lane to lose the place. HANGXIETY in the second group,
continued back the middle half mild, improved slightly with some modest late interest while not posing a serious threat. WITSEC lacked speed, failed to
muster a rally. GRACE THE LADY fell back to trail after the start, four wide through the first turn, improved a bit while remaining outside in the second bend,
failed to sustain that mild advance through the lane.

SEXY BROWN broke sharp, dueled up front in the two path, continued to alternate up front in the run up the backstretch, edged away late in the second
turn then held that advantage through the stretch under firm handling. SINNIN N GRINNIN settled in mid pack after breaking just behind the two early
leaders, asked a bit to move closer before a half, tipped out three wide while still under encouragement through the final bend, slowly getting to the winner
late while holding the place. LA MORENA broke back, lacked speed for a half, managed a moderate rally up the rail to garner the show. STORMY
BISONETTE broke well, dueled inside the winner, fell back off that one far turn to be the first to blink, continued to gradually weaken through the lane to lose
a couple of positions. STOLEN KISSES fell back to trail after the start,. continued well back, improved position with some late interest while left with too
much to do. BRING IT ON BABY broke out, brushed settled in the second flight after some early encouragement, moved out a bit first turn, tracked the
leaders up the backstretch in the three path, roused four wide and outside the runner up turning for home, came up empty for the stretch drive. REALITY
CHECK broke out, void of speed off the inside, improved position a bit the final quarter without posing a serious threat. MAMASHAVNAHOTFLASH in as bit
tight at the start, lacked speed while racing off the inside, called on for run in the second turn, failed to muster a significant response. PAULA M raced in mid
pack for a half and was finished. RAINBOW ANGEL in the second flight while racing outside, stopped after five furlongs.

Footnotes
SUGAR COATED close up from the start off the inside, lodged an early bid three wide backstretch, dueled with the runner up into and through the final turn
and throughout the stretch, fully extended to prove best in a determined effort. O S U BUDKE pressed the issue from along the inside past the wire the first
time, in some traffic and shuffled back a bit into the first turn, moved out, rebid between foes, dueled inside the winner and proved stubborn to the end. MS.
BUZZINGA settled in the second group early, continued one paced, lacked a response to try the top two in the drive, well clear of the others. HONEY PAT
went one paced throughout while racing off the inside, asked far turn, managed little in the way of a response and finished up evenly. LITTLE MO BROWN
broke on top, narrowly set a pressured early pace, weakened when headed by the top two up the backstretch. GOSPEL VALENTINE balked at loading,
broke a step slow, was never a threat. ROMINA C in mid pack early along the inside, began a steady fade after three furlongs. NEED ALITTLE MAGIC
trailed throughout in showing little.
