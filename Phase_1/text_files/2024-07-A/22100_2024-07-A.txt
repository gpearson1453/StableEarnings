AND FIFTY bumped after the start, set the pace with a clear lead, swung wide entering the stretch, was tiring in the drive and held well. HONOR MY
SPEED was never far back, raced outside, bid willingly to loom a threat, didn't have enough late and held for place. SMOKY TOPAZ was never far off the
pace, bid off the rail leaving the turn to get within range, hung late and settled for show. TAKEN BACK was unhurried early, offered a mild bid only and failed
to threaten. APPLEWOOD bumped after the start, was rated early and raced inside, offered a mild bid and improved position. SILVER N LAI held a good
position along the inside, tired into the second turn and faded from contention. I'M D'CAT was slow early, lacked a stretch response and was outrun.

THREE GOLD PIECES moved up inside to vie for the lead, inched away in the upper stretch and held well while kept to task. GRACIOUS KAT was
crowded at the gap, stalked the pace, closed steadily and was gaining late. YAKETY YAK was away alertly, vied two across to the upper stretch and was
unable to sustain his bid. SAUCY ARGUMENT broke slowly, was void of early speed, bid along the rail on the turn and had nothing left for the drive. PAC
THE PULPIT raced outside, showed speed to the turn, tired and gave way. IN A BIND dropped inside to save ground to the turn, angled out, lacked a
response and was not urged late.

Footnotes
CHIEF KIMOSABI broke slowly, was void of early speed, raced outside, rallied into the turn, circled the field and drew off under mild urging. ADMIRAL
AFLEET was never far off the pace, raced along the inside, awaited room on the turn, angled out, bid willingly and was no match for the winner. DYNAMIC
SUN was slow early, saved ground, slipped through along the rail on the turn and got up for show. IDE LIKE HAWAII raced outside, swung wide leaving the
turn, bid, hung and was outfinished for third. TUCKER THE GRUMP vied two across to the second turn, tired, swung wide and gave way. MARVINS'
POSSE stalked the pace, bid four wide on the second turn to loom a threat, had nothing left for the drive and dropped back. TALK OF THE TOWN raced
mid pack in an even effort and was outrun. MOON TRIP was not a factor. WHISKEY AND EASY was hustled along to vie inside to the second turn, tired,
stopped and was eased.

Footnotes
NOT ON HERB cane out at the start, was in tight and exchanged bumps on the backstretch, angled out on the turn, was carried out into the stretch, bore
out in the drive, got up late and drew clear. INDIA INK set the pace, swung out leaving the turn, led to deep stretch and was outclosed to finish second best.
UNIFIED REPORT bumped at the start, pressed the pace, swung wide entering the stretch and lacked the needed late response. SILVER WINGS was in
tight and exchanged bumps on the backstretch, put in a steady effort and failed to menace. LAGOON bumped at the start, was carried out entering the
stretch and lacked a rally. STOVALL was not a factor. MIKE J broke slowly and was steadied at the start, dropped inside to save ground, trailed the field,
was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
GRAN CHICO vied four across, assumed command on the turn, drew clear in the drive and was kept to task. HIT THE BULLSEYE pressed the pace while
racing outside, challenged for the lead on the turn, fell back and finished second best. TAUREAN vied between horses to the turn, dropped back, went
evenly late and held safely for show. INCHHIGHATAHUNDRED broke out, advanced to the turn to get within range and lacked a late response. STYLING
HOOK was void of early speed, put in a steady effort and improved position. COMPLETE PROCESS hesitated at the start to be off slowly, saved ground
and had brief speed only. COZY GEM was crowded at the start, flashed speed, went widest in the drive and failed to threaten. MY LITTLE VISION broke
out, vied inside to the turn and gave way. ROMANCING MS JUDY was fractious in the gate, hesitated at the start to be off slowly and was outrun. REACH
FOR THE ACES broke through the gate, vied between horses early and stopped.
