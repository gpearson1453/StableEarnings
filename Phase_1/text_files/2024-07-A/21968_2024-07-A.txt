Footnotes
SECRET LIFE hard sent near the rail to take early command, lost ground to Fia first near the seven sixteenths pole, came on again gamely from the inside
of rival and proved best under strong handling. LIL JERSEY GIRL dropped back near the back of the pack early, moved up three wide near the quarter pole
and finished well to rally for the place position racing from the outside. FIA FIRST pressed the early leader, took command nearing the far turn and
weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. HER LUCKY LOTTO chased the early pace from the inside and weakened through the drive. CHOCOLATTI raced
off the early pace, was three deep near the quarter pole, raced six wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. SHORT SHIP stalked the pace, raced
four wide around the far turn and tired. YELOMA raced five to six wide around the far turn, raced from the far outside in the stretch and never menaced.

Footnotes
LA CREMA settled off the early pace along the inside, advanced through the far turn, shifted four wide into the upper stretch and finished well to get up
under strong handling. VAI GATTINA was off a step slow, unhurried early on to race off the early pace, swung wide into the lane and finished gamely to the
wire. GANBATTE set all the pace, had a narrow lead inside the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. DARK DUTCHESS tracked the early leader two deep
from the outside and weakened through the drive. SIPPIN' TIME stalked the pace, hard ridden three deep near the three eighth pole and weakened.
PRETTY COAST stalked the pace near the rail and faded through the drive. SKULL LEGEND was off step slow, raced near the back of the pack early,
saved ground and never threatened. CHELLS GIRL broke awkwardly, raced with the second flight, was four deep near the three sixteenths pole and never
menaced. JUMP A FOX lost ground to race far back and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
BAR DOWN EXPRESS prompt the early leader from the outside and prevailed late under all out pressure. GATTO BE PROUD settled early to race mid
pack, was two deep near the quarter pole, angled out through the drive and finished gamely to the wire to just miss. ASPIRING COMEDIAN was unhurried
early, had an inside move around the far turn into the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. LOOK SHARP set all the pace, had a narrow lead near the
eighth pole and faltered the final sixteenth. YAHOO OMAR tracked the top pair from the outside, raced six wide into the upper stretch and faded.
TAPORICAL was off slowly, lag early on, swung wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. LET IT RIDENESS lost ground to race far back and failed
to menace.

Footnotes
BELTANE chased the early pace, moved up three wide around the far turn, raced five wide into the upper stretch and finished gamely to the wire to prove
best under strong handling. WHITE SERIES prompt the early leader two deep from the outside and kept on gamely to the wire. BEN'S HERO dropped back
early, raced two deep near the quarter pole, angled out to race from the far outside and closed in belatedly. FRATELLINO under a hard chase early, split
two deep near the eighth pole and finished willingly to the wire. TOUCHED UP was off slowly, moved up six wide into the upper stretch, shifted in and
finished willingly to the wire. TO MY TASTE hustled along, raced along the inside into the upper stretch, shifted out four wide and was even with no final
winning bid. HONOR THE CROSS was under a hard chase from the outside, raced three deep near the quarter pole and weakened a bit through the drive.
POPS HARPER hustled early, raced four to five wide around the far turn and had not enough. OFFICE CORRUPTION showed good early foot to set the
early pace near the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. OUR ETHAN CHARLES dropped back early, saved ground and lacked a bid. PER
RULING FROM THE HORSE RACING INTEGRITY AND SAFETY AUTHORITY, POPS HARPER HAS BEEN DQ'D DUE TO A CROP VIOLATION.

off slowly, raced off the early going after the poor start, made rail bid near the five sixteenths pole and kept on gamely to the wire. DON'T TELL KELLY was
off slowly, moved up four to five wide around the far turn and made a good rally from the outside. SPIN THE BREEZE was off early pace, raced along the
inside around the far turn, angled out and was even with no closing bid. OBSTREPEROUS showed good early speed to set the pace while racing off the
inside and gave way. STYLE TO FOLLOW chased the early pace, raced three wide between near the quarter pole and was empty.

Footnotes
CARENTAN bumped at the start, settled along the inside just off the top pair, waited behind dueling leaders nearing the quarter pole, angled off the inside in
upper stretch, kicked clear through the final sixteenth. UNCLE WINCHESTER vied into the turn, dueled outside rival around the bend, fought on to the wire,
no match to winner late. GRAND PARK VIEW steady urging soon after the bell, dueled inside rival around the bend, still in range leaving the furlong marker,
gave way to the wire. JAKNAVA broke sharp, rated back off the the early speed, bid three wide nearing the quarter pole, unable to switch leads through the
stretch, flattened out. GALLANT CREEK slow start, pressed along in the two path around the bend, weakened through the stretch. MAXIMUM COLOR slow
away from the gate, under pressure trailing the field around the turn, retreated from the quarter pole.
