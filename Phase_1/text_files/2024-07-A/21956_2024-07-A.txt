beginning of the race then coming down the stretch had a mild interest. FIELD OF VISION stalked off pace in the two path then coming down the stretch
had no late bid and was given a ride in the equine ambulance. NOW NOW MAN ran with no menace on the back stretch then took the turn in the four path
and was outrun down the stretch.

Footnotes
CADILLAC COWBOY prompted the early pace but fell back on the turn and made a rebid from four wide in the stretch to drive past the leaders and cleared
late. DARIO raced off the pace from off the rail then moved up on the turn from three wide and was gaining on the leader in the stretch but was outfinished
by outside closer. COACH SAM P broke well to set the early pace then pressed the pace from the inside on the turn and gave way grudgingly in late stretch.
STREAKIN DEACON pressed the pace in the early stages then took the lead after the half mile marker but was empty in the stretch drive and tired.
BOSTON BLITZ was allowed to settle down the backstretch, made a mile bid on the turn and kept on to gain late on the top three. PAINTED SUNDAY
raced near the back and failed to menace. WILLIE'S POSSE was last away and raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground to no avail. SOCIAL
APPEAL trailed the field early then was distanced, pulled up around the three sixteenths pole and given a ride in the equine ambulance.

CAROLINA JACY left the gate got clear of their rivals and drifted out to the three path where she continued on into the turn while being rated through the
turn angled into the rail for the trip to the wire and drew off again to prove best. WHEELS LIKE NALA stalked the pace from the rail, then made a mild bid on
the turn but could not catch CAROLINA JACY, eventually angled out to three wide at the three sixteenths but was no match for the winner. INEZ settled in
the four path while racing near the back and passed tired foes coming down the stretch. QUEENS RIOT ran in the two path with the early bid at the half pole
and then was caught by foes and flattened out the three sixteenths and faded in late stretch. DON'T BLINK TWICE ran on the rail but unfortunately was

PERFECT STAR stalked the pace down the backstretch then moved out to three wide going into the final turn and took command at the quarter pole and
won going away. RUN ROCKET was allowed to settled from the inside through the final turn then moved out to two wide for a late run and was second best.
SENATOR CON prompted the pace down the backstretch then took a brief lead going into the final turn and was challenged by PERFECT STAR on the
outside but couldn't fend and weakened. RUSSIAN TANK raced off the pace down the backstretch then moved out to three wide on the final turn but failed
to menace. ASPEN CLUB rushed up to a clear early lead around the first turn held the lead to the three furlong marker but was overtaken going into the final
turn and gave way. HELAIRE was allowed to settle near the back and was never a threat. MONARCH'S MISCHIEF was unhurried and showed little.

MEAN AMERICAN bumped with SHE'S GON D'WILD leaving the gate, kept on to prompt the pace from three wide down the backstretch then took a narrow
lead around the final turn, when challenged at the top of the stretch she dug in and drew off. SHE'S GONE D'WILD bumped with MEAN AMERICAN leaving
the starting gate then raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn while bumping with EMMAS RULER, settled off the pace on the backstretch and
made a bid from three or four wide at the three furlong marker and took a brief lead in upper stretch but was outkicked by the winner. EMMAS RULER
bumped with SHE'S GON D'WILD on the first turn while racing in the middle of the pack then moved between horses near the three furlong marker and
tipped out to four wide in upper stretch and was gaining late for the place. STAR'S DREAM stalked the pace from the inside to the final turn and lacked the
late response needed. ANN'S STORM was unhurried early then moved up slightly on the backstretch, angled out to three wide on the final turn but never
made a serious bid. AVERI EVER AFTER was allowed to settle while saving ground down the backstretch but was never a factor. LOVERS NEVER SAY
went to a pressured lead but was through after a half.

SALOMEINTHEHOOP sprinted away from the gate to a pressured lead to the three furlong marker the edged away but floated out going into the stretch but
kept on and drew clear. TOOTOO TOURIST was unsettled in the gate prior to the start then tracked the leaders from two wide to midway down the
backstretch then moved up going into the final turn, tipped in to save ground and slipped through in early stretch for the late bid to be second best. RUSTY'S
SUNRISE was restless in the gate prior to the start then settled in the middle of the pack from off the rail then moved up from three wide at the three furlong
marker, tipping out to four wide at the eighth pole to make a late rally. SISTER SAINT was allowed to settle near the back down the backstretch then moved
up from three wide on the final turn and made a mid track rally in the stretch. RIPTIDE ROSE roused to the front to vie for the lead from three wide to the
final turn then fell back slightly and was outfinished in the drive. TROUBLE WITH SUGAR was hustled along early to press the pace from two wide to the
final turn then fell back slightly and was out kicked late. MARK WITH AN E stalked the pace from the inside to the final turn and retreated. MISS IMELDA
