Footnotes
MOBAY PRINCESS laid in range between foes from the three path turning into the backstretch, ranged up four wide approaching the quarter, made a
sweeping bid from the four path turning into the lane, drifted to the rail while taking command passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. FAR ABOVE raced off
the pace in the three path, came under a ride while angling out passing the quarter, swung from the five path into the stretch, and ran on for place. RAGTAP
GIRL was unhurried in the four path early, received a right handed cue passing the quarter pole, got in tight between foes turning into the lane, but kept on
for show. ELYANNA showed the way from the two path turning into the backstretch, was pushed along while off the rail entering the far turn, but lost the
lead at the top of the stretch, and flattened to miss minor placings. GOULDIAN bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated in the two path, was coaxed from
the rail midway around the far turn, but got stymied along the inside from the top of the stretch to the eighth pole, and failed to bid. SOME OF IT stalked in
the five path, was roused to bid three wide midway around the far turn, but faded in the stretch. BIANKA HEART tracked in the two path, was cued from the
rail entering the far turn, but weakened in the stretch. ETHEL bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the four path, floated out to the seven path
under urging turning into the stretch, but did not factor. ROSE VIEW raced wellback in the five path down the backstretch and never threatened. LAURIE
BLUE laid up close in the four path but gaveway between foes turning into the stretch.

clear. REMERTON saved ground off the pace, rallied inside and gained the place late. NOBLE TIGER raced in range four wide, bid in the four path around
the far turn, led leaving the five-sixteenths pole, vied outside of the winner to midstretch and weakened a bit late. LINE ASTRAY chased the pace two and
three wide and lacked the needed rally. BLUE SPEARMAN set the pace in the two path, yielded leaving the five-sixteenths, drifted out in upper stretch and
faded. NO PLEBEIAN failed to menace while racing three and four wide. DIXIE PREACH pressed the pace three wide and faltered nearing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
MUFRIH rated in the two path, was nudged along the rail around the far turn, bid inside of foes from the two path turning into the lane, and inched ahead of
an outer foe in the final furlong. SPETTRO showed the way in the three path around the first turn before settling to allow an outer foe to takeover entering
the backside, retook command in the two path going into the far turn, dug in while tipping out to the four path turning into the stretch, but was edged out by
an inner foe in the final furlong to place. TIZ A BEAST had his head turned at the start, moved up around the first turn to press the pace in five path down
the backstretch, led passing the half, lost the lead under a ride in the three path entering the far turn, floated out to the six path turning into the lane, and
kept on for show. CAPTAIN ANTHONY raced off the pace in the five path, was driven in the six path midway around the far turn, fanned out to the eight
path at the top of the lane, but made no impact. EUPHORIA STAR trailed in the two path, swung out to the eight path at the top of the lane, but did not
factor. SHAKE YOUR BONES tracked in the four path, was ridden between foes from the five path into the far turn, but flattened from the seven path in the
stretch. ROWDY JESS stalked in the three path but faded around the far turn. FLATTER ME chased in the three path but failed to menace from the five
path in the stretch.

Footnotes
SALS DREAM GIRL was unhurried in the three path early, coaxed while five wide early around the far turn, bid while swinging out to the six path at the top
of the lane, and drew clear on her left lead. CLOUD STORAGE raced wellback in the four path, received a right handed cue in the five path midway around
the far turn, and ran on for place. BEACH READY tracked in the two path, waited along the rail rounding the far turn, had to steady passing the quarter,
tipped out to the four path passing the eighth pole, and kept on for show. PACIFIC PRINCESS rated in the four path, was ridden between foes in the three
path around the far turn, and finished evenly from the four path in the stretch. WORLDLY BEAUTY raced off the pace in the five path, ranged up to bid four
wide midway around the far turn, briefly lead in the four path turning into the lane, but lost the lead before the eighth pole, and flattened. GAYLES EVENING
set the pace in the two path, was coaxed along the inside rounding the far turn, but faded in the stretch. WICKLOW GAL laid up close in the three path, was
driven between foes in the two path around the far turn, but had to steady passing the quarter, and yielded.

Footnotes
ORNELA (CHI) trailed inside, tipped three wide in upper stretch, surged between foes and was up on the wire. BAHAMIAN MOON stalked the pace from the
rail, took the lead leaving the eighth pole and led until the final stride. DAVID'S ROSE set the pace along the rail, drifted out in upper stretch, yielded leaving
the eighth pole but kept trying to the wire. MISTICA TRAVIESA (CHI) tracked the pace two wide, angled five wide in upper stretch and had a mild gain.
VAL'S GAL raced off the pace two wide, swung seven wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. ANATOMY raced off the pace three wide, swung eight
wide in upper stretch and was not a threat. TATOR MADE pressed the pace two wide, was floated four wide in upper stretch and was outfinished. PAWKY
chased the pace three wide, angled six wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally.

Footnotes
DOC AMSTER prompted the pace in the three path, bid midway around the turn, floated out to the six path at the top of the lane, took the lead, and drew
clear. URANIUM raced off the pace in the four path, was coaxed along in the five path around the turn, floated out to the eight path entering the stretch, and
chased on for place. ALL ABOUT LUCKY set the pace inside, was roused when challenged passing the three-eighths pole, lost the lead at the top of the
lane, faded in the final furlong, but held show. DOUBLE PLAY KING chased in the five path but was one paced. HOLIDAY FANTASY trailed in the three
path and made no impact from the five path down the lane. JOE DI BAGGIO stalked in the four path, was driven into the turn, but flattened in the stretch.
SONG RUNNER tracked inside but weakened in the stretch. RARE JEWEL raced wellback in the two path and never menaced.

MUSICAL ROMANCE (GB) saved ground off the pace, swung six wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and was up in the final strides. E M'S
TREASUREGIRL trailed inside, tipped two wide near the quarter pole, rallied between foes, took the lead near the sixteenth pole but was outkicked late.
LUCKY GIRL COCO set the pace inside, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth pole and held third. MY ROYAL VOW raced in range three
and four wide and was one-paced through the lane. HOUSE OF MELODY saved ground in range and lacked a closing bid. LADY AZTECA failed to menace
while racing two and three wide. I'M BLUSHING settled off the early pace two wide, bid three wide between foes around the far turn then was blocked for
most of the stretch run. BELLESHAZZA prompted the pace two wide and weakened through the lane.
