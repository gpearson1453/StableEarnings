NEW EVERY MORNING sprint clear early then saved ground setting the pace and increased his advantage. RHODIUM RUNNER was forwardly placed
while racing three-wide and finished well for second in a steady effort. DENNARD was reserved off the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch and
finished in a mild rally. ABRAAJ MIRAGE was close-up early racing along the inside then was allowed to drop back and settle, came two-wide into the
stretch but lacked a rally. ARTHUR SPOONER chased NEW EVERY MORNING to the stretch and weakened. SMOOTH PAPA reared up at the start to get
away behind his field then was unhurried and failed to be a factor.

Footnotes
SPORTY NUGGET saved ground chasing the early pace, came two-wide into the stretch and was up in the final sixteenth to win going away. DEVIL D'
ORO vied for the lead from along the inside, was unable to resist the winner late but continued on gamely for the place. MONEY IS TIME saved ground
while being reserved off the pace, slipped through during the drive and finished in a mild rally. POCKET KNIFE was forwardly placed early while racing
two-wide, angled out to be four-wide entering the stretch but lacked a rally. JUST PIN ME settled in the middle of the field, came three-wide into the stretch
and was gaining slightly late. MY MOTORHOME saved ground while being allowed to settle and failed to seriously threaten. BULLETPROOF TOO vied for
the lead to the stretch from along the outside and tired. BABY MARTINI was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and was not a factor.
GORMLEY GAL prompted the pace for six furlongs while four-wide and tired. ALWAYS GALLANT dropped back early and trailed.
