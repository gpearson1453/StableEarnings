COLLABORATIVE forced the early pace, had a slim lead on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch veered in and was kept to task.
FIFTH SEASON was unhurried early and a factor on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. CARPE
BELLUM set a pressured pace and dueled on the far turn but was in tight at the top of the stretch and outfinished. SANTIAGO SALSA was off the pace and
had a mild gain on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no threat. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON CARPE BELLUM

RED MAPLE set the pace, had the lead on the turn and with mild pressure in mid stretch prevailed. STORMY SOUL stalked the leader from the outside and
was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch just missed. ANARCHY tracked from the inside and had a good position on the turn
but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more. EXCEED was off the pace and hustled along on the turn but was not a factor.

Footnotes
FOLLOW ME HOME showed speed from the outside, had a slim lead on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the
win. TONKA WAKAN was in touch, dueled on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best in a good effort. JOEYBONES
was well back and closed the gap on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. PERSEVERE forced the early pace but
chased on the far turn and was empty. YOU SEE ME hopped at the start, lost ground on the far turn, eased to the wire and walked off. A CLAIM OF FOUL
BY THE RIDER ON TONKA WAKAN AGAINST FOLLOW ME HOME FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

moved up on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. MOMENT OF ZEN was off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn but
from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off. BUSTA GROOVE was unhurried early and roused on the turn but from the seven path at the top of
the stretch failed to fire. FAJARDO was off slow, showed little and had no impact. SPIRIT OF SEATTLE was away alertly and raced evenly on the turn but
dropped back through the stretch. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON M C JACKHAMMER AGAINST NAMEOFTHEGAME FOR ALLEGED
