path on the turn and finished second best. ONE WITHEVERYTHING Broke slow, four wide into the turn, five wide out of it while never a threat. MOR
VALOR Vied for the lead three across while getting out, continued to get out and tired. WONKER WARRIOR Vied lead from between early and tired. THE
LAST SHEEK Showed little.
