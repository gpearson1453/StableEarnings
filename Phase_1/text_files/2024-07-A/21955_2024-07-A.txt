Footnotes
KELL'S BELLS vied for the lead early before gaining command at the half, was in a steady hand ride while being pursued by foe on the turn, set down in the
early stretch and drew off to prevail while in a strong drive. PERLIANO was allowed to settle along the rail while pursing the pace close behind the leaders,
then came four wide leaving the bend, rallied to get up for the place position in the late stretch but did not have enough to catch the cleared leader.
JOHNNY APPLESEED was reserved at the tail of the field early, then rallied a mild bid in the late stretch, could never catch the leader and was up for the
show winnings. LOUISIANA FLASH pressed the pace between rivals, then rallied bid on the turn while two wide and lacked the needed response in the late
stretch. MASTER OF DISGUISE before pressing the emerging leader while urging eagerly throughout the turn then lacked rallying in the stretch. ONE LAST
THING pressed the pace while four deep and in a hard drive, was used up on the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
TAKE ACTION moved up from the inside with an outer counter part to vie briefly with the early pacesetter, took over at the half, was in a steady hand rive
throughout the turn, respond well in the early stretch to pull away down the lane and prove much the best. CAJUN WARRIOR laid off the pace while four
wide, was well rated on the turn before being asked in the early stretch then battled with inner foes for the place position and was up at the wire besting the
field. HERO TIME tucked along the rail to save ground early, was urging steadily on the turn, rallied bid in the upper stretch to battle for the place position
down the lane and just missed. DOC'S BOLERO was away alertly to lead the way briefly before being overtaken by inner foes, continued to stalk the
leading duo from the three path on the turn, rallied a mild bid in the early stretch then gave way. VALDINA DREAMS moved up from the two path to contend
for the lead at the half, pressed the emerging inner foe on the turn, lacked the needed response and gave way in the lane. TAKE FLIGHT was no menace.
BELFAST BOY was out run and never threatened.

SOLDIERS SACRIFICE pursued the pace while two wide, came under coaxing leaving the bend while three wide, dug in gamely in the late stretch to edge
past WILL TAKE CASH and was up in the final strides to prevail. WILL TAKE CASH was brushed at the start by inner foe, then dueled with said rival into
the turn, gained command in the upper stretch, was in an all out drive, then was out finished by an outer foe and was second best. DUTCH BUS broke
outwardly and slowly, then trailed in the early furlongs, circled five wide leaving the bend, rallied bid and was able to get up for the show winnings besting
the rest of the field. BOLD EXCAPER broke outwardly and brushed foe, then dueled from the inside into the turn, was in a long drive heading in the stretch,
then gave way in the final yards. SUPREME CAPO laid off the pace while four wide into the turn, then rallied a mild bid in the late stretch and came up
empty. CATCHEM IF YOU CAN was allowed to settle while two wide towards the back and raced at a moderate pace and never threatened. SECRET
TAVERN chased the pace while three wide into the turn, rallied a mild bid in the stretch and lacked responding. NEVER OVER ME vied for the lead briefly
from the inside, then settled back and raced along mid pack and never rallied. STRIKE RIDGE was no rally.

WITHOUT A TRACE was away well to establish the pace from the inside into the turn, then held sway down the lane to prevail in hand. MENA chased the
pace from the inside, moved up to second position on the turn, rallied bid leaving the bend was no match for the determined leader and held the place prize.
GENERAL SHIPMAN was allowed to settle at the back while two wide, then moved up while three wide on the turn to gain third position in the upper stretch,
could never catch the leader and maintain the show prize. PROJECTION chased the pace while two wide, then dropped back at the half, rebid on the turn
while drifting out three to four wide, bumped foe then kept on down the lane just missing the show position. BATTLE STRIKE was allowed to settle along the
inside and needed rally. SEND THE BOSS stalked the pace while three wide, was urging steadily on the turn and lacked rallying in the stretch and flattened
out. TEJAS chased the pace while three wide briefly before retreating back to the trailing pack, bid leaving the bend, was carried out and bumped by an
inner foe and failed to rally in the stretch.

Footnotes
IN FORM chased the pace while two wide, edge past outer foe to gain second position on the turn while in a steady hand ride, dug in gamely in the early
stretch, took over the lead in the final sixteenth and held on well to prevail. LEAR was allowed to settle back in the three path towards the rear, then came
out five wide leaving the bend to rally bid, shifted inward and was gaining ground while passing foes and was up for the place winnings. TWENTY ONE
SKIDOO was forced outwardly, then settle between rivals at the back of the pack, then split rivals on the turn to rally a mild bid in the stretch and was able to
close well for the show prize. TURQUOISE BLUE hustled to the front to establish the pace down the backstretch from the inside, cleared the turn, was
overpowered in the late stretch and faltered. ZED led briefly from the start, then chased the pace while four wide, drifted out five to six wide leaving the bend
to bid in the stretch and kept on while in mild drive to no avail. STRUCTURED chased the pace from the inside at an even pace throughout and needed
more. ROCKY TOP MISCHIEF chased the pace from the three path briefly, then faded on the turn and was no rally. REBEL RYDER veered outwardly and
was no factor.

SPEIGHTSVILLE pursued the pace from the inside, was roused leaving the bend while two wide, was in an all drive to edge past STRAIGHT LUCK in the
late stretch and be up in the final strides to claim victory. STRAIGHT LUCK broke outwardly and brushed foe, then went shoulder to shoulder with an inner
foe before gaining command heading into the turn, maintained the lead in the late stretch while in a long drive then was out finished by an outer foe and was
second best. HELLO HELLO MISTER was brushed at the start, was unhurried early, then swung five wide leaving the bend, rallied bid, besting the rest of
the pack and was up for the show place. ALTO ROAD was urging eagerly while pursing the leading pair into the turn in the two path, rallied gamely on the
turn and into the stretch and needed more in the end. HARD CANDY laid off the pace while four wide mid pack, was in steady hand ride on the turn while
two wide then rallied a mild bid in the stretch and came up empty. TEAM LEADER chased the pace while two wide early, lost some ground heading into the
turn from the inside, then bid in the upper stretch and lacked the needed response. BRAHMS BOY moved up to duel from the inside briefly, could not retain
stride and continued to stalk the leader on the turn before flattening out in the stretch. CHIEF BRADY was no threat. MALIBU THUNDER was no menace.

RIGHT TONE saved ground in the early stages while two wide mid flight, was roused on the far turn, came out three wide and dug in gamely while angling
inwards in the late stretch and tipped by the pace setter to be up in time to prevail. LEA ME BE showed the way from the inside to set the pace down the
backstretch, was in a long drive leaving the far bend, continued to dig in grudgingly in the late stretch and almost lasted to the wire but was out finished by

Footnotes
GOD KNOWS WHY tracked the pace from the inside while being nicely rated, came out three wide leaving the bend to tip by the dueling pair in the upper
stretch and drew off to prove much the best. ALONG CAME THUNDER was unhurried early, fanned five wide leaving the bend and closed well for the place
prize besting the rest of the field. DOC'S JOY raced mid pack while three wide, was urging from the inside on the turn then rallied in the late stretch, could
never catch the leader and was up for the show winnings. LOVE ME DO was allowed to settle towards the rear while two wide, remained in a steady hand
ride on the turn, rallied a mild bid in the upper stretch and came up empty. SLICKLICKOFALIVING was coaxed early to duel from the inside into the turn,
was in a long drive heading in the late stretch then was passed up by an outer foe and gave way in the remaining yards. LADY KATILLAC never threatened.
DOC'S BUD led briefly before sparring with inner rival into the turn and on the final quarter, was in a hard drive then was out finished by GOD KNOWS WHY
from the outside and gave way. TERE'SDRAMAQUEEN was no factor. PERSONAL ISSUES was no factor. SUGAR FOR DEBBIE bid for the lead while
three wide before letting up to track the pace from the two path into the turn then failed to rally in the remaining furlongs.

Footnotes
PHUNK broke outwardly and bumped foe, vied briefly before establishing the pace from the inside into the turn then lasted to the wire while in a determined
drive. AZUNIA prompted the pace between foes, then stalked the leader from the two path on the turn, got up to second position in the upper stretch, lacked
the winning bid to overpower the leader and maintain the place prize. THE NEXT BIG BLING bid for the lead while two wide, then stalked the pace from the
inside and in a steady drive, then rallied in the late stretch and needed more and was able to get up for third place. HAPPY SAILOR stumbled at the start,
then pressed the pace while two wide into the turn and in a steady hand ride, then rallied a mild bid in the late stretch, could not assume command and gave
way. PROUD VALENTINE raced towards the back while three wide, then came out five wide leaving the bend to rally a mild bid in the late stretch but it was
not enough. TOOTIE never threatened. BRINGONTHEBUBBLY was bumped by inner foe and was no menace. OLGA'S GOLD DANCER was bumped and
no rally. TURN ON THE BLING was bumped and no factor. CRANKY SHEILA chased the pace briefly while four wide, then bid briefly on the turn then
flattened out in the stretch.
