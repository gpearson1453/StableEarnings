Footnotes
RONIC set a pressured pace around the first turn and up the backstretch, edged ahead and held a length lead late on the far turn, saved ground entering
the lane, came under firm handling and held on in final strides. RABBIT HOUND was forwardly placed through early stages, raced in striking distance three
wide at the quarter pole, hustled along three wide into the lane, was inching up on the leader approaching the wire and just missed. DRIFTER pressed the
early pace, launched a two wide bid late on the far turn, sustained a two wide bid through the lane and cleared the rest. VALIANT WEST raced off the top
trio and saved ground, weakened around the far turn and continued to tire in the drive. LAST DIAMOND raced in the back, came three wide into upper
stretch and had no response. ROCKSTAR RED rated off the pace up the backstretch then weakened around the far turn and into the lane.

HERESHECOMESAGAIN set the early pace, widened advantage at the furlong marker then held late under pressure. GLAD VON D raced in range, hustled
along three wide into the stretch, angled inside and finisihed with good response. LU'S TIME raced near midpack, was ridden along three to four wide
through the lane and edged closer to the wire. GOLDEN BONITA chased in contention, saved ground around the turn then gave way. DARK BEAUTY raced
up close in opening stages, continued in close range around the turn then weakened in the lane. MIMOSA FOR LUNCH raced off the pace, came two wide
into upper stretch and never threatened. PROMISED OATH was ridden along off the early pace, swung four wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten.
LUCKIE GOLDIE raced off the pace and saved ground to no avail. CUZ WE LOVE BRODY raced in the back throughout. This race had a timing
discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
WHITE SANDS sped to the lead at the start and widened advantage still racing in hand late on the turn, saved ground entering the lane, shook the reins a
couple times upper stretch, responded willingly and drew off in hand. MAVERAMA hustled along three wide in pursuit of the early leader, sustained a bid in
the two path in the final furlong, was no match for pulling away winner but dug in gamely for second best. JET SWEEP JOE stumbled at the start and trailed
in the back, saved ground around the turn, picked up the pace turning for home, shifted to the three path in the final furlong and got up late for show. MO
LUTE raced in range sitting just off the second flight in opening stages, hustled along the inside around the turn, tipped three wide at the head of the lane,
ran on and got edged late for show. MISSION FIRST was forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, was no match for pulling away leader in upper
stretch, ran on near the inside and weakened late. COMPLEX MUSIC raced in contention chasing two to three wide around the turn, came three to four
wide into the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
JUST BASKING was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced two wide into the first turn, was nicely rated sitting in the back although never too far from
the frontend, picked up the pace four wide late on the turn, given cue turning for home, took over the lead upper stretch, widened to a clear advantage a
furlong out and finished going away. JUST BE QUIET raced three wide into the first turn and stalked the top pair up the backstretch, edged up and raced in
aim for the lead near the quarter pole, sustained a two wide bid through the stretch run and cleared second best. DEVILETTA led the way around the first
turn then set a pressured pace up the backstretch, held a slim lead over close running pursuers late on the far turn, got collared by the winner past upper
stretch and weakened to show. SHIMMERING ALLURE secured the inside position around the first turn and tracked the pace up the backstretch, continued
in range while ridden along the rail late on the final turn, cut the corner then angled out three wide and failed to kick on. IN JUST MY HEELS was forwardly
placed two wide around the first turn, applied pace pressure to DEVILETTA up the backstretch, could not keep pace approaching the quarter pole and
steadily weakened. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
HENRO secured inside position around the first turn and was nicely rated sitting in range, remained along the inside and waited patiently around the final
turn, angled to the three path at the head of the lane, came under right handed pressure, responded, roused forward to challenge JUST A TOUCH for the
late lead, poked a ahead in front, dug in gamely and prevailed. JUST A TOUCH was forwardly placed around the first turn then pressed the pace up the
backstretch, moved up to engage rival for the lead near the quarter pole, took a slight edge a furlong out, continued on top then challenged by HENRO deep
stretch, dueled heads apart, fought on gamely from the inside and just missed. NORTHERN FLAME set a pressured pace around the first turn and up the
backstretch, continued with a slight edge then took on the challenge of JUST A TOUCH late on the far turn, fought back gamely to the furlong marker, got
collared for the lead and weakened to show. DIMATIC was unhurried and raced off the early pace, saved ground and edged closer late on the far turn,
tipped a path wider for the drive, kept on with interest but needed more for serious impact. MUGATU settled off the early pace and saved ground, came
under a ride, angled out near the quarter pole, came five paths wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. CASCADE CRUISER raced four wide
entering the first turn then quickly advanced to be forwardly placed entering the backstretch, stalked in striking distance to the far turn, hustled along three
wide, came four paths wide into upper stretch then gave way. NEXT LEVEL raced off the early pace, hustled along three wide into upper stretch and failed
to threaten. ZATARA settled around the first turn, raced near midpack going through the backstretch, failed to move on when called upon around the far turn
and steadily weakened. OKIE CLIPPER was forwardly placed around the first turn then weakened and raced just off midpack, failed to kick on when called
upon around the final turn and gave way. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most
accurate time.

Footnotes
RED ROUTE ONE was allowed to settle and raced two wide around the first turn, picked up the tempo late on the backstretch, circled up four wide into
contention late on the far turn, sustained a steady three to four wide bid into the lane, kicked in gamely at the sixteenth pole, surged to the wire and
prevailed. UNLOAD set a pressured pace around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to hold a slight edge around the far turn, came two wide
into upper stretch, battled on gamely, held clear a furlong out then got edged in final strides. VELOCITOR tracked the pace racing inside of a rival in the
second flight, had to wait patiently for a clear path late on the far turn, saved ground entering upper stretch, came under left handed urging, drifted out and
bumped AINT LIFE GRAND at the eighth pole, drifted out and bumped rival again shortly after and kept on. AIN'T LIFE GRAND raced near midpack two
wide around the first turn, continued to rate near mid-range up the backstretch, responded willingly when called upon entering the far turn, ranged up into
strong contention near the quarter pole, sustained a bid in the two path in upper stretch, took a solid bump by VELOCITOR near the eighth pole, got
bumped again near the final sixteenth pole, lost momentum and evened out. GUNTOWN was allowed to settle and save ground through early stages, cut
the corner entering the lane, hustled along near the inside, gained position but lacked the needed response for serious impact. HEROIC MOVE raced in
range sitting outside of a rival in the second flight, was ridden along three paths wide late on the far turn, hustled along three to four wide into upper stretch
and flattened out. HIT SHOW settled through early stages, hustled along two wide around the far turn and failed to kick on. MINE THAT STAR raced off the
pace, saved ground then came three to four wide into the lane and never threatened. ESCAPOLOGIST lacked speed and raced in the back, swung five
wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. SPEED BIAS quickly advanced into close contention running around the first turn, pressed the pace up the
backstretch, continued up close past the mid-way point on the final turn then came up empty near the quarter pole. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN
INQUIRY AND TEH RIDER OF AIN'T LIFE GRAND CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST VELOCITOR FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN, AFTER
REVIEW VELOCITOR WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FOURTH FOR DRIFTING OUT AND CAUSING INTERFERENCE TO AIN'T

Footnotes
THE HOOF vied for the early lead, shook free leaving the three eighths pole, kept clear around the turn, widened advantage mid-stretch then remained
confidently handled and held safe. HAPPY STRIKE tracked the early pace, hustled along two to three wide around the turn, sustained bid through the lane,
edged closer in final strides and finisihed clearly second best. AIR FORCE HUMOR raced near midpack, was ridden along three to four wide into upper
stretch and kept on for a share. GOLD MEMBER vied with the eventual winner for the early lead, could not match strides past the three furlong marker,
remained in contention around the turn then gave way. RIDING DOUBLE raced off the pace, came four wide into the lane and had no response.
LITTLEJACKRABBIT showed response in the opening quarter then steadily retreated. DUBYA VEE failed to move into contention and dropped back in the
lane.
