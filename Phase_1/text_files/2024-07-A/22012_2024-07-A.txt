but was no match for the winner and finished up clearly second best. EL CORRECAMINOS raced in closest pursuit, was unable to keep pace with the
leaders and faded. SIZZLIN ROSE rated well off the pace early and was outrun. DESTIN TO BE GREAT never reached contention.

Footnotes
HE'S A SAINT rated off the pace in the three path, shifted out to the five path at the head of the lane, closed steadily under the riders encouragement and
narrowly prevailed in a multi-horse scramble to the wire. LAHUN saved ground inside, waited for running room near the quarter pole, shifted out to the two
path at the head of the stretch, closed gamely and was narrowly denied. J J'S CAPER broke alertly to set the pace, was confronted by SIX SHOTS OF T in
the final turn, refused to give up the front and was collared in the final strides. BREAKING THE BANK trailed the field early, bumped rail then steadied into
the opening turn, and bid belatedly. ONE SKY tracked four wide in the backstretch, roused at the quarter pole, and yielded in the stretch. SIX SHOTS OF T
pressured the pace leaving the backstretch, dueled in the final turn, and had nothing left in reserve late. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the
rider of BREAKING THE BANK against the rider of HE'S A SAINT alleging interference into the opening turn and midway through the turn was not allowed.
After review the Stewards determined there was insufficient evidence to warrant a disqualification.

SUNBIZ was allowed to settle just off the pace while five wide, moved up alongside STARMA nearing the quarter pole, drifted out of the turn, dueled into the
stretch and edged clear late. STARMA showed the way through the backstretch in the four path, responded to a challenge from SUNBIZ into the lane,
dueled into the stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. GOOD BYE NEW YORK chased three wide early, raced wide in the final turn, improved position
through the stretch to earn show. CHICTIME raced wide into the final turn, and passed tiring rival late. DIAMOND DI was under a snug hold in traffic
entering the opening turn, lodged a mild bid along the rail and gave way. GOODSTRIKER offered little. BAKED N WIRED stalked inside, chased and
retreated into the stretch.

EXAMINER hurried outside, fanned four wide into the opening turn, was set down for a drive nearing the three-sixteenth marker, and uncoiled a late surge
to get by with time to spare. LANNY MAC sat in striking distance while four wide, swung out five wide at the quarter pole, gained a short advantage at the
head of the stretch and was bested late. WYE CROSS trailed the field early, shifted down to the rail nearing the stretch then launched a bid to earn a third
place finish. MAJESTIC STREET contested the early pace from the two path, dueled inside of DON'T STOP DREAMIN, inherited a slim lead then gave way
in the final sixteenth. DON'T STOP DREAMIN vied for the early lead, dueled through the final turn, and gave way midstretch. PERDITION flashed early

BON PRIX vied outside for the early lead, continued to duel outside of WEDGE POND into the stretch, and edged away under handling. WEDGE POND
contested the early pace inside of BON PRIX, battled inside then gave way grudgingly late stretch. A MAN'S MAN shifted out to the five path leaving the
backstretch, dropped back in the final turn, and closed belatedly to score show. BEHIND THE CURTAIN stalked the dueling pacesetters, rallied under
urging into the stretch and was rundown. SPORTSCARR trailed early, and offered a late mild bid. DANCING WILLIE lodged a bid into the stretch and faded.
IT WORKED last away and failed to menace.

Footnotes
TENNESSEE MOSES away alertly, was allowed to settle off the early pacesetters, went in pursuit of the leader into the far turn, swept the lead and drew
clear. DONTBRINGMEDOWN contested the early pace then drew clear leaving the backstretch, was overtaken nearing the quarter pole, and finished
clearly second best. WHEN U KNOW U KNOW bumped leaving the gate, then hustled leaving then chute, swung out four to five wide at the head of the
lane, and closed gradually getting by late to score show. MOON MULLINS raced wide leaving the chute, settled midtrack through the backstretch, chased
through the stretch and was collared late. PADDY'S SPEEDSTER rated off the pace, lodged a mild from the rail into the lane, and faded. LEGAL
ASSASSIN broke into WHEN U KNOW U KNO when leaving the gate, circled into the final turn, and failed to threaten. E PAY ALL THE WAY broke in then
was hustled leaving the chute, and chased to no avail. TRUE ALYBYE vied leaving the chute, chased inside, and was done early. MORE THAN A FLASH
lacked early foot, and trailed throughout.
