Footnotes
DREAMINONTHENILE applied pace pressure to HANKS GIRL up the backstretch, was ridden along two wide but could not reach the leader late on the
turn, remained determined in pursuit, dug in gamely mid-stretch, re-gained on the leader late and got up on the wire. HANKS GIRL set a pressured pace up
the backstretch, turned back the bid from DREAMINONTHENILE late on the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, widened to a clear advantage, began to
tire in final stages and got nailed by DREAMINONTHENILE in final stride. ELLLL E broke in at the start, raced in the back, picked up the pace late on the
turn, hustled along three to four wide down the lane and cleared a share. KASA was forwardly placed racing just off the top pair in the opening quarter,
flattened and lost ground on the top pair mid-way around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, angled out two wide, hustled along but had no response.
HOP AWAY HOTTIE rated off the top trio three wide up the backstretch, was ridden two wide around the turn, failed to kick on, ran on evenly and never
threatened.

LORRAINE'S LEGACY was allowed to settle off the pace, ranged up four wide into contention late on the far turn, sustained a bid three wide through the
lane, dug in gamely in final stages and nipped rival on the wire. ADRIA sped to the lead at the start and set the uncontested pace, held clear around the final
turn, came two to three wide into upper stretch, continued with the advantage in the final furlong then got nipped on the wire. DO YOU BILEVE was
forwardly placed around the first turn and tracked the pace up the backstretch, saved ground entering upper stretch, edged closer along the inside then
evened out in final stages. GOLD STRATEGY was reserved and raced in the back through early stages, edged closer late on the far turn, hustled along four
wide down the lane and improved position. SWEET LAURA raced off the pace, saved ground and had no response when called upon. SET THE PACE was
forwardly placed around the first turn, continued to chase after the leader up the backstretch, came up empty late on the final turn and continued to tire in
the drive.

Footnotes
NECKER ISLAND was nicely rated sitting just off the top trio while saving ground, continued unleashed on the rail around the turn, given cue entering the
top of the lane, responded gamely steadily closed along the inside, gained the advantage approaching the final sixteenth and held firm. JAXON TRAVELER
was forwardly placed and raced just off the early pacesetter, edged a bit closer near the quarter pole, hustled along three wide into upper stretch, sustained
a steady bid but lacked the needed kick to prevail. CONFIDENCE GAME was allowed to settle through early stages, came under a ride two wide at the
head of the lane, shifted a path wider, continued to edge closer under firm handling, finished with good response and just missed place. COUNT DE
MONET sped to the lead soon after the start and set the pace up the backstretch, continued to hold firm along the inside around the turn, hustled along two
wide into upper stretch, battled on for the lead then got collared approaching the final sixteenth and weakened. PEACE DOG stalked three wide up the
backstretch, launched a three wide bid leaving the turn, sustained a four wide bid into the final furlong but lacked the needed kick for serious impact.
BOURBON HEIST raced in the back, came three to four wide into upper stretch and had no response.

UNSUNG MELODY tracked the pace along the inside up the backstretch, continued unleashed inside around the turn, given cue turning for home, slipped
through along the rail at the head of the lane, took control over the lead, widened advantage and kept to task. HAPPY AM I rated two to three wide just off
the top trio in the opening quarter, loomed closer three wide late on the turn, hustled along four then three wide into upper stretch, sustained response
through the lane and finished second best. FAITH ALONE was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced in the back in the opening quarter, launched a two
wide bid late on the turn, shifted out to race five paths wide at the top of the lane, sustained a steady bid and gained a share. DEALING JUSTICE rated off
the early pace, saved ground around the turn, tipped out four wide for the drive and had a mild improve. PALACEIN sped to the lead at the start, set the
pace near the inside up the backstretch, continued on top around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, got collared for the lead and gave way. OLGA
ISABEL was forwardly placed up the backstretch, raced in striking distance at the quarter pole, went to go three paths wide into upper stretch, got in tight

Footnotes
MAGICAL LUTE was allowed to settle out of the gate and secured inside position around the first turn, continued unhurried in the back although never too
far off the frontend, continued to save ground still unleashed around the final turn, cut the corner then tipped two wide at the top of the lane, challenged
WEST COAST FASHION approaching the sixteenth pole, vied briefly then kicked clear. WEST COAST FASHION sped to the lead soon after the start and
led the way around the first turn, raced on top under pressure through the backstretch, turned back bid from BAYTOWN LOVELY late on the far turn, came
two wide into upper stretch, widened to a clear advantage a furlong out then got overtaken late. FLAT OUT STORMIN raced in range along the inside,
waited for a clear path around the final turn, tipped two to three wide at the head of the lane and ran on for a share. LACIE BE GOOD stalked two wide
between rivals up the backstretch, flattened out mid-way around the far turn and failed to threaten in the lane. TAKE ME SERIOUS raced four wide heading
into the first turn, rated in range up the backstretch, loomed a threat near the quarter pole then failed to sustain bid leaving the far turn and gave way.
BAYTOWN LOVELY raced up close around the first turn and up the backstretch, raced in aim at the quarter pole then steadily retreated in the drive. This
race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

DIAMOND CITY was forwardly placed from the onset, moved up to challenge DESPERATE MAN for the lead at the quarter pole, vied to the furlong marker,
then shook free and pulled away. SHOULDABOUGHTDABAR settled early along the inside, hustled along two wide late on the turn, got carried three wide
into upper stretch, sustained bid down the lane gained place. DESPERATE MAN set the early pace, took on the challenge of DIAMOND CITY at the quarter
pole, vied to the furlong marker then failed to be a match and weakened to show. GUIDED ARROW raced in range along the inside, rode the rail around the
turn then shifted out two wide entering top stretch forcing SHOULDOFBOUGHTHEBAR into BURN JAKEY BURN who bumped twice with WESTERN
TOURIST, then flattened out. UXMAL raced off the early pace, was ridden along the rail around the turn, continued near the inside through the lane and
failed to rally. BURN JAKEY BURN raced in the last flight, came under firm handling mid-way around the turn, was carried out a path and forced into
WESTERN TOURIST at the head of the lane, bumped twice with rival then gave way. WESTERN TOURIST tracked the top pair through early stages,
chased three to four wide around the turn, bumped twice with BURN JAKEY BURN when rival was forced out at the head of the lane then faded. THE
STEWARDS POSTED INQUIRY AND THE RIDER OF BURN JAKEY BURN CLAIMED FOUL FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE LANE, AFTER

Footnotes
SAY IT NICELY sped to the lead at the start and set the early pace, held firm still unleashed around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, shook the
reins upper stretch, responded willingly, drew off while ridden out then finished in hand. SNAP'N TAP raced near midpack, swung five wide into upper
stretch and gained second best. AMERICAN POSSE raced in range, chased inside around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive and stayed on to clear
show. MILTON STREET got bumped between at the start, raced in the back, saved ground on the turn, hustled along near the inside through the lane and
improved position. TAKE ME UP BRADY got bumped at the start, moved up in close contention three to four wide late on the turn then flattened out in the
final furlong. LUCKY LOUIE raced off the early pace, hustled along four wide into upper stretch and lacked a rally. BILLY BOB ROCKET broke out and
bumped solidly into rival, raced off the speed and failed to move into contention. LAWLESS JOHN broke in and bumped with rival at the start then was
forwardly placed through early stages, continued bid around the turn then tired in the drive. FRANKLY EPIC took a solid bump at the start, quickly recovered
and raced in close contention then came up empty around the turn.
