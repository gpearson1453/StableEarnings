HEEZESPEEDY was hustled early, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. GENERAL COMMAND
was in touch and roused from between foes on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. STREET SERENADE
was off the pace, saved ground on the turn and was up for show. SENSING HOLIDAY was in range and had a good position on the turn but from the seven
path at the top of the stretch leveled off. JUSTIN'S WAY stalked the early leader and was a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch
weakened. SUPER HEADLINE was well back and showed nothing in a dull effort.

had a mild gain on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. P T BEAUCETTE stalked the early leader and was roused from the
inside on the turn but had no response. RING IT UP was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and was never a threat. MISS SINGH ANGEL was away
alertly but lost ground on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was empty.

Footnotes
MOUNTAIN SOUND settled off the pace, moved up on the turn, angled outside through the stretch and drew clear. CANT BEAT THE KATZ showed speed
from the inside, was a factor on the turn and had the lead from the six path in mid stretch but failed to hold. J M R GEMMA was in touch, raced evenly on
the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for show. BIG GINGER was away alertly and had a slim lead on the turn but from the four
path at the top of the stretch gave way. FOREST B was hustled early and dueled on the turn but had nothing left. SHEBATOWN was in mid pack and saved
ground on the turn but had no late kick. SILVER CANDICE was in range and roused on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no
response. LOADED VIXEN was off the pace and showed little in a dull effort.

Footnotes
CREATIVPERFORMANCE set the pace, had the lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. ASHWICKEN
was in touch and had a good position on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch just missed. FIXYURHAIRUPRETTY was unhurried early,
had a mild gain on the turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch rallied late. FEW REGRETS stalked the early leader and was a factor on the turn
but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. PICK A PENNY was in range and hustled along on the turn but from the four path at the top of
the stretch had no kick. SILENT WARNING was off slow and showed nothing in a dull effort.
