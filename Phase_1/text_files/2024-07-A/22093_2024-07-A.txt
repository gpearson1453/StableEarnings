TURNING PAGES prompted the early pace three wide, drew on even terms for the lead before the turn, matched strides until deep stretch and drew clear
late under strong handling. IT'SGOODTOBESEEN battled for the lead two wide and finished second best. OVERLOAD trailed into the stretch and closed a
gap late along the rail. TADZIO contested the lead along the rail into the turn then weakened. MATTHEW'S PATRIOT was no threat, stopped abruptly,
jogged to the wire and was walked off.
