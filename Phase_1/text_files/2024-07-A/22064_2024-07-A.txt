wide, bid into the stretch but was outfinished. NATURE'S CANDY raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, bid on the final turn then weakened.
FULLMOONMAGIC saved ground under rating then flattened out in the stretch. PAYOUT RATIO (IRE) quickly sprinted clear, was collared midway on the
turn and faltered. FAST GAL chased close up inside for five furlongs and faded. NATURE TRAIL raced off the leaders between foes and stopped. NEON
CITY dropped back early and was never in contention. MOSEY lacked speed and was always outrun. MY LITTLE RED unseated her rider and ran off prior

BATTALIA controlled the pace, widened in the stretch and was never threatened under moderate pressure. NURSE CARALYN bumped about at the break,
advanced inside with some energy while no threat to the winner. ONTHISHARVESTMOON raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and faded in the
stretch. WINE GODDESS bumped about early, saved ground and was never a factor. UNBRIDLED SASS chased wide and gave way readily.
INCOMPARABLE lacked speed and was never a factor. SWEETEST MOMENT lagged far behind losing contact with her field. UNIVERSAL DESIGN was a
late scratch at the gate on the advice of the track veterinarian.

inside on the turn then went evenly in the stretch. BRUNO BARBER GIRL forced the pace early then weakened while easily third best. LIL' LATE LUCK
lacked speed, angled inside and was never a factor. STEAL THE DEAL broke slowly, moved up between rivals then gave way readily. DOROTHY'S THE
BOSS chased wide and began fading on the turn. ONLY GIRL dropped back early and trailed throughout.

UNCLE WATER FLOW settled inside, moved closer before half a mile, angled wide in the stretch and surged clear. RUNYONESQUE set a clear pace to
midstretch then weakened slightly in the final eighth. PREDOMINATE dropped far behind then offered some late energy along the inside. CHIP'S FRIEND
fractious in the gate prior to the start, forced the pace and faltered. FOREVER WICKED saved ground off the leaders and lacked a rally. DOCTOR DOOM
moved close up three wide for half a mile and gave way. RUNNIN JOKE rated behind the pacesetters then stopped in the stretch. IMAGINE THIS trailed
early and was always outrun.

PARADISE VALLEY pursued the pacesetter outside, continued determinedly and wore down that rival in the final yards. TALKIN PHAROAH hustled to the
front, repelled foe on the turn, was collared again late and battled gamely to the finish. DYLAN'S RUBY faded briefly inside on the turn then narrowed the
gap in the stretch. CAPITAL CONQUEST chased off the leaders in the two path and proved empty in the stretch. KEEPING IT COUNTRY lacked speed
racing wide and failed to rally. RESPIRATOR dropped back early and was never a factor. MR. ROUNDTREE lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

TALK TO THE JUDGE vied along the inside, repelled a rival in midstretch and edged off in the stretch. EARLY EDITION underwent shoe repair in paddock,
trailed early then finished with good late energy. DISCO EBO pressed the winner, challenged that rival on the turn then weakened in the stretch. MAJESTIC
CREED lacked speed inside then continued well while no threat. MISS NEW YORK raced off the leaders outside, was put to urging on the turn but faded.
FOGGY NIGHT broke slowest and was never involved. ROYAL POPPY settled outside the dueling leaders and stopped abruptly.

ELEVATED GAME took control inside then remained clear throughout under steady handling. NANTASKET BEACH settled off the pace inside, swung wide
into the stretch and rallied. CAPO pursued the winner to the final furlong and weakened slightly. CARD TRICK far back early, angled wide on the final turn
and was very wide into the lane. RETWEET moved close up three wide, offered a brief bid on the final turn then faded. MORE THAN WORK chased in
midpack and lacked a rally. SEVEN BRIDGES ROAD lacked speed and was never in contention. T REX dropped far behind trailing his field then caught
fading rival. JARLIAN raced just off the pace inside to the stretch and stopped.
