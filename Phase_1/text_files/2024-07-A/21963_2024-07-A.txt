K C OUTWORK chased the pace for three and one half furlongs, made the lead, dug in determinedly under right handed urging when joined by the runner
up to his outside and proved best in a game effort. RAMBLER stalked the pace three wide, loomed boldly outside the winner at the top of the stretch then
couldn't get past. MOR CRAFTY settled in the three path down the backstretch, dropped inside on the turn, loomed boldly at the quarter pole then failed to
sustain that bid. CRACK COMMAND sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace to the quarter pole then weakened late. CAN'T
CRASHMYPARTY brushed the gate and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RONNIS SECOND WIND away alertly, set all the pace shook clear in upper stretch and prevailed under strong handling. SMOKIN JOE stalked the early
pace, loomed boldly three wide entering the stretch and finished second best. COLONEL COOPER unhurried early, found his best stride late in the five
path. MISTER ZAZU offered a mild bid along the inside midway on the turn then failed to sustain that bid. AIR RAID bore in at the start bumping
GRETCHENS MANE MAN then was no threat. GRETCHENS MANE MAN was bumped and forced inward sharply at the start, prompted the pace two wide
past the quarter pole, was in a bit tight between rivals entering the stretch, steadied and dropped out of it. AQUAVIT had speed through the turn then gave
way. PROFESSOR NICK was tight at the start, shifted outward shied and veered in sharply soon thereafter and unseated his rider. THE STEWARDS
POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF GRETCHENS MANE MAN LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF SMOKIN JOE
FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

AUSTRIAN NAVY allowed to settle, closed rapidly four wide through the turn to make the lead at the top of the stretch then widened the balance of the trip
to win as much the best under a strong hand ride. LA CUMPARSITA never far back, swung wide, closed fast in the middle of the racetrack and got up for
second. BAREBACK FUN stalked the pace three wide, inched closer nearing the quarter pole, steadied as the winner went by on the outside then finished
with good courage. EPICUREAN dueled for the lead two wide past the quarter pole and weakened late. ROSY APPLE was no threat.
CONSTITUTIONALIST was no factor. ROCK ROSE contested the lead along the inside pas the quarter pole then was used up. THE RIDER OF
BAREBACK LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
THE DEVIL'S DREAM chased the pace into the stretch, was carried out to the seven path at the top of the lane, dug in late under right handed urging and
got up by the narrowest of margins. SHAKEURSKINNYLEGS away alertly, set all the pace, drifted to the six path in upper stretch and just failed.
PANAMANIAC allowed to settle, found her best stride late in the middle of the racetrack. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE stalked the pace along the inside and went
evenly. RAINBOW SHIP trailed into the stretch and had a mil d late rally two wide. BOSSY LADY failed to menace.
