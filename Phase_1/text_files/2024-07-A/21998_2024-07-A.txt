the end. TAKING CHARGE DESI stalked the pace in the two path, shifted to the four path in the stretch but was no match for the winner. BEAUTIFUL
TEMPLE hopped at the start, was clear early but couldn't hold off the closers. WILD TAPIT saved ground but couldn't gain late. Z ZS RED stalked the pace
inside, angled four wide at the quarter pole but lacked a late bid. KALL KAT stumbled at the start and raced evenly. LANFRANKOPHILE stalked at the four

Footnotes
MISS CANDELA bore in at the start, led inside, drew off in the stretch and was kept to mild urging. DON'T MISS OUT was bumped at the start, raced inside
and had a mild late bid. OFF PITCH pressed the pace between rivals, raced in the four path in the stretch and gave way. ROYAL JUSTICE was bumped
and squeezed back at the start, raced inside and rallied on the turn. NO SELF CONTROL saved ground, came four wide into the stretch but had no bid. MY
STRONG HEART pressed the pace in the three path but gave way in the stretch. SMALL TOWN ACCENT stalked the early pace in the four path before
giving way. HAZEL MY CANDY hopped at the start, raced well back and passed tired rivals. MOLLY'S LEGACY was through early outside. CHARMING
TALISMAN stalked the early pace between foes before giving way. INNISFREE LASS was not a factor. QUIBBLE was off awkwardly and raced well back.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE, PLUS AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF ROYAL JUSTICE AGAINST THE
TOP TWO FINISHERS, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
