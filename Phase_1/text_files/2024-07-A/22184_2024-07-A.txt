Footnotes
SPYCRAFT stalked three deep, bid and gained an advantage passing the five sixteenths pole, led into the final furlong and held firm from bidders on either
side. FITZPATRICK broke a step slow, tracked along teh inside, awaited racing room nearing the lane, offered a grinding charge up a vacated rail to bid
entering the final sixteenth, but was denied and saved place. W W CRAZY bobbled subtly at the start and dropped back to trail early on, saved ground at
the rear, rejoined the group entering upper stretch, tipped three wide entering the final furlong, rallied between horses with a late kick but came up short.
COMMUNICATION MEMO laid off of the pace four wide, crept closer around the turn to be within striking range nearing the lane, ran on outside of rivals to
attempt a bid in the final furlong but drifted out subtly at the sixteenth pole and needed more late. APPEAL DENIED set a strongly pressured pace inside of
a pair of rivals, got headed by his widest counterpart leaving the five sixteenths pole, shifted off of the rail entering the lane and faded between horses. TIM
TAL pressed two wide and between horses, but weakened turning for home. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using
video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
CAT'S CAVE dictated terms along the inside, remained in hand around the turn before an outer stalker offered a bid at the quarter pole, yet repelled that
challenge and shook clear in upper stretch, then held sway under a light drive. CURL GIRL stalked outside of the pace setter, ranged up to bid at the quarter
pole, but was turned away in upper stretch and held place. MUSTANG LADY tracked three deep, came under urging in pursuit around the far turn, then ran
on evenly. ROSIA BAY tracked along the inside and lacked a bid. COZEE RAGS was off slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BETTERA was off a beat slow, pursued from the inside, tracked inching closer to the leading trio from the two to three path turning for home, tipped four
wide to take aim in upper stretch, progressed to bid in the final furlong, drove past leaving the sixteenth pole and held sway. MCGINNIS broke a step slow,
settled off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the three path before shifting five wide entering the lane, rallied to claim place and take aim on the
new leader late, but was fended off. ROYAL SALUTE stalked the leaders from the two path, bid three deep into the far turn, vied before leading into the
lane, but was caught by an outer bidder passing the sixteenth pole and yielded place late. MO RUM broke outwardly, prompted three deep, vied two wide
approaching the far turn, then between horses around that bend, failed to keep pace with his outer counterpart entering upper stretch and yielded.
HIGGINSVILLE pursued from midpack two wide, chased outside of the leading trio around the far turn, got floated to the six path entering the lane and failed
to menace. ACCONA vied two wide and between horses, then along the inside down the backstretch, sparred with a pair of outer rivals around the far turn
but gave way in upper stretch. SESAME STREEK rushed the gate pre-race without breaking through, vied for the lead with an outer pair of prompters
through a fast opening quarter mile, chased those rivals approaching the nine sixteenths pole, sustained pursuit around the far turn and tired. TORNADO
ROAD was bothered by an inner rival at the start, trailed in the three path and got outrun.

Footnotes
AMERICAN WOMEN tracked along the inside, gained tipping outside of the leader turning for home, bid two wide entering the lane and drove past. LADY
KATHRYN stumbled and brushed an outer rival at the start, showed the way into and around the turn, met an outer challenge entering the lane, got headed
by that one reaching the furlong grounds and was second best. MURPHY GIRL bobbled a bit upon leaving the gate, tracked three wide, got outmoved by an
inner bidder nearing the lane, kept on in pursuit of the top pair into the final furlong and lasted for show, bled. MINTY was slow into stride, raced off of the
pace in the two path, shifted out to the four path into upper stretch, stayed on but missed reaching show. MISS ELLE prompted inside of the leader for a
quarter mile, backed off to stalk outside of that one leaving the five furlong pole, chased around the turn and faded between horses at the five sixteenths
pole. QUEEN MCKINZIE broke a step slow and was brushed by an inner rival at the start, raced at the rear four wide and made little impact. MY SWEET
LOVE raced at the rear in the three path and between horses, and failed to factor. HOME FIRST was slow into stride, saved ground well back and
weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
ELLEN JAY broke a beat slow, recovered to press four wide into the turn, bid outside of the leader and in the four path with five sixteenths to go, vied while
tucking nearing the lane, led in the two path entering it, drove clear while lugging in at the furlong grounds, tired late as an outer rival closed in yet found the
wire in time and narrowly lasted. SUPERCILIOUS BOLT stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the top pair entering upper stretch, claimed place
leaving the furlong grounds, closed in on the tiring leader to offer a bid nearing the wire, but narrowly came up short. WHERE'S THE WINE prompted two
wide and between horses early on, failed to sustain pressure and chased the top pair turning for home, got floated out to the four path entering upper
stretch, yet kept on willingly to reclaim show in the final sixteenth, and held that position from an outer challenger. SHEZTHEFACTOR pursued from
midpack along the inside, tipped to the two path into the turn, swung to the five path entering the lane, yet only offered a mild kick and was denied show late.
BARBTOURAGE showed the way inside of a trio of rivals into the turn, met an outer challenge at the five sixteenths pole, got headed by that one nearing
the lane and gave way. DREAM ON STORMY exchanged bumps with an outer rival at the start, saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. LIFE'S SAGA
(IRE) traded contact with in inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace four wide, got floated to the six path entering the lane and lacked a rally. MIA
MARCELA prompted three wide and between horses into the turn, but faded with five sixteenths to go. FUN LOVING leaned inwardly and was slow away
from the gates, trailed around the turn and never got involved. JUS EVELYN chased in the two to three path and faded turning for home.

GLOBAL SENSATION stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, bid at the quarter pole, forged an advantage in the two path entering the lane
and drove clear. SOLIDIFY broke slowly and trailed in the two path around the turn, launched a rally between horses leaving upper stretch, shifted out to the
four path at the sixteenth pole, sustained progress late and narrowly reached place at the wire. TILTED TOWERS showed the way in the two path, met an
outer challenge at the quarter pole, got headed while cutting the corner entering the lane, proved no match for that one in upper stretch, dug in to resist an
outer challenge for place in the final furlong, fended off that bidder but was nailed at the wire by a wider challenger. SOGNO DI CAMPIONE (CHI) came out
and bumped a rival at the start, tracked along the inside, tipped outside of the top pair entering the lane, ran on to bid for place at the sixteenth pole, but was
kept at bay and got outfinished by an outer rival. OUTLIER saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. TIMELESS BOUNTY laid off of the pace in the
three path, shifted out to the five path entering upper stretch, but lacked a rally. PRINCIP was bumped by an inner rival at the start, tracked outside of the
top pair and from the four path then faded.

SOVEREIGNS JOY set the pace along the inside, vied with a pair of outer bidders around the far turn, sustained the battle with ROCKY JOY through
midstretch, shifted out while dueling approaching the wire and prevailed. ROCKY JOY pressed two wide, vied between horses around the far turn, dueled
with his inner counterpart in upper stretch, drifted out while battling in the final furlong, then missed at the wire. JUNGLE LAW stalked along the inside,
pursued from the two path around the far turn, chased while inching closer to the top pair in the final furlong, aimed between them in the closing stages, but
checked the inner leader shifted course across his path in the closing stages. ADRASTEIA pursued from midpack two wide, chased under urging in the
three path around the far turn, then stayed on late to surpass outer rivals for a minor share. SAN MARTIN leaned out at the start, pursued from midpack
along the inside, saved ground before shifting out to the five path at the furlong grounds, but lacked the needed kick. DELLACROCE rushed the gate
pre-race without breaking open the stall doors, stalked three deep, vied around the far turn, but faded in upper stretch. PROVISIONAL raced at the rear
along the inside and never got involved. VERY SATISFACTORY leaned in and bumped the gate whlie breaking slow, laid off of the pace two wide and got

Footnotes
GLOBAL STAGE tracked along the inside into the turn, progressed to offer a bold challenge outside of the leader at the five sixteenths pole, assumed
command nearing the lane, drove clear in upper stretch and was put to wraps nearing the wire before an abbreviated gallop out. BRAZEN BOY set the pace
early on, built a clear margin into the turn, but met an outer challenge at the five sixteenths pole, proved no match for that one entering the lane, shifted out
in upper stretch and held place. ANDY'S CANDY chased forwardly in the three to two path, shifted out to the five path in midstretch, stayed on late and
edged show. PROTEGE tracked in the four path, bid for place leaving upper stretch, but was turned away and got outfinished for show. REWIRE laid off of
the pace in the three path, swung out to the six path entering the lane, tipped inwardly in the final furlong and moved up. MERLOTTI trailed into the turn,
advanced in the four to five path around the bend before floating to the seven path entering the lane, but flattened out and drifted inwardly in the final
furlong. DEWY'S BEAST pressed outside of the leader, but failed to sustain pressure into the turn, chased cutting the corner turning for home and gave
way. PRINTS MONEY pursued along the inside and faded. BEAUDACIOUS COLTON lacked speed along the inside, then two wide around the turn and
failed to factor. NATIONS DREAM raced at the rear two wide and between horses into the turn, then got outrun.
