Footnotes
WON DAY pressed the pace from two wide to midway on the turn, took command nearing the quarter pole, repelled the runner-up in upper stretch and was
unchallenged to the wire. BECKY'S TATTOO stalked the pace from three wide on the turn, challenged the winner turning for home, was no match for that
one but continued on willingly to be second best. BIND ON EARTH tracked the leaders from the fence in the turn, angled out for the drive with a mild bid
and kept-on to hold the show. RAIN raced mid-pack throughout and showed some late interest in the lane. FASTED trailed most of the way and passed
tiring rivals in the stretch. START WELL failed to menace. A WISH FOR MADELYN was never a threat. TRACK SMART set a pressured pace to midway on
the turn, failed to respond when challenged and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
APRIORITY AVENGER tracked the leaders from four wide on the turn, rallied while angling out six wide turning for home to engage the pacesetter in
mid-stretch and drew off convincingly. MALADJUSTED MISFIT set a pressured pace throughout, dug-in for the drive, was no match for the winner but
finished willingly as second best in a good effort. COUNT ON RAIN unhurried in the early going, made a steady advance around the bend circling seven
wide at the top of the lane and was along for the show. LEISURELY slow early to trail and made a grinding gain up the fence in the lane passing weaker
rivals. SENOR VEGAS pressed the pace from two wide to the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. GONE SOLUTION fractious in the gate, broke inward
when the doors were opened to bump the inside rivals and went evenly without being a threat. TOMMY SIX FINGERS crowded between rivals at the start
when bumped by his outside rival, moved up to be well placed on the turn and flattened out in the stretch.

BEYOND D'ORO raced mid-pack between rivals down the backside, angled six wide to the clear turning for home and closed well to pull away in deep
stretch. TWO JET pressed the pace through the turn, loomed turning for home and finished with a mild kick to gain the place. SHE'SMYSMOKESHOW
reserved off the early pace, circled the field from five wide with an early bid on the bend to challenge turning for home and failed to sustain the rally.
TOLATETOOWAIT raced near the rear of the field to the quarter pole and passed tiring rivals in the lane. HEY MADALYN CLAIRE stalked the leaders from
four wide and failed to respond when called upon nearing the quarter pole. BE A BANDIT was not a factor. SPOONFUL OF SUGAR rushed up the fence to
take the lead shortly from the gate, set a pressured pace to midway down the lane and gave way inside the eighth pole.

REGAL TEMPLE stalked the pace from four wide through the turn, rallied between rivals turning for home, was brushed by the runner-up straightening out
in the lane, lugged-in several strides later to knock the runner-up slightly off-stride in upper stretch and fought on determinedly to prevail in the drive. HOLD
MY HAT tracked the leaders to midway on the turn, rallied splitting rivals from three wide at the quarter pole, brushed the winner turning for home, was
bumped hard in upper stretch by the winner and kept on in the lane to be up for the place. COATTAILS rushed up to take a clear lead down the backside,
responded when engaged turning for home and finished willingly along the fence while outkicked in deep stretch. BEACH TRIPPIN off to a slow start, made
an early bid on the turn from five wide to loom in upper stretch and flattened out late in the lane. BOX OF CANDY reserved off the pace through the turn,
angled eight wide in the lane and showed late interest. MR. BRAD'S COWBOY slow early and passed tiring rivals from nine wide in the stretch.
GREATIZLOVE broke tardy almost to the degree of having dwelt and was never a threat. CLEARLY THE BEST flashed brief speed to be up on the pace
and was through early. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN INVOLVING THE TOP PAIR AND UPON REVIEW MADE NO
CHANGE.

GRABIQ stalked the pace for three-quarters, rallied from four wide midway down the lane and found his best stride late to overtake the pacesetters and be
going away at the wire. ISLAND GOLD set a well rated pace down the backside, responded when engaged on the final turn, dug-in gamely through the lane
to deny the presser but was out-finished by the late charging winner. MOLTO VINO pressed the pace to the quarter pole, challenged the pacesetter turning
for home, battled through the lane and weakened inside the sixteenth pole. CIRCLE UP was one-paced never posing a threat. HOLIDAY DOUBLE hesitated
at the start giving the field several lengths and was never a factor from there.

HOME VISIT set a pressured pace throughout, repellled the presser at the quarter pole only to be immediately challenged by the runner-up, dueled through
the lane determinedly to prevail in a game effort. UNCLE FRANK reserved off the pace the first half while well held in the second flight, rallied five wide on
the far turn to engage the leader turning for home, battled the length of the stretch with the winner and was denied at the wire in a good try. MOTAWAAFEQ
traveled along the rail in the second flight to the far turn, was taken back to trail, angled around the field at the quarter pole and mounted a late gain from
wide down the lane. BAYOU JAM unhurried down the backstretch while racing between rivals, rallied to threaten in upper stretch and was unable to sustain
the bid. DON'T BOX ME IN pressed the pace from three wide to the far turn and faded coming home. MINNESOTA MIRACLE pressed the pace from
between rivals down the backside, took a brief lead on the final bend and weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
MESA SPIRIT reserved off the pace to the turn, rallied up the fence saving ground on the bend, angled four wide to the clear turning for home and closed
well to prevail late in the drive. CAJUN BLAST stalked the pace from three wide to midway on the turn,rallied to the lead in upper stretch, dueled with the
winner down the lane and was outkicked in the final strides. GHENT set a pressured pace for three-eighths, responded when challenged at the top of the
lane and weakened late in the lane. MONEYSTRIKE tracked the leaders to upper stretch and showed mild late interest. SCAT FREE pressed the pace from
the fence to the turn and flattened out finishing one-paced. SHAWN'S SOLVING was not a threat. GONE ELVIS was not a factor.

Footnotes
EARLY DAWN pressed the pace from three wide into the turn, took command on the bend, cleared in upper stretch and held the closers safe in the lane.
REAUX BINA unhurried in the early going to trail, rallied through the lane from four wide splitting rivals and was gaining in deep stretch. CLASSICAL
MAGNOLIA reserved off the pace to the turn, rallied from five wide turning for home to loom in upper stretch and failed to gain position down the stretch.
DESPEIGHTFUL tracked the leaders saving ground, cut the corner turning for home to be prominent and failed to sustain the rally lacking a closing punch.
ALL AMERICAN PAT hustled up to prompt the early pace and faded coming home. SPECIAL NOTE sped to the early lead dueling to midway on the turn
and tired in upper stretch.
