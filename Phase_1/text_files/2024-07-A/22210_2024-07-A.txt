THE KID PATAKY was clear early, dueled late and was kept to task. FOREVER HOME stalked the pace inside, bid at the sixteenth pole, dueled late and
was outfinished. FAR AND FEW chased the pace in the three path, bid at the quarter pole while in the four path and couldn't close late. TIZZY JOJO stalked
the pace in the three path, shifted to the rail in early stretch and had no bid. DOCS SEVEN stalked the early pace in the two path before fading. GOLD DEL
MAR stalked the early pace between foes before giving way. LAST LEGACY was through early.
