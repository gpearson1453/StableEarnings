Footnotes
LET'S EAT raced with a slim early lead inside, was met nearing the three quarter pole and rated close from that point, recovered the advantage approaching
the three eighths pole, drew clear past the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn near the rail and was steadily handled in the lane. ICETECA raced well back
from early contention in the four and five paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the seven path on the far turn and came along for second later
yards. RAMSEY settled in the three and four paths, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and
flattened in the lane. RUN ROCKY RUN settled off the pace in the three path, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, steadily improved at the rail on the
far turn but flattened stride in the lane. SHARP STYLE stalked the early pace two deep then took the nod into the second turn, dueled leaving the seven
sixteenths pole but was caught toward the three eighths, gave chase from that point but flattened in the three path on the far turn. BLOOD BROTHER
stalked the early pace three wide and raced at near even terms leaving the three quarter pole, gave chase into the second turn but faded approaching the
five sixteenths pole. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

HARDLY EVER BETTER contested at near even terms from the start, raced at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, took the nod passing the
eighth pole and dug in determinedly to hold off TWO BRONZE STARS, who set a pressured pace with a slim lead, contested the edge off the rail on the
turn, was met passing the eighth pole and reluctantly ceded in the duel through the stretch. POWERED BY LOVE chased through the backstretch, rounded
the turn about the three path and dug in to take third the final yards. BERTRAM FLIGHT gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the
lane. FURREAL chased, raced in the five path on the turn and flattened in the lane. MAKIN' GOLD gave chase and saved ground on the turn. SARAH'S
CANDY CAMP broke through prior the start, came away awkwardly and immediately settled into a lope.

DIRECT THE CAT pulled herself to the front at the thirteen sixteenths pole and moved to the inside to set a well reserved pace, was given some rein
approaching the quarter pole, drew off through the far turn and was mostly hand urged in the lane. NO DENYING DENIS settled in the three path the first
turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and dueled through the stretch for second. IHEARTRAINACOMN
saved ground off the pace, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second.
SOMEBODY LOVES ME dropped well back from contention while saving ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and could only improve her position
in the six path on the far turn. AIM'S JUBILEE rounded the first turn about the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path
on the far turn and showed little in the lane. MUSIC LASS stalked the early pace from the three path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in
the four path on the far turn and showed little in the lane. QUEEN NEFERTARI stalked the early pace off the rail, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole
but weakened approaching the far turn.
