MANCHESTER broke sharply clearing the field drawing off into upper stretch holding firm under a mild drive. TAPINTOYOURBEER chased four deep on
the turn drifting eight wide in upper stretch angling in while rallying late getting up for place. WHOOP GONE gave hard pursuit to upper stretch proving no
match there hanging late. BRAZILIAN SEA hustled along the rail was in a touch close mid turn weakening into upper stretch. WILD WINE steadied briefly in
traffic mid turn. HARTEL veered out slightly at the break trailing after. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF BRAZILIAN SEA AGAINST THE RIDER OF
WHOOP GONE FOR INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.
