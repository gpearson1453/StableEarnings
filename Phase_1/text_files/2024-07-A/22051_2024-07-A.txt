ACHILLES HEEL stalked close up three wide, bid three wide on the far turn, put a head in front turning for home, then dug in gamely outside of COCO
SHELL, battled heads apart with that rival in a spirited stretch duel and got the nod at the wire. COCO SHELL vied two wide for the lead, dueled into the far
turn, gained a short lead, then dug in gamely inside of ACHILLES HEEL in midstretch, battled back, dueled heads apart to the wire and just missed.
MOUNT TRAVERS bobbled at the break, tracked on the inside, bid between rivals entering the far turn, angled out into the stretch and lacked a late
response. CANADIAN PHAROAH raced three wide early, then trailed the field on the inside, was asked on the far turn and closed belatedly on the rail.
DURKIN'S CALL raced off the pace inside, was asked on the far turn and had no rally. NEW YORK PANTHER vied inside for the lead, dueled on the
backside, chased on the far turn and faded. FIGHT FIERCELY raced two wide off the pace and dropped back on the far turn.
