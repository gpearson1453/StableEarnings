Footnotes
MORAL AGENCY stalked the pace from the rail, angled into the three path in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and was up late. ALPHA
BLUE set the pace in the two path, kicked clear turning for home and led until deep stretch. JADES JAY prompted the pace in the three path, could not keep
pace in upper stretch but kept on to hold the show. BULLET BLUES was bumped at the start, bumped hard entering the turn, raced five wide around the
bend and rallied belatedly outside. GOWOKEGOBROKE chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally while lugging in through the lane. SEVEN
ANNIVERSARY chased the pace two wide and lacked a rally. DYNAMIC EMPIRE was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two wide and never
threatened. JAKE'S AFFECTION was bumped entering the turn, raced four wide and was never in contention. VINICIO played no factor while racing three
wide. INSOLENT was bumped on both sides and pinched back entering the turn, angled in soon after and was never a threat. CUCUY was outrun inside.

Footnotes
WIN N YOUR IN laid up close outside of the leader in the three path, bid under rousing midway around the turn, took the lead while floating out to the six
path at the top of the lane, and kicked clear in the final furlong. BEE A QUEEN chased in the four path, was ridden into the turn, angled out to the seven
path at the top of the stretch, and chased on for place. NEODERA set the pace in the two path, came under a ride when challenged midway around the turn,
but lost the lead turning into the lane, and faded to show. MISS MARY NELL was prompted while in range from the two path early, but lost ground rounding
the turn, and was one paced in the stretch. WHODOYOULIKEHERE rated in the three path early but never factored. U BET JO'S PRAYING raced off the
pace in the five path but never threatened. MIND SHIFT GAME raced wellback in the three path and never menaced.

wide, could not match strides with that foe in upper stretch and lasted for the place. THE DOORMAN stalked the pace three wide, could not quicken with the
winner in upper stretch but kept on to gain the show late. SIGRUN FAST BOY saved ground in range and finished evenly at the rail to just miss second and
third. HUSBAND MATERIAL chased the pace two wide and was no threat in the drive. STORMY VICTORY played no factor while racing three wide. TIZ A
BEAST was outrun inside.

SMART SPENDING laid off the pace in the three path down the backside, moved up confidently from the two path early around the far turn, angled out
passing the quarter to take aim from the six path at the top of the lane, rallied past an inner trio passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. SHE FLED THE
SCENE had an awkward start, rated in the four path, came under right handed urging midway around the far turn, floated out to the eight path in upper
stretch, and ran on for place. CRYSTAL COAST stalked in the four path, was coaxed along from the three path rounding the far turn, swung from the five
path into the lane, and was one paced on her left lead for show. BOSTON PRINCESS set the pace in the two path, received a right handed cue while just
off the rail midway around the far turn, floated out to the four path in upper stretch, lost the lead just before the eighth pole, and faded. GOOD BRIGHT
FLAMES laid up close in the three path early, was driven from the two path into the far turn, tipped out to the four path at the top of the lane, had to steady
passing the eighth pole, and flattened. WICCA WISDOM trailed in the five path and never threatened. MOON ROSE tracked in the two path but weakened
in the stretch.

WHISKEY PARK had his head turned at the start, advanced four wide around the turn, took over in upper stretch and drew off under drive. VALUED CAJUN
stalked the early pace three wide, took the lead near the half-mile pole, led to upper stretch and just lasted for the place. ANCHISES had early speed
between foes, vied inside around the turn and kept on well enough to save the show. FIVEEYESONSKYSTARS raced off the pace three and four wide,
continued on the left lead in the lane, lugged in and lacked the needed rally. JAMAICA REDD had early speed two wide and retreated around the turn. SON
OF A SLEW played no factor while racing three wide. CADRON SETTLEMENT raced up close inside and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
MUNTALIQ laid off the pace inside early, advanced from the two path after the half, waited behind the leader rounding the far turn, tipped out to the four
path to take aim at the top of the lane, and kicked on to draw clear in the final sixteenth. CHROMOTION tracked in the two path, was coaxed along to bid
passing the quarter, ran on to firmly lead from the three path passing the eighth pole, but was caught around the sixteenth to place. OCALA ROCKET
chased in the three path, was coaxed along in the four path around the far turn, floated out to the six path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show.
MILCHIN pulled along the inside around the first turn to go well clear entering the backstretch, received a right handed cue as a trio closed in midway
around the far turn, but lost the lead at the top of the stretch, and faded. YASUR bobbled at the start, raced wellback in the two path, drifted out in upper
stretch, and made no impact. BUILDER JAK stalked in the four path but backed up after a half. BLAZING TYREEK trailed in the five path and never
threatened. TREASURE FLAY rated in the five path but failed to menace.
