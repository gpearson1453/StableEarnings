TAP THAT MAGIC tracked the leaders through the turn under patient handling, angled out four wide turning for home to engage the leader in upper stretch
and pulled away convincingly through the lane. DANCING ON AIR pressed the pace from the fence throughout, kept on gamely in the lane to be second
best while unable to match strides with the winner. DRUNKLE stalked the pacesetter to midway on the turn, made a three wide bid at the quarter pole to
take a brief lead and weakened in the lane. BOUJIE BETZ pressed the pace from two wide to the head of the stretch and tired coming home.

SHOWDOWN KING reserved off the pace to midway on the turn, circled five wide with a rally turning for home, engaged the leaders at the eighth pole and
was going away at the wire. VERY DEBONAIRE tracked the leaders to the turn, steadily gained ground on the bend, angled four wide at the top of the lane
to take a very brief lead just inside the the eighth pole and was out-finished in deep stretch. ON AN ISLAND stalked the pacesetter to the quarter pole, took
command in upper stretch and weakened through the drive. DUKE SKYWALKER hesitated at the start giving the field several lengths and rallied passed
weaker rivals in the lane with a late rally. NEON DEION was well placed just off the leaders along the rail on the turn, was called upon at the five-sixteenths
pole and lacked a response. DISCO CENTS set the pace on a clear lead and gave way turning for home.

FIELDER tracked the loose leader to the turn, steadily closed the margin on the pacesetter and was up in deep stretch in a confidently handled ride.
FLASHINTHENIGHT sped to the lead to take command with a wide advantage to the quarter pole and could not hold the winner off while finishing willingly
to hold the place. KEYSTONE HANK slow early to be well off the pace, continued to trail significantly to the top of the lane and showed late interest to be up
for the show. CHARLIE CHARLIE broke alertly, settled in hand to be off the pacesetter and made a mild gain through the lane without serious impact.

GOTHAM GRAY pressed the pace from two wide while well in hand, took command turning for home and finished willingly to just hold on late. HOPE SHE
COMES stalked the pace from three wide throughout, rallied steadily down the stretch to just miss. ELLYMARIE reserved off the pace in the early going,
gained ground along the fence through the turn and failed to sustain the rally through the drive. SHACKLED BY LUST set a pressured pace to upper stretch
and weakened in the lane. BELLA SKYE was not a threat. ROUNDBBALL chased the leaders from between rivals through the turn and faded.

Footnotes
GATITA SUAVE stalked the pacesetter from the fence through the turn, cut the corner turning for home to quickly snatch a clear lead and held the closer
safe through the drive. CLOUD IN THE WIND tracked the leaders to the quarter pole, rallied while circling five wide and made a steady gain through the
stretch drive but could not get to the winner. SHE HAD A SECRET trailed to the head of the lane, angled six wide and showed late interest to be along for
the show. WOK DON'T RUN mounted an early bid from three wide into the turn to loom at the quarter pole and failed to sustain the rally in the stretch.
GOOD TO BE TRUGE set the pace on a clear lead and weakened in upper stretch. MY JANNET failed to menace.

MEANT TO BE LUCKY sped to the lead into the first turn, was well rated on a clear lead down the backside, widened the advantage on the far turn and was
never challenged coming home as much best. FRED GEORGE (IRE) tracked the paced from the fence, rallied along the rail in the stretch to be up for the
place. TAP THE SKY stalked the pace the entire way and failed to mount a closing rally finishing evenly. TEMPUS unhurried for the first five-eighths and
rallied five wide belatedly in the lane. STREAMSONG went evenly without impact. LESLIE CHOW raced mid-pack down the backside, rallied on the far turn
and flattened out. EXPRESS STAR was slow early and never posed a threat. RANGER BLUE contended for a half and faded.

PARTNER TOURS set a pressured pace to the head of the lane while well rated, responded when called upon to open a clear lead and prevailed in a game
effort. INAPPROPRIATE trailed for the first quarter, made a steady advance circling the field to be prominent turning for home and finished well to be up for
the place. MISCHIEF WARRIOR pressed the pace for three quarters from three wide and kept-on through the lane while unable to go with the winner. CITY
LEADER raced up to contention down the backside sneaking up an opening along the rail to be prominent into the far turn, lost position on the bend and
came on in the lane to be gaining late. THREE O ONE tracked the pace from two wide and rallied mildly in the lane. RAPA NUI passed tiring rivals. COLD
PLUNGE was not a threat. FLIGHT CATCHER dueled on the pace from between rivals for the first three-eighths, backed out to a stalking position down the
backside and gradually gave way on the far turn.
