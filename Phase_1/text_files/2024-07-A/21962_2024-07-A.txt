Footnotes
AA SWEET VICTORY was allowed to settled then rallied three wide on the turn, was in a long drive and powered to the front in mid stretch to be best in the
end. TM PURNCESS chased the early pace while two wide, made a bid turning for home but was no match for the winner in late stretch. RB MUNCHIE set
the early pace then drew off on the turn but weakened in the stretch. WMA BIG BABY chased the early pace while inside, was making a bid on the turn then
faltered in the stretch. WMA DELIGHT trailed while outrun. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to
arrive at the most accurate time.
