Footnotes
COLLIN'S GREY LADY broke alertly to take command from the gate, set the pace under mild pressure thoughout, responded when called upon in upper
stretch to repel the challenges from the inside and outside in a game effort. STEPHANIE MY LOVE bobbled at the start, quickly recovered to press the pace
from three wide, lost position turning for home, angled inside the drifting pacesetter in the lane and came on again to re-claim the place. MORGANS COVE
unhurried for the first quarter, rallied four wide on the turn to loom in upper stretch and hung though the lane. ASTONISHING ANABEL showed brief speed
to pressure the pace from the rail early, dropped to the rear of the field into the turn and chased the pack home.

Footnotes
ASUE stalked the pace from the fence to the turn, tipped out to the two path on the bend while in tight quarters with outside rival, continued to steadily
advance on the pacesetter through the stretch and took control in deep stretch to prevail. TRIXIE'S TIME tracked the leaders through the turn from the rail,
angled five wide in upper stretch and closed well belatedly to be gaining late. MADE TO HUSTLE set the pace under mild pressure through quick fractions,
responded when called upon turning for home, battled through the drive and was outkicked late in the lane. SHORTY MAC pressed the pace from three
wide to the turn, was tentative when inside rival tipped out leaving the three-eighths pole, and finished evenly unable to mount a closing rally.
IMNOTONETOCOMPLAIN raced mid-pack throughout and rallied mildly in the stretch without impact. LA LIMA was slow early and never threatened. FAST
LANI steadily faded. THE RIDER OF SHORTY MAC CLAIMED FOUL FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE THREE-EIGHTHS POLE BY THE WINNER, UPON
REVIEW THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
I DON'T SEE COLORS tracked the leaders early, commenced a rally on the turn, engaged the pacesetter midway down the lane and pulled clear in deep
stretch. REBEL INVASION set the pace under mild pressure early, opened a clear advantage on the turn, dug-in down the lane when challenged, was no
match for the winner but finished willingly to be second best. EASTER BET pressed the pace early, settled off the pacesetter on the bend, was in striking
distance in upper stretch and lacked a closing kick. MAKE ME LUCKY was fractious in the gate, lunged when the gates opened to be at the back of the field
and closed ground in the lane showing good late energy. STRIDER'S SLIDER was well placed just off the leaders turning for hoem and falttened out in the
lane. BAZINGA D was one-paced and failed to menace. TIZ SPEEDY was not a threat. PICTURE THIS raced in contention for a half mile and came up
empty.

TERMSOFENGAGEMENT hopped at the start, rushed up to be prominent while splitting rivals down the backside under urging, took command nearing the
quarter pole and drew off unchallenged in the lane. EMPTY MY POUCH tracked the leaders from four wide through the turn and found his best stride late in
the lane to be up for the place. MAKOTO pressed the pace from the fence to the quarter pole, cut the corner to loom in upper stretch and failed to sustain
the bid in the lane. MO MOSCATO set a pressured pace to the five-sixteenths pole and weakened coming home. SUGAR'S LAST HOPE failed to menace.
ROAN FOR THE ROSE was not a factor.

SHOWSTOPPER COPPER sped to the lead from the gate, opened a clear advantage on the turn while well in hand and drew off unthreatened in the lane
as much the best. SANDY'S REFUGEE tracked the leader on the turn from the fence, was set to a drive midway on the turn and kept-on to be second best.
MAT MATTERS reserved off the early pace, swung wide turning for home and showed late energy to be along for the show. WISECRACK WARRIOR went
evenly failing to menace. MY MAGIC STAR chased the pacesetter from three wide and flattened out late in the drive. MALIBU KNIGHT reared at the start,
regrouped to rush into contention and dropped back as no threat. LEMON BREEZE was not a factor.

SOUPER ROYAL MOON prompted the early pace through the first turn, moved up two wide to duel on the lead down the backside, took control on the far
turn, widened the advantage to midway down the lane and held sway while weakening late. PURPLE SHIRT slow early to be the distant trailer, rallied
turning for home from five wide and closed well down the lane to be gaining in deep stretch. OVER AND THUNDER set a pressured pace for five-eighths,
could not go with the winner on the final bend and kept-on willingly through the lane. ZIP IT SCOTTY tracked the leaders throughout and failed to mount a
clsoing rally. SPEAK OF THE DEVIL contnded down the backstretch to be well placed on the final turn and flattened out down the lane.

CITIZEN MACK stalked the pacesetters to the top of the lane, found his best stride inside the eighth pole to surge late and be up in time.
BROKENHEARTED dueled from two wide from midway on the turn to deep stretch, took a late lead in a determined drive only to be nailed by the late
charging closer in the final strides in a game effort. NORTHWOODS sped to the lead from the gate, set a pressured pace battling on the lead to deep
stretch and was just outkicked in a too good to lose effort. CALL ME NOW was set to an early drive on the the turn and failed to respond. KEEP DEM
TALKING showed early foot to be prominent briefly, dropped to the rear of the field down the backside and was never a threat.
