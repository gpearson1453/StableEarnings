Footnotes
SPALIDAY was off a bit slow, trailed the field on the inside, moved up inside passing the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch, rallied three wide, kicked
in willingly when asked, ran by the pacesetter and was ridden out. MADAME MISCHIEF set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn, led into the
stretch, edged away, dug in gamely in the final furlong and was no match for the winner. LADY DE BERRY tracked on the inside, saved ground on the far
turn, angled out three wide entering the stretch, rallied mildly and got up for third. PROGENY pressed the pace racing close up two wide, bid on the far turn,
dueled, weakened some in the stretch drive and was outkicked for the show spot. BROCKNARDINI pulled between rivals in the early stages, stalked two
wide, chased three wide on the far turn and tired. ALCOHOL broke outward, raced three wide early, settled two wide off the pace and faded.

MADNESS stalked the pacesetter, drifted out a bit on the turn, rallied outside entering the stretch, dueled with KEEP ON ROCKIN and drew clear under
urging in the final sixteenth. KEEP ON ROCKIN tracked on the inside, rallied between horses entering the stretch, dueled with the winner, dug in gamely
inside of that rival and came up second best. NO FAKE raced off the pace, moved up inside on the turn, checked behind rivals at the furlong marker, angled
out, rallied late and got up for third. DERBY GIFT was bumped at the start, showed good early speed to set the pace, raced well off the inside turning for
home, drifted in at the eighth pole, weakened and lost third. SPECIAL AFFAIR was outrun early and closed belatedly outside. LOVE LIKE CRAZY raced off
the pace and did not factor. TABOR TIME was bumped at the start, chased three wide, chased on the turn and faded. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the
stretch run, the race was declared official.
