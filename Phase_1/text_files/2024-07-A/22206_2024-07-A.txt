Footnotes
TORIADOR quickly went to the front, saved ground while showing the way, responded to a looming threat from FLASHFORDANI, and held safely.
FLASHFORDANI stalked the pace while three wide, lodged a bid nearing the stretch but was unable to reach the leader and flattened out.
GABBYSONHOLIDAY rated off the pace inside, dropped back in the far turn, and passed tiring rival late. SMART PLAY went three to four wide into the
opening turn, stalked four wide, lodged a bid at the quarter pole and came up empty in the drive.

WHATWOMENWANT was the quickest to the turn, opened up through the turn, saw margins diminish in the stretch, and held on under a late drive.
HOLIDAY'S AGAIN hustled away, gained steadily on the leader through the drive and missed after a good late effort. MR MIEZIE was outsprinted to the
turn, raced in closest pursuit through the turn, and lacked a closing response. TABULA ROSSO bumped leaving, raced wide leaving the backstretch and
faded into the stretch. MY MUM'S MUD bumped away from the gate, and was outrun.

drove clear under handling. WORKIN FOR THE MAN broke outward leaving, raced in close quarters into the opening turn, moved up alongside CHICKS
DIG CAPES to challenge the front, was unable to sustain the bid that was needed. COPPER MEIN fractious in the gate, contested the pace, dueled in the
final turn, was unable to move on with rival and faded. SILVER TIP took back in traffic into the opening turn, and bid belatedly. SUPER SENSE stalked four
to five wide, and was outrun. SUNNY WAY steadied in traffic leaving the backstretch, shifted out and tired early.

DR. DAVE brushed leaving the gate, stalked the pace while four wide, moved up into striking position leaving the backstretch, overtook the leader at the
quarter pole, and won going away. BROKEN PROMISES rated well off the pace from the four path, swung wide into the lane, closed gradually under
encouragement and got by late for place honours. DOUG'S HERO brushed leaving, was quickest leaving the chute, led the way leaving the backstretch,
was overtaken at the quarter pole, and was worn down late. ANNAMARIA pressed the pace while five wide, was unable to keep pace with the field and
gave way. B B'S WILDFIRE stalked from the two path, took back out of traffic, chased inside and failed to menace. SPOT ON JOLEE brushed entering the
backstretch, stalked the pace while four wide, and tired early.

THEY CALL ME TOM vied outside for the early lead, gained the advantage at the quarter pole, was kept to task and held safely. NO REJOYCE stalked the
early pacesetters, and closed well late. KITTY HOUSE went four wide into the opening turn, was bumped leaving the final turn, and rallied for show.
POCKETFULOFDREAMS hustled outside, lugged in at the head of the lane bumping into KITTY HOUSE, and was outfinished for show. MYSTIC SALLY
bumped leaving then was sent for speed, was overtaken nearing the quarter pole, and faded. OKI lacked a clear path leaving, was gapped and offered a
late bid. SPIRIT CHASER bumped and showed little.

STREET VENDOR contended the pace inside of TAKE CHARGE CURLY, gained the advantage nearing the quarter pole, drifted out under left-handed
urging at the top of the stretch, and held under a drive. BREAKING THE BANK raced five-wide through the backstretch, chased inside through the far turn,
rallied inside and earned second. LATE NIGHT LIVING stalked the pace while four to five wide, closed steadily and weakened in the final yards.
HANDSOME HENRY saved ground inside, shifted out at the eighth pole, lost his path at the sixteenth pole, and gave a late effort. DERECHO DANDY
tracked the pacesetters, was roused entering the stretch, and gave way late. TAKE CHARGE CURLY pressured the early pace, gained a short advantage
leaving the backstretch, and came up empty in the drive. SAWCHUK chased five wide and tired early.
