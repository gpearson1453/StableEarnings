Footnotes
DARE TO BREEZE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand two to three paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside
through the turn patiently handled until given a notch and a tap to the right shoulder spinning three wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a very light
drive receiving taps with the crop to the right shoulder through stretch to the finish to prevail. GERLIN'S EMPIRE coaxed from the start, chased four paths
off the inside early on and then two to three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch,
proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors clear of the rest. MISCHIEF MAXEY chased just off the inside until tucked
inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.
MEZCALIFORNIA coaxed from the gate, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside into the turn, came under
coaxing with three furlongs to go, cut the corner into upper stretch and improved position in the stretch. AMORE SOFIA hard to load prior to the start, was
applied the blindfold and refused to move and then got taken in front of the gate and backed into the stall, got bumped at the break and forced to steady
when BISA broke inwards and conceded four to five lengths to the front, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside
through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled seven to eight wide into upper stretch and tired. KATERINA RISTOVA chased along the
inside and then just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, tired. BISA reluctant to load prior to the
start, had the front of the gate opened to coerce loading and then burst on through tossing the rider but being held from running off due to the hard hold of
the assistant starter and was brought back behind the gate and reloaded, broke in at the start bumping AMORE SOFIA and then bobbled heavily and was
taken hold of conceding four to five lengths to the front, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CARL SPACKLER (IRE) brushed the outside of the gate at the start, went two then three wide on the first turn, moved up with six furlongs to run, stalked the
pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path when asked on the far turn, was carried five wide into the stretch, took the lead near the three-sixteenths
pole, dueled outside of the runner-up in the final furlong and proved best under strong urging. TALK OF THE NATION was hustled to the front, showed the
way in the two path, was asked outside the quarter-pole, spun four wide into the stretch then was headed by the winner near the three-sixteenths pole,
dueled inside of that foe in the final furlong and missed while clear for the place. NORTHERN INVADER broke awkwardly and was off slow, spotted the front
a couple lengths, settled at the rear while off the inside, was roused in the two path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, pursued the top
two in the stretch and lacked the needed kick while well clear for third. CALL ME HARRY was coaxed from the gate, saved ground on the first turn, settled
off the pace, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, chased inside on the far turn and came up empty.

TOP GUNNER chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through
the final furlong, seized command trading leans with I GOT NO MUNNY a sixteenth from home and fought gamely to the finish to prevail by a head. I GOT
NO MUNNY shied out at the start in reaction to CELESTIAL GLAZE, who broke outwards, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, came in slightly straightened away forcing CELESTIAL GLAZE to pause when taking command at the
three-sixteenths, dug in directed out to look the aforementioned foe in the eye a furlong out, traded leans fighting gamely and clinging to command until the
sixteenth marker, battled on to the end but was ultimately bested on the wire. CELESTIAL GLAZE broke out at the start, chased four wide until tucked to the
two path briefly before heading to the rail half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, paused as
the aforementioned foe drifted in front with three-sixteenths to go and then ran on to the finish to secure the show honors. LOST IN ROME got bumped at
the start by MILTON THE MONSTER, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. DIDINGER chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, angled three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. NELSON AVENUE hustled from the gate, raced three then two wide in closest
aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and took over command near the quarter pole, swung three wide for home, yielded the front
with three-sixteenths to go and weakened in the late stages. POPPY'S PRIDE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front nearing the quarter pole and spun just off the inside for home, then weakened in the stretch. MILTON THE
MONSTER broke outwards hitting the off side stall at the start and then bumping LOST IN ROME, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ILLUMINARE was hustled from the gate, showed speed inside of foes then contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied inside on the turn, was asked
while moving further away from the rest in tandem with the runner-up coming to the quarter-pole, dueled inside that foe in the stretch, came under a
right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, shook clear outside the sixteenth-pole then drew away into the final forty yards and proved much the best
while eased up late. CLASSIC LEGACY showed speed between horses then contested the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, moved
further clear of the rest in unison with the winner while asked approaching the quarter-pole, dueled outside of that foe under a right-handed crop in upper
stretch, fought on even terms into the final furlong then was disposed of outside the sixteenth-pole and proved no match while able to get the place. ABADIN
was hustled from the gate, showed speed between foes then chased on the outside, went four wide on the turn, pursued the top two in the stretch and
lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. VINCO tossed his head at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, was ridden along at
the rear, moved closer late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response.
KUNSHAN BRIDGE showed speed between horses then pressed the pace on the outside, chased the leading duo in the the three path on the turn,
dropped back into the stretch and tired. AGOO showed brief speed on the outside then dropped back, climbed after moving in behind horses outside the
five-eighths pole, shifted out near the nine-sixteenths pole, went five wide on the turn, dropped to the three path at the quarter-pole and faltered then was
eased but walked off.

REBEL RED (GB) settled tracking the front just off the inside from near the rear of the field patiently handled until placed to coaxing nearing the quarter
pole, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch, closed well through to the finish and was up late to prevail edging away at the end. UNIT ECONOMICS
(GB) lunged at the break, raced just off the pace just off the inside under a firm hold between foes, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three
to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just inside the sixteenth marker, then got overhauled in the final jumps to the finish and was forced
to settle for the place honors. HUNT BALL saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing near the quarter pole before being set down angled
three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was in tight between foes briefly and then had his seam close down when unable to keep
pace with it and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. SAMBURU (GB) coaxed from the gate, attended the pace of the leader from the outside
in the two path, came under coaxing near the quarter pole when seizing command and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive
to the eighth pole, dug in under threat and was caught just inside the sixteenth pole, then weakened in the late stages. RAMBLIN' WRECK two to three wide
in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. TRANSACTIONAL (GB)
splayed his legs at the start and was away awkward bumping DEVILSGOTACAUSE, raced rank under restraint into the first turn along the rail when under
restraint, tracked along the inside coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the late going.
DEVILSGOTACAUSE got bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe, showed the way in hand along the inside facing little pressure save through the
presence of SAMBURU latched on to his outside, had the pressure intensify into the far turn and came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, yielded the
front and took the inside route into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. SUERTE lunged at the break, raced three wide through the first turn stacked
outside a pair of rivals and then three to four wide down the backstretch, went four wide into the far turn, then bolted out from the five-sixteenths to end up
ten wide at the head of the stretch, got corrected inwards straightened away and tired.

Footnotes
STRICTLY TABOO moved in while settling off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was roused four wide into the stretch, rallied outside to get the
lead inside the furlong marker, kicked clear outside the sixteenth-pole and held under steady urging. U SHOULD B DANCING was reserved towards the
rear while between horses, went around the turn in the two path, was roused near the quarter-pole, moved out under a drive in the vicinity of the furlong
marker and finished with good energy to garner the place. FANCYPANTS JULIANA brushed with a foe at the start, settled on the outside, went four then
five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch, gained in the final furlong and showed good courage to get the show. STOLEN FUTURE settled
between horses, went two to three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and improved to just miss the show. TURRIGA was reluctant to load,
showed speed while hustled from the start then was taken in hand when the leader crossed in front, tracked that foe on the outside down the backstretch,
was let out some in three path on the turn, pursued the leader under a drive in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. ACT OF CONGRESS angled in while
going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, was asked after turning into the stretch then came
under a drive, led into the final furlong then was overtaken by the winner and weakened. BEACH CRUISER was hustled from the start then taken under a
tight hold early, raced just off the pace while rated under restraint, drafted inside on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick.
QUICK POWER NAP brushed with a rival at the start and was last away, settled between horses, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into
the stretch and lacked the needed response. CITY BLOCKS was reserved towards the rear, went two then three wide on the turn, was roused near the
five-sixteenths pole, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BERN ROSEY BERN was hustled from the gate then settled on the inside, lost
position behind HONEST BANKER when that foe dropped back near the five-sixteenths, moved to the two path to go around that opponent shortly
thereafter and was no factor. HONEST BANKER was hustled from the gate, raced just off the pace, dropped to the rail late on the backstretch, came up
empty along the rail on the far turn and retreated.

Footnotes
REYNOLDS CHANNEL moved up after the start then settled towards the front, shifted from the two path to the four path while chasing on the turn, gained to
make a bid in upper stretch, took the advantage before the furlong marker and edged clear under strong urging. HURRICANE NELSON angled in while
going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the
winner nearing the furlong marker and was outfinished while clear for the place. UPSTANDING made light contact with a foe while off a step slow, rushed
up on the inside to race just off the pace, was asked while saving ground on the turn, chased the top two into the final furlong, moved out near the
sixteenth-pole and safely secured the show. CALL PROTECTION tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, pursued the top two
under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. POINT CLEAR bumped lightly with an opponent while off a step slow, raced well back in the field, went
two then three wide for most of the turn, shifted four then five wide late on that bend, was driven six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick then
just missed the superfecta. COMMUTED stumbled badly at the start and was off slow, raced well back in the field, saved ground on the turn and failed to
respond. READY AS EVER was off slow and spotted the front several lengths, raced at the rear under urging, went two to three wide on the turn, angled out
outside the furlong marker and was no factor. FROSTELLE settled off the pace, moved out near the five-eighths pole, was urged along late on the
backstretch, dropped back near the seven-sixteenths pole, went three wide on the turn and failed to rally. HEDGE THE RISK settled on the outside, dropped
from the three path to the two path early on the turn, moved to the four path late on that bend, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LIGHT
THE WAY broke a tad awkwardly but towards the front, was urged along off the pace, went five then four wide on the turn and came up empty.
ESCONDIDO stumbled bad at the start and was off a bit slow, was urged along off the pace, dropped back while bearing out from the four path to the eight
path on the turn, floated nine wide into the stretch and faltered. TAPIT'STALEOFVERVE was off slow then dropped back, raced near the rear under urging,
went four wide on the turn, floated seven wide into the stretch and also faltered.

Footnotes
WHITEBEAM (GB) moved in while going to the front, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, was well rated while setting the pace through moderate
fractions, controlled the action on the inside going around the far turn, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole then came under a strong
hand-ride, was given a pop of a right-handed crop at the furlong marker then switched to a left-handed crop and held under strong urging. MOIRA was taken
in hand early, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, rounded the far turn in the two path, was roused three wide into the stretch then came
under a drive, brushed with COPPICE while keeping that foe behind horses near the furlong marker, jostled with that opponent outside the sixteenth-pole
and finished with good courage to get up for the place in the final stride. GINA ROMANTICA established a forward position early, tucked into the two path
for the run around the opening bend, was rated just off the pace, ranged up three wide on the far turn, was given her cue at the quarter-pole, chased the
winner under a drive in the stretch and finished with good courage then was denied the place in the final stride while able to get the show. DIDIA (ARG) was
rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted behind the leader on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, chased behind the winner under urging into the
final furlong, moved to the two path near the sixteenth-pole and was out-kicked. COPPICE (GB) was taken under a hold early then reserved on the inside,
moved to the two path into the stretch, came out some under a drive while kept in behind horses by a rival, brushed with that foe near the furlong marker
then jostled outside the sixteenth-pole, continued behind horses to the wire and finished willingly. MISSION OF JOY was taken under restraint early, raced
between foes in the two path on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under some urging with three furlongs to run, traveled around the far turn in
the two path, spun three wide into the stretch, angled out inside the three-sixteenths pole and gained some but failed to impact. EVVIE JETS went to to
three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the two path on the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, chased between
horses into the final furlong, steadied in tight quarters inside the furlong marker and weakened. FLUFFY SOCKS saved ground on the first turn, was
reserved near the rear, moved from the rail to the two path on the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, shifted out in the vicinity of the furlong marker
and lacked the needed kick. CHILI FLAG (FR) tucked in down the opening straightaway, rounded the first turn in the two path, was unhurried near the back,
went three then four wide on the far turn, was roused six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. NEECIE MARIE traveled three wide on the first turn,
was reserved on the outside, came under urging in the three path on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch, swapped back to her inside lead near the
furlong marker and failed to rally.

Footnotes
RITHM NIC brushed with a foe just after the start while hustled, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the three then two path on the turn, responded
well under the crop while in front in the stretch and held under strong urging. FEATHERS ROAD settled comfortably off the pace, went two then three wide
for most the turn, moved to the four then five path late on that bend, rallied outside in upper stretch and closed well to just miss while narrowly up for the
place. FINAL VERDICT was hustled from the gate then well placed just off the pace, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn, chased the leader
under a drive into the final furlong, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, fought on well to the finish and just missed while narrowly able to get the show.
KING MOONRACER dropped back then settled on the outside, moved in late on the backstretch, was roused in the two path on the turn, pursued the leader
under a drive into the final furlong, gained to make a bid near the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly but just missed the trifecta. PLAYGROUND LEGEND
brushed with a foe after the start, settled towards the back, went three wide on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and improved position. THREE
ZERO was hustled from the gate, disputed the pace on the inside of the winner, vied along the rail on the turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong,
dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened. HEYMACKIT'SJACK dropped back then moved out before settling on the outside, went four wide on
the turn, came seven wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. SUGAR GRAY LEONARD was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn,
turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out near the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. DR OSERAN was off slow and spotted the front
several lengths, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. WAR TERMINATOR was well placed just off the pace, moved from the two path to the four
path on the turn and came up empty.
