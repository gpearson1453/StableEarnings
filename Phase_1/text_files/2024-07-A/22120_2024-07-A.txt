DIVINE FASHION rated a short lead inside, kept the edge over Flat Discount leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came under pressure at the five sixteenths
pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, ran clear leaving the turn and was kept sharp in the stretch. A LITTLE BIT CRAZY rated close off the rail the first
turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, drifted to the outside leaving the turn and dueled through the stretch
for second. SOMEBODY LOVES ME raced well back inside on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and improved steadily, rounded the far turn at
the rail and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. FLAT DISCOUNT stalked from the four path the opening turn, challenged approaching the seven
sixteenths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn but dropped back leaving the turn and flattened in the lane. WATERLOO ROSE rounded the first turn
in the five path, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn then angled in entering the stretch, but showed little
more.

eighths, dueled with the edge nearest the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled to widen in the lane. RAINBOWSNSUNSHINE took the lead passing
the five eighths pole, came under pressure toward the three eighths and dueled close two deep on the far turn, but dropped back while flattening stride
entering the stretch. LITTLE BABY GIRL entered the first turn about the four path, picked up the chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the five
path and came along to take third later yards. PRINCESS MARGARET raced in the five path the opening turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and showed little in the lane. COUSIN WINNIE stalked inside on the first turn then eased out entering the
backstretch, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn. SNEAKY LYNK settled in the four path the first turn and
showed little response after a half mile.

and held on well. HARLEY SIOUX was hustled to the lead leaving the chute and set a pressured pace, contested the edge two deep on the turn, was met
while drifting approaching the top of the lane and relented the win, though, dug in to hold second. BIG BOY OVI was bumped outward and into Big Joe B
leaving the gate then gave chase, raced in the three path on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. ROMANTIC WARRIOR gave
chase, raced in the four path on the turn, drifted leaving the turn and ran evenly in the lane. MEGS GOLDEN BOY chased through the backstretch, raced
near the rail on the turn and finished well. BIG JOE B was bumped soundly leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the
rail and showed little in the lane. HOLD DEM gave chase and rounded the turn about the five path. PEDAL TO THE MOON bore to the outside early then

then settled outside leaving the second turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the five path on the far turn, came along to take third mid-stretch and
showed little more. JUBA'S NOTION settled off the rail, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn.
