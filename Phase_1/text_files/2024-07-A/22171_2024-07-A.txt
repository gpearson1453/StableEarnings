Footnotes
TWENTY CINCO rushed to the front to establish the early pace, let up and came under a easy hand ride on the turn while being pressured by an outer foe,
then pulled away in the late stretch under right handed encouragement to prove best. IN SPITE OF IT settled back along the rail in the back trio to save
ground, rallied bid leaving the bend while shifting four wide and kept on to get up for the place position besting rivals. SECRET VERSE was unhurried early,
continued to save ground on the turn, came out five wide and rallied bid in late stretch and just missed the place prize. TENSAS BOLT moved up from the
inside to pursue the pace in the middle duo, menaced leaving the turn to gain second position in the early stretch, could not catch stable mate and was out
finished by two outer counterparts, missing the place winnings. FIND THE LIGHT broke outwardly and brushed foe then chased the pace with an inner rival
into the turn, came out three wide to rally bid and came up flat in the stretch. HOLIDAY CRUISE was no factor. GO LAUREN GO was brushed at the start,
then moved up while two wide to press the leaded on the turn while in a hard drive, was used up and tired in the stretch.

HOT GUNNER laid off the pace in the middle duo along the rail, then moved up between rivals on the turn, dug in gamely in the early stretch while shifting
out four wide, edged past the menacing trio to take over the lead in the final yards and prevail while in a strong drive. BILLY DIXON broke outwardly and
bumped foe, was allowed to settle in the back trio along the rail, was gaining on the turn, came out four wide and rallied bid, split rivals in the final yards and
was up for the place prize, besting the rest of the field. W G SECOND TO NONE was bumped at the start, then gained ground steadily from the inside to
gain command heading into the turn, was in a long drive in the early stretch then gave way and held onto the show winnings. WAYLON'S GUITAR dueled
with an outer foe in the early furlongs, stalked the emerging leader on the turn while continuing to rally with said foe, was in a long drive then gave way.
MULTIPLE OPINIONS went head to head with an inner foe into the turn while stalking the pace while three wide, continued to rally gamely down the lane
then gave way. BROOKLYN ALLEY CAT saved ground in the early stages while racing towards the rear, split rivals leaving the bend, came out five wide
and rallied too little too late. WARHAMMER bid for the lead from the inside, then settled back at the half and lacked rallying in the remaining furlongs.
RAYDEN AND REMI chased the pace while three wide, moved up to the two path to urge steadily on the turn, then flattened out in the stretch. ONE
FROSTY DAY was no menace. TIP TOE JOE was off slowly and no factor. MY GOLDEN CALBO was no factor.

MANIFESTED vied from the inside before gaining command at the five furlong pole, cleared the turn then drew off in the stretch and was ridden out to prove
much the best. OBVIOUS CONCLUSION was unhurried early, then moved up along the rail on the turn, fanned out five wide and passed inner foes to gain
second position in the late stretch but could not catch the cleared leader. WITT SWEET SIXTEEN chased the leaders from the inside into the turn, rallied
bid in the upper stretch to gain third position, needed more and held onto the show winnings. FIRST CAPE vied while four wide early, then settled back to
chase the pace while two wide, rallied a mild bid in the upper stretch and came up empty. SHAKINTHEMONARCHY battled between foes, then pursued the
emerging leader on the turn while in second position, rallied a mild bid in the upper stretch then gave way. TERE'SDRAMAQUEEN was no menace. CANDY
BINDER was bumped at the start, then raced while three wide between the two fields of rivals, moved up to rally a gamely bid on the turn, could not retain
bid and flattened out. MUCHO MACHO CAM was impeded at the start and was no menace. TRADE TRAVELER was impeded at the start and failed to rally.
MORO TRENDSETTER veered inwardly and was no factor. DADA BOOM RIDGE broke inwardly and bumped foe, then lugged out impeding another and

BLUE LIGHT laid off the pace along the rail, then rallied bid leaving the bend to edge past outer foes mid stretch, gained command and held on well to
prevail. EMPERADOR was off slowly, then split rivals in the late backstretch while coaxing two wide, fanned out six wide in the upper stretch, rallied bid to
get up for the place position and needed more to catch the leader. MYSTERY MO chased the pace while two wide, then came out four wide leaving the
bend to rally in the late stretch and was able to get up for the show place. DRIVEHAPPY was unhurried early, then swung seven wide leaving bend and
offered a mild bid in the late stretch and came up empty. BANDERA AZTECA veered inwardly at the start, then raced mid pack along the rail, steadied at
the five furlongs marker, offered a bid leaving the turn, met traffic, then angled out four wide and kept on to no avail. CLUE tracked the pace from the inside
early, was met with inner rivals on the turn to rally bid while three wide, came out five wide in the upper stretch and lacked the needed response. SUITABLE
dueled from the inside into the turn, was confronted by outer foes in the upper stretch, drifted out while in a gamely bid then gave way. STEINBECK dueled
with an inner foe throughout, was hard used leaving the turn and dropped back. MALIBU S S was unhurried early, then ducked in and hit rail unseating the
rider, did not finish and walked off. There was an INQUIRY following the race in regards to MALIBU SS unseating rider.

Footnotes
GLENALL (IRE) tracked the pace from the inside while being well rated, was roused leaving the far turn to gain command in the upper stretch and was kept
to task down the lane to prevail. CINNAMON FACE showed the way into the first turn to set the pace, was in a long drive coming off the far turn, was
overtaken by GLENALL in the upper stretch and held onto the place position. WILD EXPRESS saved ground in the early stages, then rallied a gamely bid
leaving the far turn while two wide and was able to get up for the show position in the final sixteenth. COLORS OF THE WIND was allowed to settle along
the rail with the trailing rivals in the early furlongs, then moved between rivals on the far turn to rally bid in the upper stretch while four wide, steadied off
heels then kept on down the lane to no avail. TALKIN CADEE was unhurried early, then rallied bid in the late stretch and needed more. TEMPLAR RED
raced in the middle pair from the inside, then fanned out five wide leaving the far turn and rallied too little too late in the stretch. SHE'SSKYSTHELIMIT
stalked the pace while two wide in the early furlong, then moved up to press the leader on the far turn while three wide, could not gain command under a
mild bid and gave way. DOUDOUDOUWANADANCE raced in the middle pair while two wide, then dropped back heading into the far turn, came out six
wide in the upper stretch to rally in the stretch and came up empty. LADY JAE was allowed to settle in the two path towards the back, then moved up along
the inside on the far turn to offer a mild bid in the stretch and was no threat.

SARA'S SHAMAN pursued the pace from the inside while in a steady hand ride, then rallied bid leaving the bend, gained command in the final furlong and
held on well to prevail. UNCLE BERLEY bid from the inside before taking command with five furlongs left, was in a long drive leaving the far turn,
maintained the lead while in a gamely bid then was out finished in the final yards. MO SATURDAYS chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch,
then moved up on the turn to gain second position, rallied a bid in attempt to overcome the leader, was unsuccessful and gave way and held onto the show
winnings. BOUGIE JOE laid off the pace along the rail, was roused on the turn while two wide, rallied bid in the upper stretch while four wide and just
missed the show position. STAND PROUD was no threat. AIN'T THAT A KICK was no threat. OPTIMAL TRIP was no factor. LIONS NOT SHEEP was no
factor. ROCKING ROCKET brushed foe at the start and was no menace. CLASSIC MOMENT led the way briefly before pressing UNCLE BERLEY down
the late backstretch then faded after the turn. RUNHAPPY D'ORO was no threat. TITLE CONTENDER failed to rally. WIREWYRE was brushed at the start
and was no rally.

Footnotes
RUBY CANTU was reserved in the early furlongs, came under coaxing at the top of the far turn to split rivals, dug in gamely, angled out three wide in the
late stretch and kept on and was up in time to prevail. KAUSE I'M DEVINE saved ground in the early furlongs, then was gaining ground leaving the
backstretch to rally bid while four wide on the far turn, gained command in mid stretch then was caught at the wire. GRACIE'S KITTEN veered outwardly at
the start, was unhurried early, then closed well in the late stretch while passing rivals to get up for the show prize. TAKE MY PICTURE was allowed to settle
in the trailing duo along the rail, then swung five wide coming off the far turn to rally a bid in the late stretch and kept on to no avail. HIGH TONE WOMAN
moved between rivals early, then steadied heading into the first turn, pursued the leaders from the inside down the backstretch, then steadied again at the
top of the far turn, regained stride to rally a gamely bid heading into the stretch while four wide then gave way. HOLIDAY PRESENCE was allowed to settle
towards the back along the rail, then offered a mild bid in the early stretch and came up empty. ON WING angled inwards to press the pace into the first turn
and down the backstretch, gained command on the far turn and into the early stretch then gave way grudgingly. OLGA'S GOLD DANCER set the pace from
the inside in the early stages, then stalked the emerging leader on the far turn before giving way in the stretch. BLING IT K K was rank early, then chased
the pace while two wide, inched up on the far turn under while in a steady drive, steadied at the quarter pole then stopped.
