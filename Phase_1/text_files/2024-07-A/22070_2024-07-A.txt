Footnotes
ALYANAABI rated from outside, moved clear three wide when allowed on the bend, was roused leaving the turn then lengthened command under
encouragement the final furlong. SHANGHAI POINT overcame a step slow start to race just behind the early speed, altered out three wide after a quarter
mile, took over second leaving the turn, drew clear for the place upper stretch then could only just hold his position late. DEVIL'S RULE made a large leap
into the air when the gate opened, lost ground widest through the bend and gained third outside rivals inside the last eighth. FEROCITY raced in contention
four or five wide but lacked a significant stretch bid. GALLANT BUCK vied for the early lead between horses but began to yield leaving the turn. ROAD
GAME displayed early speed from inside but began to fade before finishing a half mile.

Footnotes
HALO HONEY shared the lead just outside FRENCHYS TOAST, edged ahead in the lane, was clear inside the final furlong, all out in the late going and
held on. COOLTHING made a large leap from the gate, was boxed in behind the early speed on the bend, got through four wide into the stretch, rallied the
last eighth, gained second in the late going but was too late for the win. TEGWAR was checked behind traffic midway on the turn, lost considerable ground
fanning to the middle of the track for the drive, surge deep stretch but also came up a bit short. FRENCHYS TOAST disputed the pace from inside then
slowly wore down in the stretch. MY BUDDY BROOKS also boxed in between rivals on the bend, was steadied when her path narrowed with two furlongs to
go, altered out to path six upper stretch and also made a strong bid inside the last eighth. BIKINI MARTINI broke somewhat slowly, stayed well off the inside
on the turn, angled in some for the stretch run and rallied belatedly the final furlong. FLASH CADILLAC hesitated as well at the start, progressed three wide
on the bend, swung out to path five for the stretch run then ran evenly between rivals in the late going. ALEXSIS broke slow and somewhat awkwardly then
bore inward, saved ground and was never a factor. SHOW ME THE LIGHT was also slow at the start and showed little. HARLEY'SRUNAWAYKID slow at
the break, as well, was soon far back, coasted in the stretch distancing himself from the field and was walked off.

Footnotes
UH OH IT'S MAGIC moved clear on the first bend, showed the way in hand off the rail, was roused on the second turn, drifted out leaving that turn then
steadily opened up under urging in the lane. TAPINYOURBLUEJEANS angled to the outside on the backstretch, took over second four wide on the second
bend, was no match for UH OH IT'S MAGIC in the stretch and could only hold his position late. WICKED GUS settled early, picked up his pace after a half
mile, angled out widest on the second turn, came into the lane from the middle of the track, showed late interest and proved clearly best of the rest.
TIZWOW was well placed inside for six furlongs, floated out entering the stretch and flattened. MYSTIC POWER was checked briefly to avoid SMILE LIKE
LYLE at the start, chased from outside, angled in on the second turn and failed to have a significant stretch bid. SOLOMON VANDY was soon well back,
just off the rail on the second bend, fanned out considerably for the drive, closed the gap inside the last furlong then altered out widest to gain a clear path in
the waning yards. SMILE LIKE KYLE broke inward, prompted the early pace from between rivals, was two wide on the second turn then began to yield from
behind TAPINYOURBLUEJEANS leaving that bend.

Footnotes
CREPE YARNS rated between rivals, angled in some to be just off the inside taking the second turn, rallied under mild urging in the stretch, took the lead
inside the last eighth then drew away the final sixteenth. MAC PANDOWDY settled just off the inside, picked up his pace after a half mile, progressed
through the second bend, came into the lane from path three, vied for the lead briefly outside CREPE YAMS inside the final furlong, was no match for that
one deep stretch but proved easily second best. TROY OUNCE was sent to contest the pace off the rail but inside ONE WAY HOME, moved ahead on the
second turn, drifted out some into the stretch and began to wear down inside the last furlong. ONE WAY HOME drifted a bit after the start to bump
LONESOME DREAM, vied for the lead outside TROY OUNCE, did not keep up leaving the second bend and flattened out for the drive. CARTE BLANCHE
chased from outside and had no late bid. LONESOME DREAM bumped shortly after the break, was an early contender, moved inside TROY OUNCE on the
backstretch then began to yield from path three on the second turn.

Footnotes
JUST AT MIDNIGHT was bumped then squeezed briefly between horses at the start, shared the lead between rivals, stayed in path four through the bend,
moved ahead leaving the turn, drifted out upper stretch, was straightened, drew off under urging then was wrapped up the final sixteenth. SPIRIT SMOKE
also squeezed between rivals at the break, advanced from inside on the turn, floated out some for the stretch run, took over second, was no match for JUST
AT MIDNIGHT the last eighth, lugged in some in the late going and could only hold her position. IT'S ON broke inward, bumping HER SPEAKER'S ON, was
steadied, gradually angled in on the backstretch, advanced along the rail through the turn and upper stretch to have a striking position with a furlong left but
leveled off in the waning yards. HER SPEAKER'S ON bumped from the rear at the start, raced in contention between foes, was caught in tight quarters after
a quarter mile, bumped with MOLLY'S TEMPLE nearing the bend, retreated, was just off the inside taking the turn, passed inside tired ones in the lane, lost
her path to SPIRIT SMOKE deep stretch and was altered out. CUPID'S HOPE was an early factor from outside, lost considerable ground widest through the
turn and had no late bid. RAIN ATTACK bumped with SPIRIT SMOKE at the start, pressed the early leaders from just outside, went for the lead on the bend
but gave way for the stretch run. WILDISH broke outward bumping JUST AT MIDNIGHT, was hustled to dispute the pace inside that one but began to faded
before finishing a half mile. MOLLY'S TEMPLE advanced between horses on the backstretch, was caught in tight quarters after two furlongs and bumped
then began to yield three wide on the turn.

Footnotes
DANZA TAXI shared the lead outside SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY, moved clear upper stretch, gradually lugged in under urging and maintained full control
while kept to task to the wire. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY chased the early speed from outside, saved ground taking the bend, slowly closed the gap through the
stretch, gained second inside the last sixteenth and could only hold his position late. GOLD SMOKE chased from inside, gradually angled out through the
turn fanning to six wide entering the lane, rallied belatedly between horses but caught SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY for third. SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY
displayed early speed just off the rail, did not stay with DANZA TAXI leaving the bend, floated out into the stretch, angled out some when his path was taken
by the latter nearing the eighth pole and slowly wore down in the waning yards. FEVER NATION progressed from outside on the backstretch to reach
contention three wide with a quarter mile left, lost ground staying outside DANZA TAXI entering the lane and flattened out. SWAGGY GEORGE chased
from just off the rail, swung out widest on the bend then had no stretch bid. VIOLENZA D'ORO was always outrun.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD RUBEN was kept close, went for the lead two wide on the turn, drifted out to path five into the stretch, moved clear then steadily drew off under
mostly hand urging. LARRY THE POET chased from inside, angled outside into the bend, came widest into the lane and caught LAYTON THE DAY for
second in the final strides. LAYTON THE DAY was soon clear and gradually angled to the inside, challenged leaving the turn, no match for WILDWOOD
RUBEN inside the last eighth and began to wear down late. LAKE MILLS raced in contention from inside for a half mile, also floated out for the stretch run
and began to flatten out. GRANDDADDYLONGLEGS fractious in the gate, was taken out, examined and okayed to run by the veterinarian, was a contender
toward the outside on the backstretch once the race began, two wide on the bend, swung out behind WILDWOOD RUBEN for the stretch run and gave way.
SWISS GUARD jostled briefly leaving the chute, soon trailed, saved ground and was never a factor. JACK SPRAT altered in some to keep a clear path
inside LAYTON THE DAY leaving the chute, jostled briefly with SWISS GUARD, chased from outside and showed little.
