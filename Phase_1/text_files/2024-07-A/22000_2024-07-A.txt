Footnotes
FAITHFUL TRUTH broke in, chased in range then lost ground past the half-mile pole, saved ground well off the speed through the turn, rallied along the
fence in next to DYIN A THIRST and outdueled that rival in the final fifty yards. DYIN A THIRST trailed two wide into the turn, remained at the back into the
stretch, rallied alongside FAITHFUL TRUTH through the lane and got edged on the line. PROMISE ME KAT away quickly to take control then dueled from
outside up the backstretch, fought four wide into the lane, took control from SWIFT HARMONY while drifting inward and yielded to the top pair in deep
stretch. SWIFT HARMONY hopped and broke inward, rushed up to duel from inside, fought three wide into the lane, shifted out into the hind-quarters of
PROMISE ME KAT and had to check at the sixteenth pole, then flattened to fourth. LONG LEGGED BABS stalked off the rail, two then three wide on the
turn, angled out leaving the bend and failed to threaten. SWEET ELLA RAE came out leaving the gate, chased from outside, put in a mild bid three deep at
the seven-sixteenths pole, chased the top pair five wide into the lane and weakened. LITTLE DUMPLING tracked off the rail then moved inside, came out
on the turn, entered the lane five wide and had little left for the drive. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INVOLVING THE INCIDENT AT THE SIXTEENTH POLE,
THE STEWARDS RULED THAT SWIFT HARMONY CAUSED HER OWN PROBLEMS WHEN SHE SHIED FROM INNER RIVALS AND HAD TO TAKE
UP BEHIND PROMISE ME KAT AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE. DUE TO A TIMING MALFUNCTION THE HALF-MILE FRACTION WAS
HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
FIREMAN DAN unhurried in the beginning and tucked inside, chased between rivals into the far turn, rallied to confront the top pair from outside midstretch
and proved best late. FROST ALERT stepped to the front and steered over to the rail, showed the way up the backstretch, drifted out a bit on the far turn,
led four wide into the lane, collared by JACK KEROUAC at the three-sixteenths pole, fought between rivals in the final furlong, dug down deep in the final
sixteenth but yielded grudgingly in the end. JACK KEROUAC stalked three wide early, exited the backstretch four wide, moved back to the three path on the
second bend, challenged inside the leader at the three-sixteenths pole, vied with outer rivals in the furlong grounds and could not summon the needed late
kick. WESTPORT CAPTAIN stalked two wide early, three then two wide on the second bend and faded in the stretch run. SYNTACTIC settled off the rail,
raced three deep into the far turn, trailed four wide into the stretch and failed to menace. MOESAHANDFUL tracked from inside through both turns and was
never a factor.

Footnotes
DENDERA chased three deep around the first turn, pressed outside on the backstretch and far turn, took over from LOVE OUR FAMILY midstretch and
drove clear. LOVE OUR FAMILY dueled in the two path early, took control on the backstretch and set the pace under pressure from DENDERA, maintained
a short lead through the far turn, lost command midstretch, stayed on into the final furlong, yielded in the final sixteenth but was clearly second best.
ENGLISH DANGER unhurried in the early going, dropped back to last and moved into the two path, raced along the rail into the far turn, eased off the fence
while passing a rival, spun three wide into the lane and was along for the show honors. UNA PALABRA dueled from inside around the first turn, chased the
leader up the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, tipped out into the lane and weakened. WARRIOR LADY chased four deep in the early going,
stalked two wide on the second bend, tipped out into the stretch and faded. RUN FOR MY HONEY chased six deep on the clubhouse turn, stalked outside
the top pair in the middle stages, went three wide into the far turn, angled out into the lane and tired. DE JORIA hustled from the gate and had to chase five
deep early, exited the backstretch three wide, trailed five wide into the lane and passed a tired rival.

Footnotes
ONE STRONG CAT fractious in the gate, sped clear and set the tone early, led along the inside then two wide into the stretch and drew off when called
upon. GETEMDUSTY chased outside rivals then two wide into the turn, moved out into the stretch, could not make any headway on the winner but bested
the rest. NEXT TRICK off slow to begin, moved into range from outside, rounded the bend three wide, got carried out by GETEMDUSTY into the stretch and
could not rally. NOTCH lacked early speed, trailed three wide into the turn, angled to the inside, moved off the fence in the lane and passed tired rivals.
BARSINI RED raced up close but had to put the brakes on when running on the heels of the winner early, chased two wide into the turn, swung six wide
approaching the stretch and weakened. SPOT D' ORO chased along the rail into the turn, drifted three wide leaving the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
AMELIA BLEU set the pace in the two path under pressure from inner rival, moved clear around the far turn and showed the way three wide into the stretch,
then drew away when called upon. HIGH FLYING GRACIE broke out and bumped, stalked from inside then moved into the two path, went three wide into
the far turn, took aim four wide leaving the turn, could not summon the needed response in the final furlong but was clearly second best. NICELY CURVED
raced in range from the four path, remained wide up the backstretch, navigated turn four to five wide and weakened in the drive but managed to hold third.
SMOOTH AS BUTTER chased two then three wide early, lost positions four deep on the second bend, churned on through the lane and regained a minor
award. CY'S SILKSTOCKING chased keenly in hand from inside then went up to press the leader along the rail, kept the heat on to the far turn, lost touch
with the winner around the bend, chased two wide into the lane and weakened. SENT BY ANGELS tracked three to four wide on the clubhouse turn, stayed
off the rail to the stretch and weakened. LADY CRUISER broke a bit slow, got bumped and shut off at the start, reserved on the inside then a bit off the rail,
chased inside a pair of rivals into the far turn, saved ground to the stretch and tired. ANOTHER SUMMER trailed three wide on the first turn, chased
between foes into the second bend, swung out past the five-sixteenths to pole and was never a factor.

Footnotes
UFFDA chased three wide into the turn, came four wide into the stretch, drew alongside MUTEKI past the eighth pole, took over with a sixteenth remaining
and drove clear. MUTEKI sped clear from inside, showed the way two wide into the stretch, roused in upper stretch, challenged by UFFDA past the eighth
pole and yielded late. WIMBERLY chased from inside, asked right handed entering the lane and finished evenly for the show honors. IRISH ROSE chased
wide up the backstretch, moved into the four path around the bend then came five wide into the stretch and could not threaten. JUDICIOUS tracked four
wide then came five wide into the lane and offered no response when needed. VERONICA'S GEM broke a step slow and lost her path, raced inside a pair
of rivals at the back into the turn, eased off the rail and came three wide into the stretch, then failed to rally when in the lane. BAD CARDINAL laid off the
pace, went two wide into the turn, came out around the bend and spun five wide into the lane before tiring in the drive.

Footnotes
BIG HAT WILLIE dueled inside a rival off the rail into the first turn then chased three wide around the bend, bid outside the top pair late on the far turn,
dueled outside RED CROSS KNIGHT in the lane and dug in to best the runner-up. RED CROSS KNIGHT broke in and bumped, went up to duel from
outside into the first turn, cleared inner rival and crossed over to the two path, headed by MACKINNON from inside on the backstretch, held a short lead
over that rival on the far turn then vied between rivals into the lane, disposed of MACKINNON then battled with BIG HAT WILLIE and got outgamed in deep
stretch. SHORTMAN got sandwiched leaving the gate, trailed two wide early, saved ground through the far turn, summoned a mild rally and gained third.
MACKINNON broke out sharply, bumped SHORTMAN and steadied at the start, chased keenly from inside then went up to duel for command, vied inside a
pair of rivals leaving the far turn, lost touch with the top pair in upper stretch and weakened. JACK SIXPACK got bumped on both sides and checked at the
start, chased three to four wide early, remained wide on the second bend, tipped out into the stretch and could not rally. RECKLESS SPIRIT chased five
wide into the clubhouse turn, angled over to the two path midway around the bend, dropped back on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and faded.
FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED MACKINNON FROM FOURTH TO FIFTH FOR BREAKING OUT SHARPLY AND CAUSING
A CHAIN REACTION BETWEEN SHORTMAN, JACK SIXPACK AND RED CROSS KNIGHT AT THE START.

Footnotes
DANCE MAN took control from inside and showed the way under pressure by a pair of rivals, tried to shake loose early on the turn but failed to do so and
had to fight with outer rivals through the turn, eased off the inside and led three wide into the lane, finally cleared with a quarter mile left to run and
maintained a comfortable advantage under urging through the final furlong. LAST CALL PAUL chased between rivals then got crowded and had to take
hold, trailed three wide into the turn, quickly angled to the inside, rallied up the fence and overtook GOLDEN RIVER for second. GOLDEN RIVER hit the
gate, went up to press between rivals, moved up on even terms around the bend still fighting between foes, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch,
chased willingly down the lane and got edged for second. FLYING BLIND bumped leaving the gate, chased between, two to three on the turn and kept on
for a minor award. WAR SWIFT bumped leaving the gate, dropped back and was taken out wide, traveled six wide into the turn, spun eight wide into the
lane and failed to offer the needed response. STEPHORTLESS hit the gate, raced in range outside rivals, rounded the turn four wide and could not rally.
FINNERS GOLDNSENSE stumbled leaving the gate, stalked off the rail then two wide into the turn, came out and entered the lane five wide, tipped out
further in the drive and weakened. REMI OR NOT attended the pace three deep, fought for command around the bend, came five wide into the lane and
weakened. CHISPA ROJA chased four deep leaving the backstretch, rounded the turn five, six, then seven wide and also weakened in the drive.
