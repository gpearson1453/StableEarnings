Footnotes
MANGIA PANE saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged y SECRET SAGA nearing the quarter pole and gradually drew clear. LAURA'S
KIDOUGH was reserved off the pace while two-wide, came three-wide into the stretch, closed strongly. SECRET SAGA prompted MANGA PANE while
two-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole but was unable to stay with that one late and finished well for third in a good effort.
WESTERBERG saved ground while being allowed to settle, slipped through during the drive and was gaining slightly late. PURE CANE SUGAR hopped
slightly at the start then was three-wide racing in the middle of the field but lacked a rally when asked. LUKA GRAZIE was off a step slow then unhurried,
came four-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. CONNECTER was forwardly placed early while three-wide and tired.

allowed to settle while racing two-wide, came three-wide into the stretch, took the lead nearing the eighth pole but was unable to resist the winner late.
SPINNIN PISTOLS was reserved off the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. WHERE YOU GONNA GO saved ground setting
the pace, drifted out slightly nearing the three-sixteenths pole then angled back in during the drive and weakened late. FREIGHTLINE settled in the middle
of the field early while racing two-wide and lacked a rally. CONRAD MEADOWS chased WHERE YOU GONNA GO early while saving ground and tired.

Footnotes
LIBBY'S GAMBIT broke in the air then rushed up along the inside to reach contention before going a quarter mile, angled out two-wide entering the stretch
then offered a bid to SENSIBLE LUTE nearing the eighth pole and wore that one down in the final strides. SENSIBLE LUTE saved ground setting the pace,
responded when challenged nearing the eighth pole and held on gamely during the drive to lose a tough decision. LADY MORMONT chased the pace while
racing two-wide and finished fairly well for third in a steady effort. ALWAYS GALLANT saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through during the drive
and went evenly late. MANY MEMORIES was forwardly placed early while three-wide and weakened. A FRIEND INDEED dropped back while saving
ground and failed to threaten. FLYING COURAGE raced in the middle of the pack for three furlongs while four-wide and gave way.
