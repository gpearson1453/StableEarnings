Footnotes
ICE BLAST was hustled along, set all the pace and widened through the stretch under mild right handed urging to win as much the best. KADESH chased
the winner and finished clear for second along the rail. RANDELLO stalked the pace three then two wide and went evenly. DON'T POKE THE CAT failed to
menace. SWEEPING GIANT allowed to settle, moved closer three wide on the far turn then came up empty. VAIL OF HONOR was outrun. THAT'S THE
WAY was no threat. BOSS BEAR was no factor.

AUSTRIAN NAVY away alertly, set a pressured pace off the rail in the four and five paths, drifted to the six path entering the stretch and drew off to win as
much the best under a strong hand ride. LOFTY COWTOWN vied for the lead three then two wide and finished second best. THINK IT THRU was forced
out bumping OUT MYY DEAR at the start, prompted the rail along the rail and was outfinished for second. ROWDY DAISY drifted out at the start, had good
early speed along the rail and faded in the stretch. MISS SHADY failed to menace. LA CUMPARSITA was no factor. SHEZ SHACKED UP was through
early. OUT MY DEAR was fractious in the gate, bumped by THINK IT THRU a few strides out of the gate, stumbled and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
FAIR AND SQUARE set the pace around the first turn, gave up the advantage near the five eighths pole, chased the runner up into the far turn, came on
again to regain control near the quarter pole then widened through the stretch under right then left handed urging to win as much the best. WICKED
WARRIOR pressed the early pace, took the lead near the five furlong pole, shook clear while under restraint, set the pace to the quarter pole then was no
match for the winner. RAVEN MOON close up along the inside, angled out on the far turn then finished with good courage in the four path. HENRY MAC
stalked the pace and went evenly. SAMMY'S SMILE failed to menace. TANTRUM was no threat. HITE was no factor.

Footnotes
GOLDEN FLAG dueled for the lead along the inside into the stretch, shook clear under right handed urging before the furlong marker and proved best under
strong handling. COUNTEVERYBLESSING unhurried early, closed fast four wide through the stretch and got up for second. SADIE'S SILVER KID allowed
to settle, finished with good courage between horses two wide. OLLIE'S FOLLY battled with the winner two wide into the stretch then was outfinished.
MAMAS HOME COOKING failed to menace. MARQUITOS M was outrun. ROLL ON BIG O had brief speed. SOCIAL HISTORY was a forward factor three
wide through the turn then stopped.
