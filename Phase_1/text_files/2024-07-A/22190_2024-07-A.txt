Footnotes
OMAHA EIGHT went after the loose leader on the turn, collared that one at the eighth pole then edged clear in the final furlong. STAY FUNNY broke alertly
and took control, was collared at the eighth pole and continued willingly. WHY STOP THERE saved ground in second flight and finished well while no threat.
JSK PHARAOH'SREIGN ducked out early, advanced wide and was no menace. BRASI eased back near half mile pole then angled out in the stretch while
outrun. END THE VIOLENCE broke very poorly and was never involved. PACIFIC STATES urged four wide off the pace and proved empty in the stretch.
JAKNAVA was urged off the pace between rivals and gave way. MAKE MINE CHROME broke sluggishly and stopped losing contact with his field.

FREEDOM EAGLE controlled the pace, shook loose after the half then eagerly pulled away under moderate pressure. ZIO SALINO chased off the leaders
inside and closed well for the place. ZIHUATANEJO raced in closest pursuit of the winner then proved empty in the stretch. TRICOLOUR trailed for half mile
then passed rivals wide while no threat. EVASIVE MOVES dropped back early and lacked a rally. IKE'S GAMBLE raced just off the pace three wide and
faltered. STARLORD lagged far behind and was never involved. CISCO KID coaxed close up for half a mile and stopped. TABLOID weakened steadily.

Footnotes
CATTY'S UNCLE set a pressured lead inside, moved clear in midstretch and stayed safe under steady handling. NORTH POLE saved ground rallying on
the turn and continued willingly. JEWELS IN THE BAY raced wide just off the leaders then flattened out in the stretch. CAPO lacked speed, shifted wide on
the turn and finished full of run wide. AFRAIDOFTHEBUNNY prompted the pace between rivals and proved empty in the stretch. BURN THE EVIDENCE
pressed the winner outside for half mile and gave way. JESTER'S SONG broke a bit awkwardly, moved up between rivals and faltered.

PURE LURE broke slowest, forced the pace outside then edged away through the final furlong while kept to a drive. THEGODDESSOFSNAKES urged to
the front inside, was collared on the final turn, resisted and continued gamely to the finish. TRUE PHENOMENON settled inside pacesetters within striking
range to the lane and tired. SO FULLY SUE was rated off the pace outside and weakened steadily. TWIST HER settled off the pace in the two path then
stopped abruptly.

BOOM BOOM KABOOM quickly moved clear, widened to midstretch and lasted tiring late. NAVY RULES pursued the winner throughout and made a
gradual late gain. SUENO PROFUNDO (ARG) lacked speed, angled out in the stretch and closed well. FOOD FOODIE dropped far behind then narrowed
the gap inside. MR. TUTTLE outrun early, lacked any serious response. BLUEY trailed for half a mile then made up ground late. FINANCIAL STRENGTH
raced wide off the pace, moved very wide on the turn and weakened. TOUGH WORKOUT flashed speed in the opening quarter then gave way readily.
JAY'S DELIGHT was urged off the leaders in the two path and stopped.

through the stretch. VINE JET settled behind the pacesetters, bid after half a mile then flattened out. SPEIGHTSTER RED chased within range three wide,
made a brief bid on the final turn then faltered. TEEWINOT PASS trailed for half mile then passed rivals inside. MY REDEMPTION dropped back outside
and was never in contention. YES SIR COLONEL raced far behind and failed to respond. CENTURION pressed the winner for half mile then stopped
abruptly.

THE ANGRY MAN far behind early, rallied inside, finished with a rush and was up in the late stages. JACOHARE dueled outside, shook loose into the
stretch and continued gamely but was nailed late. AHSAD settled close up, bid wide on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. HENRYTHETHIRD
dropped back inside then closed mildly through the stretch. SEA TRIDENT dueled along the rail to the stretch and weakened. INDOCTRINATE lacked
speed, drifted very wide on the turn and was no factor. RELISHMENT trailed for half mile then caught fading rivals. ELVIRUS chased within range briefly
then gave way readily. RUDY ROD raced in midpack then began retreating on the turn.
