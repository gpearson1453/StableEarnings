Footnotes
BIRDIE BE GONE raced off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole, gained ground and got up for
the win late. BECAUSE led the way on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the bend and dug in the lane, getting caught in late stretch.
MORGS WORLD trailed the field through the opening quarter, came around the turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and improved
position in the lane. ANN ALEE stalked the pace setters on the outside early, navigated the bend from the three path and kept on to the wire. MANHATTAN
CHERRY pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and weakened in the stretch. COCKTAIL
SLIPPERS tracked the leader between horses through the early going, came around the turn in the two path and faded in the lane.
