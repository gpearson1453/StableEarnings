Footnotes
CALI CRUISER allowed to settle, closed willingly four wide through upper stretch to make the lead at the furlong marker and edged clear under strong
handling. MIESHA was bumped at the start, stalked the early pace, loomed boldly three wide nearing the furlong marker and finished second best.
COUNTESS COLETTE trailed early and found her best stride late. SALTMAKESHERSWEET pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch, made the
lead on the turn, set the pace until mid stretch then was outfinished. OFFLEE TRICKY was bumped at the start, set a pressured pace along the inside into
the turn then weakened. THE KID'S PRAYER also bumped at the start, was no threat. MAYBETHEONE was fractious in the gate, hit the gate at the start
and had brief speed. WINDY VALLEY bore in badly causing a chain reaction of bumping to her inside then was through early.

Footnotes
CUE THE BAND stalked the pace three wide through the turn, rallied to make the lead at the top of the stretch, drifted to the seven path and finished full of
run to win as much the best. LADY FORTUNE pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch, made the lead past the three furlong marker, set the pace
to the top of the stretch then was no match for the winner. TRULY INCLUSIVE reared at the start, trailed far back, swung wide, swerved through the stretch
and closed a gap late in the middle of the racetrack. TWENTY FOUR KARAT rushed to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the turn,
remained a sharp threat into the stretch then gave way. HITCH CITY was through after a half. BAY MAGIC had brief speed, stopped, was eased to the wire
and walked off.

leader past the half mile pole, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished. OAKEN well placed, failed to respond. GOLDEN MONEY failed to

Footnotes
KELLEHER allowed to settle, closed rapidly inside rivals through the turn, altered course three wide entering the stretch, responded with a burst of speed
under left handed urging and won as much the best. WOLFINE pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, drifted to the six path giving up ground and
position then dug in gamely late and gained second. LEROYISALAGNIAPPE never far back, finished determinedly five wide. ROLL A QUARTERS rushed
to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch then was outfinished. HARTSTEIN hopped at the start, offered a mild bid along the
inside into the stretch then leveled off. CAVALETTO had good early speed then faded. A PRAYER FOR KIDS was no threat. COLOR BEARER had brief
speed.
