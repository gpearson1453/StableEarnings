Footnotes
ICONIC LEGACY quickly moved clear, repelled a rival at the quarter pole and drew away under moderate pressure. OSPREY prompted the pace along the
inside and finished willingly. DATHOSS urged close up in the two path then flattened out in the stretch. LUCKY DUDE broke slowest then narrowed gap
along the inside. THE BEARRISH ONE chased off the leaders outside and lacked a rally. DADASHEV moved briefly closer on the turn then came up empty.
DISCO DEVIL lacked speed and was never in contention. AHSAD raced within striking range early then stopped abruptly. MIZZEN MAN dropped back early
and trailed throughout.
