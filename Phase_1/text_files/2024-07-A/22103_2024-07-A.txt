MAGGIE'S GIRL rated a slim lead inside, dug in to the challenge of Lightnin Runner leaving the three eighths pole, put that one away passing the five
sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn and held off JUBA'S PARADE with steady handling. The latter saved ground well off the early pace, crept closer
through the backstretch and bid approaching the quarter pole, raced in range of the lead off the rail on the far turn and finished well at the outside withers of
the winner. MOONLIT SHADOW settled off the rail the opening turn, moved to the outside into the backstretch and gave chase from the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn four wide and came along for third late yards. LUCYLOU WHO settled off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and
raced close at the rail on the far turn, but flattened in the stretch. LIGHTNIN RUNNER stalked two deep on the first turn, moved to challenge the winner at
the three eighths pole, but dropped back at the five sixteenths and faded in the three path on the far turn.

the seven sixteenths, gave up the lead toward the quarter pole and faded at the rail on the far turn. NICO LUCKY saved ground. TAPADINE rounded the
opening turn about the three path and never factored. THE ICE MAN CARLOS stalked two deep and raced at even terms from the nine sixteenths pole,
