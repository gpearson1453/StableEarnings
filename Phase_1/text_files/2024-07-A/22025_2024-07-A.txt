CHATALAS was clear early, dueled inside through the stretch and was in time under steady urging. LITTLE JAMIE pressed the pace outside of the winner,
dueled in through the stretch and was outfinished. IMPEL stalked in the three path and bid bid belatedly. BAND OF GOLD was off slowly, raced inside, bid
at the half-mile pole, lacked room at the three-sixteenth pole, angled three wide for room and closed. NEON ICON was off awkwardly, stalked the pace in
the two path, bid between foes at the five-eighths pole couldn't sustain the bid. DANCING PRINCESS raced well back.
