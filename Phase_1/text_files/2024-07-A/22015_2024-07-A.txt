sixteenths pole, was in the two path into the lane, inched clear near the eighth pole but yielded late and held place in the final stages. COOL RAGS tracked
the pace early on, raced in the four path into the lane while making a bid, continued with a bid down the lane but did not have enough for place in the late

FLIP FLOPS was bumped going into the first turn, raced in the three path along the turn while back early on, was in the five path entering the lane, swept
past and took over command near the eighth pole and drew clear in the final stages. DERRY GIRL broke a tad slow at the start, raced along the inside in
both turns, came up the rail down the lane while making a bid and held place in the final stages. LOVE TEMPO (IRE) broke a tad slow at the start and raced
back early on, swung into the six path entering the lane, rallied down the lane and just missed place in the final stages. ALWAYS PRACTICAL stalked the
dueling leaders early on, took over command near the five sixteenths pole, led the field into the lane but weakened late in the stretch run. CHATTANOOGA
CREW chased the pace early on, raced in the four path into the lane while making a bid but weakened late in the stretch drive. ALONGCOMESAWOMAN
was steadied along the inside into the first turn, raced in the five path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch. GHOSTTAPPER raced two wide
along the first turn, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but leveled off late in the drive. TAKE NOTE OF THIS raced along the
inside in the first turn, chased the early pace, was in the four path into the lane and faded late in the stretch. GROVE CITY SUNSET broke slowly at the start
and was never a factor. MATCH FIVE broke out at the start, set the pace early on, was in the two path into the lane and gave way down the lane.
