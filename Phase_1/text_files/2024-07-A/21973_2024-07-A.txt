Footnotes
LUCCA'S LEGACY hustled to the front, set all the pace from the rail then responded in the stretch to hold. SMOKENSILVER chased the winner throughout
while two wide but could not make an impact in the drive. SENSATIONAL CITY had no speed, was off the rail on both turns and lacked the needed late
response. LONGFORD bobbled slightly to begin, chased the top two from the rail to the stretch and also did not rally. SAINT HELEN stalked the leaders
three wide but came up empty in the drive.

TAVERNELLE never far back, surged to the front nearing the second turn then drew clear without need of urging. MR MAKUNOUCHI broke inward,
bumped HOPS FOR POPS, had no speed, made a run inside and was along late for the place. JEWELED AGAIN tracked the pace while two wide then was
outkicked on the second turn and did not rally. IKE BUTTE had no speed and was never a threat. TREASURE MESA got outsprinted while three wide and
weakened in the final furlong. LIL BIT OF HEAVEN was hustled to the front, set the pace for three furlongs then was outkicked by the winner and gave way.
HOPS FOR POPS was bumped at the start, pressed to mid backstretch then was giving way and had the rider lose his irons.

Footnotes
CHIEFS LIL PEARL dueled for the lead from the outset, inched away on the second turn, was clear into the stretch then had to dig in gamely to hold.
MIDNIGHT SYMPHONY lagged for three eighths, advanced inside then eased off the rail into the stretch and finished full of run. SPANISH CHANNEL
tracked the pace to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch then finished willingly and just missed second. HERE'S THE THING had no speed, was
three wide throughout and lacked the needed late response. HYPHY disputed the pace outside the winner and two wide but tired after a half mile. SOFIA
STRONG was chasing the leaders for three furlongs then tired.
