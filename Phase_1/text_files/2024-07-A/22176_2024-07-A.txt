up to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, quickly took on the outside challenge of KHOZANTHEDESTROYER entering the head of the lane, vied for
the lead into the final furlong, fought back from the inside but could not move on with the winner late. IRISH COAST led the way around the first turn and set
the pace up the backstretch, took on the challenge of OUR HEAVENLY GIFT at the quarter pole then the added challenge of the eventual winner turning for

KINGSWOOD vied three deep for the lead up the backstretch, shook free late on the turn and drew off down the lane while ridden out. SISAWAY NOW
tracked the top trio up then backstretch, chased three to four wide around the turn, was no match for pulling away winner but dug in gamely to capture
place. GRAND DESIGN vied inside a duo up the backstretch, battled on into the turn, could not match strides past the quarter pole, ran on into the lane and
got edged for place. HULEN dueled between rivals for the early lead, battled on into the turn then failed to match past the quarter pole, kept on into the lane
and got edged late for runner up spots. CHARMING CHARLIE raced in the back, was urged two to three wide into the upper stretch and lacked a needed
rally. LEATHERNECK raced off the early pace, urged along the rail around the turn but had no response.

Footnotes
ESPRIT ROUGE stalked the leader around the first turn and up the backstretch, hustled along three wide entering the far turn, sustained bid into the lane,
reached the leader in the final furlong, dug in under firm handling, edged by and held firm. STUMPY'S LOVE SONG sped to the lead at the start and held a
slim lead around the first turn, widened advantage and set the pace by a clear margin up the backstretch, held firm over oncoming rivals late on the far turn,
fought on gamely into the final furlong, lost the edge to ESPRIT ROUGE deep stretch and had to settle for second best. ORPHAN SANDY tracked the clear
leader up the backstretch, edged closer two wide late on the far turn, sustained bid through the lane and cleared the rest. EDGY LOVER raced near
midpack while saving ground through early stages, hustled along two wide around the far turn, tipped wider for the drive and had no late kick. CAN'T BE
CAUGHT raced off the early pace, edged closer racing three wide around the far turn then weakened in the lane. COUNTY JAIL settled off the early pace,
rode the rail around the final turn, shifted out in upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. TACTICAL REBEL rated off the pace, hustled along two wide
around the final turn and never threatened.
