Footnotes
FORTUITY unhurried in the early going to be near the back of the field, steadily gained ground into the far turn rallying up the fence, angled well wide at the
head of the lane to engage the pacesetters in mid-stretch and pulled away as much the best. VENN prompted the pace for the first half mile, dueled with the
leader to upper stretch briefly taking the lead, was outfinished by the winner and kept-on well to be second best. BELLO CREEDO set a pressured pace
from the rail the entire way and was outkicked in the final eighth when weakening. GUITAR BOY tracked the leaders down the backside from two wide,,
remained two wide allowing the winner to slip through on the fence on the far turn and failed to gain ground when called upon. DECCAN PRINCE (IRE)
stalked the pace from three wide and lacked a clossing response. MONAASIB failed to menace posing no threat. JOLLY TOMMY raced in contention from
four wide down the backside and faded. MOTAWAAFEQ was outrun.

Footnotes
THE PRETTY SISTER moved up the inside to set the pace shortly away from the gate, opened a clear advantage on the turn and finished gamely repeling
all challengers in the stretch. FAYE L. stalked the pace through the turn, rallied from four wide in the lane to be slowly cutting into the winners advantage
through the lane. ARTIE'S DEAL tracked the leaders to upper stretch and rallied belatedly inside the eighth pole. GEMMY broke sharply to the lead, was
taken in hand to settle just off the pacesetter down the backside, rallied to loom in upper stretch and failed to sustain the bid. EVE EVE was not a factor.
RANOLOGY was very reluctant to load and showed little being outrun. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
MISS LONELYHEARTS rated off the leaders for the first half mile, rallied four wide to take control turning for home and drew off convincingly. NO COST
reserved off the pace to midway on the far turn, rallied from six wide turning for home, angled in midway down the lane and finished willingly.
REQUESTFORPROPOSAL stalked the pace to the far turn, made a threatening bid in upper stretch and failed to sustain the rally. ROSIE SPRIT prompted
the pace for five-eighths and weakened coming home. BELLAMYSAWESOMEDAY set a pressured pace for three-quarters and tired in the stretch. CAT B
CAUSE went one-paced posing no threat. STARSHIP NOLA was leaning back as the gates opened causing him to rear slightly aand be off slowly and was
never a factor after that.

TOTALLY ADDICTED unhurried early to be near the rear of the field, rallied five wide, dueled through the lane, exchanging the lead with the runner-up and
was the beneficiary of the head bob on the wire. IT'S A BIRD reserved off the pace down the backside, came under an early ride to commence a rlly on the
far turn, engaged the leaders in mid-stretch, took the lead inside the eighth pole, surendered the lead to the winner in the final yards and surged again to just
miss. DEAL WITH HIM reserved off the pace for a half mile, cut the corner turning for home to take a brief lead midway down the lane and was outfinished
in a good try. QUARTER RAT pressed the pace to the top of the lane and kept-on evenly down the stretch. TSURIS trailed to midway on the turn, circled
eight wide and rallied mildly in the lane. INSPECTOR ED stalked the pace to the head of the stretch and flattened out. SABER RUN was not a threat.
KAHAAL set the pace under pressure for a half and gave way. SWIFT N TRAFFIC contended early and faded on the turn.

NOPENOTTONIGHT raced near the pace from four wide in the first turn, was rated off the leaders down the backside, waited patiently on the bend, split
rivals nearing the quarter pole, angled five wide at the top of the lane and mounted a good closing rally to be up in the final stride. TDZSHININLUCKYSTAR
settled off the pace to race near the rear of the field early, rallied four wide down the backside into contention, took command in upper stretch and was
nailed on the wire. MACHO BEANIE stalked the early pace in the first turn, lost position entering the far turn and made a milfd bid in the lane. FREDDIE BY
A NOSE slow early to be the trailer to the top of the stretch and made a non-threatening grindig rally past tiring rivals in the lane. ORLEANS TOURIST set
the pace on a well measured lead and lacked a response when challenged turning for home. THROWIN' SHADE tracked the leaders down the backside,
made a bid at the three-eighths pole and gave way on the bend.

Footnotes
HAPPY SEASON stalked the pacesetter from four wide through the turn, engaged the leader turning for home, dueled through the lane and prevailed in
deep stretch. FLASHIN CHIP sped top the lead fro mthe gate to open a clear lead to the turn, responded when challenged at the quarter pole, battled to
deep stretch and was outkicked late in the drive in a game effort. WE CALL HIM DOC tracked the leaders the entire trip and failed to gain ground while
holding the show. WILD APRIORITY broke a step slow from the gate, was forced well wide by inside rival withinn the first strides and made a steady gain
attempting to overcome the disastrous start. MUNCLE went evenly without impact. MY DAD'S GUITAR raced at the back of the main body of the field and
passed weaker in the lane. LACEY'S KAT pressed the pace early and steadily gave way. WAY TOO TOUGH broke outward when pushed by inside rival
filling the open space left by the outside rivals slow break, continued to be wide throughout and was not persevered with.
