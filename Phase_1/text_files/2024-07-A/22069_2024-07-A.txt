Footnotes
PETROLO In hand four wide, let out a notch on the last turn, challenged three across, kicked loose when roused and was ridden out. ENGLISH STORM
Saved ground, checked midway on the first turn, continued along the rail, eased out and was along for the place. FREE FOLK Away on top, vied along the
two around the turns, battled the winner to no avail and then just missed the place. SOLO TONIGHT Appeared fractious just as the gates opened, broke
slow, lagged back, angled wide and was going well at the end. KING KHALI Forced the issue along the three path around the turns and faded. AMERICAN
