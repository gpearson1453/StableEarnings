Footnotes
WOODHULL broke outwardly and brushed foe, then established the pace from the inside, was overtaken by an outer foe heading into the far turn, stalked
while in a steady hand ride, came out two wide to spar with stable down the lane then found more to draw clear in the final yards. CIRCA STAR was
brushed at the start, tracked the pace along the rail in the early stages, inched up on the far turn under robust urging to go shoulder with stable mate down
the late stretch and was out finished. MI SONRISA pressed the pace from the two path early, then moved up down the backstretch to gain command on the
far turn, was met with outer foes in the upper stretch to battle down the lane then gave way. CACTUS BLOSSOM was no threat. ARR PIRATETREASURE
was no menace. QUEEN OF SALSA trailed early and passed tired foe in the stretch. CAYMAN HOT tracked the pace while two wide in the early furlongs
then faded on the far turn and failed to rally.

JACKMAN'S RIDE was away well to show the way from the inside, drew clear in the stretch and lasted to the wire. AVAILABLE STAR raced from the inside
mid pack, then came out three wide leaving the bend, rallied a bid to pass up rivals, gain second position and was gaining on the leader. PRINCE
LANCELOT (GB) pursued the pace while racing two wide mid pack, then fanned out four wide leaving the turn to rally a gamely bid and get up for the show
prize besting the rest. BRUCELEA was allowed to settle in the back trio along the rail, then rallied bid in the upper stretch but it was too little too late.
DEAN'S LIST chased the pace while two wide, gain second position leaving the bend and lacked the needed response in the stretch and gave way. SIGN
OF WAR broke outwardly and chased the pace from the inside, then rallied a mild bid in the upper stretch but it was not enough and gave way. STAYED IN
FOR HALF lunged at the start and was no rally. MORELLO was impeded at the start and failed to rally.

Footnotes
RAGS ROYAL PRINZ led the way from the inside while in a steady hand ride early, then drew off in the stretch and held on well to prevail. BERGHEIM
chased the pace while three wide and between rivals, came under coaxing leaving the bend, dug in gamely in the upper stretch to gain second position but
did not have enough to catch the leader. GOLDEN GRIT bumped inner foe at the start, then was forced inwards by an outer foe, was unhurried early,
moved up while six wide on the turn, rallied bid in the upper stretch and was able to get up for the show winnings. PROUD SAMARITAN was forced
outwardly by an inner foe then carried inwardly by another, trailed at the back early, then circled five wide leaving the bend to rally a bid in the early stretch,
lugged in then kept on coming up empty. BETTER EDGE broke outwardly at the start, chased while four wide down the backstretch, dropped back heading
into the turn, moved out to the four path leaving the turn, steadied avoiding outer foe then kept on down the lane to no avail. HEATS HERO chased the pace
while two deep, was urging on the turn then lacked rallying in the stretch. KING ADOLIS was impeded at the start and was no menace. MR. BOOP
prompted the pace while two wide, bid on the turn while in second position on the turn, could not catch the leader and gave way. CANYON STREAK chased
from the inside mid pack and in a hard drive, was used up after the turn and tired. EAGLE IN THE AIR veered inwardly impeding rivals, stalked the pace
briefly while three wide, then flattened out after the turn.

Footnotes
JUST CHILLIN led the way briefly before being over taken by an outer foe, continued to stalk from the inside while being well rated, then found more in the
late stretch to edge past ATRAS in the final yards and prevail. ATRAS emerged from the pack to take command heading into the turn, was in an all out drive
in the late stretch then was out finished by an outer foe in the final yards and was second best. CLEAT was brushed by inner foe, then pursued the pace
while four wide, came under a gamely bid leaving the bend to gain third position, could not catch the leading pair and was best for the show prize. BELEWS
GOLD broke outwardly and brushed foe, was allowed to settle in the back trio, saved ground throughout the turn, came out four wide and rallied in the
stretch but it was too little too late. SUPER BRADY chased the pace while two wide, then rallied a mild bid in the upper stretch but it was to no avail. CLAY'S
BLACK OPAL broke outwardly, then chased the pace between foes, dropped back along the rail on the turn, bid in the upper stretch and came up empty.
WODETON (FR) was cut off at the start, then trailed early, rallied in the late stretch and never threatened. SATURDAY'S GOLD chased the pace from the
inside at a moderate pace and needed rally in the final furlongs. HARD CANDY was no menace. LET'S GO ALAMO bid briefly for the lead before settling
back to chase the pace while five wide, then lacked rally after the turn.

Footnotes

path to moved up on the far turn, rallied a gamely bid at the top of the stretch, met with QUARTERBACK BAK in the final sixteenth but could not overpower
the determined leader and hung at the wire. TAKE FLIGHT led the way from the inside, sparred with an outer foe in the late backstretch, stalked the

far turn then lacked the needed response in the late stretch. GOLD ACCOUNT tracked the pace from the inside, then rallied bid leaving the far turn while

Footnotes
INTERSTELLAR showed the way from the inside, then held sway to prevail gate to wire. DON'TASK DON'TTELL saved ground in the early stages,
remained well rated throughout the far turn, dug in gamely in the upper stretch then closed well down the late and hung at the wire. BIZZEE CHANNEL
raced from the inside mid pack, then rallied bid leaving the far turn to gain second position in the upper stretch, could not catch the leader then was out
finished for the place prize. BROCK ON BY was off slowly, was allowed to settle while two wide towards the back, then rallied leaving the far bend while
passing foes but it was too late to make a difference. COTTONWOOD tracked the pace from the inside, was in a long drive leaving the far turn, lacked the
sparking bid and gave way. RODEO CHAMP was no rally. MIAMI MOONLIGHT was no menace. MOR LANA SPIRIT was no rally.
