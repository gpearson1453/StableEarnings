from ALBERTA, came together with ALBERTA at the three sixteenth pole, battled inside while leaning heavily on the outside foe, then the rider made
contact in the final strides bumping into ALBERTA. ALBERTA reserved off the early pace while three wide, came together with OOPS, then was carried
wide through the stretch under a hard long drive then was bumped off stride late stretch. PARZANNI attended the pace from the rail, stalked the leader
heading into the far turn, and faded gradually. RUN MYA RUN prompted the pace while two wide, and tired early. ISLA VIEW allowed to settle, and showed
little. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards inquired in the late stretch of the raced. After a review of the film, it was determined that the rider of OPPS made

SILENT COUNT hurried away, angled down to the rail in the first turn, showed the way in the two path, responded to challengers nearing the quarter pole,
and held safely late. OUR SUNSHINE stalked the early pace while three wide, moved up alongside SILENT COUNT to challenge the front, but was unable
to sustain the bid that was needed and flattened out. PASSAGE fanned four wide in the first turn, was five wide through the backstretch, rallied four wide at
the head of the lane, faded through the stretch. COUNTY WINDS tracked four wide, and faded with two furlongs remaining. HARRY'S A HOTTIE saved
inside, and tired early.

NO MORE JO KING angled inside to the four path, rallied four wide into the stretch, and won driving. DRAMATIC FLAIR vied four wide, was asked to
quicken in the final turn, gained a slim advantage nearing the stretch, and was outfinished. PERPETUAL BLISS bumped leaving, and rallied belatedly to
earn show. SHAKEITFORMEGIRL gapped early, gained closer order nearing the quarter pole, and showed interest late. LUCKY HALO bumped away from
the gate, then hurried to the front, was overtaken nearing the stretch, and had nothing left in reserve late. GOLDIE SOCKS stalked pace from rail, and gave
way late stretch.

attended the pace while four wide, rallied three wide into the stretch, and inched up to secure a second place finish. LITTLE HARPER contended the pace
from the rail, rallied inside through stretch and was bested for place. ADDYDIDIT was gapped leaving the backstretch, and offered a late mild bid. HENRY'S
GAMBLE contested the pace between foes, fought on through the stretch and gave way grudgingly.

Footnotes
ISLE OF SKYE vied for the early lead, gained a short advantage at the head of the lane, and held under a late drive. TIGERITO stalked the pacesetters
while three wide, closed gamely through stretch and missed. SHORTY THE SWEDE pressed the pace from the two path, was unable to move on with rival,
and yielded. MONEY MUNCHER raced wide early, and rallied belatedly. BRATTON tracked four to five wide, and weakened late stretch. PUMP THE
BRAKES sat in striking distance while five wide, chased inside, and faded. DUNE D'ORO never involved.
