Footnotes
CAIRO CAPER was content to watch the lone speed down the backside, moved closer when nudged for more five sixteenths from home, bid for the lead
outside in upper stretch, took over at the furlong marker and edged away late for the score. KOKOMO seized command from the start, comfortably took this
field around the turn, was headed outside by the winner at the top of the stretch, fought on until the eighth pole before giving way and still finished up solidly
to best others when crossing the finish line in second. MONTEREY BAY settled three deep in midfield down the back straight, shifted to the fence taking the
shortest way around the turn, angled out to the four path straightening for home and willingly finished up to capture third money right at the finish line.
DEWOLF travelled on the fence in the third flight in the early going, was in range of the dueling leaders at the top of the lane, sitting just behind on the
fence, shifted outside for a clear run at the furlong marker but faded late losing the show award at the wire. SHIFTY was off slowly to trail from the start,
continued to see the field around the bend, swung out gathering momentum widest in the six path turning for home and finished with interest to be involved
for the minors at the finish line. CONACHER was ahead of only the poor starter along the backside, saved ground, but made little headway throughout the
turn and had little to show down the lane running on the fence. ISAAC LEO was situated outside runners in the third flight down the backside, was asked for
more three furlongs out, offered little response, was floated five wide at the top of the stretch and came up empty in the drive to the wire.

Footnotes
UMNEYAAT stalked in the third flight between runners in the first turn, rated kindly settling into stride down the backstretch still in the third tier, angled out
inching closer three wide by the quarter pole, continued to gain in the five path straightening out for the drive and when urged at the furlong marker drew
away for the victory. OLD SECRETS broke out, bumping foe on the start, settled in midfield on the rail in the first bend, advanced closer on the fence
through the backstretch, kept pace on the rail in the final turn, shifted three wide between foes to be in the mix turning for home, was no match for the
winner late but stayed on for the runners up share at the wire. SWEET SERENADE stalked near the rear three wide on the first turn, was headstrong with
rivals on both sides entering the backstretch, burst between horses smartly commencing a run three furlongs from the line, shifted out six wide at the top of
the stretch, was reaching for more ground down the lane to close in and capture the show money. HOT OMELET assumed the lead in the first turn, dictated
terms up front with only mild pressure along the backstretch, was clinging onto the lead travelling on the rail at the eighth pole and gave way inside to settle
for a minor share in the end. ENDORPHIN RUSH was nestled on the rail behind the leader in the early stages, closed the gap to be in the hint on the fence
at the top of the lane but lacked a bid in the stretch and faded on the rail at the furlong marker. DELPHIA prompted the pace outside in the initial bend, was
content to sit just behind the frontrunner down the back straight, was hard ridden chasing the leader in the far turn, could not find more in the four path
turning for home and weakened between rivals through the stretch. THUNDERHEAVYRAIN stalked close to the back five wide entering the first turn, status
was unchanged three deep along the backside, made little progression three wide on the final bend outside foes and had little to offer driving to the line.
ABSOLUTE JEWEL travelled in mid-pack three wide in the first turn, lost ground while keeping position down the back straight, was urged for more with
three eighths remaining but was being passed by rivals, shifted four wide in the stretch and failed to menace down the lane. SERENADING HALL broke in,
bumping inside foe to start, trailed the field in the early stages, could not get interested on the final turn and passed a tired one in the stretch drive. STOLE
THE RING settled near the rear on the rail in the beginning, improved mildly down the backside on the fence, was scrubbed on for more three eighths out,
had little to give and wilted inside at the furlong pole.

Footnotes
MAKE NO MISTAKE was tucked in under a snug hold on the rail in mid-division behind the pacesetter, waited for her cue on the fence around the turn,
shifted outside, two wide at the quarter pole, was in full flight in the three path straightening out for the drive, was urged left handed with an eighth to go and
pulled away late to best all rivals at the wire. ONANDONANDON was content to sit just off the frontrunner along the backside, moved to the lead outside
with five sixteenths to run, determinedly fought down the lane but could not fend off the surging winner in the final furlong. BUTTERED TOAST was four
deep outside foes near the back down the back straight, made a move circling three wide around horses throughout the turn, loomed a threat in the four
path at the top of the stretch, could not sustain the rally and finished up a non threatening third at the finish line. ENGLISH BISCUIT travelled between rivals
in mid-pack down the backstretch, was asked right-handed but could not quicken with horses making a move in midturn and finished up mildly in the three
path to settle on the fringes in the end. EMERALD LAKE to command after the break, was collared outside by the quarter pole, offered little resistance
inside and retreated on the fence at the furlong marker. TEXT ME UP was unhurried down the backstretch to trail in the beginning, continued to be
uninterested, seeing the field around the bend and could not get involved driving to the finish line.

Footnotes
TURF AND SURF was reserved toward the back in the early going saving ground inside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, angled out four wide past
the quarter pole seeking room, came out a bit further in upper stretch and under urging outside the furlong grounds, struck the lead by the sixteenth pole
and drove clear. NOW YOU SEE ME was shuffled back just after the start, settled at the back outside four wide, advanced on the far turn in behind runners,
waited briefly at the quarter pole but found room soon after, rallied well but was only second best. FOREVER DANISH quickly moved clear to set the pace
inside, was still clear leading them into upper stretch, weakened inside the final furlong and was collared by the sixteenth pole, kept on well enough to just
save show honors. ORIGINAL ME tracked from inside, came out for the drive, kept on in the stretch but missed show. FOREST VIXEN exchanged a light
bump after the start, was mid-pack racing off the inside about three deep into and on the first turn, was forced out five wide leaving the far turn, ran on.
CONTAGIOUSLAUGHTER exchanged a light bump after the start, settled at the back racing just off the inside, was one-paced. ASHWICKEN was outside
mid-pack five wide, floated eight deep turning for home, was never a threat. BLONDE DYNAMO was four wide and about mid-pack stalking, ridden along
three furlongs out, failed to menace. HAYEK chased from outside two to three wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
AFRICAN SAFARI broke inwards bumping the inside rival on the start, quickly recovered with an impressive early turn of foot to clear to the rail for the lead
five furlongs from the finish line, comfortably set the pace around the bend, found more in reserve when encouraged left-handed in upper stretch and
widened the margin to the finish line with a dominant display. SAUCY NAME broke sharp for the early lead, was then relegated to watch to frontrunning
winner by the five eighths marker, moved in to bid just outside with five sixteenths from the wire, was no match for the overpowering winner in the stretch but
valiantly stayed on to hold for the runners up share at the wire. GO GIFFEN was shuffled back some down the backstretch to travel in mid-pack, waited
patiently on the fence through the turn, commenced a run inside five sixteenths out, shifted out to the three path finding a seam in upper stretch and closed
in late to capture the show award. PRINCESSONAMISSION was situated near the back three deep outside rivals along the backside, closed the gap
rallying through runners in the two path around the turn, posed a threat four wide in upper stretch but stalled with a sixteenth remaining for a minor role.
GOOD NEWS MONEY settled near the rear between foes in the two path down the back straight, made little impression around the bend, lacked running
room behind horses at the top of the lane and finished with purpose in deep stretch extending her stride smartly. ZEENA SWIFT travelled on the rail in the
third tier with five furlongs remaining, settled on the rail behind the engaged duo with three eighths to run, was in range for a piece of the prize inside turning
for home but evened out on the fence down the lane. SPECTACULAR FORCE settled outside foes in midfield four deep down the backstretch and through
the turn, shifted inwards to the two path with five sixteenths to go, angled back out to the four path for the drive to the wire with runners on both sides but
could not reach contention through the stretch. UNHEARD stalked three deep outside rivals five furlongs from home, kept pace with the leaders travelling
four wide around the bend, had a chance for a share of the prize five wide at the quarter pole, could not find more down the lane and faltered at the furlong
pole. NOYZEE GIRL was bumped on the break to trail down the backside, made no headway throughout the turn and passed weary ones in the final
furlong. PLAYFULLY FRAC'IN was checked on the rail throughout the backstretch, shifted out three wide at the half to offer a mild run on the turn but could
not get involved in the run down the stretch. L'ESPRIT settled between horses in the third flight, five eighths from home, was in the mix when ridden for
more between horses when just behind the leaders at the three furlong marker, could not accelerate with others entering the stretch and folded by the
quarter pole.

Footnotes
DUCHESS QUEEN broke a step slowly and lost the path just after the start, settled well back racing last but one and off the inside, came out seven wide in
upper stretch, put forth a very fast rally to surge past late. SHOOTIN' AMY stalked from outside racing two to three wide, was forced out wider in upper
stretch, bumped lightly approaching the eighth pole, led by the sixteenth pole but was just outfinished. CHIPOTLE PEPPER broke outwardly but quickly took
command, set the pace inside on or just off the rail, was challenged near the quarter pole, turned back that foe in upper stretch and lugged out a bit, was
overtaken by further rivals in late stretch but kept on well to hold show honors. PRAIRIE SKY tracked from inside the second group, came out in upper
stretch seeking room but found none, bumped with a rival and altered back in a bit, ran on. OUR STELLA was outside a rival off the pace two to three wide
and went evenly. FEATHERWEIGHT stalked the pacesetter from close range, drew even at the quarter pole bidding for the lead, faltered in the stretch.
FULCRA was in a bit tight along the rail early up the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, was never a threat. J M R SWEET ESME broke a step slowly,
was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
ZODIAC BEACH shadowed the frontrunner outside down the backstretch, pounced to the lead outside, two wide at the quarter pole, dueled to the eighth
pole, put away the rival to open up with a sixteenth remaining and just hung on from the surging favorite to prevail in a photo at the finish line. GHOSTLY
PERFECTION was unhurried to trail at the beginning, inched closer on the rail through the turn, was then stuck behind a retreating rival on the fence at the
quarter pole, had clear run when shifting out to the three path at the furlong marker, closed with a rush, flying late, to just miss the nod at the wire for the
win. SHE'SACROWDPLEASER broke outwards on the start, was in front of the field leaving the chute, continued to set the pace along the backside, was
collared outside at the quarter pole by the winner, could not find more in the stretch and faded with a sixteenth to run, holding for third money. TEXENSIS
was forced out between foes on the start, settled in the third tier with horses on both sides down the back straight, emerged from the pack with five
sixteenths to run, chasing the engaged duo around the bend and finished up willingly for a minor share in the end. SPEED LOADER had a poor start to
co-trail between foes midway down the backside, lost position when in tight surroundings, stuck behind a tiring horse in midturn, could see the field at the
quarter pole, angled out five wide for the drive, shifted inwards to the two path at the eighth pole and had a good turn of foot late running on end at the wire.
LOOKHOWPRETTY was under a tight rein stalking near the rear in the backstretch, closed the gap when asked three furlongs from the finish, was in the
hunt five wide turning for home but finished up one paced down the lane. SILVER LASSO travelled four deep in midfield along the backside, offered a mild
run four wide outside runners on the turn, could not find another gear in the stretch and weakened at the furlong marker. SAKE AND SUSHI co-trailed while
four deep in mid-backstretch, offered a good rally three furlongs from the wire, was floated out to the six path in upper stretch, could not sustain the long
drive and yielded at the sixteenth pole. VIRGINIA'S LEGACY stalked inside foes at the half in the two path, was throttled down under restraint seven
sixteenths from home, lost positioning when backing through the field around the bend and was not a factor in the stretch running. STANDING STRONG
improved on the rail down the backside to track behind the leader at the half, came under a ride, going the wrong way on the fence by midturn and flattened
out on the rail in upper stretch.

LOOKS LUCKY TO ME had a good early position from the outside post, watching the top two into the first turn, tracked three wide outside down the
backstretch, moved in to bid for the lead midpoint on the final turn, dueled tenaciously outside in the stretch and began to edge away at the sixteenth pole to
hold for the win. IRON PRINCESS settled on the rail in mid-pack for the early parts of the race, rallied, bursting between horses in the two path at the
quarter pole, shifted to the three path gaining momentum turning for home and was closing in quick on the leader in deep stretch but could not get there in
time. TAPROOM settled on the fence watching the top two in the first turn, kept a close eye on the lead trio down the back straight, shifted two wide closing
in midway on the far turn, chased the front pair in the two path at the top of the stretch and stubbornly dug in with rivals on both sides, gaining on the winner
late but just lost the nod for place. PRINCESS O DENMARK was brushed inside on the start, regrouped to lead the field into the first turn, had a length
advantage comfortably setting the pace along the backside, was collared outside by the winner with five sixteenths from home, battled determinedly inside
down the lane, began to get leg weary in the final few strides and faded late to settle on the fringes. POWAQA travelled on the rail near the rear in the
beginning, started to smartly go past runners inside at the half mile marker, began to nicely lengthen her stride three furlongs from home, had to be taken
hold off when coming up quickly on a tiring rival on the fence nearing the quarter pole, shifted outside off the weakening runner at the top of the lane and
finished with purpose in deep stretch. LADIES RUM travelled between runners in the two path in midfield early on, improved slightly to stalk in the third flight
outside horse down the backstretch, was struggling to maintain position when coaxed three wide on the final bend, shifted out to the five path for the drive
and finished up evenly to the wire. OLIVIA'S MELODY settled near the back of the pack in the two path in the beginning, made little improvement along the
back straight, was not making any headway on the far turn, angled out to the four path but lacked a bid in the stretch drive. BRIT was steadied soon after
the break stalking near the back three wide outside foes in the first bend, made no progress down the back straight, offered a mild run around horses four
wide on the far turn, angled out widest, in the six path for the drive, drifted inwards when urged right handed in upper stretch and could not be a presence in
the drive to the finish line. ANNIA CORNIFICIA F trailed the field in the first turn, continued to see the pack down the backside, could not offer a rally in the
final bend and passed a couple of stragglers at the furlong marker. LANEY GRACE settled three wide outside runners in mid-pack on the first turn, made
little progress outside foes along the backside, was roused midway on the final turn, offered no response and could not get involved running in the five path
between horses down the stretch. MADAM GWEN veered out on the break, pressed the pace inside into the first turn, tracked in the two path along the
back straight, was hard ridden three furlongs out, had nothing to give and backed through the field on the fence by the quarter pole.
