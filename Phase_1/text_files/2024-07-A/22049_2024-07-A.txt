Footnotes
EMPRESSUM away cleanly, broke in a path, head and head early with LONDON TOBY, took the lead within the first hundred yards, edged away from field
passing the gap, and held JERIKO at bay under a hand drive throughout. JERIKO broke in, drifted out early, asked right handed to maintain straight path,
and kept on while not making up meaningful ground to the wire. LONDON TOBY away cleanly, up close first hundred yards, lightly asked passing the gap,
had a wide path, and steadily lost ground to the wire. LAWLESS WALLACE away best, quickly overtaken, drifted in a bit, and briefly wandered, kept on to
the wire while besting the rest. DONT SASS KVN broke in, quickly down a half length first fifty yards, kept under a hand ride, down over a length
approaching the gap, minor drifting midway, and kept to a hand drive to the wire. EDBERG VERDE away cleanly, drifted in, asked midway, and drifted out
to the wire. NORMANDY away cleanly, quickly put in a uncomfortable spot by stablemate, shied a bit away, briefly steadied when LAWLESS WALLACE
drifted in again, and mildly asked to the wire. TERRIFIC PHOENIX outbroke by most at the start, shifted out, and took a couple awkward strides, asked right
handed early, lacked a path crossing the gap, altered in three paths midway, and kept to task to the wire. DON LAZARO broke in, mildly floated out by
JERIKO early, lacked acceleration, mildly floated out again early, and not asked to the wire. JESS BEING A FRIEND caught bad timing, false broke, came
away slow, and lost all chance at the start.
