Footnotes
SAFFRON gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the three path, dug in for the lead nearing mid-stretch and was steadily handled
to draw off. MISS PEARL HART rated a clear early lead inside, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on the turn, gave
up the lead while lugging in under right hand urging mid-stretch and settled for second best. THUNDAR CLOUD chased through the backstretch, rounded
the turn near the rail, was shut off and altered course mid-stretch but came back to finish evenly. MISS SHACK ATTACK chased, raced near the rail on the
turn and improved her position. FLEETNESS chased, rounded the turn about the three path and flattened in the lane. HEY MACARENA was not a factor.
MY SOFIA ROSE gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail and weakened in the lane. After conducting an inquiry for the incident in mid-stretch, the
Stewards disqualified Miss Pearl Hart to third place for interfering with the progress of Thunder Cloud.

PASS THE CASH angled in and took the lead two deep approaching the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, raced at the
rail on the far turn and was kept sharp through the lane. EIGHT OZ MOCHA settled in the three path the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
raced off the rail on the far turn and closed the gap in an even finish. DEE DEE SIX raced off the rail on the opening turn, gave chase from the half mile
pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and passed a rival in the lane. MAIDENS BLUSH saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing
the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. I'M FRIESAN raced with the early pace inside then stalked leaving
the nine sixteenths pole, gave chase toward the three eighths but weakened into the far turn. KATAKANA rounded the opening turn about the four path and
showed little response through the backstretch. SUGGAFREE DAIQUIR settled into a lope shortly after the start.

Footnotes
HEADS OR TAILS stalked off the rail the first turn, challenged approaching the quarter pole and took the lead at the rail midway through the far turn, dug in
under steady handling and held on well. MARK DID IT rounded the opening turn in the four path, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, raced in the
three path on the far turn and dug in to clear second inside the sixteenth pole. MONTAUK DADDY took over nearing the three quarter pole and tapered to
the inside to show the way, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, gave up the lead off the rail midway on the far turn, dropped back
nearing the head of the lane and weakened mid-stretch. ROCKY DICE saved ground on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and improved
steadily at the rail on the far turn, but flattened leaving the turn. ANTIPOISON raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths
pole and rounded the far turn about the four path, then flattened in the lane. HAPPY CHAMP was pinched back at the start and raced off the rail the first
turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and showed little in the lane. CAYENNE CREEK was bumped leaving
the gate, rounded the first turn about the three path and showed little response through the backstretch. REY O REYES rated close inside on the first turn
then faded through the backstretch. PRIZE FIGHTER ducked outward at the break and made contact with Cayenne Creek, rounded the opening turn about
the three path, gave chase toward the three eighths pole and weakened off the rail on the far turn.
