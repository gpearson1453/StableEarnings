Footnotes
SIX THE HARD WAY was well placed two wide and then saved ground on the far turn and eased out and made a three wide bid off the turn, then slowly
wore down the pacesetter to get up late to prove best under crop urging. ANGELAS PARTY GIRL set the pace on the inside and came two wide off the turn,
dug in gamely in the drive but was caught late to just fail. VIKING QUEEN was rank and four wide on the first turn, went up to press the pace and then
stalked the pace three wide on the far turn, came four wide off the bend and then was slowly gaining late but needed more. BRAVO ZULU was settled two
wide early, came three wide off the bend and had no kick. CAGED PIXIE tracked the early pace on the inside, then fell back entering the far turn and moved
out on the far turn, came four wide off the bend and had no late kick. MURUMBI chased the pace four wide and weakened. TWEET AWAY ROBIN was off
very slowly and trailed throughout. After a STEWARDS INQUIRY the number six TWEET AWAY ROBIN was declared a non starter deemed to being
handled when the gates opened.

DISTORTED D'ORO set a pressured pace on the inside, then was sent down leaving the turn and moved out nearing the gap and bumped PLANET CLARE
then was corrected and dug in gamely and edged clear to prove best, driving. PLANET CLARE pressed the winner three wide, then made a two wide bid by
the quarter pole, was bumped nearing the gap and drifted out, then came back in and finished willingly despite hanging in the final furlong. NORMANJITO
(FR) was settled early on the inside, then was coxed along and made a four wide move by the quarter pole and between rivals, then rallied well late but
needed more. WELLAREYOUHAPPYNOW was off slowly spotting the field about four lengths, settled two to three wide, made a five wide move by the
quarter pole and spun wide out of the turn and offered a belated rally on the outside. JUST GREAT tracked the pace from between rivals and faded.
FLOWER MOUND tracked the pace from the outside and was three wide on the far turn and weakened. SWEET MISS MAGGIE tracked the pace on the
inside and steadied by the quarter pole and was eased to the wire and walked off. TRAINER of number five PLANET CLARE lodged an OBJECTION
against the winner DISTORTED D'ORO in the run through the stretch, after the STEWARDS reviewed the replays the OBJECTION was disallowed and the
race was made official as is.

SUNNY BREEZE set the pace on the inside and was well handled, turned back a bid from RAINY SKIES by the quarter pole and shook clear while coming
into the lane in the two path, then remained clear to the wire to prove best under. EXCITABLE BOY tracked the early pace and saved ground on the turn,
made a bid on the inside leaving the turn and angled out by the sixteenth marker but could not get to the winner while finishing willingly and being second
best. RAINY SKIES stalked the winner early two wide, made a two to three wide bid by the quarter pole to vie for command but flattened out in the lane,
bested rest. PACO THE TACO MAN was settled early, three wide on the turn and shifted in by the quarter pole to be on the inside into the lane and
weakened. YO YO CANDY chased the early pace three wide, made a mild bid three wide on the far turn and came four wide off the bend and was empty.

WHISKEY DECISION prompted the pace two to three wide, made a two wide bid entering the far turn and was clear by the quarter pole, then drew out in
the final furlong to prove best under crop urging. BELLE OF RIGHTS was settled on the inside, then was coaxed along by the five sixteenth s and moved
out to be three wide by the quarter pole, angled out to the outside and finished well to be clearly second best. STYLE POINTS tracked the early pace three
to two wide, made a three wide bid by the quarter pole and loomed boldly off the bend but flattened out in the final furlong, held show award. MONT SAINT
MICHEL (FR) tracked the pace along the inside, came four wide off the bend and kept on while missing the show award. CAP CLASSIQUE was settled
back early, saved ground on the turn, angled out nearing the furlong marker and had a belated rally. DOESN'THURTTOFLIRT was reserved early, three
wide on the far turn and had no rally. PARISH LANE was settled back early, two wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. SOURCE (GB) was off slowly, then
advanced to chase the pace two to three wide and weakened. NAY SLAYER set the pace on the inside and then dueled with the winner before giving way.

Footnotes
DEAN DELIVERS prompted the early pace three to two wide, made a two wide bid by the quarter pole to duel for command, spun three wide off the bend
and drew clear in the final furlong to prove best under crop urging. PRINCE OF JERICHO chased the pace and made a inside bid leaving the turn to be
clearly second best. GORDIAN KNOT tracked the pace on the outside and made a bid four wide by the quarter pole, came five wide off the bend and
gained the show award late. SUPER CHOW stumbled at the break, then recovered and set the pace on the inside, then dueled for command by the quarter
pole and weakened in the final furlong losing the show award late. AMERICAN MONARCH was settled early, came four wide into the lane and improved
position late. SIR WELLINGTON lunged at the start, stalked the pace three wide and weakened. O'CONNER SUNSET was off slowly and never factored.

Footnotes
DESVIO tracked the early pace from between rivals, then made a three wide bid leaving the turn to vie for command, then was brushed and pushed out
leaving the furlong marker and edged clear in the final sixteenth to prove best under a drive. NOMOS was well placed along the inside, blocked in upper
stretch, then got room by the gap and closed up the inside to gain the place award late. SPIRIT PRINCE prompted the pace under a hard hold while two
wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to gain a short lead, then drifted out leaving the furlong marker and faded late, held show award. EL MATADOR was
reserved early, then commenced a rally leaving the five sixteenths and moved out and came widest into the lane and was closing full of run on the outside,
then was cut off by DESVIO leaving the furlong marker and lost momentum and then got back into stride and missed the show award. FRONTLINE
WARRIOR was allowed to settle early, commenced a rally and came five wide into the lane, then was blocked behind rivals nearing the furlong ]marker,
angled in looking for room and then was blocked late again losing all chance, brutal trip. ST JAMES THE GREAT was settled back early, advanced on the
far turn and came four wide into the lane and had a belated rally. WILLY D'S set the pace on the inside and then dueled for command and gave way in the
drive. FORT THOMAS was reserved early and lacked a serious rally. VILLAIN stalked the pace on the outside and tired. TRIPLE ESPRESSO was reserved
early and then pulled up entering the second turn and then was loaded on to the Equine Ambulance. DOMINGO lost the rider at the start, walked off.
STEWARDS INQUIRY concerning the start and the number nine SPIRIT PRINCE in the stretch, along with a JOCKEYS OBJECTION number eleven EL
MATADOR against the winner number eight DESVIO for interference in the stretch, after reviewing the replays the STEWARDS ruled no change and the
race was made official as is.

POWER SQUEEZE was settled early on the outside, moved up four wide by the five eights marker to tracked the pace and keep SIDAMARA to her inside,
then made a three wide move on the far turn and came into the lane three wide then dueled for command by the sixteenth marker and won the bob gamely
to prevail under a drive. SIDAMARA was off a beat slow, quickly recovered and was rated kindly two wide behind the trio up on the pace, then was boxed in
leaving the five furlong marker , moved out and commenced a rally by the five sixteenths to be four wide by the quarter pole, then closed well to duel with
the winner leaving the sixteenth marker and fought on but just missed. REGALED was taken back early to be far back, saved ground on the far turn, angled
out by the three sixteenths and closed the gap fast to gain the show award. CALL ANOTHER PLAY pressed the early pace from the inside, continued on
the rail while close up on the far turn, then kept on but was in traffic leaving the furlong marker and moved out by the sixteenth marker and ran on but lost
the show award late. RINGY DINGY set a pressured pace two wide, was well handled and made a bid to shake clear by the quarter pole, then remained
clear off the turn but weakened in the final furlong. PRINCESS INDY stalked the early pace and then went up to press the pace three wide by the nine
sixteenths, then was two wide off the turn and weakened in the lane. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
