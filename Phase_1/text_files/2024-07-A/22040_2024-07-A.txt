WENDELSSOHN vied with an inner pair of rivals early on, cleared those troubled counterparts approaching the three furlong pole and kicked away under a
drive. DUKE OF DUVAL brushed with an outer rival at the start, backed off to pursue from the rear in the two path, then between horses at the the three
furlong pole, advanced inside of rivals entering upper stretch, gained place leaving the furlong grounds but failed to threaten the leader. SHORTSTOP
brushed the outer half of the starting gate upon leaving it, chased the leading trio from the three two to path into the turn, shifted three wide while between
horses nearing the lane, got outkicked by an inner rival entering it yet ran on to edge show in the final furlong. MORUNNING brushed with an inner rival at
the start, vied two wide and between horses, proved no match for his outer clearing counterpart approaching the three furlong pole after his inner competitor
faltered into the turn, then tired between horses in the lante. BERNIN HOT bobbled subtly at the start, lacked speed four wide and failed to menace. BIG
SALT LICK vied for the lead with an outer pair of rivals early on, steadied hard when put to tight quarters entering the turn, then faltered quickly in the
aftermath.

Footnotes
SING SING vied for the lead inside of a prompting rival, cleared that one while shifting off of the fence entering the lane, fended off an inner pursuer through
midstretch and lasted from an outer on-charging bidder at the wire. GIOCOSO brushed with an outer rival at the start, saved ground pursuing from midpack,
shifted out to the four path entering the final furlong, surged to quickly close in on the leader late but came up short. COURAGEOUS CLAY stalked along
the inside, took aim inside of the newly clear leader in upper stretch, but was fended off while hanging on his left lead and needed more. BRIGHT SKITTLE
vied outside of the eventual winner around both turns, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, yielded yet sustained pursuit through the final furlong.
MAXIMUM PROMISE rated towards the rear in the three path, advanced between horses around the far turn, swung out to the six path in upper stretch and
mildly sustained progress. HOMER'S ODYSSEY tracked two wide, awaited racing room between horses turning for home, claimed fourth entering the lane
before being floated out to the five path leaving upper stretch, and yielded shorty after. THUBOOT brushed an inner rival, grabbed his own quarter and
stumbled shortly after the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, then in the three path around the far turn, shifted inwardly in upper stretch and lacked a
rally. STRUMMIN got floated out into the first turn, recovered pursuing from midpack four to three wide around that bend, gave way down the backstretch,
sustained pursuit five wide around the far turn before floating to the seven path entering the lane, and failed to menace. COLONEL YORKE broke a step
slow, pursued from midpack two to four wide, then faded. RAG TREE lacked speed tucking to the inside around the first turn, trailed and made little impact.
BRERETON'S BAYTOWN was reluctant to load, broke a beat slow, tugged forward between horses into the first turn to prompt outside of the top pair
around that bend, failed to sustain pressure down the backstretch, chased then weakened between horses through the lane. PATRIOTIC JERRELL laid off
of the pace two wide and tired.

SING A LITTLE SONG was bumped between horses at the start, stalked the leading trio from the two path, split foes to bid three wide entering the lane,
drove clear in upper stretch before meeting an outer challenge in the final furlong, dug in and prevailed gamely. POPPERINA was off slowly, trailed in the
three to four path, picked up stride swinging five wide entering the lane, rallied to bid outside of the leader in the final furlong, dueled into deep stretch but
hung late and was turned away. TELL ME WHEN broke outwardly into open space at the start, showed the way inside of a pair of pressers into the turn, got
headed by his most immediate counterpart nearing the lane, got outkicked by wider rivals in upper stretch, held show into the final furlong while hanging on
his left lead, then saved that position from an inner challenger at the wire. JE SUIS RAPIDE leaned out at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path,
shifted inwardly in the lane, ran on mildly to offer a late inside bid for show but missed. MOTOWN DYNAMIC broke a bit outwardly at the start, pressed three
wide, failed to sustain pressure and chased turning for home, got floated four wide into the lane and faded between horses. THREE POLKS bumped an
inner rival at the start, prompted two wide and between horses, led narrowly approaching the lane, but got outkicked by an outer bidder entering upper
stretch and weakened while hanging on his left lead. ANIMAL FRIES bumped with an outer rival at the start, lacked speed along the inside and got outrun.

SHE'S LOOKIN LUCKY stalked two wide and between horses, bid along with an outer rival around the far turn, forged an advantage entering the lane in the
three path, drove clear and held sway. MAKE THE BOYS WINK settled off of the pace three wide, awaited racing room two wide around the far turn, split
foes three wide at the furlong grounds to take aim inside of the new leader, but only managed to chase that one home. EXCELLENT QUESTION bumped
the gate and broke a step slow, saved ground off of the pace, split foes three wide in the final furlong and edged show. CROWN IMPERIAL tracked along
the inside, bided time behind the leaders turning for home, took aim inside of them in upper stretch but lacked the needed punch. SAMAY (PER) sped clear
around the first turn, met a pair of outer challenges turning for home, got headed in the two path in upper stretch and faded between horses. HONEY
HAULER bobbled slightly and brushed with an outer rival at the start, stalked three wide, bid turning for home, chased in the four path and between horses
into the lane and gave way. PEACOCK LASS pursued from midpack two wide, inched closer four wide along with an outer rival around the far turn, was
within striking range in the five path entering the lane, but yielded. HOLY FOLEY brushed with an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path,
gained five wide and outside of foes turning for home to be within range six wide entering the lane, but flattened out.

Footnotes
KING'S GLORY prompted outside of the top pair, stalked before dueling in the four path entering the lane, sparred through midstretch, led narrowly late and
held from an outer challenger. BAD BOY FRANK trailed early on, gained inside of rivals around the turn, swung out to the five path in upper stretch,
sustained his rally to bid outside of the leader in the final sixteenth but was denied. ATTACHE set a pressured pace along the inside, dueled with an outer
bidder while entering the lane in the two path, sparred gamely while narrowly headed in the final furlong, fought on doggedly into deep stretch but was
bested. MIRACLE WORKER laid off of the pace along the inside, gained ground passing the three furlong pole, took aim inside of the leaders entering
upper stretch, but only managed to chase and needed more. SAHALAT tracked along the inside, vacated the rail entering the turn, got outmoved by an
inner rival at the three furlong pole, chased from the two to four path turning for home, then improved between horses late. REGAL REY laid off of the pace
in the five to six path, then pursued evenly and failed to threaten. TIGER'S LEGACY vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but yielded in the three
path entering the lane. LAKOTA TERRITORY brushed with an inner rival at the start, chased forwardly in the four path, then faded between horses around
the turn. MOREAU brushed with an outer foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path and was through early.

Footnotes
HELLO HOLLYWOOD pursued from midpack in the three path and between horses, tracked the main group around the far turn, shifted inwardly in upper
stretch, offered a rail grind to bid inside of the leader in the final sixteenth and edged an advantage in the shadow of the wire. KEHOE BEACH was last
away before rushing forward early on, moved to set the pace tucking from the three to two path around the first turn, felt mild pressure from an outer rival
around the far turn, shook free in upper stretch, held sway as an inner rival took aim in the final sixteenth, but was caught by that bidder at the wire, then
bumped the inner rail and dislodged his rider in the gallop out. GOLD LIGHTNING trailed in the two to three path, gained between horses before swinging
six wide into the lane, rallied widest and edged show. KALISPERA (IRE) laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the five path entering the lane,
rallied along with an outer rival and missed show. WEIGH THE RISKS stalked outside of the leader into the backstretch, pressed around the far turn, but
failed to keep pace entering upper stretch, yet sustained a chase between horses thereafter. SASSY PRINCESS tracked in the two path, ranged up outside
of the leading pair and in the four path around the far turn to attempt a bid entering the lane, but flattened out in upper stretch before tiring between horses.
QUIETLY laid off of the pace along the inside, advanced up a vacated rail moving down the backstretch, chased forwardly around the far turn but gave way.
FEDERALISM laid off of the pace in the four to five path, entered the lane in the six path and failed to factor. FROSTED VICTORY tracked in the four path,
chased into the far turn, then faltered between horses turning for home.
