Footnotes
LITTLE BLAZE vied two wide into the turn, assumed command with three furlongs to go, drew off turning for home and widened under a drive. SPARKLE
OF HOPE stalked outside of the leading pair early on, gained place while chasing the clearing leader nearing the quarter pole, was no match for that one yet
remained clear of the rest. TRAVAILLE tracked along the inside, chased in the two path around the turn, gained show from an inner rival entering the final
furlong and held that position from an outer foe. CITY SHACK trailed in the two path, swung out to the seven path entering the lane and failed to menace.
PIONEER PARADE vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner early on, but proved no match for that one with three furlongs to go and weakened.

Footnotes
DREAM ON prompted outside of the leader into the turn, bid sparking a duel nearing the lane, wrestled a narrow margin in upper stretch then inched ahead
in the closing stages. BRIE'S IN TOWN set the pace inside of a sternly pressing rival, dueled with that bidder nearing the lane, fought on gamely through the
final furlong while headed but was bested late. SWEET FANTASY broke inwardly, trailed along the inside, slipped through narrow rail quarters inside of
rivals entering the lane to grab show in upper stretch, then gradually closed in on the top pair late. COACH CLINT leaned in and broke a step slow while last
away, recovered to stalk outside of the top pair, but chased them approaching the lane and yielded. WACO raced forwardly along the inside while subtly
keen early on, chased while getting outmoved by an inner rival entering upper stretch and gave way. BET ON BRET broke half a beat slow, laid off of the
pace in the two to three path before shifting four wide turning for home, but lacked a bid. GROUND SHAKER tracked two wide and between horses, but
faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
WEATHER MAP pressed outside of the leader along with an outer rival around the turn, chased the pace setter in upper stretch, kept on in pursuit in the
final furlong, closed in once again to offer a re-bid leaving the sixteenth pole and edged past late. MISS SAIPAN set the pace along the inside as a pair of
outer rivals applied pressure, shook free of them in upper stretch, but failed to contain an outer counterpart in the final sixteenth and gave in late. ICED
MOCHA brushed an outer rival at the start, stalked three deep, bore to the five path around the bend before recovering to sustain pressure in the four path
turning for home, but yielded to her inner counterparts in upper stretch, yet sustained stride in the final furlong to hold show. ALMOND FUDGE tracked
along the inside and lacked a bid. FANCY PRANCE chased in the three path and between rivals into the turn, shifted out to the five path into upper stretch
and gave way. AGENT bobbled subtly while breaking outwardly at the start, laid off of the pace in the four path and tired. ZERO CLICK took light contact
from an inner rival and quickly dropped back at the start, lagged behind the rest around the turn and never got involved.

Footnotes
BOLTORO laid off of the pace in the three path, fanned five wide entering the lane to take aim outside of the rivals, rallied to drive past the leader at the
sixteenth pole and drew clear. TIZ SWEET EMOTION pressed two wide, bid and vied turning for home, forged an advantage entering the lane, led through
midstretch, but was caught by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole then safely managed place. CHA CHA CHUKKA was bumped by an inner rival leaving
the gate, tracked two wide and between horses, came under coaxing along the inside around the far turn, then sustained grinding progress up the rail to bid
for show in the late stages, and prevailed. GOURMET stalked along the inside, brushed an outer rival while vacating the rail entering the lane, chased the
leaders between horses into the final furlong, vied for show with an inner bidder in the late stages but was bested. WHY WASTE WORDS laid off of the
pace along the inside, took the far turn in the three path, shfited out to the five to six path coming to midstretch and ran on mildly while failing to threaten.
TWO LUCYS tracked three wide, got brushed to the four path by an inner rival entering the lane, then yielded between horses. CLASSIC CLAIRE showed
the way along the inside, got headed by an outer bidder entering the lane and caved between horses. TIDAL TACTICS broke outwardly and bumped a rival
at the start, laid off of the pace in the two to four path around the first turn, shifted out to the six to seven path in upper stretch and failed to factor. E B
ZOOM BABY broke a step slow, trailed along the inside and never got involved.

Footnotes
WELAKA broke a beat slow, laid off of the pace along the inside, took closer order to track the embattled leading pair down the backstretch, bid inside of
them with five sixteenths to go, dueled with an outer game THE THUNDERER through the lane and narrowly prevailed. THE THUNDERER prompted
outside of the pace setter and from the three path, dueled with that one down the backstretch and into the far turn, dug in as an inner rival issued a
challenge turning for home, battled with that one while gamely clinging to an advantage into deep stretch but missed at the wire. NAVY SOUL trailed in the
two path, improved past an outer pair with five furlongs to go, chased in the four path turning for home, gained show entering the lane in the five path and
failed to threaten the top pair. EFFICIENCY broke a beat slow, pursued from midpack in the five path before tucking to the three path entering the
backstretch, shifted back to the five path around the far turn, chased while getting floated to the six path entering the lane and tired. CAMP DADDY dueled
for the lead with an outer rival while remaining a path off of the inner rail, but yielded when an inner bidder issued a challenge at the five sixteenths pole and
weakened. HUGE BIGLY tracked in the four path and steadily faded.

FUERTEVENTURA pressed outside of the leader, bid as an outer rival applied pressure turning for home, sparred with his inner counterpart through the
lane while wrestling an advantage, led led and held from an outer challenger. QUADRA ISLAND stalked along the inside, pursued in upper stretch, shifted
outside of the top pair in the final furlong, sustained progress in hopes of offering a late bid but just came up short. OSCAR ECLIPSE showed the way as an
outer rival applied pressure, vied with that one turning for home, dueled gamely through the final furlong while headed and got bested. BARBERINI laid off
of the pace two wide and between horses, tracked in the three to four path around the far turn, sustained grinding progress through the lane but needed
more late. GENTLE SOUL trailed along the inside, then two wide around the far turn before swinging to the four to five path in upper stretch, and ran on
belatedly. ELUSIVE TARGET tracked three deep, chased between horses around the far turn and lacked a bid. HIDDEN STASH laid off of the pace in the
four path, steadily advanced approaching the far turn to press outside of the leading pair turning for home, but weakened between horses in upper stretch.
ODE TO BALIUS laid off of the pace along the inside, took closer order to track briefly down the backstretch, but gave way around the far turn.

DBOOK laid off of the pace in the four path, rallied to close in on the tiring leader in the final sixteenth and caught him at the wire. MUSIC MAN showed the
way early on, built a clear margin while traveling well in hand in the two path around the turn, came under a drive hanging on his left lead in upper stretch,
changed over while still well clear at the sixteenth pole, but tired late and got nailed by an outer bidder at the wire. SUNNY MAGIC chased along the inside
while hustled along, got outkicked for show by an outer rival entering the lane, yet kept on to regain that position in the final sixteenth. SELL IT pressed
outside of the leader early on, chased that one from the three path while failing to sustain pressure around the turn, then tired between horses. GALLO DE
FUEGO broke slowly and showed little.

RUNNIN' ROCKET prompted the pace two wide, bid nearing the lane, sparred with the pace setter through midstretch, drifted about slightly before gaining
an advantage at the sixteenth pole and drove clear. LINZER showed the way inside of a prompting rival, dug in to resist that one's bid nearing the lane,
dueled gamely through midstretch, but was bested at the sixteenth pole, then held place late. ARABIAN PRINCE trailed along the inside, briefly
encountered traffic behind rivals nearing the lane, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, ran on to edge show in the final sixteenth and needed more to
bid for place. TRUE JEDI stalked along the inside, came under coaxing around the turn, chased into the lane and yielded. POLSTER tracked two wide and
between horses, shifted four wide in upper stretch and failed to menace. PLAUSIBLE DENILE tracked three wide, got floated five wide in upper stretch and
gave way.

at the sixteenth pole, dueled and prevailed. TOP GUN ROCKET pressed three deep, dueled with a short advantage around the far turn, led into the final
furlong, dug in to resist a pair of outer challenges at the sixteenth pole, but was bested and saved place. TAPIT FOR THE WIN bounced off an inner rival
into an outer foe at the start, tracked in the three path and between horses, stalked with run behind the leaders around the far turn, took aim along with an
outer rival in upper stretch, bid between horses at the sixteenth pole, but got outfinished and missed place. BOURBON SOCIETY bumped with an outer rival
at the start, set a pressured pace, dueled while subtly headed by an outer foe around the far turn, battled on into upper stretch but gave way in the final
furlong. STORMY PASSAGE stalked along the inside, chased turning for home and yielded. BLACK IRON tracked five to four wide and gave way. MISSION
