Footnotes
SWEET NELLIE gradually angled out leaving the chute, set the pace just off the inside then gradually opened up under urging in the stretch. ROCK THE
BIRDHOUSE moved to the inside early on, made her bid along the rail in the lane, took over second midstretch then could only pull away for the place in the
late going. GREER CROSSING gradually angled in leaving the chute, pressed SWEET NELLIE from outside, weakened for the drive but was easily best of
the others. LINDALOUIMAGE caught in crowding as she tried to avoid GREER CROSSING leaving the chute, bumped with SUPERTRIX, was a factor on
the backstretch but faded widest on the bend. SUPERTRIX was bumped, squeezed then checked leaving the chute and failed to menace in a
ground-saving trip. WARM BEAUTY a step slow at the break, was steadied behind traffic a few strides out of the gate and always outrun.

Footnotes
JOYFUL GHOST rated just off the early speed, went for the lead when allowed three wide on the bend then gradually drew off under urging in the lane.
MAJESTIC ATTACK broke inward, bumping BRIANS WAY, pressed ON K P from just outside, fought for second two wide in the stretch and edged ahead
of ON K P with sixty yards left. ON K P broke outward, also bumping BRIAN WAY, was sent to set a pressured pace from inside, challenged on the turn, no
match for JOYFUL GHOST in the stretch, battled to keep second, did not have enough left in the waning yards but was clearly best of the rest. VALIANTLY
DISCREET chased from between horses, came into the stretch from path four and had no late bid. BRIANS WAY was bumped from both sides at the break,
chased from inside, angled out through the turn and also had no stretch rally. SANTINO'S FANTASY very fractious in the gate, was taken out, okayed to run
after examination by the veterinarian then reloaded, broke alertly once the race began, quickly retreated, stayed unnecessarily wide and showed little.

Footnotes
SEMINOLE BEACH pressed from between horses, rallied two wide inside the last eighth, edged ahead with a sixteenth left and held on. EURO SUPRISE
prominent from outside, was three wide taking the bend, rallied belatedly deep stretch but caught PEACOCK MAN for second in the waning yards.
PEACOCK MAN was hustled to set a pressured pace inside rivals but slow wore down inside the final furlong. AFRICAN WARRIOR broke in the air,
advanced to contention from outside, was widest taking the turn then ran evenly trough the lane. JOEY B was an early factor just off inside, improved
position along the rail on the bend but could only make up minor ground deep stretch. FRONTANA chased from inside, came off the rail some on the turn,
gradually angled out widest upper stretch but lacked a significant response. MADE TO FIT was checked off heels as his path closed shortly after entering
the main track, raced in contention toward the outside on the backstretch but faded two wide on the turn.

GHALY POSSE pressed from inside, did not keep up after two furlong, found herself boxed in on the bend, altered out leaving the quarter pole, bumping
GOLDICAT, gained a clear path two wide entering the stretch, battled between rivals and edged ahead late. LOVEYOULIKECRAZY was hustled along early
to set the pace just off the inside, moved clear after a quarter mile, took the rail nearing the end of a half mile, was challenged in the lane, fought gamely but
did not have enough left in the waning yards. GOLDICAT prominent between rivals, advanced two wide on the turn, was bumped and forced out slightly
leaving the turn, dueled for the lead outside GHALY POSSE upper stretch, gradually wore down inside the final eighth but was easily best of the others.
WICKED SKY chased from just off the inside and lacked a stretch rally. SHINE DOWN chased while toward the outside, angled out widest upper stretch
then slowly drifted out the last furlong. WILDWOOD TRIPLE was a contender three or four wide for a half mile then gave way.

Footnotes
DIAMONDONICE broke somewhat awkwardly, steadily progressed from outside to vie for the lead four wide on the turn, edged ahead under urging upper
stretch, moved clear inside the last furlong then maintained control under confident handling. MADI'S CIRCLE settled inside, picked up her pace and
gradually angled out through the bend, lost ground fanning five wide for the stretch run, rallied belatedly but swept past HAND OVER MY HEART to gain
second nearing the wire. HAND OVER MY HEART was hustled along to prompt the pace just outside FIVEO'CLOCKCHARLIE, edged ahead on the turn,
was overtaken upper stretch and gradually wore down the final furlong. C C RITHMS prominent from outside, was three wide on the bend, fanned out
behind DIAMONDONICE entering the lane and flattened. FIVEO'CLOCKCHARLIE was hustled to set a pressured pace from inside but began to wear down
before finishing a half mile. SPEEDY OWENS hesitated then swiped the gate breaking inward, moved to the rail with four furlong to go then faded on the
bend. PETE'S LEGACY failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. ZEE FIRE also hesitated at the start and showed little. CELIA'S CIRCLE reluctant to load,
raced in contention between horses on the backstretch but gave way two wide on the turn.

AWESOME BIRDIE was on the front end between horses, moved clear when allowed after two furlongs, stayed just off the inside, put to urging upper
stretch, began to wear down deep stretch but dug in and held on. CANTOO raced in contention from outside, lost considerable ground five wide through the
bend, drifted out some midstretch, was soon straightened, surged inside the final furlong, came up a bit short but caught WILDWOOD POSSE for second at
the wire. WILDWOOD POSSE was reluctant to load, lugged in some just after the break, was prominent from inside, appeared to brush with FREE LOVE
after travelling the first eighth, angled outside AWESOME BIRDIE on the turn and was also closing in on the weakening leader deep stretch. JULYNNE was
checked when WILDWOOD POSSE came close shortly after the start, steadily advanced from inside to loom a threat deep stretch but did not have enough
left in the waning yards. FREE LOVE in tight quarters between AWESOME BIRDIE and WILDWOOD POSSE after the first furlong, did not keep up four
wide on the bend and also rallied belatedly inside the last eighth.

I'M YOUR VALENTINE moved up between rivals to share the lead just outside ARGYBARGY BUCK on the backstretch, was roused on the second bend,
dueled through the lane and edged ahead of the latter inside the final sixteenth. ARGYBARGY BUCK moved clear on the first turn, was challenged from
outside on the backstretch, just off the rail through the second turn, put to urging with a quarter mile to go, gained the rail upper stretch, fought gamely to the
wire but did not have enough left in the late going. COPPER CROSSING well placed inside from the early going, lost his path to ARGYBARGY upper
stretch, altered out three wide with a furlong left, lacked the extra needed but won his battle for third. CHARM THE LADIES was urged up to contention
along the rail on the backstretch, failed to keep up while just off the inside through the second bend, angled out to path four at the top of the stretch, loomed
a threat with a furlong to go, also failed to have the needed kick, fought for third to the wire, was narrowly outfinished but easily best of the rest. PERFECT
WAGER crowded briefly shortly after the start, chased from off the inside, angled out seven wide at the top of the stretch for a clear path and passed a few
tired rivals. WARNING LABEL bumped from the rear at the break, raced in contention five or six wide to the top of the lane then gave way. DRAMA CRITIC
broke outward, bumped WARNING LABEL then altered in crowding PERFECT WAGER, soon progressed between rivals, was also a factor to the stretch
then gave way as well. KEEN RESPONSE showed little in a wide trip. LASTFORTINOFAMILY quickly retreated from inside and soon was distanced from
the field, galloped the rest of the course and walked off.

Footnotes
VIVA VIOLENCE crowded briefly at the start, was kept close, angled outside GOLD OAK midway on the backstretch, gradually angled out as she rallied to
stay clear of the latter the last furlong and got up in the final strides. GOLD OAK broke on top and was quickly clear of the others, soon had the inside,
floated out some entering the lane, started drifting out as she wore down inside the final eighth and had to settle for second best. ONACOUNTA broke
inward, bumping solidly with SCAPITURE, was settled just off the inside, fanned three wide for the drive and showed a willingness to run late. CHANEL
POINT broke slowly, improved position from inside under urging on the backstretch, continued to save ground through the turn and had no late bid.
SCAPITURE bumped solidly at the start, was forced in some, steadied and never a factor.
