Footnotes
KIMCHI CAT bumped with a rival at the start, showed speed then set the pace under pressure from her outside, moved clear at the seven-sixteenths pole,
controlled the action in the two the three path on the turn, responded well when put to a right-handed crop and extended the advantage in upper stretch,
switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under a strong hand-ride in the final sixteenth. ELEMIAH was bumped
soundly at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the three then four path on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and
proved no match while just able to get the place. SILVER CIRCLE chased the pace, raced in the four path early on the turn then dropped to the two path,
moved to the rail late on that bend, kept on willingly in the stretch and just missed the place while clear for the show. LA CARA chased the pace on the
outside, dropped back late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the five path, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and tired. BOSSY
PANTS broke a step slow and was last to commence, was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn and failed to rally. SHE'S A GAMER was
ridden along at the rear, moved in leaving the backstretch, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and
failed to threaten. PRACTICAL LOV chased the pace then dropped back late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the three path, spun four wide into
the stretch and came up empty. GOING STEADY broke in and bumped soundly with an opponent, was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn,
was taken in hand off heels when a foe dropped in front outside the quarter-pole, spun three wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
TIVY hustled from the gate, vied briefly with a trio and then a pair of foes from the three path before emerging with sole, albeit narrow command under
pressure from BOURBON'S HOPE to the outside, tucked to the two path through the turn and came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun two to
three wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing lone threat to the outside and noticeably shortened stride
inside the final sixteenth but held safe at the finish. RIDER'S SPECIAL hustled from the start, vied briefly among a quartet before easing off to chase three
wide, tucked inside into the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, closed in on the leader from the
outside through the final furlong surging late but was ultimately staved off at the wire. MAGNIFICENT MILE brushed the near side stall at the start conceding
two to three lengths to the front, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five then four wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild bid. BOURBON'S HOPE coaxed from the start, vied from the four path with a trio and then a pair before emerging to press the pace of
TIVY from the outside, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch and got
shaken off straightened away, then weakened in the late stages. INDEPENDENT PAUL coaxed from the gate, vied early on from the two path until shaken
off and tipped out five furlongs from home to the four path, tucked three then two wide through the turn giving chase under coaxing from the three-eighths,
took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. BLOWN COVER coaxed from the start, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch
before tucking to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and tucked inside midway, angled three wide into upper stretch and
tired. SCREAMING UNCLE bobbled at the break while under coaxing, chased four to five wide coming under coaxing half a mile from home, tucked three
wide through the turn, went four wide at the head of the stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
MY KENTUCKY GIRL chased four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was up in the final jumps to prevail. MIGHTY MADISON broke out at the start,
led briefly early on six paths off the rail before being headed by STARSHIP DEFIANT with five and a half furlongs remaining, settled attending that rival five
then four wide down the backstretch and then three then two wide through the turn on hold, took over command set down spinning four wide into upper
stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat and was caught in the last jumps to the finish while well clear of the rest for
the place honors. SIGNAL FROM NOISE chased along the inside and then just off the inside patiently handled, got set down angled six wide into upper
stretch, offered up a mild kick. BACKYARD MONEY bobbled at the start conceding about two lengths to the front, chased just off the inside and then along
the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and improved position to the finish. INTO HAPPINESS grew detached at
the tail of the field four to five wide when outrun early on, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went eight wide
into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. STARSHIP DEFIANT forwardly placed from the start, advanced four wide to take command five and a half
furlongs from home, settled in hand head cocked to the left side showing the way four then three wide before tucking to the two path into the turn, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, came under pressure and yielded the front spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. MOSIENKO stumbled
at the start conceding three lengths to the front, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and
made no impact.

Footnotes
ITZA MIRRAKLE stalked the pace on the outside in the three path, turned up the pressure while asked on the far turn, took over into upper stretch, drifted in
while moving clear under a right-handed crop coming to the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop inside that marker and held under strong urging.
PROTECTIVE brushed with a foe early, went around the opening bend in the two path, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the four path on the
far turn then chased the pace, was driven five wide into the stretch, pursued the winner into the final furlong, drifted in near the sixteenth-pole and safely
secured the place. MILITARY ROAD was hustled to the front, showed the way in the two path, was urged along under pressure on the far turn, lost the
advantage into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired but was well clear for the show. ELKO COUNTY brushed with a foe early then
dropped back between horses, moved in to save ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, shifted from the
rail to the two path near the five-sixteenths pole, was driven four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. TRULLI WARRIOR was hustled from the gate,
brushed with foes early, raced in the three path under restraint on the first turn, settled more kindly down the backstretch, was urged along with a half-mile to
run, went three wide on the far turn and faltered. HAIZUM was well placed on the inside, passed the half-mile pole under urging, saved ground on the far
turn and also faltered.

four wide down the backstretch and through the far turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. MONTEGO BAY

Footnotes
UNSTABLE PRINCE stumbled at the start, then got bumped by KENTUCKY JOKER due to pressure from MAGIA NERA and STOP THE SPREAD, chased
three wide through the first turn and down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, got going with seven-sixteenths to go when roused, came
under coaxing and advanced through the turn and angled seven wide into upper stretch, continued to rally surging to take command a sixteenth from home,
then edged clear to the finish kept to task. STREET SWAGG broke in at the start forcing PHILHARMONIC to steady in behind, established the front and
showed the way in hand just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive and was caught a sixteenth out, ran on to preserve the place honors. PROVE WORTHY coaxed from the gate when breaking a beat
slow, got coaxed along chasing three wide from the tail of the field, continued the prolonged encouragement through the turn and went seven to eight wide
into upper stretch, then kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. SOUTH STREET broke in a step at the start bumping SKI COUNTRY, chased two to
three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. SKI COUNTRY got bumped at the
start by the aforementioned foe, chased along the inside through the first turn and then four wide thereafter, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went
seven to eight wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. THANK YOU JON four wide through the first turn, chased two to three wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, continued two to three wide for home and weakened. KENTUCKY JOKER got bumped at the start by MAGIA NERA and in
turn bumped UNSTABLE PRINCE, then got steadied when pinched between those rivals, chased just off the inside through the first turn and then four to
five wide down the backstretch, came under coaxing three wide at the seven-sixteenths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. STOP
THE SPREAD hustled from the gate, came outwards forcing MAGIA NERA to shy out into KENTUCKY JOKER and in turn UNSTABLE PRINCE, raced just
off the inside through the first turn and then three to four wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path half a mile from home, swung four wide
into upper stretch and tired. MAGIA NERA shied out at the start bumping KENTUCKY JOKER into UNSTABLE PRINCE and pinching back that middle rival,
chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and tired.
PHILHARMONIC got steadied at the start when STREET SWAGG broke inwards directly in front, raced five then four wide through the first turn before
chasing four then three wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
STAR OF MYSTERY (GB) settled on the outside, was roused while two then three wide on the turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get
the lead inside the three-sixteenths pole, disposed of the runner-up into the final sixteenth and moved clear under steady handling. MANSA MUSA (IRE)
tracked the pace, was asked while moving from the inside to the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, led briefly near the three-sixteenths
pole then was headed by the winner, fought with that foe until near the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while clear for the place. FANDOM (GB) bumped
with a rival at the start, was reserved towards the rear, raced inside for most of the turn then moved to the two path, swung five wide into the stretch and
improved for the show. AMERICAN RASCAL settled on the outside near the rear, was roused while two then three wide on the turn, came six wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed kick. SMOKEY SMOKEY bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and lacked
the needed response. SET was hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, pursued
the top two into the final furlong and tired. NO NAY METS (IRE) broke out but was away fast then quickly sped clear, dropped from the two path to the rail
early on the turn, spun off the rail into the stretch then lost the advantage and gave way.

BARNSTORMING traded a bump at the start with OCTOBER BLISS, raced just off the inside through the first turn settling in mid pack, tucked to the rail
down the backstretch and continued inside through the far turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung three wide at the quarter pole and
tipped out to the five path with three-sixteenths remaining, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command and coming immediately
under threat to the outside a sixteenth out, dug in, the rider directing his charge outwards with a stiff right rein, brushed and herded out WRITE OFF JERRY
when knocking heads in the final jumps and just held on by a whisker to prevail. WRITE OFF JERRY coaxed from the gate, settled tracking the pace just off
the inside from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide at the quarter pole and then tipped out from in
behind VALUE ENGINEER to the seven path with three-sixteenths to go, rallied to issue a challenge nearing the sixteenth marker, had the aforementioned
foe get directed out and was brushed and leaned on and herded out half a path late and just missed at the end. BEARY FUNNY got carried four wide into
the first turn when BIG BIG STAR spun out three wide to his inside, chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down
angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to just take command inside the eighth pole, dug in under threat and was collared a sixteenth out, kept on to
preserve the show honors. YOUR MISSION got bumped at the start by VALUE ENGINEER, saved ground in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. BIG BIG STAR coaxed from the gate,
spun three wide into the first turn carrying out a trio, dueled from the two path in hand with LA MAQUINA to his inside, came under coaxing nearing the
quarter pole and swung three wide into upper stretch, seized sole command and dug in under threat yielding the front just inside the eighth pole, then
weakened in the late stages. BILLY'S GOT ISSUES three then two wide through the first turn, chased four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled ten wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the wire. DOWNING STREET coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coaxed along
from the get go, tipped three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
OCTOBER BLISS traded a bump at the start with BARNSTORMING, chased four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went eight wide into
upper stretch and offered no response. ERIC FROM MIAMI three wide through the first turn, chased four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. VALUE ENGINEER broke out at the start bumping YOUR MISSION, got carried four wide through
the first turn, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and tired. VINCE THE PRINCE got
carried five wide into the first turn, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and tired. LA
MAQUINA coaxed from the gate, dueled inside of BIG BIG STAR, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch yielding
the front straightened away and tired. There was a Stewards' Inquiry as well as a Claim of foul by the rider of WRITE OFF JERRY alleging interference in
deep stretch against BARNSTORMING. After review, it was deemed that BARNSTORMING has indeed interfered with WRITE OFF JERRY and
BARNSTORMING was disqualified from first and placed second prior to the result being declared official. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction
and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
