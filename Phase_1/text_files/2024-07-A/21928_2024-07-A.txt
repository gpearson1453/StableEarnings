Footnotes
MR MORRIS away well and raced to the lead while getting to the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of WHEN IN MEXICO in
the run down the backside, opened a clear advantage through the final turn, and continued to widen through the lane while under confident handling. PISCO
away alertly and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, shifted
off the rail leaving the turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to prove easily second best. WHEN IN MEXICO pressed the pace from the outside of
MR MORRIS entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide into the final turn, was no match for the top pair late, but finished from along the
rail in the drive to garner a share. QUATRE BAK broke sharply and tracked the dueling leaders in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering
the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon entering the lane. FRASER LANDING was slow into stride, and was rank while
running off behind rivals in the run to the first turn while on heels, trailed the field in the run down the backside, commenced his bid four wide entering the
final turn, but needed more when called upon leaving the turn. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of PISCO
lodged a claim of foul against the rider of MR MORRIS, for alleged interference approaching the first turn. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and
no change was made to the original order of finish.

JOSE JOSE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside, opened a clear
advantage into the final turn, and held TIME TICKER safely at bay late to prove best. TIME TICKER away well and stalked the early pace while racing two
wide into the backstretch, launched his bid two wide entering the final, and closed steadily three wide in the drive to prove second best while gaining late.
BAK TO LIBERTY tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, was no match
for the winner leaving the turn, and finished two wide in the drive to hold on for a share. DESIRED OUTCOME unhurried early while dropping back to trail,
rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest from along the rail in the drive. TAPITS CHOICE stalked the early pace while
saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive in an even effort.
SHURAZ broke sharply and tracked the leader into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, struggled to keep up in the run down the backstretch, and
had nothing to offer over the final furlong.

NINE OCLOCK CEASER away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and
into the final turn, maintained her advantage into the lane, and widened her advantage in the lane while being kept to task. JERSEY LILLIE broke sharply
and stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed
willingly three wide in the drive to hold on for the place. MISS THE HYPE settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest from along the inside in the drive to just miss the place.
DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, set sail after the leader two wide
entering the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on that rival entering the lane, and was outfinished late while racing three out from the rail. ROSE OF
TEXAS unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, rallied three wide from the back of the pack entering the final turn, and finished two wide
in the drive while unable to mount a serious bid. TOBESUNNY settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backside,
rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon.

ARISTOCRACY away well and eased off the dueling leaders to track the pacesetters two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, pressed the
leaders three wide in the run down the backside, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, and got the better of his stubborn pace rival late to prevail.
SLOOP JOHN B away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of BRIAN'S DE LEIGHT through the stretch the first time, forced the issue from
between rivals into the backstretch, took a narrow lead midway down the backside, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, and just missed following a
stretch long battle. PRINCE CAIRO stalked the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained a stalking
trip in the run down the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed one out from the rail in the drive to get up for a share.
LOGICAL AL stalked the dueling leaders into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the
backside, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to just miss the show spot. HIGHER IMAGE unhurried early
while dropping back to trail, bided her time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, launched her bid two wide from between rivals entering
the final turn, but needed more late while finishing five wide in the drive. BRIAN'S DE LEIGHT broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail
entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from the inside of SLOOP JOHN B into the backstretch, struggled to keep pace with that rival in the
run to the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

AT ATTENTION unhurried early while trailing the field into the stretch the first time, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch,
launched his bid five wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly four wide in the drive to be up in the final stride. SUNBIRD settled off the early
pace while racing three wide through the stretch the first time, advanced quickly from the outside midway down the backstretch, continued a four wide bid
through the final turn, took control entering the lane, and just failed to last. SPACE stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground
at the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to
grab a share in a solid effort. SETTECENTO settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the lane the first time, maintained his
position in the run down the backside, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly four out from the rail in the drive. BOLD
ARCH away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the
final turn, was overtaken by SUNBIRD entering the lane, and outfinished late. STORMY BLUE stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while
racing one out from the rail, maintained his position from between rivals in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and
finished from along the rail in the drive. BIG UNION broke sharply and stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time,
held his position in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed more in the late stages when called upon.
SOARINGFORTHESUN away alertly and stalked the pacesetter one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, struggled to keep his position in the
run to the final turn, raced two wide into the final turn but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. BAKKEN OVERDRIVE tracked the leader
through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, continued to chase the leader two wide into the final turn, but weakened over the final
furlong.

late. COBRA JET stalked the leaders into the first turn while racing two out from the rail, lost position in the run down the backside, saved ground into the
