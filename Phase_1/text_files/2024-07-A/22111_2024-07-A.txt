BIG HUG stalked the pace from the two path, inherited the lead, drew away in the final turn, and opened up through the stretch under light handling.
BURROW DOWN was reserved off the pacesetter while four wide, was no match for the winner late and held on for place. MINE ME stumbled leaving then
was brushed, was allowed to settle, and closed late to earn show. HIGHER IMAGE unhurried early, lodged a rail bid and gave way in the final sixteenth.
PLUM BLUE trailed throughout. MISSCZECH brushed gate then outside rival, took command early, was pulled up at the five-eighths pole, did not finish the
race and was transported off the track in the equine ambulance.

DARE TO COMPARE quickly went to the front, remained unchallenged nearing the quarter pole, responded to looming threat from BRYNN'S DREAM,
drifted out under left handed encouragement, and drove clear late. BRYNN'S DREAM saved ground inside, angled out four wide, loomed boldly at the head
of the stretch, but was unable to stall the winner and flattened. CROWN OF CAIRO raced wide early, shifted inside while two wide, was roused at the three
sixteenth pole, and improved position earning show. MIDNITE SCORE tracked three wide, lodged a bid at the quarter pole and flattened out. SIRACHA
broke alertly, sat in range while five wide, and passed tiring rivals. WE THE FRINGE stalked the pace while four wide, dropped back in the final turn and
gave way. MWIBA offered little. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of BRYNN'S DREAM against the rider of DARE TO COMPARE
alleging interference in the stretch was not allowed.

WRONG SPOT hesitated at the start then was gapped early, gained closer order leaving the backstretch, angled outside nearing the stretch drive, and won
driving. VIATURE took closer ordering nearing the quarter pole, swung out four to five wide, and was outkicked under urging. SIMPLY WICKED contested
the early pace outside, of A MAN'S MAN, dueled through the final turn, and just held on for show. ESTIFRAAD saved ground inside, lodged a rail bid into
the stretch and evened out late. A MAN'S MAN pressured the early pace from the two path, dueled through the final turn and weakened late.
ROCKTILLYOUDROP raced wide from the second flight, and failed to menace. CAB SAV went four wide into the opening turn, and came up empty in the
drive. HALLISAR stalked the pace from the five path, was unable to move with the field and stopped.

VARATTI saved ground inside, angled four wide at the quarter pole, gained the lead into the stretch, drifted out late stretch and prevailed under a drive.
DECOY raced wide in the backstretch, brushed leaving the backstretch, was guided out of traffic, rallied wide into the lane, closed steadily and dug in late to
score place. GREAT ESCAPE fanned four wide, stalked the pace four wide in the backstretch, encountered traffic leaving the backstretch, went wide
through the final turn, closed steadily outside and steadied in the final strides. SILENT RUNNER showed early speed, fanned four wide in the opening turn,
stalked the pace while three to four wide, brushed FOUR O SIX CREED in the far turn, rallied inside at the head of the lane, and flattened late stretch.
RIVERSIDE trailed through the opening turn, raced wide through the backstretch, angled in brushing SILENT RUNNER, rallied between foes and weakened
late. AMERICAN BLAZE hit gate before the break, was unhurried early, carried wide into traffic on the final turn, and offered a late bid. FOUR O SIX CREED
stalked the pace while three wide, was in tight in the far turn then was shuffled back, and faded in the sixteenth. UNCHARACTERISTIC saved inside, lost
path at the head of the lane amidst close quarters, and came up empty in the drive. GLAVA emerged the leader leaving the opening turn, showed the way
under a snug hold, was overtaken nearing the quarter pole, shifted out sharply into foes and stopped. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an
inquiry into the later stages of the stretch involving VARATTI and GREAT ESCAPE. After a review of the film, the Stewards determined that VARATTI
caused interference to GREAT ESCAPE. VARATTI was disqualified from first and placed third.

Footnotes
DERZKII rated well of the pace inside, shifted out five wide, and surged in the finals yards, got up. KYSTONE allowed to settle inside early, set sights on the
leader at the quarter pole, gained an advantage at the sixteenth pole, and was nipped at the wire. ATTENZIONE was roused at the quarter pole, closed
steadily and weakened in the final yards. EL NOBLE raced in closest pursuit, drove three wide into the lane, and flattened out. QUINTO SOL sped to the
front, held good margins through the backstretch, saw margins diminish nearing the quarter pole, showed signs of tiring into the stretch, and gave way
grudgingly late. BODEMONSTER raced two wide, swung out at the head of the lane, and bid belatedly. PARKING PERMIT lacked serious bid.
COUNTRIFIED tracked four wide, and was roused to no avail. ALL RUN showed little. H K RAPPER settled outside and tired.
