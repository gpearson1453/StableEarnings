pace, gained ground on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE was unhurried early,
raced evenly on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for show. FIFTH SEASON was in touch and roused on the far turn but
from the three path at the top of the stretch had no response. SAME AGAIN DOC showed speed from the inside but lost ground on the far turn, was eased
to the wire and walked off. PER STEWARDS RULING, GLORIOUS TRIBUTE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND DEEMED UNPLACED

SILVER CANDICE tracked the early leaders, was a factor on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch drew clear. FOREST B set a pressured
pace and had a slim lead on the turn but was no match for the winner. CANT BEAT THE KATZ forced the pace and dueled on the turn but from the four
path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. PLUIE D'AVRIL was off the pace and hustled along on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch
was no real threat. SPIRIT BELLE was off slow and showed little in a dull effort.

turn and had a mild bid in mid stretch while all out. SPRING HIGH was unhurried early, had a mild gain on the turn and from the four path at the top of the
stretch finished evenly. MISS SCHILLER was off the pace, checked going into the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch had no rally. EASY
ACCESS had no speed and saved ground on the turn but was never a threat. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON SPRING HIGH AGAINST SILVER

good position on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. AUTUMN'S SO FLASHY showed speed from the inside and had a slim
lead on the turn but gave way at the top of the stretch. GARGAS was in range and hustled along on the turn but from the eight path at the top of the stretch
leveled off. YOU SEE ME was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. BEST AND FINAL

and had a mild gain on the turn but needed more. JAMAICAN JIMMY was unhurried early and moved up on the turn but from the six path at the top of the
stretch finished evenly. EXCEED was in touch and roused on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. GREAT GO GO
