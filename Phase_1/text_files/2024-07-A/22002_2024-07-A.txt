COLLECTOR was reserved early, advanced on the turn and was six wide by the quarter pole, came widest into the lane and was along for the show award.
TUFF CONSTITUTION was well rated early, then waited behind the vying leaders in front of him two to three wide leaving the quarter pole, then was in
traffic by the furlong marker and split rivals nearing the sixteenth marker and improved position late. MEMORY BOUQUET prompted the pace on the
outside and made a four wide bid on the turn but weakened in the final furlong. POINT PELEE vied for the lead three wide, then was in between rivals by
the quarter pole and weakened in the final furlong. GRAB THE GOLD vied for the lead on the inside and weakened. LOST IN NEWYORK vied for the lead
in between rivals and faltered in the lane.

Footnotes
KAZ SUGAR BANK was well rated early, then was coaxed along on the turn and ranged up four wide leaving the turn and closed well to get up late and
edged clear to prove best under a drive. JAMIE DREAMS set a pressured pace on the inside, then dueled for lead on the far turn, came two wide off the
turn and dug in gamely, fought on to the wire but could not go with the winner in the last fifty yards while being second best. CURLINGTON was allowed to
settle early, made a inside rally leaving the turn but needed more while gaining the show award. AMUSING MISCHIEF pressed the early pace and then
went up to duel for command and made a three wide bid leaving the turn to gain a short lead by the furlong marker but hung late and lost the show award.
WILL E SUTTON was off slowly and settled back early and had no response. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using
video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

ran on willingly on the inside to be clearly second best. LADYNESS chased the pace on the inside and angled off the inside in the lane and had a mild late
kick to clearly best the rest. MASKED HEROINE chased the pace in between rivals two wide and weakened. ESTA CHUCK chased the pace four wide and
came five wide into the lane and weakened. MOONLITE IN HEAVEN was settled early between rivals by the half mile marker and dropped back while being

Footnotes
FORCEZILLA prompted the pace on the outside and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole and went on even terms for command nearing the furlong
marker and then edged away to prove best under a drive. SAVE THE MISCHIEF set a pressured pace two wide and in between rivals on the turn and then
was out-kicked in the final furlong while staying on to be second best. LADY GABRIELLE was bumped at the start, pressed the pace on the inside and then
faded in the final furlong, held show award. ZIFFY BUG was close up early on the inside and had to steady by the half mile marker and fell back, then
moved out on the turn and came four wide into the lane and had a mild late kick. MOST UNUSUAL DAY tracked the pace and was two to three wide on the
turn, and then faded in the final furlong. TIME OF OUR LIVES was settled early, between rivals by the five sixteenths and had no rally. TRACE MARTINIS
was settled early and three to four wide on the turn and was not a threat.
