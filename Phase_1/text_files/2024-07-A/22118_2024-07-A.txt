Footnotes
THEE NEW BEGINNING got sent from the gate to set an open pace in the two path entering the turn, opened up under a nudge while just off the rail
rounding the turn, tipped out to the four path turning into the lane, and stayed on to hold sway. SWEET RUN bumped an inner foe twice at the start, rated in
the two path early before receiving a right handed cue entering the turn, angled out midway around the turn, floated out to the seven path entering the
stretch, and ran on for place. BALALA stalked inside, came under a ride going into the turn, swung out to the four path at the top of the lane, and kept on for
show. CAJUN PRIME was hustled from in range in the five path, lost ground under coaxing around the turn, but finished evenly from the seven path in the
stretch. WIDERTHANAMILE raced off the pace in the five path, was ridden around the turn, floated out to the nine path turning into the lane, and stayed on
but failed to bid. STUBOLD got bumped twice by an outer foe at the start, trailed inside early, moved up inside of foes turning into the lane, but flattened on
her left in the final furlong. BLINGING BURR chased in the three path but did not threaten. RANCHO VISTA prompted the pace in the three path but
weakened down the lane. IGNITING THE FLAME raced in midpack outside of foes in the seven path, but drifted out leaving the turn, and failed to menace.

OURS FOR SURE set the pace in the two path and edged clear under a drive. SULTAN THE GREAT pressed the winner in the three path but was
outfinished by that foe while holding clear of the rest. BIVOL had early speed two wide, chased the top two two and three wide around the turn and kept on
for the show with threatening. BOY O' BOY chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. MR. RHODIUM failed to menace while racing four and
five wide. HOPE YOU DANCE trailed in the three path.

Footnotes
VLADISLAV tracked in the three path, was coaxed from the two path passing the three-eighths, cut the corner turning into the lane, and kicked on to inch
ahead of an outer foe in the final sixteenth. THOUGHT laid up close in the four path, bid under coaxing from the three path rounding the far turn, swept to
the lead in the four path at the top of the stretch, angled in while staying on in an attempt to fend off an inner foe entering the final furlong, but was caught
late to place. SOCIALLONGDISTANCE got a bit keen around the first turn and stalked in the five path down the backstretch, was ridden in the four path
around the far turn, swung from the five path into the lane, and kept on for show. THE MAR rated in the four path, was coaxed along the inside around the
far turn, but made no impact. MR CROWLEY set the pace in the three path, was roused from the two path early around the far turn, fought on while losing
the lead in the three path down the stretch, but had to steady late. SIR SAFFER trailed throughout.

UNCHAINED ELAINE set the pace in the two path, drifted out through the stretch and held firm. THANKFULLY pressed the winner in the three path, was
carried out a bit by that foe in the lane, kept trying throughout but was unable to get by. MY DENYSSE raced off the pace two and three wide and rallied for
the show. MARABINA raced three wide in midpack and lacked the needed rally. ALTAMIRA SUR raced off the pace two wide and never threatened. LE
TOUCHE failed to menace while racing four and five wide. SOLIDARIA chased the pace inside and retreated through the lane. BRENNA played no factor
while racing three wide. GULFSTREAM MARY D was outrun while racing two wide. PRINCESS KRIS trailed inside. THE BEACH GOES ON ducked in not
long after the start, lost the rider and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO BOTH THE START AND THE STRETCH BUT TOOK

Footnotes
U LITE UP MY LIFE set the pace along the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane and drew off under left-handed urging. GULLFAXI lacked early speed,
advanced down the backstretch, pressed the winner two wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and was clearly second best. JAYANA
tracked the pace three wide, lacked a closing bid and bested the rest. GROUND STOP played no factor while racing four wide. HARD SPICE was outrun
while racing three wide.

Footnotes
PLATINUM ROCKER set the pace in the two path, was roused midway around the far turn, tipped out to the three path at the top of the lane, and dug in
gamely to hold off challengers on both sides for the win. MISS HOLLY rated in the five path, ranged up in the four path midway around the far turn, angled
to the rail turning into the stretch, ran on to bid passing the eighth pole, but was denied by the game outer pacesetter to place. LOVE RHAPSODY threw her
head as the gates opened and had a slow start, trailed in the four path down the backstretch, moved up under coaxing in the five path rounding the far turn,
took aim at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. BELLWETHER laid up close in the three path, was roused into the far turn, but faded in the stretch.
HEAVENS EXPRESS broke out at the start, tracked in the four path, was ridden between foes in the three path midway around the far turn, but flattened in
the stretch. ANONYMOUS SOURCE raced off the pace in the three path, floated out to the six path turning into the stretch, and never threatened. D CITY
GIRL stalked in the two path but was empty entering the lane.
