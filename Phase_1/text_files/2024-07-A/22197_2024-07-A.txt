Footnotes
BEIRUT BEAUTY crowded briefly at the start, commenced her bid outside rivals after two furlongs, was forced out some upper stretch, soon vied for the
lead, gradually edged ahead inside the last furlong, drifted out under left-handed pressure inside the sixteenth marker, was straightened nearing the wire
and held sway. COOKIN ROSES broke alertly then stumbled a few strides from the gate, quickly recovered, was hustled to a clear lead, showed the way
just off the inside, drifted out into the lane and briefly upper stretch, was corrected, all out between rivals but did not have enough left in the late going.
TAPICITA unruly in the gate, was settled at the back and along the rail, picked up her pace on the turn and rallied belatedly in the lane. LIFE OF
SATURDAYS chased just outside COOKIN ROSES, reached contention on the bend, was forced out by the latter into the stretch, steadied briefly as her
path narrowed, came again between rivals midstretch then leveled off in the waning yards.

LORD ZEKE stalked the early speed from outside, took over on the bend, drifted out leaving the turn and through upper stretch, held a straight path the final
furlong and proved clearly the best. CARNACK ON TOUR raced in contention between horses, advanced behind LORD ZEKE on the bend, altered out to
stay outside the latter into the lane and upper stretch, battled for second, lugged in some inside the final furlong and edged ahead for the place. LELAND
JOHN was sent to get a clear lead after the first eighth, was challenged from outside after a quarter mile, just off the rail through the turn, fought to keep the
place in the stretch but did not have enough late. PLAY THE BLUES hesitated at the start, was soon well back and well off the inside, lost ground widest
taking the bend, also altered out for a clear path into the stretch, altered in some with a furlong to go, altered out when his path was taken by CARNACK ON
TOUR inside the last eighth and finished evenly. HALF THE BATTLE was hustled to dispute the pace briefly, did not keep up after travelling the first eighth,
saved ground through the turn, had a striking position midstretch but leveled off instead. MARK'S BUDDY JACIN chased from between horses, faded to the
rear on the bend and had little to offer for the drive. The rider of PLAY THE BLUES lodged an objection alleging interference from CARNACK ON TOUR
inside the last furlong. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that claim of foul.

REBA ATTACK shared the early lead from inside, did not stay with TINA'S TAPIZAR after a quarter mile, angled out some, was roused leaving the bend,
moved clear from path four upper stretch and maintained control under steady handling. VASARIAH'S IMAGE rated from outside, angled in on the turn,
rallied belatedly in the lane but caught TINA'S TAPIZAR for second with seventy yards to go. TINA'S TAPIZAR vied for the early lead from outside, edged
ahead nearing the end of two furlongs, drew clear and and angled in some soon after, floated out to path three into the stretch and gradually wore down
between rivals. PEYTONS HONOR prominent just off the rail, also angled out after a quarter mile, lost ground widest through the turn and could only make
up minor ground the last eighth. LUTION well back early, stayed off the inside taking the bend, angled out widest upper stretch then surged belatedly the
final furlong.

HIGHLY PERFECT was sent to a clear early lead, was challenged from inside midway on the backstretch, edged ahead leaving the bend, floated out to
path five, drew clear under urging and maintained full control. MAMAS FIRE forwardly placed running widest, lost ground staying outside rivals through the
turn, rallied the last furlong, was too late but took over second with a sixteenth left. EMPTY HOLSTER was bumped from the rear at the break, raced in
contention from inside, gradually swung out taking the bend, came into the lane from path four, had a striking position with a furlong to go but leveled off
instead. FAST CROSS TRAFFIC broke inward, bumping EMPTY HOLSTER, was hustled up between rivals to vie for the lead nearing the end of two
furlongs, also floated out some into the lane and began to flatten out.

BOISE was sent to vied for the lead outside TAPIT SAM, moved clear after two furlongs, angled in some, was challenged from outside on the turn, battled
between rivals the last furlong, dug in and kept TAPIT SAM at bay. TAPIT SAM contested the pace from inside, did not stay with BOISE after a quarter mile,
was steadied while boxed in into the bend, came again from inside to duel for the lead inside the final eighth, fought gamely but had to settle for second
best. MODAZZLE progressed from outside to vie for the lead on the turn and through upper stretch but began to wear down inside the last furlong.

Footnotes
RONAN forwardly placed inside, waited for room on the turn, got through while still along the inside into the stretch and gradually edged ahead inside the
last eighth. MISS DUTTON vied for the lead outside DIXIE PENNY, battled through the stretch, could not hold back RONAN inside the final furlong and
bumped or brushed with DIXIE PENNY several times the final sixteenth. DIXIE PENNY broke alertly, was soon challenged from outside, had the rail on the
turn, floated out some into the lane, fought between rivals to hold on, bumped or brushed with MISS DUTTON the last sixteenth and lacked the extra
needed in the waning yards. MYSWEETANNALYZE progressed behind MISS DUTTON on the bend, fanned outside that one for the stretch run and began
to flatten out. BLAME TERI unruly in the gate, dwelt at the break, stayed well off the inside and was never a factor. There was a stewards' inquiry into
BLAME TERI'S start but no action was taken as it was determined BLAME TERI was prepared to leave the gate with the rest but chose not to.

BETTY'S SECRET a step slow at the break, was hustled up off the rail but inside rivals to edge ahead for the lead after the first furlong, stayed just off the
inside taking the turn, was roused upper stretch, lengthened command and held sway under steady handling. JAMAICAN TRAFFIC moved to the inside
early on, steadily progressed along the rail once on the bend, took over second inside the final eighth but could not close the gap on the leader in the late
going. KALL KAT prominent just off the inside, moved clear for second behind BETTY'S SECRET on the turn, fanned outside that one for the stretch run
and slowly wore down the last furlong. MISS MIA was away slowly, trailed just off the inside, picked up her pace along the rail on the turn, angled outside
KALL KAT upper stretch, drifted out a bit further, improved position then leveled off the final furlong. HALLIE'S RAINBOW broke inward, bumping LORI
ATTACK, raced in contention from outside but faded widest on the bend. LORI ATTACK bumped at the break, was a factor just inside HALLIE'S RAINBOW
on the backstretch but also began to yield after three furlongs. CAT TALE BREEZE chased running widest on the backstretch, was just off the inside taking
the turn, swung out some for the drive and had little to offer. FILLY FROM ILLY broke alertly, was overtaken from inside after travelling the first eighth and
gave way between rivals the last quarter mile.
