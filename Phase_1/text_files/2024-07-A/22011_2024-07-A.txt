Footnotes
CAUGHT OFF GUARD reared up leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the firs turn, moved up to stalk the leaders on the outside racing up the
backstretch, came around the far turn in the four path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and kicked clear. STAR MISSION raced in the two path early,
settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the second bend, began a bid entering the stretch,
dueled in the lane and chased the winner home late. COWBOY CAUSE bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, raced off the pace on the inside
through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground in late stretch while drifting
mildly. WILD TIME saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside racing up the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around
the second bend, then came on again in the lane to make up some ground through the final furlong. BACK TO SELLING raced in the three path early,
tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and weakened in the lane. CLEARWATER SUNSET bumped
with the horse to his outside at the start, raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the
far turn still in the three path and made no bid. SHOTCRETE raced in the two path around the first bend, pressed the pace on the outside up the
backstretch, came around the second turn in the three path and faded from there. NAVE saved ground around the first turn, led the way on the inside up the
backstretch, dueled from the rail around the far turn and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
SENSICAL stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, challenged nearing the quarter pole and drew off in
the stretch. FLASH HUMOR led the way between horses through the opening quarter, navigated the bend from the two path, dueled in upper stretch, was
caught with a furlong to go and chased on from there. TELL 'EM I'M COMIN veered in leaving the gate, trailed the field early, continued around the turn in
the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and improved position in the lane. BAY BOSS chased the leader between horses up the backstretch,
raced in the three path around the turn and weakened in the stretch. PALACE ATTAINED chased the pace setters on the inside up the backstretch, saved
ground around the bend and faded in the lane. JET STREAM raced off the pace through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the three path and
made no bid. BABY NOVA tracked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch.
