Footnotes
PUDD'N N PIE rated close up and to the inside of rival, eased out for room mid turn then moved up to take aim outside the leader, engaged that one soon
into the lane, dueled on a slim lead from the furlong ground and dug in under solid handling to prevail. BEATIFUL KARLA came in a bit at the break,
corrected and sped clear, set the pace towards the inner rail, dug in when confronted in upper stretch, battled valiantly inside the winner and missed.
PEPPERMINT CLASS bobbled slightly at the break, regrouped and rated off the inside, steadied nearing the turn, shifted in and made a rail advance into
the stretch, eased out and gave wiling chase to the wire. MADDIE TEN , in a bit tight at the break, pulled her way forward behind foes, eased out leaving the
far turn, chased, lacked a kick into the stretch and faded. PRIZE DEBATE prompted the pace outside the leader, was under pressure mid turn and
weakened. STORM RATE , three to four wide, gave way.

Footnotes
MAGIC IN THE PARK saved ground around the first turn, stalked the pace in hand down the backstretch, advanced in the two path between horses to
secure command approaching the stretch and eagerly pulled away with something in reserve. DEAD SEXY bore out leaving the starting gate, hugged the
inner rail the first turn, raced forwardly inside horses on the far turn, remained inside foes in the lane and gained the place. STEAM KNOT saved ground
around the first turn, was well placed leaving the backstretch, swung to the four path at the head of the stretch, failed rally and passed a tired rival late.
SAINT DEVEREAUX advanced three deep to reach contention leaving the far turn, chased the winner in the stretch and tired the final furlong. JET SPIN
came in at the break, was outrun and turned for home in the three path. MARGARET P , pinched back leaving the starting gate, was outrun. HEAVENLY
CIELLA sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and faltered.

Footnotes
MORNING THOUGHTS , away in good order, took over three wide outside foes into the first turn, cleared and dropped in towards the rail to set a rated
pace, remained in control as rivals behind him were under a solid drive past the five sixteenths, responded to firm asking soon into the lane, steadily
widened and was kept alert to the wire. ZOOMER , fractious in the gate, saved ground advancing to the half, was under a strong ride pursuing past the
three eighths, eased out a bit into the stretch, then came back on to the inside of TRASH TALKIN LARRY to gamely nab the place. TRASH TALKIN LARRY
lost ground four wide into and around the first turn, remained wide when edging up past the five eighths, was under asking as the closest pursuer into the
stretch, remained clear of others past the furlong grounds, flattened out late and lost the place. GAMBLING TZAR , two wide between foes nearing the
backstretch, steadied soon after, saved ground leaving the far turn but lacked a rally. SHIVAREE had speed then was rated back off the winner nearing the
seven eighths, stalked two wide and between foes nearing the far turn, lacked a punch past the three eighths and weakened. FORTUNE'S FOOL , forward
into the first turn, raced three wide between runners past the three quarter pole, dropped in a bit nearing the half, faltered and was eased late.

Footnotes
SELF CONFIDENT saved ground around the first turn, remained along the inner rail stalking the pace down the backstretch and into the far turn, eased out
to the three path approaching the stretch, bid for the lead inside the eighth pole and gamely prevailed between horses. NINJA ABARRIO , never far back
outside rivals, floated four deep at the head of the stretch and rallied outside the winner. JUNIPER JUICE prompted the pace outside WARIDI CANDY, over
took that one in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly late. NICOLAR lacked speed, circled horses the far turn, floated six wide in upper stretch and closed
late outside rivals. HIT THE ROAD BRAT came in while rank approaching the first turn, raced inside horses, offered a mild move along the inner rail in mid
stretch then weakened. DOWNTOWN KATIE , never a factor, swung to the five path in upper stretch. DETERMIND PRINCESS , checked when forced back
by HIT THE ROAD BRAT approaching the first turn, was outrun. WARIDI CANDY sped to the front, set the pace along the inner rail and faltered in upper
stretch.

AT FIRST SIGHT , rank at the break, quickly reached a stalking spot three wide, moved up outside and engaged the leader leaving the far turn, sparred
under rating past the five sixteenths, responded when put to firm asking entering the stretch, shook clear leaving the three sixteenths then steadily widened
under a drive. SOUTH PACIFIC rated four wide early on, gained outside foes leaving the far turn, loomed chasing four wide into the stretch, churned on
willingly through the final furlong and wore down MOLLY OF STRATFORD to gain the place. MOLLY OF STRATFORD sped to the front, set the pace
towards the inner rail, dueled with the winner from the three eighths to upper stretch, stayed willingly past the sixteenth marker then weakened late.
LOOKING FOR WATER , brushed at the break, raced well off the early pace, steadied briefly into the turn, regrouped to save ground mid turn, worked
outward in the final furlong and kept on with some interest. SEARCH , off the pace, raced between foes exiting the far turn, swung out five to six wide for the
drive and offered a belated response. CHAMPAGNE DANCE broke inward, straightened and secured the rail early on, pulled her way forward leaving the
far turn, had aim on the dueling leaders past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on nearing mid stretch and faded. FUNZALO , forced in at the break brushing
with LOOKING FOR WATER, raced three deep past the half, shifted out some and offered some effort between rivals. GOOD STORY , off slowly, saved
ground and failed to menace. SUN STREAMING lagged back, raced well wide for the drive and failed to threaten. JOB'S NOT FINISHED prompted the
pace outside the leader, failed to kick on under pressure after a half and faded.

Footnotes
SIR LONDON stalked the pace along the inner rail, eased out three wide leaving the far turn, took the lead approaching the eighth pole and determinedly
prevailed. CRISPER lacked speed, saved ground around the first turn, remained well off the pace for six furlongs, angled out and closed between horses.
STORM THE COURT circled horses on the far turn, floated to the four path turning for home and rallied outside. GRATEFUL BRED , never far back, failed
to rally. WISH ME HOME prompted the pace outside WHERE'S RAY, gained a short lead entering the stretch then faltered near the sixteenth pole.
STREET COPPER , never a factor, raced along the inner rail the far turn and in the stretch. WICKED PRANKSTER stalked the pace and gave way.
WHERE'S RAY set the pace along the inner rail and faltered in mid stretch. MINISTER FOR MAGIC was outrun.

Footnotes
BRILLIANT ICE was nudged to the front then dropped in to secure the inside, turned away outer threats leaving the three quarter pole and spurted clear,
dictated the pace under confident handling around the turn, responded when given his cue in upper stretch and eagerly opened up, was kept alert with a
couple of right hand asks near mid stretch then maintained a comfortable advantage while steadily hand ridden the final seventy yards. ARMANDO R was
steadied back from between rivals leaving the chute, angled in and lagged off the pace, saved ground into the lane, eased out, worked between runners
inside the final furlong and kept on willingly to gain the place. IT'S VIPER , brushed at the break, saved ground off the pace, angled four to five wide for the
drive and churned on. EXCELLORATOR moved up two wide between rivals and briefly bid near the thee quarters, was rebuffed by the winner then stalked,
came under a hustling ride mid turn, stayed on willingly past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. UNINVITED GUEST , brushed at the break, saved
ground and faded. YOUR ANALYSIS , brushed at the start, raced three wide between foes with an early challenge, remained three wide leaving the far turn,
was under a hearty ride past the three eighths, circled three to four wide into the lane then weakened. MARTINI MARTIN , with the early pace four deep,
dropped back entering the far turn then came up empty.

drove clear late. PRINCE KHOZAN , kept outside horses throughout, circled the far turn and entered the stretch three wide, gained a brief lead inside the

caught in traffic in mid stretch and finished willingly. GUAPONESS stalked the pace down the backstretch, gained a two wide lead on the far turn and tired
late. BAIL OUT , three wide the far turn, failed to rally. SUPER E stayed along the inner rail down the backstretch, angled out in upper stretch and passed
tired horses. DAREDAVITE was outrun. JACKIE A , wide the far turn, was not a factor. THE BEST DISTANCE set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead
on the far turn and faltered. CAERUS , a forward factor along the inner rail down the backstretch, checked on heels entering the far turn then dropped back.
