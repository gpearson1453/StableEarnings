ADOGATE was away well to stalk the pace from the three path into the turn, moved up to tip by the pace setter when asked and drew clear in the late
stretch while in a strong drive to prevail. AFFECTION was forced inward and bumped foe, stalked while two wide, continued to chased the leaders on the
turn from the inside, shifted three wide in the upper stretch to rally bid and was up for the place position. JUST A SIP hustled along the rail to lead the way
leaving the nine sixteenths pole, maintained a steady hand ride while being pressed by an outer foe on the turn then faltered in the stretch. CITY GHOST
was unhurried early, bid three wide leaving the bend, was bumped, then kept on and never threatened. DULCE AMANECER YG was unhurried early and
passed tired rival in the stretch. STHENIC was forced outwardly by an inner foe and bumped another at the start, settled inside close behind the leaders,
drifted out four wide leaving the bend while rallying bid, bumped foe then gave way.

EL QUESO GRANDE was allowed to settle at the tail of the field, circled field four to five wide leaving the bend and closed well down the lane to be up just
in time to claim victory. CLASSIC RICK stalked the dueling pair while three wide, then gain command at the quarter under steady coaxing, was in an all out
drive while drifting out in the late stretch then was caught by an outer foe and was second best. FLOTATION STATION dueled with an inner rival into the
turn, was out bid for the lead by an outer foe heading into the stretch, kept on while menacing gamely and was best for the show position. LUCKYTABUCKY
chased the pace while two wide, then rallied bid on the far turn and kept on down the lane while in a mild drive just missing the show position. LAST
ATTACK broke inwardly and bumped, then duel with an outer foe into the turn, was overtaken by a third counterpart at the quarter pole and gave way in the
lane. HOLUS BOLUS was bumped at the start, then bid for the lead briefly from the inside and lacked rallying after the turn.

KENNEL CLUB was reserved at the back early, rallied bid leaving the turn while three wide, then surged down the lane while passing foes and was up in
time to prevail. TAP DANCE TANGO was brushed at the start, then prompted the pace while two wide, continued to press the leader on the turn while
coaxing steadily, dug in gamely in the early stretch to gain command in the final sixteenth then was out finished by an inner foe and was second best.
TRAVIS broke outwardly and brushed rival, saved ground at towards the back, rallied bid coming off the turn while three wide and closed well for the show
winnings. I AM ON THE LIST was allowed to settle along the rail at a moderate pace, then rallied a mild bid in the late stretch but it was not enough.
MITOLE'S LIMIT pursued the pace while two wide, then steadied early, came out four to five wide leaving the turn to rally in the stretch but it was too little
too late. GET RIPPED set the pace from the inside, was in a long drive leaving the turn while being pressed by an outer foe, then faltered in the late stretch.

prove much the best. UBSINGINTHEBLUES was impeded at the start, then chased the pace from the inside and in third position, rallied bid leaving coming
off the turn while four wide, could never catch the leader and was up for the place position. UPTOWN TWOUNDERPAR broke outwardly and bumped foe,
was allowed to settle inside, rallied bid in the stretch but it was too little to catch the leader and was enough to claim the show winnings. CANDY BINDER
drifted inwardly at the start, was allowed to settle at the back while two wide, rallied a mild bid in the late stretch and came up empty.
SHAKINTHEMONARCHY never threatened. VIGILANT STORM sped to the front to show the way from the inside, was overtaken by an outer foe heading
into the stretch, was in an all out drive while pursing the clearing leader, lost crop in the late stretch and gave way. MYTURNTODEAL failed to rally.
TRAVEL GURU veered outwardly then was pinched back at the start and was no factor. ALPHABET ADAMS was no menace.

Footnotes
H V XTRA WILD HEAT stalked the pace from the inside in hand, was set down in the upper stretch to go shoulder to shoulder with TEXAN FARMER in the
final yards and was up in time to prevail. TEXAN FARMER chased the pace while four wide, then moved up to press from the two path on the turn, dug in
gamely to duel with an inner foe in the late stretch and just missed victory. JUST HANGIN RIDGE broke inwardly and bumped foe, then showed the way
while three wide, was pressed by outer foes while maintaining the lead along the rail in the turn, could not retain bid in the upper stretch and gave way.
FANDO was brushed at the start, stalked from the inside, then dropped back slightly heading into the turn, rallied bid heading in the stretch and needed
more. SAMSPLAYERSLOUNGE was bumped at the start, then chased the pace while three wide and between rivals, was in tight heading into the turn,
steadied, re bid in the upper stretch while coming out seven wide but it was not enough. WITT'S JERRY chased while five wide, continued to prompt the
pace on the turn while three wide then lacked the needed response in the late stretch. RICHARD'S TX BLING was unhurried early and no threat.
CAPTAINS COVE was bumped by an outer foe then was shuffled back at the start and was no menace. RUSTY GADGET was bumped then cut off at the
start, then moved up from the back while four wide to contended briefly with inner foes then weakened in the stretch. ALL MIGHT drifted outwardly shortly
after the start and cut off foes and never threatened.

Footnotes
BALSA established the pace while two wide, was in a steady hand ride while being pursued by rivals on the turn then drew off in the stretch to prove clearly
the best. RANCH BADGE drifted in shortly after the start, then chased the pace from the inside, split rivals heading into the turn to gain second position, was
no match for the leader and dueled for the place prize and was up at the wire. PUTMAN pressed the pace from the inside, continued to stalk on the turn,
then menaced in the early stretch to duel for the place position down the lane and just missed. UNCLE BERLEY was bumped shortly after the start, was
allowed to settle along the inside, then rallied bid leaving the turn while four wide and was no threat. DUDE PERFECTA saved ground while racing mid pack
along the rail, then rallied a mild bid in the late stretch to no avail. BLOCKED chased while two wide, bid on the turn and lacked rallying in the stretch. BIG
WAVE JAMES was forced inwardly by a drifting foe at the start and was no menace. CAPTAIN JACK bumped outer foe shortly after the start and was no
factor.

Footnotes
CATHOLIC GUILT tracked the pace from the inside while being well rated, came under coaxing leaving the far turn to edge past the pace setter while two
wide, gained command in the upper stretch then held on well to the wire to prevail. REQUISITION set the pace from the inside, was in long drive on the far
turn, was overtaken for the lead by an outer foe heading in the stretch and held onto the place position. TURN ON THE MAGIC tracked the pace from the
two path in the early furlongs, then rallied bid on the far turn while three wide and into the stretch, needed more and maintained the show place.
DREWPOWER was unhurried early, then moved up along the inside on the far turn, rallied a mild bid in the late stretch and just missed the show prize in
the end. WILLY THE COBBLER was no threat. DESOTO'S WAR was no menace. GUITAR SLIM broke outwardly and was no factor. GOLD MONEY failed
to rally.

UP UP AND AWAY laid off the pace while four wide, then moved up to the two path and was steadily gaining ground on the turn, edged past the pace setter
in the early stretch and drew clear to prevail. EXPECT GLORY sparred with an inner foe down the backstretch, then gain command on the turn, was in a
long drive in the early stretch then was out finished by an outer foe and was second best. SILENT BLING was cut off at the start, was unhurried early, then
moved up on the turn while three wide to rally a mild bid in the early stretch to get up for the show place. IHAVETOOMUCHAIR was no threat. OBVIOUS
CONCLUSION dueled from the inside down the backstretch and into the turn, could no retain bid and gave way in the remaining furlongs. VALOBRA
chased the pace while three wide early, then settled back, rallied a mild on the turn while three wide and never threatened. MORO TRENDSETTER veered
outwardly and was no factor. BAYOU BOY was no threat. LEONARDO CREED was no factor. TITO was rank early and no rally. GOLDEN PURSUIT
pursued the pace from the inside early then failed to rally leaving the backstretch.

inched away to spar grudgingly with MOON CAT in the final yards and was up at the wire. MOON CAT tracked the pace while two wide in the early furlongs,
moved up on the far turn while three wide to vie with inner foes in the early stretch, continued to dig in gamely to pull away and duel with UNCLE HAPPY in
the final yards and hung at the wire. SOLID COUNTRY GOLD was allowed to settle between rivals towards the back, then moved up along the rail on the
turn while in a steady drive, rallied bid in the late stretch and was closing in on the dueling pair and was best for third. FIGHT'N READY was allowed to settle
while three wide at the back, then moved up briskly to rally bid while four wide on the far turn, then kept on down the lane while in a strong drive. SARA'S
SHAMAN established the pace from the inside, was in a long drive leaving the far turn while being pressed by outer foes, vied gamely in the upper stretch

trailed settled at the back and trailed early, bid mildly in the late stretch and never threatened . OPTIMUS KAT raced mid pack while three wide, then bid
while two wide in the upper stretch and made no impact . TITLE CONTENDER was no menace . ONE LAST BID raced mid pack along the rail and never
