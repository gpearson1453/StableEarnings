inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and weakened in the lane. BY DECREED dropped back quickly in the opening stages to trail the

C C'S HEART raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming around the far turn,
kicked clear and held that margin to the wire. MARK OF VICTORY raced in the three path early, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, came
around the second turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. MELANIA T hopped up leaving the gate, saved
ground around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path, was caught in the lane and chased on to the
finish. TAPITARA raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the second turn in the four path and improved
position in the stretch while never threatening. MISS YOU NO MORE was taken up to rate the first time down the stretch, raced in the four path around the
first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the four path and was empty in the lane.
FREELOADINGSISTAH reared up leaving the gate and veered in, saved ground early, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside,
saved ground around the second bend and faded in the stretch.
