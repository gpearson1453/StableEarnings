FORGOTTEN PEACE never far back, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead
inside the furlong marker, then drew off and was kept to the task. ABITIBI broke sharply from the gate, leading early, moved up three and four wide through
the turn, came four wide into the stretch and closed well for the place. RUSTY MY BROTHER unsettled in the gate, stalked the pace on the outside, moved
up on the two path through the turn to gain a short lead, then edged past HALF BIRTHDAY and was outfinished for the place. HALF BIRTHDAY sprinted to
a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the turn, came again in the lane, edged ahead, then weakened late and was
outfinished for the show. WHEELINGNDEALING was never involved.

SUSIE'S SAVER unhurried, moved up three and four wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged ahead in the
final strides. JAZZ TIME GIRL tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside of that one, shaking clear into the stretch, drew off,
then was outfinished. RIA FORMOSA allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, angled widest, made
a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. BLUEBERRY PIE mid pack, moved to position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch,
made a steady gain, then drifted in late and flattened. PATH TO VICTORY well placed and outside, lost some position three wide through the turn, came
four wide into the stretch, closed well late and missed a share. ZORA hopped at the start, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into
the stretch and evened out. MISS CLAUDETTE mid pack, gained position inside through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out
for clear racing room and flattened the final furlong. FOLLOW THROUGH set the pace inside and faded the final furlong. HALEY'S HAPPY GIRL vied for
the early lead outside and faded through the turn.

Footnotes
TRUSTME IAMADOCTOR sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway unchallenged, drew off in the stretch and held while being kept to the task.
FAST LEARNER tracked the pace, moved to position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader, then was no threat to that one,
while clearly best of the rest. MAKE THE BED never far back, held position three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, evened
and held the show. ELM STREET mid pack, looped three wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch, evened and gained a share. OVERTIME
CHARLIE mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. NOT TODAY
GOVERNOR stalked the pace on the outside, lost some position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded the final furlong.
YANKEE TEA PARTY unhurried, looped four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. MR. IMPATIENT ran evenly.
GET READY SET FIRE improved position. BAD AS JOHN showed little. ELUSIVE CHANGE was never involved.
