Footnotes
MAZOKU stalked three wide, bid and gained an advantage at the quarter pole, drove clear in the final furlong and held sway. STAND BY YOU bumped with
an outer rival at the start, tracked behind the leaders and from the two path around the turn, shifted four wide nearing the lane and ran on to gain place in
the late stages. SHIP IT prompted two wide and between horses, failed to sustain pressure between the top pair nearing the lane, shifted outside of them
entering it, stayed on while getting outkicked by an outer rival in the final furlong and re-gained show. CRACKALACKING set the pace along the inside as a
pair of outer rivals applied pressure, got headed by his widest counterpart at the quarter pole, fought on into the final furlong but gave way late. HONEY
RUN missed the break, trailed along the inside, took rejoined the field turning for home two wide, then failed to factor. SUPERTALEOFHOUDINI bumped
with an inner rival upon leaving the gate, laid off of the pace along the inside and made little impact. GOSHEN tracked the leaders from the four path,
chased around the turn and faded. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most

Footnotes
MOON FLEET leaned in at the start, stalked closest to the clear leader and from the three path, ranged up nearing the lane, bid before gaining an
advantage at the furlong grounds and drove clear. BOLD APPEAL bobbled subtly while still breaking on top, sped clear early on, showed the way in the two
path, but was caught by an outer bidder with a furlong to go, then safely lasted for place. VINO VELOCE broke outwardly, raced at the rear in the four path,
drifted out in upper stretch and ran on to improve for show. LOW KEY FLEX chased the top pair along the inside and lacked a bid. NIGHT CRY broke a step
slow, laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path into the turn, then tired through the lane. RISK THE WIND lacked speed in the three path,
trailed around the turn and showed little.

inner counterpart persisted and prevailed. LOVEBUG vied for the lead with a pair of outer rivals into the turn, dueled with a single outer foe while slightly
headed turning for home, battled tenaciously through the lane but was bested. IBUKI chased along the inside, pursued from the two to three path around
the turn, bid for show along with an outer rival with five sixteenths to go, vied for that position with an inner rival through the final furlong and prevailed.
PREYATHOUSANDWORDS vied two wide and between horses, chased his counterparts leaving the three furlong pole, vied for show with an outer rival
through the lane but missed. WAVER tracked in the four path, bid for show turning for home but tired. STATLER INN broke a step slow while last away,
raced at the rear in the two path, shifted out to the six path into upper stretch and failed to factor. INDY'S UNIVERSE broke out and bumped the gate at the
start, faltered and trailed in the five to six path turning for home, and got outrun.

Footnotes
TAGLIATELLE stalked the embattled leading trio from the four path, issued a bold challenge outside of them at the quarter pole, drove clear entering the
lane and held sway while put to wraps late. EXPRESS CRUISER brushed an inner rival while last away from the starting gate, raced at the rear in the two to
three path, fanned five wide entering the lane and rallied to gain place in the final furlong. BOBWHITE BOBBY took light contact from an outer rival at the
start, tracked behind the leaders and from the two path, briefly awaited racing room nearing the lane, shifted four wide entering it, stayed on along with an
outer rival to bid for place leaving the furlong grounds but got outkicked. EDDIE M vied three deep around the turn, got outkicked by an outer bidder at the
quarter pole and gradually yielded. WESTERN COMMAND vied for the lead with a pair of outer rivals, proved no match for a wider bidder nearing the lane,
faded and was found to have bled. CITY OF CLOUDS vied two wide and between horses around the turn, but weakened.

Footnotes
LADY ORIENT broke a beat slow, tracked two wide, took the turn in the three path, encountered traffic behind the top pair entering upper stretch, chased
them before tipping inside of them in the final furlong, sustained a rail bid and edged an advantage in the shadow of the wire. DON'T CALL ME BABE
prompted three wide and between horses before stalking among foes around the turn, ranged up to bid in the four path and outside of the leader entering
the lane, dueled with that one into deep stretch, but got outfinished by an inner bidder late. BOIS BLANC vied two wide and between horses, led narrowly
around the turn, dug in to resist an outer challenge entering upper stretch, dueled gamely into the closing stages, but failed to regain even terms and lost
place to an inner bidder late. PRINCESS SKAYA laid off of the pace in the four to three path, then ran on willingly for a minor share. FIXIN TO BEE broke a
step slow while last away, saved ground well back, stayed on while shifting out in the final furlong but failed to menace. CITY COCKTAILS broke a beat
slow, tracked along the inside shifted two wide entering the lane, but lacked a bid and yielded. PRESHA broke outwardly, pressed in the four path into the
turn, but weakened in the five path entering the lane. MELITTLEFROSTGIRL vied along the inside, but faded in upper stretch. SWEET BEBSI lagged
behind and got outrun. BY REQUEST lacked speed two wide and never got involved.

Footnotes
AMERICAN RAIDER brushed with an outer rival at teh start, trailed along the inside early on, advanced past an outer pair approaching the half mile pole,
crept closer to the top pair from the two path around the far turn, bid outside of them entering the lane and drove past. QUEBRANCHO set the pace along
the inside, clung to an advantage from an outer presser around the far turn, disposed of that one as a wider challenger menaced entering upper stretch, but
was bested by that one in the final furlong. ENDLESS REIGN was brushed between horses at the start, tracked in the two path, got outmoved by an inner
rival with a half mite to go, chased from the rear around the far turn, yet ran on willingly to regain a minor share. CHULLIGAN brushed an inner rival at the
start, pressed outside of the pace setter, bid turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer rival and gave way in upper stretch. TIE BREAKER LENNIE
pursued from the four path and failed to factor.

Footnotes
PLAYBACK tracked two wide and between horses, loomed a danger outside of the top pair around the far turn, bid entering the lane, led into the final
furlong, drove clear and held sway from an outer pursuer. CHURNING BERNI stumbled outwardly at the start, lacked speed along the inside, launched a
rally advancing inside of troubled rivals entering the far turn, shifted out to the four path entering the lane, sustained his charge to gain place in teh final
sixteenth but was fended off thereafter. BABY AVERY pressed two wide, vied into the far turn, led as an outer rival menaced turning for home, got bested by
that bidder leaving the furlong grounds and yielded place late. PENNY ROYAL pursued from midpack in the two path, was roused to the four path around
the far turn, chased in the five path into the turn, yet stayed on to narrowly prevail for fourth. PRETTY PERTINENT stalked along the inside, chased two
wide around the far turn, lacked a bid and pursued mildly before losing fourth. SKYLAROSE was bumped by an inner rival soon after the start, laid off of the
pace two wide, then along the inside around the far turn and failed to threaten. BOLT'S BROAD bobbled subtly at the start, laid off of the pace three wide,
but was bothered by a rival, forced to steady and alter course into an outer foe into the far turn, chased from the four path and failed to factor. SUSTANCIA
set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer presser around the far turn, got headed turning for home and faded. AVALON GIRL broke awkwardly and
steadied while spotting the rest multiple lengths at the start, trailed early on and made little impact. SHEZALITTLESTINKER pursued from midpack in the
three to four path, but was bumped, bothered, and forced outwardly by inner rivals entering teh far turn, took that bend in the five path and faded.
POLITICAL SPIN lacked speed in the four to six path and made little impact. VIABLE stalked three deep, but went wrong entering the far turn, was pulled up
turning for home and got taken off of the track in an equine ambulance.

past the leader in the late stages. LA LA ROSE broke into an inner rival at the start, tracked along the inside, chased just behind the leading pair in upper
stretch, got outkicked by a wider bidder in the final sixteenth, yet split foes late to edge place approaching the wire. CABERNEIGH vied two wide, dueled in
the three path in upper stretch, led into the final furlong, but was bested between bidders in the final sixteenth. PLUM TRICKY vied for the lead with an outer
rival around the turn, sustained the duel through midstretch but yielded late. FLUENT stalked the embattled leading pair two wide, took aim outside of them
entering the lane, but lacked the needed punch. DETERMINED CANDY pursued from midpack three wide, chased five to six wide and among foes into the
final furlong, but failed to menace. SACOS STOGIE broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted four wide entering the lane, but yielded
