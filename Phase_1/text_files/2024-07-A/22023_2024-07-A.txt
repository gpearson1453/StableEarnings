TALLAPOOSA prompt the early leader from the outside three deep down the backstretch, took command into the upper stretch and finished well to edge
clear under strong handling. CAPTAIN'S FLAG chased the early pace setters ridden along, raced four wide around the far turn and finished well to be
second best. SECRET HONOR dropped back off the early going, raced five wide into the upper stretch, shifted in through the drive and moved up to
improve position. RED RIZZLER stalked the pace, was blocked briefly near the quarter pole from the inside, found room and flattened out. MALIBU BRAD
set a pressured early pace from the inside and weakened through the drive. REMEMBER THE FEAR trailed early on, swung wide into the lane and lacked a
bid.

Footnotes
JOLIE RULER stalked the pace three deep from the outside of foes, edged up to the leader through the far turn and finished strongly to build a long lead
under a hand ride. HEAVENLY HASH dropped back early on, made a four to three wide bid in the lane and rallied for the place position. LADY ATLANTIC
void of early speed, raced six wide into the upper stretch and made a good late gain to improve position. OPALINE tracked the early leader from the inside
and weakened through the drive. PLAY TWENTY was sent off to a clear early lead but was empty the final three sixteenths of a mile. MORNING LINE
NEWS stalked the early pace setters from the inside and tired.

upper stretch and had not enough for the top pair. LOTTA ROSES rated along early to race in hand, raced four to five wide through the stretch run and had
no final winning bid. NIFF settled off the early pace, raced from the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch and was even no closing run. BALI
BABY void of early speed, had an inside run and no late rally. SIGNATURE STREET was unhurried early on failed to respond. ZENCHUA SKY lost ground
to race far back and never menaced.

Footnotes
DIAMOND DAVE stumbled at the break, raced at the back of the pack after the poor start, raced from the inside around the far turn into the lane, angled out
near the three sixteenths pole and surged up under strong handling. FIRST MASAMUNE raced mid pack early on, raced just off the inside around the far
turn, swung seven wide into the lane and rallied well for the place position. WILDWOOD'S WARRIOR prompt the early leader two to three deep from the
outside and weakened a bit in the final stages. FLYING SAMURAI set all the pace and faltered inside the eighth pole. BLOOMING GARDEN settled off the
early going, had an inside run and no late response. POWERFUL MAN stalked the pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and tired. Pick 8 place

Footnotes
CODE NAME showed good early foot to set the early pace and held gamely to prevail under strong handling. PROFESSOR HIGGINS settled off the early
going, moved up through the far turn, split two deep near the sixteenth pole and finished gamely to the wire. MAN ON ATTACK was bumped at the start,
tracked the early leader two deep, dug in late three deep and kept on gamely to the wire. MONSTERONTHEMIDWAY settled off the early pace from the
inside, swung five wide into the lane and moved up to improve position. EVEN THE WIND stalked the pace near the rail and weakened. DANVILLE dropped
back early on, raced two to three wide and had no response. GLUCKSTADT was bumped at the start, raced six deep into the upper stretch and never
threatened. GIOVANNINO failed to sustain a bid.
