Footnotes
TIK TOK DADDY , in the three path between horses entering the stretch, lugged in near the eighth pole, rallied along the inner rail, switched leads twice in
the drive and was up in time. HOLONUI , three wide on the turn, chased the pace, floated wide in upper stretch and flattened out. CONTRIVANCE prompted
the early pace outside GREAT GOOGLYMOOGLY on the turn, gained a short lead in upper stretch and gave way in the drive. LADDIE DANCE , wide
around the turn, passed tired rivals. MIZTERGRANDCENTRAL worked between horses on the turn and through the stretch and failed to rally. GREAT
GOOGLYMOOGLY showed speed, saved ground on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and drifted out late when giving way. KINDA FONDA WANDA ,
pinched back leaving the starting gate, showed a late move. ROCKY'S ADVENTURE , very wide leaving the turn was not a factor. LEGEND'S THUNDER
saved ground on the turn, raced along the inner rail and gave way. GALACTIC GLORY bore out leaving the starting gate steadied entering the turn and
gave wy.

Footnotes
BARON'S LEGACY edged up nearing the half to take a stalking spot, bid two wide between foes leaving the far turn, dueled, emerged in a battle to the
inside of BOLD HONOR leaving the three sixteenths, got the better of that one leaving the furlong grounds, responded to solid left handed asks and drew
away. BOLD HONOR , four wide early, bid three wide between rivals near the three eighths, drifted out to about the five path sparring outside rivals soon
into the lane, held a slim advantage while on his left lead and outside the winner near the eighth pole, flattened out from there and just clung to the place.
HAZEDNCONFUSED , a bit fidgety just prior to the gates being sprung, broke slowly then regrouped to save ground and pull his way forward, remained
inside chasing the embattled leaders into the stretch, remained inside and churned on. ASCENDANCE , a bit sluggish leaving the gate, moved up five wide
outside rivals heading to the half mile marker, forced the issue four deep and and under a hustling ride mid turn, shifted in some past the three sixteenths
then needed more between foes in the final yards. DREAM RIVER sped clear soon after the start, set the pace towards the inner rail, was met by a trio of
rivals leaving the far turn, dueled into the lane while shifting out a path, stayed willingly past mid stretch then faded. DUBLSHOTOFCOURAGE stalked the
early pace two to three wide, failed to go on under pressure nearing the turn and faded. AKINGISALWAYSKING lost ground four wide mid turn, shifted
wider for the drive but lacked a response.

Footnotes
SUGA STEVE , five wide outside a rival prompting the early pace, dropped in a bit and engaged BUCKIN' DREAMER mid turn, sparred outside that one into
the lane, spurted clear under right handed asking leaving the three sixteenths, was given one ask with the left crop inside the furlong grounds then steadily
widened under hand encouragement. BUCKIN' DREAMER , nudged to the front, set the pace towards the inner rail, took pressure from outer rivals leaving
the far turn, fought on inside the winner from the five sixteenths to the three sixteenths then gave way grudgingly. ORDER OFTHE KETTLE broke slowly
then steadied soon after, lagged off the pace while saving ground, cut the corner into the lane, came out a bit and churned on. SILVERBULLETTWENTY
drifted in some after the start, corrected and raced off the pace while outside a rival, angled five wide for the drive but lacked a rally. DANCE FOR GREEN
tracked a contested pace while saving ground, was under pressure into the lane, eased out to chase between rivals nearing mid stretch then faded.
CASINO TRICKS , forced the early pace between foes, failed to go with the leaders past the five sixteenths and weakened.

Footnotes
BALLYHOO PRINCE stalked the pace in the two path down the backstretch and on the far turn, steadied lacking room near the quarter pole, moved to the
inner rail n upper stretch, bid for the lead in mid stretch and lasted. AWESOME STRIKE , between horses the far turn, steadied in traffic in upper stretch,
angled out in mid stretch, remained on his left lead and drifted out badly late. MIKE THE BOMB , bumped by HURRYING HOME at the start, disputed the
pace outside RETURN FIRE, repelled that one entering the stretch then dug in stubbornly between the top pair to just miss. DANCING MISCHIEF , outside
horses in the stretch, rallied mildly. HURRYING HOME bumped MIKE THE BOMB when coming out at the start, raced three wide the first turn, worked
between horses on the far turn and weakened. SINCERITO , three wide both turns, stalked the pace to the stretch then gave way. YAQUI VALLEY raced
inside horses and was no threat. LAST SECOND LOUIE , four wide both turns, was not a factor. RETURN FIRE hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to
the stretch then faltered.

SKIP THRU DA FIRE , quickly to the front, set the pace towards the inner rail while handling some outer pressure, responded to strong asking in upper
stretch, kicked away, switched over to her left lead in deep stretch and proved much the best while kept alert. STORMY IRISH LASS prompted the pace two
wide and between rivals heading to the turn, was under a strong ride trying to keep pace mid turn, was no match for the winner through the final three
sixteenths but kept on with effort to be well clear of the rest. SHIRLEY KNOT , bumped at the break, recovered and edged up nearing the half, dropped
inside to chase but went evenly in the drive. TIA MAYIN , roughed up at the break, dropped back to last, made a four wide run under a ride past the five
sixteenths, drifted in past mid stretch then came up empty. ANY FOOLS GOLD bore out at the break causing a jam up, corrected and edged up to prompt
three deep, failed to kick on under a ride leaving the quarter pole and faded. A P M NOTION , bumped and in tight at the break, raced off the pace, came
three wide for the drive but lacked a response. PAPERBACK EDITION saved ground pursuing the leaders, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths and
weakened. TWISTY RIVER flashed speed inside, dropped back into the turn then swung out for the stretch run while unable to make headway.

Footnotes
VISBY , unhurried outside horses down the backstretch, circled the turn four wide, rallied to take the lead late. SHINE ON MOON saved ground around the
turn chasing the pace, altered course to the three path in mid stretch when caught behind tiring rivals and rallied gamely inside the winner. LILLY SIMONE ,
steadied in traffic entering the turn, entered the stretch in the three path, got caught in traffic in mid stretch, altered course to the six path and closed gamely.
LADY SERENITY , taken to the rail after sprinting clear entering the turn, set the pace to inside the eighth pole and weakened late.
SWEETERTHANWHISKEY , up close between horses around the turn, remained between rivals, had aim on the lead in mid stretch and weakened.
WONDER GIRL , in close quarters at the start, steadied in traffic entering the turn, saved ground to the stretch and was not a factor. RYE SMILE prompted
the pace outside LADY SERENITY and gave way approaching the eighth pole.

Footnotes
DON'T GET CAUGHT , bumped at the break, sped clear early, was a bit green when appearing to want to get out into the turn, regrouped and dictated the
issue towards the inner rail and under some nudging past the five sixteenths, opened up while wandering out past mid stretch, switched over to his left lead
after being given a right handed ask and kept on eagerly to the wire. NORTHERN CARDINAL , bumped at the break, eased out and edged up to prompt the
pace, was under pressure pursuing into the stretch, was no match for the winner but continued with effort and held down the place. VALORE dropped off
the early pace, raced between runners nearing the five sixteenths, shifted out well in the track for the final furlong and continued on with interest. DICEY
GREY broke a step slow then drifted inward, recovered and circled four to five wide making some headway past the five sixteenths, drifted in through the
lane and came up empty. DIALED IN A PANIC saved ground off the pace, eased out and lacked a rally. NIPPY FITZ edged up three wide nearing the turn
and gained a stalking spot, chased wide into the stretch, shifted in and faded.
