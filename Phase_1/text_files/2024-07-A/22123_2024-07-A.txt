DUCHESS OF DESTIN tracked on the inside, bid between rivals entering the far turn, dueled with AUTUMN'S TURN, took over entering the stretch, drew
clear under urging and was in hand the final yards. AUTUMN'S TURN raced three wide on the first turn, then stalked between rivals, bid three wide entering
the far turn, could not go with the top pair, then rallied outside for second in the stretch. ROCKY SEAS set the pace racing with a clear lead, dueled inside
on the far turn and weakened in the final furlong. LILY THE KID broke in bumping a rival at the start, raced off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and
failed to threaten. ME SO LUCKY hit a fallen rider after the start and was steadied back, then was outrun early and did not factor. FIRST REIGN bobbled at
the break, stalked outside, chased and gave way on the far turn. SUMMER FLOWER stumbled badly at the start and lost the rider, walked off. After a
Stewards Inquiry into the start, the race was declared official. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to
arrive at the most accurate time.
