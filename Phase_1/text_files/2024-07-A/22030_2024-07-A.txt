Footnotes
LET HER RUN showed good early speed three wide, dueled three wide on the turn, battled it out with AIR MASQUE in the final furlong and prevailed. AIR
MASQUE dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, dueled with the winner past midstretch and dug in gamely inside of that rival to the finish. ONE
FINE WINE dueled two wide for command, dueled between rivals on the turn, could not stay with the top pair, shifted out at the sixteenth marker and held
for third. MOLLY'S A BULLET was bumped at the start, tracked on the inside, chased on the turn, steadied behind a rival at the sixteenth pole and gained
mildly. STARVIEW TWINKLE a bit reluctant to load, was bumped and steadied at the start, raced off the pace between rivals, came four wide into the lane
and gained mildly outside. SUNNYRIDGE JAIME raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane and failed to threaten. WHISKEY AND RAIN
chased two wide and tired. SALT AND LIGHT was off a bit slow, raced three wide off the pace and did not factor. VIVID ARTISTE was outrun.

MIA'S CRUSADE stalked the leader racing two wide, bid on the far turn, dueled to the quarter pole, took over and kicked clear at the top of the stretch, then
dug in gamely in the final sixteenth and narrowly held on. RIDING PRETTY raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up four wide on the far turn, rallied four
wide into the stretch, closed well outside, surged in deep stretch and just missed on the wire. BRAMBLE BAY tracked on the inside, saved ground on the far
turn, came two wide into the lane, rallied in the two path and closed late for third. MIDNIGHT HEIRESS raced three wide early, stalked two wide, chased
three wide on the far turn, made a bid and was outkicked. THE CLASSY ONE raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the turn, came wide and lacked
a rally. SEA MAIDEN set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn, dug in along the rail and weakened late. SUMMER'S COMIN was off slow and a bit
awkwardly, raced off the pace inside, steadied on the first turn, then did not factor. JOY AND PROSPERITY raced three wide early, settled two wide off the
pace and did not factor.

BUCKIN' LUCKY vied inside for the early lead, content to track the pacesetter, bid two wide entering the far turn, took over, then turned back a bid from the
runner up, drew clear, pulled away under urging and coasted late. SHE CAN SCAT stalked the pace racing off the inside, bid outside of the winner on the
turn, could not go with that rival, then dug in and held for second. GENERAL ROBINSON was bumped and steadied at the start, showed good early speed,
took over leaving the clubhouse turn, dueled briefly, then chased inside on the far turn and stayed on stubbornly through the stretch drive. NANASQUAN
was bumped at the start, raced off the pace, chased on the far turn and got fourth. LUMINOUS RULER raced two wide off the pace, came four wide into the
lane, gained mildly and missed for fourth. BORNFORGREATNESS was bumped at the start, raced three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace and did
