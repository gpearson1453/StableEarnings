Footnotes
RELIABLE LADY showed speed then raced just off the pace, chased in the three path on the turn, made a bid between foes outside the quarter-pole, took a
short lead in upper stretch, inched away under a right-handed crop into the final furlong, extended the advantage into the final sixteenth and prevailed while
kept to the task. LORD I WONDER broke in and was off slow, moved up then settled just off the pace, went two then three wide for most of the turn, shifted
four then five wide late on that bend, spun six wide into the stretch, was pulled in by the rider to elicit a lead change just inside the three-sixteenths, chased
the winner on the outside in the drive and flattened some while up for the place. MARTINGALE tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the four path
on the turn then chased the leader, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, battled outside of two foes under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the
final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. ASCENSION broke out a bit, settled on the outside under some urging, was roused for more while
three then four wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. CHANTEUSE went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two
path on the turn, was asked under threat outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage before the three-sixteenths pole while put to a right-handed crop,
swapped back to her inside lead under a right-handed crop shortly thereafter, switched back to the proper lead while dropping back at the furlong marker
and tired. CORONA PRINCESS was taken up between foes nearing the three-quarter pole then dropped back, passed the nine-sixteenths pole under
urging, moved from the two path to the rail on the turn, remained on her inside lead in upper stretch and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but
walked off.

Footnotes
DILLINGER broke on top and out at the start, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide into the turn, advanced outside
to issue a challenge nearing the quarter pole and swung six then five wide into upper stretch, seized command near the three-sixteenths and went clear
under a drive to prevail. GIANT'S FIRE coaxed from the gate, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch until tucked inside through the turn
coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place
honors. UNCLECHARLIESGIFT stumbled at the start, chased six paths off the inside until tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at
the seven-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position to garner the show honors, just missing for the runner up spot on
the wire. MUAZARAH dueled briefly from the two path with STORMQUIST to the outside before shaking off that foe a bit while establishing sole command
albeit still under pressing from that rival the rest of the way, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and was
caught with three-sixteenths to go, then weakened in the late stages. SOLO IN PARIS broke out at the start trading a bump with PASCHAL MOON, chased
two then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response. PASCHAL MOON bobbled
at the start and traded a bump with SOLO IN PARIS, who broke outwards, chased three wide until tucked inside five furlongs from home, got steadied in a
bit tight just inside the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. STORMQUIST dueled early
with MUAZARAH, and then prompted that foe from the outside, four paths off the rail down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the turn, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch in retreat and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
TWENTY SIX BLACK broke out at the start bumping CIGARETTE BOAT, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to get up in the final jumps over a trio in a blanket finish on the wire. TUNISIAN SPRING coaxed from
the gate, chased three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive between foes late
and missed on the wire. CIGARETTE BOAT got bumped at the start by TWENTY SIX BLACK, who broke outwards, chased two to three wide coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in under threat from a flanking trio and
was overwhelmed in the late stages and caught while just salvaging the show honors. YARROW chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the
quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to latch on the top trio inside the final sixteenth but was ultimately
bested by all three while not kicking on enough to impact those spots. INFLATION NATION (IRE) coaxed from the gate, showed the way along the inside
and then just off the inside, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was caught a furlong out, then weakened in the
late stages. SESAME SEED BAGEL stumbled at the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into
upper stretch, weakened. ALEAH ALEAH coaxed from the start, chased along the inside and then just off the inside coaxed along from the five-sixteenths,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DISCO DEANO stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the four path on the turn, took the lead into upper stretch, fought outside of the runner-up into
the final furlong then edged clear under strong urging. COLD AS HELL was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the
three path while between foes on the turn, gained a short lead coming to the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch, battled inside
that foe into the final furlong and was outfinished while able to get the place. FUNNY JOKE was well placed just off the pace, chased two then three wide on
the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and improved position to just get the show. SAFFA'S DAY was hustled from the gate, settled on the outside,
was roused in the five path on the turn and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. KANT BEAT THE ROCK settled under some urging, came
under stronger encouragement in the two path on the turn, moved out near the eighth-pole, raced on his inside lead in the final furlong and lacked the
needed response. JOKING WAY broke out at the start, was urged along near the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, swung six wide into the
stretch, remained on his inside lead until just before the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and failed to rally. GANGLY was bumped soundly
at the start, raced at the rear under urging, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path then moved further out, steadied off heels late
and failed to threaten. CHARGING AERO broke out and bumped soundly with a foe, was well placed just off the pace, chased inside to the two path on the
turn, spun three wide into the stretch and tired. CHATEAU was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the
turn, lost the advantage nearing the quarter-pole and gave way.

CLASSIC TIME broke in a step at the start and was corrected, chased four then three wide advancing on the front into the turn, remained patiently handled
until swinging four then three wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, took over command with three-sixteenths to go and drew clear under a drive,
then got geared down inside the final sixteenth to prevail as the rider pleased. CONCRETE CRUISER coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. KING'S LEAP coaxed from the gate, chased just off
the inside under prolonged coaxing from the half mile pole, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. CORVUS brushed the
near side stall at the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and showed late interest.
TAPWRITS TEMPER got bumped at the start by STORM THE STREETS, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung
five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. STRENGTHNGUIDANCE broke out at the start bumping REPLEVIN and was steadied,
chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. STORM THE STREETS broke in at
the start bumping TAPWRITS TEMPER, dueled three then two wide with RETEKO to his inside, got let out taking the two path into upper stretch and was
collared with three-sixteenths to run, then weakened to the finish. PACIFIC HIGHWAY chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch, made no impact. REPLEVIN got bumped at the start by STRENGTHNGUIDANCE, chased five paths off the inside down

far turn, swung seven wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to up in the final sixteenth and prevail. GILDED CRAKEN
broke out and hit the gate then brushed with a foe, settled on the inside, was urged along late on the backstretch, shifted three wide into the stretch, chased
past the three-sixteenths pole, made a bid near the furlong marker, battled with the winner to the finish and missed while able to get the place. PALACE
VIEW (IRE) rounded the first turn in the two path, settled in the back half of the field, moved from the rail to the two path on the far turn, was roused near the
quarter-pole, rallied to make a bid near the eighth-pole, battled with multiple opponents in the final furlong and was oufinished while just able to get the
show. ADDICTED TO YOU traveled around the opening bend in the two path, settled in third position, moved closer near the seven-sixteenths pole, stalked
three wide on the far turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole, made a four wide bid into the stretch, led from the three-sixteenths pole into the final furlong
then was also outfinished then just missed the show. FRONT MAN broke in and bumped with a foe, moved in early then settled in the two path, was roused
four wide into the stretch, came between foes around the three-sixteenths pole, chased the vanguard in the drive and was out-kicked. OUR COUNTRY
bumped with a rival at the start, moved in nearing the first turn then had the rider fall back in the saddle, saved ground at the rear of the field, was roused in
the vicinity of the quarter-pole, steadied behind the fading pacesetter then moved around that foe around the three-sixteenths pole and improved position.
LEFTEMBEHIND went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, traveled two then three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch then
angled out and lacked the needed kick. JUST FOR LUCK brushed the outside of the gate at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, was roused four wide on the far turn then came five wide into the stretch, gained into a good striking position before the furlong marker but tired.

reached a reasonable striking position before the furlong marker but lacked the needed response. DEVIL'S CAY was forced out then bumped lightly with a
foe at the break, saved ground while settling off the pace, was roused on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and also lacked the needed
response. MAURITIUS raced in the three path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid late on the backstretch, vied in the two path on

Footnotes
MISS JUSTIFY chased along the inside and then just off the inside into the far turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into
upper stretch, rallied up the rail to issue a challenge through the final furlong, seized command seventy yards from the finish and prevailed safe on the wire.
STRIKER HAS DIAL coaxed from the gate, led briefly early on before DAZZLING MOVE did so and swept to the front seven furlongs from home, chased
that rival three then two wide advancing into the far turn, assumed command nearing the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive drifting slightly out until corrected and angled in just inside the eighth pole to look the aforementioned foe in the eye, got collared with seventy yards to
the finish and dug in loosely between foes late to preserve the place honors. COURBE stumbled at the start, raced just off the inside through the opening
dog legged turn, then chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, shied in under a right
handed crop a furlong out and offered up a mild kick. LADY MOSCATO bobbled at the break, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, weakened. BELLS BEACH broke out at the start, chased four wide through the first turn and then four to
five wide thereafter, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. WINDY WALK lost her rear
footing at the start, raced three wide through the first turn before chasing six then five wide down the backstretch, tucked four then three wide through the far
turn and continued three wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. DAZZLING MOVE broke out at the start and was corrected and then
came with a rush five then four wide through the first turn to take command seven furlongs from home, spurted away tucked to the two path down the
backstretch, then tucked inside into the far turn coming under growing threat to the outside, yielded the front readily inside the three-eighths marker and
faded, went just off the inside into upper stretch and was eased home through to the finish.

TWIRLING QUEEN tracked the leader under a snug hold, stalked outside while three then four wide on the turn, ranged up to make a bid coming to the
quarter-pole, took the advantage in upper stretch, battled outside of TOUPIE into the final furlong, disposed of that foe into the final sixteenth and prevailed
under strong urging. KAIRYU (IRE) settled on the inside of a rival, went three wide on the turn, was roused near the quarter-pole, brushed with a foe while
moving out in upper stretch and finished with good courage for the place. CLOUDWALKER settled on the outside, went around the turn in the four path, was
brushed by the runner-up while trying to keep that foe behind horses in upper stretch, chased outside into the final sixteenth and willingly earned the show.
TOUPIE showed early speed, contested the pace on the inside of a foe under a tight hold, was wrestled back off the pace near the seven-sixteenths pole,
shifted from the rail to the three path early on the turn, came under encouragement on that bend, made a bid between horses at the quarter-pole, battled
inside of the winner into the final furlong and was outfinished then just lost the show. DANCING DUCHESS dropped back then settled at the rear, went two
to three wide under urging on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths pole under extra left-rein pressure, angled out outside the furlong marker and gained but
missed the superfecta. IN OUR TIME was taken in hand then rated just off the pace, saved ground while let out on the turn, was given her cue near the
five-sixteenths pole, found room along the rail into upper stretch, steadied then that hole closed near the furlong marker then altered out and lacked the
needed kick. EVER SO SWEET (IRE) stumbled at the start but broke with the field, disputed the pace on the outside, moved clear coming to the
seven-sixteenths pole, went around the turn in the two path, was asked near the quarter-pole then headed in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
OVER AND OLLIE got bumped at the start by REMEMBER THE CHIEF and in turn bumped COMANCHE PEAK, tracked the pace along the inside coaxed
along intermittently at times, advanced half a mile from home on the leaders, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch as REMEMBER THE
CHIEF drifted to the two path, then edged away under a drive to prevail. FIRE BARON chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in willingly to secure the place honors. PUJOL three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. SMOOTH AN EASY three wide in pursuit,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out nine wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. GUILE chased two to three wide coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out seven to eight wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. DANGEROUS DRIVER chased two to
three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. COMANCHE PEAK (GB) got
bumped at the start by OVER AND OLLIE due to pressure from REMEMBER THE CHIEF and got pushed behind foes, chased along the inside coming
under coaxing three furlongs out, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. TORPEDO RUN established the front shortly after the
start and showed the way briefly before being engaged in head to head combat by REMEMBER THE CHIEF to the outside into the first turn, widened away
as a pair and dueled into the backstretch opening up lengths on the rest of the field, eased off that rival midway down the backstretch, advanced once more
into the far turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, paused very briefly at the three-sixteenths as
REMEMBER THE CHIEF drifted briefly and then tired through to the finish. BEACH BLANKET three wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide
down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide for home and tired.
REMEMBER THE CHIEF broke in at the start bumping OVER AND OLLIE into COMANCHE PEAK, raced forwardly placed three then two wide through the
first turn hooking up head to head with TORPEDO RUN to his inside, widened away as a pair down the backstretch and had his main pace rival ease off
before coming again through the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and drifted out slightly giving
up the rail to the eventual winner and forcing TORPDEO RUN to pause with three-sixteenths to go, then got eased along through to the end. BOOKWORM
chased along the inside coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, tired.
