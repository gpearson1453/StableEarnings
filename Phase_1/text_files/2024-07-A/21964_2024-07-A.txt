Footnotes
ITALIAN SOIREE veered in at the start bumping and forcing HOME WRECKER to check and in turn bump AS CATCH CAN, chased five then four wide
coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, seized command three-sixteenths from home and drew clear under a
drive to prevail. YELLOW broke inwards brushing the near side stall at the start and then filled the space left vacant by ITALIAN SOIREE veering inwards
before being corrected, showed the way in hand three then two wide under some pressure from LUCKFORYOU to the outside before being joined by the
top one near the three-eighths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, got collared with three-sixteenths to go
and kept on under a drive clear of the rest and along second best. HOME WRECKER got bumped and forced to check at the start when ITALIAN SOIREE
veered inwards and conceded four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased two to three wide briefly before tucking inside through the
turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors while never threatening
the top pair. AS CATCH CAN got bumped at the start by HOME WRECKER due to pressure from ITALIAN SOIREE and conceded three lengths to the front
before settling into stride, chased three to four wide briefly before tucking inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out
five wide into upper stretch and tired. LUCKFORYOU showed brief speed four then three wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun two to
three wide into upper stretch, tired. There was an Objection by the trainer of HOME WRECKER alleging interference against ITALIAN SOIREE at the start.

Footnotes
ICHIBAN went to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside while challenged on the
far turn, responded well when asked coming to the quarter-pole, shook off a foe into upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop at the eighth-pole,
drifted out a bit in the final furlong, remained clear into the final sixteenth and just held under strong urging. SEDONA bobbled outward at the start but broke
with the field, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, chased three wide on the far turn, was driven
four wide into the stretch then drifted out under a left-handed crop, was switched to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, gained on the winner
into the final sixteenth and just missed while clear for the place. SWEET MYSTERY bumped with a rival at the start then was urged along early, went four
then three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the two path early on the far turn then made a bid with three furlongs to run, lost
touch with the winner into upper stretch and was outfinished while clear for the show. MIZ SENSE bumped with an opponent at the start, tossed her head
when taken under a snug hold nearing the first turn, was eager under restraint in the three then two path on that bend, stalked outside on the backstretch,
dropped back under urging with a half-mile to run, went two then three wide on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and tired. TONED UP settled on
the inside, was ridden along late on the backstretch, moved off the rail outside the quarter-pole, turned into the stretch in the three path and lacked the
needed response. WHISTLER'S STYLE moved in into the first turn, saved ground on that bend, settled at the rear, was urged late on the backstretch,
rounded the far turn in the two path and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MOUFFY lunged, breaking awkwardly and in turn bumped MOONAGE DAYDREAM into DAMASO, settled just off the inside at the tail of the field through
the opening half mile, came under light coaxing and continued just off the inside through the far turn and came under urging with five-sixteenths to go,
swung five to six wide into upper stretch, got bumped in behind by MIDNIGHT MILE near the eighth pole as that foe attempted to gain some clearance, dug
in taking command sixteenth out under challenge from MIDNIGHT MILE to the inside and gamely rebuffed that foe to the finish. MIDNIGHT MILE (IRE)
tracked the pace along the inside patiently handled, swung five wide into upper stretch loosely in behind LADY BETH, tipped out slightly and bumped
MOUFFY in the hind end to gain the needed clearance when roused a furlong out, rallied to issue a challenge inside that station but was fended off when
not having enough to get on even terms with the winner and was along for the place honors. LADY BETH broke in at the start bumping DAMASO into
MOONAGE DAYDREAM and against pressure inside from MOUFFY, tracked the pace two then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung five then four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive taking command just outside the eighth pole, got collared a sixteenth from home and kept
on clear for the show honors. MOONAGE DAYDREAM got bumped between foes at the start and came under coaxing to establish the front, showed the
way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three then two wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared
just outside the eighth pole, weakened through to the finish. DAMASO got bumped between foes at the break, tracked the leader in closest aim just off the
inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths issuing a challenge for command, cornered four then three wide into upper stretch, dug in between foes to
the eighth pole, weakened to the wire.

HEADLINE NUMBERS climbed into kickback leaving the chute, settled on the outside, gained fast in the five path on the turn, dropped to the four path while
taking the lead late on that bend, moved further in while going clear into upper stretch, was put to a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker and drew
away under steady urging. PATTY BROWN EYES tracked the pace on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, chased in the four path on the
turn, came five wide into the stretch, pursued the winner into the final furlong and proved no match while just able to get the place. TIRUPATI contested the
pace on the far outside, was asked in the three path on the turn, lost touch with the winner under a drive in upper stretch and just missed the place while
clear for the show. GREATEST GIFT was urged along off the pace, moved up with six furlongs to run, dropped back along the rail early on the turn, shifted
to the three path late on that bend and had nothing left. BEWILDERED contested the pace towards the inside, was asked along the rail on the turn, dropped
back while remaining on her inside lead in upper stretch and tired. SILVOLOGY lost her footing at the start and was off a step slow, moved up near the
three-quarter pole, was urged along in the two path on the turn then driven three wide into the stretch and came up empty. NO TRICKS broke very slow
then ducked in sharply, spotted the field about twenty lengths by the time she began to move forward, tacked onto the rear of the field while inside to the two
path on the turn and was no factor.

drive to prevail. JUST MUSIC chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into
upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while along clear of the rest and second best. GRACEFUL ROSE coaxed from the gate, vied four then three
wide before easing off briefly near the nine-sixteenths, advanced once more three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung
four wide into upper stretch, weakened while along for the show honors. COVER THE SPREAD chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the

OUTLAW KID dropped back then settled towards the rear, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch then rallied on
the outside, closed fast to make a bid inside the furlong marker, took the advantage just inside the sixteenth-pole, battled with the runner-up to the finish and
narrowly prevailed under strong urging. BIG INVASION angled in early, was well spotted just off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, was roused
four wide into the stretch, gained to make a bid inside the three-sixteenths pole, took the advantage inside the furlong marker, led into the final sixteenth
then was headed by the winner, fought on with that foe to the finish and just missed while able to get the place. SON OF A BIRCH settled off the pace,
dropped back late on the backstretch, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, pursued the runner-up in the
drive and finished with good courage to garner the show. BOURBON MUSIC settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the
stretch and improved position for the last spot in the superfecta. BOAT'S A ROCKIN broke alertly and went straight to the front, moved in while showing the
way, vied in the two path on the turn, came under the crop under threat in upper stretch, lost the advantage inside the furlong marker and weakened. THIN
WHITE DUKE was urged along at the rear, moved from three to five wide on the turn, came nine wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. HIGH FRONT
was taken in hand early, stalked the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the three path while let out on the turn, battled under a drive in upper stretch,
dropped back into the final furlong and tired. CLOUDY was ridden along towards the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, came eight wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed response. HEAVEN STREET was well placed just off the pace, dropped back along the rail on the turn and came up empty.
YES AND YES hit the outside of the gate at the start, moved up on the outside to track the pace, was urged four wide on the turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
CATCH A WAVE raced four then three wide through the first turn before heading past the stands the initial time three paths off the rail, continued three wide
through the second turn and then chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch coming under light coaxing half a mile from home, tucked to
the two path into the far and final turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to engage the leader
a furlong out, dug in dueling to the finish in gams fashion and bested his main rival in the final jumps to the wire. BREES coaxed from the gate, raced five
wide into the first turn and then tucked four then three wide when forwardly placed, attended the leader to the outside in the two path at times dueling in
hand with that foe through sensible splits, advanced to take over command just outside the three-eighths pole and slipped away coming under coaxing near
the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under lone threat to the outside and stubbornly held command dueling through to the end in game
fashion but was ultimately collared in the final strides to the finish. BE LIKE CLINT bobbled at the start, raced along the inside through the first turn and
stretch the first time before tipping to the two path through the second turn, chased three wide thereafter coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths,
swung three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. HOLD THE SALSA tracked the pace just off the inside briefly and then along the inside
coming under light coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out and got set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. GOING
CONCERN (GB) coaxed from the gate, raced along the inside early on and then just off the inside, came under coaxing three furlongs from home,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. SCAT TU TAP coaxed from the gate, raced just off the inside early on before tipping two to
three wide through the second turn, went four wide down the backstretch, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued four wide into upper stretch
and weakened. INDIANQUEST bobbled at the break and came under coaxing to show the way in hand along the inside under accompaniment from BREES
to the outside but facing little pressure save that rival/s presence, came under increased pressure nearing the final turn and yielded the front just outside the
three-eighths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. Please note due to a timing error the first quarter
split was hand timed.

Footnotes
EMERY broke out a tad then was coaxed from the start, established a good position while settling into stride, stalked the leading duo in the four path on the
turn, was given her cue outside the quarter-pole, chased under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop inside the furlong
marker, had the rider put away the crop while gaining into the final sixteenth and got up under a strong hand-ride to prevail. MYSTIC LAKE went to the front,
set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths pole, shook clear in upper stretch, came under
a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, led into the final sixteenth, was switched to a left-handed crop and given one pop late then was caught while
well clear for second. HALINA'S FORTE broke out at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, was asked near the
five-sixteenths pole, lost touch with the runner-up in upper stretch and tired. AUTUMN EVENING was off a step slow while carried out, raced on the outside
at the rear under urging, dropped from the three path to the two path early on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
BOSSY JEANS established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled until let out taking the inside route into upper stretch,
came off the rail straightened away to the two path and edged clear under a drive to prevail. LUCKY AND GORGEOUS broke out at the start bumping
DUBAWI WOWIE in tandem with DEVILS ARROW, who broke inwards, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. DUBAWI WOWIE got bumped between foes who each broke her way at the start, then got
forced soon after the break to steady off the heels of rivals when losing her lane, chased two then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. SENDERA tracked the leader in closest aim just off the inside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. TONGUE TWISTER three wide through the first turn,
chased three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late going. MALIBU'S DYNAMITE
settled just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no
response. SAVING MEMORIES four wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide
into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. THE SPLENDID ONE coaxed from the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened. TROUBLED LUCK saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, took the inside route into upper stretch, was
never fully engaged by the rider and weakened to the finish. DEVILS ARROW broke in at the start bumping DUBAWI WOWIE in concert with LUCKY AND
GORGEOUS, who broke outwards, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and made
