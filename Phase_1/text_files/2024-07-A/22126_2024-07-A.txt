Footnotes
DANCIN ROCKET tracked the leader in opening stages, edged closer two wide around the turn, swung into action three wide entering the lane, quickly took
over the lead and pulled away. BUREAUCRATIC lacked speed and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn, shifted three to four wide for the drive,
sustained a steady bid and gained place. MISCHIEVOUS MAX was forwardly placed along the inside, cut the corner entering the head of the lane, was
ridden along the inside in close contention then flattened and lost place. SUBSEQUENT EVENT sped to the lead at the start, continued on top around the
turn, got collared two wide at the head of the lane and emptied out.

Footnotes
JERI DAWN was allowed to settle out of the gate and continued well off the early pace, edged closer late on the far turn, took over the lead three wide at the
head of the lane, widened advantage and kept to task. CHROME RACER vied for the lead between rivals around the first turn, continued to battle outside of
INDY AGAIN around the far turn, got overtaken by the winner at the head of the lane and ran on for second best. INDY AGAIN dueled for the lead around
the first turn, continued to battle inside of CHROME RACER around the far turn, was no match when JERI DAWN swept by at the head of the lane, ran
along for show and finished well clear over the rest. NORTHERN GEM raced well off the early pace, hustled along four wide into the upper stretch and failed
to move on. I THINK I KNOW YOU was well placed tracking the embattled trio in early stages, had no response when called upon around the final turn and
retreated. SHE'S A BIG STAR vied three wide for the early lead then came up empty after the half.

Footnotes
PAPA GEEB sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace and held a slim margin around the turn, given cue along the rail turning for home, responded
willingly, widened to a commanding advantage, tapped once in the final furlong then drew off while ridden out. OXFORD OUTING chased the top two
leaders in the early going, was ridden along three wide around the turn, came four paths wide into upper stretch, sustained bid and captured place. GLOME
was away awkwardly at the start and dropped back, trailed the field, responded at the head of the lane, rallied, split foes late and just missed place. BILLY
WHO was not too far back and ridden along two wide around the turn, ran on into the lane then evened late and lost runner up spots. GUNPOWDER N'
LEAD was not too far back, hustled up along the rail around the turn, ran on into the lane then ran on evenly in the final sixteenth. BAD BOY BRAWNY
raced off the early pace, came three wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. SPIRITED DREAM was forwardly placed chasing the early leader,
remained in close contention around the turn then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
SINGING EMMA vied outside of STAY FABULOUS up the backstretch, battled on while holding a slight edge late on the turn, shook clear in upper stretch
and held sway. PLEASINGLY rated three wide near midpack, edged a bit closer late on the turn, hustled along four paths wide into upper stretch, steadily
edged up closer in the final furlong and outdueled rival to take place. WREAKING HAVOC tracked the top pair up the backstretch, loomed a threat three
wide at the quarter pole, weakened off the leader entering upper stretch, but ran in contention and got edged late for place. FLOATING was not too far back
early on, saved ground around the turn, angled three wide turning for home, came in a path and ran on evenly late. STAY FABULOUS vied inside of
SINGING EMMA up the backstretch, battled on around the turn, could not match strides past upper stretch but ran on then came up empty in the final
furlong. SWEET MOTHER MARY lacked speed and raced in the back, hustled along four to five wide into the lane and lacked the needed response for
impact. JADE EMPIRE came up empty after a half and dropped back.

DREADPIRATEROBERTS tracked the top trio in a spread out field up the backstretch, edged closer racing two wide late on the far turn, responded when
called upon entering the upper stretch and swept by tiring TOSKAS RULER in the final sixteenth. TOSKA'S RULER sped to the lead at the start and set the
uncontested pace, continued clear still unleashed around the far turn, saved ground entering the lane, hustled along, remained clear mid-stretch then got
overtaken late. SHIPS ON FIRE sat off the top pair in a strung out field up the backstretch, edged closer late on the far turn, came three to four wide into
upper stretch, sustained bid and just missed place. WARRIOR'S RUN raced in the back, hustled along two wide into the lane and gained position without
threatening. MAHOMES was the closest pursuer of the early leader, sustained inside bid around the far turn then weakened in the lane. BIG PINES SANDY
raced off the early pace, came three wide into the lane and failed to threaten. RUNNING ALEX'SBAND was unhurried and saved ground to no avail.
WHISKEY WEDNESDAY raced off the pace and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
I LOVE ROCKNSTROLL tracked the early pace along the inside, lacked racing room along the rail late on the far turn, cut the corner and got clear entering
upper stretch, edged ahead at the furlong marker and kept clear. PLEASEUSETHEPORTAL pressed the pace up the backstretch, vied for the lead around
the turn, continued in striking range at the furlong marker, then failed to move on with the winner and cleared second best. ROWDY RAY tracked the pace
up the backstretch, raced in close contention three wide late on the far turn, came four paths wide into the upper stretch, ran on and re-gained a share. A
BRUSH OF LUCK set a pressured pace along the inside through early stages, vied for the lead around the far turn, continued in close contention a furlong
out then gave way. DAY MONEY was not far off the pace in early stages, saved ground and hustled up along the inside into upper stretch and failed to kick
on. LEADING THE CAUSE settled through early stages, was ridden along two wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. WELLER ROGUE raced in the
back, came four wide into the lane and steadily faded.

for the lead going by the quarter pole, battled on to the furlong marker, failed to kick on with the winner at the sixteenth pole but stayed on gamely and
nipped foe to take place. SHANIAH settled off the front runners in the early going, edged closer two wide late on the turn, raced behind a wall of pursuers in
upper stretch, found a path three wide at the eighth pole, moved up into striking distance then lacked the closing kick to prevail. JACKIE FLASH rated off the
early leaders, raced two wide around the turn, shifted out to the five paths for clear racing room at the head of the lane closed with a rush. DA CANDY
CANE set a pressured pace, vied for the lead around the turn, fought back to the furlong marker then flattened out. IRON LOTUS was forwardly placed
three wide, hustled along into the stretch, raced in striking distance five paths wide at the furlong marker then evened out. DOUGHTY raced near midpack
