BLUEGRASS GO GO saved ground setting the pace and gradually increased his advantage. R BARRACUDA chased BLUEGRASS GO GO while racing
two-wide, was unable to reach that one but continued on well for the place. ELDER MACK was off a step slow then moved up along the inside on the turn,
slipped through during the drive and finished well for third in a steady effort. SIR ARGENTO was reserved off the early pace, came three-wide into the
stretch and went evenly. DEKUDYLAN dropped back while saving ground and gradually improved his position. GRAZED BY LOVE was allowed to settle
while racing four-wide on the turn but lacked a rally. DRIVE TRAIN was unhurried while racing three-wide on the turn and failed to seriously threaten.
WHISKEYONTHEROCKS settled in the middle of the field while racing three-wide and gave way after three furlongs.

Footnotes
SPROSTON was unhurried early, rallied along the inside into the stretch and closed strongly to be up in the final strides. SURPRISE FASHION was
reserved off the early pace, angled out to be four-wide nearing the quarter pole, took the lead from SENSEMAKER nearing the sixteenth pole and then just
failed to last. SENSEMAKER prompted ANNA'S IRON MAN racing along the inside, took the lead from that one nearing the quarter pole then drifted out
slightly nearing the eighth pole and held on fairly well for third when headed. MARKSMAN ON TARGET dropped back early while saving ground, swung out
to be six-wide entering the stretch and tallied late. ANNA'S IRON MAN set the pressured pace to near the quarter pole while two-wide and weakened. ITS
BIG was close-up early while racing two-wide and tired. DYF was forwardly place while racing three-wide but lacked a rally. SOCAL RED settled in the
middle of the field early while racing four-wide and failed to menace.

Footnotes
HEY BARMAID was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, moved up to take the lead nearing the quarter pole, opened clear nearing the eighth pole and
maintained a safe advantage. SQUARE FUN prompted the early pace from along the inside, dropped back slightly on the turn, angled out to come
three-wide into the stretch and finished well for second in a steady effort. CANDIED JOULE was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and
finished in a mild rally. ASK ALICE was reserved off the early pace, angled out to come four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. HOT LAVA CAKE set
the pressured paced while racing slightly removed from the rail, ducked about when headed nearing the eighth pole and finished willingly when
straightened. BIKINI NATION was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. SETTLER'S COVE raced in the middle of the pack
for three furlongs while racing three-wide and gave way.
