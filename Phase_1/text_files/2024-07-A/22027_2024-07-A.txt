Footnotes
EMPIRE'S BEST broke slightly inwards and bumped foe, then moved along the rail to establish the pace down the backstretch, remained clear throughout
the far turn and was kept to task down the lane unbothered. HARD TO COME BY saved ground in the early stages while racing from the two path mid pack,
came under vigorous urging heading into the far turn to gain second position, rallied bid in the upper stretch but could not catch the leader. CROW'S NEST
was allowed to settle towards the back while two wide down the backstretch, then rallied bid while three to four wide on the far turn and needed more in the
stretch and held the show position. BENZODINI raced along the rail mid pack and failed to rally. TOP COP broke outwardly and bumped foe and failed to
menace. SONNY BOB was bumped from both sides at the start and was no factor. NORTHWIND was away well to track the leader from the two path in the
early furlongs, then faded on the far turn and did not rally in the stretch.

Footnotes
MR. TEXAS CHARM was coxed early to gain command at the nine sixteenths, then drew clear on the turn and held sway down the stretch to prevail.
MANIFESTED pressed the pace while two wide early, was in a steady drive on the turn while pursuing the clearing leader, rallied bid in the upper stretch,
was no match and held the place position. SILVER STEF HIT was allowed to settle two wide, then rallied bid leaving the bend, got up to third position and
needed more to catch the cleared leader. COMES THE SUN was allowed to settle while three wide, then rallied bid leaving the turn and kept on while in a
mild drive just missing the show position. SUPER EKATI was off slowly then trailed early and never threatened. RICH MOUNTAIN was away alertly and led
briefly, then chased the emerging leader into the turn while three wide and lacked rallying in the stretch. SIPPIN SCOTCH was no menace. JAMIAN failed to
rally.

Footnotes
ILLUSTRATOR was unhurried early, saved ground down the backstretch, was steadily gaining ground while four wide on the far turn, dug in gamely while
contesting with inner rivals in the stretch and was up at the wire to prevail. MIND BOLT moved from the inside to set the pace down the early backstretch,
was confronted by an outer foe to go duel heading into the turn, was contested by a third counterpart at the quarter pole, vied briefly before assuming
command in the early stretch, was in an all out drive then was out finished by ILLUSTRATOR and was second best. KENTUCKY DAWN tracked the pace
from the two path down the backstretch, inched up while three wide on the turn to challenge for the lead, vied in the upper stretch, could not overtake the
leader and was out finished in the final yards and was best for third place. LOUIS THE CHAMP was allowed to settle along the rail towards the rear, then
rallied bid on the far turn and kept on down the lane to no avail in the end. FIREBALL BIRDIE tracked the pace from the inside down the backstretch, was
urging on the far turn to rally a bid in the late stretch and lacked the needed response. DEVIL'S MISCHIEF broke outwardly, then settled at the back of the
field, bid while three wide on the far turn and never threatened. THIRD STREET led the way briefly into the first turn, then pressed the emerging leader
before moving up at the half to go shoulder to shoulder into the far turn, lacked the overcoming bid and gave way in the late stretch. RUSTY failed to rally.

CHANGING TIMES was away well to set the pace, was pressured by an outer foe on the far turn, was unfazed and pulled away down the stretch to prove.
FROM THE HEART drifted inwards and bumped foe, then trailed at the tail of the field with an inner rival, shifted five wide leaving the far turn, to bid past
inner foes and close well for the place winnings. JEWELSTOWN drifted out and bumped foe, then stalked the pace while two wide throughout, rallied bid on
the far turn, could not overpower the pace setter and gave way. JIM NED was bumped on both sides at the start, was allowed to settle while three wide,
then rallied leaving the far turn while coming out four wide and kept on down the lane but it was not enough in the end. GEORGIA DEPUTY was unhurried
early, settle in the four path down the backstretch, then rallied a mild bid in the late stretch and never threatened. BAREFOOT SAMURAI was allowed to
settle along the rail mid pack and raced at a moderate pace and needed rally in the stretch. BAY BE GONE was no threat. SUMMER LOVER tracked from
the inside, was urging steadily on the far turn and failed to rally in the stretch and gave way. EMBOITE (IRE) tracked the pace from the two path, rallied bid
on the far turn and did not fire but flattened out instead. GOLD BARON was outrun and no factor.

Footnotes
TENSAS LU LU established the early pace from the inside, then led confidently while in steady hand ride to prove clearly the best. ANTIFREEZE laid off the
pace while two wide towards the back, came under coaxing leaving the bend to bid between rivals, gain second position and was in a mild drive in pursuit of
the leader and maintained the place winnings. POETIC UNION was allowed to settle towards the back and saved ground, then fanned out five wide leaving
the bend and closed well down the lane to be up for the show prize besting the rest of the field. BIDOFHONEY was impeded at the start, then stalked from
the inside while in a steady hand ride, then rallied a mild bid in the late stretch and needed more. AUSTIN CITY GIRL prompted the pace while two wide,
was in a hard drive in attempt to overpower the leader, was unsuccessful and flattened out. MISSWISH was brushed at the start and was no threat. ATTA
MOY GIRL stalked the pace from the two path, then rallied bid coming off the turn while four wide and did not spark in the stretch. CREAM PUFF REAPER
broke outwardly and brushed foe and was no menace. LIBBIES BABY veered outwardly impeding rival and was no rally.

Footnotes
PAINTBRUSH saved ground in the early furlongs while racing mid pack, then rallied a bid on the far turn while passing rivals, vied with two inner foes in the
early stretch then kicked clear to prevail while in a strong drive. SAN MATEO KAT remained well rated while tracking the pace from the two path in the early
furlongs, was roused on the far turn to battle between rivals in the upper stretch then was out kicked by PAINTBRUSH and was second best. TAHITIAN
BREEZE raced mid pack from the inside, then rallied bid coming off the far turn, angled out four wide and closed well for the show prize. ARMY KITTEN
was unhurried early while racing in the back trio, then swung four to five wide leaving the far turn and closed belatedly but it was too late. MADE AN OFFER
was bumped at the start, tracked from the inside throughout the early furlongs, then rallied bid in the upper stretch and lacked the needed response.
SKYVIEW DRIVE set the pace from the inside, was met with an outer foe mid backstretch to spar heading into the far turn, cleared said foe then battled
grudgingly with two outer counterparts in the early stretch before giving way. LADY WITH A CAUSE was no menace. CAFEZINHO moved up from the three
path into the first turn to press the pace down the early backstretch, then bid to duel with the pace setter heading into the far turn, was used up and
overpowered by incoming rivals and gave way in the stretch. SHELL SHOCK was forwardly placed while two wide into the first turn to stalk the pace down
the backstretch while in a mild drive, then flattened out after the far turn. KENTUCKY ANGEL broke outwardly and bumped foe, was shuffled back and no
factor.
