Footnotes
DI'S SURPRISE set the pace on a well measured lead to the quarter pole, responded when caled upon turning for home to quickly open a clear advantage
and held the closer safe. DOROTHY CROWFOOT in tight at the start, reserved off the pace through the turn, rallied inside saving ground turning for home
and closed well late to be gaining in deep stretch. CLOEY ATTACK prompted the pace from two wide to be well placed and lacked a closing kick. DREAM
NAP stalked the pace from three wide through the turn and weakened in the lane. PINK LADY LU SHA was never a threat.

CANYON SHADOWS set a well rated pace on a comfortable lead, responded when called upon to be clear and continued unthreatened in a well handled
ride. GOOD YEGG settled off the pace to the turn, rallied inside saving ground and finished with good late interest to be second best. DOMINANT D stalked
the pacesetter to the top of the lane and lacked a closing bid. TIGGER ATTACK went evenly without impact. CRUZIN N CURSIN showed brief speed to be
in early contention and came up empty.

BE LUCKY hustled early from between rivals to take command shortly away from the gate, opened a wide advantage on the turn and kept-on willingly
through the lane without being challenged. STOLICH tracked the pace from the fence through the turn, cut the corner to mount a rail rally in the lane and
was along for the place. DASTARDLY DEEDS unhurried in the early going, advanced on the turn rallying five wide and made a mild bid in the lane. THE
GEEK chased the winner from three wide to the top of the lane and faded coming home. MASQUERADE BALL was outrun.

Footnotes
CODE RUNNER unhurried for the first half mile to be at the rear of the field, circled five wide on the turn to engage the leader in upper stretch, drifted in
slightly midway down the lane while dueling with the pacesetter and pulled clear late. AHEADOFTHEGAME raced off to the lead, set a well rated pace on a
clear lead to the far turn, responded when challenged in upper stretch, drifted in at the three-sixteenths pole impeding COMEDIC TIMING who was rallying
along the fence, and finished willingly as second best. STRONGER TOGETHER raced five wide the entire trip, rated off the leaders to the quarter pole and
found his best stride late to be along for the show. COMEDIC TIMING reserved off the pace through the far turn, rallied up the rail turning for home, was
caused to take up when the pacesetter lugged-in before the eighth pole, angled out to the clear and finished evenly. JEFF THE LION prompted the pace to
the far turn, lacked a response when called upon and weakened. REMEMBER THE MAINE stalked the leaders for five-eighths, dropped back on the turn
and lacked a closing bid. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN INVOLVING THE TOP PAIR, AND THE RIDER OF
COMEDIC TIMING CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RUNNER-UP FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE THREE-SIXTEENTHS POLE, UPON REVIEW THE
STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED AHEADOFTHEGAME AND PLACED HIM FOURTH.

Footnotes
DICK BEST set the pace on a well rated, well measured lead, repelled the runner-up in upper stretch and held firm through the lane. DOUBLE THUNDER
prompted the pace through the far turn, rallied to challenge turning for home, was no match for the winner and finihsed willingly to be second best. CITY OF
GOD unhurried for the first half mile to trail the field and made a late gain the be along for the show. GLOBAL EMPIRE was one-paced never posing a
threat. WHERE'D THE DAY GO stalked the pace for three-quarters and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
CHURCH PEW broke outward squeezing his outside rival, taken in hand to settle near the rear of the field, ralied on the far turn cutting the corner turning for
home, closed well up the fence through the lane, tipped out late to engage the pacesetter in deep stretch and was going away at the wire. TRIBEST (ARG)
sped to the lead in a quick first quarter, maintained a clear lead to the head of the lane, widened in upper stretch and could not hold on late in the drive.
LADY HELENA prompted the pace for five-eighths, rallied on the turn to threaten at the quarter pole and failed to sustain the bid in the lane. MS KS
DYNASTY tracked the leaders through the final turn and made a mild bid in the stretch. LEIPZIG stalked the leaders to be well palced and flattened out
coming home. TWAS LOLA broke inward laying on the inside rival causing him to be off balance away from the gate, raced five wide through the first turn
and never was involved. I'M BOX OFFICE squeezed between rivals causing the rider to take up leaving the gate, lost ground and all chance at the break
and was no factor from there. WRITTEN CONSENT raced in contention for the first half and came up empty. THE TRAINER OF I'M BOX OFFICE
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE LEAVING THE GATE, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE

W W HOTSHOT set a pressured pace to the top of the stretch, responded when called upon to open a clear advantage and maintained that lead to the wire.
DEVIL'S TOWER pressed the pace for the first half mile, could not go with the winner and kept-on willingly through the lane to hold the place. WENT WEST
tracked the top pair to upper stretch and made a mild late rally to just miss the place. MEGAN'S HONOR reserved of fthe pace through the turn, angled in in
upper stretch to mount a griding late rally. MACRON trailed for a half and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. MANTA REY hustled early to contend and was
never a threat. FIT TO FLY unprepared at the start, dropped his head when the gates opened, stumbled a step away from the gate, gathered together,
rushed up three wide to be prominent for half mile and was empty in the lane.

stalked the leaders to the top of the lane, angled out five wide and mounted a good rally while unable to get to the winner. RIVZONAROLL set the pace
under mild early pressure, opened a clear lead on the turn and had no answer when engaged in mid-stretch. THREEFIFTYSEVEN unhurried in the early
going to be near the rear of the field andmounted a good belated rally down the lane. RISKY BOY went evenly lacking a closing kick. COUNTRY GUY
chased the leaders from five wide and failed to mount a rally. READTHETRANSCRIPT contended early while caught wide and faded in the stretch. SIMPLE

Footnotes
TAP N TWINE rushed to the early lead between rivals, backed off the pace on the turn to stalk the leader, re-rallied from between rivals in upper stretch to
engage the leader inside the eighth pole and cleared in deep stretch. SHEZA HOOT reserved off the pace through the turn, angled five wide in upper stretch
and closed well to be gaining late in the drive. TOP LOOK pressed the pace from the fence for the first quarter, dropped off the pace into the turn, tipped out
to mount a mild four wide rally on the bend and flattened out in the lane. SWEET CRYSTAL pressed the pace from three wide, assumed command into the
turn, held the advantage to mid-stretch and weakened in the final eighth. JOCELYN tossed her head as the gates opened, hopped leaving the gate and lost
all chance having given the field a ten length advantage. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START INVOLVING JOCELYN, UPON
REVIEW THEY DETERMINED SHE HAD A FAIR START.

Footnotes
REGIMENTAL sped off to a clear lead while well rated, drifted out turning for home when rider lost crop, continued on willingly having responded when
called upon to draw away. SKYLANE prompted the pace from the inside into thr turn, lost positon on the bend and came on again late in the lane to re-claim
the place. GIANNO stalked the pace into the turn from three wide, mounted a mild bid on the bend and finished evenly unable to sustain the rally. BLACK
RUSSIAN failed to menace. PRINCE IS MY BOY trailed most of the way and passed a tiring rival in the stretch. MY BROTHER MIKE chased the leaders
from four wide through the turn and gave way in the lane.
