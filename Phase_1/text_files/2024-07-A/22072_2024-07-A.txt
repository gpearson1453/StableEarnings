Footnotes
DROP DEAD SEXY sprinted to a clear lead to set all the pace and proved best. ATOMIC ROSE raced in the middle of the pack to the turn then launched a
four wide bid at the three furlong marker and kept gaining to be second best. NIGHT ORB raced wide to the turn then tipped in to three wide around the turn
and made a four wide stretch rally for the show. WATCH THIS MUNNY raced in the middle of the pack to the turn and moved between horses at the three
furlong marker and showed a late kick in the stretch but just missed the show. OURPERFECTPRINCESS chased the leader from three wide to the turn then
moved in around the turn but was empty in the stretch. DONNAS FINAL WORD showed no early speed and was not a threat. FAST TRACK tracked the
leaders from two wide to the turn then saved ground around the turn and retreated. TWO HANDS FULL raced on the inside but had to check near the three
furlong marker and was not a factor. DARE TO WISH raced off the early pace from two wide then appeared to take a bad step near the three furlong marker
and was pulled up and given a ride in the equine ambulance.

Footnotes
ST PIERRE was void of speed through the first turn then steadily advanced from two wide down the backstretch, angled out to three wide on the final turn,
took command at the top of the stretch and drw off. GRAND ENCORE pressed the pace from two wide around the first turn then took the pressured lead at
the five furlong marker but was overtaken at the top of the stretch but stayed on to be second best. BELLAMY BROTHER vied for the lead from three wide
to the seven sixteenths pole then tipped in to two wide around the final turn but started to weaken and flattened out and proved best of the rest. A TRUE
TARGET stalked the pace from four wide around the first turn then made a mild three wide bid at the three furlong marker while racing evenly. MO'Z STAR
L RANSOM was rank around the first turn then pressed the pace from the inside down the backstretch but was done at the half mile marker.

MOION pressed the pace from the inside to the top of the stretch then took the lead and drew clear. MAJESTIC TORNADO raced close up on the pace then
made a three wide bid at the quarter pole to engage the leader but was no match for the winner. CAT ISLAND EXPRESS raced near the back to the turn
then made a mild bid on the turn and tipped out to four wide in upper stretch for the rally. OVER THE CLOUDS went to a pressured lead but was collared at
the quarter pole and gave way grudgingly. INDIAN SPIRIT tracked the leaders from the inside and failed to menace. ROYAL ARTS raced off the pace from
three wide and faded. SHELLEY'S ROSE showed little. TWIDDLY was never a threat. TRUST FUND BABY trailed.

SHE BADGER went four wide into the first turn then was forwardly placed from three wide down the backstretch and moved up to press the pace from two
wide near the half mile marker and took the lead at the three furlong marker, edged away on the turn and drew clear in the stretch and held sway. QUEEN
OF THE MOON was allowed to settle around the first turn then moved up from three wide at the half mile marker to circle the field and was gaining on the
leader but couldn't catch and proved second best. OAK HILL SENIORITA chased the leaders through the final turn then angled out to three wide in upper
stretch and saved the show. AURORA AUSTRALIS sprinted to the front to set the pace for a half then was headed at the three furlong marker and
weakened. DADDY'S CINDERELLA saved ground to no avail.

the final turn then made a strong rail bid in the stretch to be second best. OAK HILL LG raced off the pace to midway down the backstretch then fell back
going into the final turn moved up from three wide on the final turn and made the late bid in the stretch but missed the place. COOKN WIT CATMAN stalked
the pace from three wide, moved up on the backstretch but lacked the late response. DEBATER cut the corner to take the early lead around the first turn
