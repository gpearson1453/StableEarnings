CHROME'S BIG BREAK showed speed from the outside, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the
win. THIS ONE CAN RUN tracked the early leaders from the outside and was a factor on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch just missed.
SO BREANNA was in touch, raced evenly from between foes on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch held show. MY GIRL GABBY was
off the pace, saved ground on the turn and was up for a share. PEACE IN PARADISE stalked the leader from the inside and was hustled along on the turn
but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. FORMENTOR was unhurried early and roused on the turn but from the seven path at the top
of the stretch had no response.

back, trailed the field on the far turn and was never a threat.

HICKSY set a pressured pace, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch prevailed. BEYOND MY DREAMS was up close,
raced evenly on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch finished well. GENERAL COMMAND was in mid pack and moved up from the inside
on the turn but needed more. BOXER BRIEF forced the early pace and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had nothing
left. POLITICAL settled off the pace and saved ground on the turn but was no real threat. PRIVATE NETWORK showed no speed and was roused on the
turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no rally. HADDASSAH'S DEVIL was off slow and hustled along on the turn but from the seven path at
the top of the stretch was no factor.

pace and had a clear lead on the turn but was headed in mid stretch while all out. WICKEN CENTS was off the pace, saved ground on the turn and was up
for show. FRAULEIN VICTORIA was hustled early and roused from the inside on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick.
CALM COOL was unhurried early and had a mild gain on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. BAMBOO'S BABE was well
back, trailed the field on the turn and was not a factor. FREED BY MAGIC was in mid pack and hustled along on the turn but from the four path at the top of
the stretch had no impact.

Footnotes
PRIVATE LAKE was in range, moved up on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. OCTOBER FROST was in touch,
roused on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for place. BIG BROWN BREWSKII settled off the pace, gained ground on the
far turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch finished well. REDOUTE'S LIGHT was unhurried early and had a mild gain on the far turn but from
the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. BOCELLI stalked the early leader and was a factor on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the
stretch leveled off. THELONIOUS was up close but chased on the far turn and was no real threat. DIAMONDBACK set the pace and had the lead on the far
turn but gave way at the top of the stretch. LOQUACIOUS was well back and showed little in a dull effort. CRYPTIC CREED was hustled early but lost
ground on the far turn, was eased to the wire and walked off. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON REDOUTE'S LIGHT AGAINST BOTH BIG BROWN
BREWSKII AND PRIVATE LAKE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED
