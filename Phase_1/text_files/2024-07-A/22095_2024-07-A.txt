ROCKNSOCKCONECTION led the way racing up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and held clear to the wire. BEGGIN FOR TROUBLE hit
the gate leaving it, stalked the leader between horses racing up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and kept on to the finish. PIERRE
NOEL stalked the leader on the outside through the opening quarter, came around the turn in the three path and chased on to the finish. BOULEVARD
BOSS tracked the leader between horses up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and weakened in the final furlong. MOE DINGERS
raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and showed no kick. WOCKA WOCKA raced off the pace between
horses early, came around the turn in the three path and made no bid. BLUSHING BEE trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the
