Footnotes
GALACTIC EMPIRE saved ground around the pace, stalked two wide up the backstretch, moved up and took over the lead mid-way around the far turn,
came two wide into upper stretch, hustled along and widened to a clear advantage then tapped once in the final furlong and finished ridden out.
ASSUMPTION was unhurried and saved ground through early stages, picked up the pace near the half mile marker, gained between rivals around the far
turn, hustled along three wide into upper stretch, sustained bid and cleared second best. SUBURBAN PRINCE tracked the pace three wide up the
backstretch, urged to pick up the pace around the far turn, ran on three to four wide through the lane and secured a share. JUST JOHNNY vied for the lead
around the first turn and continued to match strides to the midway point up the backstretch, weakened along the inside around the far turn and was no late
threat. APOLLO BAY trailed in the back, came two wide into upper stretch and lacked a rally. RIVERSPORT vied for the lead around the first turn, shook
free mid-way up the backstretch, led the way then got collared by the winner mid-way around the far turn and steadily retreated. This race had a timing
discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
LAVENDER LIL was unhurried and raced in the back, edged closer late on the far turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, gathered momentum under
steady pressure, edged ahead leaving the sixteenth pole and finished clear. REBEL RISING settled off the early pace, picked up the tempo two wide late on
the far turn, came three paths wide into upper stretch,, roused forward under a drive, briefly held the lead past the furlong marker then got overtaken by the
winner near the final sixteenth. JAYDENSQUEENOHARTS stalked the early pace, moved up mid-way around the far turn, dueled for the lead past the
furlong marker then failed to move on for the late lead, ran on and secured a share. MY HAPPINESS pressed the pace around the first turn and up the
backstretch, vied for the lead around the far turn, battled on to the furlong marker then weakened. STYLISH STYLE tracked the early pace, loomed up four
wide to race in striking distance at the quarter pole, evened out entering upper stretch and had no late kick. BAYLEYWICK set a pressured pace around the
first turn and up the backstretch, dueled around the final turn, battled back to the furlong marker then came up tired.

handled, pulled away in hand and wrapped up late. WICKLOW LADDIE raced in the back, picked up the pace along the rail entering upper stretch, was no
match for winner but dug inand captured place. MIDNIGHT RULES raced off the pace, swung four wide into upper stretch, gathered momentum along the
outside and got up late for show. STROLLER BOY rated along the inside, hustled up two wide late on the far turn, ran on into the lane, got edged for show
and finished on equal terms with CASA LIMON for fourth. CASA LIMON vied for the early lead, could not match past the three eighths pole but ran on in
contention, stayed on into stretch run then flattened and finished on equal terms with STROLLER BOY for fourth. SKALKAHO tracked the top pair up the
backstretch, chased three wide around the final turn then weakened in the lane. KILLIAN raced near midpack, hustled along two wide into upper stretch and
