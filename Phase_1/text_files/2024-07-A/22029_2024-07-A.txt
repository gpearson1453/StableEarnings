Footnotes
INDY'S STAR pressed between then got put in a bit tight and had to chase the top pair up the backstretch, waited behind the leaders two to three wide on
the turn, angled out into the clear approaching the stretch, cleared at the three-sixteenths pole and powered away under urging and was ridden out to the
wire. DRAMATIZER broke out, chased from off the pace, traveled two to three wide on the turn, angled out near the five-sixteenths pole, offered a mild rally
and bested the rest. ALOHA KITTEN vied three deep then dueled outside SOUL SWEET on the backstretch, put a head front around the turn, lost
command in upper stretch, weakened in the furlong grounds but managed to save third. GYPSY LYNN forwardly placed outside the top pair, rounded the
bend four then five wide and weakened in the stretch. SOUL SWEET vied for the lead from inside, dueled with ALOHA KITTEN around the bend, could not
kick on with the new leader at the three-sixteenths pole and faded down the lane. SOLID TUNE allowed to settle well off the rail, chased five wide into the
turn, moved into the four path then got floated out late on the bend and came up empty in the drive.

between rivals, remained three deep around the bend but with open air to his outside, inched ahead in upper stretch, maintained a narrow lead into the final
furlong but succumbed to the pressure late. ECHO ALPHA SIX chased behind the speed battle to the turn, went two, three, then four wide around the bend,

into the lane and failed to threaten when weakening under a drive.

ISLAND LIFE showed the way early under pressure from outer rival, cleared at the five-sixteenths pole and led three wide into the lane, kept busy through
the lane and held safely in the closing stages. TROUBLE N PARADISE broke well then pressed the pace from outside, lost touch with ISLAND LIFE at the
five-sixteenths pole, chased four wide into the lane, finished willingly in the furlong grounds to gain some ground and retained second. DALLAS ALICE
chased three wide into the turn, moved into the two path around the bend, tipped back out into the lane, offered a mild rally but could not get by TROUBLE
N PARADISE for second. DANCE KID antsy in the gate, stalked two wide leaving the backstretch, moved to the rail to save ground and lacked further
response. CHOLLIMA chased two wide into the turn, angled out wide around the bend and failed to threaten. TROJAN WAY stalked along the inside,
paused entering the turn, moved off the fence in the lane and lacked a rally. MS PARKSIDE tracked four deep leaving the backstretch, chased three deep
on the turn, tipped out into the lane and faded.

SMARTY NOSE unhurried in the early going, traveled two wide briefly on the turn then steered out, raced wide into the stretch, closed well from outside and
overhauled the top pair late. RES IPSA LOQUITUR broke out and bumped rival, went up to vie for the lead between rivals, drifted into the stretch, resisted
into the final sixteenth but could not fend off the winner. ACCELERAY vied for command three deep, got floated out leaving the bend, kept the pressure on
the runner-up into deep stretch but failed to summon the needed late punch. FEROCIOUSLY bumped both sides leaving the gate, got put in tight between
runners shortly after, went three wide around the turn, steered out approaching the stretch, launched a bid but flattened in the late stages. DRUMADOON
away quickest, vied inside a pair of rivals, kept on to the eighth pole, then weakened in the furlong grounds. DONTTESTYOURLUCK broke well and was
forwardly placed before climbing a bit when hit with kickback and lost ground, moved to the inside, got crowded early on the bend, angled out and went four
wide into the lane, steered out further at the three-sixteenths pole and could not rally. FORDY G got pinballed at the start, put in tight early, chased outside a
rival then two wide into the turn, tipped four wide around the bend while moving into range but flattened out in the final rounds. ANYOTHERQUESTIONS
broke in and bumped, chased from off the pace, went four wide into the turn, shifted to the three path around the bend, tipped back out into the drive, drifted
inward in the lane and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
LETSHAVEONEMORE sat off the pace, went between rivals two wide into the turn, moved to the rail around the bend, steered out in the lane, closed in
then surged in the final sixteenth and got up in time. THE BIG CHEESEOLA vied outside several rivals while between early briefly then dueled inside POP
D'ORO up the backstretch, continued on even terms around the bend and two wide into the stretch, lost command and fought back to regain the advantage
midstretch, held a narrow lead into the closing moments but got run down by the winner. POP D'ORO vied six deep for a bit then fought outside THE BIG
CHEESEOLA up the backstretch, battled two then three wide around the turn, inched ahead to take control from that rival, gave the lead back in midstretch,
fought gamely to the wire but was outkicked in the end. LEADING THE PACE showed early speed then chased the top pair in the early going, traveled three
wide then angled five wide into the lane, came with a late bid and missed third. SKY CLOUD stumbled leaving the gate, chased along the inside, cut the
corner into the stretch, came with a mild late bid but was not enough. DO IT FOR DAVE lacked early speed, trailed on the inside into the turn, eased off the
rail and came three wide into the stretch and improved position. CONSTANT CONFLICT stumbled a bit at the start, laid off the pace, went three wide into
the turn, angled out around the bend and failed to menace. WINNING BIG displayed brief speed then chased off the rail, took the turn three then two wide,
tipped out in the lane and weakened. DES DOIGTS showed early speed between rivals then ceded command, chased four to five wide and and also
weakened in the lane.

NOSTRI VIRES vied for the lead from inside, drifted into the stretch, dueled with LIL' BOOM BOOM and proved best in the final furlong. LIL' BOOM BOOM
vied between rivals, fought three wide into the lane, dueled outside NOSTRI VIRES in the drive and was outkicked in the final furlong. AMELIA'S ECHO
chased four wide leaving the backstretch, angled in a few paths around the bend, finished well and gained the show honors. GODAVRI off slow and lost
path at the start, tracked two then three wide, swung seven wide leaving the bend, closed well but got edged for third. THIRSTY DESTINY chased from
inside, cornered nicely into the lane and kept trying through the final furlong while needing to find more late. ON TIME TAM broke slow and shifted out,
trailed up the backstretch and steered across to the inside, eased off the fence around the bend and passed tired rivals down the lane. BUDS N SUDS
broke a length slow, traveled near the back two wide into the turn, moved over to the rail around the bend and offered a mild response to improve position.
GRACIE'S BIG DAY vied between early then had to check from the half-mile pole to the seven-sixteenths marker, angled out around the bend and came
eight wide into the stretch and could not rally after. GOBERNADORA ELY forwardly placed from outside, bid four deep at the three eighths pole, fought six
wide into the drive and weakened. I HAVE A DREAM vied four deep early then three deep up the backstretch, got floated out out still battling for command
and entered the lane in the five path, then tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
QUANTUM INNERGY bumped leaving the gate and trailed early, split foes making progress in the two path on the turn, rallied inside the leader in the lane
and drew clear in deep stretch. SHES JUST FLUFFY forwardly placed from inside then went two wide into he turn, took aim three wide into the stretch,
lacked the needed late punch in the furlong grounds but finished determinedly to regain the place honors. NO CAP vied briefly for command then cleared to
take control, led along the rail then came off the fence a bit entering the lane, roused in upper stretch, headed at the eighth pole, yielded to the winner
shortly after and lost second. FLYMETOTHEMOONBABY raced in range between foes into the turn, rounded the bend two to three wide, angled five wide
into the lane and lacked a bid. ACT OF SERENDIPITY chased off the rail then angled in, saved ground to the stretch and lacked the needed response when
asked. UNCONTROLLABLE reluctant to load, sat off the pace on the inside, trailed into the stretch and passed tired rivals. BLACKJACK BETTY away
quickly, raced up close outside the pacesetter then chased that rival up the backstretch, took the turn three then four wide and weakened in the lane. SHE'S
A JOKER broke in and bumped the winner, chased five wide into the turn, six wide into the lane and weakened. RYDER'S CANDY chased three deep or
four wide into the turn, exited the bend six wide and tired.

Footnotes
SWEET AZTECA raced up close inside DADDYSRUBY then switched to the outside, drew alongside with three furlongs remaining, raced on even terms at
the three-sixteenths pole, drove clear approaching the furlong grounds and was geared down late while setting a new track record. DADDYSRUBY sped
clear and set the pace up the backstretch, met the bid from SWEET AZTECA on the turn, resisted to the three-sixteenths pole, yielded to the winner with a
furlong remaining and kept to task for a clear second. SUPER SHINE (ARG) broke slow and veered to the inside, trailed up the backstretch, passed a pair
of rivals three wide on the turn, summoned a mild rally and bested the rest. OLIVIA TWIST had to steady briefly when SWEET AZTECA came over early,
traveled near mid-pack two then three wide on the turn, angled out into the stretch, could not rally in the final furlong but managed to earn a minor award.
GETTHEMONEY raced in range three wide into the turn, spun four wide into the lane and weakened. IRISH WAHINE drifted in early then got put in tight
between rivals and checked, raced out of range well off the inside, navigated turn four then five wide and failed to menace. CHISMOSA sat off the pace,
drew closer three wide on the turn, moved out further at the top of the lane but flattened out in the drive. ANYWHO got crowded between rivals early,
recovered and moved forward while angling to the inside, started to lose ground and put to right handed urging past the five-sixteenths pole, cut the corner
into the lane and faded. YUKI (CHI) lost her path early, chased under coaxing two wide into the turn, lost ground and raced outside a rival at the back into
the lane and tired. THREE WITCHES tracked the speed from inside then chased from off the pace leaving the backstretch, dropped back to last around the
bend and had little left for the drive.
