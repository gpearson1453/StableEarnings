Footnotes
FLATOUTSASSYOK quickly sprinted well clear after an alert break, continued to hold a sizable advantage into the turn, responded when the runner up
moved closer late in the bend, cut the corner to extend the advantage over that same rival into the lane, held sway in the late going under steady handling.
UNBRIDLED KISSES last to leave, moved up steadily to chase the winner into the turn, closed the gap on that one by late in the bend, lost some ground in
the three path entering the stretch, slowly coming back in the waning strides while too late. HI LEE FAVOREDCATS went one paced throughout in lacking a
serious closing response. SWEETASLIFECANBE chased the winner off the inside in the early going, began a steady fade after a quarter to trail home. This
race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
TRUE DOMINUS narrowly set the pace along the inside, relinquished the advantage to the winner three furlongs out, fell back off that rival and another foe
into the far turn, came back to be a clear second while no match for the winner. FATHER PATRICK last away, continued unhurried for over a half, staged a
mild, belated rally to be along for the show while not a threat to the top two. BORN TOUGH pressed the runner up from the outside for a half and began to
weaken, stopped through the stretch to finish far back. TRAFFIC BOSS pressed the issue for five furlongs while three wide and between foes, took over
midway up the backstretch the second time, steadily increased that advantage to the wire while being kept to task. AMMENTHEDESTROYER vied up front
four wide through the first two turns, chased the winner when that one took the advantage into and through the final turn, faltered in the drive to lose the
place. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

HOT TUB HOTTIE broke well, vied out of the chute closest to the inside, separated from the rest before a quarter, breather through the turn, cruised home
through the lane. SODDY DAISY broke with the winner, raced on equal terms with that one out of the chute, lost contact with that one before a quarter,
chased that one home in vain, clear for the place. SCARLET POSITION in the second flight early along the inside, continued to save ground turn, came up
empty for the drive. HEY ROXY steadily faded while racing three wide. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video

Footnotes
FORTY STRANGERS within striking distance early, crept closer in the far turn, engaged the leader from the outside turning for home and wore that rival
down under firm handling. WAR HAWK broke on top, cleared past the wire the first time, set a pressured pace up the backstretch, responded when the
winner came calling exiting the final bend and gave ground grudgingly while proving determined for the place late. KYEMBEA last away, lacked speed for a
half, advanced along the inside, lodged a bid for the place late, outfinished. WRISTBAND settled off the pace and the inside, continued in even fashion the
middle half mile, advanced when asked into the far turn, lacked a closing punch to be outkicked for the show spot. E D'ORO pressured the runner up from
the outside, challenged between that one and the winner turning into the stretch, faltered in the late going. LUCKY MCCOY fell back off the early back to
trail into the first turn, continued to lack speed, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and
was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
EXPLOSIVE PRIDE forwardly placed from the start in the two path, put a head in front midway on the turn, edged away through the lane while being kept to
pressure. OOEY GOOEY CHEWY closest to the dueling leaders, came three wide for the drive, up late for the place to gain the nod, not a serious threat to
the winner. STOOPS SINE DIE showed the way out of the chute, dueled into and through much of the turn, first to blink entering the stretch, continued to
gradually weaken, caught late for the place. LOCK UP YOUR PETS last away, continued to lack speed, displayed some mild, belated interest. MONEY
EXPRESS went one paced while off the inside, three wide turn, lacked a closing kick. IRA CHAMP mid pack, four wide through the turn, lacked a closing
response while racing outside. MISTER TYRO fell back to trail after the start and was never a threat. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and
was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

CLASSY EDGE hopped at the start, took control past the wire the first time, continued to show the way through the first turn, extended that advantage in the
run up the backstretch and continued to widen to the wire under steady handling. COWGIRLSLIKEBLING settled off the early pace while off the inside, four
wide through the first turn, took over as the winner's closest pursuer after three furlongs, proved no match the final quarter, clearly second best. ANNA UP
void of speed for a half, called on for some run final turn while off the inside, along for the show while not a threat to the top pair. FLY FENIX FLY closest to
the winner for a half, gave way along the inside in the far turn. IMA HAPPY DANCER last away, was never a serious threat. This race had a timing
discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
DOCTOR TINK broke running from the outside, set all the pace toward the inside, pulled away through the lane and was clearly best. KICK IT AGAIN BOB
was asked for some run early to maintain contact with the winner, continued to race within striking distance into the far turn, could do nothing with the winner
through the stretch, far clear of the others. HE'S ALL EARS went one paced in the three path throughout, nothing for the top two in the stretch, all out to
narrowly hold the show. JUST OKIE four wide trip throughout, lacked a rally to miss the show. LA BATALLA rank early, pulled up into the first turn, jogged
back. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

FLY TO THE BANK asked for some run away from the gate, was outrun into the first turn while saving ground, tipped out three wide when advancing late in
the final turn, set down for the drive and kicked down the leader under brisk handling. MISTER WAYSIDE away in good order, stalked the leader while
closest to that one for a half, collared that rival and quickly shook clear into the lane, continued to lead late, could not contain the winner in the final strides,
remained sell clear of the rest. SIDETOWN asked away from the gate, cleared toward the inside late on the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch
while saving ground, relented readily to the runner up when that one challenged second turn, could not match the winner through the lane, comfortably
saved the show. BRAINSTORM settled off the pace, had little for the drive when called on final turn. HACKER was finished early, trailed home. This race
had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
DAKOTA MARVIN wrested control soon after the start, set a pressured pace up the backstretch, disposed of that foe turning for home, then held the runner
up comfortably safe under steady handling. SUPERHERO settled in the second flight inside, continued to save ground the middle part, staged a mild rally
up the inside to gain the place, not a serious threat to the winner in the waning strides. DIAMONDS R LUCKY forwardly placed early while five wide into the
first turn, advanced to press the winner onto the backstretch, continued to apply pressure the next furlong then began to weaken turning for home. TAKING
ENERGY settled in the second flight while outside the runner up, asked along into the far turn, lacked a significant closing response despite firm handling.
PRINCE PIERRE broke with the field, fell back, failed to menace through the stretch. RAGING THUNDER lacked early foot, failed to rally when called upon.
CHRISTIAN STREET was finished before a half, well back. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to
arrive at the most accurate time.
