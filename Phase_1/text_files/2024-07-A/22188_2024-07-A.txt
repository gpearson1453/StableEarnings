GALLANT STAR stalked the pace from two wide around the first turn then was allowed to settle off the pace down the backstretch, moved up at the half
mile marker to run down the leader at the eighth pole and was up in the final jumps. DUKE OF BLUE RIDGE bobbled slightly leaving the gate but recovered
and went to a clear lead to set most of the pace but was headed at the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. JUJU NINETEEN was allowed to settle around
the first turn the made a mild bid on the backstretch and flattened out. GOTTATAKEHIMTO raced at or near the back and passed tiring rival. ARCTIC ROSE
stalked the pace from the inside to the five sixteenths pole and retreated.

was no match for the top two. CHROME CANDY was void of speed and outrun. PAPA FLEW BOMBERS broke alertly but dropped back while saving

LONGLEGGEDLAVERNE prompted the pace from two wide down the backstretch then moved up to take command at the three furlong marker and drew
clear to prove best. IZEONPOINT stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch then shifted out to the two path midway through the final turn and
tipped out to three wide at the quarter pole but couldn't catch the leader and proved second best. CARPE HORSESHOE sprinted to the lead to set the pace
for a half but was over taken near the three furlong marker and weakened. OUR LITTLE GIRL was unhurried down the backstretch but made a mild rail bid
on the final turn and passed tiring rival in the drive. FROSTY FLIRT raced off the pace from three wide to the final turn and was done.

Footnotes
CHAPELLETE was unhurried around the first turn then moved up between horses nearing the half mile marker, kept on tipping out to three wide at the
quarter pole and moved out farther to make a mid track rally in the stretch and was up in the final jumps. ADAMANTLY stalked the pace from two wide down
the backstretch then move up to engage the leader midway through the final turn but floated out to mid track entering the stretch but kept on to take the lead
near the eighth pole but was denied late. DOMINA tracked the leaders from the inside through the final turn and made a late bid but was outfinished by the
late closing rival. MY BUTTERFLY rushed to a clear lead to the three furlong marker then was headed midway through the turn, kept on but was empty late.
MRS. MACOMBER raced in the middle of the pack from two wide to the half mile marker but failed to menace. CHARLIE'S GAL was allowed to settle
around the first turn then steadily advanced down the backstretch to be in contention on the final turn but faltered. RADIANT REBEL was always back.

draw clear in early stretch and held well late. CONNOR TALKSTRASH raced four wide down the backstretch then moved in to three wide around the turn
but shifted back out to four wide in upper stretch to make the late rally to be second best. ALL IN GOOD TIME raced off the pace from three to four wide
through the turn and made a late run but was outkicked late. WILDCATS'S MEOW pressed the pace from the inside to the half mile marker then fell back on
the turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. MO'Z STAR CROSS was reluctant to load the was hustled to a clear lead on the turn but was collared at the
quarter pole and tired. MEDAL OF HONOR showed early speed from two wide to the half mile marker and retreated. R FIFTEEN raced four wide on the
backstretch then was taken up entering the turn and was distanced, pulled up and given a ride in the equine ambulance.

TIZ SWEET CANDY broke sharply, pressed the pace from two wide to the turn then took the lead at the three furlong marker and drew off upper stretch and
fended of the late closer. FUNTIMEGIRL raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then launched a bid at the three furlong marker, going three
wide at the quarter pole to make the late gain on the leader but was not enough. LITTLE Z hopped leaving the gate and raced back through the turn but
showed the late run moving between horses at the eighth pole while giving a game effort. TWISTED BRADE chased the leaders from the middle of the pack
and failed to menace. BIDOFHONEY rushed to a pressured lead to the three furlong marker where she was headed but she kept on and tired in early
stretch. VALLEJO trailed the field and was outrun.

Footnotes
WARTIME HERO raced in the middle of the pack on the inside down the backstretch then moved out to three wide going into the final turn and kept moving
up to run down the leader to draw clear late. WIN WORTHY was off slow and trailed the field down the backstretch, saved ground around the final turn then
moved out to five wide in upper stretch to make a late rally to finish strong. MORE ICE stalked the pace from the inside through the turn then engaged the
leader in upper stretch to take a brief lead before being eclipsed at the sixteenth pole and gave way grudginly. CHIEF ALPHA was allowed to settle around
the first turn then steadily advanced through the final turn, moved between horses at the eighth pole but was outfinished in the final yards. HE GOTS TO GO
raced near the back from two wide down the backstretch moved up from three wide at the half mile marker, angled out to six wide in upper stretch but
finished evenly. HARD LOVE rushed away to a clear lead to set most of the pace but was overtaken after three quarters and tired late. MY UNCLE LEON
raced off the pace around the first turn then dropped back and was distanced, eased, walked off.
