PAYNTED WARRIOR sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway unchallenged, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task.
VALENTINE BUG well placed and inside, held position on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and
edged up for the place late. GOOSE HUNTER unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, angled
out for clear racing room, made a steady gain and edged up for the show. YOU MUST CHILL well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide
through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, evened the final furlong and held a share. EPIC LUCK mid pack, looped up three and four wide
through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and had no rally. COLONEL POPPY hard to rate in the early going, angled out through the first
turn, lost some position through the second turn, then faded into the stretch. YOUMUSTBEA WEASLEY was never involved.

CHANGE THE HOUR vied for the early lead inside, held position through the turn, came through inside the leader, shook clear, then drew off and was kept
to the task. MAC'S CAT mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and closed well for the place. EMMA AT
THE GATE rated close up and inside, held position on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, then could not gain the final
furlong and held the show. MICHAELSHATRICK unhurried, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled
out and got up for a share. THAT'S JUST GREAT mid pack, moved up inside through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened
the final furlong. CROWNING PRINCE well placed and outside, lost some position three wide through the turn, then weakened four wide in the lane. GRUIT
passed tiring rivals, inside. EXCLUSIVE ENTRY set the pace off the rail, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. TALE OF
THE DRAGON was never involved.
