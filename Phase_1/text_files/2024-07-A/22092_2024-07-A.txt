TALK MUCH set the pace well off the rail bearing out, angled in into the turn holding a clear lead, then turned back a late bid at the furlong marker, shook
clear, then drew off under steady pressure. SO MOXIE well placed and off the rail, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch,
then was no threat to the winner while closing well for the place. SCENIC VIEW rated inside, steadied on heels into the turn, angled three wide into the
stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the show. MOLISE well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into
the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. STRAIGHT MADNESS ran evenly. ALL ABOUT KATHERN was never involved.
