DON'T MISS OUT bore in early, bothering foes, led in the two path and drew off under a steady drive. SEVEN ANNS stalked the early pace inside, backed
off the pace, bid inside, shifted to the four path at the eighth pole, closed and gained the place. THEHILLONWOODSIDE bid in the four path, pressed the
pace around the turn and gave way in the stretch. VICTORY WALTZ stalked the pace in the two path and was through early. TIZNTSHELOVELY was
herded in early, raced five wide but had no closing bid. WINTER WAVES was squeezed back early, raced five wide but had no bid. MARY LOVES LOUIE
stalked the early pace between rivals and gave way on the turn. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF TIZNTSHELOVELY AGAINST THE
