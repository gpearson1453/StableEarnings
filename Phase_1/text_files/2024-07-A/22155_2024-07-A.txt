LETS ROCK N STROLL rated just off the pace while saving ground, tipped two wide and made a move leaving the turn, roused forward to challenge for the
lead at the furlong marker, edged away on top then quickly came back under pressure, dug in and held on. RAYS BIG DREAM was forwardly placed from
the onset, was ridden along three wide late on the turn, moved up to challenge for the lead at the eighth pole, failed to move on with LETS ROCK N
STROLL then dug back in stubbornly, moved back up into striking distance and just missed. PURE CRYSTAL vied outside of FLEETWOOD SMACK in
early stages, shook free near the quarter pole, got overtaken by outside duo at the furlong marker and flattened out. DIXIE THREE G was unhurried and
settled in the back, picked up the pace late on the turn, came five paths turning for home, drifted in and bumped PAPA JOJO at the head of the lane and
never threatened. PAPA JOJO raced in range, hustled along three to four wide and flattened a bit late on the turn, came four wide into upper stretch, took a
solid bump from DIXIE THREE G and steadily weakened. FLEETWOOD SMACK vied inside of PURE CRYSTAL for the early lead, came up empty late on
the turn and continued to tire in the drive. STEWARDS POSTED INQUIRY AND RIDER OF PAPA JOJO CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST DIXIE THREE FOR
INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH, AFTER REVIEW DIXIE THREE G WAS FOUND GUILTY AND WAS DISQAULIFIED FROM FOURTH AND
PLACED FIFTH

HEY was forwardly placed in opening stages, moved up to engage rivals for the lead at the quarter pole, battled outside of BIG SWAY to the sixteenth pole,
dug in gamely under right handed pressure, shook free and finished clear. F B I BOB raced off the early speed and saved ground, angled out and launched
a two wide bid at the head of the lane, finished with good response and got a nose up to capture place. BIG SWAG held a slim lead going into the turn, took
on rivals from both sides at the quarter pole, dueled two wide into the lane, batted on with HEY to the sixteenth pole, failed to move on with the winner then
got nipped for place in final stride. EXCELLENT EMPIRE was forwardly placed from the onset, moved up to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, vied
past the furlong marker then flattened late. ABLE SEAMAN was not too far back early on, chased three then two wide around the turn then failed to move on
in the lane. CASH'S PAL was not too far back into the turn, came three wide into upper stretch and gave way. SAMMY'S A GIVINE saved ground and never
menaced. FIRST MERCHANT trailed throughout. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at
the most accurate time.

ROCK CITY ROCKET held a slim lead in opening stages then vied inside of COST BASIS up the backstretch and around the turn, shook free to a slim lead
at the head of the lane and fought on gamely. COST BASIS vied outside of ROCK CITY ROCKET up the backstretch and around the turn, could not match
strides at the head of the lane, but ran on with response, continued in striking range and held place. MO'S MOJO began to engage the top pair for the lead
along the rail then edged back and tracked the top pair into the turn, waited for a path briefly while running inside of CASPER JUSTICE in the upper stretch,
launched a three wide bid a furlong out and finished with good response. CASPER JUSTICE tracked the pace up the backstretch and around the turn,
hustled along three wide into upper stretch, remained in contention past the furlong marker then flattened out. I'M CRENSHAW settled off the early pace,
was ridden along three wide into the upper stretch and had a mild improve. SAILOR CHOW raced off the top two flights into the turn, hustled along three to
four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. WHEELER DEALER raced off pace, came four to five wide into the lane and never threatened. KOSELIO
failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
MEGATAP settled around the first turn, steadily picked up the pace up the backstretch, swept by to take control over the lead near the quarter pole, came
three wide into the lane, tapped once in the final furlong then finished in hand. NASTY EXAGGERATOR stalked the early pace, saved ground on the final
turn, launched a two wide bid at the head of the lane and finished clearly second best. MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE raced off the early pace, swung four
wide into upper stretch and got a nose up for show. ONE TIME GEM settled early then hustled up three wide around the far turn, gained position then kept
on three wide and got nipped for show. POKER PLAY sped to the lead soon after the start and widened to a clear advantage around the first turn, continued
clear up the backstretch, got collared by the winner at the quarter pole, ran on to the furlong marker then gave way. RESOLUTIONIST settled through early
stages, was ridden along two wide around the far turn, gained position then faded in the lane. PROMISING SHOES failed to move into contention. HEZA
WILD RIDE raced in range in early stages then steadily retreated.

to reach the winner in time. C R INSTA GATOR led the way around the first turn then came under pressure from WEARACAP, vied inside of rival around
the far turn, battled on gamely past the furlong marker then gave way grudgingly. DINNER AT CRUMPIES settled and saved ground through early stages,

Footnotes
SUPER MODEL STROLL lacked speed and raced four wide in the back, continued to trail into the turn, shifted out six paths wide at the head of the lane,
kicked in gamely, surged fast along the outside and got up in final stride. NEW YEAR'S BELLE set the pace through early going, continued on top around
the turn, vied for the lead inside of SHES MY KINDA GIRL in late stages and got caught when the winner surged by. SHE'S MY KINDAGIRL pressed the
pace in opening stages then continued up close around the turn, vied outside of NEW YEARS BELLE for the late lead, got edged by the winner approaching
the wire and lost the head bob for place. HOODWICKED was ridden along just off midpack through early stages, hustled along four wide into upper stretch
and finished with response. SUPINE DUCHESS raced in range, chased three to four wide around the turn then flattened in the lane. MY FOUR POINT OH
raced near midpack, hustled up along the inside around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, kept under firm handling into upper stretch but had no
kick. NATIVE QUEEN raced off the early pace, saved ground and lacked a rally. CANADIAN JANE was ridden along off the pace, came three wide into the
lane and never threatened. OPAL BAY chased along the outside and failed to move into close contention. SKIPER STROLL chased up close through early
stages, came up empty late on the turn and retreated in the lane.
