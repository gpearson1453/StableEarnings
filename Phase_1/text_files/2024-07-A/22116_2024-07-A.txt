WOOD RIVER was void of any early speed, saved ground into the home turn, found room along the inside while advancing, took control late and was clear.
MY PAL SWEET set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the home turn, kept on, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best.
OVERANALYTICAL pressed the early pace, advanced four wide into the second turn, finished evenly late and finished a game third. DUMBSTRUCK was
allowed to settle early, raced along the inside into the second turn, angled out through the turn and offered a mild late rally. FIRST CLASS HARLOW was
unhurried early, raced six wide through the second turn and finished belatedly. INSIGNIS tracked the early pace, raced five wide into the second turn and
was empty. RIVER RAFT raced in mid pack early, raced five wide through the second turn, drifted in through the stretch and never fired. OLD SOT was

Footnotes
SIX STRING pressed the early pace, raced four wide through the turn, took control mid stretch and edged clear. JUMPIN JUDY set a pressured early pace,
raced three wide into the turn, was no match late and finished second best. SWEET TEMPERAMENT tracked the early pace, raced five wide and finished
evenly late. FREE DROP MADDY was void of any early speed, advanced along the inside, was gaining late and needed more ground. RUE LALA was
allowed to settle early, raced three wide and offered no late rally. FOURALIVIA was outrun early, went five wide into the turn and never fired.
LOVELYREDSTILETTOS raced in mid pack early, raced erratic through the turn and was finished early. SUMMER SHOES was unhurried early, raced six
wide and was no factor.
