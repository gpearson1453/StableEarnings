drifted in under steady pressure. MAGNUS EFFECT tracked the pace well back, angled out to the two path and moved up through the second turn, angled
four wide into the stretch, drifted in and closed well for the place. ELEVATED CAUSEWAY well placed and outside, gained a striking position two and three

unhurried, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch and got up for a share. LUCIOS ZORAN hard to rated, sprinted away to a
long lead, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. IMPOSING RULER was never involved. WARRIOR'S SPECIAL was no

COURT AND SPARK rated between, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew off
late. STANHOPE hopped at the start, moved up quickly to set the pace inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then was no match late, while
clearly best of the rest. GREY CHARMER unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, veered in and closed
well for the show. LOADED SNIPER well placed and outside, lost some ground three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and weakened,

RICHARD HOOTY rated back early, moved up inside through the second turn, angled four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove clear late.

challenged into the stretch, turned back a bid, shook clear, then weakened the final sixteenth and held the show. JO JO HANS well placed and off the rail,
moved up into the second turn, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then weakened the

Footnotes
BOURBON BLAST unhurried, looped up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, angled widest for clear racing room, closed fast,
edged ahead final strides. A KISS FOR KHOZAN stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the
stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead late and was outfinished. QUEEN WIGGY eased to a clear lead after the start, drew off through the turn, then
weakened late and held the show. LET'S BE HONEST well placed and off the rail, looped three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch,
drifted out and weakened. CHEROKEE CHATTER tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch, lost her path, angled back
in and flattened the final furlong. MISS GETTY UP ran evenly. RUNAWAY BREEZE was no factor.

Footnotes
DIZZY KITTY stalked the pace on the outside, edged ahead down the backstretch, shook clear into the second turn, then drew off in the stretch under mild
urging. STRATEGYFORYOU led in the early going, stayed on when challenged down the backstretch, angled out through the second turn to bid outside the
leader into the stretch, then was no threat to that one, while clearly best of the rest. HE'S A LUCKY GUY well placed and inside, saved ground through the
turns, angled three wide into the stretch, evened and held the show. DERBY CHILD mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through
inside of rivals into the stretch and closed for a share. MADDON allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide
into the stretch and improved his position. WHISKEY OR WINE passed tiring rivals. I'M THE CABANA BOY showed little. BE ON NOTICE mid pack, looped
three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in and faded.
