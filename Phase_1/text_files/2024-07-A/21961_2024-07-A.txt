Footnotes
RESIST THE DEVIL mid pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader three wide into the stretch, made a steady
gain, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then drifted out and drew off. THE CONNECTOR broke sharply from the gate and sprinted clear quickly, stayed on
when challenged into the stretch, then was no match late, while clearly best of the rest. CAPTAIN MAD JACK stalked the pace on the outside, lost some
position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, flattened the final furlong and held the show. CLEMSON TIGER unhurried, looped
three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, angled widest and got up for a share. CHARLIE CHARLIE mid pack, moved up on the
two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. OLDZFOURFORTYTWO well placed, held position two
and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. EXTRA MEDIUM unhurried, looped up three and four wide
through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and improved position. LEGIO passed tiring rivals. EXECUTIVE SIGHT mid pack, steadily lost ground.
INNUENDO was a brief factor, inside.
