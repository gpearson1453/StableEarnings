Footnotes
EXALTED JOY was put to right handed urging from the gate, settled three wide, dropped inside nearing the quarter pole, rallied along the rail to make the
lead in deep stretch and edged clear under strong handling. ORO DE MORO MORO rushed to the lead three wide on the clubhouse turn, set the pace until
mid stretch then couldn't handle the winner but finished gamely to gain second. APACHE pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, gained a narrow
advantage near the furlong marker then was outfinished. FRANCO failed to menace. MR LAOBAN moved up along the inside on the far turn then came up
empty. STREET MAX stalked the pace three wide into the stretch then weakened. SAY HEY KID was outrun. ROYAL AIR FORCE had speed from the start,
inched closer along the rail before a half, lacked room causing his rider to steady entering the far turn then dropped out of it. PER HISA RULING DATED
07/03/2024, EXALTED JOY WAS DQ'D FOR A WHIP VIOLATION.

SMOKIN' HOT chased the lead through the turn, responded under right handed urging to make the lead in the six path at the top of the stretch then finished
full of run under a brisk hand ride to win going away. JOKEMEISTER hopped at the start, rushed to the lead soon thereafter, set the pace into the stretch,
drifted to the five path then was no match for the winner while clear second best. MAKING ME CRAZY allowed to settle, found his best stride late four wide.
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT broke outward then failed to respond. AUGER stalked the early pace, moved closer along the rail into the stretch then came up empty.
SAHM TEQUILA trailed.

MO DONT NO allowed to settle, rallied three wide under left handed urging to engage the leader past the furlong marker and proved best in the final stages
by a narrow margin under right handed urging. VISUAL MISSION unhurried early, closed rapidly three wide through the far turn, made the lead in upper
stretch and just missed hanging on. SURROUNDER pressed the pace two wide for nearly a half, made the lead, set the pace into the stretch then was
outfinished. GIFT OF OAK was bumped by RAISE THE PURSES entering the first turn then failed to menace. RED HOT POWER well placed, lacked the
needed response. UNBRIDLED CAUSE was no threat. GOLD N SILVER away alertly, set the pace along the inside for nearly a half, had speed into the
stretch then stopped. RAISE THE PURSES checked bumping into GIFT OF OAK entering the clubhouse turn, dropped back and was never close.

Footnotes
LOFTHOUSE chased the early pace two wide, dropped inside on the turn, came on again along the rail under right handed urging to make the lead near
mid stretch and proved best under strong handling. BLUSHING BETTY chased the pace two wide into the stretch, drifted to the six path, drew on even
terms for the lead near the furlong marker then couldn't handle the winner. LADY LOTTIE chased the pace three wide into the stretch, was carried out to the
seven path and finished with good courage. TIZ INDEPENDENCE unhurried early, swung wide and closed a gap late in the middle of the racetrack.
PASSIONFORTREASURE allowed to settle, closed a gap along the inside in upper stretch then leveled off. LIONISTIC sprinted to a clear lead soon after
the start, set the pace while getting quick fractions into the stretch and weakened late. TWILIGHT VISION failed to menace. SHEWEARSMYRING trailed.
