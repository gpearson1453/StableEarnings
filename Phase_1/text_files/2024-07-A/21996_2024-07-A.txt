ASKMENOQUESTIONS broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch,
opened a clear advantage entering the final turn, and continued to widen his advantage through the lane while being ridden out late. DON W away alertly
and tracked the pacesetter one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished one out from the
rail in the drive to hold on for the place. BETTER TONE settled off the early pace while racing two wide entering the backstretch, launched his bid three wide
entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive to get up for a share. EXTRA INNINGS was unprepared at the start, and hopped as the gate
opened while scrambling to regain his footing and got away poorly, saved ground through the first turn while settling off the early pacesetter, continued to
save ground while commencing his bid entering the final turn, but was unable to overcome his troubled beginning while finishing at the rail in the drive.
CHAMPIOSA away well and stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide from between rivals entering
the final turn, but faded in the stretch drive. A stewards inquiry into the start of this race, resulted in no action being taken

Footnotes
ARIKARA away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of LUCY TREASURE entering the first turn, took control in the run to the final turn, held a
clear advantage into the lane, and was never seriously threatened late. ALOBRAH tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the
rail, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, shifted four wide after lacking room between rivals entering the lane, and closed willingly to get up for
the place. INDYETTA broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, launched her bid two wide entering the
final turn, and closed three wide in the drive and just missed the place. LUCY TREASURE hopped at the start, but recovered quickly and vied for the lead
from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside, was unable to match strides with the pacesetter in the run to
the final turn, and was outfinished in the stretch drive. QUALITY COMMAND away well, but was allowed to settle at the back of the field entering the
backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called
upon.

GO LENT GO broke sharply and stalked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, held a tracking trip two wide entering the
second turn, forced the issue two wide in the run to the final turn, rallied 2 wide through the final turn, assumed command from between rivals entering the
lane, and held HORATIO safely at bay late. HORATIO away alertly and stalked the leader into the stretch the first time while saving ground from along the
inside, maintained his position in the run down the backside, rallied three wide through the final turn, and closed willingly three out from the rail in the drive to
prove second best. MAX BOOSTER settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, saved ground through the
second turn to gain a striking position in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly from along the rail in the
drive to be along for a share. EVANDERKEEN unhurried early while trailing the field into the stretch the first time, began to gain ground in the run down the
backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed more late while finishing three wide in the drive. I'M SEEING RED away well, and rushed to
a clear lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace from along the rail through the second turn, battled from the inside of GO LENT GO
in the run to the final turn, fought gamely at the rail through the turn, but faded in the late stages. ATTAIN settled off the early pace while racing two out from
the rail through the stretch the first time, dropped back to trail in the run down the backside, and failed to mount a late bid when called upon.

SUNBLAZE broke sharply and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backside, launched her bid one
out from the rail entering the final turn, shifted three wide in mid stretch while splitting rivals, to grab the lead and quickly draw clear.
SAILINGFORTHESTARS away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside
and through the final turn, and gave way grudgingly late while holding on for the place. WEEKENDINDELMAR was off a step slow, but rushed up to gain a
tracking trip behind the dueling leaders entering the backstretch, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and closing willingly four wide in the
drive to get up for a share. NU BLEND away well and pressed the pace two wide from the outside of SAILINGFORTHESTARS entering the backstretch,
continued to force the pace two wide through the final turn and into the lane, and finished determinedly one out from the rail in the drive in a solid effort.
ANNIKA'S SONG unhurried early while dropping back to trail, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest three wide
in the drive. BABY I'M A STAR settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backside, continued to save ground entering the
final turn, but failed to respond when called upon.

Footnotes
LUCKY FORCE lagged well off the contested early pace while racing three wide entering the stretch the first time, bided his time well off the leaders in the
run down the backstretch, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed with a rush two out from the rail in the drive to get up in the final
strides. JUST JIMMY broke sharply and tracked the pacesetter into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in
the run down the backstretch, took control while racing two wide entering the final turn, and just failed to last. PAY MY WAY lagged well off the early pace
while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final
turn, and finished five wide in the drive to garner a share. COUNTERACT settled off the contested early pace while racing two wide through the stretch the
first time, held his position in the run down the backside and into the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. BUTTONWOOD
TREE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from the inside of JUST JIMMY through
the second turn and in the run down the backstretch, was unable to match strides with his pace rival entering the final turn, and weakened over the final
furlong.

WIRLY GIRLY broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, quickly overtook the pacesetters while launching
her bid three wide entering the final turn, and drew off in the lane while being kept to task to prove much the best. MINI MARKET stalked the dueling leaders
into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, and split rivals late one out from the rail nearing the
wire to get up for the place. LICORICE away well and dueled for the lead from the outside of HARTLEY MANOR entering the first turn, continued to force
the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch, was overtaken soon after entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to hold on for a
share. PETERSON LANDING stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid three wide entering the
final turn, and finished with some late interest three out from the rail in the drive. PERFECT PENNY settled at the back of the pack while saving ground at
the rail entering the first turn, launched her bid from along the inside entering the final turn, tipped four wide in mid stretch and finished with late interest.
HARTLEY MANOR away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and into
the final turn, was overhauled soon after entering the final turn, and was outfinished in the stretch drive. KARDINAL ROSE settled well off the early pace
while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, advanced three wide midway down the backstretch and into the final turn, but failed to sustain her
bid in the stretch drive.
