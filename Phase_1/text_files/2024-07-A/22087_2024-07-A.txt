Footnotes
DATTTS LIFE was squeezed back at the start, angled six wide at the three-eighths pole, rallied and was up in time under steady urging. CADILLAC
JUSTICE stalked the pace in the three path, bid at the quarter pole, was clear, came out at the sixteenth pole and was outfinished. GO FOREVER raced in
the two path, bid late along the rail but couldn't close. STAR REVIEW pressed the pace between the foes, rebroke late and was checked at the sixteenth
pole when a rival came out. INCLINED stalked the pace in the three path and steadied late. MYSTERY IMPACT stalked the pace in the five path and
offered a mild late bid. CAPTAIN'S BEST bore in at the start and saved ground. LOOKING GOOD LEWIS led inside and gave way at the three-sixteenth
pole, then steadied at the sixteenth pole. THEO'S PROMISE saved ground before fading. COWBOY IMAGE bid four wide at the three-eighths pole, gave
way in early stretch and was eased.
