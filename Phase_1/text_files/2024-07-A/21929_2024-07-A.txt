Footnotes
JOVIE G sprinted to the lead from the inside to the top of the stretch where she was headed but dug in and came again for a determined win. CHARLIE'S
GAL stalked the pace down the backstretch then made a three wide bid at the half mile marker and engaged the leader near the top of the stretch to take a
brief lead but was denied and was second best. RADIANT REBEL was allowed to settle around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack down the
backstretch and made a rail bid on the final turn but had to shift out to two wide at the eighth pole and closed well. MRS. MACOMBER saved ground
throughout while racing in the middle of the pack, made a rail bid in the stretch and missed the show. ADAMANTLY broke well and went four wide into the
first turn then settled in the middle of the pack while racing three wide, made a late run in the stretch to improve position. TAKE IT TO COURT raced in the
middle of the pack from three or four wide then made a late four wide bid in the stretch but was too late. REINA'S VISION tracked the leaders from the
inside, made a middle move on the backstretch but faltered. RONA VISION was unhurried down the backstretch, made a three wide bid at the eighth pole to
pass tiring rivals. LA CANTAROS raced off the pace from two wide through the final turn and dropped back. HONEY PAT vied from the lead from three wide
on the first turn then settled off the pace on the backstretch and retreated. OUR INDIAN GIRL was void of speed and never menaced.

Footnotes
LAYLA'S SONG raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then moved between horses going into the final turn, tipped out to three wide in upper
stretch to run down the leader and drew clear. PETULA tracked the leader through the final turn then showed the late kick but was outfinished by outside
rival in deep stretch. JUNIORS JOANIE sprinted to a unchallenged lead to the top of the stretch and was collared in the final furlong and tired. MY MY was
unhurried to the top of the stretch the made a two wide late bid to improve position. ELMO'S SECRET stalked the pace from two wide to the half mile
marker and dropped back. SWIZZLECITY was allowed to settle near the back but failed to menace. FOREIGN TOURIST raced off the pace while saving
ground to the top of the stretch then gave way. DEROUTANTE broke through the starting gate prior to the start then raced near the back from three wide
and was never a threat.

Footnotes
JUBILANT JOANIE stalked the pace from four wided down the backstretch then moved in to three wide around the turn while moving up, drove past the
leader in the final yards and drew clear in the final jumps. MISS PRIORITY prompted the pace down the backstretch the moved up to engage the leader
midway through the turn and took the lead near the three sixteenths pole but was collared in the final yards but kept on to be second best. MUSIC
MISTRESS trailed the field early then made a three wide bid at the three furlong marker, tipping out to four wide in upper stretch for a late bid but was no
match for the top two. FABS saved ground while racing near the back then made a late two wide stretch bid to improve position. YOLANDA WHO was
hustled along to take an inside position to press the pace to the turn then faded on the turn and finished evenly. DON'TCALLMEPATSY rushed to the
pressured lead to the turn then was headed midway through the turn and gave way in the stretch. TENACIOUS LADY was always back.

Footnotes
SUMMERTIME BANDIT was slightly restless in the gate then went to an unchallenged lead through out and was kept to task in the stretch drive to prove
best. BACK STREET BABY raced off the pace around the first turn then made a middle move on the backstretch, moved up the rail around the final turn
and tipped out to two wide at the eighth pole but was no match for the winner. PAT HAND GIRL was allowed to settle near the back down the backstretch
then made a two wide bid on the final turn and angled in at the eighth pole to rally for the show. SMART IZZY was unsettled in the gate then tracked the
leaders from the inside down the backstretch, slipped through going into the final turn, angled out to two wide at the quarter pole but was outfinished in late
stretch. MIDNIGHT TRIP saved ground while racing in the middle of the pack around the first turn then raced from the two path down the backstretch, made
a three wide mild bid on the final turn for a mild rally but was never a serious threat. HOT PATOOTIE raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground
but failed to menace. STARSNMOTION was slightly restless in the starting gate then was allowed to settle near the back down the backstretch, made a mild
bid on the final turn but was not a factor. SUPER ET was last away and trailed the field down the backstretch and passed tired ones. DADDY HEY DADDY
stalked the pace from three wide to midway through the final turn and tired. EVERYLITTLESINGH prompted the pace from two wide to midway through the
final turn and gave way.

Footnotes
NAVAGATIONALBEACON vied for the lead from three wide then moved up to match strides outside of BE BO to the top of the stretch and drew clear. BE
BO went to the front to a pressured lead and matched strides inside of NAVAGATIONALBEACON to the top of the stretch and weakened. SCRAPBOOK
stalked the pace from four wide to the turn then tipped in to be three wide around the turn but couldn't catch the top two and was a game third. BE A
BANDIT chased the leaders going four wide on the turn but never made a serious bid. OOCHIE pressed the pace from two wide to the half mile marker and
faded. MARDI GRAS ALARM looked to jump a shadow early then trailed the field, was pulled up near the half mile marker and given a ride on the equine
ambulance.
