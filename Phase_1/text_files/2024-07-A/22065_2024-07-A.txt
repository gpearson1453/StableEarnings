Footnotes
KEEN CAT settled along the inside around the first turn, tracked the pace up the backstretch, angled out and loomed boldly mid-way around the far turn,
vied with SHOTSHELL into the stretch, shook free near the final sixteenth and edged away. SHOTSHELL sped to the lead at the start and set the pace up
the backstretch, got headed by KEEN CAT mid-way around the far turn, fought back gamely from the inside, dueled for the lead into the final furlong then
gave way grudgingly. CYBERTOWN raced three paths wide into the first turn, stalked the pace up the backstretch, edged a bit closer entering the far turn,
hustled along three wide into upper stretch, angled in, kept on and cleared the rest. KEEN HEIR was reserved racing in the back, hustled along three to four
wide into upper stretch and had no response. DAVIDIC LINE was forwardly placed around the first turn and up the backstretch then came up empty late on
the final turn.

Footnotes
SORCERER'S GIRL tracked the top pair three wide in early stages, let out a notch and moved up to challenge SONG OF PRAISE at the quarter pole, held
a slim lead at the head of the lane, widened advantage under firm handling and finished going away. UNGLUED raced off the early pace, hustled along four
wide into upper stretch, finished with good response and secured second best. SKYLAR'S FIRE raced off the early pace, was ridden along three wide
around the turn, kept on three to four wide into upper stretch and gained a share. NAUTICAL MISS tracked the early pace along the inside, saved ground
around the turn, angled out entering upper stretch, hustled along two to three wide and got edged late for show. SONG OF PRAISE vied for the lead in
opening stages, shook clear near the half mile marker, got collared by the eventual winner late on the turn, fought back along the inside then weakened in
the final furlong. BIT A BAD NEWS was reserved racing in the back, swung five wide into upper stretch and needed more for impact. CATALE vied for the
lead to the half mile marker, chased in close contention around the turn, ran on to mid-stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
BARBERSHOP raced in range off the embattled top flight, had to wait for racing room along the rail around the turn, continued to lack a clear path upper
stretch, angled three then two wide, kicked in gamely and got up in time. LIBERTY'S HAULER vied four deep for the early lead, edged back just a bit
entering the turn and sat three wide in aim at the quarter pole, given turning for home, held clear going by the furlong marker, continued to battle on then got
caught in final strides. ROSIE'S BOY vied two wide between rivals for the early lead, weakened into the second flight mid-way around the turn, launched a
rebid four then three wide in upper stretch and secured a share. BRILLIANT COLORS vied for the early lead racing three wide between foes, battled on with
SARAHS BLUE BOY around the turn, got collared in upper stretch then flattened in the final furlong. OBVIOUSLY TOO raced in the back in early stages,
edged up and raced three wide in range around the turn, shifted wider for the drive and failed to kick on. MOJITO raced in the second flight late on the
backstretch, hustled up four wide late on the turn then gave way in the lane. SARAH'S BOY BLUE vied inside of rivals through early stages, battled on
around the turn then tired in the drive. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SCOOT ALONG tracked the pace in opening stages then made a three wide move around the turn, took over the lead at the head of the lane, continued on
top under pressure and held in final strides. AMERICAN SUE sat back off the pace in early stages, saved ground around the turn, angled three wide at the
head of the lane, edged closer, split foes near the furlong marker then shifted in, surged and just missed. SUPER EMPIRE raced in range in the early going,
chased two wide around the turn,, shifted wider for the drive, sustained a steady bid and cleared a share. SNUGGLE BUNNY raced two to three wide off the
early leaders, hustled up along the outside late on the turn, came five paths wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. WUMPMUG was forwardly
placed racing behind the pacesetter, chased along the inside around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, ran on to the eighth pole then came up
empty. GANGSTER AMERICANO took over the lead soon after the start, set the pace and continued on top around the turn, got collared at the head of the
lane and retreated.

Footnotes
GONZAGA BAY briefly vied for the early lead then shook free and held firm along the inside around the turn, continued on top into upper stretch, responded
willingly under right handed pressure and pulled away. LAZARUS vied briefly for the early lead then tracked rival into the turn, saved ground along the inside
entering the lane, tipped two wide in upper stretch, ran on and secured second best. WICKED PRINCE raced in range just off the top trio in early stages,
was ridden along three wide around the turn, sustained bid through the lane and held a share. KINFOLK raced off the early pace saving ground, swung four
wide into upper stretch, ran on and improved position. LUCKY'S SECRET raced near midpack along the inside, came two wide into upper stretch and
lacked a needed rally. EZ FITZ chased two wide off the top flight late on the backstretch, urged along the inside in the lane and failed to threaten. SCOTT
CITY was forwardly placed, chased in contention around the turn then weakened in the final furlong. ROMAN GENERAL raced off the pace, came two wide
into the lane and had no response. VYING EDGE raced in or near the back, came four wide into upper stretch and had no response.

Footnotes
DRILL'S LI'L MAN vied for the early lead between rivals then battled on racing inside of BRAHMS IMAGE around the turn, shook free turning for home,
quickly widened to a clear advantage and was ridden out in the final sixteenth. COLONEL KLINK tracked the pace up the backstretch, moved up in striking
range three wide at the quarter pole, sustained two wide bid for DRILLS LIL MAN through the lane but was no match and had to settle for second best.
HIDE THE DEMON vied for the lead in the opening quarter, kept close along the inside around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, weakened off the
top pair but finisihed clear for a share. GRAND DESIGN raced off the top trio, failed to kick on when called upon in the turn, drifted out turning for home and
gave way. BRAHMS IMAGE broke sharp from the outside, led the way then quickly took on the challenge of a pair of rivals, dueled three wide, continued to
battle with the eventual winner around the turn then tired in the drive. TUFF WILLY TE raced off the pace, saved ground and failed to move into contention.
BIG SWEDE was taken to the far outside and eased up soon after the start, continuously dropped back while not being persevered with and jogged in.
