Footnotes
BAILESTON LASSIE was hustled to a clear early lead, allowed to relax after the first eighth, roused again leaving the bend, floated out entering the lane,
drifted out under left-handed pressure midstretch, gradually floated out in the late going but held sway under steady handling. I LUV THIS BAR raced in the
second flight from outside, moved clear for second from path three on the turn, drifted out some into the stretch, gradually angled out as BAILESTON
LASSIE came out and lacked the needed late kick. ORNERY ANGEL soon trailed, lost ground widest through the bend, rallied belatedly in the stretch but
caught NEXT TIME YOU WIN for third in the waning yards. NEXT TIME YOU WIN advanced three wide on the turn, fanned out behind I LUV THIS BAR for
the drive and finished evenly. ABBMAR boxed in early, progressed along the rail on the turn but leveled off for the stretch run. WITCHING was prominent
between rivals on the backstretch but faded two wide on the bend.

Footnotes
SKIP THE FORMALITY rated from outside, was let out on the bend, floated out to path six for the stretch run, drew clear inside the last eighth and was
clearly the best. WILDWOOD DOROTHY prominent between horses, was two then three wide taking the turn, edged ahead for the lead from between rivals
upper stretch, was no match for SKIP THE FORMALITY inside the final furlong but stayed clear for second. CLASSY ACTION fractious in the gate, was
without early speed, advanced three wide on the turn, fanned out some for the drive, angled in midstretch, altered back out for a clear path in the late going
and edged ahead for third in time. REDHEADEDSTRANGER set a pressured pace from outside on the backstretch, moved clear after two furlongs, stayed
off the rail taking the bend, drifted out to path five for the stretch run and began to flatten out between rivals. RICKY'S PART broke inward, bumping
WILDWOOD ADIOS, was well placed inside, steadied when her path was taken into the turn, dropped back while staying along the rail through the turn then
showed late interest from inside in the lane. WILDWOOD ADIOS reluctant to load, overcame a bump at the break to vie for the early lead from just off the
inside, did not stay with REDHEADEDSTRANGER after a quarter mile, took the rail into the bend, floated out some for the stretch run, came again to vie for
the lead upper stretch but flattened out inside the last eighth. DERBY DAY GOLD soon trailed from well off the inside, angled to the rail into the turn, fanned
out some for the stretch run but had little to offer.

TOO MUCH TUESDAY rated off the early speed, moved to the outside midway on the backstretch, made a swift move three wide to draw clear on the bend
then maintained control under steady handling the last eighth. VASARIAH'S IMAGE moved to the outside after two furlongs, also made her bid outside
rivals on the turn to take over second, lacked the extra needed in the lane, lugged in deep stretch but proved clearly second best. PRIMITY prominent just
off the rail, squeezed through two wide with a quarter mile left, drew off for third upper stretch but was no match for the top pair in the late going. SLEEPY
CAT displayed early speed from inside, was overtaken on the turn then gave way along the rail the final quarter mile. GABRIELLA ATTACK disputed the
pace from outside but began to fade three wide with two furlongs to go. FERGIE ATTACK unruly in the gate, was away somewhat slowly and showed little.

PADDY GAL lugged in some just after the break to bump BLAZE BEAUTY, moved clear of the rest into the first turn, showed the way in hand just off the
rail, challenged from outside nearing the end of six furlongs, was roused at the quarter pole, drew clear upper stretch and held on under steady urging.
BLAZE BEAUTY bobbled slightly at the start then was crowded briefly, stayed close just outside PADDY GAL, went for the lead on the second turn, drifted
out some entering the lane, lacked the extra needed deep stretch but held off MISS TENA MARIE for the place. MISS TENA MARIE broke well then was
settled back, steadily progressed from outside on the backstretch, took over third three wide on the second turn, lost some ground staying outside BLAZE
BEAUTY into the stretch, rallied belatedly but was easily best of the rest. HER NAME WAS LOLA raced in contention just outside BLAZE BEAUTY in the
early going, was two wide on the second bend, swung out some for the drive and gave way. SCRAPPY PATCH chased from inside, angled out through the
second turn then could only make up minor ground deep stretch. MISS KITTY PIE was forwardly placed along the rail on the backstretch and second bend
but gave way just off the rail through the lane.

Footnotes
FIVE STAR RUN rated off the early speed, took over two wide when allowed on the turn, drifted out some entering the lane, gradually drifted out under
left-handed pressure the final furlong but held on. GONE AGAIN jostled briefly with ZOOMA leaving the chute, progressed just off the rail, gradually angled
out taking the bend, rallied belatedly outside FIVE STAR RUN the last eighth but was easily best of the others. DOUBLE DRIBBLE in contention early, did
not stay close while widest through the turn, moved clear for third upper stretch then could only just hold his position late. GUN IT AND RUN IT prominent
from inside, retreated after a quarter mile, fanned out to path three for the stretch run, began to close the gap inside the final furlong but bore out the last
seventy yards. KNUCKLE void of speed, angled in into the bend, moved to the outside at the top of the stretch, failed to have a significant response and
was steadied behind GUN IT AND RUN IT in the waning yards. MY SECRET moved clear after the first furlong, was overtaken from outside on the turn and
steadily gave way along the rail the final quarter mile. ZOOMA was eased on the turn, pulled up in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
WESLAN prominent from the early going, was three then four wide taking the bend, edged ahead upper stretch and shook free with seventy yards to go.
MOVE IN SILENCE somewhat fractious in the gate, chased in midpack between rivals, altered out abruptly five wide upper stretch, rallied belatedly but
caught RUN THE TABLE for second near the wire. RUN THE TABLE vied for the lead from inside, moved clear on the turn, came off the rail some entering
the lane, could not hold back WESTAN and lugged in to the rail with a sixteenth left. GRAYHOP bore inward at the start, was steadied, gradually progressed
along the rail, came into contention inside the final furlong, lost his path to RUN THE TABLE with a sixteenth left and altered out three wide. SPAN soon
trailed, was just off the rail on the bend, lost considerable ground fanning out to the middle of the track for the drive and passed tired ones deep stretch.
HE'S A FINE MAN in midpack early toward the outside, reached contention four wide on the turn, came into the stretch outside WESLAN, altered out briefly
when MOVE IN SILENCE came close approaching the furlong marker and steadily yielded. RED MOSCATO chased from well off the inside and was never
a factor. LATE BLACKSMITH disputed the pace outside RUN THE TABLE on the backstretch but began to fade before finishing a half mile.

C F V BULLET rated off the early speed, went for the lead two wide on the second bend, moved clear, was challenged from outside after entering the final
furlong, gradually drifted out under left-handed pressure but held sway. BILL'S HONOR prominent just off the inside, angled outside C F V BULLET on the
second turn, engaged the latter inside the last eighth, gradually angled out to stay clear of C F V BULLET deep stretch, lacked the needed late kick but
pulled away for the place. PAYNT BY LETTERS moved clear and took the inside on the first bend, was overtaken on the second turn, slowly yielded along
the rail in the stretch but was clearly best of the others. IRISH DECLARATION broke a bit outward, was steadied, moved out widest midway on the

ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS dropped back to midpack while four wide on the backstretch, stayed in that path and had no late bid. AVIANO hesitated at the
start, chased from inside, did not respond to urging in the stretch and was in hand through the waning yards. MAPACHE G also hesitated at the break,
raced just outside AVIANO for six furlongs then faded away.

Footnotes
HOT DAME well placed inside, came off the rail for a clear path midway on the backstretch, was three then four wide taking the bend, rallied to gain the lead
inside the last eighth and drew off the final sixteenth. STYLE without early speed, picked up her pace while saving ground through the turn, altered out six
wide upper stretch, made a strong move the final furlong, was too late but caught MAMBA OUT for second. MAMBA OUT soon had a clear lead and the
inside, was kept in hand and overtaken on the bend, roused leaving the turn, moved clear upper stretch, was no match for HOT DAME deep stretch, began
to wear down in the waning yards and was outfinished for the place. THINK BLUE was a step slow at the break, rushed up contention while just off or along
the rail, fanned out behind HOT DAME entering the lane, altered outside the latter upper stretch and finished evenly. BEIRUT BEAUTY was bumped and
shuffled back shortly after the start, advanced from outside to gain a clear lead midway on the bend, came into the stretch from path three, was overtaken
from inside and gradually yielded between rivals the final eighth. DOROTA chased from off the inside, saved ground taking the turn and failed to have a
significant stretch response. NOT TO BE DENIED bumped with BEIRUT BEAUTY shortly after the break, was an early contender between rivals but faded
four wide on the turn. DELTA LADY fractious in the gate, soon faded from between horses and showed little.
