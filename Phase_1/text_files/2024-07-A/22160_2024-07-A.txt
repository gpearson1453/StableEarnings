Footnotes
SAMMY STONE watched the loose leader on the first turn, began to reel in the frontrunner at the half, battled outside around the final bend, had a slim lead
in mid-stretch and determinedly fended off the outside closer late to prevail for the win. FABELMAN travelled in the third flight outside foes down the
backstretch, moved in smartly around horses at the quarter pole, gathered more momentum when swinging out to the four path turning for home, fought on
to the wire but was denied in deep stretch. SILVER SMOKE was alone up front into the first turn, was headed outside at the half while slowing the pace
down the backside, dueled on the fence throughout the far turn, tried to stay involved inside down the lane but faded in deep stretch to be a clear third in the
end. KILLARY trailed the field while on the rail in the early stages, began to pass foes on the inside, commencing the run at the three furlong pole, took
closer order, shifting out to be three wide two furlongs from home, angled to be five wide for the drive and finished with energy to get up for a minor role.
KINGSCOTE stalked in the third flight in the beginning, was ahead of only one rival down the backstretch, was roused at the three eighths marker but could
not make any impact on the turn, swung out widest in the six path straightening out for home, was gaining on the leaders late but could not be involved at
the finish line. SEATTLE DOWN UNDER improved down the backstretch to be in the second flight, tracking on the rail by the half, was nudged for more run
on the fence at the quarter pole keeping pace with the leaders, had a chance when in range just behind the contesting lead duo in upper stretch but
flattened out at the sixteenth pole. PHANTOM JEWEL hopped then hit the inside of the gate at the start, settled on the rail in the third flight in the first turn,
rated kindly, galloping along the backside to keep close tabs on the top two at the half, was hard ridden outside at the three eighths marker, could not
quicken with rivals when in-between at the quarter pole and retreated in the two path with runners on both sides at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
NORTHERN RUBY was content to track four wide outside the lead trio down the backstretch, cruised around horses comfortably closing in around the
bend, loomed the main threat in the five path turning for home and edged away for the win in deep stretch. CLEOMENES settled on the rail in midfield down
the backside, waited for the cue to move nestled on the fence around the bend, had a clear lane inside turning for home, bid for the lead at the furlong pole
but was outkicked by the winner late. HARD TO CAPTURE prompted the pace three wide between early, tracked three deep by the half, was asked three
wide at the quarter pole with the eventual winner on her outside and willingly fought to the wire but was no match for the top two late. SILENT GUROO
broke out on the start, opened up on the field by the half, was headed with rivals on both sides while clinging onto the lead at the eighth pole, could not find
more late and yielded in the final sixteenth for a minor role. AIRY FAIRY was unhurried to see the field down the backstraight, could not get enthused
around the bend and finished with good intent angling inside at the furlong marker to pass some rivals to the finish line. LOIS LEN pressed the issue two
wide in the beginning, tracked the pacesetter between foes at the half, was nudged to go on with rivals on both sides at the quarter pole, could not keep up
with the leader and wilted between foes at the furlong marker. TRIZZEL TRAZZEL settled between rivals in the two path in mid-division down the backside,
was urged at the three furlong pole, could not make any headway throughout the turn and made little presence in the five path in the stretch running.
BLAZING SKY was brushed on the start, settled three deep outside rivals in mid-pack, was asked for more run three eighths out, offered little response on
the turn, swung out widest in the six path for the drive but failed to fire down the lane. GABBY SQUARED travelled on the rail ahead of one foe along the
backside, made a brief move on the rail in midturn, was steadied sharply on the fence when in tight at the furlong marker and could not recover to pose a
threat.

Footnotes
POPPY'S JOY travelled on the rail in midfield in the first turn, improved entering the backside to track the lead trio while nested on the fence, quickly moved
in on the rail at the three furlong marker, shifted outside to bid for the lead at the quarter pole and had another gear with a furlong left to run to repel the late
charge and secure the win. SACCHARINE was allowed to settle at the back, trailed for the first part of the route race, began to commence a run, passing
rivals three wide on the outside at the seven sixteenths marker, continued to circle around horses three wide on the far turn, loomed a menacing presence
outside, five wide at the top of the stretch, could not sustain the run and easily bested the rest for second money. SHAKSHUKA was away alertly to clear to
the rail for the lead entering the first turn, kept on going up front unchallenged down the backside, was collared outside by the winner at the quarter pole,
offered no resistance but did stay on stubbornly to be a clear third at the wire. PRINCESS JADE had a stalking trip in the rail in the third tier down the
backside, started to rally going by rivals at the five sixteenths marker but was one paced in the lane to settle on the fringes in the end. QUEST TO BE
PROUD stalked outside a rival in the third flight down the back straight, had no run to give by the three eighths pole, seeing the field on the far turn, slipped
up the fence to pass tired horses by the quarter pole but could not get involved in the stretch drive. MCKENZIE ROAD shifted outside from the rail entering
the first turn, tracked between rivals down the backside, was urged to go on with foes on either side three furlongs out, had no response and backed away
through the turn. SPELLCHECK broke out, was taken a hold off after the start to trail early, took closer order going around rivals five wide on the first turn,
tracked the pacesetter three deep on the outside down the backstretch, was asked for more run three furlongs to go, was empty, stopped around the final
turn and was not persevered with to the wire.

Footnotes
VAZHI pressed the pace from outside from the outset racing two to three wide, willingly took over outside the quarter pole, was put to moderate urging at
that point and responded to quickly move clear by the top of the stretch, held sway under just mild hand urging while ridden out. ROIKOP was forced inward
at the start exchanging a few bumps with a rival, settled off the pace three to four wide and outside runners, advanced four to five deep on the far turn, was
no match for the winner but secured the place. QUALITY PRESENCE broke inwardly bumping a rival then was bumped by the outside foe, settled about
mid-pack stalking four deep, was put to urging by the quarter pole still about four wide, kept on evenly in the stretch to get the nod for show. LEMON
SWEETS went straight to the front setting the tempo while shadowed by the eventual winner and racing inside on or just off the rail, was overtaken by the
quarter pole, lacked the needed late kick but fought on gamely for show honors despite losing the nod. IN AWE was caught five wide heading into the first
turn then eased back and shifted in a bit but still racing well off the inside and at the rear, went four to five wide mostly through the far turn, a bit wider for the
drive, passed tired rivals. NANTUCKETS DAY was well-placed two to three wide between mid-pack and not too far off the leaders but was one-paced and
failed to rally. DESIGN DIVA forced a rival in at the start, took back and angled in to the rail entering the first turn settling at the back, swung nine wide
turning for home and passed tired rivals but was never a threat. HELIOCENTRIC was up close tracking inside, ridden along by the five-sixteenths, faded
soon after. BEYOND OSCAR was bumped at the start, raced off the pace mostly two to three wide between runners and was never near enough to
threaten. ALL FOR HONOR broke a bit awkwardly, angled to the rail, saved ground, was not a factor.

Footnotes
CRYSTAL VISIONS was reined back off the early pace, tracked contently on the rail watching the lead pair down the backside and throughout the turn,
pounced when asked at the quarter pole, shifted outside, three wide at the top of the lane, was encouraged left handed in upper stretch and drew away
convincingly under a vigorous ride to the finish line. MCGILL stalked four deep outside foes near the rear in the beginning, started to smartly pick up runners
three wide on the outside at the three furlong pole, continued to steadily go by rivals through the turn, angled out six wide straightening out in the lane,
continued the long sustained rally and held for the place share at the wire. SKYLIGHT CAPER travelled in mid-division early, was shuffled back a touch at
the half, was roused at the quarter pole outside only ahead of one rival, angled out in the seven path at the top of the lane, was full of run moving very
strong in deep stretch and closed in to capture the show award. MISS DEMANDING travelled on the fence in midfield down the backside, stalked in the third
flight keeping pace inside around the bend, was in range for a share of the prize in upper stretch on the fence and finished up willingly for a minor role.
SAPPHIRE CONNECT tracked the front pair outside down the back straight, moved in, closing the gap on the leaders while in hand through the turn, posed
a threat five wide at the top of the stretch but could not find more and levelled off in the last seventy yards. XARABELLA broke in at the start, co-trailed on
the inside down the backstretch, took the short way around the turn, inching up on the fence, shifted out to the four path straightening out for home, dove
back in to the rail by mid-stretch and finished up evenly to the wire. JUST LIKE THAT spurted away for the lead at the start, set the pace with only mild
pressure applied by an outside challenger down the backside, kept travelling comfortably up front throughout the turn, put away the pace foe by the quarter
pole, had little left for the drive though and weakened in the final seventy yards. BRIGHT SUNSHINE was off a step slow to begin, co-trailed on the outside
in the backstretch, was alone in last by the half, started to go past runners three wide at the five sixteenths pole, angled out widest in the eight path turning
for home and passed some rivals in mid-stretch. OUTFORARIP travelled in mid-pack outside foes at the half, settled in the third flight still outside horses
around the bend, was roused midturn, had little to offer and retreated in upper stretch. CREVALLE ROYALE stalked inside a foes in the three path near the
rear in the beginning, had to be geared down briefly when stuck behind a weakening rival at the seven sixteenths marker, losing her momentum, showed no
interest saving ground through the turn to trail by the quarter pole and could not get into contention on the fence down the stretch. FANNY M prompted the
pace outside down the back straight, could only put mild pressure when chasing the frontrunner around the bend, had nothing left to give for the drive and
folded in the four path at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
ECSTASY settled outside a runner mid-pack mostly three wide, advanced on the far turn angling five wide coming past the quarter pole, rallied in the stretch
to take over a furlong out, spurted clear at that point while lugging in and had sufficient advantage to hold safe. DESTINY RO tucked in two to three wide
heading into the first turn settling toward the back outside a rival, moved out and began to pick it up three to four wide on the far turn, angled out in upper
stretch, kicked on well to secure the place while no threat to the winner. CRY FREEDOM unhurriedly brought up the rear racing off the inside, swung seven
wide turning for home, gained late. BOLT ENOREE tucked in from four to three wide on the first turn just off the leaders and stalking outside, continued
three to four deep on the far turn, made a mild bid nearing the eighth pole but had no extra. PEGGY broke a bit awkwardly, settled at the back saving
ground inside, continued to bide time along the rail, came out four to five wide in the drive and kept on late but needed more. EMERANCE stalked early, put
the pressure on two to three wide on the far turn taking a narrow and brief lead about the three-sixteenths, was engulfed by the eighth pole and lacked the
needed late kick. OUR FLAG FLYING was taken back a bit in the early going racing in behind in the back off the field near mid-pack saving ground through
the first turn, moved out heading to the far turn, swung out a bit further for the drive, failed to make a late bid. PRINCESS MAYFAIR quickly moved clear, set
the pace inside on or just off the rail, faded in the stretch. AWASEF was a bit keen pulling against the rider's restraint early, shifted in and settled down in
behind the leaders tracking while saving ground, was ridden along by the seven-sixteenths but had no response and came up empty.

Footnotes
ELYSIAN FIELD broke outwards to begin, tracked the frontrunner three deep outside of rivals down the backside, cruised around horses to bid three wide at
the quarter pole, fought on relentlessly down the stretch, wore down the two inside rivals late and got the nod right at the finish line for the score. SPANSIVE
took command from the start, comfortably dictated the pace alone up top through the backstretch, was collared outside by runners at the quarter pole, dug
in stubbornly on the fence fending off the rivals at the furlong marker, drifted out when urged left-handed in deep stretch and was caught right at the wire by
the surging winner. WICKENHEISER was close to the back of the pack on the rail in a stalking position, improved down the backstretch, closed in going
between horses at the two furlong marker, shifted out to the four path for the drive and had a very good late burst to be involved for the win photo at the
wire. BLUEBERRY FIELDS watched the pacesetter into the first turn, tracked the leaders with horses on either side along the backstretch, moved in with the
eventual winner on her outside at the quarter pole, dueled between foes down the stretch, was steadied at the seventy yards pole and settled on the fringes
in the end. INDY CHAMPAGNE stalked near the rear outside horses, trailed the field by the half, was scrubbed on for more two wide outside at the quarter
pole and in the three path, passed tired runners on both sides through the stretch. COMANCHE COUNTRY (IRE) was on the rail in midfield going into the
first turn, had a good spot being part of the tracking trio while on the rail down the backstretch, could not keep up on the fence with the top three foes when
the pace quickened at the quarter pole and weakened in the last sixteenth. MYRISKYAFFAIR was situated on the outside three wide in mid-pack to begin,
made little headway along the backside, offered a brief run three wide outside foes midway on the final turn but stalled outside in upper stretch. TALBEYAH
(IRE) was checked on the start, was allowed to gather herself, trailing on the rail in the early going, started to mount a run, going by a rival on the fence at
three eighths marker when the field bunched up, could not make any more progress through the turn and lacked a finishing rally on the rail in the stretch.
PER RULING #2752828 FROM THE ALCOHOL AND GAMING COMMISSION OF ONTARIO, COMANCHE COUNTRY (IRE) WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM
6th TO UNPLACED DUE OT BEING INELIGIBLE.

Footnotes
BULLET settled in stalking mid-division outside, advanced willingly and in hand about four wide late on the turn swiftly taking charge by the three-sixteenths,
was asked nearing the furlong grounds and readily responded to draw clear and was given just some reminders through the lane to win impressively.
SOUPERGIRL settled inside off the pace, switched out on the turn, moved five wide coming near the quarter pole, was no match for the winner but secured
the place late. CARLISLE BAY broke sharply, attended the pace from outside, was carried out a bit by inside rivals early on the turn racing about four to five
wide into that bend, took command and swiftly shot clear past the three-eighths and shifted in a bit at this stage, was challenged by the eventual winner at
the top of the stretch and put to stout urging at that juncture, was no match for that one but held show honors. AMBITIOUS LASS veered outwardly at the
start, angled in early settling at the rear near the inside, fanned eight wide turning for home, kept on widest of all but needed more. OBLIGING exchanged a
light bump at the start, moved forward between foes to contest the pace between, raced mostly two to four wide throughout, dropped back off the leader
from the three-eighths, ran on evenly in the stretch. BOUND TO BE TRUE exchanged a light bump at the start, was up close amongst the early leaders
before being taken back off a trio nearing the half, stalked in behind about three wide on the turn, checked just about at the five-sixteenths, kept on in the
stretch but was left with too much to do. WILLOW OAK was in tight and shuffled back not too long after the start, raced outside a foe at the rear, was carried
seven wide into upper stretch by that one and ran on without threatening. LITHICA contested the pace inside, appeared to be getting out early on the turn,
steadied past the three-eighths pole rapidly dropping back off the lead, continued to weaken thereafter. YOU NEED ME was mid-pack early, ridden along
nearing the three-eighths but had no response and rapidly dropped back to last.

Footnotes
PLEASURE'S GOLD settled inside a rival in the third flight having a stalking role in the beginning, burst between horses, starting her rally midway on the
turn, closed the gap in the four path at the top of the lane, found her best stride late and got up in deep stretch for the well timed late rally. TALK TO YA
LATER veered out sharply on the break, shifted in quickly to the rail soon afterwards, co-trailed on the outside coming up to the half mile marker, waited
behind the field through the turn, began to pass foes on the rail five sixteenths from home, shifted outside at the quarter pole, angled out some more to have
clear run in the five path straightening out for the drive and closed in sharply to make it a race in deep stretch. LANTANA LADY tracked the engaged duo
while travelling on the fence down the backside, began to reel in the embattled leaders around the turn, assumed command between foes at the sixteenth
pole but was caught by the late closers in deep stretch and settled for the show money. VERI GIZMO was checked on the rail entering the backstretch,
co-trailed on the inside nearing the half, made a good rail move for position entering the turn, was in the hunt for a share in the two path behind the leaders
in upper stretch, finished up well when getting room and settled on the fringes in the end. INDIAN MUSIC forced the pace inside along the backside, dueled
stubbornly on the rail around the bend, had no more to give on the fence in the stretch, faded by the furlong marker but did pass the rival that was battling in
the early stages with her right at the wire. FOOLISH GAMES had the lead outside while pressed by a foe on the rail, continued to battle outside throughout
the turn, put away the tenacious pace rival in mid-stretch, had little left in the tank latte and was engulfed by outside horses seventy yards from the finish
line. TAQUANYAH settled on the outside in the third flight stalking, was scrubbed on three wide at the three eighths marker, had little to offer around the
bend and could not be a factor in the stretch running. SACRED DANCER tracked the contesting pair on the outside down the back straight, was going the
wrong three wide outside rivals in midturn and emptied out by upper stretch.

Footnotes
BLACKDIAMOND DINNY took control on the rail right from the start, was moving comfortably loose on the lead down the back straight, had no challengers
in sight around the far turn and coasted home for the front end score. EMPIRE'S TREAT tracked the pacesetter on the fence in the first turn, continued in
the second flight on the rail down the backside watching the leader, could not close in on the winner by the far turn, dueled inside for the place share in
upper stretch and easily bested others for the runners up share in a spread out field. WILD QUEENIE was allowed to settle on the rail near the back in the
first turn, improved inside to be in the third flight on the rail down the backside, shifted out at the quarter pole commencing a run and started to reach for
more ground in the four path between rivals down the lane and came out the winner in the three way duel for third place. INDIANA ROAD trailed the field
down the backstretch, was let out a notch, making a quick move around horses three wide with three furlongs to go, continued to keep on coming outside
foes through the far turn, shifted out to the five path for the drive but lost the battle for third money. FRAC AMOUR tracked two wide on the first turn, sat
outside a rival while trying to keep up to the frontrunner along the backside, battled outside for the place share in the far turn, stared to fade when in the
three path by the furlong marker and lost holding on for a minor share in deep stretch to closing in outside runners. PENNYJET broke out at the start,
travelled four wide between horses on the first of two turns, was three deep outside rivals down the back straight in the third flight stalking, came under a
ride throughout the far turn but could not mount a rally. MARDENE hopped at the break, travelled widest, outside foes in the five path into the first turn, was
four deep on the outside near the rear down the backstretch, made a brief turn of foot four wide at the three eighths pole but stalled by upper stretch and
had little to show finishing down the lane. MRS. HOT SHOT was in midfield three wide between foes on the first turn, settled between horses in the third tier
along the backside, was asked for more on the rail three furlongs remaining, offered little run and could not play a role in the stretch drive.
