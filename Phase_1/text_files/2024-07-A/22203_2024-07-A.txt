Footnotes
SPECIALIZED broke slowly, closed along the rail in upper stretch, attempted to shifted outside the leader near the furlong marker as that one drifted out
slightly, dropped back to the rail quickly, got through and proved best by a narrow margin under strong handling. EXCITEMENT veered out at the start,
stalked the pace three wide into the stretch, dug in late five wide and just missed. RECKLESS L J never far back, lacked room between rivals while three
wide in deep stretch and finished determinedly. SIMPLY VALID set a pressured pace in the two path into the stretch, drifted out slightly at the furlong marker
and was outfinished in the final stages. WILDCAT EXPRESS pressed the pace two wide then four wide into the stretch, was also in tight near the sixteenth
marker, checked and shifted out then lost momentum. WETZEL was outrun. OKLAHOMA JOE had speed into the turn then weakened.

Footnotes
MISTER MOBIL pressed the pace along the inside into the far turn, altered course three wide entering the stretch, drifted out to the seven path brushing the
runner up before the furlong marker, made the lead late and drew clear under strong handling. OAKS HONEY well placed, closed ground four wide into the
stretch, was brushed and forced out to the eight path nearing the furlong marker, dug in gamely and got up for second. VISUAL MISSION stalked the early
pace outside in the five path, made the lead nearing the far turn, set a pressured pace two wide until deep stretch then was outfinished. PRIVATE DRIVE
set a pressured pace off the rail in the four path, dropped inside on the far turn, kept on past the furlong marker and weakened late. MONSTER HUNTER
was no threat. SERVE REVENGE COLD was no factor. RED COMET trailed, stopped at the top of the stretch, was eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
YIPPEE KI YAY chased the pace along the inside, made the lead past mid turn, quickly opened a daylight advantage under left handed urging and
prevailed under confident handling. AFLEET O ME unhurried early, began to rally in the two path through upper stretch, sustained that bid while drifting out
to the six path late and finished clear for second. GOOD MUSIC stalked the pace in the five path and went evenly. SPOOKY LITTLE GIRL away alertly, set
the pace in the two path until late on the turn, drifted out through the stretch and weakened. TAMMY'S TOY was in tight at the start then failed to reach
contention. ORLEANS STORM offered little.
