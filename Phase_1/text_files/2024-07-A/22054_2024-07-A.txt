DEFIANT MALICE was reserved racing well off the early pace, picked up the tempo late on the turn, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied gamely and
ngot up in time. GO OTTO GO dueled for the early lead racing inside of DON JUAN BUBBA, battled on through the turn, cut the corner and shook free at
the head of the lane, continued to lead the way nearing the wire then got caught in final stride. DON JUAN BUBBA dueled outside of GO OTTO GO for the
early lead, battled on around the turn, was no match at the head of the lane but ran on and finished well clear over the rest. BARREL THIEF raced in the last
flight, had no response when called upon and dropped back in the lane. GEM COLLECTION tracked the clear top pair up the backstretch, chased around
the turn then retreated.

PRETTYWITTYANDWISE sped to the lead at the start, set the uncontested pace up the backstretch, continued clear still unasked around the turn, saved
ground entering the lane and drew off to an easy victory. LIL KNOCKOUT was the closest pursuer of the leader in early stages, chased two wide around the
turn, was no match for eventual winner, stayed on and held place. JANES GIRLS was off a bit slow at the start and raced in the back, chased four wide
around the turn, sustained bid into the lane and secured a share. JOYFUL IMAGE hustled along chasing after the early leader, sustained a three wide bid
through the turn then flattened in the lane. RUN FOR HOME raced off the early pace, saved ground into upper stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
GUNITE MAX was forwardly placed in pursuit of the early leader, moved up to engage rival a furlong out, took over the lead and finished going away.
JACKIE SPARROW sped to the lead at the start and led the way around the turn, got collared by the winner leaving the furlong marker and had to settle for
second best. FRIENDLY SPIRIT hustled along two wide around the turn, sustained a three wide bid into the lane and cleared a share. TAMMY O
SHANTER raced in early contention, saved ground into the head of the lane, ran on to mid-stretch then flattened out. WOMAN'S INTUITION chased along
the inside entering the turn then shifted out three wide near the mid-way point, ran on four wide into upper stretch but needed more for late impact.
ADETERMINEDMOM raced in contention in the early going then steadily weakened. P R SORRY KIDS was away near the back then quickly advanced into
closer contention, remained in range around the turn then faded in the lane. P R BIG WHEELS raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn and
never threatened. P R THAT'S JUDY raced off the early speed, came four wide into the lane and had no response. WONLITTLEDOLL dropped back after
the start and trailed throughout. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate
time.

Footnotes
ANNIEWAY U WANT IT sped to the lead at the start, set the pace and held firm over close pursuers around the turn, widened advantage a furlong out then
held late over late gaining duo. DIAMOND OF EKATI raced just off midppack in the early going, edged up into closer contention four wide at the quarter
pole, came out wider for the drive, roused for more, responded finished gamely and just missed. GARBO SPEAKS tracked the leader three wide, continued
in contention late on the turn, ran on into the lane, steadily edged up closer in the final sixteenth and got nipped for place. TOMMY'S CRUE raced in range
through the early going, moved into close contention three to four wide near the quarter pole, hustled along three wide into the head of the lane then evened
out mid-stretch. SHE'S SOLID SILVER was forwardly placed from the onset, continued to chase after the leader two wide around the turn then flattened in
the lane. CONFETTI BETTY was off a step slow at the start, raced off the early pace, hustled along three too four wide into upper stretch and lacked a
needed rally. CLIMB TO GLORY raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
INTERSTELLA raced in range along the rail in the early going, had to wait for a clear path along the inside around the turn, cut the corner entering upper
stretch, tipped two wide for the drive, responded when called upon and drew clear. OURPEPPERMINTCANDY sped to the lead soon after the start and set
the pace, held a slim lead over pursuers near the quarter pole, came two wide into upper stretch, cleared the lead, angled inside, continued on top then got
overtaken late. DIAL SUM IN was forwardly placed through early stages, edged closer and raced in aim at the quarter pole, could not move on for the lead
turning for home but stayed on with response and secured a share. DREAMIN IT UP raced in range up the backstretch, moved up into close contention at
the quarter pole, weakened off the lead entering the lane, ran on to mid-stretch then evened out. MY GOLDEN DAY raced up close up the backstretch,
chased two wide around the turn then weakened in the lane. ESPIRIDION lacked early speed, raced in the back and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
DELACINA vied inside of MY HEARTS ON FIRE for the early lead then shook free approaching the quarter pole, saved ground and widened advantage
entering upper stretch, fended off foes through the lane and kept clear under steady encouragement. CLASSIC CASH raced in the second flight late on the
backstretch, tracked the top trio around the turn, given cue three wide entering upper stretch, finished with good response and captured place. JADA was
forwardly placed from the onset, continued in contention around the turn, sustained bid for the leader into the lane and got caught for place in final stride.
RED SANGRIA raced off the early pace, swung five wide into the stretch and improved position. MORNINGNOONANDNITE raced off the early speed,
saved ground around the turn, tipped two to three wide for the drive and lacked a needed rally. SHANNON K was not too far back in early stages, failed to
advance under pressure around the turn and never threatened. WICKED HOT FOOT raced in range in the early going, weakened along the inside around
the turn and had no late response. MY HEART'S ON FIRE vied outside of eventual winner for the early lead, battled on into the turn, failed to match strides
approaching the quarter pole and gave way. GET THE LEAD OUT dropped back after opening stages and failed to move into contention. TYPHOON TIME
was distanced, pulled up leaving the turn and was transported off of the track via the equine ambulance. .
