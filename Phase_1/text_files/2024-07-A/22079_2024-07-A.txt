Footnotes
COYOTE ROAD battled along between horses to deep stretch in a gutsy effort through the late going to the wire. RAISON KARTER three wide trip dueling
all the way, good handling, game to wire. YES POINT inside run just off leaders to the stretch, weakened late stages. MAYNARD off rail run to far turn never
far back, leveled off stretch run. PICKFORD loped along to the half, outside run to far turn, no response. IMPROBABLE STORY brief inside speed, gave in
readily and lost contact with the field from the far turn and walked back to the barn area.
