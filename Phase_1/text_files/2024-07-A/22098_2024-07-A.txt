heads apart through the stretch drive and edged away late, driving. RITZ ON BROADWAY tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn, made an inside bid
at the quarter pole, dueled with the winner in the stretch run and came up second best. VOODOO PRIESTESS raced three wide on the first turn, stalked
close up two wide, chased on the far turn and finished evenly inside in the lane. RED RIVER SUSI raced off the pace inside and did not factor. LOVELY

Footnotes
PISTOL OR SHOTGUN chased five wide into the turn, under urging while widest around the bend, bid six wide in upper stretch, inched clear under a stout
drive. MIDNIGHT GETAWAY tracked the pace setters from the rail, accelerated quickly between runner nearing the three eighths pole, fought on inside rival
conceded grudgingly late. POSITIVELY AWESOME vied for the lead outside rival into the turn, under pressure between runners around the quarter pole,
had inside position for the stretch run, was outkicked to the wire. RAHMER very awkward start, trailed the field into the turn, mild gain through the stretch.
CLASS ACTOR vied inside for the lead into the turn, under a drive leaving the quarter pole, weakened through the stretch. There was a stewards inquiry
into the start of the race, after review RAHMER remained a starter.
