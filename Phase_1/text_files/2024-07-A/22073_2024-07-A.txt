Footnotes
MR HARRY tracked the pace to the far turn angling out into upper stretch surging late at mid track angling seven wide late getting up on the wire.
UNDERTOW sent clear was rated on pace to the far turn saving ground carrying a clear lead in upper stretch angling off the inside when threatened late
being grabbed on the wire. JACKSON MAN raced mid pack moving evenly to upper stretch holding position along the inside late. THIRD MOON slow early
saved ground to upper stretch finishing well along the rail. O'RIGSBY in close in the run to the first turn tracked evenly through the far turn into upper stretch
lacking needed surge there. PERFECT MOON stalked the pace to the far turn weakening into upper stretch. MY BOY CLYDE slow early played no factor.
TREASURER was never involved. KARMA DIRECTOR in close early raced evenly to the far turn tiring into upper stretch. AWESOME HONOR losing
ground early would tire.

Footnotes
DARK OAK in tight at the break was hustled clear early angling out in upper stretch drawing off as much the best. QUICK ENTRY slow early rallied outside
on the turn vying from mid track down the lane responding to save place. HONOR LIFE chased the pace racing four path down the lane finishing evenly.
MAS CHIKILIN was squeezed back at the break rushing to bid on the turn leveling off down the lane. VALEROSO chased the early pace tiring in upper
stretch. THE FILTER played no factor.
