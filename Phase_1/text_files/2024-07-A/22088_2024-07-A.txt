AND CHANGE prompted the pace from two wide to deep stretch then dug in and match strides outside of SCAMPERING MA'AM in the final seventy yards
under a determined drive. SCAMPERING MA'AM sprinted to a clear lead to set most of the pace but was collared in deep stretch and matched strides
inside of AND CHANGE in the final seventy yards but was denied. SHORT STACK rushed to contention while saving ground around the turn but was no
match for the top two. UNO PEA tracked the leaders from two or three wide through the turn but was empty in the drive. BALITRIX broke well from the gate
then faded early and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
PINCHING PENNIES stalked the pace from the inside around the first turn then had to steady at the five furlong marker, shifted out to three wide and
launched her bid at the three furlong marker to run down the leaders in deep stretch to be up in the final jumps. BROADWAY PEARL stalked the pace from
three wide to midway down the backstretch then moved up to make a bid at the half mile marker, engaged the leader at the quarter pole to take the lead into
the stretch but was overtaken in the final seventy yards to be denied. EVERLYN'S ANGEL roused to the front to take a clear lead around the first turn,
jumped a shadow past the six furlong marker and kept on, was headed at the quarter pole but couldn't fend off the challenge and gave way grudgingly.
MEGANS MILLIONS trailed the field around the first turn while saving ground, made a mild bid on the backstretch but failed to sustain that bid. GIGI'S LUV
raced off the pace from two wide to the seven sixteenths pole and dropped back.

kept on to match strides with DISTORTED MATH to the wire and won the nod. DISTORTED MATH pressed the pace from the inside down the backstretch
then had to check slightly at the three furlong marker but kept on to duel inside of ALL JACKED UP in the stretch but was outnodded. LAB'S RULER vied for
the lead from three wide down the backstretch then chased the leaders around the turn but was no match for the top two. TAP TO CONNECT trailed the
field and was not a factor. BET ALL THE GOLD had an awkward start, saved ground but was not a threat.

Footnotes
BRADFIELD BABY bumped with DOSS leaving the starting gate then pressed the pace from the inside down the backstretch, engaged leader at the three
furlong pole and matched strides inside of DOSS to just past the eighth pole and drew clear. DOSS broke through the starting gate prior to the start then
was reluctant to load, bumped with BRADFIELD BABY leaving the starting gate and was allowed to settle around the first turn, moved up from four wide on
the backstretch and engaged the leaders at the three furlong marker while matching strides outside of BRADFIELD BABY to just past the eighth pole and
weakened but proved second best. WESTERN STAR was pinched back at the start then trailed the field around the first turn, moved up from two wide on
the backstretch and made a late four wide bid at the quarter pole to be best of the rest. ANGOLA VACATION stalked the pace from three wide to midway
through the final turn, lacked the late response and tired. RISING KOTO STAR went to the front to set the pace from between horses for the first half and
gave way midway through the final turn.

matched strides with DOUBLEDIAMOND DEAL to the quarter pole and drew clear in the stretch. LIGHTNING STRUCK stalked the pace from three wide to
the top of the stretch then made a late bid to be second best. BUSINESS MODEL raced near the back to the top of the stretch and made a late four wide
rally to be up for the show. RIFEY was pinched back after leaving the starting gate and trailed the field to the three furlong marker then made a rail bid to
improve his position. DOUBLEDIAMOND DEAL broke inward leaving the gate then rushed up to a clear early lead from two wide then was pressured to the
turn, was headed at the three furlong marker and matched strides outside of HOLDEN THE LUTE to the quarter pole and gave way.
RUNNINGINTHEMONEY raced in the middle of the pack to midway through the turn then retreated.

Footnotes
MYSTERIOUS SPIRIT rushed up to prompt the pace from two wide around the first turn then co-led down the backstretch, edged away at the three furlong
marker to a wide lead and won going away. MOKINGS stalked the pace from three wide around the first turn then moved up at the half mile maker but
couldn't collar the leader and chased him around the turn and proved second best. COCAL was allowed to settle around the first turn then moved up from
four wide at the half mile maker for a mild bid on the final turn but flattened out. SHADY GRADY raced at the back down the backstretch then moved out the
three wide at the quarter pole and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. TAKEOVER FIFTYFOUR raced off the pace to the half mile marker while saving ground
but was not a factor. CHIEFWEAVE rushed up to a clear lead on the inside around the first turn then co-led down the backstretch to the half mile marker
and was done.
