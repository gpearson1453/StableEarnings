NOT THIS BOY tracked the pace early on, made a bid three wide nearing the lane, took over command once in the lane three wide and drew off late in the
stretch under a steady drive. RUN JALEN RUN came out at the start, set the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane and no match for the winner
in the stretch run. GIVE ME A REASON stalked the pace early, made a bid from between horses nearing the lane, was in the four path into the lane and
weakened late in the stretch drive. B FIFTY TWO was bumped at the start, raced in the five path into the lane and moved up in the stretch. MERIT was a
tad slow at the start and trailed the field early on, raced in the three path into the lane and improved position. BEAUDACIOUS COLTON was through after a
