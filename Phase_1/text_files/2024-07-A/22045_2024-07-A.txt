Footnotes
JOEY MUSCLES stalked in the six path, came under a ride from the four path passing the three-eighths pole, floated back out to the six path turning into the
lane, and stayed on to draw past an inner foe in the closing stages. CARAMBASO was prompted from in range in the five path, bid in the four path midway
around the turn, took command passing the quarter, kicked on to get slightly clear in upper stretch, but was caught by an outer foe late to place. NOBLE J
raced off the pace in the five path, advanced under coaxing around the turn, got carried out to the seven path turning into the lane, hung on his left lead, but
kept on for show. GALLANT KNIGHT set the pace in the three path, received a right handed cue in the two path when challenged by an outer foe midway
around the turn, but lost the lead before the quarter, and weakened in the stretch. MONEYLOVE chased in the three path but failed to bid. OLEG laid up
close along the inside early, but hit the rail and had to check passing the half, backed up around the turn and never threatened. GEORGEISIMPORTANT
trailed throughout.

PATTY'S HAVING FUN stalked in the five path, was coaxed along in the four path around the turn, bid from the five path turning into the lane, and drew
clear of an inner foe in the final sixteenth. SUPER SPIN prompted an inner duo from the four path, took command in the three path midway around the turn,
kept on while hanging in her left lead going into the final furlong, but yielded in the final sixteenth to place. BLACK BELT BARBIE vied for the lead in the two
path, was ridden into the turn, but lost ground while just off the rail midway around the turn, and was one paced along the inside for show. REAL MIKEY
raced off the pace in the three path, was coaxed along from the rail around the turn, but made no impact. TWIZZLE dueled for the early lead along the
inside but yielded around the turn.

SUNROOF bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the four path, moved up under coaxing rounding the far turn, bid at the top of the lane, kicked on
to lead passing the eighth pole, and safely held off an outer foe. FUNTASTICA slowly broke out at the start and trailed in the four path turning into the
backstretch, was ridden in the five path around the far turn, fanned out to the seven path entering the stretch, and rallied for place. MUSICAL JOURNEY
dueled for the lead inside, received a right handed cue midway around the far turn, dug in while facing an outer challenger in upper stretch, but flattened in
the final sixteenth to show. NAA DUDETTE raced wellback in the two path, came under right handed urging in the three path midway around the far turn,
tipped out to the six path at the top of the stretch, but made no impact. GRATIA vied for the lead in the three path but faded in the two path down the lane.
BULLET VALENTINA stalked in the three path but weakened in the four path down the stretch. POLA OF TROUBLE bumped with an outer foe at the start,
raced off the pace inside and never threatened. LUCEVAN LA STELLE tracked in the four path but was empty entering the stretch.

Footnotes
MY LADY JAMES stalked the pace three wide, took over leaving the five-sixteenths pole, drew clear in upper stretch and just lasted under a steady drive.
BEACH PARTY BINGO raced in range two wide early, angled four wide near the three-eighths pole and rallied through the lane to just miss. GIRVIN GIRL
pressed the pace two wide, briefly led between foes near the five-sixteenths marker, could not match strides the winner turning for home but kept on for the
show. ATALANTA ALEXANDRA saved ground in range, angled four wide turning for home and lacked the needed rally. LADY MAX failed to menace while
racing five wide. SLENDER SLIPPER played no factor while racing six wide. BRASHANKNOWIT set a pressured pace along the rail, yielded near the
five-sixteenths pole and wilted in the lane. CANT STOP DREAMING trailed inside.

STAT laid up close in the three path, bid confidently from the two path rounding the far turn, was roused from the three path at the top of the lane, took the
lead passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. NOVO SOL (BRZ) was unhurried in the four path early, received a right handed cue in the two path midway
around the far turn, and ran on from the three path down the stretch for place. BLUEBIRDS OVER had to steady early, tracked in the two path down the
backstretch, came under a ride along the inside midway around the far turn, swung out to the five path into the lane, and finished evenly for show. SOUPER
ENERGIZER steadied into the first turn, raced off the pace in the five path down the backside, was coaxed from the four path midway around the far turn,
but made no impact from the six path in the stretch. THEMANUPFRONT set the pace inside, was roused when challenged early around the far turn, but
faded in the stretch. EYES ON THE KING was reluctant to load, stalked in the four path, was coaxed in the three path midway around the far turn, floated
out to the six path turning into the stretch, but flattened. STARSHIP RENEGADE rated inside but never menaced.
