Footnotes
CAJUN NINJA pressed the pace while to wide into the turn, came under a drive in the early stretch to edge past the pace setter and take over the lead then
drew clear to prevail. ATLANTIC STRIKE chased the pace from the inside, then rallied bid leaving the bend while three, was able to get up for the place
position in the late stretch but could not catch the leader. EQUILOVE (IRE) chased the pace between rivals, then settled back at the top of the turn, rebid in
the upper stretch while coming out five wide and was able to get up for the show prize at the wire. LET FREEDOM BLING was away well to set the pace
from the inside, was in a long drive on the turn while being pressed by an outer foe, then gave way in the early stretch. MOR PEANUTS chased while three
wide, angled in to the two path at the top of the turn while urging eagerly, came out four wide in the upper stretch and lacked rallying.

Footnotes
CITYCITYBLINGBLING led the way briefly before being challenged by outer foes leaving the backstretch, vied on the turn before pulling away to go
shoulder to shoulder with NOBLE AWARE, was in an all out drive and was up at the wire to prove best. NOBLE AWARE moved up from the two path to bid
between the leaders, battled throughout the turn, cleared the outer rival and continued to spar gamely with CITYCITYBLINGBLING down the lane and hung
at the wire. HEY COWGIRL saved ground while racing towards the back early, then steadily moved up while three wide on the turn, rallied in the upper
stretch to get up for the show winnings and best the rest of the field. HOLIDAY CRUISE laid off the pace along the rail throughout, then rallied a mild bid in
the late stretch and never threatened. WILD STEEL trailed behind the field early, then rallied bid coming off the turn while four wide but it was too little too
late. BLAKE'S SONG prompted the pace while three wide, moved up to battle with inner foes throughout the turn and in a hard drive, was used up and
weakened in the stretch. JUST TICKLED chased the pace from the inside briefly and failed to rally after the turn. PAPIRINGA was no menace.

Footnotes
PRONUNCIATION tracked the pace from the inside in the early stages, was roused heading into the far turn, shifted four wide and outside of rivals, gained
command mid stretch and held on well while in a strong drive to prevail. PANTHERA settled back to the two path on the backstretch, came under a hand
drive on the far turn, found the best stride in the late stretch and was closing in on the leader and hung at the wire. CALLIN FOR DOLLARS was shuffled
back at the start, then trailed early, swung seven wide leaving the far turn, dug in gamely and was able to get up for the show position besting the rest of the
field. MIZ RITHYM was allowed to settle in the back flight while three wide, continued to save ground on the far turn, swung six wide to rally bid in the early
stretch and kept on down the lane just missing the show prize. SWEET KARAT CAKE was forwardly placed in the two path, then moved up to vie between
rivals in the late backstretch, continued to stalk the emerging leader on the far turn, rallied bid in the upper stretch and kept on gamely then was out finished.
MAGENS BAY broke outwardly and brushed foe, then raced mid pack while two wide down the backstretch, fanned out five wide leaving the far bend to
rally a mild bid in the stretch while battling between rivals and needed more. SHE'S A READER laid off the pace while four wide on the first turn, then moved
up to vie with inner foes, gained command at the top of the far turn and into the early stretch, could not retain bid and gave way. SHE'S A GOLD LADY
established the pace heading into the backstretch, then was challenged by two outer foes at the half to battle heading into the far turn, was used up and
tired in the stretch. KOLLYNS JULIE was brushed at the start, was allowed to settle at the back along the rail, then checked up on the far turn and failed to
rally.

Footnotes
STIRRING UP DUST pressed the pace while two wide, inched up to battle between rivals on the turn, then dug in gamely to shake clear in the late stretch
and held on well to the wire. COWGIRL DREAM was off slowly, then urged steadily on the turn, angled out four wide in the upper stretch, rallied bid and
passed tired foes to be up for the place prize. LA VONDA SECURITY laid off the leaders along the rail, then came out five wide leaving the turn, rallied a
mild bid in the late stretch and kept on for the show winnings. GAB'S HUMOR sped along the rail to take over the lead at the nine sixteenths, then vied with
two outer foes on the turn, could not regain the lead and gave way. CHECKER'S SONG veered inwardly, was allowed to settle while two wide in the early
furlongs, then rallied while three wide in the late stretch but it was too late. GLOBAL HOLIDAY was hindered at the start, tucked along the rail towards the
back, then rallied a mild bid in the late stretch and was no threat. WHAT MAGGIE WANTS led briefly before pressing the emerging leader while three wide,
moved up to vie on the turn while in a hard drive, was up and weakened in the late stretch. EAGLE PI was no factor.

Footnotes
WICKED SONG was coaxed early to set the pace at the six furlong marker, was pressed by an outer foe throughout, dug in gamely at the top of the stretch,
cleared said rival and lasted to the wire to prevail. BLING BABY broke inwardly and bumped foe, then saved ground down the backstretch while racing in
fourth position, was moving up while three wide leaving the turn, rallied bid was no match for the leader and held place. MOLA MIA drifted outwardly and
bumped foe, then pressed the pace while two wide, rallied bid on the turn, could not overpower the leader and gave way down the lane. GEE SHE'S
FANCY was bumped at the start, raced mid pack while two wide, trailed on the turn, then rallied a mild bid in the late stretch and came up empty.
LEXINGTON DIVA was unhurried early, then bid leaving the bend and lacked responding in the stretch. CUPID'S MUSIC was no threat. CRESSONS LIL
CHARM stalked the pace from the inside, shifted three wide at the top of the turn to rally a mild bid then flattened out in the stretch. AVALING was bumped
at the start, trailed early and was no menace. DIVERTIDA failed to rally.

FAYETTE BLUE veered outwardly, showed the way from the inside, was pressured by an outer foe down the backstretch, cleared said foe on the far turn
and lasted to the wire while in an all out drive to prove best. CASHMERE DANCER tracked the pace from the inside while saving ground in the early stages,
came out three wide leaving the far turn, then closed well down the lane and just missed victory. CLAUDETTE HEIR was forwardly place while two wide to
press the pace down the backstretch, could not outbid the leader heading into the far turn and gave way in the stretch. XTRA SPICY never threatened.
CAIRO MOON was no threat. HOURGLASS FIGURE was no menace. MY PATRIOTIC GIRL failed to menace. HAILEY'S JEWEL was no menace. GREY
HALO stalked the pace from the inside in the early furlongs then faded on the far turn and was no rally. SWEET DYNASTY was impeded at the start and
was no factor.
