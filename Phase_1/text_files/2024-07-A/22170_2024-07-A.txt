Footnotes
TOJO'S MOJO sped to the early lead, set the pace near the rail around the turn, drifted out in mid stretch while clear and was kept under a drive. FIRE PIT ,
rated back entering the turn, chased the pace outside the winner, altered course to the inside approaching the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. SPEEDY
ALEX saved ground around the turn, remained near the rail in the stretch and finished willingly. LIAM'S THE GREAT , steadied lacking room near the three
eighths pole, chased the pace two wide and weakened. SCHRADER lacked speed, raced well off the rail and was not a factor. SINETIC , three wide around
the turn, drifted to the five path at the head of the stretch and gave way. An objection by the rider of FIRE PIT against the winner for alleged interference in
the stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
ENEMYNUMBERNINE , brushed at the break, settled back off of a contested pace while removed from the rail, angled four wide leaving the three eighths
and ramped up a run, ranged up to engage STORMY MIDNIGHT in upper stretch, dueled outside that one from mid stretch, drifted in some and drove clear
at the wire. STORMY MIDNIGHT set a pressured pace towards the inner rail, moved clear past the five sixteenths, was guided outward when meeting the
winner's bid in upper stretch, battled gamely inside that one past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly through the final yards. MAJESTY'S FREEDOM
dropped off the pace while saving ground, angled three wide under pressure into the stretch and offered a mild rally. BLUE TRILLION bore out at the break,
corrected and edged up to stalk the embattled leaders, had aim three wide past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on between foes nearing the lane and
weakened. FROSTY MAYA drifted out at the break and brushed with the winner, disputed the pace outside STORMY MIDNIGHT, stayed latched to that one
to about the five sixteenths, failed to match strides soon after then tired through the final furlong. MOLLY OF STRATFORD , along the inside with pursuit,
failed to go on under a ride nearing the lane and dropped back.

PLAY LIKE A RAVEN settled off the pace, edged up two to three wide into the lane, knifed between rivals and under strong handling near the sixteenth
marker, took command inside of BANDITSGOLDENCHILD soon after and held firm. BANDITSGOLDENCHILD , taken to rate while saving ground, made a
nice move past the five sixteenths, shifted out four wide soon into the lane, closed in under pressure, took a slim lead outside IRISH HERO with about a
sixteenth to go, could not resist the winner's bid but kept on gamely to the wire. IRISH WARLOCK broke a step slow, was urged up off the inside, lost
ground four wide from the three eighths then advanced between rivals late to finish with interest. MUST BE LOVE stalked three to four wide, was under a
stout hand ride mid turn, fanned six wide for the drive, churned on outside rivals past the sixteenth marker then flattened out. MISTER AGENT , urged
forcing the pace outside IRISH HERO into the turn, stayed on as that one cleared, drifted five wide with pursuit into the stretch, failed to kick on past the
sixteenth pole and faded. IRISH HERO rushed up between runners to take the lead, set a pressured early pace towards the inside, shook clear around the
turn, maintained the advantage under a drive two wide past the three sixteenths, failed to resist foes leaving the sixteenth pole and weakened late. K KAKE
POP gave early chase between runners then dropped back around the turn.

PEYTON ELIZABETH settled three to four wide and within range of a contested pace, cruised up four wide outside the leaders nearing the lane, took over
after being asked soon after, opened up under a stout drive in mid stretch then was kept alert to deep stretch. I CAN RUN , fidgety in the gate, was
unprepared as the gates sprung and away last, recovered and was nudged up between rivals into the first turn, was put to pressure between runners near
the half, dropped back a bit leaving the three eighths, altered out to the center of the track inside the three sixteenths, straightened and finished up with
good energy to be second best. CARROLL GIRL , three wide early, moved up and engaged the leader from her outside nearing the backstretch, dueled
from the half to the quarter pole, stayed on and clung to the place spot past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly in the final seventy yards. ALWAYS
LAUGHING grabbed the early lead, set the pace towards the inside while shadowed, sparred with CARROLL GIRL from the far turn to the quarter pole,
continued with effort to about mid stretch then faded. HAINT BLUE , off the pace three wide, was put to a ride leaving the far turn and failed to respond.
DUNVEGAN DOLL saved ground stalking the pace, failed to kick on after five eighths and gave way.

FOREVER SOUPER assumed the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail and readily drew out through the stretch while under urging. HIGHLAND
CHIEF (IRE) , a forward factor outside the winner, chased him to mid way on the far turn, raced three deep leaving the turn, bumped with HARDSPUN
REASON at the head of the lane and weakened. THE ADDISON POUR , steered inward approaching the first turn, hugged the inner rail on the far turn,
bumped with HARDSPUN REASON at the head of the stretch and weakened. HARDSPUN REASON , unhurried early, advanced in narrow quarters
between horses leaving the far turn and was jostled on both sides at the top of the lane. Objections by the riders of THE ADDISON POUR and HARDSPUN
REASON against HIGHLAND CHIEF for alleged interference near the quarter pole were not allowed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run into
the stretch but no action was taken.

Footnotes
WHENIGETTOHEAVEN had speed to the inside of TIDEWATER then was rated back off that one entering the turn, eased back out and spied that one
heading into the lane, ranged up to engage near the three sixteenths, dueled on a slim lead through the final furlong and held firm under a drive.
TIDEWATER vied outside the winner then cleared into the turn, dropped in and set a rated pace, dug in when collared leaving the quarter pole, ceded the
lead near the mid stretch, dueled and stayed on valiantly to the wire. GREAT IDEA drifted out some at the break, corrected and flashed speed to the inside
of rivals then eased back off the leaders after about a furlong, advanced inside while under coaxing past the five sixteenths, shifted out in upper stretch,
gave hard pursuit of the top pair and continued with good effort to steadily bridge the gap. MISSION MAN dropped in early and settled off the pace, saved
ground into and through the lane and churned on to gain in the final furlong. HAD TO HAVE HIM broke a step slow, regrouped and saved ground, worked
outward past the five sixteenths, came five wide for the drive and finished with interest. MATTA tracked the leaders while about three wide, was under
pressure to the outside of GREAT IDEA into the stretch, lacked a punch nearing mid stretch and faded. SUE LOVES BARBADOS , off the pace and
removed from the inside, failed to generate a rally. TIZ NO CLOWN , squeezed back at the break, saved ground leaving the far turn but lacked a kick.
BUMP N RUN , forced out a bit at the break, gave some early pursuit just off the inside then weakened.
