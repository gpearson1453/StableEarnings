RANDELLO prompted the pace two wide for five furlongs, made the lead, drifted to the five path entering the stretch, responded under mild right handed
urging and drew clear. VAIL OF HONOR unhurried inside, swung out to the seven path entering the stretch and rallied for second. ITASCA away alertly, set
the pace for five furlongs, kept on into the stretch and weakened late. LAZARUS PROJECT hopped at the start, moved closer in the three path before a half
then faded in the stretch. CAMBIASO was no factor. KERANOS was through after a half.

Footnotes
ROLL ON MAX prompted the pace two wide past the three furlong marker, made the lead, shook clear in upper stretch and won under an energetic hand
ride. SWAYBACK MOBIL was bumped at the start, unhurried, closed willingly in the five path through the stretch and finished clear for second. BUMPKIN
set a pressured pace along the inside into the turn, kept momentum into the stretch and weakened late. MOBIL MISSION failed to menace. WEEKEND
RETREAT was unruly in the post parade, fractious in the gate, trailed early and passed tiring rivals in the three path. ITSMYLUCKYCOYNE with the second
flight two wide, lacked the needed response. AFTER SUNRISE also fractious in the gate, broke inward bumping SWAYBACK MOBILE at the start, stalked
the pace into the stretch then faltered. SKUNK APE was no threat. EL CHAPIADOR was outrun.

finished determinedly. GREEK BOUTIQUE pressed the pace two wide until deep stretch and was outfinished. BUCKEYE BLUE was no threat. EBONY'S

match for the winner. RIPLEY EFFECT went evenly. HERO'S DAUGHTER pressed the pace for a half, stopped, was eased in upper stretch and jogged to
the wire. CHERU well placed, pulled up ion the far turn and was walked off.

Footnotes
VERTISALUTE had speed from the start three wide, drew on even terms for the lead midway on the turn, drifted to the seven path entering the stretch,
gained a narrow lead at the furlong marker, drifted in under right handed urging to the two path and proved best by a narrow margin. VAL'S TWINSTAR set
the early pace along the rail dueled through the turn and then length of the stretch and just missed in a game effort. THIRTY SOMETHING stalked the pace
through the turn, drifted to the middle of the racetrack giving up ground at the top of the stretch and came on again late for a minor share. THELMA
LUCILLE offered a mild bid in the three path in upper stretch then leveled off. BOLD RUBY prompted the early pace two wide, matched strides through the
turn and weakened in the stretch. A P'S RUNAWAY DIVA was no threat. CAT'S PURSUIT was no factor. SOMETHING LUCKY settled wide and trailed.

Footnotes
GEMSHINE prompted the pace two wide into the turn, gained a narrow lead approaching the top of the stretch, was headed by the runner up near the
furlong marker, dug in determinedly while drifting to the six path and got back up in time. CANELA FINA bore out at the start bumping hard with BOLD
NICKY, trail down the backstretch, closed ground rapidly inside rivals through the turn, shifted out four wide splitting rivals, made the lead before the furlong
marker while drifting out to the seven path then was denied. WINGS OF HEAVEN settled five wide early, angled in to the three path on the turn, then
improved position late in the six path. RALPH'S LIL' VICKY bore in at the start, rushed to the lead soon thereafter, set a pressured pace along the inside
through the turn and weakened in the stretch. THE LITTLE THINGS had speed for three furlongs then gave way. DEBBIE'S DREAM stalked the early pace
three wide and faltered in the stretch. BOLD NICKY was bumped hard at the start and had brief speed. BLUE MOJITO was through early.
