Footnotes
LIVE LUCKY broke inwards on the break, quickly took over control by the half, was unopposed throughout the turn, had more when set down for the drive
and coasted home, not challenged down the stretch for the win. JUNIOR HOT SHOT was under hard restraint trying to maintain position in tight
surroundings down the backside, settled into stride on the fence around the bend watching the top two and finished up well, but could not reel in the
frontrunning winner who had it all his own way. SUMMER COMMANDER tracked three wide with horses on either side at the half, improved to chase the
pacesetting winner around the turn, could not find more in the stretch drive and faded but held for the show award. YACHT BOY was bumped slightly on the
break, tried to advance on the rail to get better forward position down the back straight, had to be steadied sharply when in tight quarters on the fence at the
three eighths marker and re-rallied slightly to get up for a minor role in the end. GAROFOLI broke sharp to lead in the beginning, angled in a touch when
chasing the frontrunner down the backstretch, was shuffled four wide outside foes into the turn, could not keep pace with the lead trio throughout the bend
and tired outside down the lane. STEWRDS INQUIRY AT THE THREE FURLONG MARKER ?REGARDING #1 YACHT BOY AND #3 JUNIOR HOT SHOT

Footnotes
SMALL TALK was content to watch the frontrunner in the beginning, moved in smartly outside at the five sixteenths marker, seized control outside the
leader in upper stretch and cruised on home for the impressive score. JMR SPEEDY ESCAPE settled on the inside in the third flight down the backside,
tracked the top two runners around the bend, shifted out in the three path with three sixteenths from home and closed in late to capture the place share right
at the wire. HE'S FULLY LOADED took this field down the backside, set the pace through the turn, was headed outside by the winner at the quarter pole
and faded late, losing second money in a photo at the finish line. PRINCE OF THIEVES stalked near the rear down the backstretch, made little headway
running around the bend, shifted outside off tiring foes in the four path with three sixteenths remaining and finished up willingly for a minor role in the end.
TOWN'S WARRIOR travelled in mid-division three deep down the back straight, inched closer through the turn, closed in to duel four wide outside horses
for the show award in upper stretch, but stalled between rivals at the furlong marker. TOURIST'S DREAM broke slow to begin, co-trailed on the inside of a
rival down the backstretch, status was unchanged throughout the turn, shifted four wide at the top of the stretch but made little presence down the lane.
DREAM ON BABY travelled outside foes in the third tier along the backside, settled in midfield two wide between horses on the turn making little headway
and lacked a finish in the drive to wire. REMEMBERING RHODA co-trailed on the outside in the early stages, was still in last, swinging outside to be widest
in the five path for the stretch drive and could not get involved down the lane.

Footnotes
FLIRTING WITH FIRE was away alertly for the lead, put away the early challenger when pressed at the half mile marker, opened up, while travelling
comfortably at the three furlong pole, was let out a notch, rationing his speed to repel another foe at the top of the stretch and won going away down the
lane with an impressive front end win. KEKOA tracked the duo outside at the half, took up the chase on the pacesetter midway around the bend, loomed the
only threat outside turning for home, was no match for the winner who had plenty more in the tank and still finished up well to be a clear but distant second
at the wire. LONNY'S GAMBLE travelled on the rail in midfield down the back straight, saved ground, keeping pace around the bend, angled outside in the
five path at the top of the lane and rallied smartly to garner third money at the finish. GOLDEN TEST broke out on the start, settled outside horses in
mid-pack, three deep down the backstretch, was roused midturn to edge closer behind the lead pair at the top of the stretch and finished up willingly but lost
the show battle in the stretch. OK SPEEDY showed little early foot to begin, was hustled down the backside trying to get better positioning after the start,
made no progress having only one foe beaten through the bend and passed a struggling rival outside at the furlong marker. SAINT GRAAL CHEVAL
brushed to outer part of the gate on the break, forced the issue inside at the half, was shuffled back losing some lengths to the frontrunner at the three
furlong pole, chased the top pair around the turn and wilted on the rail by mid-stretch. MAD CHATTER trailed inside at the half, lost touch with the field
through the turn and could not be involved in the drive to the wire.

Footnotes
WALTER ME LAD bobbled ever so slightly at the start but quickly recovered and moved forward along with and outside the pacesetter pressing that one up
the backstretch, bid near the five-sixteenths taking a narrow lead, was in charge under urging in upper stretch, edged away slowly but steadily under
moderate urging in the lane. BASKETBALL JONES set the pace inside facing outside pressure from the eventual winner, was overtaken by that one in
upper stretch, kept on under urging but was only second best. SECRET STORM broke a step slowly, moved forward between foes up the backstretch,
chased in behind the leading pair on the turn racing near the inside, continued to chase fruitlessly through the lane and failed to rally. TREBUCHET settled
off the leaders inside saving ground on the turn, came out four wide in upper stretch, was unable to threaten. SNOOKERED broke outwardly a bit, stalked
up close about three to four wide into the turn, swung out a bit further for the drive, failed to rally. RYE'S MY GUY dropped back to last up the backstretch
and switched outside a foe before the turn, raced just outside on that bend before swinging six deep turning for home, made no bid.

Footnotes
WHERE IS ESSA was brushed inside on the start, settled in midfield between foes in the two path down the backstretch, travelled in the tracking flight
inside through the turn, shifted out to the three path for clear run at the top of the lane, determinedly went by rivals and held safe at the wire for the win.
ADELAIDE COURT was brushed outside on the break, stalked near the rear ahead of only one foe down the back straight, stalked in the third flight inside
going around the bend, was urged at the quarter pole closing in behind the leaders, weaved smartly through rivals while in tight quarters through the lane
and gamely fought to the wire but was second best on this day. SPEEDY PAL had a slim lead on the rail with four furlongs remaining, dueled inside up front
through the turn, re-rallied for the lead in mid-stretch but could not find more late to fend off the winner and another foe late. HE SHOOTS HE WINS was
situated on the outside three deep watching the contesting duo down the backside, tracked on the rail in the second flight around the turn, was in the hunt
outside foes in the four path turning for home but was one paced in the stretch and settled on the fringes. GOLD MAGIC pressed the pace outside at the
half, battled outside around the bend, poked her head in front briefly at the quarter pole, was clinging onto the lead between horses in upper stretch and
yielded in the two path in the final sixteenth. APRIL DE VELP broke slowly to begin, could not find her stride trailing by many down the backstretch and
showed some run late to pass a weary contestant in deep stretch. DISSECTOLOGIST settled on the outside of rivals, three deep along the backside,,
stalked in the third flight on the outside through the turn, was roused for more with five sixteenths to go, offered little response and folded in deep stretch.

ONTARIO broke a step slowly, was allowed to settled at the rear outside, bided time till the turn, began to advance willingly five wide, swept to the front six
deep by the furlong marker and was just shaken up at that point, drew off under mild hand urging and was ridden out. CATCH THE DRIFT stalked mid-pack,
advanced four wide on the turn, took the lead at the three-sixteenths but that was short-lived, proved no match for the winner but second best. MRS. C
settled between at the rear, was encouraged three to four wide on the turn, came out further still near the eighth pole, ran on to secure show honors.
SILENT AND SINFUL was lightly bumped just after the start, had forward position tracking inside, saved ground on the turn, needed more in the stretch.
GENIUS OF LOVE stalked from outside mid-pack, was ridden along four wide at the five-sixteenths, came out six wide for the drive, failed to rally in the
stretch. MIA MITOLE bumped with a foe at the start, raced inside toward the rear, shuffled back to last about the three-eighths, swung seven wide turning
for home, passed tired rivals. ONDINE LADY was quick to take command, set the pace inside, faltered and faded. HOULIHAN stalked in hand and in range
mostly three to four wide, weakened. TOWN'S A BREEZE steadied just slightly after the break and entering the gap, switched out two wide at that point,
raced off the pace mostly two to three deep and was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
LITTLE TEDDY bumped with a rival at the start, was ridden from the break but lacked early speed, switched out and advanced soon after going three to four
wide on the turn, floated out a path leaving that bend then drifted in just a hair while making a bid near the eighth pole, struck the lead and straightened out
under left-handed urging, dueled to the wire and just held from the inside foe. OLIVIA ROSE stalked just off the leader, went two to three wide on the turn,
bid nearing the eighth pole but was in a bit tight between foes, kept on thereafter dueling inside the winner but could not get by that one and missed.
STRIKE A CHORD quickly moved clear, shifted in and set the pace near the rail, drifted out just a bit in upper stretch then came in a bit in mid-stretch when
challenged, had no extra. JUST FOLLOW ME was lightly bumped at the start, tracked from inside, saved ground racing just in behind the leaders, lacked
room on the rail nearing the sixteenth pole and altered out but was left with too much to do. TABLOID MATERIAL moved out off the rail, was never a threat.
FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF OLIVIA ROSE AGAINST LITTLE TEDDY ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, NO
ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
PLAYMEA TUNE was off a step slow to begin, recovered to be nestled smartly on the fence behind the contesting duo along the backside, waited for his
cue from the rider saving ground behind the leaders through the turn, pounced in the two path with clear run in upper stretch and exploded on by with an
impressive turn of foot at the furlong marker for the eye catching win. WAR STRATEGY pressed the pace inside at the start, emerged with the lead on the
fence at the half, edged away from the other speed foe by the quarter pole, had no resistance to give when challenged outside by the winner in mid-stretch
and just held on the save the runner up share at the wire. WESTERN WHIRL had a slim lead outside early on, hounded the pacesetter outside by the half,
chased the frontrunner on the turn, was no match for the winner who had another gear in the stretch but did resurge late to make it a close finish for the
place share in the end. PAINTTHETOWNSILVER was situated in midfield, two wide with runners on both sides, came under a ride when scrubbed on at the
three eighths marker but was losing ground on the turn, was asked right handed at the top of the lane and finished up willingly to settle on the fringes in the
end. TOUR THE CITY hopped slightly on the start, was allowed to gather himself trailing down the backside, rallied past a rival on the fence through the
turn, skimmed the rail turning for home but offered no kick in the drive to the wire. ROI SOLEIL travelled in midfield three deep outside challengers along the
backside, moved to be beside the eventual winner by the quarter pole in the hunt three wide, shifted out to be in the four path for the drive, had nothing left
to give in the stretch and flattened out at the furlong marker. POSTURING hopped on the break, stalked three wide near the rear in the early going, had no
run to offer on the turn to be last at the top of the stretch and could not be a factor in the stretch running.

Footnotes
CLASSIC MO TOWN settled at the rear two to three wide early, moved out and raced outside still trailing into the far turn, fanned from four to eight wide
turning for home, took aim, rallied strongly and drove past late. QUITE READY tucked in to the rail saving ground in behind the leaders, continued to ride
the rail till mid-stretch, was guided out four deep at that point, rallied between runners to get up for place. HAVE IT MY WAY settled off the pace two to three
wide early, was between foes heading to the far turn, waited till the top of the stretch then angled out five to six deep, closed well but was outfinished for
second. CRUMLIN LAD was forwardly-positioned settling off the leader stalking in behind that runner early, raced mostly two to three wide, advanced
rapidly to put a short head in front briefly at the seven-sixteenths, was turned back soon after later on the turn, re-bid between runners nearing the furlong
grounds, was outkicked. FOREST BUZZ settled a couple lengths off and outside the pacesetter racing four wide, bid outside at the eighth pole, could not
sustain the effort and lacked the needed late kick. MAD DOG N JOE sprinted clear, set the pace from just off the fence, met the bid of an outside foe
responding to that one's pressure at the seven-sixteenths, turned back that rival edging clear again, was overtaken a second time in mid-stretch and lacked
the needed late bid. PINE KNOLL got away well and was allowed to settle dropping back off the pace, saved ground and was never near enough to
threaten. KING ELVIS rated outside three to four wide then five wide up the backstretch and within range, dropped back on the far turn and went evenly
thereafter. GUNS N' ROJAS dropped right back to last early, was never near enough to threaten while racing just off the inside.

Footnotes
SOCIETY'S THUNDER engaged for the lead in between horses in the two path down the backside, began to edge away mildly up front at the three eighths
marker, shook clear from the pesky rival at the furlong pole and was kept to the task to hold safe at the finish line. EL COHETE pressed the issue on the rail
down the backstretch, continued to slug it out on the fence in the turn, battled intently inside from the three eighths pole to the furlong marker, shifted out to
the three path in deep stretch but chased in vain to be a game second in the end. UNCAPTURED MOMENT was brushed inside at the start, travelled
behind the front foursome early in the backstretch, watched the three leaders between horses midturn, was reminded left handed at the three eighths
marker, angled out with some momentum in the four path straightening for home and got up in the last jump to settle on the fringes. CANADIAN AVRO was
brushed outside to begin, settled on the rail in mid-division down the backstretch, sat behind the lead trio on the rail through the turn, closed in at the quarter
pole behind the contesting duo in upper stretch, stayed on the fence down the lane, finished up mildly but lost the battle for the minors. BEARING DOWN
was reined back off the lead trio travelling in the four path down the backstretch, tracked three wide in the second tier through the turn, shifted back out four
wide turning for home, could not find another gear late and was one paced to the wire. STONKS could see the field down the back straight, began to pass
foes three wide at the half, angled out to be six wide at the top of the stretch but failed to menace to the finish line. BREAK THE SPELL stalked close to the
back on the fence in the early stages, was hard ridden between foes but offered little response at the half, angled out to the four path in the stretch but was
empty for the drive to the wire. SMART ALMASTY stalked near the rear outside down the back straight, was urged at the half, could not improve through the
turn on the fence and could only pass a tired one down the lane. DREAM JEREEM prompted the pace three deep in the early stages, began to give way
three wide at the three eighths marker, angled out in the five path for the drive but stopped at the furlong marker.
