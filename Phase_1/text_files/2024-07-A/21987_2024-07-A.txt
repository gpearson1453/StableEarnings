Footnotes
APRIL ANTICS was urged along off the pace, moved in late on the backstretch, went around most of the turn in the two path, shifted three then four wide
outside the quarter-pole, pursued the runner-up while put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch, gained to make a bid inside the furlong marker, took the
advantage under a hand-ride into the final sixteenth and proved best under good handling. TRADE SECRET tracked the pace down the backstretch, made
a bid at the seven-sixteenths pole, vied in the three path on the turn, took the advantage at will outside the quarter-pole, was set down in upper stretch,
came under a right-handed crop inside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop while clinging to a lead outside the sixteenth-pole then was caught
while far clear for the place. DIVA BANKER broke awkwardly and was last to commence, chased the pace on the outside, pursued the leader in the four
path for most of the turn then moved to the five path and weakened but was clear for the show. SLACK TIDE was hustled from the gate, established a good
position down the backstretch, chased inside for most of the turn then shifted to the two path, spun three wide into the stretch, drifted in and out from the
crop in the drive and tired. GRINGOTTS bobbled at the start but broke with the field, settled at the rear, was urged along late on the backstretch, rounded
most of the turn in the two path then dropped to the inside, moved out inside the three-sixteenths pole and failed to threaten. BEAUTIFUL KAREN angled in
while hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked near the rail while under threat on the turn, lost the advantage outside the
quarter-pole, turned into the stretch in the two path and faded.

Footnotes
SHEHANAH broke out at the start, chased along the inside until tipped to the two path placed to coaxing nudging MAXING THE BANK three wide at that
station, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong seizing command a sixteenth from home, then edged clear
to the finish to prevail. DANCING LIANA cut the pace in hand from the two path down the backstretch, tucked inside into the turn engaged by WELCOME
BACK BABE to the outside, dueled through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive shaking off her main pace foe when being confronted by the top one, got collared at the sixteenth marker and ran on to preserve the place honors.
WELCOME BACK BABE coaxed from the start, raced four then three wide in aim of the front before advancing to duel from the three path with DANCING
LIANA to the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish to procure the show honors.
MONTAUK MYSTIQUE chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper
stretch, weakened in the drive. ANNIEWORKSTOOMUCH broke out at the start and was corrected coming in to force TERESA to steady when bumping
that rival into MAXING THE BANK, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch before going three to four wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and weakened in the stretch. NOBLE DISGUISE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the
inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. TERESA
broke out at the start and had ANNIEWORKSTOOMUCH come inwards after also breaking out, got bumped by that foe and in turn bumped MAXING THE
BANK and was forced to lightly steady conceding four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased seven paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then four wide through the turn, went six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. MAXING THE BANK bobbled at the start and was
bumped by TERESA due to pressure from ANNIEWORKSTOOMUCH, chased two to three wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn
and was nudged three wide by SHEHANAH when placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
PAROS was taken under a tight hold early, saved ground on the first turn, was rated off the pace, drafted in the two path while behind traffic on the far turn,
was asked after turning into the stretch, steadied while blocked from near the furlong marker to outside the sixteenth-pole, altered out for room at that
juncture then rallied on the outside and closed fast under a hand-ride to get up and prevail. KURAMATA (IRE) was taken in hand early, went around the first
turn in the two path, dropped to the rail onto the backstretch, was rated just off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, was asked while impatiently ridden
nearing the five-sixteenths, bumped with ROCKET AND ROLL while trying to get out at that juncture then steadied, was roused again while still on the turn
but continued to be kept in by the aforementioned opponent, came out for room in upper stretch and nudged that foe out, gained to make a bid outside the
furlong marker, took the lead outside the sixteenth-pole, led until the final strides but was denied then pulled up in distress and was transported off the
course via equine ambulance. SO HIGH (GB) went to the front, was well rated in hand while setting the pace and racing inside on the turns, responded well
when asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the runner-up outside the sixteenth-pole, fought on well to
the finish but missed while clear for the show. HIGH TIDE was sluggish into stride and fell back early, went two to three wide on the first turn, settled at the
rear, moved from the two path to the four path on the far turn then shifted five wide outside the quarter-pole, came six wide into upper stretch and lacked the
needed kick. ROCKET AND ROLL went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn then bumped
by KURAMATA near the five-sixteenths pole, kept that foe in behind horses into the stretch then was bumped again by the aforementioned foe, dropped
back into the final furlong and tired. TIBERIUS MERCURIUS was hustled from the gate, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside, was
asked while three then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
LIGHT MAN coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive rallying through the final furlong to collar the leader in the final strides to the finish. KINGDOM broke out at the start and came under coaxing to show
the way in hand three paths off the rail down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the turn, remained patiently handled until placed to light
coaxing swinging four wide into upper stretch, got roused outside the eighth pole, dug in under a left handed crop and came outwards three paths a
sixteenth from home just before being caught by the top one while also forcing DAUFUSKIE ISLAND to take light and paused in behind and to the outside
and was along for the place honors. DAUFUSKIE ISLAND stumbled at the start conceding only about a half a length to a length to the leader quickly settling
into stride, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, kept on under a drive to secure
the show honors getting forced to take brief hold and pause nearing the finish as KINGDOM came outwards late. M B'S MUNNING coaxed from the start,
chased six then five wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. TOXIC GRAY
coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide down the backstretch and into the turn, began to tuck inwards with seven-sixteenths to go making his way
to the two path when placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, offered up a bid and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then weakened in the
drive. WHAT'S UP BRO stumbled at the start pecking the ground and conceded two to three lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased briefly
four to five paths off the inside before tipping seven to eight paths off the inside in the initial sixteenth of a mile, tucked six wide through the turn coming
under coaxing midway, went eight wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
A LISTER bumped solidly with a rival at the start, saved ground on the first turn, tracked the leader on the outside down the backstretch, made a bid near
the seven-sixteenths pole, vied in the three path on the far turn, took the lead in the four path into the stretch, shook clear into the final furlong then drifted
inward and held under steady urging. WITHIN VIEW settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, moved off the rail under a drive at the quarter-pole,
shifted out some more in the stretch and willingly earned the place. ISOMARSHALL moved in early, saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear,
was urged while moving from the rail to the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch, moved out some more in the drive and improved to just
get the show. AWESOME FORCE went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked on the far turn, lost the lead to the winner in the two path into
the stretch, lost touch with that foe into the final furlong and weakened then lost the show late. WAFLR angled in before the wire for the first time, went three
wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, traveled around the far turn in the two path and failed to impact. JANSSEN went three wide on the first turn,
settled just off the pace on the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch, was urged three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed response. TWO JAY'S WAY bumped solidly with a foe at the start then bobbled and was taken up, spotted the front a few lengths, saved
ground on the first turn, settled near the back, went two then three wide on the far turn and was no factor. IN MY SHADOW went three wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, negotiated some traffic while three then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MALIBU
MARGARITA was hustled from the gate, traveled around the opening bend in the two path, was urged along towards the back, raced in the two path on the
far turn and failed to respond then was transported off the track via equine ambulance. PERNO went five then four wide on the first turn, was urged along on
the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch, faltered in the four then five path on the far turn and was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

DONEGAL FOREVER went three then four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, ranged up four wide on the far turn, made a bid outside
the quarter-pole, took the lead while carried eight wide into upper stretch, fought outside of the runner-up to the finish and prevailed under steady urging.
POWER SEEKER went to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the first turn, showed the way inside of a rival early on the backstretch,
lost the lead outside the three-quarter pole, regained the advantage before the half-mile pole, was urged along while inside on the far turn, lost the
advantage again outside the five-sixteenths pole, fought on with good courage in the stretch and narrowly earned the place. PERFORM raced in the three
path on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, took a short lead outside the three-quarter pole, lost the advantage before the half-mile pole, was
urged three wide on the turn, regained the lead late on that bend, was headed while drifting seven wide into upper stretch, fought on well to the finish and
just missed the place while able to get the show. MISTICAL CURLIN was hustled from the gate then taken in hand, rounded the first turn in the two path,
was rated just off the pace, made a bid between horses outside the five-eighths pole, was asked in the two path while still between opponents on the final
turn, chased into the final furlong, kept on into the final sixteenth but was outfinished late. ARCHIE THE GIZA saved ground under restraint on the first turn,
tossed his head outside the three-quarter pole, was rated off the pace, chased in the two path on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch and came up
empty. DUKE OF GLOUCESTER was hustled from the gate, raced in the two path on the first turn, settled near the back, was urged along in the two path
on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ALTERNATE REALITY went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear on the
outside, was urged three then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

NEXT forwardly placed from the start, raced three paths off the inside past the stands the initial time before tucking to the two path through the first turn,
settled two to three wide in closest aim of the leader remaining patiently handled applying no pressure save through his presence to the outside, got given a
notch three wide midway on the far turn and advanced to take over command just outside the quarter pole, swung four then three wide straightened away
into upper stretch given a nudge by the rider, received a tap a furlong out to the right shoulder went clear under very light urging and prevailed comfortably
at the finish. CRUPI brushed the near side stall at the break, raced four to five paths off the rail through the stretch the first turn before tucking to the two
path through the first turn, tipped out four wide down the backstretch, came under coaxing four to five wide with seven-sixteenths to go and advanced
outside rivals before swinging seven wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while offering up a mild kick to secure the place honors in the
late stages. DRAKE'S PASSAGE established the front and showed the way just off the inside under a rating hold through sensible splits and under the
watchful eye of NEXT to the outside, was along the inside through the first turn before tipping back out to the two path down the backstretch, remained just
off the inside through the far turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths facing pressure for the initial time by the top one, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch displaced from the front, proved no match through the stretch while running on to the finish and was bested in the late going for the place
honors while well clear for the show. MASQUEPARADE four wide in the stretch the first turn, went three wide through the first turn, chased three to four
wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. DAI VERNON two to three wide early
on, chased two to three wide coming under prolonged coaxing from the half mile pole, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened.
SPENCER'S BOY LUNA three to four wide past the stands just after the start, tucked inside through the first turn, chased three wide down the backstretch
and through the far turn under coaxing from the half mile pole, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. LURE HIM IN stumbled at the start, recovered to
race forwardly placed just off the inside and then along the inside through the opening six furlongs, began to fade and continued along the inside through
the far turn given a nudge midway but not fully engaged by the rider while in retreat, swung four wide into upper stretch and faltered in the drive.

ISLAND FOX was well placed just off the pace on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, moved off the rail late on that bend, pursued the leader into
upper stretch, gained to make a bid near the eighth-pole, dueled outside the runner-up in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under strong urging.
SUMMER WHIRL went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was asked late on the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, swung out
into upper stretch, found her best stride in the final furlong and closed fast to just miss while up for the place. AUTUMN went to the front, showed the way on
the inside while in hand, was put to a drive in upper stretch, came under the crop near the eighth-pole, dueled inside of the winner in the final furlong and
missed while clear for the show. SHE'S A NATURAL saved ground on the first turn, settled on the inside, was roused early on the far turn, bumped with a
rival while trying to move out outside the five-sixteenths pole, shifted to the three path in the process, moved to the four path outside the quarter-pole, turned
into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick. BOBBY M'S GIRL raced in the three path on the first turn, settled off the pace, went three wide
early on the far turn, was bumped and forced to the four path near the five-sixteenths pole, moved to the five path outside the quarter-pole, brushed with an
opponent in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. ALITTLEBITNAUGHTY settled on the inside, moved out late on the far turn, came four wide into
the stretch, brushed with a rival inside the three-sixteenths pole and failed to rally. LADY LAOBAN went three then two wide on the first turn, tracked the
pace on the outside, dropped back two then three wide on the far turn and capitulated. DANCE ON AIR was taken in hand early, went four then three wide
on the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked late on the backstretch, traveled around most of the far turn in the two path then dropped to the rail and also
failed to rally. SAINTE CHAPELLE saved ground at the rear on the first turn, lagged at the back, went two then three wide on the far turn and was no factor.
ADDAGIRL ADDIE went around the first turn in the two path, settled near the back, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, moved out in upper
stretch and failed to threaten. LONCHURA went three to four wide on the turns, was urged on the final bend, came six wide into upper stretch and failed to
respond. SAVANNAH DANCER went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, continued to fall back in the
four then five path on the far turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.
