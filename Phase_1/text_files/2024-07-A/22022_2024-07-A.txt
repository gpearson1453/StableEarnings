Footnotes
C C SUNRISE broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide from between rivals
entering the final turn, took a narrow advantage into the lane, and inched clear in the drive. ANOTHERSUNNYDAY hopped at the start, but recovered
quickly and rushed four wide entering the first turn to gain a stalking trip entering the backside, advanced three wide midway down the backstretch to
challenge for the lead entering the final turn, was unable to match strides with C C SUNRISE entering the lane, but finished well one out from the rail late to
prove second best. TEXAS LEGACY away well and stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied one out from the
rail entering the final turn, and finished evenly four wide in the drive to garner a share. AMANDA away alertly and was allowed to settle off the early pace
while racing one out from the rail entering the backside, commenced her bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished with some late interest two wide
in the drive. WALKINTHEWALK unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, saved ground through the final turn, and finished with interest
four wide in the drive. ANIMA raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch, battled for the
lead from along the rail entering the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on the top pair leaving the turn, and weakened late.

Footnotes
AVANA settled at the back of the pack while shifting off the rail entering the stretch the first time, angled in towards to the rail to begin gaining on the leaders
entering the backstretch, continued to save ground through the final turn, overtook the pacesetter from along the rail entering the lane, and drew clear under
confident handling as much the best. VIVA LA DIVA away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace at the
rail through the second turn, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, drifted three wide entering the lane, and finished well to hold the place.
DONNA WYN broke sharply and was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, angled off the rail
for the run down the backside, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to garner a share. LONIE MO tracked the
pacesetter through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run to the final turn, rallied one out from the
rail through the turn, but weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
TEX HANLEY away well, and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, controlled the pace through the second turn and into the
backstretch, repelled early challenges in the run down the backside, opened a clear advantage through the final turn, and was never seriously threatened
late while under confident handling. READY HERO settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, was content to
bide his time off the leaders in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn while awaiting room, split horses leaving the turn, and
closed steadily in the lane to prove easily second best. PADDY D'ORO away alertly and tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing two out
from the rail, eased back into a stalking trip entering the second turn, commenced his bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished from along
the inside in the drive to garner a share. JOCK TALK unhurried early while trailing the field into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail,
advanced four wide soon after entering the backstretch to gain a striking position in the run to the final turn, continued five wide through the turn, and
finished four out from the rail in the drive while unable to make a serious late impact. YOU DON'T OWN ME broke sharply and tracked the leader into the
stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, pressed the pace two wide in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but
was outfinished late. VALUE MAX tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while hung four wide, moved up in the run down the backside to force the
issue, rallied four wide from between rivals through the final turn, checked sharply when put in tight quarters leaving the turn, and never fully recovered.

Footnotes
FAMILY BIZ settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, held a striking trip in the run down the backstretch,
rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly four out from the rail in deep stretch to get up in the closing strides to prevail. PARKER
POINT broke sharply and stalked the pacesetter through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, maintained his position in the run down the
backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to just miss. FRANKIE MACHINE settled
well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed
gamely two out from the rail in the drive to get up for a share. FORT LANGLEY away well, but was allowed to set off the early pace while racing three wide
into the stretch the first time, continued with a wide trip in the run down the backside, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly five out
from the rail in the drive. DYNAMITER away alertly and rushed to a clear lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, controlled the pace
through the second turn and in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside while maintaining the lead through the final turn, but faded in the drive.
MY COLLEGE FUND settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied smartly from along the inside, to loom
a danger entering the lane, but hung in the late stages. DEPUTY'S DANCER stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from
the rail, saved ground at the rail racing into the final turn, but weakened in the late going. TEXAS MOONSHINE tracked the leader through the stretch the
first time while racing one out from the rail, prompted the pace two wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.

Footnotes
AUGUST RAIN broke sharply and stalked the early pace from along the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down the
backside, launched his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed two wide from between rivals in deep stretch to get up in time. DIOCLES
settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly two out from the rail
in the drive to just miss. WESTMINSTER tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, pressed the pace two wide in
the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, took the narrowest of advantages into the lane, and gave way grudgingly late in a solid effort.
MONEYSHOT away alertly and took up sharply when squeezed between rivals approaching the first turn, worked his way into a stalking trip one out from
the rail in the run down the backside, battled for the lead from the outside of WESTMINSTER through the final turn, but was outfinished late. VECTOR away
well, and raced into a tracking trip while drifting out entering the first turn, maintained a striking position in the run down the backside and into the final turn,
but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. CLASSY CITY steadied slightly when put in tight quarters entering the first turn, held a stalking
trip while hung wide through the stretch the first time and in the run down the backside, carried on four wide into the final turn, but lacked the needed closing
response when called upon. SHOCK THE HOUSE raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, dictated the pace through the
second turn and in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. The stewards conducted
a review of the run to the first turn, which resulted in no action being taken.

Footnotes
BABY GRAND away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the
final turn, and had plenty left while drawing clear late to prove best. Baby Grand got loose following the race, and exited the track under his own power.
COUNTRY COWBOY broke sharply and tracked the leader into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn,
and closed two out from the rail in the drive to hold on for the place. SELF SERVING was off a step slow, but raced into a stalking trip two out from the rail
entering the backstretch, was bumped and jostled around while launched his bid entering the final turn, and finished willingly four wide in the drive to get up
for a share. RING OF KERRY away well and stalked the leader from along the rail entering the first turn, maintained his position in the run down the
backstretch, rallied along the inside through the final turn, and closed at the rail in the drive in an even effort. JUVEE TOO settled well off the early pace
while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, advanced from between rivals in the run to the final turn, while exchanging bumps, carried on
sharply three wide through the turn, but was outfinished late. EYE BE SEEING YOU settled off the early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch,
battled from the outside of rivals in the run to the final turn, while exchanging bumps, carried on three wide through the turn, but lacked the needed closing
response when called upon. VANCOUVER'S HUNTER unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back and never a factor, and was
ridden out past the wire.
