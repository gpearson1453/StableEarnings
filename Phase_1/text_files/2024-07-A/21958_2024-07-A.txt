SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE pursued the pacesetter then wore down that rival in the final furlong. SIR PALACE PRINCE set clear pace to midstretch, was
collared and continued gamely resisting the winner. HARRISON C chased off the pace inside and was no match for the top duo. BIAGIO rated off the pace
outside then flattened out in the stretch. WHOOSH trailed opening half mile then passed rivals while no factor. SOCIAL JOE dropped back early and lacked
a rally. PRINCE LUCAS saved ground well back and was always outrun. OMAHA EIGHT broke alertly then dropped back and faded inside. NOMAR'S

Footnotes
LORD KNOWS dueled inside, shook loose into the stretch and just lasted while tiring late. IRA THE ICON chased in midpack and closed strongly inside
through the stretch. HIGH STAKES settled outside the dueling leaders, bid into the stretch then flattened out. SMOKE WAGON moved boldly to contention
inside before half mile then tired late. C C GOLDRUSH pressed the winner to the final turn and weakened. CHECKITUP settled off the pace outside and
lacked a solid rally. TRAVEL GUIDE dropped far behind outside and was never a factor. TWIRLING EXPRESS was very fractious in the gate then broke
slowly and had no response. BOINTHEBACK dropped far behind and was always outrun. PRIVATE CABANA trailed early and was never involved.

ONE MORE SCOOP pursued the loose pacesetter inside, bid in the final furlong and prevailed in a game score. TWISTED RIDE moved close up from the
outset, rallied in the stretch and battled to the wire. SPIKEZONE quickly sprinted clear, was collared passing the eighth pole and tired. FAR MO POWER
lagged far behind then passed rivals without menacing. RIDIN WITH BIDEN dropped far behind and lacked a rally. COUNTERSPY angled inside early then
began fading on the turn. BUMP N RUN saved ground off the pace and gave way readily. ROCK ON LUKE stopped abruptly and was eased losing contact
with his field.

chased in midpack along the inside and gave way. KODAPENDENT trailed for half mile, moved wide and had no response. SAMARONTI dropped back
early, raced wide on the final turn and faltered. HURRICANE HIGHWAY lacked speed and weakened steadily. SMARTEN UP raced within range briefly
