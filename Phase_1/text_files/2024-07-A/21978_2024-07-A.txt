Footnotes
MANSOURA went to the front to set all the pace, fended off the challenge from SAM'S PROMISE on the final turn and edged away in early stretch to prove
best. MAGNA TAP walked out of the gate and spotted the field several lengths at the start then steadily advanced through the final turn, angled out to three
wide at the eighth pole for the late kick to be up for the place. SAM'S PROMISE pressed the pace from two wide to the top of the stretch and was empty and
couldn't save the place. BLESSED VISION was slightly unsettled in the gate prior to the start, then raced off the pace down the backstretch then moved up
from three wide on the final turn but lacked the late response. COUNTY JUDGE was rank around the first turn then allowed to settle down the backstretch
but was never a factor. GO BROTHER GO raced five wide on the first turn then raced four wide on the backstretch but was not a threat.

INSPECTOR PENNY pressed the pace from two wide then took command at the quarter pole and drew clear. HONDURAS PASSION raced off the pace
but had to steady at the half mile marker and lost action, then made a three wide rebid for the rally to be second best. ON THE MONEY LUV sprinted to a
clear lead to midway through the turn, was overtaken at the quarter pole and weakened late. KERRIGAN'S TOUCH raced off the pace to the turn then made
a mild two wide bid on the turn but was empty in the stretch. COWGIRL QUEEN trailed the field and gained experience. TEKANA was unsettled in the gate
and had an awkward start, rushed up the rail to be in contention to the turn but failed to sustain the bid and faded.

Footnotes
WILLAMINA was void of the early speed and was coaxed at the half mile marker going four wide around the turn to sail past the leaders and cruised home.
NATURAL TOUCH raced off the pace from off the rail down the backstretch then slipped up the rail going into the stretch and proved to be second best.
SHEZA CAT was tardy at the start then rushed to contention from three wide and kept moving forward through the turn but was outfinished late. CHOCTAW
BLESSINGS rushed to a clear lead but was collared at the quarter pole and tired. K J'S PISTOL ANNIE chased the leader and was outrun. JANIS trailed the
field, distanced, eased and walked off.
