Footnotes
ROLLING ALONG had a nice set up, rating kindly in hand nestled all alone behind the engaged pair along the backside, waited patiently measuring the
contesting duo midturn, burst between rivals in the two path when the seam opened up straightening for the drive and pulled away powerfully in the final
furlong for a dominant win. MY VOODOO DOLL seized control from the start, was hounded outside down the backstretch, dictated the pace while
shadowed outside throughout the turn, put away the early speed foe at the top of the lane, could not find more in reserve to fend off the winner who had an
ideal trip and easily bested the rest for the runners up share. BACKONTHECHAINGANG prompted the pace outside down the back straight, continued to
hound the pacesetter outside around the turn, gave way to the front two three wide at the top of the stretch and showed some grit to stay on to save third
place. BEE ME had a stalking position on the rail to begin, took closer order inside heading into the turn, made little headway around the bend and was
gaining with each stride late for the show prize but just missed at the wire. IRISH RAIDER stalked the pace outside along the backstretch, lost ground to the
leaders while skimming the rail throughout the turn and could not be a factor running down the lane. ALPHA MEISTER was left at the start, spotting the field
some lengths to begin, finally caught up to a rival outside at the quarter pole but had nothing left to offer in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
BLAMELESS GHOST patiently watched the contesting duo outside down the backstretch, cruised up three wide outside to apply pressure inside the half
mile marker, bid for the lead outside entering the stretch and wore down the game frontrunner at the sixteenth pole. MIRAMICHI had a slim lead on the rail
down the back straight, continued to lead while hounded outside by two runners throughout the turn, was headed outside by the winner at the top of the
stretch, stubbornly dug in until the sixteenth pole and grudgingly gave way late. FRIENDS FOR LIFE travelled on the outside in mid-division down the
backside, watched the front trio outside around the turn, swung out to the five path straightening for home and fought on down the lane to win the show
battle right at the wire. SHAMELESS AFFAIR settled in midfield on the inside down the backstretch, tracked boldly in the second flight through the turn,
shifted outside for clear run to loom in the four path turning for home, veered in at the top of the lane losing some momentum briefly, could not reel in the
front two down the stretch and was out finished late battling for the show award. CLARAYOUTHEBEST was unhurried to trail in the beginning, made little
progression around the turn and showed some run to pass weary foes in mid-stretch. FLIP FLOPPIN FAST stalked three deep on the outside down the
backside, sat alone in the third flight making little headway around the bend and failed to reach contention driving the finish line. BRITISH CROWN contest
the pace outside in the early stages, was scrubbed on for more between rivals but could not maintain position in the two path at the five sixteenths pole, had
little left to offer and yielded in upper stretch. SPIRIT BEAR stalked near the rear with rivals on either side, was taken hold of when taking some awkward
steps on the fence inside the nine sixteenths marker, lost action for a while and never factored afterwards.

Footnotes
SOUPER SUPREME took control from the onset, was unchallenged setting a comfortable fraction down the backside, galloped along with no pressure
applied through the bend and when set down in mid-stretch with just a move of the riders hands held safe easily to the finish line. TOP OF D MOUNTAIN
tracked the frontrunner winner three wide between foes in the backstretch, fought determinedly with horses on both sides while trying to reel in the leader in
the turn, finished up through the lane on the wrong lead but still won the place award regardless. J M R TACITA chased on the rail down the backstretch,
dueled for the secondary spot inside throughout the turn, continued to battle for the place share in the stretch but gave way by the sixteenth pole.
PICKFORD SWEET had a stalking position outside horses down the backstraight, was roused for more behind the threesome that was trying to close in on
the leader through the turn, shifted out to the four path for the drive, dove inside to the rail by the furlong marker and stalled on the fence in deep stretch for
a minor share. PEACE POSEY stalked on the rail in the early going, could not quicken with others making a move at the three eighths pole and passed a
weary foe through the lane. STORMY RALEIGH tracked the frontrunner four deep along the backside, was four wide chasing the pacesetter around the
bend, began to give way to inside rivals at the quarter pole and faded through the stretch. PRINCESS ROSINA dwelt on the start, spotting the field by many
down the backside and could not overcome the poor break to be a factor.

Footnotes
GILT EDGE was taken hold of and eased back off the leaders in the early going, stalked going two to three wide mid-pack into the turn, came out five wide
turning for home, struck the lead at the three-sixteenths, moved clear then held under mild urging. RAPID GREY switched out off the rail settling near the
back, went two wide on the turn, came out a bit further in upper stretch and rallied mildly between foes but was no match for the winner. PHILLIP MY WINE
settled at the back outside, swung eight wide, gained show. BANKINGONAMIRACLE broke sharply and was quickly clear, set the pace near the inside,
weakened in the stretch. BORROWED BANDIT broke a step slowly and lost the path at the start, settled at the back, raced off of the rail coming into upper
stretch, gained mildly late. BEYOND ADVERSITY settled outside off the pace racing three to four wide through the turn, angled seven deep coming to the
top of the stretch, was never near enough to threaten. AWMIK SIDE OF TOWN shifted in, saved ground to no avail. BOURBON NORTH broke outwardly,
stalked the leader, ranged up alongside making a bid past the five-sixteenths, faltered in upper stretch. SUMMER BUCK was fractious in the gate then
forwardly-positioned stalking four wide, floated six wide turning for home, came up empty.

Footnotes
MISTY POINT prompted the pace inside early on, was smartly reined back off the contesting duo to sit behind the leaders at the half, waited for her cue,
nestled in on the rail around the turn, shifted out three wide in upper stretch for a clear path and was full of run, extending her stride in deep stretch to go on
for the score under patient handling. HYPER ANGEL had a slight lead inside down the backstretch, set the pace while pressured outside by a rival around
the bend, stubbornly dug in on the fence down the stretch but just could not hold off the winner who had an ideal trip. ZIPPY GAMBLE pressed the pace
outside in the beginning, continued to hound the frontrunner outside throughout the turn, bid for the lead three wide at the top of the lane, could not find
more late and faded at the seventy yard pole to be a clear third. DANCIN MARY MARIE broke slowly on the start, settled in the third flight by herself down
the back straight, started to rally at the quarter pole and finished strong through the lane covering ground impressively in deep stretch. NO MALARKEY
tracked in the two path outside by the half mile marker, was roused outside at the quarter pole but could not close the gap on the leaders and prevailed
outside winning the battle for the minors. SCARY SPEEDY was away slowly to begin, then was hustled to get a better forward position inside down the
backstretch, sat just a couple of lengths behind the lead pair on the fence by the half, sat in the third flight alone making no progress around the bend and
was one paced on the rail dueling for a small piece of the prize. ELLA IT IS trailed the field at the half, continued at the rear through the turn and passed a
tired foe in the stretch. BLAZE OF MISCHIEF stalked near the rear having one foe beaten in the early going, saved ground but made little impression
around the bend and had no presence running inside down the lane.

Footnotes
CAITLINHERGRTNESS got away well, was taken in hand rating in behind the pacesetter, angled three wide at the top of the stretch for room and with aim,
took the lead just past the eighth pole, drew clear. SHE MAKES A POINT settled off the pace inside mid-pack, came out for the stretch, rallied between foes
to just get up for place. VEERY sped clear pulling against the rider's grasp a bit entering the first turn while shifting in to the two to three path, set the tempo
up the backstretch leading them into upper stretch, was overtaken by the winner in mid-stretch but kept on to the wire narrowly losing a photo for second. MI
CORAZON was up close stalking from outside three to four wide, fanned out a bit further turning for home, kept on late but needed more. COZY CURLIN
KITTEN stalked mid-pack between runners to the far turn, advanced in behind runners in the stretch but steadied when in tight nearing the wire. KITTEN'S
ROMANCE was between foes into the first turn, continued inside a rival well back off the pace near the rail, was never near enough to threaten. BIJOU
BABY unhurriedly brought up the rear, swung five wide turning for home, was not a threat. GIZMO'S B F F stalked from outside mid-pack four to five wide,
dropped back three to four wide on the far turn and faded. FAITHFUL CREEK was caught outside three to four wide on the first turn racing off the pace,
continued toward the back into the far turn, shifted in late on that bend, was not a factor.

Footnotes
QUEEN MACHA was unhurried down the backstretch, having only one horse beaten, sensing the quick pace up front, continue to just galloped along seeing
the field in the turn, started to sharply move past runners outside with five sixteenths to run, shifted out six wide with a full head of steam and finished up
strongly late to have her head in front when crossing the line. SARATOGA VISION was allowed to settle, trailing by many along the backside, began to
uncork a strong rally going past foes outside at the quarter pole, swung out widest with momentum in the seven path at the top of the lane and under left
handed encouragement closed fast to get up at the wire for second money. ENGLISH SHIRL angled in on the start when hustled, clearing to the lead on the
rail by the half, dueled inside when headed at the three furlong pole, determinedly dug in at the furlong marker, resurged to lead again at the sixteenth pole,
drifted out some driving to the wire in the final seventy yards but could not fend off the closing rivals at the finish line. BLIND SPOT picked up the bit after the
start to prompt outside under a snug hold at the half, bid for the lead outside three furlongs out, poked her head in front in mid-stretch, dueled to the wire,
could not find more late and weakened seventy yards from the line for a minor share in the end. AHA MOMENT pressed inside early on, was then taken a
hold off to track on the fence at the half, kept pace with the leaders, saving ground around the turn, was in the mix for a share inside at the eighth pole but
tired with a sixteenth remaining. SIX SENSE tracked in the two path between for at the half, was looking for running room behind the engaged leaders at the
quarter pole, was stymied behind the tiring leaders at the eighth pole, shifted outside to briefly have a clear lane, lost her path by the seventy yard marker
and could not get into gear late. FLYING BLACK stalked near the rear down the backside, made little improvement in the third flight on the rail around the
turn, was in the three path behind the dueling leaders straightening out for the drive, lost her lane at the furlong marker and galloped in afterwards to the
wire. LADY ONYX (IRE) broke just a step slow on the start, travelled three deep outside horses down the backside in the third flight, edged closer three
wide around the bend, had a chance for a piece of the prize when in range in the five path turning for home but stalled at the furlong marker with rivals on
both sides. SILKEN DOLLAR broke out slightly to start, was checked leaving the chute, recovered to watch the engaged pair on the lead three wide at the
half, closed in when nudged three wide outside with five sixteenths from home, was in the thick of things in the four path at the top of the lane but yielded
between rivals at the sixteenth pole. EFFICACIOUS settled in midfield outside foes along the backstretch, was hard ridden going the wrong way by midturn
and emptied out in upper stretch. STEWRADS INQUIRY REGARDING THE START CONCERNING #11 ENGLISH SHIRL RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

Footnotes
GAL IN A RUSH bumped a rival lightly a few strides after the break, was reserved at the back, swung eight wide turning for home, rallied in the middle of the
track to take charge seventy yards out and driving clear. OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE got away well and was quickly clear, set the pace kept wide early, shifted
in up the backstretch but dictating terms just off the fence, was prompted by an outside foe near the seven-sixteenths, retook command to move clear again
late on the turn, was no match for the winner but kept on well to be second best. PLAY THE MUSIC moved forward outside four wide heading to the
seven-sixteenths, continued to stalk from outside, moved out five to six deep for the stretch run, kept on well late but missed second and just saved show.
AWESOME TREAT settled mid-division, saved ground inside through the turn, kept on in the stretch. HONEY PANTS exchanged a light bump at the start,
pursued from outside going five wide on the turn, was a bit wider in the stretch, kept on but was not enough. FREEDOM SPEAKS was lightly bumped at the
start, chased from between runners mid-pack two to three wide on the turn, came out five wide in upper stretch then altered out further late for room,
needed more. MARISSA'S LADY made an early move between runners three wide to briefly put a nose in front near the seven-sixteenths, continued to
chase after having forced the pace, faltered and faded. TEQUILERA settled off the pace outside, fanned seven wide into upper stretch, failed to menace.
UNIFYING exchanged minor contact at the start, was outside at the back throughout, fanned nine wide, failed to menace.

Footnotes
BORDER TOWN took control right from the start, cleared to the rail setting a comfortable first quarter for these kind down the backstretch, alone up top, was
unchallenged dictating terms around the bend, was long gone, moving well at the furlong pole and cruised home for the front end score. MASON'S
GAMBLE tracked outside in the early going, chased the pacesetter between rivals in the turn and stubbornly finished up with purpose down the stretch to
hold for second money at the wire. LAST AMERICAN EXIT stalked inside down the backstretch, running in hand, waited inside, keeping pace with the
leader around the turn, shifted outside to the four path for the stretch drive, battled for the runners up share but just missed closing in late. RONDURE
stalked three deep outside foes in the beginning, offered a good turn of foot three wide outside horses in midturn, dueled in the three path outside rivals for
the place share in the stretch, could not find more late and stalled at the furlong marker. ROARING FORTIES trailed this compact, bunched up field early
on, shifted three wide outside midway on the turn, offered little rally, was fanned out widest in the five path for the drive but lacked a bid down the lane.
ARMSTRONG tracked on the rail down the backstretch, chased inside throughout the turn, was urged left handed in upper stretch dueling for the runners up
share but flattened out inside at the seventy yard marker.

Footnotes
KATHERINE'S GEM prompted the pace at the start, was throttled down the track the contesting pair down the backside, was all alone in third, liking what
they see watching the front pair go at it around the bend, pounced to the leaders in the six path in upper stretch and under mild urging pulled away the last
sixteenth for the win. JUST ON TIME had the lead while hounded outside down the back straight, continued to duel upfront inside throughout the turn, put
away the speed rival in upper stretch, valiantly battled inside with the winner down the lane but gave way late, saving the runner up share at the wire.
HYPER AWAKENING stalked close to the back of the pack outside rivals down the backside, settled in mid-division through the turn three wide outside
foes, angled out widest in the eight path straightening out for home and with a strong late surge, closed well to just miss getting the photo for place money.
SECRET GIZMO settled in midfield on the rail, began to inch closer, taking the shortest way around the turn, skimmed the fence in with a chance for a share
of the prize straightening for home and willingly closed in to be a fringe player at the finish line. FEDALINE sat just behind the eventual winner down the
backside being forwardly placed, ran on evenly around the turn, was in the six path behind the leader at the top of the lane, stayed on her wrong lead until
deep stretch and was just nosed out for a minor role in the end. GUNNAWIN settled on the rail near the rear down the back straight, made little impact
saving ground around the bend, was in the five path for the drive behind horses and showed good late energy in the final sixteenth outside horses.
MAKAYLA travelled outside horses three wide in the third flight around the turn, angled out with rivals on both sides in the seven path for the stretch drive
and finished up evenly down the lane. P. S. RISING STAR broke out, trailing at the start, made no impression near the rear through the bend and could not
get involved in the drive to the wire. I'M A BOURBON GIRL stalked between rivals in mid-pack through the turn, was in range in the two path fighting for a
small share turning for home, could not go and faltered at the furlong marker. BEQUIA was ahead of one rival early on, could see the field when not
interested running around the turn and could only pass a struggling rival in the stretch. PROUD SPEAKER pressed the issue outside down the backstretch,
dueled for the front still forcing the pace outside around the bend, shifted to the four path between rivals at the top of the stretch, had little left to offer and
folded by the furlong marker.
