Footnotes
SILVER PONZI away in good order, narrowly showed the way under the wire the first time, continued to duel onto and up the the backstretch, shook off the
other speed turning for home, and coasted in as clearly best. RONALD DALE last to leave, continued devoid of any early speed, made a late run up the rail
to be in time for the place. ROBERT WHO also broke well, dueled outside the winner for just over a half, first to blink, continued to weaken through the lane,
caught late for the place. DOCS CARO CAT one paced throughout, lacked a rally. FIRE EXTINGUISHER settled off the pace and the inside, lacked a
response when called on for the drive. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most
accurate time.

Footnotes
DUANES SONNEY BOY broke sharp, set a pressured pace toward but not on the inside, larger advantage far turn, pulled away through the lane while
being kept to pressure. GOSPEL FOREST also broke alertly, dueled outside the winner early, pressed that rival the middle three furlongs, proved no match
through the stretch, determined for the second spot. ARCH OF SWORDS settled off the pace while saving ground, continued in the second flight, closer late
in the final turn, in a bit tight along the rail into the stretch, could not do much with the winner when clear to the wire, outkicked for the place. ABES DAY void
of speed, four wide turning into the stretch, displayed a mild amount of late interest to improve position slightly. TIZNOWS GRANDSON in the second flight
while three wide and out in the strip, asked along into the lane, weakened through the stretch. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
BORN TOUGH broke in, saved ground to no avail in lacking a closing bid. JEANO vied early inside the winner into the first turn, pressed that one in the run
up the backstretch, continued to apply pressure far turn, held on stubbornly in the drive, clearly second best. GOSPEL DANDY with the pace from the start,
vied in the two path into the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch, gained a slightly larger advantage turning for home, ran on well to edge clear in
the late going. CLEARLY A JET within striking distance while four wide into the first turn, continued outside, proved no match for the top pair while once
again four wide through the second bend. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most
accurate time.

STORMY BISONETTE broke on top, set the pace along the inside, rated backstretch, cruised home without being asked for his all as much the best.
LENA'S SHADOW in the second flight inside, continued to chase the middle part, proved no match through the lane, held sway for the place. POLLY TIZ
forwardly placed early while outside, continued three wide onto the backstretch, lacked a response in the drive to finish best of the other two. EXCETERA
settled off the pace while racing outside, lacked a response through the lane. RIVER LIBERTY fell back to trail after the start and was never involved. This
race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
COLE TRICKLE unhurried in trailing early along the inside, moved closer before a half, steadied midway up the backstretch, advanced on the leader and
challenged outside that one into the far turn, wore that rival down through the stretch to be edging clear at the end. CLINTON QUARINTINO within striking
distance three wide, crept closer 3w 2nd turn, took over, responded when confronted by the winner into the far turn, gave ground grudgingly to that one
through the stretch, clearly second best. WHAT ABOUT JIMMY narrowly showed the way first turn, continued to set the pace the opening half, relinquished
the advantage to the runner up late backstretch and began to gradually weaken after being headed. BERRYVILLE BULLET forwardly placed early, fell back
after a half, failed to respond when called on for the drive. C J'S LEGACY four wide through the first turn, remained outside to once again be four wide
through the second bend, failed to rally. GOSPEL CRUSADER pressured the pace four furlongs, gave way, finished up well back. This race had a timing
discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
MS. HILLARY broke on top, narrowly set the early pace inside, expanded that advantage just before a quarter, continued to show the way through the final
turn in the two path, turned back a rival entering the stretch to be clear again at the end. GOSPEL SPEAR off a step slow, raced back early, closer before a
half, pursued winner, brief rail bid into lane, bit tight, denied, far clear of the others. PRINCESS BALL prompted the winner four four furlongs, had little left for
the drive. SECRET PASS went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. GOSPEL FAITH fell back to trail before a quarter and was never a
factor. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
LOW EURO CAT broke on top, showed the way early on his own courage, rated in the run up the backstretch, drew out steadily the final quarter to win as
the rider pleased. GOSPEL CHARITY broke with the winner, pressed that one from off the inside and between horses early, continued to race closest to
that rival the middle three furlongs, no match in the drive, remained clear for the place. CATALE WINEMIXER last to leave, trailed for four furlongs, along for
the show, no threat to the top two. HANGXIETY turned in an even effort while racing toward the inside, failed to muster a response when called for turning
for home. SHAWK'S LIL MIA fractious in the gate, broke with the field, pressed the issue up front three wide early, began a steady fade before a half. This
race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
HUNTER QUICK away best of all, showed the way into the first turn inside, continued to set a pressured pace while saving ground the middle half, shook
clear far turn and maintained a clear advantage to the wire under steady handling. STOCKPILER void of early foot outside, continued to lack speed,
launched a four wide rally turning for home, finished up willingly to be up late for the place. UNITED PATRIOT moved closer three wide past the wire the first
time, continued to prompt the issue up the backstretch, fell back off the winner early in the third turn, part of a busy second flight through the lane, caught
late for the place. WILBERT pressed the issue from between foes, continued to vie through the second turn and the early part of the second trip up the
backstretch, fell back far turn and continued to weaken to the wire. MAJOR CONTENDER settled behind the three horse first flight for six furlongs, roused
far turn, managed little in the way of a response. WAVERUNNER broke back, continued to lack speed and was finished after a half. This race had a timing
discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
