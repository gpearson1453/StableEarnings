Footnotes
SERENDIP RULER broke sharp, soon got clear out of the chute, continued to maintain a daylight advantage into and through the turn toward the inside,
enough left in the late going to hold the runner up safe. WRANGLERED broke just behind the winner, dueled in the second flight chasing that one, lost some
ground to that same rival with a three wide trip through the turn, closing the gap in the closing strides while too late. REVEREND AJ in the second flight
while outside the runner up, hung four wide through the turn, had nothing for the top pair through the stretch, remained well clear of the others. ROBERT
WHO saved ground to no avail as he had little for the drive. TAP N PLAY back off the early pace inside, moved off the inside, was finished before three
furlongs. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

LOOKIN LUCKY AGAIN unhurried in the early going while a bit slow to settle along the inside, began to advance before a half, collared the leader far turn,
quickly took over soon after and kicked well clear through the stretch under steady handling. IMPUDENT cleared to the inside soon after the start, dueled
the opening half while remaining closest to the rail, shook clear of the other speed with a quarter to run, offered little resistance to the winner in the second
turn, comfortably saved the place. SCANDALOUS settled off the pace, continued in even fashion in lacking a closing response. CHEEKY KISS fell back to
trail after a quarter, continued a steady retreat and finished far back. GOSPEL GORGEOUS moved up to duel after the start, alternated in the two path the
middle half mile, gave way late backstretch, pulled up midway on the final turn, transported off of the track via equine ambulance. This race had a timing
discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

OLD TOBY broke on top, flashed brief speed out of the chute, fell back, went one paced throughout. IMPOVERISHED vied early, allowed the winner to go
into the turn, chased that one along the inside, through the turn and into the stretch, could not get to that one the final sixteenth. SCRIMSHIRE off a beat
slow, was strongly urged under a left handed crop to join the leaders the opening furlong, continued under stout pressure to clear late backstretch,
maintained a daylight advantage through the lane to hold sway at the end. OLD SEVENTEEN was always outrun while racing well out in the strip, well
beaten. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

CAPTAIN DOZER asked early to maintain inside position, edged clear just before a quarter, continued to show the way up the backstretch along the inside,
confronted then was headed by the runner up turning for home, regained the advantage and found more late to prevail in a determined effort. WON NINETY
pulled early while rating behind the pace while saving ground, began a steady advance after three furlongs, collared the winner from the outside late in the
final turn, put a head in front entering the stretch then dueled to the wire only to be outfinished. LANGMEAD settled in mid pack while off the inside, dropped
to the rail late in the second turn, lacked a closing response. JEANO fell back steadily to trail before a quarter and was never involved. MR SEEKER chased
the winner from the outside for over a half, had little left for the stretch run. ALWAYS A KING four wide in the first turn when forwardly placed, remained
within striking distance the middle quarter, dropped to the inside turning for home, improved position slightly without posing a serious threat. CLEARLY A
JET last to leave, raced off the pace while outside, moved closer turning for home, failed to sustain that advance in the run to the wire to finish up best of the
rest. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

APRIATI unhurried early inside, moved out before commencing her rally midway on the turn, three wide for the drive, closed with a rush to be up in time
while widest of the first flight at the wire. CAMS HOTROD void of speed, saved ground through the turn, rallied furiously up the rail to finish well only to just
miss. TUATHA hustled early from between horses to show the way out of the chute, was given a slight breather in the turn, continued to be clear into the
lane, nailed in the final strides from the top two from both sides to miss. TRIBAL QUEEN bobbled slightly at the break, recovered to press the leader from
the outside, had little left for the final sixteenth to also lose a couple of positions. HUSHED broke sharp, fell back the opening furlong, continued to fade to
trail home. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

FRIGERATOR away well, cleared to the inside to set the pace, continued to show the way inside, not seriously threatened through the stretch under steady
handling. BRICKTOWN BROWN broke with the winner despite being brushed from the inside, vied inside that same rival into the first turn, chased up the
backstretch and into the far turn, could do little with that same rival down the lane while holding sway for the place. TWENTY TO PARK within striking
distance while outside the top two, shifted out a bit wider for the drive, went evenly late to be outkicked for the place. KISSOFTHENILE restless in the gate,
in tight at the start, forwardly placed early, fell back a bit the middle half then managed some mild late gain while not a serious threat. STORMS LAST
restless in the gate, also was in tight at the break, altered course to be wide into the first turn, remained back. HYPERION NORTH broke out to tighten up a
couple of outer rivals, raced inside past the wire the first time, lost action along the rail soon after, moved outside, went flat through the stretch. This race
had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

STARBURST took control soon after the start, cleared before a quarter, lightly rated in the run up the backstretch, cruised home while steadily increasing his
advantage under mild encouragement. SHADOWLESS in the second flight early, settled the middle three furlongs, rallied for the place down the lane while
proving no threat to the winner. NOISE COMPLAINT dueled early outside the winner, chased up the backstretch and into the far turn, proved no match in
the drive, caught for the place. HOODOO BROWN remained back in making little in the way of an impact. ONE SON OF A CHIEF in the second flight while
racing outside, failed to muster a response in the drive. BONES BRUIN dwelt at the start, trailed throughout and was never a factor. This race had a timing
discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

STRIKETHREEYOUROUT broke running, set a clear pace along the inside, responded when the runner up came calling turning back for home, turned that
rival back and once again regained a daylight advantage to the wire. MAUI MISTRESS prompted the winner off the inside into the first turn, continued
closest to that one up the backstretch, ranged up to challenge in the two path turning into the stretch, was denied when straightened for home, clearly
second best. CLAY'S RUBY LOVE chased the top two throughout while out in the strip, had little in the way of a closing response in the drive, remained
clear of the others. DIAMOND GAL settled off the pace and the inside, roused in the run up the backstretch, failed to significantly respond to finish up
evenly. SUGAR COATED bobbled at the start, was quickly righted to raced four wide into the first turn when back off the pace, continued to lack speed then
failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. APPLE SEED last away, trailed throughout to be always outrun. This race had a timing discrepancy or
malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
