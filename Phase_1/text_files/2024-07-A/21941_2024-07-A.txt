Footnotes
LITTLE Z was void of early speed and trailed the field down the backstretch then circled the field in early stretch for the late rally and was up in the final
jumps. SHEZA SALTY GAL rushed up from five wide and kept moving up on the turn to take the lead into the stretch then drew clear but was nipped at the
wire. MY IDEA vied for the lead from three wide to the three furlong marker but faded on the turn and made a rebid in the stretch to be best of the rest. MO
DIXIE DIVA was hustled along from four wide to be off the pace to the top of the stretch but lacked the late response needed. RUN AWAY SAMARI broke in
and bumped with TENSAS CLEAR leaving the gate, then sprinted away to the lead from two wide then edged away on the turn but was collared at the
quarter pole and tired. TENSAS CLEAR bumped with RUN AWAY SAMARI leaving the gate but kept on to press the pace from the inside to the turn and
dropped back.

Footnotes
JULIA'S WARRIOR vied for the lead in the three path down the back stretch, took an outside path around their foes on the turn to eventually take the lead
just before the quarter pole to secure the win. AROLLERCOASTERRIDE pressed the pace to the quarter pole from two wide then coming down the stretch
angled out at the eighth pole and was second best. TEXAS TURBINE stalked the pace from mid pack then moved between horse at the seven sixteenth
pole and coming out of the turn took to the outside and had a late rally at the three sixteenths pole to be up for show. CABRO TORO had good early speed
to take the lead with a pressure pace until the quarter pole but tired coming down the stretch. DEEP STATE had a good early bid while saving ground to no
avail. FABLED RULER trailed the pack early, then had a mild late interest down the stretch.

Footnotes
HEXCEL was well placed off the rail to stalk the leader through the final turn then was asked at the quarter pole and ran down the leader in deep stretch to
be up in the final jumps. BRONTE DIEM went to the an unchallenged lead to set all the pace but was caught in deep stretch to be second best. MALIBU
MONEY chased the leaders from off the pace and was no match for the top two and proved best of the rest. CHIEF HARLAN raced in the middle of the
pack around the first turn then steadily advanced through the final turn but failed to sustain the bid. ZONG'S FAVOR broke through the gate prior to the start
then settled in the middle of the pack and passed tiring rivals. NOT LIKELY raced near the back while saving ground and made a mild two wide stretch bid
but was never a factor. WHISKEY WITH YOU was forwardly placed to the three furlong marker and weakened. SWEET PRESENT was unhurried down the
backstretch then made a mild four wide bid on the final turn but was not a threat. MR LEO AND JOSE was always back.

FITTS N STARTS tracked the leaders from three wide at the three quarter pole and moved up to engage the leader on the final turn to take command at the
top of the stretch and was kept to task in the drive. I DONT KNOW EITHER saved ground while racing in the middle of the pack then made a rail bid at the
half mile marker and moved between horses midway through the final turn but couldn't catch the leader and proved second best. MOR KISSES raced in the
middle of the pack down the backstretch then moved up from two to four wide to the top of the stretch and flattened out. MARILYN'S MAGIC was unhurried
down the backstretch then made a mild bid on the final turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. NICELY UNIFIED pressed the pace from two wide around
the first turn then took the lead at the half mile marker but was challenged around the final turn by outside rival and tired at the top of the stretch. C C'S
COWGIRL was always back. SHE'S STORMING rushed to a pressured lead around the first turn then vied for the lead to midway through the final turn and
was done, distanced, eased.

SPARKIN tracked the leader down the backstretch then moved up from two wide to engage the leader and took the lead at the eighth pole and held on for
the win. LE MONSTRE RAPIDE sprinted to a clear lead to the quarter pole then was headed at the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. FAST VERDICT
was forwardly placed down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the turn for the late gain in the stretch. WESTERN STAR raced in the middle of
the pack to the final turn then saved ground to the top of the stretch and made a late two wide bid to improve position. J B GRAY bumped with SLEW CITY
HENRY leaving the starting gate then went five wide into the first turn, raced near the back down the backstretch and moved up from two wide on the final
turn to show the late interest but was outfinished. ITELLYOUTHEFACTS stalked the pace around the first turn from the inside then made a mild middle
move on the backstretch but retreated on the final turn. SLEW CITY HENRY bumped with J B GRAY leaving the starting gate then lugged out on the first
turn to trail the field and was outrun.

Footnotes
CHI TOWN HUSTLER went to the front to set an unchallenged pace from three to six wide, drew clear and proved best. D TWO raced in the middle of the
pack, made a two wide bid on the turn and tipped out to three wide in upper stretch but was no match for the winner. GOLDEN QUALITY raced four wide
and made a late stretch bid to be up for the show. FORTY THREE raced in the middle of the pack from the inside and made a mild bid to the turn but
flattened out. LIL WOADIE raced in the middle of the pack from three wide on the backstretch then tucked to the inside around the turn but failed to menace.
JACK BOB AND LARRY chased the leader down the backstretch and saved ground around the turn but gave way in the stretch. DOUBLE TRAP showed
little.
