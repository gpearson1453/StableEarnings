NU SOUP FOR BABY away alertly and raced to a narrow advantage from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace in the run down the
backside, repelled a bid by BORROWED EQUITY through the final turn, and drew clear late to prove best. SHOWMAN broke sharply and pressed the
leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, struggled to keep tabs on his pace rival entering the final turn, and faded over the final furlong.
RAILWAY POLICE tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, commenced his bid from along the inside entering the final
turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in the drive to get up for the place. BE SPARKY away well and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while
racing three wide from between rivals, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. BORROWED
EQUITY tracked the pacesetters four wide entering the backstretch, advanced three wide midway down the backside to force the issue two out from the rail
entering the final turn, but was outfinished in the drive while proving easily best of the rest.

LUCKY COWBOY broke sharply and stalked the dueling leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, launched his bid three
wide entering the final turn, swept to the lead entering the lane, and inched clear late. SOMTHING ELUSIVE settled at the back of the pack while racing two
out from the rail entering the backside, commenced his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed determinedly four wide in the drive to
prove clearly second best. DEPUTY'S DANCER away well and dueled for the lead from the outside of LEFT THE BAR in the run down the backside, took
command entering the final turn, was overtaken leaving the turn, and was outfinished late while holding on for a share. WICKED NIGHT settled off the early
pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response
when called upon. LEFT THE BAR away alertly and set a pressured pace from the inside of DEPUTY'S DANCER in the run down the backside, was unable
to match strides with his pace rival entering the final turn, and faded in the late going.

WHAT'S SHAKIN unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn and closed determinedly two
out from the rail in the drive to get up in the closing strides. RHUMBABA away alertly and raced to the lead one out from the rail entering the backstretch,
controlled the pace in the run down the backside, opened a clear advantage through the final turn, and just failed to last while proving clearly second best.
STATION ONE away well and stalked the pacesetter into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, shied from the outside presence of BOBBY ROCK
midway down the backstretch and dropped back to trail, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed willingly one out from the rail
in the drive to garner a share. BOBBY ROCK stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the
inside entering the final turn, but failed to sustain his bid in the stretch drive. HIGHLINER broke sharply and tracked the leader into the first turn while drifting
four wide, continued with a wide trip down the backstretch, dropped back to trail through the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.

Footnotes
PERFECT PENNY tracked the dueling leaders entering the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, set sail after the pacesetters two wide entering
the final turn, tipped three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly two out from the rail in the drive to prove best. DRILL BABY DRILL broke sharply
and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from the inside of B C CHRISTIE in the run down the backside and
through the final turn, was unable to fend off PERFECT PENNY in deep stretch, but inched clear from her pace rival in deep stretch to prove second best. B
C CHRISTIE away well and dueled for the lead two wide in the run down the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide through the final turn and
between rivals into the lane, but was outfinished in deep stretch while proving clearly best of the rest. VISENYA away alertly and stalked the leaders into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished evenly from along the rail in the drive. STRIKING
VALUE settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the
needed closing response when called upon. FEISTY ELLA settled at the back of the pack while racing three wide entering the backside, advanced three
wide midway down the backside to gain a striking position approaching the final turn, but was unable to sustain her bid over the final furlong.

Footnotes
GROOVIN' IS BAK broke sharply and stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide entering
the final turn, and closed determinedly from the outside of STANFORD NORTH to be up in the closing strides. STANFORD NORTH rushed up to duel for
the lead two wide entering the first turn, force the issue from the outside of SHURAZ in the run down the backstretch, got the better of his pace rival
approaching the final turn to assume command, and just failed to last. ACCORDINGLY settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run
down the backstretch, launched his bid from just off the rail entering the final turn, and finished steadily two out from the rail in the drive to get up for a share.
RICK'S DANCER away alertly, but was taken in hand entering the first turn to assume a stalking trip entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the
final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon in the lane. RANCHO RED settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail
entering the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive in an even effort. ATOMIC HAZE settled at
the back of the pack while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a
serious late impact. SHURAZ away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of STANFORD
NORTH in the run down the backside, was unable to keep tabs on his pace rival entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.
