Footnotes
UNCLE JOCK well placed and outside, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path gaining a short lead into the stretch, shook clear inside the
furlong marker, then lasted under steady pressure. BACKDOORPARTY allowed to settle, moved up while angling out through the turn, came widest into the
stretch, closed well and missed. GOLDEN SODA unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, evened the
final furlong and gained the show. GOVERNOR ATWOOD set the pace on the inside, shook clear through the turn, stayed on when challenged into the
stretch, then weakened late and held a share. HUNTIN' THE RUT tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into
the stretch, then faded the final furlong. GOLDEN OAK stalked the pace on the outside, lost some ground through the turn, then had no stretch rally. GET
ALONG well placed, steadily lost ground.
