narrow lead past mid-stretch and dug in to prove best. KITTY ON FIRE broke alertly and established the early lead, dueled with FAVORITE SONG past
mid-stretch, was outfinished in the late stages and was second best. THE PERFECT GIRL 2 hopped then was bumped at the start and was away a bit
slowly from the gate, chased the leading pair to mid-stretch, was outkicked in the late stages and was a clear third. LUCERO CARTEL 240 broke in at the
start, spotted the field in the early stages and did not factor.

Footnotes
MADAME GAZELLE settled just off of the moderate early pace, went two wide into the turn and was well placed nearing the quarter marker, shifted four
wide approaching the top of the stretch, loomed at the furlong marker, confronted LILA AT THE BEACH past mid-stretch and dueled into the final sixteenth,
took a narrow lead in the final strides and determinedly won the nod on the wire. LILA AT THE BEACH sent to establish the early lead, set moderate
fractions while well handled into the turn, was confronted at the quarter marker by SMOOVE AS SILK and battled that rival into upper stretch, took a narrow
lead at the furlong marker, drifted out while leading past mid-stretch, met the bid of MADAME GAZELLE into the final sixteenth, dueled gamely while on the
left lead and just missed for the win at the finish, while holding clearly for second. SMOOVE AS SILK tracked the moderate early pace from between rivals,
slipped to the inside entering the turn and vied for the lead at the quarter marker, battled LILA AT THE BEACH into upper stretch, could not match strides
with the top pair into the final sixteenth and held well for third at the finish. DADDYS NINA rated off of the moderate early pace and was never far back
heading to the half-mile marker, saved ground into the turn, shifted three wide nearing the quarter pole and chased into the stretch, got caught a bit in tight
at the furlong marker while running behind the drifting LILA AT THE BEACH, could not find the needed response into the final sixteenth and just missed for
third at the wire. A DIME FOR ME the rider lost his irons soon after the start, dropped back and trailed throughout. This race was originally hand timed and
was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC COTTON sent leaving the start, engaged with G G GILLEY in the early going and disputed the solid pace inside of that rival heading to the
half-mile marker, contested the pace into the turn and raced on even terms with G G GILLEY into the stretch, dueled past the furlong marker, responded to
firm urging in deep stretch and determinedly won the nod on the wire to prevail. G G GILLEY broke alertly and showed good speed away from the start, was
engaged by MAJESTIC COTTON and contested the solid early pace outside of that rival heading to the half-mile marker, disputed the pace two wide into
the turn and raced on even terms with MAJESTIC COTTON into upper stretch, dueled past the furlong pole, fought gamely into the final sixteenth and just
missed for the win, while besting the rest. DUNGARVAN OAK was crowded leaving the start and broke a bit slowly, settled off of the solid early pace and
tracked from the second flight heading to the half-mile marker, gained ground into the turn and was well placed while two to three wide nearing the quarter
pole, ran evenly while within aim into the stretch, was outkicked by the leading pair in the final sixteenth and was a clear third. CAUSE FOR DIVORCE
allowed to settle away from the start while not far back, saved ground into the turn and lost position at the quarter pole, angled out into the stretch and
re-rallied at the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and flattened out in deep stretch. BEAUTY IN AUTISM broke out a bit at the
start and crowded a neighboring rival, settled off of the solid early pace, was guided two wide along the turn and did not factor in the stretch drive. MY
AMIGO prominent away from the start, chased the solid early pace three deep nearing the half-mile marker, ran in pursuit three wide into the turn, lost
position at the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and faded in the late stages. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using
video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
EFFECTIVE GIG hustled from the the gate, seized the early advantage, slowed the pace through the first half-mile traveling well, quickened away with three
furlongs to run still in hand, opened up at the top of the stretch, extended the margin and held sway to the wire. STAY LIT settled mid-pack through the early
going, advanced some down the backstretch run, was set down from the three furlong marker, got a good inside run into the stretch and finished well under
handling and intermittent urging to gain second while no threat to the winner. COOPERKLIMT was content to track two or three lengths behind the slow
pace racing in the two or three path throughout, kept up an even pace to the finish, had no late kick but held third. FANTASTIC DREAM got good inside
position early and tracked behind EFFECTIVE GIG, moved off the rail down the backstretch to the three path, came under a stiff ride with three furlongs to
run but could not find the needed response. CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY off a beat slow, tracked four wide through the first turn then settled at the rear of the
field heading into the backstretch then became boxed in when the tracking group bunched up passing the half-mile marker, then had to wait for room
through the far turn, angled to the rail for a late bid down the stretch but raced on the wrong lead for most of the stretch and finished willingly but could not
improve. RULER OF ANGELS got caught five wide going into the first turn, continued to take the same path down the backstretch and into the far turn,
attempted rally from the quarter pole, came five wide into the stretch and finished evenly but was unable to make up the lost ground.

Footnotes
WORK TO LIVE was forwardly placed away from the start, settled in the second flight and saved ground into the first turn, tracked the decent pace through
the backstretch run and maintained an inside position into the far turn, was roused at the quarter marker and taken off of the rail, mounted a three wide bid
between rivals into the stretch, loomed at the furlong pole and battled PROOF OF JAZZ into the final sixteenth, surged to take command in deep stretch and
held in the final strides for a determined win. PROOF OF JAZZ broke alertly and was sent away from the start, cleared into the first turn and set the pace
into the backstretch run, was well handled while setting decent fractions approaching the half-mile, dictated terms into the far turn and was clear at the
quarter pole, felt pressure into upper stretch, drifted under firm handling and led to the furlong pole, met the bid of WORK TO LIVE past mid-stretch, was not
able to hold off the determined winner in deep stretch and held safely for second at the wire. DERRYGOOLIN prominent away from the start, stalked the
early pace from a two wide path into the first turn, stalked the decent pace along the backstretch run and was well placed approaching the half-mile, chased
PROOF OF JAZZ into the far turn and went three to four wide nearing the quarter marker, raced widest into the stretch and inched closer at the furlong pole,
could not match strides with the top pair into the final sixteenth and was clear for third. ISABEL LUDLOW settled off of the early pace, tracked outside of an
inner rival entering the backstretch run and gained ground at the half-mile, maintained a two wide path into the far turn, chased into the stretch and rallied at
the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and flattened out in deep stretch. MASTERY KAT allowed to settle away from the start,
saved ground into the first turn, maintained an inside path through the backstretch run, saved all of the ground into the far turn and did not offer a response
in the stretch drive. BOLD DAUGHTER was squeezed leaving the start and was away a bit slowly, was allowed to settle in the early going and trailed into
the first turn, unhurried through the backstretch run, was guided three wide into the second turn and did not factor in the stretch drive. This race was
originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

MR. FIGHTER threw his head up as the gates opened then was rank in the initial stages of the race, steered to the outside then settled, tracked UNCLE
JUAN into the turn, moved to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, briefly met some resistance but responded to strong handling, took command in
upper stretch, drew clear then easily held off a late bid. WESTERN CAPE raced at the rear of the very tightly bunched pack, lost a little ground on the turn
then swung to the three path for the stretch run, found another gear and rallied into second while racing on the wrong lead, was steadily gaining on the
winner to the wire but ran out of time. UNCLE JUAN broke well and cleared the field early, sent a solid pace to the quarter pole, briefly fought back when
challenged by MR. FIGHTER then tired mid-stretch and was outfinished by the top pair. AUTISM INCLUSION broke last then rushed up to join the early
pace, got close to UNCLE JUAN near the five furlong marker then had to be ridden some to keep up when that one quickened the pace going into the turn,
continued to race close up inside through the turn, then struggled to keep up when the top two pulled away and had nothing to offer in the stretch. This race
was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

JULIET'S KITCHEN prominent away from the start, rated nicely off of the solid early pace and tracked between rivals heading to the half-mile pole, raced
three wide into the turn, was roused at the quarter marker and mounted a five wide rally into the stretch, improved position while widest at the furlong
marker, rallied into the final sixteenth, reeled in HARBOR DEAREST in deep stretch and got up in the final strides to prevail. HARBOR DEAREST sent
leaving the start, stalked the solid early pace from between rivals approaching the half-mile marker, advanced into the turn and pressed the pace outside of
PANDA PEAK heading to the quarter pole, took command into the stretch and drew clear at the furlong marker, kept to task while clear into the final
sixteenth, was caught in the final strides by the oncoming winner and was clear of the rest for second. PANDA PEAK sent leaving the start, assumed early
command and set solid a solid pace heading to the half-mile marker, was engaged into the turn by HARBOR DEAREST and contested the pace inside of
that rival approaching the quarter pole, was overtaken into the stretch and chased HARBOR DEAREST to the furlong grounds, could not match strides with
the top pair into the final sixteenth and held for third. STREET TIGER was forwardly placed leaving the start, raced close up to the early pace while between
rivals heading to the half-mile, ran in pursuit two wide and between horses nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked into the stretch, could not muster the
needed late response and was outfinished for third. STANDFORGRIT raced close up to the solid early pace while on a hold, was given rein and stalked the
pace between rivals heading to the half-mile marker, advanced to press the pace three wide into the turn, lost ground and chased the leading pair
approaching the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. ALMOST GOT LUCKY broke out at the start and
was off a bit slowly, rushed up while widest in the early stages and chased the solid pace heading to the half-mile marker, disputed the pace four wide into
the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter pole and ran in pursuit into the stretch, could not find a response into the drive and gave way. NO BEACHES
unhurried away from the start, trailed in the early stages, was guided two to three wide along the turn, swung wide for the stretch drive and did not factor.
GALWAY SHAWL hustled away from the start, stalked the solid early pace from the inside, got caught a bit in tight approaching the turn, chased from the
inside along the bend, was outrun into the stretch and tired in the final furlong. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology
to arrive at the most accurate time.
