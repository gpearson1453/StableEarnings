entering the stretch and closed strongly. RUBY RENDEZVOUS hopped slightly at the start then moved up to dueled BELLE WEATHER from along the
outside, drifted out slightly to be four-wide entering the stretch and held on well for third. ARMY KNIFE was unhurried while racing four-wide on the turn and
went evenly late. DEB'S DIAMOND was reserved off the pace while racing three-wide on the turn and lacked a rally. LOVINGKINDNESS was allowed to

Footnotes
CREATIVE BID was reserved off the early pace while racing two-wide, angled out to be five-wide entering the stretch and closed strongly to be up in the
final strides. MEANT FOR ME prompted OVERLY FAST early from along the inside then dropped back to stalk that one entering the back stretch, came
four-wide into the stretch, took the lead nearing the eighth pole but wasn't able to resist the winner late in a game try. OVERLY FAST set the pace under
pressure early then opened a clear lead on the back stretch, drifted out slightly nearing the three-sixteenths pole, responded when headed nearing the
eighth pole and held on well for third. CORN POP saved ground while being allowed to settle early, slipped through entering the stretch to offer a bid
entering the stretch and then flattened out during the drive. HAPPY DOES was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch then angled further out
during the drive and went evenly late. I'M NOBLE dropped back early and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SECRET HOTTIE saved ground setting the pace under pressure from MOCKTAILS ANYONE, opened a clear lead nearing the eighth pole and then was
hard ridden to hold that one off late. MOCKTAILS ANYONE prompted the pace from along the outside, dropped back slightly nearing the eighth pole then
was coming on again late to be gaining on the winner in a game effort. BUMPING RIVER saved ground chasing the top two, was unable to threaten them
but finished well for end up in a dead-heat for third with COASTAL GIRL in a steady effort. COASTAL GIRL was allowed to settle while racing three-wide on
the turn, came four-wide into the stretch and ended up on even terms with BUMPING RIVER for third while finishing in a mild rally. CLEARWATER BELLE
was reserved off the early pace, came three-wide into the stretch and improved her position. BELLAREIGN was unhurried early, came five-wide into the
stretch and failed to seriously threaten. KOOL KADILLAC was prominent early while racing three-wide and tired.

Footnotes
HADLEES HONOR prompted UNCLE JUJU from along the outside, took the lead from that one nearing the eighth pole and gradually drew clear. BLUES
RAPPER was allowed to settle, rallied three-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. UNCLE JUJU saved ground setting the pace, responded when
headed and held on well for third. NYQUILER broke in the air to get away behind his field then saved ground while being allowed to settle, angled out to be
three-wide nearing the eighth pole and rallied late. SPORT COAT was close-up while racing two-wide but lacked a rally when asked. DARK MYSTERY was
reserved off the pace while racing three-wide and failed to seriously threaten. VALIDATE was forwardly placed while racing four-wide, came five-wide into
the stretch but had no response when asked.
