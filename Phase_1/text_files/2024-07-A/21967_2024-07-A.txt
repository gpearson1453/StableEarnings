around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and kicked clear late. RIDIN SOLO bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, recovered to
duel between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path around the turn and kept on to the finish. KA POW raced off the pace early,
navigated the turn from the four path, launched a bid in upper stretch and gained ground late. STRAITFROMTHEDUECE bumped with the horse to his
inside leaving the gate, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the four path and faded in the stretch. CARPE GOLD
led the way on the inside through the opening quarter, continued around the turn in the two path and tired in the lane.

the far turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground to get up for the win late. SLIM SLOW SLIDER raced in the five path around the first
bend, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far bend from the four path and dueled to the finish to narrowly miss. DIVINE
LEADER raced in the four path early, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the second turn in the three path and kept on to the
wire. CROCODILEHUNTER raced in the three path around the first turn, led the way on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the second turn in
the two path and gave way in late stretch. NORTH ARM BAY raced in the two path around the first bend, chased the leader between horses up the
backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and faded from there. ARREST tracked the leaders on the inside through the opening half mile,

IL CAPITANO hopped up and was away from the gate sharply, raced in the two path around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, continued to save
ground around the far bend and held clear to the wire. MULBERRY STREET raced in the four path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack for
the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the rail coming around the far turn and improved position in the lane. KOWBOYKABIN raced in the three path
around the first bend, chased the leader up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and kept on in the stretch. MEET JOE raced off the
pace on the inside through the opening half mile, came around the second turn in the three path and never threatened. REDISUR saved ground early,
trailed the field up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and made no bid. TOTAL SURPRISE raced in the three path around the
first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the second turn still in the three path and was empty in the lane.

Footnotes
CLOUDLESS BLUE tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, began a bid entering the stretch and
gained ground late to get up for the win. EMERYANDAVERY dueled on the inside through the opening quarter, led the way from the two path around the
bend and into the stretch and was caught late. MOLLYS MIA stalked the leader on the inside early, saved ground around the bend and kept on to the finish.
KOOL KARMA was reluctant to load, delaying the start by several minutes, broke sharply to duel on the outside up the backstretch, dropped back while
racing in the two path around the turn and faded in the lane.
