I'M THE CABANA BOY unhurried, looped up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove clear late. CHIPS
LEGACY sprinted away from the field in the early going, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then was no match for the winner late, while clearly
best of the rest. FAST LEARNER mid pack, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, drifted in and weakened
late. PARTY AT THE BEACH unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and
got up for a share. IMPOSTER SYNDROME mid pack, moved up and was carried out badly through the turn, then angled in and passed a tiring rival in the
lane. COLORFUL LAD hopped at the start, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch and faded. PETER
RABBIT QUICK bore out in the early going, bolted through the turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
STAR TOPPER mid pack, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room,
exchanging bumps with SOUPERSILVERDOLLAR, then made a steady gain, edged ahead and held. IRISH STONE unhurried, moved up while angling out
through the turn, came widest into the stretch, drifted in slightly, made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. ATROCIOUS tracked the pace back,
saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain, dueled late with SECRET TREASURE and finished on
equal terms with that one. SECRET TREASURE stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide
outside the leader, then dueled with ATROCIOUS in the late going and finished on equal terms with that one. SOUPERSILVERDOLLAR well placed and
outside, gained position three wide through the second turn, bid four wide outside the leader into the stretch, then exchanged bumps with the winner and
weakened. CHASING KITTY sprinted away from the field, faded the final furlong. LITTLE MISS MUNNY was no factor.

Footnotes
DIGITAL FOOTPRINT well placed and off the rail, gained a striking position two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, made a
steady gain, dueled late with SEA SPLENDOR, edged ahead of that one late and held. SEA SPLENDOR tracked the pace back, saved ground through the
turns, angled out to bid between rivals into the stretch, then dueled with the winner late and was outfinished. JO JO HANS mid pack, saved ground through
the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and closed well for the show. MARSAC sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when
challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held a share. PATRIOT DRIVE unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals
into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and evened out. ECLIPTICALS BEAR bumped and shuffled back at the start, looped up three and four
wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. CLEAR FOR ACTION stalked the pace on the outside, held position on
the two path through the second turn, then faded into the stretch. HEIRLOOM KITTEN mid pack, moved up on the two path through the second turn, then
faded into the stretch. GALAXY BUILDER was never involved.
