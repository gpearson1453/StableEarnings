Footnotes
GOSSIPER settled in range two wide, tipped three wide to advance around the far turn, seized command nearing the eighth pole and edged ahead under
left-handed urging. DUDEFOOLINGDARLING stalked the pace three wide around the first turn, pressed two wide around the far turn, drifted out in the
stretch, led in midstretch but was outfinished late. TAKE YOUR POINT tracked the pace three wide, lacked the needed rally but kept on well to hold the
show between foes. BELLA CARMELINA was pinched back at the start, raced off the pace two and three wide, shifted out in upper stretch and kept on for a
minor slice. I LOVE IRELAND raced off the pace two wide, swung five wide in upper stretch and had a mild belated rally. AWESOME EMPRESS pressed
the pace in the three path around the first turn, cleared down the backstretch, set the pace along the rail around the far turn, led to midstretch and tired.
SHINING SKYE had her head turned at the start, saved ground well back and never threatened. BIGBOUQUETOFROSES broke out and bumped at the
start, saved ground in midpack, tipped two wide near the quarter pole and lacked a closing bid. TARIBA DREAM failed to menace while racing three and
four wide. MONEY ON ICE was bumped at the start, set the pace in the two path around the first turn, chased inside down the backstretch and faltered
around the far turn. STARSHIP DYNASTY played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
RATED BY MERIT set the pace in the two path, waited confidently in the three path rounding the turn, was roused from the four path at the top of the lane,
and kicked away. FORGED STEEL prompted the pace in the four path, was coaxed along outside the winning pacesetter rounding the turn, lost touch with
that foe while in the five path at the top of the stretch, but chased on while drifting in for place. LAWLER got fractious in the gate during the loading process,
bumped at the start with an outer foe, stalked in the five path, received a right handed cue in the four path passing the three-eighths pole, flattened from the
five path down the lane, but held onto show. I KNOW I KNOW bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased between foes out in the six path, was driven in
the five path around the turn, fanned out to the seven path entering the stretch, but made no impact. PARTY HARDY raced off the pace in the three path
and failed to factor from the five path down the lane. MY SATISFACTION tracked in the four path early but faded along the rail around the turn. GOLD
THIEF trailed in the three path and never threatened. FRIOLENTO rated out in the seven path and failed to menace.

Footnotes
MR. AMERICAN stalked between foes in the two path, bid under coaxing passing the quarter, swung from the four path into the lane, took the lead before
the eighth pole, and drew clear. XY FACE bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked inside, had to wait behind the leaders around the turn, angled out to
the five path turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. ROMPING RUNNER got bumped by an outer foe into an inner foe at the start, rated in the three
path, waited around the turn before tipping out after a right handed cue passing the quarter, swung from the seven path into the stretch, and kept on while
on his left lead for show. DON'T ANSWER trailed inside, was coaxed along in the three path around the turn, and stayed on from the two path down the
lane, but was out of time. MAYHEMINTHEPALACE got bumped by an outer foe and steadied at the start, raced off the pace in the three path, was ridden in
the four path around the turn, fanned widest out to the eight path turning into the lane, and made no impact. GRAND BEY bumped with an inner foe at the
start, chased inside but flattened in the final furlong. GALIPAN broke in and bumped an inner foe, set the pace inside, received a right handed cue midway
around the turn, lost the lead and brushed the rail in upper stretch, then yielded in the final furlong. BOURBON WARRIOR was prompted from in range in
the four path but weakened from the six path in the stretch. OUR FORTUNE COOKIE got bumped by an outer foe into an inner foe at the start, laid up close
between foes in the three path but gaveway from the five path in the stretch.

GRAND TOWER set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. RAPSCALLION chased the winner in the three path and was clearly second best.
JOE FROM KIEV popped the gate open prior to the start, broke sharply once re-set, chased the pace inside and kept on for the show without threatening.
PRINCE DAVID failed to menace while racing two wide. RAGMAN had some speed three wide but steadily faded. BERNARD THEATRE trailed inside.

Footnotes
BARRY THE BUILDER raced off the pace in the three path, was ridden in the five path around the far turn, fanned out to the seven path at the top of the
lane, and rallied to get up at the wire. MANHATTAN BOY chased in the five path, ranged up under a drive approaching the quarter, made a sweeping bid
and bumped an inner foe from the five path in upper stretch, ran on to stick his head in front passing the eighth pole, but was nailed at the wire by an outer
foe to place. BATTLE OF DOVER stalked in the four path, was roused to take command turning into the stretch, got bumped by a challenging outer foe
immediately after, dug in to duel with that foe into the final furlong, but yielded in the final sixteenth to show. MOTIVO had his head turned as the gates
opened, tracked in the two path, was roused from the four path early around the far turn, angled inside in upper stretch, but evened out in the final furlong.
YEAGER raced in midpack along the inside down the backstretch, was cued from the two path midway around the far turn, angled out to the six path at the
top of the lane, but was one paced. KUWAIT TOWERS rated in the four path, was driven from the two path turning into the lane, but steadied passing the
eighth pole, and could not factor. TIZ THE COAST prompted the pace around the first turn from the three path, but got stymied in the two path turning into
the lane, and faded. LORD OF THE NILE trailed in the two path, altered outside of rivals in upper stretch, but failed to bid. SIR BANANA BRIAN laid up
close along the inside, swung out to the five path turning into the lane, but weakened. SUMMER STORM STRIC was unhurried from out in the six path
down the backstretch but never threatened. BANNEKER showed the way from the four path turning into the backstretch, opened up while merging to the
two path passing the half, waited around the far turn, but gaveway in the stretch. CALYPSO CHARLIE raced wellback in the two path and never menaced.

stalked the pace two and three wide and ran on willingly to be clearly second best. DRINKS ON ME trailed inside, swung widest in upper stretch and was up
for the show on the wire. BARBARA raced off the pace three wide and improved position in the lane. CHECK THE GRADE set a clear pace in the two path,
continued on the left lead in the lane and tired. IDEAL BREEZE chased the pace four wide and weakened in the drive. GITANA failed to menace while

Footnotes
TAPIT'S DIRECTION moved up after the opening quarter to show the way in the two path, was coaxed along the inside passing the three-eighths pole,
kicked on from the two path to inch clear in upper stretch, and held sway. LOOKINASSAH trailed in the four path, ranged up five wide approaching the
quarter, took aim at the top of the lane, and ran on for place. DOWN IN THE VALLEY was hustled from up close in the three path, driven between foes in
the two path around the turn, angled out to the six path in upper stretch, and kept on for show. AWESOME TRAIN rated in the six path, was cued while four
wide entering the far turn, floated out to the eight path turning into the stretch, but was one paced. ANTILLEAN got rank at the start, led thru the opening
quarter before being prompted along while in range from the five path thereafter, bid three wide under a drive going by the three-eighths pole, but weakened
in the stretch. CHACHARERO tracked inside but backed up around the turn.

Footnotes
HAULIN ICE rated in the five path, ranged up three wide under rousing midway around the turn, took command while floating out to the five path at the top
of the lane, and kicked away. MIUCCIA bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the two path, was coaxed along the rail around the turn, angled out
passing the quarter, chased on from the five path down the stretch for place. CANDY GRAY bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the four path,
was driven around the turn, and was along in the seven path down the lane for show. STILETTO HEELS pressed the pace in the three path but yielded at
the top of the stretch. R HARPER ROSE set the pace in the two path, was cued from off the rail passing the three-eighths pole, but gaveway in the stretch.
MARSHMALLOW QUEEN stumbled at the start, chased inside but never menaced. FIELDS OF GREEN broke out at the start, stalked in the four path but
was empty entering the lane.

Footnotes
CATCH A TIGER set a clear pace in the two path, drifted out in the stretch and held firm. GOES THE CLOWN had early speed outside, was forced five wide
into the first turn by the loose horse, angled down into the three path near the midway point of the bend, raced closest the winner in the three path from
there, bid nearing the quarter pole, angled in while the winner drifted out while clear in midstretch, could not seriously gain on that foe and held well clear of
the rest. COME TO PAPA raced off the pace two wide, swung eight wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. LIFE IS PRECIOUS saved ground off the
pace, angled four wide in upper stretch and had a mild rally. SALTWATER COWBOY hesitated at the start, trailed in the three path early, made slight
progress three wide around the far turn, angled six wide in upper stretch and was no threat. FROM THE CLOUDS hit the starting gate, raced four wide and
was no threat. JIMBO BAILEY chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. MIDNIGHT COUNCIL was outrun inside. DEVILMENT gave chase
two wide and lacked a closing bid. QUATROCENTO stumbled badly at the start, unseating the rider, galloped along with the field and walked off. THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND FOUND NO REASON TO TAKE ACTION.
