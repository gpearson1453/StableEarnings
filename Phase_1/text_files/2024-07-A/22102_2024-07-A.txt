Footnotes
SILKY WARRIOR (IRE) unhurried in the early going, commenced a steady advance rallying on the far turn from five wide and prevailed in the final strides in
a well timed ride. EMITYAAZ took a clear lead on a well rated pace, responded when called upon turning for home and battled through the lane gamely only
to be caught in the final strides. NO NANNETTE NO stalked the pace throughout and made a mild bid turning for home. CAIRO SUMMER prompted the
pace from three wide to the quarter pole and lacked a closing response. DIXIE LOVING broke a step slow to be at the rear of the field and continued on as a
non-threat. LUNARCHY raced in contention for the first three-eighths and steadily faded.

FUTURE VISION stalked the pace through the turn, rallied from five wide turning for home, angled inside the drifting out pace presser ot split rivals in
mid-stretch and wore down the runnerup in deep stretch. MINNESOTA MOON dueled from the rail on the lead to the quarter pole, took command to open a
clear lead in upper stretch and could not hold off the winner late. I'M YOUR CAPTAIN reserved off the pace to track the leaders to upper stretch and made a
late bid to be along for the show. OVER CALENDARED unhurried to be at the rear of the main body of the field to the top of the lane and showed god late
interest with a belated stretch rally. TEA WITH LEMON slow early to be the distant trailer and was never a threat. IRONMAN RICHIE pressed the pace to
the quarter pole and drifted wide while tiring in the lane.

Footnotes
MAHONEY ROAD set a pressured pace down the backside, repelled an early challenge in the far turn, opened a clear lead turning for home and drew off as
much the best while kept to task down the lane. PATH TO SUCCESS unhurried for the first half mile, gained ground on the backstretch whiel saving ground
along the fence, waited behind a wall of runners early in the far turn, angled six wide at the head of the lane and finished well to be second best. JIM AND
JIM tracked the leaders down the backside, was put to an early drive when well placed in striking distance along the fence on the final bend and finished
evenly. MR FROST prompted the pace for the first half mile, amde an early bid from the fence entering the far turn and failed to sustain the bid. STORM'S
REFLECTION reserved off the pace for five-eighths, made a four wide bid on the turn and flattened out in the lane. LAWMAKER stalked from three wide for
a half mile and came up empty.

COME ON LADY pressed the pace to upper stretch, dueled through the lane exchanging the lead several times and prevailed by a flared nostril at the wire.
LALY set a pressured pace from the inside the entire way, battled gamely through the stretch, surrendered and retook the lead in deep stretch only to be
nailed on the line. MURPHY'S COMBO went to the gate early, was reluctant to load, stalked the pace saving ground through the turn and kept-on to hold
the show. AIR GERRI bobbled at the start, regained footing only to be bumped severly by the outside rvial leaving the gate, tracked the leaders the rest of
the way making a mild bid in the lane. THE LAST THRILL ducked in away from the gate to bump inside rival causing the rider to be off balance away from
the gate, and showed some late interest in the stretch run. WAHIDA OF MARDAN chased the leaders from four wide through the turn and flattened out.
HARPER BRIANA was not a threat.

ARRIVEDERCCI stumbled at the start, bumped by outside rival recovered to range up three wide turning for home and could not get passed in the drive

Footnotes
LOOKIN FOR REVENGE stalked the pacesetter to the far turn, rallied on the bend to take control, and quickly drew clear as much the best. SON OF
GRACE reserved off the pace near the rear of the field for the first half mile, made a steady advance from four wide on the far turn and kept grinding through
the lane to be second best. WICKED SUPRISE set the pace on a clear lead to just before the quarter pole, had no response when engaged by the winner
and weakened through the stretch. KRAMDEN tracked the leaders to the far turn and failed to mount a closing rally. STORM BORN was slow early to be the
distant trailer and was never a factor. HONEST TO GOODNESS contedned for the first half mile and gave way.
