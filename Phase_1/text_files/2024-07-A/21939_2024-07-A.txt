Footnotes
SOMNUS crowded just after the break, jostled briefly between HALF THE BATTLE and CARNACK ON TOUR, soon moved ahead in hand, widened
command when let out on the bend then steadily opened up under urging through the lane. LORD ZEKE hesitated at the start, saved ground in midpack the
first half mile, angled three wide for the stretch run and took over second with a sixteenth left. PLAY THE BLUES chased from outside, was just off the rail
taking the turn, lost ground fanning out widest for the drive, showed a willingness to run late and caught CARNACK ON TOUR for third. CARNACK ON
TOUR broke outward, crowding and brushing SOMNUS, pressed that one early from inside, did not keep up on the turn, was no match for the latter when
set down for the drive and gradually wore down in the late going. CUTADAY stumbled at the start, saved ground through the bend and lacked the needed
stretch bid. DRINKING TOUR void of speed, had the rail on the turn, angled out some at the top of the lane then again deep stretch as he made up minor
ground. HALF THE BATTLE jostled briefly with SOMNUS shortly after the start, raced in contention toward the outside, came four wide into the stretch and
steadily yielded.

Footnotes
ELENA MAE stalked the early speed, swept past HEAVENLY SCENT when let out on the bend, drifted out to path four entering the stretch then steadily
opened up with mostly hand urging. TU ROYAL was away slowly, settled well off the inside, lost considerable ground widest taking the turn, passed outside
tired ones and caught DRAGONFLY KISSES for second late. DRAGONFLY KISSES advanced three wide on the bend, angled outside ELENA MAE at the
top of the lane, edged ahead for second, began to drift out after entering the final furlong, was outfinished for second but clearly best of the rest.
STARSOVERPARADISE progressed just outside DRAGONFLY KISSES through the turn, lost ground staying outside that one into the stretch, began to
yield inside the eighth pole, was steadied shortly after that when her path narrowed behind DRAGONFLY KISSES then continued to fade. BEE A WINNER
could only pass outside tired ones in the stretch. HEAVENLY SCENT moved clear of BUNNY SHINE after the first furlong, had the rail on the turn, was
overtaken from outside by ELENA MAE then gave way for the drive. BUNNY SHINE pressed the early pace on the backstretch but faded two wide on the
bend.

Footnotes
MOCOWBELL rated on the front end, moved clear when allowed three wide on the bend, was roused leaving the turn, drew away upper stretch and
maintained full control ridden out under confident handling. KRUELESS pressed just outside MOCOWBELL, did not keep up four wide on the turn, floated
out some as he took over second midstretch, was no match for the latter the last eighth but maintained his hold on the place. JUSTICEONEMORETIME
advanced two wide on the bend, fanned out behind KRUELESS entering the lane, gained a clear path nearing the eighth pole, took over third soon after and
proved clearly best of the others. DURANGO CHROME chased from the far outside, was four to six wide taking the turn then improved position some in the
lane without threatening. ANUNKA was sent to be an early factor from inside, retreated into the bend, gradually angled out through the turn, lost
considerable ground fanning out to the middle of the track for the stretch run and passed tired ones. LORD SHAFTESBURY chased from between rivals
and was never a factor. INSIDE THE CIRCLE was hustled to contest the pace from inside on the backstretch, did not stay with MOCOWBELL on the turn
and gave way just off the inside the final furlong. TOWN CRIER was a contender just off the inside on the backstretch but faded along the rail through the
bend. SMOOTH ATTACK displayed early speed between rivals but began his steady retreat before finishing a half mile.

Footnotes
MODAZZLE hesitated then made a small leap from the gate, progressed three wide on the turn, angled in some entering the lane, rallied under urging, took
over nearing the sixteenth marker then steadily drew away to be much the best. MY LITTLE TIPSY set a pressured pace off the rail but inside
CRANKSHAFT, stayed just off the inside through the bend, floated out to path four into the stretch, could not hold back MODAZZLE inside the last furlong,
began to wear down in the waning yards but lasted for the place. NOT AGAIN JACKIE chased from just off the inside, angled out four wide at the top of the
stretch and rallied belatedly between horses. GREAT PLAINES raced in contention running widest for five furlongs then began to flatten. PERFECT
WAGER soon trailed, saved ground, gradually angled out to gain a clear path in the lane and passed outside tired ones late. WINDIGO SPIRIT broke alertly
but outward, was soon overtaken, chased from between rivals, saved ground through the bend and also flattened out for the drive. CRANKSHAFT pressed
the early speed from just outside then gave way from between horses in the stretch.

Footnotes
GOLD OAK rated on the front end from outside, moved clear when allowed on the turn, saved ground then maintained full control under urging in the
stretch. JAMAICAN TRAFFIC was settled inside early, rallied along the rail leaving the bend, steadily closed the gap and caught HALLIE'S RAINBOW for
second. HALLIE'S RAINBOW vied for the early lead between rivals, did not stay with GOLD OAK through the turn then weakened deep stretch between
rivals. MISS MIA chased in midpack from just off the rail, lodged a mild bid upper stretch, battled for third, could only make up minor ground in the late going
and was outfinished for the show. CAT TALE BREEZE lost ground four to six wide taking the turn and also only make up minor ground deep stretch. BLUE
EVEN SCORE was bumped from the rear leaving the chute, forced out by a loose horse and steadied after travelling the first furlong, lost ground widest
through the bend then showed late interest outside rivals. WILDWOOD GHALY chased from between foes, rallied upper stretch to vie for third but could not
sustain her bid late. MIDNIGHT SOCIETY fractious in the gate, was a factor from inside on the backstretch, angled out entering the turn and steadily gave
way. LORI ATTACK stumbled badly a few strides from the gate, bumped BLUE EVEN SCORE and lost her rider. There was a stewards' inquiry into LORI
ATTACK'S start but no action was taken after their review.

Footnotes
DENNIS'S PRIDE moved outside XPRESSIR early on, closed the gap on that one through the turn, came into the lane from path three, was all out the last
furlong and got up in time. XPRESSIR broke on top and soon drew away from the rest, showed the way in hand, was roused leaving the bend, shook free of
DENNIS'S PRIDE upper stretch but did not have enough left in the waning yards. MAMAS FIRE chased the top pair from outside, came into contention from
path four on the turn, did not stay close upper stretch but rallied belatedly the final furlong. HIGHLY PERFECT void of speed, though hustled along, saved
ground and passed inside tired ones in the stretch. ON THE MONEY RED chased from between rivals, angled to the outside with a half mile to go, came
four wide into the lane and had no late bid. BRIANS WAY chased in midpack from inside, came off the rail some entering the lane, his rider lost his riding
crop upper stretch and he steadily faded. AFTER MY BROTHER chased from paths two or three and was never a factor. COWGIRL FRANKIE dwelt at the
start, was far back of the rest of the field when she left the gate, had no chance but finished the course. There was a stewards' inquiry into COWGIRL
FRANKIE'S start but no action was taken after their review.

Footnotes
BE MY BESTIE rated along the rail, dropped back some when her path narrowed into the bend, waited for room on the turn, squeezed through along the rail
upper stretch, edged ahead inside the last eighth, shook free nearing the sixteenth marker and kept BLAME TERI at bay under steady handling. BLAME
TERI in the second flight just off the rail on the backstretch, split rivals leaving the turn, edged ahead three wide upper stretch but slowly began to yield
inside the final furlong. MISS DUTTON trailed from well off the inside, moved to the rail into the bend, commenced her rally, battled for third from inside the
last seventy yards and edged ahead in time. DIXIE PENNY was prominent toward the outside from the beginning, lost ground four then five wide taking the
turn, took over third inside the final eighth, battled on even terms with MISS DUTTON the final seventy yards, was outfinished but clearly best of the others.
LICHITA displayed early speed just outside FROSTED ECLAIR, floated out some leaving the turn and flattened out between rivals the last furlong.
FROSTED ECLAIR vied for the lead off the rail but inside LICHITA on the backstretch, moved toward the rail into the bend, edged ahead, came off the
inside slightly entering the stretch and began to fade. ANGEL EXPRESS was a brief contender from outside but gave way widest through the turn.
CATCHUSIFYOUCAN stayed off the inside and failed to menace.
