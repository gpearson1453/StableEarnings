Footnotes
TONY'S TAPIT tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming around the turn and drew off in the stretch to win
easily. EXXEL chased the leader between horses early, navigated the turn from the two path and kept on to the finish, no match for the winner. MINISTER
OF SOUL pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and gave way in the lane. CENTRAL PARK dueled
between horses through the opening quarter, came around the bend in the four path and weakened in the stretch. BUGLER hopped up leaving the gate,
stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
MR NAVIGATOR raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, began a bid
from the three path coming around the far turn and gained ground late to kick clear. LORING PARK bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate,
raced in the two path early, dueled between horses up the backstretch and around the far bend and was caught in the final furlong but chased the winner
home. SKIPPY'S STRIKE hit the gate leaving it, raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated
the far turn still in the three path, challenged nearing the quarter pole, dueled in upper stretch and could not go with the winner late but kept on to the wire.
CRAFTY KING saved ground off the pace through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and
improved position in the lane. INESPERADO was away from the gate slowly, raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside
up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and finished evenly. TWOKO BAY saved ground early, chased the leader on the inside up the
backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn and was outkicked in the stretch. JUST PLAIN ORNERY saved ground around the first bend,
dueled on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back while racing on the rail around the far turn and continued to weaken in the lane. ARTIE'S ANGEL
bumped with the horse to his inside at the break, raced in the four path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up
the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the far bend and never threatened. REJECTION HURTS raced in the middle of the pack on the
inside through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the far turn and made no bid. SARGE'S SERMON raced in the three path around the
first bend, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses, navigated the second turn from the four path and was empty in the lane.
NILES CHANNEL stumbled badly leaving the gate and bumped with the horse to his outside in the process, saved ground while trailing the field throughout
and was never a factor.
