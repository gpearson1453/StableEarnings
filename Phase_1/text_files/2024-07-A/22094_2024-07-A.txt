BREEZING ALONG pressing leader to far turn, took over cleared impressive fashion. CAT'S SYMPHONY good position to the half inside, shifted out stretch
bested rest. JANKA inside trip to far turn, ran along evenly in the stretch, showed. KITTEN'S TEMPER raced well back to far turn and only improved position
late going. COLORMECAIRO sent to the lead quickly, battled hard to far turn, weakened late. OLD FASHIONED GIRL tried hard to keep up early on, gave
way from far turn, empty. ORDERLY TRANSITION (GB) close up outside first turn with a steady fade backstretch. JOYFUL CROWN (IRE) never menaced
throughout. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
