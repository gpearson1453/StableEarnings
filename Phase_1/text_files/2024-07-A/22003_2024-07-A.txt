Footnotes
ICY MISCHIEF sent to be forwardly placed in the early stages, engaged with CONNECT THE DROPS heading to the half-mile marker and contested the
pace with that rival into the turn, shook free along the bend and drew to a clear lead nearing the quarter pole, extended the lead into the stretch, was ridden
out past the furlong marker and drew off in the final sixteenth to be much the best. SUSIE CRU allowed to settle while never far back in the early running,
improved position four wide into the turn and chased ICY MISCHIEF approaching the quarter pole, could not match strides with the winner into the stretch
run and held well for second in the late stages. UNION HARBOR broke out at the start, was away slowly from the gate and trailed in the early stages,
improved position four wide into the turn, needed more in the stretch drive but stayed on into the final sixteenth and was clear for third at the finish. TO
BEVY'S chased the moderate early pace from between rivals, got caught in tight entering the turn and made contact with DARLIN CLEMENTINE, ran in
pursuit four wide heading to the quarter pole, was outrun into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. KISSES WITH ROSES broke alertly, vied for the
early lead leaving the start then ceded the lead and chased from the inside heading to the half-mile, got caught a bit in tight into the turn, shifted two wide
midway through the bend and lost ground nearing the quarter marker, lacked a response in the stretch drive and gave way in the final furlong. DARLIN
CLEMENTINE forwardly placed away from the start, chased the early pace from between rivals, raced two wide and between runners into the turn, came in
tight, was jostled and was shuffled back midway through the bend, dropped back nearing the quarter pole and could not muster a response in the stretch
drive. CONNECT THE DROPS hustled away from the start, assumed early command then was engaged by ICY MISCHIEF nearing the half-mile marker,
disputed the pace inside of that rival heading into the turn, was outrun along the bend, stopped in upper stretch, was eased through the lane and walked off
under her own power. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time. PER RULING
ECM2024-204 FROM HIWU, ICY MISCHIEF WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSTIVE TEST.

Footnotes
ITS THIEVERY got good early position and alternately stalked and pressed the moderate pace being set by AZURE STAR (IRE), began an extended drive
from the half mile pole, took command after passing the three furlong marker maintained a short lead into the stretch and turned away all challenges down
the lane to prevail. SEA DOG was pushed to get position early but was caught three to four wide into the clubhouse turn, tracked just off the pace down the
backstretch, was set down from the three furlong pole, came into the stretch four wide, chased IT'S THIEVERY down the stretch under strong handling, was
gradually gaining ground approaching the wire but came up short. AZURE STAR (IRE) got away well and secured the rail and a slight lead going into the
first turn, set moderate fractions while being shadowed and occasionally pressed by IT'S THIEVERY to the outside, held the lead into the far turn then was
overtaken by that rival passing the three furlong pole, fought back under strong handling down the stretch but was outfinished in the end. WELLSWORT
(IRE) reserved near the rear of the tight field but not far off the pace, kept on trying under steady handling but could not find the needed response and
finished evenly. TOUCH OF ZEN raced near the rear of the compact field, remained close to the stretch, hand little to offer late and was never a threat. This
race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
DUTTON STREET GIRL hopped at the start and was away a bit slowly, was allowed to settle in the early running, saved ground into the turn and loomed
nearing the quarter pole, took command into upper stretch and shook free at the furlong marker, drew away into the final sixteenth, felt mild pressure from
the oncoming runner-up in deep stretch and maintained a clear lead to the finish while drifting out some in the final stages. CHOKECHERY SHARI stumbled
leaving the start and was off a bit slowly, was allowed to settle away from the start, raced widest into the turn and gained while four to five wide nearing the
quarter marker, was widest into the stretch and ran evenly while in pursuit approaching the furlong pole, closed past mid-stretch, could not reel in the winner
in the final sixteenth and was second best. CLASSY DOE a step slow leaving the start, was hustled in the early stages and rushed up to contest the decent
early pace, pressed the pace three wide into the turn and vied for the lead at the quarter pole, took a narrow lead into upper stretch, was overtaken by
DUTTON STREET GIRL and chased the winner to the furlong marker, could not keep pace past mid-stretch, yielded in the final sixteenth and held for third
at the finish. A CLEAR BEHEST broke alertly, assumed command and dictated terms in the early stages, was confronted by CLASSY DOE heading to the
half-mile marker and disputed the pace inside of that rival approaching the turn, contested the moderate pace heading to the quarter pole, vied for the lead
between rivals into upper stretch, chased to the furlong marker, weakened past mid-stretch and was outfinished for third. SURF STAR was forwardly placed
away from the start, chased the decent early pace from the inside, was well placed into the turn and gained while two to three wide nearing the quarter pole,
was outrun into the stretch and faltered in the final stages. RETINA VIBRATING was prominent leaving the start, chased the decent early pace from the
outside, raced three to four wide into the turn and lost ground nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.
This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
HOT JAMMIES broke a step slowly leaving the start, rushed up and gained early command, set a decent pace heading to the half-mile marker, dictated
terms while off of the rail entering the turn, was well handled along the bend and set moderate fractions nearing the quarter pole, drew to a clear lead into
the stretch, felt pressure from the oncoming runner-up into the final sixteenth and held safely in a drive at the finish. TOM'S TREASURE broke alertly and
assumed command away from the start, ceded the early lead to HOT JAMMIES and stalked that runner through decent fractions heading to the half-mile
marker, was guided three wide into the turn and chased HOT JAMMIES nearing the quarter pole, was repelled into upper stretch and lost ground at the
furlong marker, re-rallied past mid-stretch, was able to pressure HOT JAMMIES in the final sixteenth but could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and was
second best. HAKUHIA tracked the decent early pace from between rivals, saved ground into the turn and chased the pace heading to the quarter pole, split
rivals into upper stretch and angled out for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, found her best stride late and was well clear in the end for third. MAGGIE'S
FAYE was forwardly placed away from the start, chased the decent early pace from between rivals and was well placed approaching the turn, ran in pursuit
three then two wide nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. ARA chased the decent early pace
from between rivals and a bit in tight, was guided three wide into the turn and improved position nearing the quarter pole, lacked a response into upper
stretch and tired in the final furlong. TOBACCO HONEY a bit fractious in the gate, was forwardly placed leaving the start and chased the decent early pace
from the outside, was guided four wide into the turn and ran in pursuit along the bend, lost position at the quarter marker and went widest into the stretch,
could not keep pace nearing the furlong pole and faltered in the late stages. BEVERLY T away in good order leaving the start, tracked the early pace from
the inside, saved ground into the turn and was outrun to the quarter marker, trailed into the stretch and could not muster a late response. This race was
originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
GETAWAY CHARM broke well and raced close up through the early stages, stayed out in the three to four path in the clear down the backstretch and
through the turn, made a bid at the quarter pole as the outsider of four horses fanned across the track at the three-sixteenths pole, wore down the
challengers in the stretch and was pulling clear in the end. SAHARA SUE broke inward at the start and was last away, made steady forward progress during
the run down the backstretch, plotted a path through the turn to set up a late run, tipped out to the five path in the stretch and produced a good finish to get
up for the place. BOBBY'S GENIE broke well and was up on the pace in the early going though a bit rank, sat in a stalking position to the turn, then moved
to challenge for the lead near the five-sixteenths marker, was between four horses across the track turning for home, battled gamely to deep stretch, was
outfinished in the final yards but able to hold third. TIGERIZE broke well and pressed the pacesetter from the inside, dropped back a little on the turn then
went into a drive, waited for some room approaching the five-sixteenths pole, went willingly through an opening on the rail turning for home, finished up well
under steady handling and intermittent urging but was not enough. BLURSDAY bobbled at the break and was last down the backstretch, angled over to the
rail for the run through the turn then swung out to the eight path for the stretch run, finished well under handling but had too much ground to make up.
JULIET'S KITCHEN broke well but struggled to maintain contact with the field, was under a ride from the half-mile pole, dropped well behind the rest but
kept to task and managed to pass one in the final furlong. EM N HOLL'S FIESTA broke well and made the lead without much pressure, led the field to the
turn under some restraint with TIGERIZE pressing the issue to the inside from the start and BOBBY'S GENIE putting added pressure through the turn, was
surrounded by the quarter pole, held on between horses turning for home then faltered in mid-stretch and dropped back to last. This race was originally
hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

LITTLE LADY LOU sent leaving the start, was forwardly placed in the early running and stalked the solid pace heading to the half-mile marker, gained
ground approaching the turn and pressed LADY WOLF from the outside nearing the quarter pole, gained command into upper stretch and led to the furlong
pole, dug in while keeping the runner-up at bay into the final sixteenth and held in a drive in deep stretch for a determined win. ZAFFERANA broke alertly,
ceded the early lead and rated off of the solid pace heading to the half-mile marker, was guided two wide and between rivals into the turn, shifted three wide
nearing the quarter marker and loomed approaching the top of the stretch, chased LITTLE LADY LOU to the furlong marker, was kept at bay into the final
sixteenth and was second best in the end. WARREN'S WILD RIDE settled off of the solid early pace, gained ground into the turn and chased three to four
wide nearing the quarter marker, split rivals into the stretch and continued her bid at the furlong marker, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and held well
for show honors at the finish. KEEPYOURPRANCEON was bothered at the start and was away slowly from the gate, recovered and settled off of the solid
early pace, raced two wide into the turn and gained ground nearing the quarter marker, split rivals into upper stretch and continued her rally at the furlong
marker, flattened out in the final sixteenth and just missed for third at the finish. LADY WOLF hustled away from the start, assumed early command and set
a quick pace heading to the half-mile marker, showed the way into the turn then was pressed to the quarter marker by LITTLE LADY LOU, was overtaken
into the stretch and faded in the final furlong. OH ANGEL broke awkwardly, bothered a neighboring rival and spotted the field to begin, trailed to the half-mile
marker, saved ground into the turn and advanced nearing the quarter marker, swung widest into the stretch and continued her bid at mid-stretch, could not
sustain her run into the final sixteenth and passed a tired rival in deep stretch. DIVINE PASSAGE was forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the solid
early pace from the outside and was guided three to four wide into the turn, gained ground along the bend and raced within aim nearing the quarter marker,
lost ground into the stretch and gave way in the final stages. SWEET MILLIE was prominent away from the start, chased the solid early pace from the inside
and was well placed heading into the turn, saved ground into the bend and lost position at the quarter pole, was outrun into the stretch and tired in the final
furlong. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
OH GREAT (IRE) hustled away from the start, assumed command into the first turn and showed the way into the backstretch run, set moderate fractions
while well handled heading to the half-mile, dictated terms off of the rail into the far turn and came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, repelled
EFFECTIVE GIG into upper stretch and kicked clear at the furlong marker, was kept to task while clear into the final sixteenth and was geared down in deep
stretch to be a convincing winner. GALLANT WARREN broke a step slowly leaving the start, was allowed to settle in the early going and was guided two to
three wide into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run, went outside of rivals into the far turn and gained ground four to five wide nearing
the quarter marker, ran evenly into the stretch then rallied into the final sixteenth, could not impact the winner in deep stretch and held for second at the
finish. WALKING BOSS unhurried away from the start, saved ground into the first turn and was content to trail heading to the half-mile marker, was guided
two to three wide into the far turn, swung widest for the stretch drive and made a mild gain at the furlong marker, closed willingly in the final sixteenth and
was clear in the end for third. EFFECTIVE GIG broke alertly, ceded the early lead to OH GREAT and stalked that rival from between runners into the first
turn, kept close attendance to the moderate pace through the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid and challenged OH GREAT at the quarter marker,
was repelled in that effort and chased OH GREAT to mid-stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. JERRY JEFF
WALKER was prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace while three to four wide and between runners into the first turn, took back entering the
backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace approaching the half-mile, chased three wide into the far turn, was outkicked into the stretch and did not
offer a final response. LYING GHOST was hustled away from the start and was forwardly placed approaching the first turn, settled just off of the early pace
and tracked three to four wide into the backstretch run, chased the moderate pace approaching the half-mile marker, was guided three to four wide into the
second turn, could not muster a response in the stretch drive and did not threaten in the late stages. POUR ON THE COLE tracked the moderate pace from
the second flight, improved position into the backstretch run and was well placed nearing the half-mile marker, chased two wide into the far turn, could not
keep pace into the stretch and gave way in the late stages. CHIEF JACKSON was forwardly placed leaving the start, stalked the early pace from a four to
five wide path into the first turn, chased the moderate pace while widest entering the backstretch run and was well placed at the half-mile marker, ran in
pursuit four wide into the far turn and lost ground at the quarter pole, could not keep pace into upper stretch and tired in the final furlong. This race was
originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
