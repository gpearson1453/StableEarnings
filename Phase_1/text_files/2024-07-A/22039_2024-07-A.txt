horses, challenged three deep near the quarter pole and kept on willingly to the wire. JACKMAN dueled from the inside of foe and faltered the final sixteenth
of a mile. DOUBLE EDGE SWORD was off a step slow, had an inside around the far turn through the stretch and was even with closing bid. GROUP HUG
dropped back early on, was four wide near the quarter pole, raced from the far outside in the stretch and never was a factor. EASY DAY raced five wide
around the far turn and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
LITTLE CRYBABY dropped back early on, moved up three to five wide around the far turn, raced from the far outside in the stretch run and surged up late
under strong handling. GETTOTHSTORYIMDONE vied for the early lead from the outside of rivals, cleared off inside the eighth pole and was caught near
the wire to just miss. BIG BOLT raced mid pack early on, made a three to four wide bid and finished willingly to the wire. WICKED KITTEN was under a hard
chase from the outside of rivals and weakened in the latter stages. BEST WORST IDEA vied for the early lead between rivals and weakened the final eighth
of a mile. LUCKY IN LOVE was squeezed back at the start, raced two deep near the five sixteenths pole, swung six wide into the lane and never was a
serious threat. NEVER MORE VALOR dropped back to race mid pack, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no response. CITY KISS vied
for the early lead near the inside and gave way. DON'T ANNOY ME urged from the inside early on, angled out into the lane and tired. HOME TOWN FAV
raced five wide around the far turn and lacked a bid. LOU'S IRISH LADY broke awkwardly, raced off the early going after the poor start and never menaced.
This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
AUTO GLIDE settled off the early going while racing in hand, ridden into the far turn, raced three wide near the quarter pole, shifted six wide into the upper
stretch to take aim, raced from the outside of a drifting Shaft's Bullet and Movisitor, dug in and just got up under strong handling. SHAFT'S BULLET rated
along under a firm hold, dug in between while drifting deep stretch and missed in a game effort. MOVISITOR was sent to a clear early lead, continued its
clear lead inside the eighth pole, drifted out late and kept on gamely to the wire. MAGIC MICHAEL settled off the pace, had and inside run around the far
turn through the stretch and had no final winning bid. IRISH CORK unhurried early on, raced three to four wide around the far turn and lacked a sollid bid.
SLIP MAHONEY tracked the early leader from the outside, was done early and eased up on through the stretch.

Footnotes
NIGHT CAP settled back off the early pace racing in hand, moved up from the inside around the far turn, angled out near the eighth pole and finished
strongly to edge clear under steady pressure. LATE FROST prompt the early pace setter from the inside, angled out through the upper stretch to take aim
and kept on gamely to the wire. JERSEY PEARL raced mid pack early on, ridden two deep near the quarter pole, shifted out six wide and moved up late to
improve position. GOODGIRL BADHABITS set all the pace from the inside, was headed inside the eighth pole and faltered late. OLIVIA DARLING bobbled
at the start, quickly recovered to ease up from the inside to track the pace, continued its inside run past the quarter pole and weakened through the drive.
FEE drafted off the early pace setters, was five wide around the far turn, raced from the far outside in the stretch and had no late rally. RED HOT MESS was
unhurried early on, raced four wide around the far turn and had no response. BEGUINE stalked the pace, raced four wide near the quarter pole and was
empty. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
WAR LIKE GODDESS was a bit reluctant to load, settled off the early going racing in hand, asked through the far turn, raced four deep into the upper
stretch and finished strongly to edge up under steady encouragement. CHOP CHOP prompt the early leader from the outside, led into the upper stretch,
dug in near the eighth pole and kept on gamely to the wire. VERGARA tracked the early pace setters just off the inside, moved up three wide into the upper
stretch to take aim, split rivals near the eighth, shifted in a bit and finished gamely to the wire. ATOMIC BLONDE (GER) settled off the early pace setters,
ridden along near the quarter pole from the inside, angled out into the upper stretch to race five wide and closed in mildly. LA MEHANA (FR) stumbled at the
break, rated under a firm hold near the rail and weakened through the drive. ALPHA BELLA showed good early foot to control the early pace and weakened
the final eighth of a mile.

HONOR D LADY was bumped at the break, then was well rated and moved off the inside, made a three wide bid by the three eighths marker and shook
clear by the five sixteenths, then was sent down leaving the turn and responded well, then was given a pop by the furlong marker and then a few more to
the sixteenth marker while drawing off the prove much the best. SADDLE UP JESSIE was bumped at the break, then was under a hard hold two wide, then
was coaxed along by the three eighths marker, moved out and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole to loom boldly leaving the quarter pole but
flattened out while staying on for the place award. WET PAINT was reserved two wide early, then was ridden along by the three eighths marker while
trailing, moved out and then swung out five wide leaving the bend and had a belated rally to gain the show award. QUEEN OF MISSOULA was bumped
slightly at the break, then settled along the rail, saved ground on the turn and was coaxed along by the five sixteenths and cut the corner leaving the turn but
lacked the needed winning bid. MORNING MATCHA was reserved three wide into the first turn, then advanced outside of horses on the turn and came four
wide off the bend but lacked a rally. ABUNDANCIA set the pace while clear and getting over to the inside, then was headed by the three eights and gave
way. MALIBU BEAUTY broke outwardly at the start bumping HONOR D LADY, then stalked the pace setter two wide, made a bid between rivals by the
three eights marker and then then tired.

BIG TONE C broke sharp, in total control around the bend, kept to task in upper stretch, kicked clear under the wire. STORM CAT EYES tracked the pace
three wide into the turn, under aggressive handling picked up the tempo nearing the quarter pole, finished second best to runaway winner. I WANNA ROCK
raced up close and along the inside, settled back and angled off the inside nearing the quarter pole, came up empty late. GOLD DILEMMA slow start,
chased into the turn, never threatened. AWESOME FRIEND slow away from the gate, trailed into the turn, was eased leaving the three eighths pole,
