Footnotes
GRAFT stalked the pace in the three path down the backstretch, moved up three wide leaving the far turn, secured command in upper stretch and drew off
under urging. ROCK BULLET stayed along the inner rail on the far turn, moved out to the three path in upper stretch and rallied between horses.
ELFUEGOMASBRILANTE , four deep leaving the backstretch, circled horses on the far turn, was in the four path in upper stretch and rallied outside.
OXFORD UNION lacked speed, saved ground on the turns, swung four wide in upper stretch and passed tired horses. SIN PERMISO rushed up four wide
entering the first turn, moved to the inner rail after going clear entering the backstretch, set the pace to upper stretch then faded. BAND TOUR chased the
pace outside SIN PERMISO and weakened in upper stretch. CUNDI , four wide the far turn, was not a factor. SOMETIMES I DO chased the pace along the
inner rail, faltered and was eased. COLONIAL PARKWAY , pinched back leaving the starting gate trailed.

Footnotes
SHEHERHERS , perched three wide off the duelers into the turn, moved up and engaged REMEMBER ME from her outside leaving the five sixteenths,
sparred into the lane, gained a slim advantage in mid stretch, kept on under left handed asking while battling inside the sixteenth pole then edged clear at
the wire. REMEMBER ME was nudged clear soon after the break then dropped in to secure the rail, was joined by an outer rival near the five eighths,
dueled, briefly went clear past the three eighths, dug in when confronted by the winner heading to the quarter pole, stayed on gamely after being headed a
furlong from home then gave way grudgingly through the final strides. TINA TINA TINA , off the duelers while saving ground, angled out bothering
CLOSERTOTHEHEART near the quarter pole, straightened away in upper stretch and closed steadily. G'S FIREBALL leaned inward and then bobbled after
hitting the gate, regrouped to race off the pace three deep, came four wide for the drive but lacked a rally. CLOSERTOTHEHEART broke sluggishly, raced
off the pace and between runners, checked when impeded by TINA TINA TINA near the quarter pole then came up empty. KAPADOKYA broke awkwardly,
corrected and bid outside REMEMBER ME near the five eighths, dueled to about the three eighths then weakened. Following an objection by the rider of
CLOSERTOTHEHEART, TINA TINA TINA was disqualified from third and placed fifth for causing interference near the quarter pole. An objection by the
rider of CLOSERTOTHEHEART against G'S FIREBALL alleging interference near the quarter pole was not allowed.

Footnotes
HOT LOOKIN ROYAL broke a step slow, edged up four deep nearing the half, chased three deep near the five sixteenths, shifted in a bit with progress into
the lane, altered back out leaving the furlong grounds, surged under right handed asks to take over inside the sixteenth pole and drew out. PROPER
ATTIRE broke inward, corrected and was hustled clear, set the pace towards the inside and under a bit of rating, widened her advantage past the five
sixteenths, came under a drive inside the three sixteenths, failed to contain the winner and weakened late. PREPAREFORTAKEOFF , inside of trio while
chasing early, steadied back off foes mid turn, angled out four wide for the drive and was able to have enough to nab the show. TIMEISGOLDEN , two wide
between foes early, raced as the closest pursuer past the three eighths, stayed willingly to about mid stretch then faded. MARTHA'S BANNER , three wide
between rivals early, failed to go on under a ride leaving the far turn and retreated.

SUNFLOWER STATE , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, advanced outside horses to wrest command inside the eighth pole then drew off under
steady handling. SPEEDY ALEX remained along the inner rail around the turn while well off the pace, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied on
his left lead. FEAR NOTHING bumped ECLIPTICAL ZIP when bearing in at the break, saved ground on the turn, eased out to the three path for the drive
and lacked the needed rally. UP IN FLAMES disputed the pace outside BLESSED CANDY and gave way inside the eighth pole. ANOTHERHOPE , four
deep around the turn, drifted in near the eighth pole and failed to rally. BLESSED CANDY showed speed along the inner rail, dueled to mid stretch and gave
way. ECLIPTICAL ZIP , bumped leaving the starting gate, trailed and was eased late.

Footnotes
KAKE'S ARROW showed speed then was rated back between rivals in the opening furlong, settled nicely off the inside through the backstretch run, gained
in hand then bid outside the leader leaving the five sixteenths, was roused clear soon into the lane, kept on under solid handling past the furlong grounds
and kept CAP'N DUSTY at bay. CAP'N DUSTY , well placed saving ground under rating, edged up leaving the far turn, angled out for room approaching the
stretch, had aim on the winner from the three sixteenths, gave valiant chase from there but wasn't quite good enough. STARLIFTER , off last when in a bit
tight, regrouped and settled well off the inside, advanced five wide outside rivals approaching the lane and churned oin. BLIND EYE rated off the inside,
gained four wide and to the inside of a rival near the quarter pole, chased in upper stretch but came up empty through the final furlong. MR FLOWERS , hit
the outer portion of the gate, corrected and rushed up outside rivals to clear, opened up when refusing to rate around the first turn, settled better through the
backstretch run while towards the inside, was joined past the five sixteenths, stayed on to about mid stretch then weakened. GHOSTLY LEO was rated back
from between horses soon after the break, settled well back while saving ground, swung four to five wide for the drive and offered a mild response. NO
FOOLIN MO saved ground, moved up past the half, chased when getting through along the rail past the five sixteenths, failed to sustain leaving the three
sixteenths and faded. TRUE CONNECTION drafted back to be well off the early pace, saved ground into the lane but failed to drum up a serious run. SIG ,
firmly rated back off the leader soon after the start, jump tracks heading to the first turn, recovered to stalk, took closer order about two wide into the far turn,
chased, checked when in close near the quarter pole and weakened.

Footnotes
GOODBYE NOTE broke inward bumping TOAST TO COAST, corrected and took command, was joined from his outside by STAR SHOPPING nearing the
backstretch, rated kindly handling the pressure, edged clear of that one past the three eighths then was joined by STELLAR LUTE with a quarter to go,
repelled that one and was roused clear in upper stretch, kept on under solid handling past the sixteenth pole and proved resolute to the wire. STELLAR
LUTE , three to four wide, edged up past the half, moved to threaten the winner approaching the stretch, could not quite match strides through the lane but
stayed on gamely to the wire. BLAME THE TUX , bumped at the break, was taken to rate off the pace, was lightly steadied near the three eighths, angled
out, circled four wide into the stretch and closed steadily. SNEAKING SUSPICION was rated back from between runners early, gained three wide leaving
the three eighths, chased but lacked the needed finish. GOD IS LOVE , three then two wide between foes, had aim into the far turn and faded. TOAST TO
COAST , bumped and in tight at the break, recovered and moved up to stalk while saving ground, failed to keep pace while ridden along past the three
eighths then tired. STAR SHOPPING , used four wide outside rivals to reach contention into the first turn, dropped in a bit and pressed outside the winner,
failed to kick on leaving the five sixteenths and weakened. MODERN ERA lagged back and failed to generate a run. IN THE DANCE , bumped and in close
at the start, regrouped and raced off the pace, was under a ride leaving the far turn, lost his action near the five sixteenths, was taken wide in upper stretch
then was eased through the final furlong. There was a stewards' inquiry into IN THE DANCE'S run around the final turn. No action was deemed necessary
