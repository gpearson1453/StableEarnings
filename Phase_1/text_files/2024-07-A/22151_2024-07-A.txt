Footnotes
SUNDAY BLING drifted outwardly at the start then went head to head to with an outer foe into the turn, was confronted by two more outer foes while leading
the way by a head in the upper stretch and held on well down the lane to prevail while in an all out drive. STELLAR TAP saved ground while racing towards
the rear of the pack, remained well on the turn before closing belatedly down the lane while closing in on the leader. MONGOLIAN BEE brushed foe at the
start, then pressed the leading pair while three wide, dug in gamely leaving the bend in attempt to overtake SUNDAY BLING, lacked the winning bid and
bested the rest. BLING BLING BLING raced mid pack while five wide, inched up on the turn to contend for the lead with inner foes in the early stretch, could
not overpower SUNDAY BLING and gave way. PRIZELESS pursued the pace while three wide, continued to saved ground on the turn towards the back,
swung six wide and rallied a mild bid in the late stretch to no avail. MY LITTLE PRINCE stalked the pace while four wide, then rallied a mild bid in the upper
stretch and did not respond. CINCO STEVE brushed outer foe at the start, then dueled with an inner foe into the turn while in a hard drive, could not retain
bid and flattened out. PLAY RULE chased the pace from the inside, was in a mild drive on the turn and did not fire in the stretch. HARD GOLD trailed early
and was no menace. AFFLUENT GENTLEMAN was reluctant to load and no menace. WHOOPING JAY chased the pace while two wide while in a steady
hand ride and did no rally in the stretch.

Footnotes
GHURAIR'S WARRIOR pursued the leading trio while two wide and while being nicely rated in the early stages, dug in gamely in the upper stretch and
edged past the dueling pair to be up in the final strides. SLEW SKIES was fractious prior to the start, then broke inwardly and bumped foe, led the way into
the first turn, was confronted by two outer foes to vie down the backstretch and into the far turn, pulled away to go head to head with KERAUNOS then was
out finished by GHURAIR'S WARRIOR in the final yards. KERAUNOS moved up from the four path to battle with inner rivals down the backstretch and into
the far turn, was in a gamely rally to pull away and spar with an inner foe before being finished by GHURAIR'S WARRIOR. GWYNETH'S MALIBU moved
from the inside before checking up sharply leaving the first turn, was allowed to settle in the middle duo, came under coaxing leaving the far turn while three
wide, then rallied bid in the late stretch but it was not enough. TIGER MAN MCKOOL raced mid pack while two wide, then moved up to the second flight in
the late backstretch, rallied a brief bid while four wide on the far turn and into the early stretch before giving way. SIR LANCELOT RIDGE was unhurried
early, continued to race towards the back of the pack on the far turn before rallying a mild bid in the late stretch but it was too late. LEXINGTON RIVER was
forwardly placed into the first turn to battle between rivals down the backstretch and into the far turn, was in a hard drive then gave way in the late stretch.
YOU TIME chased the pace while three wide, was in a mild drive throughout the far turn and lacked rallying in the stretch. MUSTBELIEVE was bumped at
the start and failed to rally. PEARSE was off slowly and was no menace. BOSTON ROSCOE pursued the pace from the inside, steadied off heels in the
early backstretch, regained stride and continued to chase while in a mild drive then flattened out in the home stretch. GOOD DOCTRINE was fractious in the
gate and no factor.

FIRE VISION showed the way from the inside, cleared a pressing rival in the early stretch, was in an all out drive and lasted to the wire determinedly. TIZ
MAGIC saved ground close behind the pack, then moved up on the turn while three wide, rallied in the early stretch and was closing in the leader and hung
at the wire. REPASADO unseated rider prior to the start, then was away well to chase the pace between rivals, rallied bid leaving the bend, shifted outward
in the late stretch and kept on to get up for the show prizes. TENNESSEE MOON chased the pace while three wide, then moved up on the turn to press the
leader while two wide, could not gain the lead and gave way in the late stretch. SHE SPEAKS chased the pace from the inside while in a hand ride, then bid
in the late stretch and lacked the needed response. CAPETOWN CANDY was no factor.

CLOSING ACT was coaxed between rivals to move up along the rail and take the lead from UPTOWNBLINGITHOME at the half, was met with said rival at
the top of turn to duel briefly before assuming command in the upper stretch then held on well while in an all out drive to prevail. RECLUSIVE raced in the
back trio while saving ground, then came out four to five wide leaving the bend to close belatedly down the lane and hung at the wire. IZATIZ broke
outwardly and bumped foe, then chased the pace from the inside, was encouraged leaving the bend and was closing in on the leader while in a gamely bid
and hung third. UPTOWNBLINGITHOME led the way briefly while four wide, then stalked the emerging leader into the turn while two wide, moved up to duel
briefly before giving way in the stretch. SUCCESSFULPATH chased the pace while three wide, was urging on the turn, came out four wide in the upper
stretch to rally a mild bid and came up empty. BLUSHING BELLE pursued the pace while two wide and between rivals, then rallied bid on the turn and kept
on down the lane while in a mild drive to no avail. TOO MUCH KIKI drifted outwardly at the start and was no menace. PEEK FACTOR was bumped at the
start and no factor.

MOR VICTORY showed the way from the inside, was pressured by outer foes on the far turn, remained unbothered then was asked in the upper stretch to
draw off and claim victory one more time. BOBBY BRINKLEY saved ground while racing three wide mid pack in the early stages, then rallied bid on the far
turn, came out four wide in the upper stretch, was bumped by an inner foe but kept on down the lane to get up for the place prize.
SUPERSECRETWEAPON was bumped at the start then stalked the pace while two wide, came under coaxing leaving the far turn to rally bid in the early
stretch, could not overcome the leader and gave way and held onto the show winnings. SPECIAL MEMORY tracked the pace while two wide early, then
moved up three wide to urge steadily on the far turn, rallied a brief bid in the upper stretch then gave way. VICTORY FOR VETS was brushed at the start,
raced mid pack while two wide in the early stages, rallied bid on the far turn, drifted out four wide and bumped foe then gave way. BANDERA BLING was no
threat. NIGHTWIND tracked the pace from the inside, was in a long drive on the far turn to rally a mild bid in the upper stretch then stopped. STANS HOME
RUN broke inwardly and bumped foe and was no factor. IBERIAN RUNNER was no rally.

Footnotes
SECRET FAITH laid off the pace while four wide, then moved up meticulously on the turn to edge past the battling trio in the early stretch, gained command
and held on well to prevail. TAPITURES ACTOR pursued the pace while three deep, remained well rated on the turn, angled out five wide in the late stretch,
rallied bid to gain second position while pursuit of SECRET FAITH and was second best. TEQUILA KISS stalked the pace while two wide, then battled
between rivals on the turn and into the early stretch, was in an all out drive to gain command briefly at the eighth pole then was out finished by SECRET
FAITH and held onto the show winnings. CAFE AU LAIT chased the pace between rivals into the turn, then rallied a mild bid in the early stretch and needed
more. QUINQUELA veered inwardly at the start, then stalked the pace while three wide, moved up to vie with inner foes on the turn and into the early
stretch then gave way grudgingly. TICKET TO BROADWAY was no menace. I'M ON EDGE chased from the inside, was asked leaving the turn then lacked
rallying in the stretch. LASKO LADY was cut off at the start and lost the chance of contending. GOLDEN COLE showed the way from the inside, then battled
with outer foes leaving the turn, was hard used and tired in the late stretch.

Footnotes
IMALUCKYCHARM showed the way from the inside, then sparred with RUN WITT RUN down the backstretch and into the far turn, then pulled away
heading into the early stretch and lasted to the wire while being pursued by stablemate to prove best. NO MAS TEQUILA broke outwardly then tracked the
pace from the inside while being well rated in the early stages, rallied bid leaving the far turn and was closing in on IMALUCKYCHARM and hung at the
wire. BLOOD ORANGE was reserved along the rail while racing in the third flight of rivals, then urged steadily on the far turn, fanned out five wide and
closed well for the show winnings besting the rest of the field. SKY ROCKER was allowed to settle while four wide in the third flight of rivals down the
backstretch, was gaining ground on the far turn, rallied a gamely bid in the early stretch then was out finished for the show prize. MISSINGYOUCRAZY
tracked the pace while two wide, was in a long drive on the far turn, rallied bid in the early stretch and lacked the needed response. TEXAS MOON was
unhurried early then rallied too little too late in the stretch and never threatened. RUN WITT RUN was reluctant to load, then broke outwardly, moved up
from the three path to duel with IMALUCKYCHARM down the backstretch, was in a hard drive on the far turn, could not retain bid and tired in the stretch.
WILBURNSCLASSYLADY was impeded at the start and was no threat. TUDELA tracked the pace while three wide, was in a steady drive on the far turn,
lacked bid and flattened out in the stretch. BLUE HEAVENLY was pinched back at the start and was no factor. BRADEE CASH was no menace. REASON
OVER RICHES failed to rally.
