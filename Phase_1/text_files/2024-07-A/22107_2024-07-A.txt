Footnotes
EMPTY TOMB went to the front, raced inside on the first turn, showed the way while inside of a foe, vied in the two path on the far turn, responded well
when asked near the quarter-pole, shook clear in upper stretch, came under a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker and held under strong urging.
ROCCO STRONG was caught five wide on the first turn, settled outside while tracking the leader, was urged along passing the five-eighths pole, chased in
the four path on the far turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and willingly earned the place. HIGHER QUALITY settled on the inside, was
roused on the far turn, came off the rail under a drive in upper stretch, pursued the winner to the finish and just missed the place while able to get the show.
ACCIDENTAL HERO stumbled at the start but broke with the field, went around the first turn in the two path, was well placed just off the pace, came under
urging in the two path on the far turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and was out-kicked. PEOPLE FORCE broke out then was hustled,
raced in the four path on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the far turn, was given his cue near the five-sixteenths
pole, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch, chased that foe into the final furlong then dropped back before moving out and weakened.
BOSSMAKINBOSSMOVES moved in into the first turn, went three wide on that bend, settled towards the back, was urged along in the two path for most of
the far turn, shifted three then four wide late on that bend, came six wide into the stretch and improved position without threatening. BOLD VICTORY saved
ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged while inside for most of the far turn then moved to the two path, came four wide into the stretch then
angled further out and failed to threaten. GUT FEELING was hustled from the gate, went six then five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was
urged four wide on the far turn, spun seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. I AM THE LAW raced between foes in the two path on the first turn,
settled off the pace, came under urging near the nine-sixteenths pole, went two to three wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch under the crop
and was no factor.

Footnotes
AMANDA'S FOLLY bobbled at the break, raced just off the inside through the first turn and had a set of ear plugs taken off his mount in the gate dangling
from his pants in behind, tipped out four paths off the inside down the backstretch, came under coaxing four wide nearing the quarter pole and swung three
to four wide into upper stretch, took over command straightened away and drew clear under a drive, then got geared down in the late stages. TONED UP
along the inside through the first turn, chased four to five wide down the backstretch and through the far turn under coaxing from the three-eighths,
continued four to five wide for home, proved no match for the top one while along for the place honors. SWEETEST PRINCESS bobbled brushing the off
side stall at the start, showed the way a bit headstrong briefly past the stands the first time before heading along the inside into the first turn, showed the
way in hand along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths when under challenge for the initial time, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch under threat, got displaced straightened away into upper stretch and weakened.

PUNCH THE CLOCK moved up after the break and displayed early speed, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, dropped from the two path to the rail
early on the turn, shook clear under urging into upper stretch then was put to a left-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths pole, extended the advantage
into the final furlong and proved much the best while drifting out some under a strong hand-ride to the finish. LA DECENTE was urged along off the pace,
went four wide for most of the turn then moved to the five path, gained seven wide into the stretch, passed foes under a drive before the furlong marker and
willingly earned the place. GOING FOR GLORY made light contact with a foe at the start, was urged along at the rear, went five wide on the turn, came six
wide into the stretch, was carried out outside the furlong marker and improved for the show. MIA NIPOTINA bumped lightly with a rival at the start, was
urged near the rear, raced in hand while off heels leaving the backstretch, moved from the rail to the two path early on the turn, spun three wide into the
stretch then drifted out significantly and improved for the last spot in the superfecta. NEIGH JUDE was urged along off the pace, dropped from the two path
to the rail early on the turn and lacked the needed response. OUR REWARD was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, moved from the rail
to the three path on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch under the crop and tired. DREAMING OF CARLI was urged along towards the front, went
three then four wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and came up empty. OUTTA THE CLOUD was hustled from the gate then urged along off the
pace, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn and failed to threaten. NEEDED was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the outside of
the winner then in the three path on the turn and tired. WIDOW was urged along on the outside, moved in late on the backstretch, went four wide on the
turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. MISS MAXIMUS bobbled at the start, dropped back under urging, went two then three wide on the
turn and retreaated.

Footnotes
RUN FOR THE HILLS coaxed from the gate, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole, went seven wide into upper stretch, took over command just inside the three-sixteenths and edged clear under a drive
to prevail. LADY MILAGRO hustled from the gate, showed the way coaxed along the inside, came under a drive at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into
upper stretch, got collared just inside the three-sixteenths and ran on to secure the place honors. L STREET LADY coaxed from the start, chased just off the
inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. BUSTIN BAY coaxed
from the gate, chased four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, passed tired rivals. SHOOTOUTTHELIGHTS
a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, stumbled at the start conceding three lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased six paths off the inside
down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch, weakened
in the drive. SHOSHANAH stumbled to her knees at the start but only conceded at maximum a length to the front when quickly settling into stride with
forward momentum, chased three then two wide in closest aim of the leader early on, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and angled three to four
wide into upper stretch, then tired through to the finish.

Footnotes
BROWN EYED CAT was bumped then forced out at the start and off a bit slow, dropped well off the pace under urging, went around the turn in the two
path, came three wide into the stretch then quickly moved further out, rallied outside under a right-handed crop and closed strongly to get up in the final
sixteenth and prevail. CALL BOB broke very alertly then moved in quickly, dueled on the outside of an opponent then in the three path on the turn, dropped
to the two path late on that bend, shook clear into upper stretch, came under the crop outside the furlong marker, led to the sixteenth-pole then was
overtaken while well clear for the place. STORMY'S DREAMING was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, moved from the rail to the two
path on the turn and lacked the needed response while just up for the show. TOMACON bobbled slightly at the start, was urged along off the pace, went
around the turn in the three path, came four wide into the stretch and just missed the show. D C BOY'S was ridden along on the outside at the rear, went
three wide on the turn, dropped in a path while remaining on his inside lead in upper stretch and was no factor. ROMANTIC CHARMER broke out and
bumped solidly with a rival, chased the pace on the outside then in the four path on the turn, dropped back while remaining on his inside lead in upper
stretch, drifted out some near the furlong marker and tired. NEW YORK SCRAPPY rushed up to duel on the inside of a foe, vied in the two path for most of
the turn then moved to the rail, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated.

SELECTIVELY SWEET from the midway point on the turn patiently handled, swung three then two wide into upper stretch and was set down straightened
away, came under threat to the outside and dug in gamely dueling through the final furlong to the stretch to prevail by a neck on the wire. WILL NOT BE
SWAYED coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to duel
with the aforementioned foe through the final eighth in game fashion but was ultimately denied at the end while well clear of the rest. TECA coaxed from the
gate, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six wide
into upper stretch, never threatened the top pair while along safe and best of the rest for the show honors. SELECTIVELY SWEET vied from the three path
between foes down the backstretch, and then dueled from the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and weakened in the stretch. MY VANILLA got bumped and steadied at the start, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and
then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and coming inwards to force HONESTLY to steady off her heels, swung six wide
into upper stretch and tired. MY LADY BAE broke in at the start bumping and forcing a pair of rivals to steady out against pressure inside from EPISODE,
chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and tired. FLAMING GLORY got bumped between foes at the start, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went
seven wide into upper stretch and tired. HONESTLY coaxed from the gate, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then tucked
briefly four wide into the turn, got forced to steady off the heels of MY VANILLA and altered three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
four wide into upper stretch and tired. EPISODE broke out at the start bumping a pair of rivals against pressure outside from MY LADY BAE, and then
steadied out conceding three lengths to the front, strode green and rank facing kick back and was tipped six to seven paths off the rail down the backstretch,
bolted on the turn getting out towards the outside fence before coming back under correction to swing eight to nine wide into upper stretch well behind and
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SUNDAY GIRL pressed the pace on the outside of two foes, vied in the three then four path on the turn, drifted in while moving clear in upper stretch then
came under a left-handed crop, responded well in the final furlong and held under steady urging. WEEKEND RAGS was well placed just off the pace,
angled from the two path to the five path on the turn, chased the winner in the stretch and willingly earned the place. BANK ON ANNA settled on the
outside, was roused four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. SOLIB was
urged along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch then moved further out, drifted in outside the sixteenth-pole
and improved position without threatening. MZ BIG BUCKS was hustled from the gate then urged along at the rear, went three wide on the turn, came six
wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SPEIGHTFUL LILY tossed her head at the start but broke with the rest of the field, tracked the pace on the
outside, dropped back while lugging out from the five path to the seven path on the turn, bore out nine wide into the stretch and had nothing left. CONCERTI
stumbled at the start then was hustled, pressed the pace on the inside of two foes, vied inside for most of the turn then moved to the two path and
weakened. QUEENS DANCER went to the front, showed the way under pressure from both sides, vied between horses in the two then three path on the
turn and tired.

Footnotes
CRUSHED ICE raced two to three wide in closest aim of the leader, advanced to prompt the pace of that rival through the far turn coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, took over the front nearing the quarter pole and swung three wide into upper stretch, then edged clear to the finish kept to task. SPRING
MAGIC bobbled at the break, chased just off the inside before tucking inside half a mile from home, tipped to the two path placed to coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, kept on under a drive to chase the winner home while clear of the rest for the place honors. JUST
MUSIC took an awkward first step at the start, chased four then three wide coming under prolonged coaxing at the half mile pole, angled five wide into
upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. SILENT MELODY stumbled at the start pecking the ground, chased four wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened. MISS FASHIONISTA chased five then four wide coming under coaxing half a mile from
home, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, made no impact. GRAB THE GLORY coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside,
tucked inside half a mile from home and came under increasing pressure through the turn and yielded command nearing the quarter pole, took the inside
route into upper stretch and tired through to the finish while flashed the crop to the right side.

under tight restraint on the first turn, moved up outside the five-eighths pole to race just off the pace, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked near the
five-sixteenths pole, found room along the rail and gained to make a bid into upper stretch, took the lead into the final furlong and drew away under steady
urging. SALUTE THE STARS went around the first turn in the two path, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied in the two path on the far turn, was
asked outside the quarter-pole, battled between horses under a drive in upper stretch, fought with two foes into the final furlong and proved no match for the
winner while just able to get the place. FILM STAR bobbled at the start, went three wide on the first turn, disputed the pace on the outside, was asked in the
three path outside the quarter-pole, battled outside of two opponents under a drive into the final furlong and also proved no match for the winner then just
missed the place while able to get the show. BLAZING SEVENS rounded the first turn in the three path, settled on the inside of a rival, was roused four then
five wide on the far turn, pursued the leaders into the final furlong and just missed the trifecta. ARTORIUS saved ground on the first turn, was rated just off
the pace while off the rail on the backstretch, came under encouragement in the two path on the far turn, chased the leaders under a drive into the final
furlong and lacked the needed kick. ROCKET CAN traveled four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the four path on the far
turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong and tired. CLASSIC CATCH stumbled at the start, went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was
urged along late on the backstretch, went five then six wide on the far turn and failed to respond. UNTREATED was caught six wide early on the first turn,
dropped to the four then three path later on that bend, settled towards the rear, was urged while dropping from the two path to the rail early on the far turn
and was no factor. SIGNATOR went two then three wide for most of the first turn then moved to the five path, settled towards the rear, was urged along
passing the nine-sixteenths, went five wide on the far turn, drifted in outside the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. QUALITY CHIC bumped soundly with
a foe after the start then was hustled, went around the first turn in the two path, was well placed just off the pace, dropped back in the three path on the far

Footnotes
THE QUEENS M G five wide in aim of the front, advanced and tucked three wide through the turn vying for command and coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, took over command three-sixteenths from home, edged clear to inside the eighth pole and then had
some of that margin cut into late with the outcome in no doubt. SHERBINI two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths and advanced through the latter portion of the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors.
LONG NECK PAULA chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. CARMEN'S CANDY JAR chased four paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from three furlongs out, spun three wide into upper stretch, passed tired rivals.
AORAKI established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from a pair, had that pressure intensify
through the turn and vied inside a pair of rivals coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch clinging to command,
yielded with three-sixteenths to go and weakened to the finish. VIGGIEDAL fractious in the gate prior to the start, broke on top and then prompted the pace
three then two wide before vying through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three then two wide into upper stretch, weakened in the
drive. COMPLEXION grew fractious in the gate in four separate incidents leaping up each time and forcing the rider off twice, got backed out and examined
and reloaded in the gate, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.
DREAMGIRL chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, tired. WEST MEMORIAL chased
along the inside and then just off the inside before heading back to the rail through the turn, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, took the inside
route into upper stretch and tired. SLANG chased along the inside, grew choppy gaited down along the rail appearing to balk at first but then got placed to a
protective hold by the rider near the half mile pole and was steadily eased up before being pulled up near the midway point on the turn, got loose and ran off
sans rider and was apprehended near the seven furlong chute entrance and subsequently transported off the track by equine ambulance.
WHATINTHELITERAL grew fractious in the gate prior to the start, stumbled badly falling to her face at the start and lost the rider as a result, then got
apprehended by outrider and was walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
PARKWAY went four wide on the first turn, settled outside on the backstretch, ranged up four wide on the far turn, made a bid near the five-sixteenths pole,
took the lead in the five path into upper stretch then moved in while going clear and drew away under steady urging. ALWAYS BE SMART broke out and
was off a step slow, dropped from the six path to the three path on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged four then five wide on the far turn and earned
the place while no match for the winner. VINCITA saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was roused while dropping from the two path to
the rail on the far turn, moved back off the rail in upper stretch, raced between foes into the final sixteenth and lacked the needed response while able to get
the show. BOLT D'PLATA was hustled from the gate, dropped from the five path to the three path on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved closer near
the nine-sixteenths pole, chased three then four wide on the far turn and weakened then just missed the show. GET IT TO MATTHEW was hustled from the
start, dropped from the two path to the rail late on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked while inside on the far turn, lost the
advantage into upper stretch and gave way. SUGAR HOOK went three then two wide on the first turn, prompted the pace between horses, was asked in the
two path on the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. CAESAR'S GHOST lost his footing at the start, went four then three wide on the first turn,
tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the far turn then made a bid, dropped back in upper stretch and also tired. GHOST PRINCE
saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, came up empty along the rail on the far turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked
off.
