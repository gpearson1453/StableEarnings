Footnotes
LOVE ME TENDER sent along early, taken back to track near the rail, shifted out four wide into the upper stretch and finished well to draw clear under
strong handling. ZECA DIABO raced mid pack early, moved up from the inside around the far turn, continued its inside run in the stretch and rallied for the
place position. MR CLAUSE showed good early foot to set the early pace and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. RIVER RIDGE raced three wide
around the far turn, eased out six wide into the upper stretch and closed in mildly. ELVIS HIMSELF was squeezed back at the start, raced off the early going
after the poor start, fanned eight wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. MAINTAIN raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch
and had no response. TOUCHED UP broke in a tangle, trailed early on, raced wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. TAP YOUR HEART chased
the early pace, raced three wide around the far turn and faded. REBEL'S MEMORY raced four to five wide around the far turn and was empty in the drive.

Footnotes
BELLA CLEOPATRA was keen early under mild urging, drew off into the upper lane under a steady hand ride and was geared down the final sixteenth pole.
BAYTOWN BOUJEE was bumped at the start, raced along the inside around the far turn, angled out through the upper stretch and rallied gamely to the
wire. WATERING was off slowly, raced three wide around the far turn and kept on to the wire. SLANDEROUS was away alertly, sent to a clear early lead,
overtaken through the far turn and weakened. OK BY ME raced from the inside, clipped heel through the early going, continued its inside run and was even
in the stretch. AURORA'S MUSIC raced off the early pace, raced five wide around the far turn and had no response racing from the outside. AMERICAN
SELECT broke inward, raced five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. CAVALLA chased the pace from the inside and faded.

Footnotes
NAVANI was well rated on the inside, waited for room approaching the quarter pole, slipped through leaving the turn and shook clear by the furlong marker
and then drew away in the final furlong to prove best under a drive. GOOD ACCELEBRATE was settled early and made a four wide move nearing the
quarter pole, then could not go with the winner while gaining the place award late on the outside. REBEL CONSORT stalked the early pace and made a
three wide bid leaving the turn by the quarter pole but flattened out and losing the place award late in between rivals. TIZ RACE DAY set the pace on the
inside and came two wide off the bend and was headed by the quarter pole, could not go with he winner and was out-kicked for the place award.

INTEGRATION stalked the early pace three wide keeping NINEELEVENTURBO on the inside entering the first turn, then rated back three wide and made a
three wide move by the three eighths marker to vie for command off the turn, then was given a vigorous hand ride off the turn and took over and the was
given one pop right handed with the crop and drew off while being ridden out to the wire with speed to spare late. NINEELEVENTURBO stalked the early
pace on the inside by the wire the first time, then floated out on the first turn and then moved up three wide on the backstretch to prompt the pace, made a
bid with the winner by the three eighths marker to be in between rivals, then was to the inside of the winner of the turn but proved to be no match for the
winner while clearly second best. HAPPYISASHAPPYDOES set the pace on the inside and then was headed by the three eighths and gave way.

Footnotes
MOANAS POWER was sent along to a clear early lead, challenged through the upper lane and kicked clear under steady pressure. CHIEF LADY coaxed
along racing mid pack, raced from the inside around the far turn, shifted out four wide and finished gamely to the wire. APROPOS stalked the pace, raced
four wide into the upper stretch and kept on willingly to the wire. IMPLOSION was bumped at the start, raced five wide around the far turn and was even
late. CHARLOTTES ROAD urged three deep and weakened through the drive. THE AMAZING MIZZEN checked between near the three eighths pole,
raced six wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. MANITOULIN ISLAND was shuffled back at the break, raced from the inside into the upper
stretch and never threatened. ICE CUBE BABY raced from the far outside around the far turn through the stretch and never menaced.
