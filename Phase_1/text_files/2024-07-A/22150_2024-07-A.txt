Footnotes
MISSIONAIRE stalked the pace under confident handling outside COUNTRY CHARLIE down the backstretch, secured command in upper stretch and drew
off while kept under encouragement. WICKED SECRET , unhurried outside horses down the backstretch, advanced four deep leaving the far turn and
continued willingly. MONEY IN MOTION stalked the pace inside horses, was well placed in the two path entering the stretch and finished evenly. WIRED IN
, well positioned along the inner rail for six furlongs, swung to the four path in upper stretch and rallied mildly. UPSIDEDOWN MAN , four wide entering the
first turn, advanced three deep on the far turn and weakened. PENNY LOAFER , three wide the first turn, was outrun. COUNTRY CHARLIE , taken to the
inner rail entering the first turn, remained along the rail setting the pace to the stretch and faltered. CAVENDISH , checked in tight quarters entering the first
turn, was not a factor.

HOT DANCE stalked the embattled leaders three wide, was shoved along to hold a forward position mid turn, shifted five wide into the lane, reeled in
SHINING SPIRIT from his outside to take over near mid stretch then kicked clear under a drive. VINO FROM ERNIES , bumped inward at the break,
regrouped and settled outside a rival, edged closer two wide into the lane, churned on to the inside of SHINING SPIRIT in deep stretch and gained the
place. SHINING SPIRIT sped up to the inside of INTEL AGENT and poked a head in front after a furlong, was hounded by that one into and around the turn,
wandered outward a path or two soon into the lane, ceded to the winner leaving the three sixteenths and faded very late. MINIME broke inward and bumped
VINO FROM ERNIES, corrected and settled off the pace while saving ground, gained along the rail into the stretch, failed to kick on in mid stretch and
weakened. INTEL AGENT showed speed and led through the opening eighth, stayed on after being headed and pestered the leader from the outside, failed
to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and weakened.

Footnotes
SIMON'S CHOICE , away alertly, disputed the pace two wide outside a rival, moved clear under some coaxing past the five sixteenths, opened up a large
lead while under a hearty drive past mid stretch then cruised home while being flashed the whip the final sixty yards. A B C YA , urged along while off the
pace, worked between rivals leaving the three eighths, angled five wide for the drive and finished with good energy to bridge the gap. FIERCE
COMPETITION , fractious in the gate, saved ground with early pursuit, dropped back some leaving the far turn, remained inside the came back on through
the final sixteenth to out kick outer rivals for the show. MINIMO broke a bit slow, steadied when in close towards the rail approaching the turn, eased out,
moved between rivals leaving the five sixteenths then churned on through the last eighth of a mile. REGGIESSCOTCHNSODA , quickly to contention,
prompted three deep heading to the half, drifted out a path entering the turn, corrected and pursued around the turn, failed to seriously kick on in mid stretch
then faded a bit late. CATEGORY CINCO was sent up along the rail soon after the break, dueled inside the winner, failed to match strides heading to the
quarter pole then weakened in upper stretch. MYSTIC RIVER failed to keep pace, raced six to seven wide in upper stretch and dropped back.

ONCE AN EAGLE , kept outside horses, stalked the pace, circled the far turn three wide, closed, led late and lasted. EASTER SUNDAY GIRL , rated back
leaving the starting gate, was a bit rank behind horses entering the first turn, worked between rivals leaving the far turn, moved up inside foes in upper
stretch, altered course inside the sixteenth pole and rallied late. ITALIAN WAR CRY set the pace along the inner rail, opened up on the far turn, finished
willingly but failed to hold on. INDEPENDENCE WAY lacked speed, worked between horses the far turn, entered the stretch in the three path and passed
tired foes. LADY RAVEN offered a mild, three wide move on the far turn then weakened in the drive. ANXIOUS HEART lacked speed, circled the far turn
four wide and failed to menace. LORRAINE'S WAY was outurn. KISS ME MORE , well placed inside horses down the backstretch, gave way entering the
far turn. SUMMER ICE , inside horses down the backstretch, gave way on the far turn. GO WALLY GO chased the pace two wide and faltered turning for
home.

Footnotes
BORRACHO went clear soon after the break, dropped in and set a rated pace two wide, spurted away from rivals after being put to a drive in upper stretch,
remained under strong encouragement to the sixteenth pole then proved much the best while steadily hand ridden late. ISLAND D'LITE prompted the pace
to the inside of two rivals, was under some coaxing to maintain position past the five sixteenths, shifted out soon into the lane, gave valiant pursuit from
there and remained clear for the place. PIT STOP MAN , four wide outside a pair of rivals giving hard chase, could not go with the top pair in upper stretch,
gave way grudgingly in the final furlong and just saved the show. JOHN HALL , away last, settled well back, worked between rivals near mid stretch, shifted
in towards the rail and finished with interest. AEQUOR settled off the early pace while in the clear, came under pressure mid turn, angled five wide for the
drive but lacked a serious response. GREAT DAYS AHEAD , off the pace and in the clear, saved ground in the drive but failed to drum up a rally. ADDY'S
LADDY T N T , two to three wide and between rivals, was under heavy pressure mid turn, failed to kick on soon after and faltered.

Footnotes
LADY ZETA bumped with NO EASY ANSWER leaving the starting gate, two wide around the turn chasing the pace, gained the lead near the eighth pole,
raced on her left lead and drew clear under urging. MISS M M saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail in upper stretch, altered course outside
ORGANIZED CHAOS in mid stretch and rallied between horses while on her left lead. WHITEKNUCKLEFLYER stalked the pace, turned for home in the
three path and lacked the necessary rally. ORGANIZED CHAOS sped to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail, switched to her left lead in mid
stretch and gave way. NO EASY ANSWER bumped with the winner at the break, stayed along the inner rail around the turn and was no factor. GOLDEN
HEART , well off the rail around the turn, was not a factor. CLOUDS OF WHITE remained along the inner rail on the turn and trailed.

Footnotes
BRZINA , with the pace three deep and well in hand, emerged in a battled outside HALEIGH B leaving the far turn, spurted clear of that one while still rated
past the five sixteenths, widened the advantage after being set down in upper stretch, kept on under right handed encouragement past mid stretch then held
firm. BELLA BETTINA , taken to rate well off the contested early pace, commenced a three to four wide run leaving the three eighths, circled four wide and
under coaxing into the stretch, ranged up in mid stretch to be the closest pursuer and kept grinding to steadily gain. MAVILUS broke a step slow, settled off
the pace and off the inside, came three wide under a ride into the lane but could only muster up a mild run. HALEIGH B vied between rivals early then to the
inside of the winner from the far turn to the five sixteenths, was under a solid ride pursuing into the stretch then weakened in the final furlong. PISTOL LIZ
ABLAZEN , off the duelers while saving ground, eased out in upper stretch but failed to mount a rally. R SWIRVIN GIRVIN disputed the pace inside rivals,
failed to keep pace leaving the far turn, chased and faltered.
