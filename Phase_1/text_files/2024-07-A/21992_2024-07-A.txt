Footnotes
SITKA was a tad slow at the break then was rushed to the front, set the pace early, raced in the three path into the lane, came in a bit down the lane and
stayed clear in the final stages. LEND IT TEWMEY tracked the pace early on from the inside, raced near the rail into the lane, made a bid up the rail in the
stretch, was put in tight a bit down the lane, was then angled out and weakened late in the drive. LIBERTANGO chased the pace early, was in the five path
into the lane while making a bid but flattened out late in the stretch run. TOWN BRANCH stalked the pace early on, raced in the four path into the lane while
making a bid from between horses but weakened late in the stretch drive. TAP THE CANDY trailed the field throughout.
