Footnotes
GIFT OF GAB tracked the early pace and was two wide on the turn, tipped out three wide leaving the turn to make a bid and drew clear to prove much the
best under a drive. ASUE bumped at the start, dueled for the lead on the inside and made a bid to shake clear on the turn and then proved to be no match
for the winner while holding on to the place award. ARROGANTE was settled early three wide, two wide on the turn and swung out five wide leaving the turn
and finished well. RAINAS ROLLIN tracked the pace on the inside and faded in the lane. ATTACHED dueled for the lead two to three wide and weakened.
PYROTECHNICS chased the pace and was three wide on the turn and weakened. MY MASTERPIECE failed to menace. WAR MOON was not a factor.
DISCO DAISY checked by the three eighths marker and then was eased to the wire, walked off. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
DEAR SANTA set a fast unchallenged pace on the inside, then dug in gamely in the stretch and held well to prove best under a drive. PRETORIAN GOLD
stalked the early pace three wide, then was two wide on the far turn and fought on willingly but could not get to the winner while being second best. LE
GRIFFON chased the pace three wide and made a mild bid on the turn but had no late kick while besting the rest. LUCKY RUNNING CAT was reserved on
the inside, split rivals by the three eighths and advanced on the inside nearing the quarter pole, moved out but lacked the needed winning bid while clearly
besting the rest. GOING AT IT was four wide into the first turn, settled three wide early, moved to the inside on the far turn but had no rally. FLEETS BAY
was settled early and then was three wide on the far turn and then drifted out nearing the furlong marker and faded. ROAN FOR THE ROSE was reserved
early two to three wide and lacked a rally. LA PAZ was settled on the inside and dropped back. WE DONT NEED ROADS was five wide into the first turn
and was not a factor.

OMERTA CODE was taken back early on the inside, commenced a rally four wide on the far turn and came six wide off the turn and closed well to get up
with about seventy yards to go and edged clear to prove best. GURT'S WARRIOR was five wide into the first turn, prompted the pace from the outside,
made a three wide bid on the far turn and gained a short lead by the furlong marker but was caught in late stretch while being second best. NOSTALGIC
RUN was off a step slow, settled early, then was two wide by the quarter pole and was up for the show award on the inside. SPINNING MUSICIAN was four
wide into the first turn, pressed the pace three to four wide and in between rivals, made a two wide bid on the far turn to duel for command on the inside and
then faded in the final furlong, lost show award late. KAZ MUNNINGS prompted the early pace in between rivals, then fell back and tracked the pace four

BELLS RUN chased the early pace three wide and then was two wide on the turn, moved out and came four wide off the turn to make a bid and drew clear
in the final sixteenth to prove best under left handed crop urging. NINJA KITTY tracked the early pace on the outside, made a three wide bid to take over
and be clear by the quarter pole, then moved to the inside in the lane and proved to be no match for the winner in the final sixteenth while saving the place
award. SYLVIA I AM was settled early, three wide on the turn and came five wide into the lane and had a mild late kick to just miss the place award. HOPPY
TIME dueled for the lead two wide and then faded in the lane. KING MUFASA dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened. IT'S SAUL GOODMAN was
off very slowly and broke inward spotting the field about eight lengths and then trailed throughout.

WINNING CANDY stalked the pace from the outside and made a three wide bid off the turn and wore down the pace setter late to edge clear under left
handed urging. V MART set an unchallenged pace while in the two path, remained clear to the furlong marker but could not hold off the barn mate while
being clearly second best. GRUMPY BROOKSIE tracked the pace on the inside but lacked the needed winning bid, bested rest. JACK CLOUD was
reserved early, advanced four wide by the quarter pole but lacked a serious rally. LET'S GET CRAZY tracked the pace in between rivals, then checked by
the seven sixteenths and dropped back. NOTORIOUS REY failed to menace. NECCO never factored.

Footnotes
SPOOKY ONE was away alertly to set a pressured pace two wide early, then drew clear on the turn and moved to the inside, then drew out leaving the turn
and then remained well clear to prove best, driving. I ONCE STOOD ALONE prompted the pace three wide early, stalked the pace two wide on the turn and
then proved no match for the winner while staying on gamely for the place award. MR. PETE prompted the pace on the outside, then was three wide on the
turn and was out-kicked for the place award. THE GREAT CASBY was reserved early on the inside, swung out three wide leaving the turn and improved
late. SCREEN STAR lunged at the start, then advanced wide on the turn and came wide into the lane and had no late rally. AGAINST THE ODDS chased
the pace and was three to four wide on the turn and weakened. A T M AWESOME was close up early on the inside and weakened. ACT OF VALOR tracked
the pace in between rivals and then was empty.
