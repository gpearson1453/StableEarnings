Footnotes
HOLY MOLY MOSES reserved inside, angled wide in the stretch and closed strongly holding off outside challenge. FAIR HAIRED BOY lacked speed,
awaited room on the final turn, altered course in the stretch and rallied. HARBOR OF GOLD rallied on the final turn; led narrowly in midstretch but was
outfinished. MORNING MARCH saved ground behind the pacesetters and continued willingly. GAME SEVEN set a clear pace to the final turn, dueled and
faded. SHADOW MAN raced off the leaders three wide and lacked a rally. MO REWARDS lacked speed, angled inside and was never a factor. MY
MASTERPIECE forced the pace for half a mile and gave way. BACK EAST dropped back after the start and trailed throughout.

in the stretch and closed well. MEXICAN SUGAR moved closer outside into the far turn then weakened. TOOTALOO KANGAROO alternated for the lead
outside, edged clear in midstretch and continued willingly. KEEP IT SWEET dropped back outside, made a brief bid on the final turn then flattened out.
LANDOFHOPEANDREAMS moved close up inside for half a mile and faltered. NAPOLITAN lacked speed and failed to respond. PEACH TEA dueled for
half a mile inside then gave way. COLBY'S CANDLE dropped back at the start and trailed throughout.

TAKETHEMONEYHONEY dueled briefly, shook loose on the turn and drew away eagerly while ridden out. BEAUTIFULCRAZYGIRL offered outside rally on
the turn then proved no match for the winner. OOPS HAHA vied briefly inside with winner and weakened. WINE AND ROSES broke slowest and then
offered some late energy. CHIT CHAT CHUB chased in midpack and lacked a rally. TWISTED EMPRESS saved ground off the pace and never menaced.
SWEET DISTRACTION dropped back early wide and was always outrun. RACEY RUBY trailed for half mile and was never in contention. GAJA RAY
flashed speed four wide and gave way.

CAUSE I SAID dueled inside, shook loose midway on the turn and pulled away under mild urging. REE NEE'S SIX led narrowly between rivals down the
backstretch and faltered. ET'S MOON MAIDEN raced off the pace inside, angled wide on the turn with mild rally. OUR UPTOWN GIRL dropped back
outside, made a brief on the turn then flattened out. QUEEN CADENCE broke awkwardly, angled inside and was no factor. ARUMA vied three wide to
midway on the turn and gave way.

dropped back inside and rallied mildly. GIRLFROMOUTERSPACE trailed for three quarters, moved wide on the final turn and no threat. LAMASCO moved
just off the leaders inside and stopped. BOSS LIKE BETH flashed speed between rivals and gave way readily.

Footnotes
TWENTYEIGHTTOTHREE settled close up inside, awaited room on the turn, swung wide and was just up in a long drive. SMOKE WAGON advanced
outside on the turn, led in midstretch, finished gamely but was nailed at the wire. FACTOR U AND ME IN hustled to clear lead inside, vied through the turn
and weakened. STRASSE broke slowly, rushed to contention, dueled and faded. HUMBLE JOE raced wide throughout and flattened out in the stretch.
RAISEDAROOFCHARLIE chased in midpack and lacked a rally. IT'S A PITY angled inside early and failed to rally. CRACK THE CODE trailed for half mile
and was always outrun. HOT LOVE broke poorly, moved wide then stopped.
