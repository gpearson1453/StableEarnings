SPARKLE SWEETLY away in good order, ceded the early lead and stalked the pace four wide into the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run
and tracked the moderate pace between rivals nearing the half-mile marker, chased three then two wide into the far turn and was roused at the quarter pole,
confronted CARSON JEN and vied for the lead at mid-stretch, took command into the final sixteenth and drew clear under mild urging in deep stretch.
CASTAGNA broke alertly and assumed early command, showed the way into the first turn while three wide, ceded the lead into the backstretch run and
attended to the moderate pace approaching the half-mile marker, saved ground into the far turn, got caught a bit in tight and was boxed in nearing the
quarter pole, navigated traffic into upper stretch then shifted out at the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and got
up in deep stretch for the place honors. CARSON JEN bobbled away from the start, recovered to be forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the pace
five wide into the first turn, went widest into the backstretch run, made a middle move and assumed command heading to the half-mile, shifted to the inside
and set the pace into the far turn, led into the stretch, came under pressure at the furlong marker, could not hold off the winner past mid-stretch and just
missed for second at the finish. PIPPA PHILIPA allowed to settle away from the start, saved ground into the first turn, maintained an inside path into the
backstretch run while not far back, chased inside into the far turn and could not muster a response in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
CLEVER CLOVER was forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the moderate early pace from the outside and was well placed approaching the turn,
chased three to four wide nearing the quarter pole, was roused into upper stretch and mounted a four to five wide rally heading to the furlong marker,
loomed at mid-stretch, vied for the lead and took command into the final sixteenth, shook free in deep stretch and held in a drive at the finish. RAMATHORN
sent to establish the early lead, was well handled while setting a moderate pace heading to the half-mile marker, pressed into the turn by ROLLIN DICE,
battled that rival into the stretch and shook free nearing the furlong marker, met the bid of CLEVER CLOVER past mid-stretch, grudgingly gave way in the
final sixteenth and held well in the end for second. ROLLIN DICE broke alertly, ceded the early lead to RAMATHORN and stalked the pace outside of that
rival heading to the half-mile marker, advanced into the turn and pressed the pace two to three wide nearing the quarter pole, was repelled into upper
stretch and chased RAMATHORN approaching the furlong pole, re-rallied past mid-stretch and vied for the lead between runners into the final sixteenth,
was outfinished in deep stretch and just missed for second. ALPINE SERMON a bit slow into stride away from the start, recovered to settle just off of the
moderate early pace, was guided two wide into the turn and advanced nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was gaining in the final
sixteenth and missed for the minor awards. BERTACCHI tracked the moderate early pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn and lost position at the
quarter pole, could not muster a response into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
CLARINA broke well then opted to let ANN LOVES MARK dictate the early fractions, stalked that one to the turn then bid for the lead from the quarter pole,
took command at the head of the stretch and drew away to win clear. MANIAE was a little slow into stride after the break but moved up the rail into
contention before the turn, kept to the inside through the turn, angled out to the middle of the track for the stretch run finished well enough to close the gap
on ANN LOVES MARK and just got up for the second spot. ANN LOVES MARK broke sharply and seized the early lead, raced well away from the rail in the
two to three path down the backstretch, held sway to the turn, had little response when challenged by CLARINA at the quarter pole but kept on, weakened a
little in the final yards and was nosed out for the place at the wire. CANDY LITZ lacked any early speed and was outrun through the early stages, launched
a rally with three furlongs to run while still well behind the rest, stayed to the inside and passed one in the stretch. PALACE MISCHIEF broke well but was
not fast enough to contend for the early lead, raced close while staying outside in the five path down the backstretch, went into a stiff drive from the
seven-sixteenths pole but was unable to quicken with the rest, flattened out in the stretch and could not improve.

LION'S LAIR rated just off of the early pace, tracked the leading pair from the outside heading to the half-mile marker, chased three to four wide into the turn
and was roused nearing the quarter pole, vied for the lead into upper stretch and drew to even terms with BACALAR at the furlong marker, battled that rival
into the final sixteenth, shook free in deep stretch and held in a drive for a determined win. BACALAR prominent away from the start, rushed up in the early
stages and contested the solid pace inside of BLACK ZABAT heading to the half-mile marker, dueled that rival into the turn and took a narrow lead at the
quarter pole, vied into upper stretch and met the bid of LION'S LAIR nearing the furlong marker, battled the winner into the final sixteenth, was repelled in
deep stretch and held for second at the finish. BOURBON GLAZE bobbled leaving the start and was away a bit slowly, recovered and tracked the solid early
pace from the inside, was well placed approaching the turn and chased the pace two wide along the bend, got caught in tight nearing the quarter pole and
waited for racing room nearing the top of the stretch, shifted out in upper stretch and lost position at the furlong marker, re-rallied in the final sixteenth and
outfinished ROSES R BLUE to secure show honors. ROSES R BLUE took back off of the solid early pace, raced outside of rivals into the turn and
advanced three to four wide nearing the quarter marker, maintained an outside path into the drive and continued her run at mid-stretch, was gaining in the
final sixteenth and was outfinished for third in deep stretch. LITTLE LILIANA settled off of the solid early pace, raced two wide into the turn, angled widest
into the stretch drive and ran evenly to the furlong marker, needed more in the final sixteenth and offered a mild late rally. BLACK ZABAT hustled away from
the start, assumed early command then was engaged by BACALAR and disputed the solid pace with that rival heading to the half-mile marker, dueled
outside of BACALAR into the turn and pressed the pace two to three wide nearing the quarter pole, vied for the lead between rivals into upper stretch, lost
position and chased at mid-stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and gave way. TOPANTICIPATION (GB) lacked early speed and was
unhurried away from the start, trailed into the turn and was guided three to four wide nearing the quarter pole, could not muster a response in the stretch
drive and did not factor.

Footnotes
MY DOMINATOR tracked the dueling leaders through the early stages while always traveling well, moved from the inside to the three path before the turn,
the rider took a couple of confident looks behind near the quarter pole, seized the lead, then pulled away from the rest in the stretch to an easy victory.
GROSS PROFIT broke well but was outrun down the backstretch, launched an extended rally from the seven-sixteenths pole, took the two path through the
turn, continued to run on down the stretch and was along for second while no threat to the winner. HAY JUAN was quick away, dueled with DRIVERS ED to
the turn, put that one away easily near the three furlong pole, then proved no match for MY DOMINATOR as that one took over the lead at the quarter pole,
held the second position to mid-stretch then weakened late and could not hold off GROSS PROFIT for the place. GRAZEN SUN broke with the pack then
tracked mid-pack through the early stages, moved out to the four path for clear run then continued that path through the turn while starting to rally, came into
the stretch four or five wide, raced on the wrong lead through most of the stretch run and was unable to crack the top three. MISSED CALL veered out
sharply at the start and spotted the field a head start, trailed far behind, attempted to rally from the seven-sixteenths marker but flattened out in the stretch
chased the rest to the wire. DRIVER'S ED was hustled to the lead from the break, dueled with HAY JUAN through the early stages, did not respond when
challenged near the three furlong marker, trailed into the stretch and was not persevered with in the late stages.

Footnotes
TIGER QUEEN broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, showed good speed while setting a quick pace heading to the half-mile marker, was well
handled along the turn and set decent fractions while off of the rail nearing the quarter pole, was challenged into the stretch and kept foes at bay nearing the
furlong marker, responded to urging past mid-stretch, shook free into the final sixteenth and drew clear in the late stages to hold sway. TESSA (GB) was
pinched back at the start and was away slowly, was unhurried in the early running, improved position two to three wide along the turn, angled out for the
stretch drive and gained ground at the furlong marker, closed into the final sixteenth, could not impact the winner in deep stretch and got up in the final
strides for second. HONORABLE GAL was prominent away from the start, tracked the solid early pace from the inside heading to the half-mile marker, was
well placed entering the turn, chased from the inside approaching the quarter pole, maintained an inside path into the drive and ran in pursuit at mid-stretch,
was outkicked in the final sixteenth and won the nod for third at the finish. A ROUSING BABE took back off of the solid early pace, rushed up at the half-mile
marker and chased the pace three to four wide into the turn, bumped with IRISH PRANCER along then turn then loomed at the quarter pole, chased TIGER
QUEEN approaching the furlong marker, could not keep pace with the winner past mid-stretch and was outfinished for the minor awards. IRISH PRANCER
broke in a bit at the start and crowded a neighboring rival, was forwardly placed in the early running and stalked the pace from the outside heading to the
half-mile marker, chased between rivals into the turn, went two to three wide and between runners nearing the quarter pole, got caught in tight and made
contact with A ROUSING BABE at that station, lost position into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. CANAM GAL broke out at the start and was
away slowly, settled off of the solid early pace while not far back, raced outside of rivals into the turn and went three to four wide nearing the quarter pole,
ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
ELMER JOHN ducked in at the start and bothered NO D'ORO, then tracked the pacesetter to the turn, moved to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole
and took command at the top of the stretch, responded to steady handling and won clear in a solid debut. NO D'ORO got pinched at the start, recovered,
then tracked the pace three wide, launched a bid from the quarter pole, loomed a threat to mid-stretch then could not match strides with the winner in the
late stages while holding clear for second. RIOLO was sent to the lead form the break, came away a bit awkwardly and cut in front of BESKAR to the inside
but was well clear, held sway through the turn, gave way in upper stretch then kept to task to hold third. BESKAR raced at the head of the second group but
well off the pace, ran evenly throughout. CANTILEVER outrun from the break, raced very wide, tipped out to the five or six path in the stretch and failed to
menace. BEAR ENCOUNTER lacked early speed, angled over to the rail for the run through the turn, kept to task but was never a factor. PER THE HORSE
RACING INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, ELMER JOHN HAS BEEN DQ'D FROM 1ST TO UNPLACED FOR POSITIVE TEST.
