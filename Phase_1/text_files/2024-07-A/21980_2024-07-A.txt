Footnotes
ON THE SHORTLIST set the pace from the inside, turned back the bid from MY THOUGHTS leaving the turn and edged clear in the final sixteenth to prove
best under a drive. LADY OUTOFTHE BLUE was reserved early two to three wide, then saved ground on the turn, moved out and came five wide into0 the
lane and closed fast late to gain the place award. MY THOUGHTS prompted the pace three to two wide, made a two wide bid nearing the quarter pole, then
went on even terms for command leaving the turn but hung late, losing the place award but saving the show award. EIGHT DANZAS was well rated along
the inside, eased off the inside leaving the quarter pole and came three wide into the lane, moved out in the lane and had a late rally to just miss the show
award. SIDESWIPED tracked the pace three wide and weakened. LOVELY EVER AFTER was bumped at the start, then settled early, two wide on the far
turn and had no rally. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

MAJOR THOMAS was well placed early on the inside, moved out on the far turn and made a three wide bid to go on even terms off the bend, then slowly
edged clear in the final sixteenth to prove best under a drive. FLETCHER vied for the lead three wide, made a two wide bid on the far turn to shake clear,
then was headed by the winner off the turn and was out-kicked while fighting on grudgingly. SACHMO was settled early on the inside, advanced on the turn
and came three wide into the lane and rallied but needed more, bested rest. LAKE NAKURU was reserved early on the inside, advanced on the inside on
the far turn, angled out by the three sixteenths and had a belated rally. KEEN LOOKIN was reserved early, advanced three wide on the backstretch, then
made a three to four wide move on the far turn but flattened out. SIREN vied for the lead on the inside and weakened. LACCO AMENO was off slowly and
had no speed and lacked a rally. SHAKE THE GOLD was reserved early, three to four wide on the far turn and had no rally. EASTER BET chased the pace
three wide and tired. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

remained clear to the wire to prove best while being kept to crop urging. FILTERED LIGHT stalked the pace and made a mild bid three wide on the far turn,
could not go with the winner and then was bumped by the furlong marker and then won the bob for the place award. GIRVINIZED pressed the pace on the
inside, fell back leaving the five sixteenth marker, then came two wide into the lane, drifted out under left handed crop urging and bumped FILTERED LIGHT
by the furlong marker and then lost the head bob for the place award. FAYTASTIC chased the early pace, four wide by the quarter pole but had no late rally.
