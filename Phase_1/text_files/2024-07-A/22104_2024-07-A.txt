Footnotes
DARK FURY pressed the pace in the three path, dueled through the stretch and dug in under steady urging. ADALENE was clear early in the two path,
dueled through the stretch inside of the winner but was outfinished. VINO IN FLORENCE was squeezed back as the field passed the temporary rail and the
gap and approached the main rail, angled to the four path at the five-eighths pole, bid at the quarter pole but faltered. NOTA BELLE stalked the pace in the
two path but had no late bid. MISS MONROE COUNTY, like VINO IN FLORENCE, was squeezed back as approaching the main rail, bid along the rail at
the quarter pole but couldn't close late. U AIN'T THAT LUCKY raced in the four path with no bid.

Footnotes
MAGIC IN MOTION stalked the early pace in the four path, rallied at the three-eighths pole, drew off on the turn under a drive and geared down late. U R
NOT THE FATHER stalked the pace inside, was steadied at the three-quarters pole, raced in the four path around the far turn, bid but was no match. GET
ME ONE TOO came in at the fifteen-sixteenths pole, bothering a rival, pressed the pace in the three path and yielded in the stretch.. YOSHIDA'S IMPACT
raced three wide and rallied belatedly inside but faltered. OUTSTANDINGJUSTICE was unrushed, bid in the two path on the far turn but failed to menace.
MAMA'S BOY stalked the pace in the four path but faded in the stretch. INSTINCTUALLY was checked hard in tight quarters near the fifteen-sixteenths
pole, then was no factor. SWIFT RELIEF was not a factor. WARING led inside before giving way on the far turn. This race had a timing discrepancy or
malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
