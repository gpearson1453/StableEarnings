leaving the gate and was squeezed back at the start, raced in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter, navigated the turn from the three path,
began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. ALCAZABA (IRE) tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn
in the two path and kept on to the wire. MIDNIGHT ROYAL raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter, continued around the turn in the
three path and showed no kick. COLOR ME LEGENDARY veered in and bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, recovered to chase the leader on
the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and weakened in the lane. CAPALA raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch,

STREET WARRIOR tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn and drew off in the lane.
GENERAL BATTLE AXE raced off the pace on the inside early, navigated the turn from the two path and improved position in the stretch while proving to be
no match for the winner. SUPERSTAR SWANK raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming around the turn and
made up some ground in the lane while never truly threatening. FROSTY VIEW led the way on the inside through the opening quarter, saved ground around
the turn and weakened in the stretch. MACH TWO chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the three path and tired
from there.

XTREME DIVA chased the leaders up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bold bid entering the stretch, quickly took command and
drew off to the wire. CALL'EM ALL pressed the pace on the outside through the opening quarter, continued to battle from the three path around the turn and
chased on in the lane, no match for the winner. HONORABLE MISCHIEF led the way on the inside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the two
path and kept on in the stretch, no match for the winner. MINNESOTA ROSE trailed the field throughout, saved ground around the turn and was never a
factor. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
