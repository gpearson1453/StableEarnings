Footnotes
LINDA'S TAJ became a bit anxious in the gate when Gone With The Wyn became fractious, then rated close into the first turn, challenged toward the three
eighths pole and took over approaching the five sixteenths, drew clear nearing the quarter, widened at the rail on the far turn and was kept alert in the
stretch. DASHING LASS saved early ground well off the pace, bid leaving the half mile pole and improved steadily from that point, ran through the far turn
about the five path and settled for second best. MRS. SPEAKER raced four wide on the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn
about the three path and came along for third mid-stretch. GLASS STAR veered out leaving the gate then closed to the lead two deep into the first turn,
came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, was met toward the five sixteenths and faded off the rail on the far turn. GONE WITH THE WYN
became fractious in the gate, rounded the first turn about the three path and gave chase leaving the nine sixteenths pole, but weakened into the far turn.
DIVINE SPIRIT showed little response through the backstretch. MARTHA'S HEART became anxious in the gate when Gone With The Wyn became
fractious, raced off the rail on the first turn and gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, but weakened in the three path on the far turn.

PATTERN BET stalked the early pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, took over past the quarter and was steadily encouraged through the lane.
THENCOMEMORNING stalked off the rail then challenged from the three eighths pole and dueled at mostly even terms from that point, dropped back past
the quarter pole but dug in through the lane and held on for second. BREADMAN'S ROSEBUD saved ground racing well off the pace, gave chase nearing
the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and finished well. LUCKY BLONDE saved ground off the pace, gave chase leaving the half mile
pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and showed little further. CRUZ IN THE CASTLE quickly took over and rated the pace, came under pressure
approaching the three eighths pole, was caught passing the quarter and weakened off the rail nearing the head of the lane. TIZ VINNO was taken up soon
after the start and appeared sore but was walked off.

RAISE A RUCKUS rated the early pace inside, was met into the backstretch and stayed with the pace from that point, recovered the advantage approaching
the quarter pole and held well under steady stretch handling. COURT TUDOR exchanged contact with LOVE IS WICKED leaving the gate then settled off
the rail the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole, closed steadily and raced in the six path on the far turn, dug in widest to
take second mid-stretch and was gaining late on the winner. The latter exchanged contact with Court Tudor leaving the gate then raced in the four path the
first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and dug in to take third later yards. DENIZETTI saved
ground on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, but flattened mid-stretch. RIDE THE
BRAND angled sharply in and made contact with Evanesco shortly after the start then stalked three wide on the first turn, gave chase leaving the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and flattened in the lane. SEA OF TRANQUILITY was forced in shortly after the start then stalked two
deep the first turn, took a slim lead nearing the three eighths pole but was caught approaching the quarter, dropped back midway on the far turn and
weakened in the lane. EVANESCO was bumped and forced in after the start then saved ground on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole
but flattened in the four path on the far turn.

PRIME SHOPPING settled well off the early pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and improved steadily, raced in the five path on the far turn, dug
in for the lead late yards and raced clear nearing the wire. GOLDEN ASSET ducked in and made contact with W V Lad leaving the gate then stalked in the
four path the first turn, took the lead three wide into the backstretch and rated the pace from that point, was pressured past the three eighths pole and
dueled clear midway on the far turn, drifted entering the stretch and dug in under steady handling, but was caught flattening stride late. YOUTHFUL
ENERGY was bumped off stride shortly after the start then saved ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on
the far turn and finished evenly to take third late yards. BRADLEY DO RIGHT rated a slim lead inside on the first turn, was met and gave chase leaving the
turn but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened in the lane. GRANDY bobbled leaving the gate and raced off the rail the first turn, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the three path on the far turn. ALDARIGHTTRICKS raced in the seven path the first turn, picked up
the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, showed little response and rounded the far turn about the six path. PARK AVE PRINCE stalked two deep the first
turn, challenged while between horses leaving the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back toward the quarter pole and flattened off the rail the far turn. W V

Footnotes
IRISH KING rated close from the three path on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, was forced in
nearing mid-stretch but dug in determinedly to hold on. SENSUAL CHOCOLATE raced off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, dug in leaving the turn then lugged in toward mid-stretch and was outfinished through the final
sixteenth. TIZAWINNER raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and
came along for third late yards. FUJI FIRE was hustled to the lead inside and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the seven sixteenths pole,
kept the edge at the rail on the far turn, was caught passing the eighth pole, drifted a path and was checked toward mid-stretch and weakened the final
sixteenth. IT'S SAUL GOODMAN saved ground on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and
ran evenly in the stretch. RAMBUNCTIOUS RIDE rounded the opening turn about the four path and showed little response through the backstretch.
BESOTTED stalked two deep then challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole, but dropped back past the five sixteenths and faded at the rail on the far
turn. The Stewards reviewed, and rejected a claim of foul against the rider of Irish King for interference near mid-stretch, lodged by the rider of Fuji Fire.
