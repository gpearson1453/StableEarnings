Footnotes
GOOD RAPPORT settled on the rail in mid-division down the backstretch, waited patiently on the fence behind the trio that was sitting behind the
frontrunner through the bend, skimmed the rail closing in smartly at the quarter pole, posed the main threat on the inside down the stretch, seized command
going on by at the furlong marker and was extending the advantage at the finish line. STORMIN DAVE had a slim lead up top down the backstretch, spurted
away for clear control at the three eighths marker, continued to move well on the lead turning for home, offered little resistance while still on the wrong lead
when collared by the winner inside at the furlong marker and stayed on stubbornly to be second best at the wire. THIS DUDE A BREEZE travelled in
midfield on the outside in the early going, kept a close eye on the pacesetter three wide on the turn, moved in by the quarter pole to be in the hunt three
wide at the top of the lane, could not match strides with the top duo by mid-stretch and finished up to be a clear but non threatening third when crossing the
line. LOBBY BAR was ahead of one rival down the backstraight, started to extend his stride, moving in midway on the turn, just when he was commencing a
rally, had to be throttled down behind rivals at the quarter pole, swung widest in the six path straightening for home and had good late energy to settle on the
fringes in the end. YORKVILLE stalked four deep outside foes near the rear, made little impression three wide going around the bend, angled five wide
circling weakening horses at the quarter pole and could not be a factor, running one paced in the stretch. CONFUSING shadowed the pace outside down
the backstretch, had a tracking role between runners around the bend, was checked mildly when losing position nearing the quarter pole in the three path
and could not get involved four wide driving to the finish line. ALWAYS A WAY lacked early foot even though was hustled to stay interested down the back
straight, continued to see the field around the bend and could only pass a weary foe in deep stretch. ALBERTA BE MINE watched the engaged duo down
the backside, chased the frontrunner while travelling inside foes on the rail entering the turn, had nothing more to offer midturn, backing away with five
sixteenths to run and emptied out in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
CANTUCCI had the lead outside horses in the beginning, was then content to track the pacesetter along the backside, started to edge closer, measuring the
leader at the three furlong marker, bid outside at the furlong pole and wore down the rival in the shadow of the wire for the score. ABSOLUTE CHAIRMAN
pressed the lead inside early on, took over command by the half, dictated the pace going comfortably around the bend, was challenged on the outside with
a furlong to go, fought on until late but gave way grudgingly just before the finish line. SPANISH SERENADE watched the top two down the backstretch,
was roused for more three eighths out, but could only keep pace with the leaders through the turn, was encouraged left handed in upper stretch, shifted
outside in the three path at the furlong marker and kept on trying until the end to hold for third money. BILL NEEDLE stalked in the third flight in the two path
inside a rival the majority of the race, shifted out four wide straightening for home, was gaining on the leaders through the stretch but could not improve his
position when crossing the finish at the end. BAR TALK settled in mid-pack in the beginning, saved ground but made little progression throughout the turn,
shifted out three wide while inside runners turning for home and finished up evenly down the lane. THIS KATZ FOR REAL was ahead of only one rival down
the back straight, offered a mild run when angling off foes three wide at the quarter pole, continued outside rivals in the six path at the top of the lane but
lacked a finish driving to the wire. DIXIE'S FLATTER stalked near the rear in the three path outside horses, made little progression around the turn, shifted
out to be three wide for the drive but could not reach contention in the stretch drive. CHASING BOURBON settled on the outside of a rival in the third flight
in the early stages of the race, was scrubbed on but was going in the wrong direction by the quarter pole and faltered down the stretch. HOLIDAY IN CHILE
was unhurried trailing down the backstretch, could not get interested through the turn and could not be a factor in the stretch running.

Footnotes
SILVER PISTOL took control right from the onset, moved well loose on the lead through the turn, opened up on the rivals in upper stretch and cruised on
home for the frontrunning score. JOHNNY GOLD settled on the fence behind the winner at the half, was roused three eighths out keeping pace with the
chasing group around the turn and finished up smartly on the fence to win the duel for the runners up share in the final seventy yards. WETIKO was brushed
outside on the start, stalked in the two path near the rear down the backstretch, was under a hard ride starting to pass rivals three wide outside with a
quarter left to run, angled out in the five path gathering momentumm, found another gear when switching leads at the furlong pole and closed in late to get
up for third money. LEFT IN MY DUST had a tracking role three deep outside foes down the back straight, watched the lead pair still three wide outside
horses on the turn, took closer order on the top duo by the quarter pole, dueled for a place share when the winner cleared away at the top of the stretch but
was outfinished late and settled for a minor share in the end. SING DIXIE travelled in mid-pack at the half, ran even while taking the shortest way around on
the bend, was one paced in the stretch and could not get involved. CHEAP SPEED tracked between rivals in the two path along the backside, chased the
loose frontrunner around the turn, was in the mix for a share of the prize two wide with horses on both sides, could not go on and yielded at the sixteenth
pole. TIPSY FOX settled on the rail in midfield in the early going, lost position on the fence at the seven sixteenths pole, had little to offer taking the short
way around on the bend and failed to menace in the stretch running inside. GOLDEN WIND was brushed inside to begin, was ahead of only the poor starter
long the backside, to closer order to stalk four wide on the outside at the three furlong marker, could not improve anymore through the turn, angled six wide
for the drive but made little presence in the stretch. TONTO broke a step slow to begin, spotted the field by many in mid-backstretch and could not recover
to get involved in the race.

Footnotes
SALVATOR MUNDI was close early then eased back off the pace tracking inside, angled five wide turning for home, struck the lead in mid-stretch, soon
moved clear and held sway under moderate urging. VICTORY MARCH settled off the pace racing toward the rear near the inside, cut the corner turning for
home, rallied inside but was only second best. LONG POND settled at the back racing between foes into the turn, fanned seven wide leaving that bend
making a mild bid in upper stretch but evened out. BLUE MAX was fractious in the gate, bumped lightly early, settled about mid-pack two to three wide into
the turn, came out a bit in upper stretch seeking room improved position. MIDNIGHT ARKLE bumped a rival just after the start then moved forward between
rivals to soon take the led, set the pace from off the rail, was pressured thoroughly by an outside foe near the three-eighths, overtaken by that one past the
five-sixteenths, fought on through upper stretch but simply lacked the needed late kick and weakened. SOUPER RIVER stalked just off and outside the
leader, pressed that one entering the turn forcing the issue, took a narrow lead past the five-sixteenths, weakened late. MAGIC TOMAHAWK got away well
then was allowed to settle dropping back to the rear half of the field, raced off the inside part of the track, was never a threat. FOUR ACES HIGH was urged
at the break racing close up outside four wide into the turn, floated six wide turning for home, was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
PET SOUNDS had a slim lead at the start, was relegated to the chasing role by the half outside the leader, seized control again in the two path between
horses at the three furlong marker, opened up mildly in upper stretch and kept on rolling to the wire for an impressive victory when crossing the finish line.
NORTH WARDEN tracked inside down the back straight, waited to move behind the lead trio around the bend, shifted to the three path by the quarter pole,
found a seam to have clear running room in the four path at the top of the stretch and closed in late for the place share. POPWEISER prompted the pace
three wide on the outside of the leaders down the backside, continued to force the issue around the turn, loomed the main threat in the three path
straightening for the drive, chased the winner in vain to the wire and faded late, losing second money nearing the finish line. ONTARIO HOLIDAY was
bumped hard then squeezed at the start, settled in midfield under a tight hold between foes at the half, tracked two wide with runners on both sides in the
second flight on the turn, angled out to the six path in upper stretch to be in range for a share down the lane and stayed on to capture a minor share in the
end. BUCK'S FIZZ broke in a tangle to trail early on, improved when splitting foes three wide at the three eighths pole passing runners smartly, shifted
outside to the five path by the quarter pole extending his stride, angled to the seven path at the top of the lane but finished up evenly to the wire. SO
CALLED VACATION travelled four deep outside foes near the rear in the beginning, was hustled at the half trying to get better position into the turn, made
little impact stalking in the third flight three wide through the turn, was pushed out to the seven path for the stretch run and still finished up willingly in deep
stretch. SWERVIN MERVYN veered in at the start, tracked the lead trio four deep outside foes at the half, travelled three wide on the outside in the second
flight around the turn, angled out to be in the six path turning for home but lacked a bid down the lane. TRUE SHOT co-trailed the compact field on the
inside at the half, made little headway around the bend, angled just off the rail to be in the two path straightening for home but could not be a factor running
to the wire. KING VIDA was bumped and forced in at the start, had nowhere to go near the back on the fence at the half, waited on the rail in the third flight
through the turn, angled out in the three path behind runners for the drive but lacked a finish in the stretch. JAVA POWER co-trailed the tightly bunched
pack on the outside at the half, could see the field around the bend and could only pass the stopping rival who was hard used early on. ARRAKASTA IZAN
pressed the pace on the rail in the beginning, briefly poked his head in front on the fence at the half, dueled inside around the bend, was empty by the top of
the lane and stopped on the rail through the stretch.

Footnotes
C MY MEISTER unhurriedly brought up the rear, began to advance outside foes on the far turn, swung nine to ten wide for the drive, rallied widest of all and
edged past late. ELUSIVE KNIGHT settled outside well back of the leaders two to three wide, advanced on the far turn four then five wide fanning eight
deep into upper stretch, bid late but was outkicked by an outside runner. PALIO settled inside about mid-pack, rallied between foes two to three wide in the
stretch but missed. AVOMAN rated in behind the leading pair outside three to four wide stalking, floated five to six deep into upper stretch, made a mild bid
in mid-stretch taking a narrow lead briefly around the eighth pole but was outfinished. CLASSY WHISPER tracked just off the leaders from inside saving
ground, bid up the rail in the stretch but was outkicked. STEAK AND CHEESE set the pace from off the rail in the two path, drifted three to four wide turning
for home when challenged and overtaken, lacked the needed late kick. MIGHTY SEA settled two to three wide off the pace, was put to urging by the
five-sixteenths, came out seven wide in the stretch, went evenly late without being asked. PROVEN STRATEGIES pressed the pace from outside three
wide, was ridden past the five-sixteenths, came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
DRESDEN ROW broke out to start, rated kindly three wide outside foes along the backside, moved in to bid three wide at the quarter pole, was repelled
momentarily in upper stretch but was relentless in his pursuit and wore down the leader in the shadow of the wire for the win. SOUPED UP pressed the
issue on the rail in the beginning, took over the top spot with five eighths remaining, was headed outside by the winner at the quarter pole, spurted away in
upper stretch but could not withstand late charge by the winner in the final seventy yards. SOUPER WATSON co-trailed on the inside down the backside,
shifted out off rivals in the three path through the turn but could not gain on runners, swung out widest in the seven path straightening for home and surged
late, passing horses in deep stretch to be a clear third at the wire. RAPID TEST was unhurried early to trail on the fence, improved position when coaxed
along the backstretch to be nestled behind the leaders by the half, could not keep pace with the front two who separated themselves at the quarter pole but
did show grit to never waver on the fence down the lane and got the nod right at the wire to settle on the fringes in the end. RED RIVER REBEL travelled in
mid-division with rivals on both sides down the back straight, edged closer three wide at the quarter pole, shifted out to be five wide for the stretch drive in
the thick of things for a placing, could not find more late and faded nearing the wire. MAAKWA had a narrow advantage between horses in the two path
leaving the chute, shadowed the leader outside five furlongs from home, was nudged between the leaders in midturn, could not go on with the winner by the
quarter pole and emptied out in the two path in deep stretch. PERFECT CRIME co-trailed on the outside down the backstretch, angled out to be four wide
circling foes at the three eighths marker, quickened smartly, making a bold move at the quarter pole, was fanned out in the six path while in the mix for a
share turning for home, could not sustain the run and retreated by the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
MATICULANT was in the mix up front on the rail to begin, assumed command under a snug hold by the half, comfortably increased the margin up top
around the bend, was kept to the task to the wire and held safe for the front end score. FASCINATION STREET pulled the rider to the lead outside in the
beginning, prompted the pace four deep outside by the half, chased the pacesetting winner throughout the turn, continued in vain to reel in the winner down
the stretch but did still stubbornly fight on to hold for the runners up share in the end. PARADISE PERFECT was four deep outside runners in mid-division
along the backside, was roused three furlongs out keeping pace with rivals on the bend, swooped around foes to start a rally four wide at the quarter pole,
angled out to be five wide for the drive, switched leads when encouraged right handed at the furlong marker and found more late to close in and capture the
show award. MIDNIGHT TEMPESTA was nestled on the fence just sitting behind the winner down the backside, followed the path set by the winner taking
the shortest way round through the turn, dueled inside for the place share turning for home but got a little leg weary late and faded nearing the wire to settle
on the fringes in the end. FOREST FLASH was under a tight rein in the second flight watching the engaged trio at the half, waited for his cue to move
around the bend, burst between foes quickly, when finding a seam three wide at the quarter pole, loomed a threat four wide straightening out for home but
evened out to the wire, to be on the losing end between horses for a minor role. LONHRO'S GAMBLE was nudged along near the rear stalking on the fence
down the backside, improved slightly saving all the ground around the turn, shifted just outside in the two path for the drive but failed to reach contention
through the lane. BOSTON BAY vied between runners in the three path for the lead early on, tracked behind the frontrunner at the half, lost ground when
shuffled back positions at the three furlong pole, could not recover on the turn and posed little threat in the stretch running. OH PEANUTS was situated
between horses in midfield down the back straight, improved position to close in to keep a close eye on the top pair three wide through the turn, came under
a ride between rivals but could not quicken with them at the quarter pole and failed to menace in the stretch running in the four path to the wire. PLAY THE
DOTS stalked near the rear three wide along the backstretch, made little impression outside runners around the bend, shifted out to be in the five path for
the stretch run but could no be a factor driving to the finish line. JACK was ahead of only the troubled starter down the back straight, was uninterested on
the turn when passed by the trailing foe outside at the three eighths marker and came back on again in upper stretch to pass that rival in the lane.
TROPICAL GETAWAY appeared to bobble slightly on the break, trailed down the backside, passed a rival outside at the three eighths marker, could not
find more turning for home and was relegated to see the field again by upper stretch.
