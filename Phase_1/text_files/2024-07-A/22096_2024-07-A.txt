Footnotes
LIBITINA showed good early foot along the inside and drew off through the stretch run under steady handling. THUNDER BERN prompt the early leader
from the outside of rival, kept on but was no match in the drive for the winner. KUKU stalked the top pair three deep and had not enough in the drive.
FLORINA was off a step slow and bumped at the start to trail, raced four wide around the far turn, swung six to seven wide into the lane and closed in mildly
to improve position. MISS TAPATIA dropped back near the back early on, raced four to five wide into the upper stretch and had no response. JUDY'S
FLYER settled to race mid pack, was two to three deep in the stretch run and lacked a solid bid. LIZ DREAMIN chased the pace along the inside and faded.
BODY LANGUAGE chased the pace from the outside, raced three to four wide around the far turn and stopped.

Footnotes
MY SANCTUARY rated along down the backstretch under a firm hold, made a good rail bid through the stretch run and surged up late under strong
pressure. BLAME THE CLOUDS raced mid pack early on, waited for racing room near the three sixteenths pole,angled out to make a bid between rivals
and led late but was denied and missed in a game effort. MORTAL SIN stalked the early going, raced three wide near the five sixteenths pole, shifted five
wide to make a bid but was outfinished late. WHERE'S CHARLIE was bumped soundly at the start, raced near the back early, swung seven wide into the
lane and finished gamely to the wire. MOTION GRANTED was bumped, jostled at the start, drafted off the early pace setters, raced from the inside into the
upper stretch, angled out near the eighth pole and finished willingly to the wire. TIGGEROO was bumped soundly at the break, raced three deep into the
upper stretch, angled out to race from the far outside and closed in mildly. STREET OUTLAW pressed two deep and faltered inside the eighth pole.
AMERICAN DAY raced from the inside near the five sixteenths pole, angled out through the drive and had no late rally. THIRD DEGREE pressed the early
going near the rail and weakened in the latter stages. HOLLYWOOD HERO trailed early on, angled wide through the stretch run and never threatened.
PEYTON'S DAY tracked outside of foes and faded.

Footnotes
BONNE FILLE prompt the early leader two deep, hard chase through the far turn, eased out four wide into the upper stretch and finished well to get up late
under strong handling. BEYOND QUESTION showed good early foot to clear off and cross over to the inside, led inside the sixteenth pole and was wore
down late in a game effort. LOST RIVER tracked the top pair from the inside and kept on to the wire. SEA LION steadied on the inside nearing the three
eighths marker and dropped back, saved ground through the far turn, eased out four wide through the drive and had a belated rally. ALL GAS NO BRAKES
urged along, raced three wide around the far turn and weakened. CHICKIN LICKIN urged along early, raced two deep between around the far turn and
weakened.

encouragement. EUPHIMA (ARG) stalked the pace, made a good rail bid in the lane, led near the sixteenths pole and missed in a game effort. CALL TO
ORDER urged from the outside of foes, raced four wide into the upper stretch and made a four wide bid to loom boldly by the furlong marker but flattened
out.. CALL THE QUESTION raced from the inside around the far turn, angled out and finished willingly to the wire. BABY BLOCKS vied for the early lead
from the inside and faltered inside the eighth pole. CAJUN EXPECTATION chased the early pace, was near the inside at the three sixteenths pole, angled
out and was even with no closing run. MOMENTOUS MISS pressed two deep and faded. DELIZIOSA raced five to six wide in the stretch and had no
response. QUEEN AIKO mid pack early on the inside and checked by the three eights marker and dropped back. CORINTH void of early speed and failed

Footnotes
B G LEE rated along the inside, angled through the upper stretch and finished strongly to edge clear late under steady pressure. GRAND JOURNEY
tracked the early leader two deep, took command through the far turn to draw clear, then remained clear by the furlong marker but weakened late and was
caught while staying on to be clearly second best. SUMMER SILENCE stalked the pace, made a three to four wide bid in the stretch and flattened out late.
CANDY KINGDOM raced mid pack early, had an inside run and moved up late to improve position. ARTEMUS BRIDGE dropped back early on, raced six to
seven wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. RECONVENE void of early speed to trail early on, raced near the inside around the far turn, raced
two wide between near the eighth pole and had not enough. NOBLE CONQUEST raced from the inside around the far turn and lacked a solid bid. VINTNER
raced three to five wide around the far turn, was near the outside in the stretch and had no late rally. CITY PLAN swung wide into the upper stretch to race
from the far outside and never threatened. SPRITZER showed good early foot to set the pace and gave way. MY WAY OR NO WAY failed to sustain a bid
and was taken off the track on the Equine Ambulance.

STRIKE WHEN READY raced mid pack early on, between rivals on the turn, moved in by the quarter pole and then angled in by the furlong marker and
closed well on the inside to get up to prove best under all out pressure. TALES TO TELL stalked the pace, raced three to four wide and finished gamely to
the wire. ACQUALINA prompt the early leader two deep from the outside, raced four deep in the stretch and finished gamely to the wire. ASPEN DAWN
was taken back early on the inside, swung wide into the upper stretch and finished gamely to the wire. HOLLYWOODLAND set a pressured pace from the
inside and then came two wide off the turn and dug in leaving the three sixteenths marker and then faded in the final sixteenth. GASPARILLA raced three
wide near the five sixteenths pole, shifted out five wide and was even no final bid. JUSTIFYING VEGAS was allowed to settle early on, saved ground
through the far turn and lacked a response. SHE IS INVINCIBLE (GB) failed to sustain a bid.
