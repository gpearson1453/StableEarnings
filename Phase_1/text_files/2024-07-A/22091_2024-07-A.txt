with SPORTING THE GOLD from that point and prevailed under strong handling. SPORTING THE GOLD saved ground the the pace under pressure from
FILTHY RICH was unable to match strides with that one late but held on gamely during the drive. WARRIOR'S WAY OUT was unhurried early, came
four-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. MALIBU'S BOSS MAN was forwardly placed while racing three-wide and went evenly. RIDLEY PARK was
allowed to settled, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. LETSGETLUCKYTONITE saved ground while racing in the middle of the

Footnotes
MELODIOUS SINGER vied with ASHLEE'S RING for the lead from along the outside, shook that one off entering the stretch and increased her advantage.
LADRO DI FICHI was reserved off the pace, came three-wide into the stretch, split rivals nearing the eighth pole and finished well for second in a mild rally.
MUSKOKA SUMMER disputed the issue while racing three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and held on well for third in a steady effort. DEL REY
DOLLY was allowed to settle early, came three-wide into the stretch then angled further out nearing the eighth pole and was making up some ground late.
ASHLEE'S RING vied for the lead to the stretch from along the inside and tired late. PRUSSIAN BLUE dropped back while saving ground and failed to
threaten. MS MERRABEL was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to be a factor.

DWELLER set the pace in hand while racing removed from the inner rail and gradually drew clear. FOR CRYIN OUT LOUD saved ground while being
forwardly placed and finished well for second in a steady effort. FAIRY DREAMS prompted the pace into the stretch while three-wide and held on fairly well
for third. WARRIOR'S DEFENSE was prominently placed while racing four-wide on the turn but lacked a rally when asked. DAKOTA SPRINGS was
close-up early racing along the inside, dropped back on the turn and went evenly late. WILD GIRL dropped back while saving ground and was not a factor.
LADY AHAVA raced four-wide on the turn while being unhurried and failed to menace.

HARPER BE GOOD was reserved off the early pace, rallied five-wide into the stretch and finished fast to be up in the final strides. A PHILLY THING saved
ground stalking FACE IT ALONE early, angled out two-wide nearing the three-eighths pole, was brushed by that rival nearing the eighth pole then gained a
slight lead in deep stretch and just failed to last in a game try. FACE IT ALONE saved ground setting the pace, drifted out slightly nearing the eighth pole to
brush with A PHILLY THING and held on determinedly during the drive. TRECHMO GIRL was unhurried early, came six-wide into the stretch and rallied
late. KENTUCKY REIGN saved ground while racing in the middle of the field and went evenly. BIONIC KAT was forwardly placed early while racing
three-wide and tired. WARRIOR BERNICE dropped back while saving ground and was not a factor.
