EDDIE'S GIRL broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of SHE'S KINDA HOT in
the run down the backstretch, took control approaching the final turn, and widened her advantage through the final furlong while being kept to task. DUKE
GIRLS away alertly and tracked the leaders into the backside while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn,
and finished willingly while drifting four wide in deep stretch to get up for the place. SHE'S KIND OF HOT away well and dueled for the lead from the outside
of EDDIE'S GIRL entering the first turn, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch, was unable to keep tabs on her pace rival
nearing the final turn, and finished steadily from along the rail in the drive to just miss the place. DAZ LIN FORCE settled off the contested early pace while
racing one out from the rail in the run down the backside, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished evenly while racing one out from
the rail in the drive. FOREVER SUMMER unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a
serious late impact when called upon. A LITTLE MERCY NOW was in tight quarters while running off behind the leaders in the run to the first turn, settled
into a tracking trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

Footnotes
STANFORD BAY away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of RACING RIVER in the
run down the backstretch and through the final turn, got the better of his pace rival in mid stretch and drew clear to prove best. RACING RIVER broke
sharply and pressed the pace from the outside of STANFORD BAY in the run down the backside, continued to force the issue two wide through the final
turn, was unable to match strides with that foe in deep stretch, but battled gamely to hold the place. KNOPFLER stalked the leaders entering the backside
while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed determinedly from along the rail in the drive to just miss
the place. THERE GOES MY HERO settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the
inside entering the final turn, and finished evenly three wide in the drive. Y VEE R away well and tracked the leaders through the first turn, while steadying
off heels midway through the turn, held a tracking trip in the run down the backstretch, but faded over the final furlong, and wasn't persevered with late.
BECKETT'S BEST stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, dropped back to trail entering the final turn, and had little to
offer late.

BOLD ARCH broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backside and into the final
turn, and drew clear in the lane while being geared down late. CASCADE BILLY tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail,
rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, and while no match for the winner late, finished strongly two wide in the drive to prove clearly second best.
SMART LAD away well and settled at the back of a compact field while racing two wide into the backstretch, launched his bid one out from the rail entering
the final turn, and closed with late interest three wide in the drive to get up for a share. SET TO SHINE tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing
two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive but was unable to hold his position in the late going.
FINDING WAYS away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, struggled to maintain his position in the run to
the final turn, and faded while under a ride over the final furlong.

BAK TO LIBERTY broke sharply and tracked the leaders three wide through the stretch the first time, forced the issue two out from the rail in the run down
the backstretch, rallied smartly from the outside of SLOOP JOHN B entering the final turn, and got the better of that rival in the closing strides to prevail.
SLOOP JOHN B away well and vied for the lead from along the rail through the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run
down the backstretch, continued to battle for the lead through the final turn and into the lane, and just failed to last. TIME TICKER unhurried early while
dropping back to trail, launched his bid from just off the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive while gaining late. DESIRED
OUTCOME settled at the back of the pack while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, began to improve his position in the run down the
backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished full of run from along the rail in the stretch drive. MERRY BLUE tracked the contested early
pace from just off the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained her position in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final
turn, but lacked the needed closing response late while finishing three wide in the drive. PRINCE CAIRO settled off the early pace while racing one out from
the rail through the stretch the first time, began to gain ground four wide upon entering the backstretch, continued with a three wide bid entering the final
turn, but needed more when called upon in the drive. WISELY PLAYED stalked the early pace while racing mid pack through the stretch the first time, was
unable to hold his position in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact. WHEN IN MEXICO away
alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of SLOOP JOHN B through the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down
the backside, was unable to keep tabs on his pace rival approaching the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.
