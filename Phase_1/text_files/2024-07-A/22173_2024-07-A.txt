Footnotes
MY HONEYBUNCH was off slowly and steadied, rushed up outside into contention on the backside, chased on the turn, rallied outside of STREET
CHARITY into the stretch, gradually wore down that rival, took over past the sixteenth marker and drew clear under urging. STREET CHARITY rated the
pace early on, showed the way along the inside, responded when roused turning for home, dug in gamely inside of the winner and then yielded to that rival.
YUMYUM EAT EM UP raced off the pace, chased on the turn, came four wide into the lane and rallied mildly for third. MARYVIC tracked inside, chased
inside on the turn, raced between rivals at the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. DIGITAL CURRENCY stalked close up outside early on, chased on
the turn and faded. FANCY'S ROSEBUD broke open the gate prior, raced off the pace and dropped far back on the turn.
