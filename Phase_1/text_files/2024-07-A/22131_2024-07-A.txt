Footnotes
SIS BOOM BOB sprinted clear at once, stayed well clear under good handling and held sway to the wire. AFFICIONADO (FR) chased top pair to the
stretch, rallied along for place no match. SASSY AND BOLD unhurried to the stretch rallied along steadily for show spot. CINQUE AMORE chased winner to
deep stretch, faltered in the late going. PRINCESSTAPITURE slow into stride to the turn, improved position in the stretch. ROYAL TO BE never a factor
throughout. MY TOMMY LEE failed to menace throughout. HIGH MEADOWS never threatened throughout. SURE ENOUGH slow into stride between
horses, saved ground from the turn.
