SHADOW BOX vied inside rival, shook loose near the five sixteenths pole, moved clear and lasted. MODERN MIDAS lacked speed, advanced inside,
angled out late with a rush. PORSUPUESTO broke very slowly and raced far behind then closed well outside. MIL DOSCIENTOS pressed the winner to
midway on the turn and faded. SUMMER ASH dropped far back and caught stopping rival late. ROCKIN FREEBEE was urged within striking range early
then stopped abruptly.

prompted the pace outside then weakened in the stretch. DIXIE MUSIC dropped far back then passed rivals without menacing. SO STEADY trailed for half
a mile and never menaced. VICTORIOUSVICTORIA raced wide off the leaders and faltered. NORHO'S GAMBLE dropped back early and was always
