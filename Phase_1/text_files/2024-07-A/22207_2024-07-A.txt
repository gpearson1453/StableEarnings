LUCKY LORRAINE saved ground around the first turn, settled off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path,
launched a bid between horses in upper stretch and kicked clear late. CAGED PIXIE raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the
inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the second bend, dueled in the lane and was caught late. PARTY MONSTER was reluctant to load, raced in
the three path early, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path around the second turn, and dug in while drifting out in
the final furlong but was caught late. NURSE RACHETT dueled on the inside through the opening half mile, continued to battle from the two path coming
around the far turn and weakened in the lane. TWO MINUTE LICK raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of
the pack between horses, swung out to the four path coming around the far turn and never threatened. MY BOSS LADY raced in the four path early, settled
in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run on the backstretch, came around the far turn in the five path and faded from there. VODKATINI was
squeezed back leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, dropped far back coming around the
second bend and was not a factor.

Footnotes
LUV YA BYE BYE tracked the pace from the inside, saved all the ground around the bend, asked to quicken while angling off the inside in upper stretch,
kicked away under a drive. WENDELL FONG slow into stride, unhurried towards the rear into the turn, came under a drive while seven wide in upper
stretch, rallied late for the place. RED DEVOLUTION chased the pace between runners into the turn, bid between nearing the quarter pole, leveled off
through the wire. MY BEAU set a pressured pace along the inside, under constant outside pressure around the turn, took the lead to the furlong marker, and
gave way from there. CLASSY SOLUTION chased the top pair into the turn, put to a drive four wide around the bend, had no late kick.
LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA was slow away from the gate, unable to gain momentum around the bend, never threatened. ALTA FOX vied from the two path
into the turn, under pressure nearing the quarter pole, weakened through the stretch while running on his left lead.
