Footnotes
HORSEPOWER broke a step slow, moved up on his own to stalk the pacesetter, tracked that rival on the turn, rallied two wide into the stretch, took over,
kicked clear and then held well under urging late. BE THERE raced two wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane, closed well late outside and was
gaining at the end. EGYPTIAN QUEST was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, moved up on the turn, angled out, rallied between horses and got
the nod for third. BIG Z OG was bumped at the start, chased inside, chased on the turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch and just missed for the show spot.
SEBASTIANTHE FIRST chased three wide early, then two wide on the turn and rallied mildly between foes. MAXIMILLIONS DREAM showed good early
speed to set the pace, dueled into the stretch, dug in and gave way in the final sixteenth. BLUE MARBLE raced off the pace, inside on the turn and did not
factor. CURLIN'S HUSTLE was off slowly and steadied, then outrun.

LIVE HIGH LIVE LOW raced three wide early, stalked close up two wide, bid two wide on the turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, moved up alongside of
ADIOS BUCCANEER nearing the furlong marker, took over and kicked away in the final sixteenth. FRIZZANTE tracked close up on the inside, saved
ground on the far turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch and closed for second. ADIOS BUCCANEER set the pace racing with a clear lead, raced in the two
path turning for home, dug in gamely in the stretch drive and yielded grudgingly late. RAPTURE BAY stalked outside a rival, chased on the far turn, lacked a
winning bid and finished evenly for fourth. ICE THE KICKER raced off the pace with an inside trip and had no rally. PAL raced off the pace inside, came
three wide into the lane and failed to threaten. ARROW SPEED raced two wide off the pace, chased two wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. HARD
SPUN FANTASY raced two wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane and did not factor.

IMAGINIZED was bumped at the start, stalked early, moved up on the first turn to take over, set the pace racing off the inside, turned back a bid from LONG
ASTRIDE on the far turn, responded when roused past the quarter pole, drew clear and held well under urging. CAJUN VIBES broke sharply and led in the
early stages, then tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn, re rallied on the rail in the final furlong and earned the place spot. LONG ASTRIDE broke
out bumping a rival at the start, raced three wide on the first turn, then stalked between rivals, bid two wide on the far turn, could not stay with the winner,
then dug in between rivals late and held third. THE HEIGHTS brushed the gate and was off slowly, raced five wide early, settled off the pace, chased three
wide on the far turn, rallied outside in the stretch and was outkicked for the minor placings. SMOOTH PLAYER was bumped hard at the start, raced four
wide early, stalked three wide, chased on the far turn and tired. ROSSINGTON was bumped hard and steadied at the start, then outrun. NO SURRENDER
reluctant to load, raced off the pace with an inside trip and gave way.
