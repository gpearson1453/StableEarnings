Footnotes
GUIDE MY STEPS was allowed to settle from the break, tracked three to four wide down the backstretch, made a nice mid-race move through the turn, still
wide, then swung five wide into the stretch continued to run on well down the lane under steady handling and intermittent urging, fended off a late challenge
from SMOOVE AS SILK and just lasted. SMOOVE AS SILK was a little slow to get started but made an early forward move to get into a stalking position
behind AIRKITA, launched a bid from the quarter pole and came into the stretch three wide of four horses across the track, finished willingly and was slowly
gaining on GUIDE MY STEPS to the wire but came up short. HOLLYWOOD RUMOR broke well and was up close in the early stages before dropping back
a bit, tracked inside, saved all the ground into the stretch, came under a ride to keep up with the rest leaving the five-sixteenths pole but was unable to
threaten the top pair, kept to task and was a clear third. AIRKITA was quickest away, cleared off early then took some pressure from SMOOVE AS SILK
from the half mile pole, held on to the lead through the turn then fought back briefly near the quarter pole when challenged, was unable to match strides late
and finished evenly. MISTICAL SURPRISE was outrun from the break, dropped out of contention before the turn and was never a factor from that point.

Footnotes
GOLF DRAMA away from the gate in good order, ceded the early front and stalked PARK ROAD COWBOY through moderate fractions heading into the
turn, pressured PARK ROAD COWBOY from a four wide path into the bend, was repelled into upper stretch and chased to the furlong marker, re-rallied
past mid-stretch and drew to even terms with PARK ROAD COWBOY nearing the sixteenth-marker, wore down the runner-up in deep stretch and edged
away in the final strides to prove best. PARK ROAD COWBOY sent away from the start, assumed early command and dictated terms heading to the quarter
marker, set a moderate pace while traveling in the three path entering the turn, was pressured by GOLF DRAMA approaching the quarter pole, shook free
of that rival into the stretch and led to the furlong marker, was confronted again by GOLF DRAMA nearing the sixteenth-marker, could not hold off of the
determined winner in deep stretch and was well clear of the rest for second. HOT JOURNEY stumbled sharply at the start and was away slowly from the
gate, settled off of the decent early pace, saved ground into the turn and improved position at the quarter pole, maintained an inside path into the stretch,
could not impact the top two in the drive and was a clear third. R HEART OF GOLD tracked the decent early pace from the outside, was well placed into the
turn and tracked three to four wide nearing the quarter marker, was outrun into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. BIG STICK chased the decent
early pace from between rivals, shifted to the inside and chased inside to two wide into the turn and ran in pursuit heading to the quarter pole, could not
keep pace into the stretch and gave way. THE FUSS broke slowly, settled off of the decent early pace while never far back, guided two to three wide into
the turn, trailed to the quarter pole and lacked a response in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
TITOS WITH A TWIST veered out at the start and bothered ARTEMUS GORDON, then moved up to gain a stalking position behind and to the outside of
ELCONDOR, went to challenge the latter for the lead near the quarter pole, pulled even but had trouble getting by at the top of the stretch as that rival
fought back, gained the advantage in deep stretch and pulled clear in the final yards. ELCONDOR broke sharply and went straight to the front with the rest
close behind, held sway through the turn then battled back gamely when TITOS WITH A TWIST mounted a challenge from the quarter pole, hung in to
mid-stretch then gave way but kept on to just hold the place. COUNT ASHER lacked speed from the break then was ridden to keep close to the pack down
the backstretch, struggled to keep pace through the turn despite being under a steady drive, kept to the two path through the turn, was kept to task, found
another gear late and was gaining some in the late stages. TOO MUCH INFO outrun through the early stages, started a late rally through the turn then
responded to a vigorous ride from the three furlong marker to improve late while no threat to the winner. ARTEMUS GORDON got squeezed and took up at
the start when both the inside and outside horses converged in the path, raced mid-pack in the three path through the turn and into the stretch, finished
one-paced through the stretch. CATCHME AT THELAKE broke in at the start and made contact with TITOS WITH A TWIST, also bothering ARTEMUS
GORDON, raced a bit erratically through the first furlong ending up in the five to six path in the run down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn the
started to weaken before the quarter pole and came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
KIKI KRAZY was sent to establish the early lead, showed the way into the first turn from a two wide path, set decent fractions while well handled through the
backstretch run, drew to a clear lead nearing the quarter marker and extended the lead into the stretch, kept to task past mid-stretch, was hand urged in the
final sixteenth and maintained a clear lead into deep stretch to hold sway. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS settled off of the early pace and went two to three wide
and between rivals into the first turn, advanced along the backstretch run and was well placed approaching the half-mile, chased two wide into the far turn
and advanced at the quarter pole, chased KIKI KRAZY into the stretch and was outkicked at the furlong marker, was able to narrow the winner's margin into
the final sixteenth but could not impact KIKI KRAZY in the late stages and was second best. SHANGHAI MIST forwardly placed away from the start, tracked
the early pace from a three wide path into the first turn, advanced into the backstretch run and was well placed while widest nearing the half-mile, chased
three to four wide to the quarter pole, could not match strides with the leading pair in the stretch run and was clear for third at the finish. DORINE'S WILD
CAT allowed to settle away from the start, saved ground into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run while not far back, chased three wide
into the far turn, needed more into the stretch and passed tiring rivals in the final furlong. STATEFOREST was prominent away from the start, stalked the
early pace from a two to three wide path along the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and chased the decent pace nearing the half-mile
marker, ran in pursuit three wide into the far turn, dropped back leaving the quarter pole and gave way in the final furlong. GEA unhurried away from the
start, raced outside of rivals into the first turn, was content to trail nearing the half-mile marker while not far back, went four wide into the second turn and
lost ground nearing the quarter marker, was outrun into the stretch and did not factor in the late stages. SHEZARUNAWAY settled off of the early pace and
saved ground into the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and tracked the decent pace approaching the half-mile marker, saved ground into
the far turn and chased heading to the quarter pole, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired in the final furlong. This race was originally hand timed
and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time

Footnotes
BABY KRISTEN broke sharply then angled over to the inside after clearing the field, set a pressured pace though under a hard hold from the rider, extended
the lead through the turn then opened up at the head of the stretch responded to steady handling and won clear. ELEGANT SWAY broke alertly, was not
asked for speed and was allowed to settle from the break, tracked three wide then launched a bid from the three furlong marker, came into the stretch with
good momentum, finished well, but proved no match for the winner while finishing well clear of the next horse. DRAW ME raced in the back of the compact
field down the backstretch, tipped out to about the six path for the stretch run and produced a mild rally to get the third spot near the wire. ICONIC SKY
came away from the gate awkwardly then in the course of correcting made some contact with SMILE BABY SMILE a few yards away from the gate, then
raced between horses early on while chasing BABY KRISTEN through the early fractions, kicked on from the three furlong marker, chased the winner home
and weakened some in the final furlong. SMILE BABY SMILE broke inward then took up while making contact with ICONIC SKY a few yards into the race,
then became rank and hard to place during the run down the backstretch, settled down once in the the turn, came under a ride from the seven-sixteenths
pole but was unable to muster a rally and could not improve. SUNGLASSES (GB) broke well and raced just behind BABY KRISTEN through the early
stages, pressed the pace through the turn, then could not keep up when that rival opened up on the turn, came under a drive from the five-sixteenths pole,
was still in the running for a minor award in mid-stretch but was outfinished in the final furlong. SWIFT NONNI raced close up through the early stages,
began to struggle at the halfway point, dropped off the pace and was outrun the rest of the way.

Footnotes
MIO BAMBINO hopped at the start and was off a bit slowly, was allowed to settle in the early running, guided three wide into the turn and improved position
at the quarter marker, was full of run into the stretch, split rivals past the furlong pole, took command into the final sixteenth and edged away in deep stretch
to prevail in a good debut. I AM AMADEO settled off of the moderate early pace, was guided two wide into the turn and lost position nearing the quarter
marker, slipped to the rail into upper stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, rallied into the final sixteenth, was outkicked by MIO BAMBINO in
deep stretch and held safely at the finish for second. BLAZING PEME showed early speed leaving the start, engaged with BEGIN AGAIN and contested the
moderate pace inside of that rival heading to the half-mile marker, disputed the pace into the turn and pressed BEGIN AGAIN nearing the quarter pole, took
command into the stretch and shook free at the furlong marker, could not hold off the top pair entering the final sixteenth and just held for third at the finish.
ELEGANT BOY settled off of the decent early pace, was guided two to three wide along the turn, angled six wide into the stretch and gained ground while
widest at the furlong marker, closed willingly into the final sixteenth and just missed for third at the finish. DRINKS AT THE CLUB was squeezed leaving the
start and was away a bit slowly, settled off of the moderate early pace, ran in pursuit two wide nearing the quarter marker, shifted four wide into upper
stretch and gained ground at the furlong pole, closed into the final sixteenth and just missed for third on the wire. NIGHTBIRDE IT'S OK was prominent
away from the start, chased the early leading pair from the inside heading to the half-mile marker, shifted to the three path entering the turn and gained
ground at the quarter pole, ran in pursuit three to four wide into the stretch and continued to gain ground at the furlong pole, needed more into the final
sixteenth and was outkicked in deep stretch. SARK off a step slowly leaving the start, was hustled in the early stages and chased the moderate pace from
the outside heading to the half-mile marker, raced four to five wide into the turn and was well placed at the quarter pole, was outkicked into the stretch and
weakened in the final furlong. BEGIN AGAIN broke alertly, engaged with BLAZING PEME in the early going and contested a moderate early pace while
outside of that rival, took a narrow lead into the turn and led while two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, vied for the lead into the stretch, could not
keep pace past the furlong marker and faded in the final sixteenth. CATCH A BREEZE was erratic away from the start and bucked twice leaving the gate,
spotted the field in the early running and trailed throughout.
