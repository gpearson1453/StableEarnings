AWESOME RUTA raced four wide early, stalked three wide, bid four wide midway on the far turn, rallied to a short lead in upper stretch and then drew clear
under urging. REAL SENSATION vied two wide for the early lead, then three wide at the half mile marker, dueled three wide on the far turn, dug in gamely
in the stretch drive and came up second best. K CROWN stalked close up between rivals, moved up between horses to contest the pace at the half mile
marker, dueled between rivals on the far turn and weakened in the final furlong. PIRATE was steadied a bit at the start, trailed the field, was asked on the far
turn, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. GOODSTONE vied inside for the lead, pulled some while setting the pace on the backside, dueled on
the far turn and faded. ROSE COLLECTOR bobbled at the break, raced close up on the rail, chased inside on the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
THE DISTRACTOR stalked close up outside, chased on the turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, moved up alongside HURRICANE J at the eighth pole,
dueled with the rivals past the sixteenth marker and then edged away late. HURRICANE J showed good speed to set the pace racing in the two path, edged
away on the turn, dug in gamely inside of the winner in the stretch drive, dueled with that rival to deep stretch and yielded grudgingly. FLYING LIAM settled
off the early pace, chased three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane, bid outside rivals and finished evenly. GOOD JUJU trailed the field, moved
up at the quarter pole and gained mildly outside in the lane. HUSHION chased close up early on the rail, chased on the turn and tired.

CHARLIE'S EXPRESS stalked the pacesetter, bid two wide on the turn, led into the stretch, responded when challenged at the eighth pole, turned away that
rival and drew clear under urging for the win. RUNNING RIGHT BY U stalked outside, chased and steadied midway on the turn, came four wide into the
lane, rallied outside, bid at the furlong marker, then proved second best. ALPHA COMPANY raced off the pace inside, angled out entering the stretch,
rallied mildly outside and was up late for third. DR. DOYLE bobbled at the break, raced three wide off the pace, then moved up inside on the turn, rallied
between horses in upper stretch, then flattened out and lost third late. ON THE COME UP showed good early speed to set the pace, dueled with the winner
at the quarter pole and faded in the stretch. MIDNIGHT STORY raced two wide off the pace and did not factor.

Footnotes
SENOR PICKLES raced off the rail, off the early pace, made a strong three wide bid midway on the turn, took charge, pulled away and was ridden out.
MOMENT AT SEA chased the pace, chased on the turn, came two wide into the lane, rallied and closed well late for second. AVES MAKIN' WAVES dueled
two wide for the lead, dueled on the turn, dug in to midstretch, then weakened and lost second. CHOCHOCHO hesitated and was off slowly, raced off the
pace inside and gained some ground in the stretch. JOEL'S BOY raced off the pace, came wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. EXCALIBRATE
dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn and faded.
