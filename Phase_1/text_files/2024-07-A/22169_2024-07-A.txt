Footnotes
EUCLID AVENUE hopped at the start then rushed up to a clear lead through the final turn then was headed in upper stretch but dug back in and drew off to
prove best. ANCIENT MAN raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then steadily advanced down the backstretch then angled out to three wide
on the final turn to engage the leader at the top of the stretch but was no match for the winner. STOLICH raced off the pace while saving ground down
through the final turn then made a mild bid at the top of the stretch but was empty. CHARLIE'S BEACH went five wide into the first turn then settled in the
middle of the pack down the backstretch, moved out to four wide around the final turn but failed to menace. JUSTICEONEMORETIME tracked the leaders
while racing close up to midway through the final turn but lacked the late response. ARMAVIR hopped at the start spotting the field several lengths, trailed
the field to midway through the final turn but was never a threat. MASQUERADE BALL was forwardly placed around the first turn then dropped back and
was not a factor. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

SHACKLEFORD STRONG co-led inside of I'M WIDE AWAKE to the turn then edged away but was re-engaged and dueled down the stretch but was able to
clear late for the win. I'M WIDE AWAKE co-led outside of SHACKLEFORD STRONG to the turn then fell back slightly but came again to duel down the
stretch but weakened. PHILIPSBURG (IRE) showed no early speed but moved between horses in the final yards for a late rally to be up for the show. SAND
MOUNTAIN chased the leaders from three wide and tired. RED LABEL raced four wide through the turn then shifted in to two wide at the quarter pole but
lacked a bid.

Footnotes
LAST MINUTE sprinted to a early pressured lead then edged away on the turn and won going away. LA PERFECT BEE raced near the back early then
made a rail bid on the turn but had to steady in mid turn, shifted out to three wide and regained action to make the late bid in the stretch to be up for the
place. MIDTERM pressed the pace while saving ground, floated out in upper stretch and weakened late. HONORANDPRINCIPLE raced off the pace then
made a mild two wide bid on the turn but lacked the late response needed. PONCHO ATTACK trailed the field through the turn and passed tiring rivals.
UNCLE CHUCKLE was forwardly placed from four wide to the turn then angled in to save ground around the turn but was not a factor. NAGY AND DA
BEARS was forwardly placed from five wide to the turn then tipped in to three wide around the turn and angled in at the quarter pole but failed to menace.

Footnotes
SALLY'S SUPRISE vied for the lead from the inside to the five furlong marker then raced off the pace around the turn but engaged the leader at the quarter
pole, brushed with DEVIL in upper stretch and drifted in slightly near the eighth pole but kept on and drew clear. PRINCESS TENKO trailed the field to the
turn then made a rail bid into the stretch for the rally. SECRET OPERATION pressed the pace from two wide to the five furlong marker then angled out to
three wide at the half mile marker, moved up to engage the leader at the quarter pole, drifted in slightly near the eighth pole but weakened. DEVIL went to a
pressured lead early from between horses then edged clear on the turn but was eclipsed at the quarter pole and brushed with SALLY'S SUPRISE in upper
stretch and gave way grudgingly. SUPRISE ME AGAIN was within striking distance while racing off the rail on the backstretch, angled out to four wide at the
quarter pole but lacked the late response. RESOLUTION was not involved. A JOCKEY'S OBJECTION WAS POSTED, THE JOCKEY OF DEVIL CLAIMED
FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY'S OF SALLYS SUPRISE AND SECRET OPERATION FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE,
AFTER A STEWARDS REVIED THE CLAIM OF FOUL WAS DISALLOWED AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
GUANA CAY raced in the middle of the pack from off the rail through the final turn then moved between horses at the eighth pole for the late rally and
cleared in the final yards. BABY GUNDIN was forwardly placed from two wide down the backstretch then tipped out to four wide in upper stretch and made
the late gain to be up for the place. TRAIL RIDGE ROAD raced off the pace from the two path down the backstretch, moved up to collar the leader into the
stretch and took a brief lead but couldn't fend off the late closers and weakened. WHITE LIES was allowed to settled through the final turn then moved out
to five or six wide near the eighth pole and made a late bid but was not enough. CAT ATTACK roused to a clear lead to set most of the pace but was caught
in upper stretch and gave way. JOURNEYIST tracked the leaders from the inside to midway down the backstretch then launched a rail bid near the nine
sixteenths pole through the turn and was empty in the stretch drive. COTTON CANDY ANNIE stalked the pace from three wide around the first turn then
retreated. AMAZON QUEEN was unhurried and not a threat.

Footnotes
KING ANTHONY stalked the pace from the inside to upper stretch then angled out to two wide at the eighth pole to run down the leader and drew clear late.
GOOD APPLE was hustled to a clear lead to deep stretch but was caught late but kept on to be second best. HOPPIN JOHN was unhurried down the
backstretch then made a mild bid on the turn, angled out to five wide in upper stretch, shifted in down the stretch for the late rally to be up for show.
VALIANT WEST tracked the leaders from two wide on the backstretch then moved out to three wide at the half mile marker, fell back on the turn but made a
mid track rebid in the stretch to improve position. STRANGE ARRANGE broke well then settled off the pace but couldn't catch the leader and weakened.
MY CRAZY NEIGHBOR was forwardly placed from four wide to the turn then retreated. MOONLIGHT ROAD trailed the field early then steadily advanced
from two wide through the turn but failed to sustain that bid. FAMILY TRADITION saved ground to no avail.

the clear lead down the backstretch then was headed midway through the final turn and was no match for the winner. WILDCAT BOBBIE trailed the field

Footnotes
THE RIDGE split horses early to take a pressured lead then inched away on the turn and was kept to task in the drive. SENDEMDOWNTHEROAD vied for
the early lead from three wide then tipped in to two wide on the turn but couldn't catch the winner and was best of the rest. LARRY'S LUNCHBOX stalked
the pace from four wide through the turn then made a late stretch bid to be up for show. KEYSER raced in the middle of the pack from two wide through the
turn then made a late inside bid and missed the show. RAISERICHIESRANSOM raced in the middle of the pack on the inside then shifted out to four wide
at the eighth pole but was not a threat. MY BROTHER MIKE was void of speed and failed to menace. LUCKY PAL showed brief early speed to press the
pace to the three furlong marker and faded. LORD BLOCK showed no speed and no contention.
