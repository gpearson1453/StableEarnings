MOONBRIGHT was off a step slow, a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch drew clear. REMEMBEROLDTYMES showed speed
from the inside, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held place. LOUEMMA was away alertly and roused from the inside
on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. BIG BELL was unhurried early, hustled along on the turn and from the seven path
through the stretch finished evenly. MY GIRL GABBY was off the pace, showed little and was never in contention.

outward and closed the gap on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. ALMONTE PRINCESS was away alertly
and had a slim lead on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch gave way. I'M PHANTOM showed speed from the inside and forced the pace
on the turn but had nothing left. FAITHFUL GIFT was up close and dueled from between foes on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch
weakened. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON TACHYON SPEED AGAINST PRINCESS BU CHERRO FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE

KNOTTY AND NICE set the pace, had a clear lead on the far turn and was much the best. IT'S ME tracked the early leader, had a good position on the far
turn and was clearly second best. LUCKY LOUISE was in touch and roused from the inside on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch
was no real threat. WAR VOW was well back, closed the gap on the far turn and was up for a share. FEROCIOUS QUEEN was off slow and showed little in
a dull effort. ALWAYS MY FAULT was off slow, chased on the far turn and was empty.

Footnotes
SPEEDY JOHNY was in touch, moved up on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. JIMMY IS A BREEZE was
unhurried early, had a mild gain on the turn and was up for place. BELLASPINA showed speed from the outside and had the lead on the turn but from the
three path at the top of the stretch gave way. T'PRING was in range and roused on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more.
LULU'S LULLABY was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but was no real threat. LOADED SECRET stalked the early leader and was a factor on
the turn but had no late kick. CREATIVPERFORMANCE was off the pace and hustled along on the turn but from the eight path at the top of the stretch was
empty.

Footnotes
WILBERFORCE was in mid pack, had a good position on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch drew clear. GUS'S GAMBLE tracked
the early leaders and was a factor on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. THY KINGDOM was unhurried
early, saved ground on the far turn, angled outside in mid stretch and was up for show. HARDWARE GAP was in range and raced evenly on the far turn but
from the six path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. BAJAN BULLET set the pace and had a slim lead on the far turn but gave way in mid stretch.
BAIT N SWITCH was well back, had a mild gain on the far turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch passed tired foes. TWO YEAR CONTRACT
was in touch but chased on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch had no rally. I LIVE BY FAITH stalked the early leader and dueled on
the far turn but dropped back through the stretch. SANTIAGO SALSA was off the pace, showed little and had no impact.
