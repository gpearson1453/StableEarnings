Footnotes
HOP AWAY HOTTIE was forwardly placed soon after the start and raced behind the early leader, moved up to engage INCA STROLL entering the turn,
battled on for the lead into the stretch, shook clear approaching the sixteenth pole and held firm. FLAT OUT ROSE tracked the top pair into the turn, hustled
along three wide entering the head of the lane, sustained a steady bid and edged closer nearing the wire. CUPIDS SWEETY raced in contention along the
inside up the backstretch, was ridden along the rail around the turn, angled out a path in late stages and got up for show in final stride. INCA STROLL sped
to the lead at the start and set the pace up the backstretch, took on the challenge of HOP AWAY HOTTIE entering the turn, vied with eventual winner into
the lane, fought back from the inside then weakened in the final sixteenth.
