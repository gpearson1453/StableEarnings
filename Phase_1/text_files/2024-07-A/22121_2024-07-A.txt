Footnotes
BELLA PRIMA raced in the two path between horses on the turn, floated to the three path in upper stretch, rallied between rivals and was up approaching
the finish. MAKE IT A DOUBLE circled horses on the turn, was fanned four deep in upper stretch, remained on her left lead, bid for the lead late and hung.
GOLDEN CAN stumbled at the break, chased the pace in the two path around the turn, reached a striking position near the sixteenth pole then weakened.
FORGOTTEN GIFT sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and faltered in the drive. ANAITA saved ground around the turn, was well
positioned turning for home and gave way. THEODORA GRACE trailed.

Footnotes
ENTRUST stalked inside, eased out under coaxing past the five sixteenths, worked his way forward while four wide and between runners past the three
sixteenths, closed in under left handed asks and collared the leader near the sixteenth pole, dueled, gained a slim advantage late then edged away a bit at
the wire. WHATAHARDMANFIDEAD , four wide to contention, dropped in a path heading to the far turn and responded when given his cue, rolled up three
deep and took over leaving the five sixteenths, shifted in towards the rail while clear in upper stretch, kept on under a drive leaving the furlong grounds, dug
in when confronted and dueled to late then gave way grudgingly inside the winner. MONEY ROOM , bumped soundly and outward by LAW OF THE
JUNGLE leaving the gate, was pinched soon after, recovered to settle off the inside, chased in the clear leaving the three eighths, angled out and circled
five wide into the lane, ranged up under pressure near mid stretch then flattened out late. LAW OF THE JUNGLE bore out at the break and bumped with
MONEY ROOM, straightened and settled while saving ground, edged up behind foes then briefly steadied towards the rail in upper stretch, eased out to
work between runners then churned on. ARMY CADET stalked two wide under early rating, bid between foes nearing the five sixteenths, chased into the
lane then faded through the final furlong. RUBYS FLASH was angled in as he sped clear into the first turn, set the pace towards the inside, was joined by a
pair of outer foes near the five sixteenths, stayed willingly to the three sixteenths then weakened. BRIGHT FORECAST , three wide early, stalked the pace
into the backstretch, was under a ride nearing the half, faltered around the final turn, was eased through the final three sixteenths then walked off.

Footnotes
BOURBON WILDCAT broke a step slow, regrouped and edged up in hand while five wide heading to the half, dropped in a path and bid to engage the
leader from her outside past the five sixteenths, dueled, wrested command leaving the three sixteenths then drew away on her left lead while under a drive
to late. STOP THE CAP saved ground off the early pace, eased out mid turn then advanced four wide into the stretch, shifted out wider near mid stretch and
churned on to gain the place through the final yards. BANDITS WARRIOR came away from the gate in forward fashion despite a stumbled, disputed the
pace three deep into the turn, spurted clear leaving the three eighths, met an outside bid from the winner leaving the five sixteenths, sparred inside that one
past mid stretch then faded late. BOUND BY DESTINY dropped back off the pace while about three wide, swung out seven wide for the drive and got past
tiring rivals. ANGELOFCANTERBURY , away alertly, raced four wide pursuing the leading trio, failed to kick on under a ride mid turn and weakened. R
AVERIE LYNN sped up to the inside of rivals to gain a slim early advantage, battled with an outer pair into the turn, failed to keep pace past the five
sixteenths and weakened. VELVET VIXEN broke a bit slow, was hustled up two wide between runners to contest the early pace, lacked a punch leaving mid
turn and weakened.

Footnotes
BERMUDA RUN made the early lead, hugged the inner rail, opened up turning for home, remained along the rail and was kept under encouragement in the
drive. ORIGINAL IDEA stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, circled the turn three deep, floated four wide entering the stretch and rallied
slightly. SHRUG stalked the pace along the inner rail, eased off the rail leaving the far turn, remained on his left lead in the stretch and gave way.
OWHATANITE stumbled at the start, stayed slightly off the inner rail around the turn and was not a serious factor. LITTLE CAGEFIGHTER prompted the
pace outside the winner and gave way in upper stretch. HOT ON YOUR HEELS bore out sharply leaving the starting gate then trailed.

Footnotes
THIS IS GOOD , two wide pursuing, dropped in towards the rail and edged up under coaxing leaving the far turn, steadied briefly off heels near the three
eighths, regrouped and was maneuvered outward and advanced to the inside of a rival, straightened away four wide then closed under a drive, spurted
clear of dueling inner rivals in mid stretch, extended her advantage heading to the sixteenth marker then held firm while confidently handled through the final
fifty yards. RAPIDITY stalked three wide, took closer order leaving the far turn, dropped back a bit past the five sixteenths, found more leaving the three
sixteenths and closed between rivals to gain the place. BRIGHTY broke a step slow then steadied soon after, regrouped to advance four wide into the turn,
ranged up while fanned five wide into the stretch, straightened and continued chase leaving mid stretch and churned on. MISTER MITCH broke outward,
righted and tracked three then two wide, moved up to engage the leader past the five sixteenths, dueled into the lane, stayed on past mid stretch then faded
late. WATCH OUT WORLD forced out some at the break, sped clear soon after, dropped in towards the rail to set the pace, was joined leaving the five
sixteenths, battled past mid stretch then weakened a bit late. SILENT ROAR drafted back off the early pace, raced four wide in upper stretch and failed to
menace. IFEELBADFORYOUSON , between foes soon after the start, was shuffled back leaving the five eighths, saved ground leaving the far turn and
failed to menace. NATTY BUMPPO dropped back off the early pace, was shoved along two wide past the three eighths, failed to kick on and faded through
the drive.

ODINSON set the pace along the inner rail around the turn, came off the rail in upper stretch, drifted out the final sixteenth and lasted. ONE WHIRLWIND
RIDE , four deep on the turn, chased the winner through the stretch while on his left lead and finished evenly. S S SINATRA stumbled leaving the starting
gate, was snugly rated into the turn, raced in the three path around the bend and finished willingly. DISPUTED CLAIM lacked speed, swung to the five path
in upper stretch and passed a tired horse. THUNDER LAD chased the pace in the two path around the turn and weakened. HAPPY JAUNT stayed along
the inner rail most of the race and was no factor.

Footnotes
FREEZE THE FIRE grabbed the early advantage and was guided down towards the inner rail, handled outside pressure while nursed along into and around
the turn, spurted clear of NO EASY DAYS after being put to a solid ride into the stretch, was guided outward when rejoined by that one leaving the sixteenth
marker, kept on tenaciously under right handed asks and grittily prevailed. NO EASY DAYS broke inward and bumped with DEVIL PAYS IN GOLD,
corrected and prompted the pace outside the winner, wandered outward to about the four path into the stretch, straightened with right hand asks and battled
back inside the sixteenth marker, drew alongside to duel in deep stretch and just missed in a sharp effort. PATIENT CAPITAL , off the pace while saving
ground, gathered some momentum while under a ride past the five sixteenths, remained inside through the drive and churned on. DEVIL PAYS IN GOLD ,
bumped inward the break, straightened and settled four wide, was nudged along five wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. PRINCE OF IRON , coaxed
along three wide stalking the embattled leaders, remained off the rail into the lane, lacked a punch nearing mid stretch and faded. CONTEMPT stumbled at
the break, recovered and edged up between foes near the five eighths, failed to kick on entering the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
DAILY PLANET bobbled at the break, stalked the pace, hugged the inner rail around the turn and in upper stretch, altered course to the outside of
MARLEY'S GHOST near the eighth pole, stayed on her left lead, led late and drove clear. MARLEY'S GHOST stalked the pace down the backstretch,
advanced along the inner rail to gain the lead leaving the turn, drifted out entering the stretch, drifted in approaching the eighth pole and weakened in the
drive. BAD TEMPER lacked speed, swung six deep turning for home and passed tired horses. LOVING CUP broke a bit awkwardly, raced inside horses
through the stretch and was no factor. MYSISTERNANCY set the pace in the two path around the turn and gave way. SULLIVAN STREET stumbled at the
break, chased the pace three wide on the turn and faltered.
