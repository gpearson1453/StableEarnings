Footnotes
LOVE MAMI LOVE had her head turned at the start then was in a bit tight soon after, raced off the pace inside, moved up two wide between foes around the
far turn, surged to the front nearing the sixteenth pole and quickly cleared. FOURWAY STOP set the pace along the rail, led to the sixteenth pole and just
lasted for the place. FREE TO ROAM raced off the early pace two wide, edged closer three wide around the far turn, angled four wide near the quarter pole,
had aim through the lane but was one-paced and just missed the place. BONMATI broke a bit awkwardly, saved ground in range, edged closer at the rail
around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and was outfinished. KILKENNY BELLA saved ground and failed to menace. ORO ORO bumped with
SEEKINGBYTHESTORM at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled four wide in upper stretch and lacked a rally. DIALITHIC chased the pace three
wide and weakened in the drive. MY HAPPY HOLIDAY played no factor while racing two and three wide. JUST MERCY was outrun while racing two wide.
SEEKINGBYTHESTORM bumped at the start, pressed the pace two wide and retreated around the far turn.

Footnotes
ETRURIAN hopped at the start but got sent to set the pace in the two path, received a right handed cue midway around the turn, kicked away in upper
stretch, and held firm. NEOPRENE raced off the pace in the five path, was ridden in the four path around the turn, swung from the six path into the lane, and
ran on for place. SPICY GUACAMOLE stalked in the five path, was coaxed along in the four path around the turn, and finished evenly in the stretch for
show. LAILA BELLA GIRL chased between foes in the three path but flattened. KARTER'S BABY BLUE had a slow start, trailed in the three path early and
never threatened. TREE C'S KAI tracked from the rail but was empty entering the lane.

Footnotes
KING SKULL set a pressured pace in the two path, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safe under a steady drive. AWESOME FOR SURE raced off the
pace in the two path, angled to the rail turning for home and rallied inside of the winner. WOKE UP QUICK pressed the winner in the three path, could not
keep pace with that foe in upper stretch but kept on well enough to hold the show. IMAPEPPA saved ground and failed to menace. STARSHIP MOCHA
chased the pace outside and steadily faded four wide. VIVA VICTORY played no factor while racing two wide. DRUM AND DRUMMER had only brief speed
three wide.

PAY ZONE set the pace in the two path, inched away around the turn, received a right handed cue passing the quarter, kicked on from the three path down
the lane, and held sway. CARAMEL CHIP raced off the pace from the four path going into the turn, fanned out to the seven path at the top of the stretch,
and rallied for place. X Y POINT stalked in the three path, was coaxed into the turn, floated out to the five path at the top of the lane, hung on his left lead,
but kept on for show. ABSOLUTE GRIT tracked inside, angled out to the six path under a ride turning into the stretch, but flattened. AVANT GLORY chased
in the two path, was coaxed along in the four path around the turn, swung from the seven path into the lane, but came up empty.

some ground on the pacesetter turning for home, slowly gained between foes in midstretch, took over near the sixteenth pole and held firm. MAGICAL
SONG lacked early speed, advanced four wide around the turn, rallied outside of the winner and just missed. LIONZA set the pace in the two path, yielded
near the sixteenth pole and fought on inside of the winner. SILVER MOONLIGHT prompted the pace in two path, angled in turning for home, continued on
the left lead and weakened. PRINCESS MISS EMIL was outrun inside. TEASING saved ground off the pace, hit the rail near the half-mile pole and never
threatened. NICOLE'S JOURNEY chased the pace inside and retreated through the lane. SECRET REVENGE hit the starting gate, chased the pace three

Footnotes
CONDORA set a clear pace in the two path while appearing to try to get out under a snug hold from the left rein and held clear under a drive. THE DOVE
RULES stalked the pace from the rail, tipped two wide near the eighth pole but could not gain on the winner in the final furlong. DEFLECTION trailed inside
early, swung four wide in upper stretch and rallied for the show. FAY'S RHONDA CARES bumped with BETSYLICIOUS just after the start, tracked the pace
three wide and lacked the needed rally. CONTESSA'S SONG chased the pace inside and faded in the stretch. BETSYLICIOUS bumped just after the start,
raced three wide and never threatened. TRUMPETS had only brief speed two wide.

AMERICAN OF COURSE laid up close in the five path, bid in the three path midway around the turn, took command while tipping out to the four path
turning into the lane, and drew clear. BEDROCK BIRDIE broke in and bumped an inner foe, chased in the four path, was roused from the two path into the
turn, and ran on up the rail in the stretch for place. PRETTYKEEN raced wellback in the three path, got briefly stymied passing the quarter, angled out to the
seven path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. PRETTY'N AWESOME broke out and bumped an outer foe, rated between foes in the four path,
was coaxed between foes in the three path midway around the turn, floated out to the five path at the top of the lane, but was one paced. SUMMER GOLD
tracked in the two path, was cued from the rail midway around the turn, but flattened in the four path down the lane. CLAY SOLDIER bumped between foes
and got pinched at the start, trailed along the rail and made no impact in the four path down the stretch. GITANA raced off the pace in the six path and never
threatened from the eight path down the lane. HOLY COFFEE set the pace in the three path, but lost the lead from the two path approaching the quarter,
and faded. JULEE'S LEGACY stalked in the six path but weakened in the stretch.
