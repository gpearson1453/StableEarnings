MARVELOUSMOONDANCE was well placed outside then flattened out in the stretch. SWIFT TAP set pressured pace inside then faltered in the stretch.
COALVILLE angled inside early, stopped on the final turn and lost contact with his field.

Footnotes
KINDRED HEARTS broke slowest, rated inside, angled out in the stretch, offered a strong late bid and collared the leaders late. LERETHA forced the pace
outside, was challenged from both sides in the lane, led and battled gamely. PEACH TEA urged to the front inside, dueled to midstretch and weakened
slightly. ECLAIR BLANC fanned four wide on the first turn, stalked three wide, loomed a threat in midstretch but flattened out. BOSSY KATE moved close
up outside in the opening quarter, faded and gave way in the stretch.
