battled head to head through the lane and dug in to edge the runner-up. PIPER'S CAUSEWAY set the pace while under pressure from both sides, dueled
inside SUNRISE JOURNEY while in the two path then came three wide into the stretch, fought through the lane and finished gamely in defeat. EL DIABLO
ROJO broke a step slow, chased four wide leaving the backstretch, tipped six wide into the lane, finished willingly from outside and gained third. SLEW'S
JOY pressed between early then chased the top trio leaving the backstretch, traveled two wide then angled out late on the bend, spun five wide into the
stretch, kept trying through the final furlong but got outkicked for third. PERFECT D pressed from inside to the turn, could not kick on with outer rivals at the
three-eighths pole, saved ground to the stretch, kept on to stay within striking distance with a furlong remaining but finished evenly late. VICENTE'S
SHADOW was off a bit slow to start, trailed up the backstretch, rounded the bend two wide then angled out approaching the stretch and failed to menace.

JOHNNY DRAMA vied three deep for command, took over around the turn, cleared midstretch and held safely in the end. EREBUS sat off the pace outside
a rival, went three wide into the turn, moved into the two path briefly then spun three wide into the lane, finished well and gained second but could not reach
the winner. MOBE TOWN tossed his head and broke a bit slow, recovered quickly and went up to fight for the lead inside a pair of rivals, fought along the
rail through the turn and into the lane, failed to keep up at the three-sixteenths pole and weakened in the late stages. CRYPTO CRAZE vied between foes
up the backstretch and around the turn, battled three wide into the lane, kept the pressure on JOHNNY DRAMA to midstretch, then weakened in the final
furlong. KIMMER settled off the top trio, saved ground to the stretch and lacked a rally. SMOKEM EZ was off slow to begin, trailed up the backstretch, came
four wide into the lane and could not make an impact.

KEEP YOUR COIL broke in and bumped hard with inner rival, chased off the rail then two wide into the turn, raced three wide turning for home, angled out
into the clear at the three-sixteenths pole, latched onto TAPIT DOUX past the eighth pole and drove clear. TAPIT DOUX tracked four wide into the turn,
moved into the three path briefly then tipped five wide leaving the bend, challenged in upper stretch, took over midstretch, lost command and yielded to
KEEP YOUR COIL in deep stretch and held second. WARREN'S SHOW BIZZ broke well, chased from inside then dropped back off the pace, angled off the
fence past the five-sixteenths pole, produced a mild rally and got up for the show honors. MISS JOANNIE bumped with outer rival in the beginning, stalked
three wide then came four wide into the stretch, reached the front in upper stretch, lost command midstretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. LA
CHIQUIS closest in pursuit in the early stages, hugged the rail to the stretch and weakened. LOVELY COLLEEN scrambled a bit in the hind-quarters leaving
the gate but recovered quickly and rushed up to clear from outside, showed the way two wide through the turn, was overtaken in upper stretch and gave
way. FAMILY TRIPS got pinballed and lost her path leaving the gate, traveled three then four wide around the bend and failed to menace. SHVERE
ARBETER got pinballed at the start, trailed two wide into the turn, eased out around the bend and came six wide into the stretch, altered in at the top of the
stretch and was never a factor. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE START AND RULED THAT SEVERAL RUNNERS BROKE
ERRATICALLY AND CAUSED THEIR OWN PROBLEMS AT THE START AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

MI CABO EXPRESS showed the way early under pressure, cleared outer rival, led along the rail then eased off the fence around the bend and came three
wide into the stretch, remained clear into the final furlong and remained strong to the wire. KISSMEYOUFOOL pressed the leader then chased from outside
two wide into the turn, took aim four wide into the stretch, followed within striking distance into the final furlong but could not summon the needed late kick.
DATSYUK stalked from inside, lugged out early on the turn and brushed rival, chased two wide at the five-sixteenths pole, bumped with inner rival leaving
the bend and kept on to hold third. MISCHIEVOUS DYLAN brushed leaving the gate, forwardly placed well off the rail, came six wide into the lane and
weakened. TAKAMAKAHARA brushed leaving the gate, chased between rivals and got crowded a bit near the half-mile pole, got brushed by DATSYUK
early on the bend, came five wide into the stretch and could not rally. DEVILNTHEBLUEGRAS broke a step slow, settled inside, angled four wide around
the bend and lacked a rally. MONGOLIAN FROST tracked off the inside, checked early on the turn, angled to the rail, bumped with DATSYUK approaching
the stretch and could not rally. PAISLEES PROMISE broke out and brushed, climbed and dropped back early, traveled wide around the bend and went five
to six wide into the lane, then failed to menace in the drive. UPLIFT chased widest early, came seven wide into the lane and tired. TOOTS TOOKAROOKIN
broke a bit slow and lost path at the start, unhurried in the early stages, also went five to six wide into the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
VILIFIED brushed the gate and bumped outer rival, vied three deep to the turn, dueled from outside past the three-eighths pole, cleared midstretch and held
well. IGNATOWSKI bumped leaving the gate, got put in tight between rivals early, chased two wide at the back into the turn, angled out and came four wide
into the lane, rallied and closed well to earn the place honors. LISA'S DOCTOR S stalked off the rail, angled in and saved ground around the bend, finished
determinedly in the drive and edged CHIRAG for third. CHIRAG broke awkwardly then went up to vie for the lead from inside, dueled inside VILIFIED past
the three-eighths pole, fought to midstretch and weakened in the final furlong. POWER TRIP tracked between into the turn, came six wide into the lane and
lacked a bid. INDIAN ARROW turned his head and broke slow, trailed early and moved inside, had a trio of rivals beat while saving ground on the turn and
could not threaten in the lane. CHURCHMEISTER vied between rivals to the three-eighths pole, chased the top pair to the stretch and faded out of
contention. NICE BOOTS chased between then dropped back, drifted out early on the turn, corrected and moved into the three path and could not make an
impact. NATURAL CAT stalked three deep leaving the backstretch, chased six wide into the drive and had little left when called upon. THERE WAS A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE START OF INDIAN ARROW AND AFTER A REVIEW RULED THAT HE CAUSED HER OWN PROBLEMS AT
THE START AND IS CONSIDERED A STARTER.

Footnotes
WHERE'S THE LOOT raced up close from outside, bid between foes on the turn, dueled outside DISOBEY in upper stretch, held a short lead over rivals on
both sides into the final furlong and held gamely over RHINO in deep stretch. RHINO tracked four deep into the turn, came five wide into the lane, bid
outside the top pair in midstretch and was denied by the winner. DISOBEY grabbed the early lead and showed the way while crossing over to the inside,
met a pair of bids around the turn, fought to the sixteenth pole and yielded late. SPIRITUAL ADVISOR chased from inside leaving the backstretch, angled
out around the bend and came six wide into the lane, summoned a mild rally and rounded out the superfecta. L'ENFANT DIT got crowded at the start,
chased three wide into the turn, moved out and came seven wide into the stretch and improved position. HAYWOOD bumped leaving the gate, raced near
the back then trailed off the rail into the turn, traveled three wide around the bend, found the rail in the stretch and passed tired rivals. PRINCE
PRANCEALOT brushed the gate then shifted in and bumped rival, chased three deep then three wide into the lane and lacked the needed response. SO I'M
TOLD broke a step slow, stalked from outside, bid three deep on the turn and weakened down the lane. IN VRONSKY STYLE stalked along the rail, two
wide into the stretch, moved out in the lane and flattened. WEGONAHAVAGOODTIME showed brief speed then chased up the backstretch, went two wide
into the turn, angled out to the four path around the bend and came up empty. BEER MONEY got bumped around leaving the gate, trailed early then raced
near the back on the inside into the turn, saved ground to the stretch and was not a factor.
