PANUCO went up to take control while pressured by EL ONDEADO, maintained command a bit off the rail through the turn, moved further off the fence in
the lane, continued to resist EL ONDEADO through the drive and held gamely to the line. EL ONDEADO sent to a forward position and pressed PANUCO
from outside, battled down the lane and could not summon the needed late kick to get by the winner. GIANT LUTHER chased the top pair into the turn, had
to wait on the inside behind the leader from the three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths marker, gained a clear path leaving the bend, cut the corner into the
lane, could not summon the needed response and was not persevered with late while retaining third. LAST VINTAGE chased the leaders outside GIANT
LUTHER, swung four wide into the lane, drifted inward under a drive and weakened. REASON TO BELIEVE off slow in the beginning, raced greenly up the
backstretch and trailed two wide into the turn, made progress while angling out on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to menace.

FUNKY GREY broke alertly, vied three deep briefly then chased O C RHAPSODY up the backstretch, headed that rival at the three-eighths pole, kicked
clear midway around the bend, drifted four wide into the lane, continued to show the way under right handed urging into the final furlong, lost the whip at the
sixteenth pole and held well. ILA VEIW TOO vied between briefly then chased up the backstretch, rounded the bend two then three wide, finished willingly
down the lane but had to settle for second best. LISA'S ANGEL raced in range from outside, took aim three, four, then five wide around the turn, chased
within striking distance into the final furlong but faltered in the late stages. RUNAWAY SALLY fractious in the gate, took hold early, chased two wide into the
turn, four wide leaving the bend and could not rally. O C RHAPSODY vied from inside briefly then cleared outer rivals, headed by the winner with three
furlongs remaining, relinquished the lead shortly after, chased two wide into the drive and faded. ZZYZX broke a step slow, chased under coaxing on the
inside, trailed into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
HAYLEY LEVADE broke a step slow, trailed up the backstretch, gained along the rail through the turn, rallied up the inside and drove past PUSHINESS in
the final fifty yards. PUSHINESS sped to the front, met the bid from CLASS CLOWN on the turn, held a short lead two wide into the stretch, put CLASS
CLOWN away past the eighth pole, then met the bid from HAYLEY LEVADE late and yielded grudgingly. DADS ESTRELLA raced up close from inside the
pacesetter, got put in a bit tight entering the turn, angled four wide around the bend, kept to task in the lane and got by CLASS CLOWN for the show honors.
CLASS CLOWN brushed the gate, stalked from outside, bid two then three wide around the bend, kept the pressure on to midstretch, then failed to kick on
with the leader past the eighth pole, weakened late and lost third. VRONSKY FEINT raced in range off the inside, entered the turn in the two path, steered
out and exited the bend in the five path, then weakened under a drive. KRISTI'S TIGER tracked widest early on, went three then four wide around the bend
and faded.

Footnotes
PROFESSORS' PRIDE rated two to three wide early, loomed three wide on the second bend, chased from outside through the lane, dug in late and got up
at the line. ISSA COURT pressed the pace from outside in the three path, took over up the backstretch, cleared into the far turn, showed the way two wide
into the lane, drifted out in midstretch, resisted when PROFESSORS' PRIDE latched on late and got nailed at the wire. GRAZIA broke out, stalked from
inside, moved off the fence on the backstretch, chased two wide on the far turn then cut the corner into the lane and churned on to edge CAROLE
LOMBARD for third. CAROLE LOMBARD broke a step slow, climbed a bit early off the inside, got boxed briefly three wide at three-eighths pole, angled out
into the lane, drifted back inward and lost third. TECUMSEH CAROLINE bobbled leaving the gate, was a bit rank prior to the first turn, chased on the inside
then two wide, rounded the far turn three then four wide, steered further out and weakened. FALABELLA tracked four wide early, remained wide and
entered the lane in the five path, then weakened in the lane. GILA showed the way in the two path while under pressure on the first turn, lost command at
the midway point, chased the new leader into the far turn, dropped back around that bend and faded out of contention.

Footnotes
DONITA ROSE showed speed between foes then got crowded early and had to give chase, saved ground through the turn, bid from inside entering the
stretch, lost touch with the leader shortly after, challenged again in deep stretch and drove past the runner-up. GRAINNE O'MALLEY bumped leaving the
gate, went to the front and set the pace up the backstretch, drifted out on the turn, spun four wide into the lane while meeting the challenge from DONITA
ROSE, kicked clear shortly after, tested again by DONITA ROSE in deep stretch and yielded late. BESSIE COLEMAN hesitated and came away slow,
trailed early then went between rivals leaving the backstretch, drifted out and forced HOT DANZING into BETTY PACK at the seven-sixteenths pole, came
five wide into the lane and gained third. BETTY PACK chased out wide early then four deep into the turn, got bumped and forced out at the
seven-sixteenths pole, chased five wide into the lane and churned on for a minor award. CONQUEST CELSIUS stumbled and brushed leaving the gate,
sent to a forward position, chased three then two wide on the turn and weakened in the lane. BETTING FEVER tracked four wide into the turn, moved into
the three path and came up empty when called upon. LOVELY BRIDE bumped with outer rival at the start, chased along the inside, dropped back and
trailed into the lane and failed to menace. HOT DANZING broke in and brushed, chased from off the pace, exited the backstretch three deep and between
rivals, got forced into outer rival and lost her rider early on the turn, jumped the outside rail and was transported off the track via equine ambulance.
FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED BESSIE COLEMAN FROM THIRD AND PLACED HER UNPLACED FOR DRIFTING OUT
AND FORCING HOT DANZING INTO BETTY PACK AT THE SEVEN-SIXTEENTHS POLE, CAUSING HOT DANZING TO UNSEAT HER RIDER.

Footnotes
T N T NOVA dueled from outside, drifted into the stretch while clearing inner rival and drew away under urging. COMANCHE GAL raced up close between
then chased the top pair up the backstretch, had to pause behind the leaders at the three-eighths pole, angled out and came five wide into the stretch, could
not get to the winner but bested the rest in the furlong grounds. MOOREA TIME trailed into the turn, came three wide into the lane, moved out in the drive
and gained the show honors. NOBLE RUNNER challenged for command from inside, fought through the turn while coming off the rail, entered the lane
three wide and weakened. ANZA SKY chased four wide into the turn, six wide into the lane and weakened. FIAMINA chased widest in the early going,
rounded the bend five, six, then seven wide and weakened down the lane. GARDEN PARTY broke a step slow, tracked under a hold early on, left the
backstretch in the three path, came out and traveled six wide into the lane and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
SUMMER SOLSTICE stalked off the rail, bid two wide at the seven-sixteenths pole, took over with three furlongs remaining, cleared inner rival then dueled
with outside foe into the lane, inched ahead in midstretch, had the rider lose his footing in deep stretch but was able to adjust his iron late and held well. R
AWESOME KID tracked four wide then between rivals around the clubhouse turn, bid three deep on the second bend, dueled outside SUMMER SOLSTICE
into and down the lane and failed to summon the needed late kick in deep stretch. CITADINO chased in the three path into the first turn before running on
heels briefly, moved into range in the middle stages, navigated the second bend two then three wide, chased after the top pair into the final furlong and
finished willingly to gain ground late. CLASSIC ALPHIE broke a step slow, unhurried in the beginning while moving to the inside, lagged behind up the
backstretch, angled out and came five wide into the lane, drifted in the final furlong and offered a mild rally to round out the superfecta. CROWN
PROSECUTOR chased two to three wide early, between foes in the middle stages, traveled along the rail then shifted to the two path on the second bend
and could not rally summon the needed rally. GAELIC NATION (IRE) chased from inside to the far turn, ridden along while tipped out, entered the lane three
wide and could not rally. THUNDER BALL chased five wide through the clubhouse turn, put in a mild bid four deep on the final turn but could not keep pace
with the top pair and chased four wide into the lane, then weakened in the drive. I WILL BE KING broke alertly, cleared the field and set the tone in the two
path, remained unchallenged up the backstretch, tested past the seven-sixteenths pole, relinquished the lead with three furlongs remaining, started to
weaken approaching the stretch, eased in the final furlong and walked off. UNCHARTED settled on the inside off the pace, moved out on the backstretch,
went four wide into the far turn, spun six wide into the lane, had little left for the drive, was eased and walked off. COME FLY AWAY broke out, chased four
then five wide on the clubhouse turn, rounded the second bend three, four, then five wide, eased in the final furlong and walked off.
