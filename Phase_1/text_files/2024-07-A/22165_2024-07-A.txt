angled out to come three-wide into the stretch and while unable to threaten the winner finished well for second in a steady effort. SUBITO SLEW was
unhurried early, came two-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. OUTOFQUEMADO was allowed to settle, moved up four-wide nearing the
quarter pole but lacked a rally. BATTLEOF TRAFALGAR prompted the early pace while two-wide and tired. GRAMMY WINNER was prominent for six
furlongs while three-wide and gave way.

Footnotes
LAPUSH was prominent from the start while racing three-wide, was carried out by RUBY RAY nearing the three-sixteenths pole, took a slight lead from that
one nearing the eighth pole and prevailed narrowly in a stiff drive. RUBY RAY vied with STAY SASSY for the early lead from along the inside, shook that
one off nearing the quarter pole then drifted out nearing the three-sixteenths pole, responded when headed nearing the eighth pole and held on gamely.
SILVERY ORB saved ground while being reserved off the early pace and finished in a mild rally. STAY SASSY vied for the lead with RUBY RAY to near the
quarter pole and weakened. BANGIE GO broke slowly and brushed the gate at the start to get away well behind her field then saved ground but was unable
to recover the lost ground. STEPUP was unhurried early, angled out to be four-wide the final quarter and failed to threaten. THE STEWARD CONDUCTED
AN INQUIRY INTO THE START OF BANGLE GO BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

COOL PAPA G was close-up early racing along the inside, angled out to be two-wide entering the stretch and finished well for second in a steady effort.
WELTON was forwardly placed early while racing three-wide, got shuffled back nearing the three-eighths pole, angled out to be five-wide entering the
stretch and finished in a mild rally. A VIEW FROM ABOVE was prominently placed while racing four-wide on the turn and lacked a rally. FANTASTIC DAY
dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch and gained his best stride too late. COMPANY'S DREAM prompted the pace for a half mile while
three-wide and weakened. POVERTY BAY settled in the middle of the field, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. PETER FLIES vied for the

Footnotes
HEAT SEEKING LETA was allowed to settle while racing three-wide, came five-wide into the stretch and closed strongly to be up in the final sixteenth.
CIELO DIAMANTE dueled with SQUARE FOOTAGE for the lead from along the inside, responded to pressure and held on gamely during the drive.
SQUARE FOOTAGE was bumped a the start by NEISSA then dueled with CIELO DIAMANTE into the stretch, could not stay with that one late and held on
fairly well for third. MERINO WOOL bobbled at the start then saved ground while being unhurried early and was making up some ground late. NOMI
LACKEE was forwardly placed while racing three-wide but lacked a rally. NEISSA was off a step slow then came out to bump SQUARE FOOTAGE, was
reserved off the pace while racing two-wide and failed to be a serious factor.
