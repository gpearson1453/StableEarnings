SIR BREGOVIC contended the pace inside of STONE CARVER, drew clear entering the stretch and was kept to task. SQUALOTORO trailed the field,
angled out sharply bumping into KAUAI DAN, and closed gamely. KAUAI DAN tracked the early pacesetters, lodged a bid entering the stretch then was
bumped, and flattened out. STONE CARVER pressed the early pace, was unable to move on with rival and yielded. STEWARDS INQUIRY AND JOCKEY
OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of KAUAI DAN against the rider of SQUALOTORO alleging interference in the stretch run was upheld. After
review of the film, SQUALOTORO was disqualified and placed third for interference to KAUAI DAN.

Footnotes
KEEPMEINPOWER allowed to settle early, was asked to quicken in the final turn, shifted four wide at the head of the stretch, and won going away.
WICKED WIZZY bumped leaving the gate, trailed the field, launched a rail bid entering the stretch and was along with time for place. CLASSY ROSE was
reserved off the dueling pacesetters, swung three to four wide at the head of the lane, and failed to threaten. GRACEFUL SPIRIT bumped leaving the gate,
saved ground from the second flight, and passed tiring rivals late. BURNING UP broke in causing interference with WICKED WIZZY and GRACEFUL
SPIRIT, dueled inside of SALTY CAT, continue to battle nearing the stretch, and gave way in the final sixteenth. SALTY CAT dueled outside of BURNING
UP, and stopped late stretch.

set the early pace while under a snug hold, was overtaken early stretch and was caught late. ARUNDEL CASTLE fanned three wide, stalked inside, and
