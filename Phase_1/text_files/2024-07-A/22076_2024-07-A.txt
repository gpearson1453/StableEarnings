VENETIAN DREAM vied for lead the lead along the inside into the stretch, shifted out to the five path, closed willingly between rivals two wide under right
handed urging and got up in the final strides. KLAATU chased the pace two then three wide, surged late in the six path and got up for second.
UNIDENTIFIED MAN sprinted to the lead three wide on the first turn, opened a daylight lead shortly after the opening quarter, set the balance of the pace,
drifted to the four wide in the stretch and was run down in the final strides. CANDY CRUSHEM unhurried early, found his best stride late five wide. GEH
SCHNELL failed to menace. OPEN OUT well placed, failed to respond. IT'S FATE stalked the early pace three wide and was after six furlongs. JACK'S
ADVANTAGE trailed.

Footnotes
LIAM'S LASS broke in front to set the pace into the clubhouse turn, was headed before a quarter, regained command along the rail at the half mile marker,
set the balance of the pace and prevailed under right handed urging. GRACIE DANCE slow early, closed rapidly along the rail through the far turn, shifted
out to the four path, shied from a left handed crop near the furlong marker and finished well clear for second. CRY IF I WANT TO unhurried early, finished
the best of the rest in the five path. SICILIAN STYLE TWO stalked the pace through the far turn then faded. NEW AGE BAD GIRL gained a narrow lead two
wide leaving the clubhouse turn, set the pace to the half mile marker then tired.
