moved up on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best. DELIRIO stalked the early leader and was a factor on the far turn
but from the three path at the top of the stretch leveled off. SILENT SUMMIT tracked the early leaders but chased on the far turn and failed to fire. J M R
TURF ALY was off slow, showed little and was no threat. QURBAAN'S KINGDOM was well back, showed nothing, outdistanced and walked off.

DANISH DYNAMITE was in touch, a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch drew clear. SOUL JOURNEY was off the pace, saved
ground on the turn and from the four path through the stretch was up for place. GOLDEN SPRING set a pressured pace and had a slim lead on the turn but
gave way at the top of the stretch. SHES HOT TO TROT was in range but trailed the field on the turn and closed willingly through the stretch. COINS
UNLIMITED was away alertly and dueled on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. SILENT PRINCESS was hustled early
and had a mild gain on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch faded.

roused on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was up for show. PALACE PRINCE was bumped at the start and had a mild gain on the
turn but finished evenly. STRONG ENDING was in mid pack and raced evenly on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch needed more.
MAXIMUS MOMENTUS stumbled at the start, trailed the field on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch had no impact. UNION COLONEL
broke inward, chased on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was empty. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON PALACE PRINCE

had the lead from the four path in upper stretch but failed to hold. PRINCESS ALESKA tracked the early leaders and raced evenly on the far turn but from
the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. EYE GOT IT GOOD was away alertly and forced the pace on the far turn but had nothing left.
DOODLE DANDY was well back and closed the gap on the far turn but was no real threat. IMPOSSIBLE BERTIE showed speed from the outside and had a
slim lead on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch gave way. SILENT BUT VIOLENT was in range but lost ground on the far turn and
