Footnotes
DRAGON'S BREW was allowed to settle early on, only having one foe beaten down the back straight, shifted out to the two path to split runners midpoint on
the far turn starting to get into gear, was full of run in the four path straightening out for the drive and got up in time with the late surge for the victory.
CHANCEL took command from the start, set fast fractions along the backside with mild pressure to his outside, put away the early pace foes by upper
stretch, was valiantly trying to fend off the hard charging winner late but could not hold at the wire. ROBITAILLE tracked between horses two wide on the
first bend, settled on the rail in mid-pack down the backstretch, started to uncork a run three wide at the top of the lane and closed in smartly to capture third
money at the finish line. RIVER OF BABYLON tracked on the rail in the beginning, lost some position down the backstretch to have a stalking role near the
rear, offered little run midway on the far turn and picked up tired rivals in the last sixteenth. ENDLESS SUNSET tracked three wide in the initial bend, edged
closer to the lead trio down the backside, was in the hunt in the two path with rivals on either side turning for home, lacked room in mid-stretch and finished
up evenly. SWATH prompted the pace three wide on the first turn, hounded the frontrunner under quick fractions down the back straight, was asked for
more right-handed in upper stretch, had little rally and yielded between foes at the eighth pole. SUNSPEAR pressed the pace between horses in the first
turn, was reined back to watch the front duo along the backside, moved in to pose a threat for a share in upper stretch, could not find more and folded at the
sixteenth pole. SUPER HEADLINE was unhurried on the fence to trail in the beginning, could not get interested far behind the pack down the backstretch
and could not get involved in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
HAAHEE was off a step slow to begin, travelled on the fence in mid-division, burst between horses two wide, commencing a run midway on the turn, moved
to the leader smartly four wide at the top of the stretch, battled down the lane, took over the lead at the seventy yards pole and was caught right at the wire
to share the win in a dead heat. MANETKA broke inwards on the start, settled alone in midfield down the backside, started to get into gear four wide going
around foes through the turn, angled five wide outside rivals for the drive to the line, was gaining to the wire and timed the surge perfectly at the finish line to
share the win with the stablemate. ROCK IT RED tracked the frontrunner two wide between horses down the back straight, chased the leaders around the
turn, dueled with rivals on both sides down the stretch, was no match late for the top two and settled for a good third in the end. ASHUKA was nestled on
the rail watching the pacesetter down the backside, kept pace with the leaders through the bend, was closing the gap on the fence down the lane, had to be
steadied in deep stretch and did re-rally to win the photo for the minors. STOLZER ONKEL seized control from the start, was unchallenged setting the pace
around the turn, began to get leg weary clinging up front on the fence in mid-stretch and wilted at the sixteenth pole. EAT FOOD EVERYDAY could see the
field while four deep outside horses at the half mile marker, offered a mild run four wide outside foes throughout the turn, angled in the five path turning for
home and finished with intent down the lane. SAILINGTHEISLANDS trailed the field after a poor start, was hard ridden inside a rival three furlongs out, but
could not make any headway around the bend and could not be a factor in the stretch running. CHIEF LIONHART stalked near the rear inside in the early
going, made no progress on the rail through the turn and failed to menace in the stretch drive. CANADIAN DADDY tracked three deep outside foes along
the backside, was scrubbed on but could not quicken with others at the three eighths marker and emptied out by upper stretch.

Footnotes
SUGAR IT'S ELI stalked on the rail in the beginning, galloped along under a good rhythm moving closer down the backside on the fence to track the
contesting duo at the half, waited to pounce behind the engaged leaders in the far turn, had a clear path on the fence at the top of the stretch and exploded
on by to with authority at the wire. BIG SHOOTER was void of early speed to trail in the early stages of the race, started to lengthen his stride passing foes
with five sixteenths from the wire, angled out for clear run in mid-stretch in the five path and closed belatedly to get up late to best the rest. RESTORING
ORDER stalked in the two path between runners in the beginning, made little movement along the backside, began to pass runners three wide midway on
the far turn, chased the lone gone winner with an eighth left to run but faded late to just miss holding for the place share. COPROLITE stalked three wide
outside rivals, settled on the rail near the rear at the half, made a smart move rallying on the fence through the final bend, angled out to the four path with
good momentum turning for home, could not sustain the rally and stalled at the furlong marker. DESROCHERS tracked outside in the early going, closed
the gap to press the issue outside down the backstretch, bid for the lead three wide in upper stretch, could not find more late and gave way at the sixteenth
pole. INDY COWBOY was situated on the rail in the third flight in the first bend, tracked between horses down the backstretch, was roused three furlongs
out, but was going in the wrong direction around the far turn and was one paced through the stretch. IMPERIAL STAR took this field into the first turn, set
the pace while hounded outside down the back straight, was collared on both sides in upper stretch and stopped on the fence at the sixteenth pole. GOLD
BONANZA travelled outside foes three wide on the first turn, was scrubbed on for more outside runners but could not maintain forward position at the half
and backed away outside rivals midway through the final bend.

Footnotes
DECIMATOR broke outwardly bumping a rival, settled mid-pack inside through the early going, advanced up the rail on the turn, angled five wide coming to
the top of the stretch, took aim while moving out a bit further, was put to stout urging by the eighth pole, struck the lead seventy yards out while surging past
under sustained encouragement. ECHO WITH LAUGHTER bumped the outer rival at the start, was forwardly positioned stalking just outside the leader,
moved to challenge three furlongs out, took a narrow lead by the five-sixteenths, moved clear by upper stretch now under urging, led till inside the final
sixteenth and was outfinished while best of the rest. STYLISH GENT soon led, set the pace near the inside, was overtaken by midway on the turn, fought on
still narrowly in back of the leader then still kept on once beaten to preserve show honors but needed more late. JAMIESTA settled off the pace outside,
went four then five wide on the the turn, came out seven deep in upper stretch, was gaining strongly but too late. HIGHLAND SOCIETY stalked from outside
with good position, raced three to five wide through the turn, went evenly and lacked the needed late kick. KID FORESTER tossed the head at the start,
settled in the back half racing between foes or outside a rival mostly two to three wide through the turn, improved position near but off the inside in the
stretch. TIMESKIP was bumped between foes at the start, unhurriedly raced toward the rear, fanned eight wide into upper stretch and showed late interest.
COLEYVILLE was bumped at the start, saved ground to no avail. NATIVE PRINCE was forwardly-placed tracking inside, raced off the rail through the turn
still in range, faltered and faded in the stretch. HELL BENT was off the pace three to four wide through the turn angling seven deep at the top of the stretch,
was never near enough to threaten. LENNY K bumped a rival at the start, raced at the back outside, was not a threat.

Footnotes
SASSY MELISSA sat alone under a snug hold in midfield in the early going, shifted outside going around horses three wide with five sixteenths from home,
loomed boldly in the four path at the top of the lane and wore down the leaders in deep stretch to get up for the well timed late rally. FOREST DRIFT tracked
the frontrunner in the beginning, closed in to press the pace outside three furlongs from the finish line, poked her head in front at the three sixteenths
marker, fought on stubbornly under left-handed encouragement between rivals in deep stretch but was out finished by the winner on the outside in the final
seventy yards. LOOPY seized control from the onset, set the pace with only mild pressure along the backside, dictated terms up front while shadowed on
the outside by a rival through the turn, was collared outside three sixteenths from home, never wavered fighting on to the wire, appeared to be inadvertently
struck by the outside foes riding crop in deep stretch and finished up a solid third in the end. FLOWERS 'N BERRIES settled on the outside in the two path
tracking the engaged duo on the turn, was just behind the leaders in the three path straightening out for home, could not find more in the lane, failed to fire
in the late stages and held on to be a fringe player in the end. ANAM CARA was ahead of one rival down the back straight, started to rally smartly at the five
sixteenths marker, angled to the four path behind horses in upper stretch, then shifted out five wide for a clear lane at the furlong pole and was gaining on
the leaders late but could not improve position at the finish line. PEACH COBBLER travelled on the rail watching the front pair throughout the turn, was
coaxed for more on the fence straightening out for home, had little to offer in upper stretch and tired on the rail at the furlong marker. HELLO FRIENDS
stalked near the rear on the rail, showed little interest on the fence through the turn and failed to get into contention driving down the lane. BRIDGE TO
NOWHERE was unhurried on the fence to trail the field, caught up to a challenger outside with five sixteenths to go but could not get involved running in the
stretch drive.STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING #5 LOOPY AND #6 FOREST DRIFT IN DEEP STRETCH RESULTED IN #6 FOREST DRIFT BEING

DADDY SEND MONEY was bumped at the break, moved forward between foes to take the lead by the seven-sixteenths, drifted in while still in command in
the stretch and held a rival at bay under steady handling. LUMBERYARD was bumped outwardly at the start while then veering into outside foes, moved
forward between runners on the turn splitting rivals past the five-sixteenths and drawing up alongside the leader past the quarter pole, was within range but
could not get past while secure in second. YODDHA was prominent in the very early stages then relegated back to mid-pack, switched out off the inside
racing three wide on the turn and into the stretch, kept on late to get show honors. UNSTABLE STORM was outsprinted early and taken back to last as
rivals moved nearer inside, switched out off the rail, waited in behind foes near the quarter pole, moved back to the rail coming into upper stretch and now
within range, could not kick on and was outfinished for third. GLORIOUS REVENGE settled off the pace, travelled three wide on the turn, came out six wide
in the stretch, passed tired rivals. UNCLE'S THE BANKER stalked from outside four to five wide, weakened. FOREST WOODSMAN was bumped at the
start, chased four to six wide throughout, was never a threat. PROFESORRIDESAGAIN broke outwardly bumping a rival, thereupon quickly moved forward
between foes to press from inside, continued to chase inside while losing ground after bumping the rail nearing the three-eighths, faded thereafter.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

SUNRISE DRIVE settled in mid-division in the two path between rivals in the early stages, began to pick up horses three wide outside at the quarter pole,
angled out to be a menacing presence in the six path for the drive to the wire, was on the wrong lead under left handed encouragement to the finish line but
it didn't matter in the end as he won going away when crossing the finish. BACHELOR PAD was fanned out five wide tracking the frontrunner into the first
turn, watched the leader three wide on the outside down the back straight, closed in when nudged midway on the far turn, bid for the lead in the four path in
upper stretch, was no match for the winner at the eighth pole but did show some grit to save the place prize in a multi-horse finish for second. NONNO'S
LITTLE BOY settled near the back of the pack on the rail, continued to gather himself at the rear down the backstretch, closed the gap inside by the quarter
pole, shifted outside for clear run with a sixteenth remaining and rallied late to be third in a blanket finish for the minor placings. INFAMOUS COVERT was
checked on the rail at the seven eighths marker, travelled inside in mid-pack down the backstretch, inched closer on the fence through the far turn to be in
range behind the leaders at the top of the lane, shifted to the rail with a furlong to go but needed more late to threaten at the finish. ARGENTIUM trailed the
field in the first turn, continued to see the pack along the backside, saved ground while still in last around the final bend, burst between foes in the two path
at the furlong pole, shifted soon afterwards to the outside off a tiring rival with a sixteenth left to go and closed quick late but was on the losing end of a four
way photo for the place share. FAST BOAT TO SKYE was tucked in on the rail behind the pacesetter, rated kindly in the third flight on the fence down the
backside, was on hold on the rail into the far turn, shifted out to the two path to edge closer with five sixteenths to run, angled out to be five wide between
foes for the drive, lost his path at the eighth pole and could not recover while on the wrong lead to the finish line. EMBRACE MY UNCLE settled near the
rear between horses in the first turn, made no progression along the back straight, shifted to be four wide behind the leaders at the top of the stretch and
was one paced to the wire. PEJA DU tracked just on the outside of the pacesetter in the first bend, took over the lead down the backside, opened up mildly
three eighths out, was engulfed by rivals at the furlong marker and wilted in deep stretch. C C'S KINGDOM stalked three deep outside horses in the early
stages, was roused four wide three eighths out, making a mild move around foes was floated out to the six path for the stretch drive and emptied out by the
furlong pole. SOCIETY JOE cleared from the outside to lead on the rail in the first turn, was then relegated to press the issue inside down the back straight,
came under a ride midway on the final turn, but was losing ground to the leaders and folded on the fence at the furlong marker. MANNIX (IRE) pulled the
rider under strong restraint to be in the quartet up front in the first turn, was hard held but still headstrong behind the lead trio along the backstretch, was
roused to go on three furlongs out, could not keep up with the leaders on the turn, angled outside in the five path turning for home and retreated in upper
stretch.

Footnotes
JAGGERSGOTAGUN battled inside for the lead in the beginning, pulled away for to be clear up front at the half, was headed outside in upper stretch, was
set down when urged left handed three sixteenths out, found another gear and repelled the challenger by the sixteenth pole. FRACEN MACHO tracked
between in the third flight inside at the half, darted through horses making a strong move five sixteenths from the line, bid for the lead outside, four wide in
upper stretch, drifted inwards under right handed encouragement three sixteenths out, could not threaten the winner who had more left in deep stretch but
did finish up to best the rest at the wire. DIOMEDES broke out on the start, was nestled on the fence just a couple lengths behind the leader down the
backside, kept pace with the frontrunner while waiting to move on the rail through the turn, angled outside to the four path with three sixteenths remaining
and finished up willingly to close in, capturing third money late. QUIET KNIGHT dueled outside in the early going, tracked the leader by the half, chased the
pacesetter on the turn, bid between rivals in the three path at the top of the lane, was soundly bumped outside with three sixteenths to run, lost momentum,
could not recover to pose a threat to the leaders late but did stay on stubbornly for a minor share in the end. HELLO LADIES settled near the rear inside,
took the shortest way around making little headway through the turn, angled to the three path for the drive and finished up mildly running on end late.
FOCUSYN travelled in midfield four deep along the backside, made little impression three wide around the bend, angled out the six path turning for home
and finished up evenly to the wire. CLIVE CROSS stalked close to the back of the pack outside foes, could see the field with five sixteenths left to run, had
weave through traffic inside down the stretch when losing his path and did finish up with purpose in deep stretch. FAST FRIENDS tracked in the third flight
between horses with five furlongs to run, was shuffled back some by the half, settled in behind the lead trio straightening out for the drive in the four path for
a chance for a piece of the prize but failed to offer a finishing kick in the stretch. SIR TIBBS hesitated on the break, then was checked soon afterwards, to
trail down the backside, finally caught up to rivals to actually pass some angling out in the seven path turning for home, had nothing left to offer by the eighth
pole and could no factor at the finish line. LEGS LIKE GIZMO was forced out on the break, became rank behind runners down the backstretch, was on
heels coming up to rivals at the five eighths marker, settled into stride finally on the fence through the turn, shifted out to the two path at the top of the lane,
went back to the rail in upper stretch and retreated on the fence through the lane. AURELIAN FLAME tracked three deep outside challengers early, settled
on the outside in the third flight by the half mile marker, was in range in the five path for a share of the prize at the top of the stretch, could not go on to the
wire and flattened out at the furlong pole. STEWARDS INQUIRY AS WELL AS TRAINERS CLAIM OF FOUL, PLUS A RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #9 QUIET
