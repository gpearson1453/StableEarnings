in the three path, bid at the half-mile pole but couldn't hold off the winner. STEP ON IT raced in the four path, bid on the far turn but couldn't close late. ON
PALM SUNDAY was unrushed inside, bid in the three path at the quarter pole and faltered. FIERCE ASSAULT was unrushed early, bid in the two path in
early stretch and was steadied at the eighth pole. GROOM LAKE raced well back, bid late in the two path and was checked late in tight quarters. BROKEN

the stretch. CAPTAIN PARTY stalked the early pace in the four path before fading. FEAR AND LOATHING was clear early and gave way on the far turn.
