Footnotes
DOUBLE BARREL pressed the pace outside of the leader, bid in early stretch and was clear under steady urging. ANAMNESTIC stalked the pace in the
two path, bid at the three-eighths pole, lacked running room in early stretch, moved to the three path late and bid belatedly. JEOPARDY THEORY saved
ground, angled to the five path at the three-sixteenths pole, rallied but couldn't close late. GAMER led inside but couldn't last in the stretch to finish on even
terms with MOMS MOON who raced in the three path, bid at the five-sixteenths pole and then faded in the stretch. HOBNOBIN GENERAL and GO BALI
GO raced evenly. BEYOND BEST was bumped and impeded at the start. NOW THAT ICAN ROCK saved ground, bid in the four path at the three-eighths
pole and faltered.
