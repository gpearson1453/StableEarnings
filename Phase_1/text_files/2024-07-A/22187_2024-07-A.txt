start, rushed up inside to contest the pace, dueled through the stretch but couldn't last in the drive. WEGOTJACKSBACK bumped with a rival at the start,
raced well back, then rallied belatedly in the three path. SPLENDID DRAMA saved ground to no avail. COMMANDER'S COIN bumped with a foe at the

Footnotes
HARD RYE GUY was unrushed early in the four path, rallied at the three-eighths pole, dueled in the stretch, came in late to bother a rival and prevailed
under steady urging. MY BARILEY stalked the pace inside, shifted to the three path at the eighth pole and closed outside of the kerfuffle. BRIT'S WIT
stumbled at the start, dueled inside and was checked in the late going. LUCK OF THE DRAW dueled outside and faded in the stretch. CHEESESTEAK was
bumped hard at the start, was unrushed early, bid at the quarter pole, then faltered in the stretch. FLAGS UP and EPIMYTHIUM stalked the pace outside of
the leaders before giving way on the far turn. GO NUTS was through early. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF BRIT'S WIT THE
STEWARDS DISQUALIFED HARD RYE GUY AND PLACED HIM THIRD.
