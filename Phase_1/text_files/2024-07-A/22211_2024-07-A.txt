Footnotes
BIG SCULLY raced off the early pace on the inside then was taken back to shift out to go three wide around the turn and cruised past the leader for the win.
ADIOS CARLOS sprinted to a clear lead from between horses but was caught at the eighth pole and stayed on to be second best. HEZA PRIORITY rushed
up from three wide to be in contention through the turn but was empty in the stretch and was able to save the show. CUSTOM BLUE GRASS vied for the
lead from two wide early then fell back before the turn and was not a factor. HAIL STATE trailed and was never a threat.

final turn, surrendered narrow brief lead but came again and drew off in the stretch. AWE SHACKLE stalked the pace from three wide through the final turn,
passed tired on in the stretch but was no match for the winner. COMPUTATION chased the leaders from two wide to the top of the stretch then moved out
to four wide and passed tired one to be up for the show. WINDCRACKER went to the front for the early lead to the first turn then dueled to midway through
the final turn where he took a brief lead but tired late. PRAIRIE DOLLAR trailed the field and was outrun.

Footnotes
EASY BIG BOY roused to the front to set the pace from a clear lead throughout and was kept to task in the stretch to hold on for the win. LITTLE ROCKY
tracked the leaders down the backstretch then move up on the final turn and made a late inside run in the stretch but was not enough. CINCO RICHIE
prompted the pace from two wide through the final turn but couldn't collar the leader and was a game third. PREFERITO DA BARBI stalked the pace from
three wide through the final turn but didn't make a bid and finished evenly. LITTLE FRAPPUCINO raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then
moved between horses near the three furlong marker but lacked the late response. AROLLERCOASTERRIDE raced near the back around the first turn then
made a mild bid into the final turn but was not a factor. VETERAN'S HOLIDAY was allowed to settle and passed tiring rivals. LIVINGSTON was unhurried
around the first turn then moved up from three wide down the backstretch but failed to sustain the bid. ALL TOGETHER raced in the middle of the pace
around the first turn then retreated and was not a threat.

EYE DEE KAY raced near the back early then moved up from four wide near the half mile marker, kept going to circle the field and drive past the leader in
upper stretch and cleared late. DRIED PEPPER had a slow start and trailed early then moved up between horses near the five sixteenths pole, tipped out to
four wide in upper stretch and was gaining but couldn't catch the leaders and proved second best. WISE ANCHOR sprinted to a clear lead from three wide
on the backstretch then tucked in around the turn but was caught at the three sixteenths pole and weakened. POMEROY HAZE vied for the lead from the
inside then was shuffled back near the half mile marker to trail around the turn but made a late bid between horses in the final furlong to improve position.
ZONG TOUGH prompted the early pace from two wide to the turn and faded. MIRI A COINCIDENCE chased the leaders from three wide and moved to
contention on the turn but tired in the stretch. PUDDING raced in the middle of the pack and gave way.

BEN DREAMING followed the leaded while settling off the pace on the inside gained ground around the turn and slipped through at the top of the stretch to
draw clear. GOTTA KEEP HIM tracked the leaders from the inside then moved up from two wide at the three furlong marker but flattened out and was
second best. CARTHAGE CAJUN was allowed to settle around the first turn then steadily advanced down the backstretch but flattened out into the stretch
and passed tired ones. SILVER TONE was unhurried through the final turn then gave a late kick to improve position. KING ARTHUR RIDGE raced in the
middle of the pack while saving ground to no avail. BRAZIL NUT raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then dropped back and was not a
threat. MAX IS G MONEY sprinted to a clear lead but was tiring and caught in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ART QUEEN pressed the pace from two wide around the first turn then moved up to take the lead before the half mile marker, was challenged near the
quarter pole but kept on to draw clear. TEXAS TWINKIES raced in the middle of the pace through the final turn then moved out to four wide in upper stretch
for a late rally but was not enough. SWIZZLECITY raced off the pace to the final turn then moved up to engage the leader near the quarter pole but was
outfinished by the late closing rival. I DONT KNOW EITHER went to the early lead from the inside to midway down the backstretch then fell back on the final
turn and finished evenly. WILLAMINA went five wide into the first turn then stalked the pace from three wide to mid stretch but lacked the late response
needed. DEROUTANTE was allowed to settle but was never a factor. BLESS D'SOUTH was unhurried through the first turn them moved between horses at
the six furlong marker and dropped back. SAVANNAH'S HERE lunged at the start then trailed the field through the first turn, moved up from three wide on
the backstretch but tired.
