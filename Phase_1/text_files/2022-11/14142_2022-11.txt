Footnotes
PROSPECT OF RAIN broke alertly and showed early speed to set the pace, set moderate fractions while well handled through the turn, drew clear into
upper stretch, kept to task in the final sixteenth and proved best. SUN AND SURF was away slowly, lacked speed to the turn while not far back, advanced
two wide on the bend, swung four wide for the drive, closed well inside of the furlong marker, could not reel in the winner in the final stages and was second
best. EFFECTIVE GIG was away slowly, rushed up heading to the turn to stalk the pace, saved ground to the top of the lane, was outkicked in the drive and
was clear for third in the end. PASSION OF JOE'S stalked the early pace, came three wide into the drive, lost position nearing the furlong grounds and
weakened. SMOKEM O'NEIL stalked the moderate early pace, dropped back on the turn and did not threaten in the late going. WOLF'S LIFE chased the
pace to the turn, lost position while outside of rivals nearing the quarter marker and was not a factor in the stretch.

Footnotes
HONEYMOONZ OVER broke in good order, showed early speed to dictate terms to the turn, came two wide into the turn then led the way along the rail to
the top of the lane, drew clear to mid-stretch, came under heavy pressure from the runner-up in deep stretch and determinedly held on in the final strides to
prevail. MURPHYS TIGER bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, settled off of the early quick pace, advanced while two then three wide on the turn,
closed well inside of the furlong marker, came within aim in deep stretch, could not get by the determined winner in the final strides and was denied for the
win, while besting the rest. I'M CORFU tracked the early speed, came three wide into the turn then pressed from the two path nearing the quarter marker,
lost ground in upper stretch, made a mild late re-rally and was outkicked in the final stages, while holding safely for third. LORD BRANCUSI was away from
the gate a step slowly, settled off of the early pace while not far back, came three then four wide on the turn, ran on the left lead in the drive and did not
produce a late rally. DARNQUICK tracked the quick pace to the turn, slipped to the inside nearing the three-furlong marker, steadied while in tight quarters
midway through the bend, dropped back heading into the drive and weakened late.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT METAL showed early speed and was forwardly placed in the early stages, attended to the decent fractions through the backstretch run, lost
ground nearing the quarter marker and into upper stretch, re-rallied inside of the furlong marker, responded to steady urging in the final sixteenth and made
a determined late push to prevail. YOU KIDDING ME was allowed to settle, raced just off of the rail through the backstretch run, angled out four wide in
upper stretch, closed fast in the final sixteenth, was outkicked by the winner in the final strides and secured second in the last jump. ZIPPY BABY settled
while well positioned in the early stages, raced two wide into the backstretch run, mounted a four wide rally nearing the quarter marker, loomed in upper
stretch, was outclosed in the final sixteenth and was just edged for place while holding for show. JOHNNY DAR broke alertly and established the early
advantage, was well handled through decent early fractions, extended the lead nearing the top of the lane and drew clear to mid-stretch, came under heavy
pressure in deep stretch and was outfinished, while just being edged for the minor awards. BIG SPIN was unhurried, steadied in tight quarters entering the
second turn, swung three wide for the drive, did not impact the leaders in the final stages but showed good late interest. MR. MASON stumbled at the start
and was away a step slowly, was allowed to settle, raced three then four wide along the far turn and did not mount a late rally. THATSABADBOY stalked the
early pace from an inside position, came in tight midway through the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way. BARBARIAN broke in at the
start, was forwardly placed while three wide into the first turn, stalked the decent pace through the backstretch run, advanced three wide on the far turn,
dropped back in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
POUR ON THE COLE was well placed in the early stages, saved ground into the backstretch run then was steered two wide into the second turn, mounted
a four wide rally in upper stretch, confronted THEYREMINISCEOVERU inside of the furlong marker, battled against that game foe and wore that one down
in deep stretch to prevail. THEYREMINISCEOVERU stalked the early pace while three wide, advanced on the second turn, took command in upper stretch
and took a narrow lead to the furlong grounds, met the late bid of POUR ON THE COLE, was gamely bested in the final stages and was second best.
ENGRAM was allowed to settle, came four wide into the backstretch run, slipped to the two path approaching the top of the stretch, advanced nearing
mid-stretch, finished well and was up for third in the final strides. DI LAURIAN was hustled to the early lead, set a contested early pace, ceded the lead
along the backstretch run and tracked WILL IS CHILL to the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch, came in tight nearing the furlong grounds and lacked
a late response. UNUSUAL CODE settled three wide in the early stages, advanced while three then four wide approaching the drive and finished evenly in
the stretch. ORCZY (IRE) was unhurried, saved ground to the top of the lane and made a mild late rally while not threatening. WILL IS CHILL showed early
speed and was forwardly placed along the first turn, made a middle move and assumed command nearing the half-mile marker, extended the lead to the
quarter pole, was caught in upper stretch and faded in the final furlong. PERSEVERANCE raced in the second flight in the early stages, came four wide into
the backstretch run, lost ground nearing the top of the lane, dropped back in upper stretch and was not asked for run in the late stages.

WINDRIBBON rated off of the early pace while well positioned, saved ground to midway through the turn, came in tight at the five-sixteenths marker and
shifted out nearing the top of the lane, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed fast inside of the furlong marker, confronted the runner-up in deep stretch and
surged in the final strides to prevail. FOREIGN PROTOCOL tracked the early fractions from an inside position, advanced on the turn, tipped out in upper
stretch and continued that bid to mid-stretch, assumed command inside of the furlong marker, was all out while under heavy pressure from WINDRIBBON in
deep stretch and was tagged by the winner in the final strides, while besting the rest. GREAT STORY broke alertly and showed good early speed, disputed
the solid early pace to the quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch, could not hold off the oncoming top pair inside of the furlong marker and was
outfinished, while holding for show in the end. HORSE DOCTOR rated off of the early fractions, came two wide into the turn, advanced in upper stretch,
closed willingly in the final stages and challenged for show. MR. MISCHIEF settled four wide off of the early pace while not far back, swung six wide for the
drive, lost ground nearing mid-stretch, made a mild late bid but lacked the needed late response. HANDSOME GARY tracked the early pace, came two to
three wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive and did not offer a late response. DEFENSE WINS lacked early speed, raced three wide into
the turn, swung six wide into the drive and did not threaten. DIAMOND BLITZ showed early speed and disputed the quick pace to the turn, dueled through
solid fractions to the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the final stages.

MATT'S MONSTER was allowed to settle, advanced three wide on the turn, angled out nearing the furlong marker, closed with a rush in the late stages,
surged in the final yards and was up in the final strides to prevail. RACHEL'S COACH showed early speed, tracked the solid early fractions, raced three
wide along the turn, chased the pacesetter to mid-stretch, assumed command nearing the sixteenth-marker, raced on the left lead into deep stretch, was
tagged by MATT'S MONSTER in the final strides and held for second in the end. DOUBLE JAB forwardly placed early on, stalked the pace from a four wide
position on the turn, came five wide into the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed in the the final sixteenth, could not reel in the top pair and held for third.
CUT ACROSS SHORTY lacked early speed, raced along the inside to the quarter marker, swung six wide for the drive, advanced in mid-stretch, closed
willingly in the final sixteenth and just missed for show in the final strides. ENJOY THE MOMENT broke out at the start and was off slowly, chased the pace
to the turn, came two wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and offered a mild late rally. RUNNING ON FIRE was hustled to the early lead,
set a pressured pace to the turn, extended the lead nearing the quarter marker, was set down for the drive and held foes at bay to mid-stretch, could not
hold off oncoming foes in the late stages and weakened. AUTUMN WORK chased the early pace from the second flight, came two wide through the turn
while within aim, lost position in upper stretch and lacked a late rally. G'S LAST CHANCE lunged at the start and was away slowly, lagged in the early going,
raced two wide to the quarter marker, swung seven wide for the drive and improved position late while unable to threaten. SGT POWELL chased the early
pace, lost position while three wide on the turn, was steered seven wide for the drive and gave way. CALCULATED SPIN was crowded a bit in the early
stages by RUNNING ON FIRE, chased the early speed from the inside, advanced on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ARMOUR PLATE took back in the early stages to track the fast pace to the turn, gained ground on the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, made a
steady gain on HOLYJAZZ in upper stretch, assumed command leaving the furlong pole and kicked clear in the final stages. TIZ A THRILL chased the fast
early pace from the inside, gained ground leaving the turn, could not match strides with ARMOUR PLATE in deep stretch and was tagged on the line to
dead heat for place. TOM'S MOON chased from towards the rear in the early going, advanced along the inside on the turn, swung three wide for the drive
and ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed willingly in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to dead heat for place. HOLYJAZZ broke alertly, was sent to the
early lead and cleared the field in the opening stages, set fast fractions to the quarter marker, was set down for the drive and took a narrow lead to the
furlong marker, was overtaken by ARMOUR PLATE inside of the eighth pole and gave way late. GREGS CITY ZIP chased from the rear in the early going,
came two wide along the turn, advanced in upper stretch and mounted a mild late rally in the final furlong. WILD WAGER lacked early speed, settled along
the turn while saving ground, shifted out nearing mid-stretch and showed good late interest while unable to impact the leaders in the final stages.
ALPHABETICAL stalked the early pace, raced two wide to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and did not produce a late rally. LOVER BOY
TOM raced in the second flight in the early stages, came in tight and was shuffled back nearing the turn, raced three to four wide nearing the top of the lane,
ran evenly to the furlong marker, encountered traffic in mid-stretch and did not mount a late rally. OMAHA RUTSCH chased from midpack to the turn, came
two wide to the quarter marker, lost position in upper stretch and did not threaten. DRUMADOON chased the early pace from the second flight, dropped
back while four then five wide on the turn and weakened in the stretch. TRABIESO AVELITO was forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the quick
pace three wide on the turn, came four wide for the drive, lost ground nearing the furlong marker and tired. TOMMY SPECIAL hopped at the start and was
off slowly, lacked early speed, lost position on the turn and was not a late factor.

HEAVENLY PRINCE was close up to the pace in the early going, advanced three wide on the turn, took command in upper stretch and was set down for the
drive, raced on the left lead while kept to steady urging in deep stretch and held the runner-up at bay in the final stages. STAR RACER showed speed and
pressed the solid early pace to the turn, advanced while between runners nearing the quarter marker, lost position in mid-stretch, re-rallied in the late
stages, was not able to reel in the winner in the final strides and kept to task in the end to secure second. OUR BOLD PRINCE broke out at the start and
was shuffled back leaving the break, rushed up to stalk the pace to the turn, came in tight while along the rail nearing the quarter marker, maintained a rail
trip while running evenly to mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and held safely for show in the end. ARMA D'ORO stalked the pace from the
second flight, improved position two wide on the turn, came three wide into the stretch run and produced a mild late rally. CONUNDRUM chased the pace
from the rear, raced two wide to the quarter marker, swung six wide for the drive, was floated out in mid-stretch by AWESOME DUDE, offered a mild late bid
but did not threaten. AWESOME DUDE chased the solid early fractions from the inside, swung five wide for the drive, drifted out in deep stretch to float out
CONUNDRUM and did not factor in the late stages. TO SPEIGHT HER broke alertly, showed good early speed to set fast fractions to the turn, was
confronted by HEAVENLY PRINCE nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch, chased to the furlong grounds and faded late. BLAZING
JAMIE showed early speed while chasing the pace, was a bit hard to place heading to the turn, dropped back while three then four wide nearing the quarter
marker and tired in the drive.

but began to re-rally passing the three-furlong marker, needed some room turning for home, got clear run with a furlong to go and finished strongly to prevail
over a stubborn foe. IMPRESSIVE CURLS broke alertly and dueled with WAY TO HOT to his inside and a trio to his outside, always seemed comfortable
with the pace, emerged from the stretch with a slight lead, had plenty left for the stretch run, battled gamely to the wire and just missed. IDIOT'S GOLD
broke well and was pushed to contest the early pace, was asked to quicken with three furlongs to go, got to the flank of the leading pair at the top of the
stretch then lost some ground when he did not switch leads but ran on well when straightened out to hold the third spot. VINNIEBOB chased the
pace-setting quintet down the backstretch and through the turn, was boxed in turning for home, found a seam in mid-stretch and finished well but came up
short. BLAZEN GRAZEN outrun early, chased the leading pack from far behind, raced in the four-path through the turn, swung out about eight-wide for the
stretch run and was making up some ground in the end while never a serious threat. SIXTYFOUR G T O showed good speed from the gate but was caught
five-wide as part of the early pace, dropped back a bit on the turn while still wide, swung out another path and had clear run turning for home but was unable
to make an impact. EASTER TRIBUTE lacked any early speed, started a bid midway through the turn under strong handling, swung seven wide into the
stretch, raced greenly while behind a wall of horses, ran on a bit when straightened out and in the clear but was too late to make any impact. WAY TOO
HOT aggressively ridden to gain the early lead with a host of challengers to his outside, was head and head with IMPRESSIVE CURLS through the turn,
battled gamely but faded in the final furlong. FACETIOUS broke well but sat behind the pace duel, angled over towards the rail to save ground into the turn,
was held up a bit behind a wall of horses turning for home, never had clear run but still lost ground through the final furlong. MYSTIC TBILISI broke in tangle
and trailed throughout, was not persevered with and did not factor.
