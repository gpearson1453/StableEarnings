HE'S THE SOUPERWON away alertly set a pressured pace through the backside rebuffing a fresh challenge into upper stretch holding resolutely to outside
pressure late. YEUDIEL advanced into the far turn pressing the leader to the quarter pole being rebuffed in upper stretch staying after it late to no avail.
PERFETTO prompted the pace through the backside dropping off a bit on the far turn angling to mid track in upper stretch coming again late.
ONLYATTHESHOE gained on the backside then wavered on the far turn dropping from contention there. BOB'S CALLING was never involved. ARCHIE
chased to the half then flattened out on the far turn. HARD ASTRAY folded up abruptly.
