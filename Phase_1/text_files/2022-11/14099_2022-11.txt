Footnotes
PRACTICALLY THERE saved ground on the first turn, started a bid past the seven sixteenths pole and took the nod three wide midway on the far turn,
dueled clear inside the sixteenth pole and held on well. STOPWATCHSONNY stalked two deep, challenged leaving the three eighths pole and dueled at
even terms from that point, took a slim brief lead nearing the quarter, but was met midway on the far turn and relented the final sixteenth. CURLIN'S DOVE
tapered to the inside and rated a slim lead, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and dueled at even terms from that point, was met nearing
the quarter, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn then weakened approaching mid-stretch. SWEET ANNABELLA rounded the first
turn in the four path, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn but proved empty in the lane. HANNAHS RED RUBY
settled in the three path the first turn, raced outside into the backstretch and chased toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path
then weakened. BRANDYURAFINEGIRL settled off the rail then faded past the three eighths pole. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
CAIRO CALLING settled close inside, entered the turn at the rail and rallied to the front midway through the turn, drifted into the stretch but dug in under
steady handling to widen later yards. MATH MAN MARCO, reluctant to load, took a quick lead and angled to the inside to set the pace, was met while two
deep midway on the turn, forced out into the lane and had to settle for second best. STRONG FIBER chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn and ran
evenly in the lane. PYEONG CHANG exchanged contact with We Be Shackin leaving the gate then gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and showed
little more. MONEY MIKE chased outside, entered the turn in the five path, was carried out into the lane and passed rivals. BIG DADDY D R chased toward
the inside and raced off the rail on the turn. WE B SHACKIN exchanged contact with Pyeong Chang leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch,
rounded the turn about the four path then drifted into the lane and weakened. This race was hand timed.

pole then kept sharp through the lane. BABY BULLDOG stalked off the rail, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail,
flattened later yards but held on for second. CHROME HEIR raced boxed at the rail the first turn then rated close into the backstretch, picked up the chase
nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and finished evenly while gaining on the runner-up. DREAM OF GOLD leapt from the gate and
was bumped outward and into Northern Weigelia then settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the
three path of the far turn and ran evenly down the lane. SHE'S MYBUDDYBUDDY saved ground racing well back on the first turn, bid approaching the five
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and finished evenly to pass rivals. BLACKWATER FALLS raced off the rail on the first turn, eased out
with a bid from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little in the lane. ONLY GET'N BETTER saved ground on the first turn,
gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little in the lane. MONEYFORNOTHING veered out and made
contact with Dream Of Gold leaving the gate, raced in the three path the first turn and gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, but weakened at the
rail on the far turn. NORTHERN WEIGELIA was bumped leaving the gate and rounded the first turn four wide, picked up the chase from the seven

Footnotes
DIAL HER angled out to give chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the five path and dug in down the lane to get up the final strides.
IMINCHARGENOW dueled to the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, was met midway on the turn, recovered the edge into
the lane and raced clear past the eighth pole, dug in through the last furlong but was caught in the final strides. MIDSUMMER NIGHTS chased through the
backstretch, closed to a slim lead three wide midway on the turn but drifted into the lane and gave up the edge, then ran evenly down the lane. BUFFUM'S
BEAUTY chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn, eased outward into the stretch and flattened stride. NOBLE PRESENT contested the pace inside,
checked in tight at the rail past the quarter pole and again midway on the turn, then weakened. BIG EYE JOY gave only distant chase. KOKOLORES gave
chase and rounded the turn in the three and four paths. JASIRA gave chase from well back. AMERICAN LEGACY gave chase outside then flattened in the
six path of the turn.
