Footnotes
SALUTE NOW pressed the pace from the beginning, took command around the final turn, drove clear, drifted out coming out of the turn, lost the advantage,
but came back and proved the best. PRINCE PERFECTA vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, took the lead after SALUTE NOW drifted out
entering the home stretch, but couldn't hold him off for the win. IRON N STEEL showed early speed, raced close throughout and proved no match for the
top two. HEZA SEXY ZONG raced evenly near the back in the beginning, made a mild bid, but was no factor. CATINANDSCATIN raced within striking
distance, weakened, finished wide and was no threat late. LOVE OURS lacked early speed and was never a threat. CUSTOM DANCER always raced near
the back and showed little.

Footnotes
FIRED UP TIGER went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and was kept to the task. ANOTHER HOT MESS raced near the middle of the pack in the
beginning, made a steady gain, rallied late down the inside, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. XCARET raced within striking distance,
moved up around the final turn, lacked a late kick and proved no match for the top two. TWELVE STARS void of early speed, raced outside around the
second turn, made a mild bid, but was no factor. ABSOLUTELY pressed the early pace, faded and finished evenly near the back. MALIBU KENDALL
always raced near the back, came around the first turn on the outside and was never close. VIV VIV VIV showed early speed and dropped back. DIAMOND
INDY SKIES had an awkward start, was quickly pulled up and walked off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS CALLED INTO THE START OF THE RACE.
AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
MAZING MARK unhurried in the early going, moved up on the inside around the second turn, angled out down the stretch, rallied and finished strong.
TODDCHERO went to the front, drove clear, saved ground, but couldn't match strides with the winner late. MANGUM raced near the middle of the field,
came around the final turn on the outside, made a bid, racing four wide and finished willingly. PRINCELY reserved in the inside, racing behind the leaders,
weakened and lacked a late kick. RITHM NIC pressed the early pace, was forwardly placed until late, fading down the home stretch. MUSTAFA void of early
speed and was never close.

MAJESTIC WAYS vied for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, took command around the final turn, pulled away and won under steady
urging. SWEET LAURA unhurried in the early part, made a steady gain, raced outside around the final turn, made a bid, four wide and proved no match for
the winner. JACKIES IRISHDREAM challenged for the early lead, raced close throughout, but proved no match for the top two. UNBRIDLED TWISTER
dueled on the front end, saved ground around the second turn and weakened. SPEED QUEEN void of early speed, raced outside around the final turn,
made a wide gain, but was no factor. TEASIN' TESLA raced near the middle of the field, weakened and was no threat late. GIRLS COUNT always raced

placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. TAKENFORGRANTED unhurried in the beginning, made a steady gain, proved
no match for the top two, but was a clear third. HIGH VALUE TARGET raced in the middle of the field, put forth an even effort and lacked a late rally.
VENUS ISLAND got in tight quarters in the early part, racing in the rear, improved position, but was no factor. SPECTACULAR IZZY lacked early speed,
raced outside around the final turn, moved up, hung and was no threat. SOCIAL DATE raced within striking distance, came around the first turn on the
outside and faded. COLD AS YOU raced near the back and showed little. CHICKEN OR THE EGG always raced near the back and was outrun. ALWAYS

Footnotes
OAK HILL LG pressed the pace, had an outside trip, took command around the second turn, drove clear and won under steady urging.
JOHNNYSJOURNEY vied for the early lead, drove clear, saved ground around the final turn, proved no match for the winner late, but was best of others.
DEALMEINBUD raced in the middle of the pack, moved up and raced behind the leaders at the 3/4 pole and proved third best. GETCHA lacked early
speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. HIGH RIDGE challenged on the front end, faded and was no threat late. LEMON KICK raced in the back of
the pack, moved up, racing wide and was no factor. SOURNOIS raced within contention and faded. CONGA BOY pressed the early pace, came around the
final turn wide and made a steady retreat. CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST void of early speed and was never close. WAYPOINT always raced near the back and
showed little. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
