hustled to a clear lead down the backstretch then tired slightly in the final furlong. MIZZEN MAN settled off the pace, moved outside and continued well.
HEATED BATTLE dropped far behind then passed fading rivals. TEQUILA JR trailed early and was never in contention. WEST FORK flashed speed three
wide and stopped abruptly. POP POP SUSI raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and gave way readily.

closing gap. QUASAR bid wide on the turn with narrow lead then flattened out late. WHAT A BEAUT broke slowly, moved up inside and faltered. DON'T
TELL FRANKIE raced close up wide then began faltering on the turn. GAVICHI broke in a complete tangle and failed to menace. HEY IT'S TATI forced
