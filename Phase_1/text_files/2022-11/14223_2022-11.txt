Footnotes
APPRECIABLE was away in good order to duel for the lead with PIRATES CROSS while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew
off as a handy winner. RODEO ROSE pressed the pace of the winner while racing four-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best.
PIRATES CROSS was off a step slow, rushed to vie, disputed the pace with the winner and gave way after going a half. BACK TO BUSINESS raced
unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. LATER DAYS was forwardly placed from the inside, angled out nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and weakened. CHA settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. QUEENS RANSOM was void of
early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

SWAMP SOUFFLE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and quickly
drew clear. FAMILY BIZ showed no early foot, raced six-wide through the second turn and finished with good late energy. UNLEASH THE BEAST sprinted
clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace, drifted out nearing the quarter and gave way through the final furlong. THE BEAT settled
off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly in the drive. LOLLY EXPRESS was void of early speed, saved ground
through the second turn, reached a contending position into the lane but failed to gain in the drive. HYDROGEN showed brief speed and weakened. FIRE
WHEN READY chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters.

Footnotes
RED NOON RISING raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and was up in the closing yards. DAZZLING MIST
was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and rallied late. STRADARI settled off the
leaders early, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole, offered a bid with a sixteenth to run but could not hold the
closers off late. J T'S LA NENA pressed the pace while racing four-wide, was carried out nearing the quarter, stayed on well and finished willingly.
COLLECTING STARS lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, reached a contending position but failed to sustain her rally. BIG CYN showed
no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MISS AGGIE BLING disputed the pace from the inside and gave way through the final
furlong. RIVER JUMPER vied for the lead from between foes, drifted out nearing the quarter, steadied in mid-stretch and gave way. SECRETLY
PARANOIDE lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
STITZY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, checked and bumped with LIMONITE nearing the eighth pole, was quickly
straightened away and drew clear through the closing yards. TARTINI lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and rallied late. TRUTH
SEEKER was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with good energy. TIGER DAD chased
the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-eighths pole, opened a clear margin and gave way through the final
furlong. LIMONITE was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn, bumped with the winner in mid-stretch and gave way. CONVENTION
was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and failed to menace. CLAVICHORD was checked at the start, lacked early speed, raced
three-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. MY INDY lagged early, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.
COASTAL KID was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the second turn and weakened. PAPA'S GOLDEN BOY sprinted clear at once, saved
ground while setting the pace and weakened after going a half. THE RIDER OF LIMONITE LODGED AND OBJECTION AGAINST STITZY CONCERNING
THE BUMPIING IN MID-STRETCH AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
