bid but flattened out in late stretch. AFLEET SNIPER was unhurried early then rallied three wide in the stretch and was no threat in the end. ROCKTIZWAY
was unhurried early then failed to menace. MORO MERICA was inside then saved ground on the turn, made a mild rally while two wide and was no threat.
BURTNJOE chased the early pace while two wide, was used up then gave way. REMEMBER ME TONY was unhurried early and no threat. CALCULATING
