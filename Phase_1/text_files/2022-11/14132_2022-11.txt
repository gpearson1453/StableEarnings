Footnotes
RAYRAY away cleanly, bumped with inside rival exiting the chute, chased clear leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn,
launched rally in the four path, surged and won head bob at the wire. POTENTE ALBA stalked pace in between rivals on the backstretch, continued two
wide on the turn, began rally in the two path, split foes passing the sixteenth, surged and lost the head bob in a tough loss. CHIEF EAGLE EYE away well
and cleared rivals on the backstretch, continued clear on the turn and into the stretch, kept to task in the lane, held diminishing lead late and caught in final
strides. TOWERING CHANCE away cleanly, bumped with rival exiting the chute, chased clear leader along the inside, continued to save ground on the turn,
launched bid along the inside and was outfinished by outside rivals late. SURPRISE FASHION bit slow and bumped by inside rival at the start, settled off
the pace and off the rail on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn, and launched mild bid in the four path in the lane. COJO stalked pace along
the inside on the turn, continued to save ground on the turn and failed to have the needed response in the lane. ABOVE THE LAW broke out and bumped
rival at the start, stalked pace three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
LA CROIX chased leader along the inside on the backstretch, entered turn along the inside, inherited lead when leader blew the turn, kept to task in the lane
to win clear. MY SWEET MARY tracked leaders two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, kept on in the stretch to hold place. QUEEN
VERRAZANO bumped by inside rival at the start, tracked leaders three wide on the backstretch, kept on in the lane to be along for third. LADY MOHICAN
settled along the inside on the backstretch, continued off the pace on the turn and offered little in the lane. U S READY broke out and bumped rival at the
start, led comfortably two wide on the backstretch, continued to lead entering the turn, and began to have trouble cornering and blew the turn.
