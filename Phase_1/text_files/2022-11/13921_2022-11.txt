DARE TO BE WILD raced four wide nearing the seven eighths pole, rated off the top pair from the outside down the backstretch, raced four wide near the
three sixteenths pole and proved best under strong handling. GOLDBRIDGE stalked the pace, moved up two wide past the quarter pole, shifted out five
wide and finished gamely to the wire. IZEONDEC settled off the early pace, moved up from the inside around the far turn and made a good rail bid to finish
willingly to the wire. DRAG MALIBU showed good early foot to set the early pace from the inside and weakened through the stretch run. RYE RUNNER
dropped back early to race near the back of the pack early on, raced four deep through the upper stretch and lacked a bid. RED BIRD'S STORM pressed
the early leader from the outside and gave way. FORREST was unhurried early, raced three to four deep through the stretch run and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
GOLD N SILVER pressed the pace from the outside and drew off the in the drive to be well clear under a steady hand ride. DRAGONFLY JACK showed
good early foot to set the early pace but was no match for the winner in the drive. LIBERTY SPIRIT stalked the top pair, raced five wide into the upper
stretch and had not enough for the top pair. JOHN LOUIS' BEVO broke in at the start, bumped rival, raced near the back early on, was fanned seven wide
into the upper stretch and raced evenly late. MR. WULLY BULLY settled to race mid pack early, raced four wide near the quarter pole and raced evenly in
the drive. BOTANY stalked the pace from the inside and weakened. STROLL LIKN OUTLAW was bumped, squeezed at the break, raced off the pace and
never was a factor. HE'S GOT CHROME raced far back and never threatened.

Footnotes
WHISKEY NOT WINE was unhurried early on, moved up through the far turn, split rivals nearing the eighth pole and finished strongly to get up strong
handling while racing three to four wide. MOUNTAIN BREEZE raced off the early pace, moved up from the inside near the quarter pole, shifted out to race
from the outside and finished gamely to the wire. VIATOREM showed good early speed to set the early pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile.
SPERLE stalked the pace from the outside of foes, raced four wide through the upper stretch and kept on to the wire. RESOLVE NOW stalked the pace
while racing between rivals and raced evenly in the drive. MANOR BORN rated to race in hand from the inside and weakened. CARPE EROS prompt the
pace from the outside of foe and faded. HAPPY ROMANCE raced six wide near the seven eighths pole, was five wide near the three sixteenths pole and
lost ground to race far back. RARE STRIPE failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
THREE ON THE TREE stalked the pace down the backstretch, launched a bid midway around the far turn, dug in determinedly under pressure, took over
the lead near the sixteenth pole and held late under a driving finish. RUNNIN' BLOCK was unhurried in early stages, given cue two wide at the head of the
lane, quickly gained ground, finished willingly and failed to reach the winner in time. FROM PIT TO PALACE broke sharp and angled inside, set the pace
down the backstretch, held firm into the lane then got collared by the winner in late stages. FREE MAKER settled off the early pace, saved ground then
launched an inside bid leaving the far turn, continued a strong contender a furlong out then gave way. DOSE'S DREAM tracked the pace, hustled up two
wide heading into the lane then weakened in the final furlong. SWEET ALEX rated two wide just off the early pace, coaxed three wide into the lane and
failed to kick on. RED DRAW raced off the pace, saved ground and had no response when called upon. NIGHTWIND settled three to four wide, hustled
along around the turn and failed to rally. MY CALANTE raced off the pace, swung four wide into the lane and posed no threat. BAREFOOT SAMURAI raced
in the back, urged along the outside into the lane and failed to respond. PANDEMIC CAT raced up close through the backstretch then came up empty
around the far turn.
