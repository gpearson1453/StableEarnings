Footnotes
HPNOTIQ RHYTHM sprinted clear at once, raced four-wide while setting the pace and drew off through the lane as a handy winner. MONGOL ALTAI
showed no early speed, advanced five-wide through the second turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished with good energy to gain the
place. WARRIORS HERO settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached a striking position but failed to gain late. ADD ON
was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and gave way. RIVIERA CHAMP appeared hard to rate, chased the winner while
racing four-wide, angled in nearing the three-eighths marker and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
INSTIGATE was away in good order to duel for the early advantage from between foes, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter, drifted out with a furlong
to run and drew off when clear. BOURBON AND WATER was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, reached a striking position nearing the furlong
marker but failed to gain on the winner late. AMADMADWORLD chased the leaders while racing four-wide, dropped back through the turn and came back to
gain the show. YANKEE GO HOME was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and failed to gain late. BLUE
PARADISE disputed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. YOU'RE MY BOY KAT settled off the leaders early, moved
six-wide through the turn and weakened. SIERRA SNOW STORM showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

THE BLACK STRAT was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths marker and held off the
closing WESTPHAL to prevail. WESTPHAL settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, rallied late and just missed. GRAVES
MILL ROAD was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly in the drive. BRIDLEUPTOTHEBAR
disputed tghe pace with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. JOKER MATT chased the leaders while racing four-wide
and gradually weakened. MIDNIGHT MOJO checked at the start, was unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.
BODEMONSTER lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
CLEOPATRA'S STRIKE was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the lane and was up in the closing
yards. THIRTY SECONDS OUT pressed the pace of FULLBRIDLEPHANTOM while racing three-wide, moved up to take a brief lead with a furlong to run
but could not resist the winner late. FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way through the
final furlong. MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and finished evenly in the drive. HAPI HAPI was bumped at
the start, showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn and was not a factor. THICK HAZE was bumped at the start, chased the leaders
while racing four-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. CALIBOGEE was bumped at break, raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide
through the second turn and weakened.

TAKING CHARGE DESI was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished with good late energy. IMPECCABLE
TASTE was off a step slow, rushed to vie, pressed the pace of FLY ROBYN FLY while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. KEEPMEINPOWER
lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn, reached a contending position and failed to gain late. FLY ROBYN FLY was away in good order to
set a pressured pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. EASTER GRACE lagged early, raced four-wide through the second
turn and did not reach contention. TED'S CANDY GIRL raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the second turn and weakened.

MINISTER OF SOUL was away in good order to duel for the lead with DON JUAN KITTEN while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the
five-sixteenths pole and drew off as handy winner. JAZZ HANDS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, was no match
for the winner in the drive but clearly second best. BEDROCK showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with some late run.
THIEF IN THE NIGHT was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. PRINCE ALI showed no early speed, saved
ground through the turn and did not threaten. DON JUAN KITTEN disputed the pace with the winner from the inside, weakened after going a half, was
unsaddled on the back-stretch and was vanned off.

Footnotes
SECOND GRACE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run, edged away and held
MOONSHINE MOXY safe late. MOONSHINE MOXY settled off the leaders from between foes, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with good late
energy. SHOE GAME showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, lacked racing room nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished well
when clear. MADISON'S QUARTERS chased the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and finished willingy. TIZ TENACIOUS was void of early
speed, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished with some late run. MOUNTAIN PASS sprinted clear at once, raced off the
rail while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch and gave way late. MY EXPRESSION showed brief speed, raced five-wide through the
turn and weakened. MAYBEE A DIVA was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. SHELBY R. raced just off the
leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not
reach contention. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
