INSTANT CHAOS pressed the pace racing close up outside, bid entering the far turn, took over, drew clear and was kept to the task. SALTIN' THE RIM
raced three wide early, stalked three wide, chased three wide on the far turn, rallied and came up second best. MINE NOT MINE raced off the rail, off the
pace, moved up three wide on the far turn and rallied mildly for third. VICTORY IS OURS set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner, then chased
and weakened. LUDO tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and tired. LIBERTY RUNNER was outrun early and passed tired foes.
JERUSALEM GATES was off slowly, raced off the pace inside, then two wide and faded. CURLIN LANE raced three wide early, settled off the rail, off the
pace and did not factor.

dueling pacesetters, rallied to the front into the far turn, drifted out at the quarter pole, dueled gamely and just missed. SPARTAK trailed while unhurried
early then advanced outside to get up for the show. MARGIN OF AIR dueled while reserved inside, tired on the final turn, angled out at the five sixteenths
pole and lacked a further response. SOVEREIGN CHANGE earned a narrow lead outside, dueled to final turn and faded. FORMAL ORDER saved ground
within range briefly then gave way readily.
