Footnotes
LOAD ABROAD battled inside for the early lead down the backside, took control to open up while in hand racing on the turn, drew away when roused mid
stretch and won comfortably at the finish line. CARLA'S HONOR tracked three wide outside in the second flight at the half mile marker, rallied midpoint on
the turn splitting foes, loomed five wide for the stretch drive, bumped with inside challenger nearing the eighth pole and finished up to garner the place
share. MY GIRL HOOTER was unhurried in the early stages to trail the field, began to extend her stride three furlongs from the wire inside, contended four
wide turning for home, exchanged bumps with an outside rival in mid stretch and regrouped late to finish up determinedly to just miss getting the place
award. LETS RUN TWO stalked between runners in the two path down the backstretch, had to be taken a hold of while in tight between horses nearing the
half, was shuffled back to trail into the turn and rallied inside at the furlong marker to get a small share in the end. ROAD MAP broke sharp to be in front
leaving the chute, exited out of the early pace trio at the half mile pole, was roused four wide entering the stretch, shifted outwards to be six wide for the
drive and had no finish to give. SHISHKA battled for the lead early three wide outside, chased the winner throughout the turn, was urged for more run at the
top of the lane, had little response and gave way in the final sixteenth. STUNNING RIVERS travelled on the fence in the second flight in the beginning,
offered a mild run on the rail three eighths from home, continued to save ground at the top of the stretch, had no finish to give down the lane and retreated
at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
FOREST CHOICE was coaxed clear to set the pace racing off the rail, asked for more at the top of the stretch and responded by kicking clear of all
challengers. BAYSVILLE pursued the eventual winner from outside, went three to four wide on the turn, came wider into upper stretch, fought inside a foe to
secure the place while no real threat to the winner. MEETING AT MARTHAS was encouraged along outside racing mid-pack four to five wide on the turn,
came out further for the stretch run, ranged up alongside a rival but could not get past for the place. MISS SCHILLER lacked early speed, raced off the
inside through the turn, came into upper stretch five to six deep, kicked on to improve position getting up over a foe for the minor award. COSMIC SHOT
tracked in behind, came outside the leader three wide at the quarter, loomed a threat briefly but could not sustain the effort. INTO EMPIRES SONG chased
inside, ran on evenly and failed to rally. FREE CARRYCOMB chased from between runners two to three wide on the turn, weakened. DIXIEWISH raced
toward the back inside a rival but off the fence, moved out nine wide into upper stretch and had no rally. SPEED CHESS settled outside at the rear, was
bumped a few times near the three-eighths, swung ten wide into the stretch and asked for run but offered little in the way of response. SHES LOADED was
in a bit tight at the start, raced between foes at the back, bumped a rival and steadied entering the turn, was never a threat.

Footnotes
ROLLING HILLS broke sharp to dictate the pace at the half, continued to set the fractions leading on the turn, opened up at the three sixteenths marker and
had just enough left in the tank to hold safe for a narrow victory. GIVE ME MY MONEY tracked three wide running down the backstretch, rallied three wide
at the quarter pole, had his sights set on the winner turning for home and was gaining through the lane only to just miss in a close photo at the finish.
BARWICK chased the winner throughout in the early stages of the race, could not keep pace with the top two finishers at the top of the lane but still had
enough to comfortably hang on for the show award in the end. FRANKS RELOAD had a good rail position tracking the leaders into the turn, appeared to be
getting out three eighths from the finish, was in the hunt for a share of the prize at the top of the stretch but needed more to threaten the top three running to
the wire. GRACEFUL FIGHTER was void of early speed in the beginning, was ridden three furlongs from the finish and showed some late interest to pass
tiring runners racing to the wire. IT'S ME MARIO broke poorly to trail at the start, offered a mild run saving ground on the turn and could not recover enough
to be a factor in the stretch drive. JOE CHROME stalked in midfield between foes three wide at the half, was urged for more run midpoint on the turn, shifted
out to the five path for the drive and levelled off at the furlong marker. SANDY GRACE settled in mid pack four deep on the backside, trailed the field into the

Footnotes
CREEMORE moved forward inside heading up the backstretch to track in behind, came out nearing the quarter pole, took over three wide by the top of the
stretch, kicked clear under urging and was kept to the task. COURTINGCOURTNEY settled off the pace, went five then six wide on the turn, still had much
to do when altering out eight wide coming to the furlong marker, rallied strongly at that juncture but too late. ABSOLUTE JEWEL pursued from mid-pack
going four then five wide on the turn and asked for run by the five-sixteenths, came into upper stretch six wide and close to the leader, lost place in late
stretch. CRYSTAL CRESCENT was off the leaders but about mid-pack in the three path on the turn, came out turning for home, ran on evenly and switched
outside rivals inside the final sixteenth. BEN'S SUNNY ISLAND had the early lead but relinquished it while content to stalk, went three to four wide on the
turn and was in striking distance turning for home but flattened out. LOADED SECRET saved ground inside racing mid-pack, went evenly. CLIFF'S HEAD
chased from two to three wide through the turn, lacked the needed late kick. DELIGHTFUL DREAMER reared at the start, was ridden along early but
lacking speed, came out for the stretch run and passed rivals. CALL ME BROOKE was positioned off the pace, went five wide on the turn, was empty for the
drive. TENPENNY NAIL shifted in, raced near the inside, was not a threat. EXECUTIVE EFFECT moved forward inside under some urging to take the lead
outside the five-eighths, set the tempo to the top of the stretch, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
WAR'S END KISS settled in the third flight inside down the backstretch, waited for clear running room at the quarter pole, split foes at the top of the stretch
and found her best stride late to draw away in the late stages. TACHYON SPEED rallied from the back of the pack around horses midpoint on the turn,
found a seam turning for home in the four path and closed well to get up for place nearing the wire. SILENT TRIBUTE pressed the pace at the half mile
marker inside, took command around the turn to be in front, was collared nearing the sixteenth pole by the winner and lost place while tiring just before the
finish line. GREAT KATE travelled close to the back of the field three wide down the backside, rallied five wide two furlongs remaining, angled out widest in
the nine path at the top of the stretch and closed with energy to get up for a minor role. HOLIDAY WITH AMY hesitated at the break to be close to the back
of the pack in the early stages, was ridden inside three furlongs to the wire, angled out seven wide for the drive and closed between rivals the final eighth.
KNOTTY AND NICE broke slow at the start, settled near the rear down the backside, saved ground entering the turn, angled out at the quarter pole to be
seven wide for the stretch run and finished up with run to be involved for the smaller shares at the wire. LADY GABRIELLE had a good position on the turn
inside tracking the engaging frontrunners, was asked to go after the leaders racing on the fence at the top of the lane, could not keep pace and faded in the
final sixteenth. VERI GIZMO put in a solid run four wide around foes three furlongs to the wire, was in contention in the five path turning for home and
weakened at the furlong marker. TRICK AND TREAT stalked midfield between foes at the half, was steadied racing between runners nearing the three
furlong marker, was shuffled back to trail with a quarter remaining could not get involved in the stretch. HUMOR ME JIM broke sharp to lead in the
beginning, contested outside up front entering the turn, gave way between rivals five sixteenths to the finish and stopped at the top of the stretch. STRIKE
THE POSE tracked behind the engaging leaders three furlongs from home, loomed three wide to bid two furlongs to the finish, faded at the top of the stretch
and faltered in the final eighth. MISS BIKINI settled in mid pack three wide outside of rivals entering the turn, was coaxed five sixteenths from the line,
offered little response and could not make an impact racing eight wide down the lane.

Footnotes
EXECUTIVE SIGHT chased from outside a rival off the leading trio, moved out from three to five wide on the turn, took aim and struck the lead outside the
sixteenth pole and drew clear. BOUND LUCKY bumped a rival at the start, was forwardly-placed from between runners vying for the early lead, dropped
back a little bit into the turn, came again from between three deep to take the lead past the quarter pole, was clear in mid-stretch but outkicked. QIAN B C
was outpaced early racing near inside, swung seven wide, was gaining late but too late to get the place. CRAFTY CONQUEST was bumped sideways at
the start, raced at the back, swung seven wide, improved position. SHAKOO MAKOO broke very sharply with a one-length advantage strides out of the
gate, attended the pace from outside mostly four wide, was empty for the drive. LORD OF LEGENDS moved forward to vie for the lead inside, came up
empty. TALL WATER chased in behind mostly two to three wide and inside a foe, clipped heels at the top of the stretch, stumbled, lost the rider, walked off.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO BOTH THE START AND THE STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
ARTFUL BALLERINA hounded the early leader just outside down the backside, took control three furlongs from the finish, widened her lead turning for
home and drew off when roused in deep stretch for a convincing win. SUGAR IS GOLDEN was situated in the middle of the field three wide down the
backstretch, rallied between horses midpoint on the turn to be in the hunt at the top of the stretch and closed belatedly besting the rest at the finish line.
KNOW HOW (GB) lost ground while shuffled back entering the turn, rallied four wide in upper stretch, shifted inwards nearing the eighth pole and offered a
good run up the fence to capture the show nearing the wire. GREEN GABLES travelled midfield four wide in the beginning, was ridden to go on three wide
two furlongs from the finish, offered a mild bid at the top of the lane and stalled in deep stretch losing the show award just before the wire. REMEMBERING
RHODA trailed the field at the half mile marker, angled six wide for the drive to the line and could not make an impression through the lane passing only
tiring horses in the stretch. AMERICAN GAMBLE led the field running into the turn, was headed outside by the winner three furlongs to the line, gave way
on the fence at the top of the stretch and faltered the final eighth. CHARLOTTE'S SILVER settled near the rear stalking on the rail into the turn, was
steadied on the fence at the seven sixteenths marker, closed the gap to the field turning for home, was taken up nearing the furlong marker and could not
regroup to be a threat at the finish. BIG GINGER tracked just behind the contesting leaders into the turn, was ridden inside to keep pace at the quarter pole
and stopped on the rail in mid stretch. STEWARDS INQUIRY AND RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #1 CHARLOTTE'S SILVER AGAINST #3 KNOW HOW
