TUESDAY TOO dueled for the lead toward the seven sixteenths pole, contested the turn at the rail, drifted into the lane and was steadily handled to hold on
well. TAPTAP chased inside and raced close through the turn, drifted into the stretch and held on for second. FAR MORE chased through the backstretch,
entered the turn near the rail, angled out toward the head of the lane and finished well while gaining on the runner-up. LADY GANGSTER broke a step slow
then picked up the chase, raced near the rail on the turn, angled out from the mid point of the turn, entered the stretch about the six path and finished
evenly. KNOBIESMAGICSONDE chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path then flattened the final furlong. LITTLE O LITTLE E
chased outside, entered the turn in the five path, was carried to the seven path leaving the turn and had little left. LAURA'S GRAND had a brief early lead
then gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the turn and weakened in the lane.

pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and ran evenly in the lane. MASAI MAN settled off the rail early, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole,

SECRET CASTLE broke awkwardly and rated at even terms with Distorted Splendor while alternating the lead with that one, recovered the advantage
approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and dug in determinedly to hold off the stretch challenge of GRACE ELIZABETH, who
settled close off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced close at the rail on the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane and
finished well at the outside girth of the winner. FEEL THE LOVE saved ground on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the
far turn, eased outward through the upper stretch and finished evenly. OCEAN LILLY was jostled at the start and settled in the three path of the first turn,
gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and relented in the stretch duel for third. LADY MADISON rounded the first
turn in the three path and entered the backstretch outside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn and showed little
more. COACH RUBE broke out and made contact with Ocean Lilly then settled close in the three path the first turn, challenged from the seven sixteenths
pole and dueled close through the backstretch, but flattened in the three path of the far turn. HERETODAYGONMANANA raced off the pace in the four path
the first turn and showed little response. DISTORTED SPLENDOR broke in and made contact with Ocean Lilly then raced with the pace while alternating for
the lead with Secret Castle, gave chase from the three eighths pole but weakened into the far turn.

Footnotes
WOLF CREEK PASS set a pressured early pace outside, moved clear and angled to the inside nearing the quarter pole, widened at the rail on the turn and
dug in under steady stretch encouragement to hold on. LADY LICIOUS chased the early pace outside, ran in the three path of the turn and dug in down the
lane to take second the final strides. U S FUNDS chased down the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail, raced close through the stretch but was
nipped from second the final strides. CHARM WEAVER broke through prior the start, gave chase down the backstretch and raced off the rail on the turn,
drifted leaving the turn but dug in and finished well. NY BETH GETSITDONE chased, raced in the three path of the turn, eased out leaving the turn and
finished well. HURRICANE DIRECTOR chased toward the inside, ran at the rail on the turn then flattened the final sixteenths. WHYCANTTHISBELOVE
chased the early pace inside, angled to the seven path rounding the turn and finished well outside. COUNTRY MAGIC gave chase, rounded the turn about
the seven path and finished evenly widest. KYMMIES CHARDONNAY was hustled along with the early pace but dropped back leaving the five sixteenths
pole and weakened losing ground on the turn.
