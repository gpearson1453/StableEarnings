Footnotes
BUTWAITTHERE'SMORE broke out, unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a late rally, racing four wide and drove
clear. WAR ZONG went to the front, drove clear, saved ground, but proved no match late for the winner. MOONSHINE MAX vied for the early advantage,
forwardly placed throughout, but proved no match for the top two. SABERMAN raced in the middle of the field, put forth an even effort and lacked a late
rally. RUSSET MOON lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. UNCLE CHAN raced evenly near the back, finished wide and lacked a bid.
GENIUS was fractious in the gate, pressed the early pace and faded. PRAYFORTHEWIN was bumped at the start, raced within striking distance and
dropped back. DEE DIN always raced near the back, trailed late, was eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
CLEAR HUMOR raced within striking distance, saved ground around the second turn, angled out, rallied down the lane, drove clear and finished well.
ALIGNED INTEREST lacked early speed, racing wide around the first turn, moved up, made a bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second.
MIDNIGHT NIGHTMARE void of early speed, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a bid, proved no match for the top two, but got up for
show. RUBIGINOUS raced in the middle of the field, entered the final stretch wide, rallied and was outfinished for show. JUSTA SWINGING lacked early
speed, made a mild bid, but was no factor. MY BOY GUS broke a step slow, rushed up, challenged for the early advantage and faded. THE FEATURE vied
for the early lead, saved ground and retreated. ROCK ON COWBOY raced near the middle of the pack, dropped back and was outrun. FLASHBURN raced
within striking distance, behind the top two in the early going and dropped to the rear.

LITTLE STAR TARGET went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and won under steady urging. MAKE YOUR DESTINY pressed the pace, forwardly
placed throughout and followed the winner to the wire. INDEFENSIBLE TOWN raced within contention, was close throughout and proved no match for the
top two. ST PIERRE broke poorly, racing in the back early, improved position, but was no factor. CITY BOY EASTWOOD was bothered at the start, raced
within striking distance, came around the first turn wide and faded. FISHIN WITH PETE was fractious in the gates, broke in, showed brief speed and
dropped back. LIFEASWEKNOWIT was unruly in the gates, always raced near the back and showed little.

FINAL QUEST vied for the early lead, dueled throughout and drove clear before the wire. WON DAY challenged on the front end, saved ground around the
turn, dueled down the stretch, was outfinished for the win, but was a clear second. FOLLOW THE SAINT raced near the back in the beginning, made a late
gain, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. CRYPTO BRAVE pressed the pace, came around the turn seven wide, made a mild bid, but
was no factor. RUN NATALIE RUN void of early speed, showed late interest, but was no threat. ALEXAPLAYBORNTORUN was an early factor, weakened
and lacked a late kick. MISS PRIORITY challenged on the front end, came around the turn three wide and faded. SHEZA SALTY GAL showed brief speed
and made a steady retreat. DEAL ME A PENNY lacked early speed and was never a threat. APRIORITY GIRL always raced near the back and was outrun.

Footnotes
FISH N CHICK pressed the pace, took command around the turn, pulled away and was ridden out. TENSAS VIRGINIA raced within contention, moved up,
racing behind the leader, proved no match for FISH N CHICK, but was a clear second. BRINEE pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and proved
no match for the top two. CASH BIZNESS broke through the gates before the start, raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid, but was no factor.
KLEINMEISTER raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, came around the turn wide, showed late interest, but was no threat. MYSTERIOUS STAR
raced within striking distance, saved ground around the turn and faded. SHE WANTS HALF raced evenly near the back and lacked a bid. MISS
CHECKMARK void of early speed, came around the turn wide and showed little. ROUX BANDIT raced near the middle of the pack in the early going, faded
and was no threat late. ALYS EPISODE went to the front, drove clear and dropped to the rear.
