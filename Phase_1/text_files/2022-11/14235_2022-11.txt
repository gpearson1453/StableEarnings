turn, swung four wide in the lane and surged late to get up for second. VERMEER vied for lead two wide on the backstretch, continued to contest pace on
the turn, entered lane in contention and stayed on gamely to just get nailed for second at the wire. TERRIBLE TED vied inside of rival for lead on the
backstretch, continued pressing pace along the inside on the turn, entered lane near lead and outkicked while keeping on well. NEAH BAY settled off the
pace on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and into the lane and failed to threaten.
