Footnotes
COCOA CENTS was bumped leaving the break and was a bit rank into the first turn, rated just off of the pace along the backstretch run, saved ground to
the quarter marker, was roused four wide in upper stretch, overtook DESERT SMOKE inside of the furlong pole and kicked clear in the final stages.
GRIGORO settled off of the moderate pace, saved ground through the backstretch run, came three wide along the far turn, rallied six wide in upper stretch,
was no match for the winner in the final sixteenth but stayed on to get up for place in the final strides. DESERT SMOKE assumed command of the early
pace, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, was confronted nearing the quarter marker, turned away FANTASTIC SECRET and drew clear to
mid-stretch, could not hold off oncoming rivals in deep stretch, was edged for second in the final strides and just held for show. NICOLE GRACE was
unhurried in the early going, saved all of the ground to the second turn, found her best stride late and just missed for place and show. SILK ROAD SALLY
was allowed to settle along the first turn, advanced along the backstretch run to stalk the pace, ran evenly along the second turn, swung five wide into the
drive and flattened out in the final furlong. FANTASTIC SECRET was forwardly placed in the early stages, prompted the moderate pace to the second turn,
challenged DESERT SMOKE nearing the quarter marker, was turned away in that bid, chased to mid-stretch and tired in the final sixteenth.

O B'S settled off of the fast early pace, saved ground to the second turn, was roused leaving the three-furlong marker, swung three wide into the drive, took
command in upper stretch and drew off under firm hand urging in the final furlong to be much the best. HOT JOURNEY was unhurried, improved position
four wide on the far turn, was no match for the winner in the drive and held for second in the late stages. MOTHER'S PRAYER showed early speed leaving
the break and dueled for pace duties with NAUVOO into the backstretch run, shook free from that rival and drew clear heading to the far turn, was overtaken
in upper stretch, gave way in the final furlong and saved third in the final strides. MONEY MUNCHER settled off of the quick early pace, came two wide into
the backstretch run, swung to the inside on the second turn and did not produce a rally in the stretch. NAUVOO engaged with MOTHER'S PRAYER leaving
the break and dueled through fast early fractions with that rival, lost ground nearing the half-mile marker, stopped along the second turn and was not asked
for run in the stretch.

Footnotes
SPUN BEAUTIFUL was sent to contest the early pace, assumed command nearing the turn, extended the lead approaching the quarter marker while
carving out quick fractions, drew clear to mid-stretch and was geared down in the final sixteenth as much the best. PRINCESS CATERINA chased from the
inside through the turn, ducked in leaving the turn, recovered to improve position nearing the furlong pole, was no match for the winner in the late stages but
stayed on well in the end to be second best. GETAWAY CHARM chased the solid early pace, gained ground three wide on the turn, ran evenly to
mid-stretch and kept on in the final sixteenth to secure third. NASHIRA'S FIRE chased from the rear, came three wide into the turn, angled to the two path
for the drive and was not a late factor. DAD'S LADY broke alertly, tracked the quick fractions set by SPUN BEAUTIFUL, could not keep pace with that rival
leaving the turn and weakened in the late stages.

OTTAWA FIRE (IRE) was allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground through the backstretch run, improved position two wide on the far turn,
loomed in upper stretch, overtook FULL OF LUCK inside of the eighth pole and powered home in the final sixteenth. FULL OF LUCK (CHI) was away in
good order and was sent to contest the early lead, set a pressured moderate pace through the far turn, shook free of the pressing rival in upper stretch,
could not match strides with the winner inside of the furlong marker and was overtaken, while holding safely in the end for place. FRIDAY'S AT SHADY
tracked the early pace, advanced along the backstretch run, saved ground to the top of the lane, came within aim while improving position nearing the
furlong pole, was outkicked by the top pair late and was well clear for show in the end. AGENT ZERO was forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the
moderate pace three wide to the second turn, drifted out in upper stretch, came six wide nearing the furlong marker, could not keep pace in the final stages
and weakened. BIG CITY BANE settled in the second flight early on, came three wide into the backstretch run, was asked for run three wide nearing the
quarter pole and did not offer a late response. CANYON CREST shuffled at the start and was away slowly, was unhurried to the second turn and was not a
late factor. PHANTOM DROP showed good early speed, prompted the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, kept pressure on the pacesetter to
the quarter pole, drifted out at the top of the lane, lost ground nearing the furlong marker and tired in the late stages.

SPEED GRAZY was allowed to settle in the early going, came three wide into the backstretch run, loomed four wide on the second turn, took command in
upper stretch, kept to task inside of the furlong marker, drew off while ridden out in the final sixteenth and was much the best. QUE SERA SIR RALPH
tracked the early pace from the second flight, advanced along the backstretch run, came within aim while two wide nearing the quarter marker, lost ground
in upper stretch, was no match for SPEED GRAZY in the late stages but kept on in deep stretch to secure second. ATLANTIC FROG broke alertly and
established the early advantage, set quick fractions while pressed through the backstretch run, shook free nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace
with SPEED GRAZY leaving the second turn, gave way in the drive and just held for third in the final strides. AWKWARD MORNING stalked the solid early
fractions from the inside, maintained position to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth and was just edged for
show in the final strides. COMMAND A PREMIUM was forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the pace three wide into the backstretch run, lost
position three then four wide nearing the quarter marker and tired in the stretch run. CHARLIE THE GENT broke out at the start, bothered STAN THE HOT
MAN and was away slowly, lacked speed through the backstretch run, advanced three wide on the far turn, swung five wide for the drive and did not
produce a late rally. HAKUNUI showed early speed and pressed the rapid early pace, kept pressure on ATLANTIC FROG through the half-mile marker,
dropped back on the second turn and faltered. STAN THE HOT MAN was bothered at the start by CHARLIE THE GENT, settled off of the quick early
fractions, lost contact on the far turn, was eased through the stretch and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
STRUT ON LOUIE went head-to-head with CHROME'S ORBIT from the start, disposed of that one passing the three-sixteenths pole, repelled a bid by DR
LOW KEY in the final furlong and drew away in the end. DR LOW KEY lunged at the start, tracked the early speed duel, launched a rally approaching the
quarter pole, tipped out for room just past the three-sixteenths, made a run AT STRUT ON LOUIE, lost some ground when he failed to change leads but
finished well clear of the third horse. CHILLY WILLY veered in at the start, then over corrected and nearly came into contact with ONE BIG SMILE, settled
mid-pack chasing the leading pack to the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and was gaining late. IMPACT ZONE came away from the gate in good
order, raced mid-pack while very wide down the backstretch, angled to the three path into the turn, finished with some late interest while encountering traffic
in the stretch run. ONE BIG SMILE lost his path at the break and was away slowly, lacked early speed while green heading to the turn, came two wide to the
quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch, showed some greenness again through the lane and improved position in the final stages. SAXON SAGA broke
sharply, chased the dueling leaders to the top of the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. MOMO'S KIDDO was bothered by MISCHIEVOUS PIRATE
at the break and took up, dropped far behind the field early, swung five wide off of the turn and managed a mild late rally. MISCHIEVOUS PIRATE broke out
into the path of MOMO'S KIDDO after the break, chased the field to the turn, improved his position through the turn, ran on evenly and was not able to
threaten late. TOP HAT ARISTOCRAT bobbled at the start, was outrun early, swung four wide for the drive and lacked a late response. CHROME'S ORBIT
dueled with STRUT ON LOUIE leaving the break, engaged with that rival to set quick fractions to the quarter marker, lost position in upper stretch and tired
badly in the final furlong.

Footnotes
TRIBAL NATION was away alertly and showed good early speed into the first turn, drew to a clear lead entering the backstretch run, was well handled to
the half-mile marker, drew off on the far turn, was kept to task in the stretch run, had the lead cut into in deep stretch and stayed clear to the wire. KINGS
RIVER KNIGHT was forwardly placed in the early stages,came three wide into the backstretch run, slipped to the inside on the far turn, was no match for his
stablemate in the drive but closed into the margin in the final stages and was second best in the end. ROYAL 'N RANDO settled off of the early fractions,
came four wide into the backstretch run, improved position nearing the half-mile marker, chased three wide in pursuit on the second turn, gained ground in
the late going but could not reel in the top pair and was clear for third in the end. TABLE FOR TEN was unhurried in the early stages, came four wide along
the far turn while trailing, found his best stride late but was not able to impact the leaders in the final sixteenth. RUNKERRY showed early speed and tracked
the pacesetter through the backstretch run, lost contact with TRIBAL NATION on the far turn, lost position in upper stretch and weakened. MOUNT
PELLIAR settled off of the solid early pace, maintained position to the second turn and was not a threat in the late stages. LOAFERS BOY was unprepared
at the start and was away slowly, was allowed to settle, saved ground to the quarter marker, improved position in upper stretch but did not factor in the late
going. GERLACH'S settled in the second flight early on, came three wide into the backstretch run, maintained position to the quarter marker, dropped back
in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CLOVISCONNECTION away in good order, disputed the early pace to the turn, pressed EARLY RELEASE to the quarter marker, overtook that rival leaving
the turn, drew clear to mid-stretch, was kept to task in the drive and pulled away in the late stages. PASSARANDO was hard to load, was crowded at the
start and off a bit slowly, chased from the rear to the turn, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker, swung four wide for the drive, gained ground in
the final furlong, was no match for the winner in deep stretch and was up in time to secure second. CHASE THE CHAOS chased the early speed from the
second flight, came two wide along the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final stages and just held for show in the final strides.
STRENGTH OF AUTISM lacked early speed, saved ground while trailing along the turn, improved position in upper stretch, mounted a mild late rally and
just missed for show in the final strides. ABINADI broke out a bit at the start to crowd PASSARANDO, was forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the
pace three deep into the turn, lost position in upper stretch and weakened. EARLY RELEASE broke alertly and showed good early speed, engaged with
CLOVISCONNECTION to dispute the pace to the turn, set fast fractions while maintaining a narrow advantage to the top of the lane, could not keep pace
with the winner in upper stretch and tired in the final stages. HAVANA ANGEL (IRE) was a bit slow into early stride leaving the gate, chased the quick early
pace from the second flight, dropped back nearing the quarter marker, trailed to mid-stretch and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
BOUNDFORJAMAICA broke well, found a comfortable spot tracking the leaders while racing in the four path down the stretch, began a rally from the three
furlong pole, fanned four-wide into the home stretch and finished with determination to win by the narrowest of margins. ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) was
allowed to settle near the back of the field early, angled to the inside and made some forward progress into the turn, lacked running room through the turn,
dove to the rail in upper stretch, finished well and just missed in the final strides for the win, while securing the place. JAN JAN CAN had only one beat in the
early going, gained ground steadily through the turn, was put into a drive approaching the half-mile pole and finished with a strong rally to gain the show.
WICKED SUNSET was content to track from the middle of the pack down the backstretch, was boxed in through the turn and into the stretch, was gaining in
the final sixteenth but could not produce the needed late response. AUSTRIAN NAVY came away in good order, was content to race mid-pack and wide in
the early stages, started a rally from the seven-sixteenths marker, raced five wide around the turn, finished well while still wide down the lane but found best
stride too late. PULPIT SINGER was sent after the break, was within striking position from the five furlong pole to the stretch, was inside of several
challengers at the top of the lane loomed a threat to the furlong grounds but needed more in the final strides. SIMPLY PERFECT broke out at the start,
straightened and opened a clear lead to the top of the stretch, began to weaken in upper stretch and stopped badly in the final furlong. KISS RIDE
GOODBYE was off a step slowly, then bumped by AUSTRIAN NAVY, trailed the field by open lengths down the backstretch, swung five-wide into the
stretch and passed one late. MOON ROCKET broke from the gate quickest of all but was outrun to the turn by SIMPLY PERFECT, tracked that one to the
outside through the turn, was in middle of a mass of challengers at the three-sixteenths and was unable to keep up from there.
