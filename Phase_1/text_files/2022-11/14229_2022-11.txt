Footnotes
PRECIOUS BABY was off slow to begin, went up three wide into the first turn then dueled for command from outside, put away inner rival at the
five-sixteenths pole. SHOCKING GREY broke a step slow then lost his path and dropped back, went between rivals on the backstretch, got boxed in early
on the far turn, tipped out when in the clear and came four wide into the stretch, rallied and gained the place. CANDY ON TOP stalked two wide early then
three deep in the middle stages, took aim two wide into the stretch but could not summon the needed late kick in the final furlong and lost the place. SMART
MONIQUE chased three then two wide on the clubhouse turn, traveled three deep into the far turn, got floated to the four path around the bend, spun three
wide into the lane and lacked a late bid. MAGIC GAME stalked along the inside, shifted out around weakening rival and bumped outer rival on the far turn,
chased two wide into the lane and flattened. OAT MILK LATTE broke in and bumped MY YVONNE, settled off the pace on the inside, asked left handed
while tipping to the two path leaving the far turn and could not rally. MY YVONNE got bumped at the start, went up to duel from inside, fought to the far turn
then started two weaken around the bend and faded in the stretch. LINGER lagged behind early, trailed on the inside to the stretch and was not a factor.
THE BIG CAKE stalked on the inside then between rivals, got bumped to the three path on the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
GEEZER got shuffled back between rivals early, chased four wide into and around the turn, reached the front outside the eight pole and held MYSTIC
FLYER at bay. MYSTIC FLYER broke a step slow, steadied off heels twice early and dropped back, moved forward up the backstretch, went two wide into
the turn, steadied behind rival early on the bend, angled out and entered the lane five wide, drew alongside GEEZER in deep stretch and could not get by
while clearly second best. FUN MONEY stalked the pace early then bid three deep into the turn, dueled for command from outside and took over nearing
the quarter pole, showed the way three wide into the stretch, lost command outside the eight pole and flattened to third. AMIGO G A bobbled slightly at the
start, unhurried in the early going, went two wide into the turn, angled four wide around the bend and passed tired rivals. HACKING IT UP pressed from
inside early, took over at the three-eighths pole, dueled with FUN MONEY and relinquished the lead outside the quarter pole, fought to the top of the lane
and weakened. MIDNIGHT LIGHTNING took control early and set the pace outside HACKING IT UP, lost command with three furlongs remaining, could not
go on with the top pair and angled to the inside and tired in stretch.

the stretch, lost command outside the sixteenth pole and held the place. MONTANA dueled for the lead from outside, vied between on the turn and into the
stretch, fought through the lane and stayed on well for third. SHIP AND SCAM chased 3deep into and around the bend, moved out in the stretch and lacked
a bid. YO TIME chased on the inside, drifted a bit in to the turn, remained inside to the stretch and could not offer the needed response. MAN O ROSE was
off a bit slow, steadied early then became hart to ride up the backstretch, drifted five wide around the turn and kept on while unable to threaten.
REGULATION DAZED was fractious in the gate, steadied off heels early, chased between to the stretch, tipped out and could not rally. HONDO CROUCH
was off slow to begin, traveled three deep then between rivals, asked two to three wide on the turn and lacked a rally. STAR PROSPECT raced up close
from outside, bid three deep on the turn, could not keep up past the quarter pole and retreated in the lane. BUCK OWENS settled on the inside, angled four
wide around the turn, moved back inward in the stretch and failed to menace. DO IT FOR DAVE was off slow to begin and trailed early, went six wide into

Footnotes
VIOLENT RUNNER got bumped and lost path early, went up to press at the half-mile pole from outside, vied three deep on the turn, lost touch with the
leaders past the quarter pole, came back and got up between rivals. LADY T raced in mid-pack early then started to climb near the seven-sixteenths pole,
went two wide into the turn, angled out and came six wide into the stretch, rallied and challenged three deep late and just missed. AMERICAN LILY bobbled
leaving the gate, stalked early then went up to press between rivals, fought through the turn and into the lane, held a short lead in upper stretch, cleared at
the eighth pole but got run down by the top pair in the closing moments. PEACE PEDDLER bumped inner rival at the start, cleared early and crossed over
then took pressure at the half-mile pole, vied with rivals around the turn, could not match strides entering the furlong grounds and weakened to fourth.
HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN bumped leaving the gate, dropped back early, raced two wide into the turn, angled five to six wide into the stretch and improved
position. MONGOLIAN PANTHER tracked the pace on the inside into and around the bend and lacked a rally. DEL MAR DRAMA raced on the inside near
the pace, tipped off the rail and failed to rally. ACT OF SERENDIPITY trailed to the turn, saved ground to the lane and never threatened. TIP TOP GAL
traveled three deep near the back, entered the lane four to five wide and failed to make an impact. SHE'S GOT A WAY broke a bit slow, moved closer up
the backstretch, chased two wide into the turn, moved out and left the turn five wide and faded. HOLY TUTTA BELLA bumped at the start, raced between
foes near the back, came three wide into the drive and was not a factor.

TIME TO PARTY pulled on the inside early, let loose on the far turn and was gaining rapidly, took over from outside with three-sixteenths remaining, moved
clear then held when DURANTE came again late. DURANTE sped clear and moved inside, led clear to the quarter pole, lost command at the
three-sixteenths pole, chased the winner into the final furlong then came back on late but was unable to get by. SPIRIT MAKER got bumped at the start,
settled two wide, moved closer three deep backstretch, got blocked behind a weakening rival at the five-sixteenths pole steered into the two path, then
rallied to gain the show. DANIEL'S MAGIC steadied off heels between rivals nearing the first turn, roused on the far turn then lacked room at the quarter
pole, came three wide into the lane and got edged for the show. HALFBARBERBINGIE was off slow to begin, moved to the inside racing at the back, saved
ground then had to pause behind rivals nearing the quarter pole, angled out in the stretch and summoned a mild rally. ONE FAST BRO unhurried in the
beginning, advanced four to five wide on the far turn, moved out in the lane and lacked further response. STOTLAND was closest in pursuit from the two
path early, roused on the far turn, chased the top pair into the stretch and weakened. COOL YOUR JETS raced in mid-pack two wide outside a rival, tipped
four wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. BRIX was along the inside in mid-pack early, tipped out into the stretch, angled to the inside and could not rally.
BUD KNIGHT had to check off heels ealry, tracked three deep on both turns and tired. BRIT'S WIT bumped at the start, pulled on the inside then stalked,
cut the corner into the stretch, crowded by BRIX at the eight pole and faded.

DEFUNDED bobbled leaving the gate, went up to vie three deep into the first turn then dueled outside GO JOE WON, inched ahead at the quarter pole,
cleared and crossed over exiting the bend, then widened under left handed urging and coasted in late. AZUL COAST was off slow and inward at the start,
chased between rivals then got blocked by NEW GRANGE, tipped out into the backstretch, trailed to the far turn, advanced four deep around the bend and
rallied for the place. NEWGRANGE vied between early then dropped back to stalk on the clubhouse turn, asked two wide on the second bend and was
along for the show. GO JOE WON vied with rivals into the first turn then dueled inside DEFUNDED, fought into and around the far turn, lost contact with the
winner entering the stretch and weakened down the lane. TIZAMAGICIAN stalked the top pair from inside, lost ground around the far turn and came up
empty in the drive. PARNELLI chased three deep early, roused three wide around the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
MO THEM DOWN took control early from inside, set all the pace to the stretch, led clear into the final sixteenth and held over the late charge from the
runner-up. CIRCLEOFCHAMPIONS stalked the speed along the rail to the stretch, tipped out in the lane, launched a bid in the final sixteenth but was too
late. ARREST raced in range three wide to the stretch, lacked the needed late kick to threaten the top pair but held the show. NEVER SEEN BEFORE (IRE)
raced three then two wide early, went between foes in mid-pack, angled out and improved position. HOODLUM pulled early on the inside, went between
foes in the middle stages, angled out into the stretch and failed to threaten. CANELO was keen early outside the leader then took a stalking position, was
closest in pursuit from the two path then flattened out in the stretch. IF ID TOLD YOU was off a bit slow in the beginning, tracked four wide around the first
turn, three wide on the second bend and could not rally. CHRIS FIX trailed on the inside early, came three wide into the lane and never got inolved. TOFINO
BAY unhurried on the inside, coaxed up the backstretch, asked right handed and failed to responded. QUICK INTRO tracked off the rail then moved into the
two path, saved ground on the inside through the far turn and never rallied. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) was rank five wide early then settled in the two path,
steadied behind a rival on the first turn, moved out three deep on the backstretch, rounded the final turn four deep and was not a factor.
