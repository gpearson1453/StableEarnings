Footnotes
FULMINATE bumped inner rival early then showed speed outside rivals, cleared past the half-mile pole, showed the way on the inside through the turn,
maintained a comfortable lead into deep stretch under left and right handed urging in the lane and held well in the end. R GIRL'S WERTH IT got bumped at
the start then bumped by outer rival twice shortly after, showed speed inside a pair of rivals then got put in tight and steadied near the half-mile pole, chased
along the rail then tipped two wide on the turn, put in a mild late bid in the final sixteenth but was not enough to get by. INVINCIBELLA (GB) unhurried in the
beginning, trailed on the inside through the turn, summoned a mild rally near the fence in the lane and got up for third. O'NEILL'S LEGACY bumped leaving
the gate, raced near the back on the inside into the turn, tipped out exiting the bend, moved out further in the stretch and got outkicked for third.
REDSTWIRLINGDANCER got knocked into inner rival early then bumped with that same rival again early, showed speed between rivals then got crowded
by FULMINATE near the half-mile pole, remained in range and was closest in pursuit from inside through the turn, then weakened in the final furlong.
BLUSHING (FR) was off slow to begin, raced outside a rival into the turn near the back, came three wide into the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
ICE DANCING dueled for the lead from inside into the first turn then cleared around the bend, showed the way up the backstretch, challenged by
DOINITTHEHARDWAY on the far turn, met the challenge and responded well by inching clear again in the stretch and remained strong to the wire under
left handed urging. DOINITTHEHARDWAY broke alertly and dueled outside ICE DANCING into the first turn, yielded command and stalked from outside
around the bend, stayed close up in the middle stages, re-engaged the leader on the far turn, lost touch with a furlong remaining and was clearly second
best. MONIQUE was off slow in the beginning, chased three wide at the back early on, went four wide into the far turn, angled down to the two path while
outside a rival on the final bend and gained the show. MOONLIT MISCHIEF tracked from inside, had the rider lose his whip entering the backstretch,
chased inside through the far turn while losing ground and weakened under hand urging. CARMEL BY THE SEA raced two wide off the pace, angled from
the three path down to the rail on the far turn and failed to menace. DIVINELY BOLT stumbled badly at the start, losing the rider in the process and walked
off after being caught by the outrider past the finish line.

Footnotes
NAISMITH stalked three deep early, took aim three wide into the stretch, bid three deep with a furlong remaining, got bumped midstretch, took over in the
final sixteenth and proved best in the end. THE KEY IS UNITY was antsy in the starting gate, unhurried in the beginning from inside, lacked room to
advance past the quarter pole, remained inside and rallied along the fence to get up for second. PIROLI got pinballed leaving the gate, settled between
rivals, steered out in the stretch, rallied and missed the place. MITAD DEL MUNDO broke out, raced in range on the inside, tipped out in upper stretch, bid
between rivals at the eighth pole, got knocked into outer rival midstretch and kept on to round out the superfecta. MASTERMIND broke in and bumped
PIROLI, sprinted clear and moved inside, set all the pace to the stretch, lugged out and bumped foe midstretch and yielded in the final sixteenth. OMERTA
CODE dropped back early, raced in the two path early, moved inside briefly on the far turn then came two wide into the lane, steered out in the stretch and
lacked a rally. LIL BRO COOP broke out and bumped rival, was closest in pursuit early on from the two path, remained two wide into the lane, chased
between in upper stretch, then weakened in the furlong grounds. IVORY SKY settled three deep early on, remained three wide into the drive and failed to
menace. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE INCIDENT IN THE STRETCH RUN AND RULED THAT ALTHOUGH MASTERMIND DID INTERFERE WITH
MITAD DEL MUNDO AND NAISMITH, BOTH THOSE RIVALS BEAT MASTERMIND AND NO CHANGE WOULD NEED TO BE MADE.

Footnotes
BLACK MAGICIAN took control from inside, set the pace under pressure to the turn, dueled around the bend, inched ahead into the lane, shook free under
the crop midstretch and drew away. KING ZOG broke out and bumped rival, went up to prompt the pace from outside, battled around the turn, kept the
pressure on to midstretch, then failed to kick on with the winner in the final sixteenth and stayed on to secure second. STAY IN THE GAME got bumped
hard in the hind-quarters in the beginning, chased two to three wide into the lane and finished evenly late. CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY got pinballed leaving
the gate, chased four wide into the turn, six wide into the lane and improved position. GLASS BEACH got bumped hard leaving the gate, chased four deep
into the turn, came five wide into the lane and weakened. REEF CITY bumped at the start, chased three deep up the backstretch, went three to four wide
into the drive and weakened. KRIXUS FLASH shifted out and bumped rival in the beginning, was bit rank early on, started to climb leaving the backstretch
and early on the turn, went two wide into the lane and had little left for the drive. STORMY JOE got knocked into outer rival at the start, was a bit rank early,
chased three wide near the back into the turn and tired.

Footnotes
SUNSHINE BABE stalked three wide then outside a rival early, bid three deep into the stretch, took over and kicked clear in the lane, lugged out and
bumped CARMEN MIRANDA with a sixteenth remaining and held that rival at bay. CARMEN MIRANDA was fractious in the gate, rated on the inside out of
range, angled out and spun three wide into the stretch, tipped out and drew alongside the leader then got bumped at the sixteenth pole and finished gamely
to the wire. LA DEUXIEME ETOILE was reserved in the early going in the two path, remained under a hold and ran up on heels and had to steady at the
three-eighths pole, angled out and came four wide into the stretch, rallied outside the top pair while drifting out and lacked the needed late punch. DON'T JU
FORGET rated in the two path outside a rival early, bid between and brushed with inner rival at the three-sixteenths pole and was no match for the top trio in
the final furlong. TRUE PATRIOT broke a step slow, angled to the inside while racing near the back, steered three wide leaving the far turn and summoned
a mild rally when called upon. STARSHIP SKY was off a bit slow to start, trailed two wide early on, moved out on the backstretch and went four deep
leaving into the second bend, exited that turn six wide and could not rally. AVERY BLUE unhurried in the beginning, went three then two wide around the
clubhouse turn, got shuffled between foes on the far turn, came four wide into the drive and lacked a rally. NICE ICE pressed the pace from outside, took
over early on the far turn, put away inner rival with a quarter mile remaining, brushed with rival at the top of the lane and relinquished command, then gave
way in the final furlong. BUSKER ALLIE raced three deep towards the rear on the clubhouse turn, traveled four deep into the far turn, entered the lane five
wide and failed to make an impact. SOUL SWEET stalked the pace on the inside, tipped two wide at the quarter pole and faded in the stretch run. FLYING
TO THE LINE sped to the front and angled inside, set the pace under pressure to the far turn, relinquished the lead early on the bend, lost touch with the
leader nearing the quarter pole and folded up in the lane. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE INCIDENT AT THE SIXTEENTH POLE AND DISQUALIFIED
SUNSHINE BABE FROM FIRST TO SECOND FOR SHIFTING OUT AND MAKING CONTACT WITH CARMEN MIRANDA WHICH COST HER A CHANCE
AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
BREAKFAST RIDE dueled early then ceded command and moved to a stalking position, raced on the inside then tipped two then three wide late on the far
turn, lacked room into the stretch, bumped a rival trying to get through, then surged when gaining a clear path and drove clear. HOLDEN THE LUTE stalked
the pace on the inside, altered out at the three-eighths pole, rallied four to five wide, took over at the eighth pole but yielded to the winner in the late stages.
ORDER AND LAW settled three then two wide early, moved closer widest on the backstretch, bid four deep into the far turn, vied three deep and took over
around the bend, lost command at the eight pole and flattened to third. HERO STATUS tracked two wide early then between foes into the far turn, got put in
tight around the bend then came three wide into the stretch, tipped out in the lane and kept on for a minor share. FIGURETI (CHI) tossed his head at the
start, trailed to the far turn, passed a rival and came three wide into the drive, angled out and put in a mild late rally to improve placings. IT'S MY HOUSE
chased four wide early, bid three deep with three furlongs remaining, took over on the far turn the lost command at the quarter pole, got bumped at the top
of the lane and fought to upper stretch, then weakened in the final furlong. MR. IMPOSSIBLE sat off the pace four then three wide along the first turn,
moved closer up the backstretch and went three deep into the far turn, came four wide into the lane and failed to menace. ARKAAN dueled into the first turn
then cleared and angled in, set the pace under pressure in the middle stages, challenged by a trio of rivals into the far turn, relinquished command early on
the bend and gave way. DR PESCADO was forwardly placed early in the three path then went up to apply pressure from outside, vied between into the far
turn, dropped back and got bumped around that bend and tired.

Footnotes
PRINCE ABAMA (IRE) broke alertly then was closest in pursuit of the leader from outside on the first turn, drew alongside then took over on the clubhouse
turn, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, shook free leaving the final bend and held well under a drive. THE GREY WIZARD (IRE) was off slow
from inside, settled off the pace, went between foes on the backstretch, moved back to the rail on the last turn, tipped out in the lane, finished willingly in
deep stretch and held the place. AVENUE got put in tight between rivals early, tracked under a hold, two to three wide, chased four deep at the
three-eighths pole, took aim three wide into the stretch, finished determinedly in the final sixteenth and missed the place. DICEY MO CHARA (GB) settled
three wide early, moved to the two path for the second bend, trailed leaving the backstretch, spun three wide into the lane and gained a minor award while
failing to threaten. CASH EQUITY (FR) had to check inside rivals early, started to pull on the first turn, moved up to press the pace from between, stayed
alongside the leader then lost touch leaving the far turn, got crowded between rivals at the eight pole and flattened. DEAN MARTINI had to check early,
gave chase then moved up to press three deep, dropped back on the far turn, entered stretch two wide and tired. GO ON bobbled leaving the gate, rushed
up between to take the lead and moved clear, lost command around the clubhouse turn, stalked on the inside, lost ground chasing through the final turn and
weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
REINCARNATE stepped to the front from inside, set the pace while under pressure from rivals, cleared with three-sixteenths remaining and held gamely in
the end. MR FISK tracked four wide into the first turn then angled to the two path, came two wide into the drive, angled out in the stretch, finished well and
edged RIVERSIDE for the place. RIVERSIDE forwardly placed three deep early, challenged outside rivals on the far turn, lost contact and chased the
winner into the stretch, stayed on through the lane and got edged for second. ODONATA pressed the pace in the two path between rivals, chased
REINCARNATE past the quarter pole and flattened down the lane. EASTBOUND tracked five then four wide on the clubhouse turn, remained well off the
rail on the second bend and could not rally. CLOONEY steered down to the inside early racing near the back, trailed into the far turn, angled three wide on
the far turn and failed to menace. OMNIPRESENT was off slow slow to begin then became rank soon after, traveled two wide at the back on the first turn,
remained off the rail in the middle stages near the rear of the field, went between rivals at the three-eighths pole, exited that bend two wide and was not a
factor. TELOS had to steady three wide at the three-quarter pole then chased out of range early on, saved ground into the lane and came up empty.

Footnotes
A CROWN FOR KITTEN unhurried in the beginning, tucked inside on the first turn, tipped out at the three-sixteenths pole, angled out further in the stretch,
rallied five deep with a sixteenth remaining and got up in time. TIERGARTEN vied three deep then took up on the first turn and angled down to the rail,
angled four wide around the far turn, launched a bid in the stretch, took over in the final sixteenth but got nailed by the winner. JERUSALEMA (IRE) angled
to the inside chasing the leaders into the first turn, traveled in mid-pack up the backstretch, saved ground into the lane, tipped out and put in a mild bid
between rivals and gained the show. VULIN unhurried in the beginning and steered to the two path, raced in mid-pack between rivals in the middle stages,
spun three wide into the lane, moved out and kept on to earn a minor award. RUBY RAY vied for the lead from the rail into the first turn, inched ahead
around the bend, showed the way to the far turn, dueled around that bend and into the lane, cleared briefly outside the eight pole, was soon challenged
once again and yielded with a sixteenth to go. ABOVE SUSPICION sat off the pace on the inside, moved into range in the middle stages, tipped out and
bumped rival into the stretch then lost her path shortly after, moved to a clear lane and kept on while unable to threaten. SADDLE UP JESSIE vied four
deep into the first turn then dropped back to chase and angled to the two path, raced outside a rival into the far turn, came three wide into the lane and got
bumped by ABOVE SUSPICION, put in a bid midstretch but flattened out late. TIZ MY PRINCESS settled on the inside then two wide around the first turn,
angled out and came four wide into the drive, tipped out in the stretch and failed to make an impact. BUY AMERICAN popped the gate open but did not
come through, pulled early while showing speed between rivals, pressed the leader from outside to the far turn, battled head to head around that bend,
could not keep up entering the furlong grounds and weakened. BOSSY PEGASUS also popped the gate open but did not come through, bumped with outer
rival at the start, moved to the inside while near the back, trailed in the middle stages, saved ground to the stretch and never got involved. NATALIA broke a
step slow, went up five deep on the front end into the first turn, took back and angled down to the two path, went three wide into the far turn then came five
wide into the drive and tired.
