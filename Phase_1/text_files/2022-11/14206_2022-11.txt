Footnotes
BELENTIME had a perfect tracking trip behind the engaging co leaders down the backstretch, began to close in midpoint on the far turn, took control easily
outside of foes at the quarter pole and drew away comfortably in the final eighth. BREACH OF TRUST made a good move at the start to get near the rail
into the first turn, continued a ground saving trip on the fence in midfield at the half, rallied five sixteenths from home inside, shifted out four wide two
furlongs from the wire commencing his run and ran on through the stretch to be a clear but non threatening second at the finish. POT COMMITTED travelled
four wide in the middle of the field into the first turn, took closer order to the frontrunners racing down the backstretch, was ridden to keep pace with the
leaders four wide two furlongs from the finish and showed some good late energy to close in and capture the show award. MIDNIGHT SAINT trailed the field
going three wide into the first turn, put in an early move around runners seven sixteenths from the line, rallied six wide with two furlongs remaining and could
only finish evenly through the lane to settle on the fringes. GRAND GIZMO set the fractions just outside while being pressured down the backside, began to
draw away from the early pace challenger on the far turn, was collared by the winner at the quarter pole outside and retreated in upper stretch.
SNOOKERED travelled five wide near the back entering the first turn, settled outside in midfield at the half, was roused inside of horses midpoint on the far
turn and passed weary runners through the lane. SETTEBELLO settled near the rear on the rail, saved ground throughout the race, was roused inside on
the far turn but could never get involved and made no impact in the stretch drive. NGABE pressed the pace in the early stages inside, gave way on the rail
at the quarter marker and faltered on the fence turning for home. UNBRIDLED INFERNO tracked in mid pack into the first turn, was shuffled racing down
the backside to trail the field into the far turn, offered little run in the late stages and was not not a factor running the to the wire.

Footnotes
BURNING MAN raced three to four wide early, advanced outside up the backstretch, took over just past the three-eighths, moved in a bit late on the far turn
once clear, drew away in upper stretch and held safe. VELOCE rated in behind inside, came out two to three wide on the far turn, was no match for the
winner but second best. SAILOR'S PASSION eased back off the leaders racing two to three wide early, continued to move backward heading to the far turn,
was encouraged along outside the three-eighths traveling three to four wide, came out in upper stretch and kicked on belatedly. TRINITY GOLD settled last
but one shifting near inside, came out five wide heading up the backstretch, advanced on the far turn looming a threat at the quarter pole but could not
sustain the effort and evened out. JEGOS FIRE was coaxed forward to set the pace inside, lacked the needed late kick. COLEYVILLE broke a step slowly
and lacked early speed racing inside at the rear, moved out six wide leaving the first turn, advanced widest on the far turn, drifted out in upper stretch and
weakened. DANI'S VICTORY settled off the pace inside, came out three wide on the far turn, ran on. LION KINGDOM stalked two to three wide, asked for
more by the three-eighths, dropped back and tired.

DILETTANTE tracked three wide down the backstretch, bid for the lead between runners in upper stretch, fought on determinedly with rivals on either side
through the lane and stubbornly prevailed getting the nod at the the finish line. FORESTER'S TURN was situated three wide racing in midfield at the half,
made an early move to get a good position into the turn, closed in on the leaders five sixteenths left to run, bid outside of horses at the top of the lane and
fought on courageously only to lose out narrowly missing the bob at the wire. MARTEN RIVER broke sharp the lead the field, continued to dictate the pace
running on the turn, was collared by the winner outside at the top of the stretch, battled until the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly to settle for the
show money. OCELOT trailed the field in the early stages, rallied with three furlongs to the prize around horses, appeared to be in tight surroundings at the
quarter mile marker, rallied five wide at the eighth pole and closed for a minor share. FIELDER tracked on the rail in the beginning stages, was urged for
more run inside two furlongs remaining, offered little response and raced evenly down the lane. CHECKERBOARD FLOOR travelled four wide in the middle
of the pack down the backstretch, could not keep up with runners racing outside on the turn and played no role running through the stretch. GHOUL (BRZ)
was steadied briefly inside while eager in tight quarters behind runners seven sixteenths from the wire, regrouped midpoint on the turn, steadied again on
the rail at the two furlong marker and could not overcome that incident to be a threat afterwards. CELEBRATORY settled near the rear at the half, was
steadied sharply between fellow rivals at the quarter pole and could not recover in time to be involved in the stretch run. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL AND
STEWARDS INQUIRY #5 CELEBRATORY AGAINST #4 OCELOT AT THE QUARTER POLE RESULTED IN A DISQUALIFACTION OF #4 OCELOT FOR
INTERFERENCE AND WAS PLACED LAST

Footnotes
LAPOCHKA was reserved inside toward the back, saved ground in behind rivals along the fence through the far turn, came out in mid-stretch for room,
quickened to drive past inside the final sixteenth to prevail over SOLAR, who was up close stalking two to three wide and between runners in the second
flight, lost position having to wait in behind runners midway on the far turn, found room at the rail past the quarter pole, angled out a couple paths at the
furlong marker for room, struck the lead briefly near the sixteenth but was outfinished. SELFMADE angled in two to three wide early racing toward the rear,
steadied slightly in behind runners past the quarter pole seeking room, steadied a bit more sharply past the three-sixteenths, was able to split rivals at the
eighth pole and finished strongly. SEGUIMI moved forward to set the pace racing just off the rail, was pressured a bit up the backstretch, weakened in the
lane. RELIABILITY got away very slowly spotting the field about five or six lengths, raced at the rear near the inside but off the rail, came out leaving the first
turn, fanned seven wide turning for home, kicked on mildly. TIMESKIP was forced four to five wide on the first turn racing off the pace and outside runners,
advanced five then six wide on the far turn, evened out in the stretch. GENDRAGON settled off the fence racing off the rail mid-pack, lacked room and was
shuffled back on the far turn to be last at the quarter pole, shifted out at that juncture swinging nine deep into upper stretch, ran on mildly. HYPERFOCUS
raced outside three to five wide toward the back early, was forced widest while advancing on the far turn coming eight deep past the quarter pole, lacked the
needed late kick. ROCKET JOE COPPER was forwardly-placed outside four to five wide, weakened in the stretch. DERZKII tracked up close saving ground
inside, was within striking distance entering the far turn, was empty for the drive. NATIVE PRINCE raced mid-pack three wide early, gradually moved out
five wide on the far turn, dropped back and faded. SOCIETY JOE pressed the pace three wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
THREE SONNY SIDEUP travelled four wide into the first turn, tracked the loose leader just off the fence down the backside, had dead aim on the speed
frontrunner at the quarter pole, took command in mid stretch to open up at the sixteenth pole and won comfortably holding on well in the end. GLENHOLME
hit the gate at the break, was steadied entering the first turn to trail in the early stages, made an early move into the backstretch four wide get a good
tracking spot at the half, rallied three wide three furlongs from the wire, offered a bid in the four path turning for home and chased the winner in vain through
the stretch. ROCK BULLET was unhurried in the beginning, trailed the field at the half mile marker, was coaxed three eighths to the line, began to pick up
runners four wide on the second turn, angled out to be widest in the six path turning for home and closed well to get up for third. TWIXTER stalked inside
midfield at the half mile marker, was urged left handed three eighths from the finish for more run, slipped up the fence at the top of the lane and continued to
battle on running between horses at the furlong marker for a small share. COHERENCE was situated near the back of the pack entering the far turn, began
to put in a mild rally three wide around runners with five sixteenths remaining, contended four wide at the top of the stretch for a share and stalled in the final
sixteenth. MORSTACHY'S settled inside mid pack down the backside, advanced on the fence into the far turn, was ridden to go on two furlongs to the finish,
angled out five wide turning for home with a chance for a minor share and could only offer an even finish to the wire. WICKEDBLACKBULLET dictated the
pace throughout the early running of the race, lead the field down the backside, was collared by the winner outside at the top of the stretch, offered little
resistance at the furlong marker and weakened on the fence the last sixteenth. DOMI travelled four wide into the first turn, had a good position tracking three
wide while in hand down the backstretch, was ridden to keep pace midpoint on the far turn and retreated between runners at the top of the lane.
PASSIONPLATE stalked in the middle of the pack running down the backstretch, was ridden between rivals early on with a half mile remaining, could not
quicken with foes entering the far turn, by the three eighths pole was shuffled back to last and could not offer a finish in the stretch.

Footnotes
CURLIN'S GHOST was forced in a bit after the break, raced toward the back four wide early, advanced on the far turn while swinging eight wide, drifted in
through upper- and mid-stretch while striking the lead about a furlong out, was kept to the task. WHITEWALKER raced mid-pack mostly three wide, found
room between runners in upper stretch, kept on inside the winner but was only second best. SAMMY STONE stalked just off the leaders about three to four
wide early, was within striking distance coming past the quarter pole, floated five wide out of that second turn, kept on late to regain show honors.
CHAMBER MUSIC moved forward and clear inside to set the pace, faced pressure up the backstretch and on the far turn while coming out a bit out of that
bend, was overtaken by mid-stretch and outkicked. VINCENZINO settled just off the leaders stalking two to three wide, kept on evenly. TWO RIVERS
OVER was hard to handle in the early stages bumping and forcing a rival in tight quarters while moving out in the two to three path while well off the leaders,
eventually settled down, moved out from three to four wide on the far turn brushing a foe leaving the bend, ran on from between runnres. CALUSA DONNIE
stalked just off the leaders three to four wide early, fanned out seven wide leaving the far turn while put to urging midway on that bend, ran evenly in the
lane. ARMALINE broke a step slowly, was bumped and in tight three to four wide heading into the first turn, began to advance outside the same rival four to
five wide on the far turn, was brushed by that one and altered out abruptly nine deep past the quarter pole, ran on. FIGHTING IRISH moved forward under
encouragement from outside while moving in to press, raced mostly three to four wide and in contention to upper stretch, came up empty. MAGIC
TOMAHAWK angled in about two wide early, raced off the rail and off the pace throughout, failed to menace. UNCAPTURED MOMENT was outpaced
trailing early shifting in, swung seven to eight wide for the drive, failed to make a bid. GREYSTONE raced on or off the rail early, appeared to be looking for
room two to three wide leaving the far turn, steadied about the three-sixteenths and faced traffic, put back to a drive near the eighth pole but had to check
again coming near the sixteenth pole and was not persevered with.

Footnotes
RALPHIE BOY had a stalking trip on the rail down the backside, advanced inside on the far turn, found the seam three wide at the top of the lane, burst
through runners at the furlong pole and had enough late to hold for the victory. INDY CHAMPAGNE was situated in the middle of the pack with rivals on
either side at the half, was ridden between foes five sixteenths from the wire to start a rally, angled out five wide for the stretch run to be in contention and
could not find another gear to threaten the winner in deep stretch. GOLDEN BURN was allowed to settle early and trailed the field down the backstretch,
began to find his momentum three furlongs from the wire outside of runners, could still see them all angling out eighth wide for the drive and found his best
stride late to put in a good finish closing well to get up late for third. MAGNIFICENT MARIO travelled near the back of the field under a snug hold with four
furlongs left to the finish, was roused three wide at the three eighths pole, circled around foes on the far turn to bid six wide turning for home and stalled
outside the last sixteenth. REBEL FAITH had a good inside trip tracking the engaging leaders down the backside, waited on the rail behind the battling trio
midway on the far turn, lacked running room behind the fading pacesetters in upper stretch and found a seam late to finish up with good energy nearing the
wire. GUARD OF HONOUR rated in mid pack while on hold four wide outside rivals with a half remaining, was coaxed for run midway on the turn,
responded well to have his nose in front in the five path at the top of the lane and weakened between horses at the furlong marker. SOVEREIGN CAUSE
pressed the issue just outside at the half, hounded the frontrunner on the far turn, was headed at the top of the lane while contesting for the lead and
faltered between runners at the furlong marker. BILL NEEDLE took command on the rail on the first turn, set the pace down the backside, battled for the
front through the far turn, was collared my numerous outside challengers turning for home and folded the final eighth. GO TAKE CHARGE settled three wide
in midfield into the first turn, tracked outside watching the co leaders with four furlongs remaining, offered a mild bid three wide to make it a trio dueling up
front at the quarter pole and gave way quickly between foes at the top of the stretch and galloped across the wire in the end.

CANADIAN PHAROAH was bumped at the break, settled inside foes but just off the fence early, took closer order on the far turn, came out at the top of the
stretch, struck the lead past the furlong marker and held off a late challenge from GRANDSON, who broke out bumping the aforementioned, settled just off
the rail, came out for room in upper stretch, gained steadily and slowly but too late. FULL EXTREME settled in the two path off the pace, was asked for
more past the three-eighths, swung widest of all to be eleven deep in upper stretch, gained but too late. SIR SAHIB broke outwardly and awkwardly, raced
toward the back inside, angled ten wide turning for home, ran on mildly. BRINGER OF RAIN broke a step slowly then angled in three wide, raced in the
back half, swung nine wide advancing leaving the far turn, ran on evenly. STEAK AND CHEESE stalked three wide, made a brief bid nearing the eighth pole
but had no late kick. MALIBU UPROAR raced mid-pack stalking outside three wide early, advanced some three then four wide on the far turn moving out
seven or eight deep turning for home, was in tight quarters at that juncture and lacked a rally thereafter. MAD MOCHA moved clear to set the pace racing off
the rail and in hand, came up empty.

Footnotes
RELOAD'S RASCAL was away slowly at the start, then hustled on the rail to get the lead running down the backside, continued to set the pace on the turn,
found another gear in mid stretch and had enough to hold off the closing foes at the finish line. BE LIKE CLINT was unhurried early to trail the field in the
beginning, rallied outside five sixteenths from the finish, was gaining steadily while widest in the five path through the lane and closed well to get for the
place share at the line. HEAT MERCHANT stalked comfortably near the back all alone into the turn, waited for his queue three eighths from the finish,
began to pass rivals midway on the turn, angled four wide to be in with a chance in the stretch drive and finished well but lost the battle for the place award
at the wire. SOUPER RUSH had a good spot outside watching the frontrunners midway on the turn, took closer order three wide to threaten the winner at
the top of the lane and stalled in the last sixteenth. HIDDEN HONOR was ridden early down the backside to keep pace, could not keep up with foes on the
turn and trailed turning for home, angled out widest in the five path at the eighth pole, shifted inwards with a sixteenth to run and finished with late interest.
JIMMIES BIG DAY travelled in the middle of the pack at the half, advanced up the rail to be in range of the leaders at the quarter pole, could not quicken
inside in upper stretch and was one paced down the lane. LIGHT THE LAMP broke inwards at the start, chased the winner down the backstretch, continued
in vain to keep up to the winner throughout turn, gave way at the eighth pole appearing to be getting in while under left handed urging in upper stretch and
tired in nearing the wire. SILVER SMOKE stumbled then was brushed by an outside foe at the break, stalked between horses down the backside, was
roused three furlongs left to run, lost ground to rivals through the turn and could not get involved for the drive.

BEYOND BORDERS settled off the pace, advanced three wide passing between rivals, took the lead at the eighth pole, edged clear under vigorous hand
urging and was taken in hand late. BIG LEAGUE stalked two to three wide, took the lead at the quarter pole, was overtaken a furlong out, proved no match
but second best. HIGH HEAT exchanged a bump at the start, was forwardly-positioned stalking four wide, ran on evenly. DUKE OF MIAMI settled off the
pace two to three wide till turning for home, angled six to seven wide for the drive and ran on. THELONIOUS saved ground tracking inside to the top of the
stretch, came out three wide, ran on evenly. ABSTEMIOUS bumped with a rival at the start, lacked early speed racing at the tail, swung five wide, ran on.
ROYAL BIZ moved clear quickly with mild coaxing, set the pace inside on or just off the rail, weakened. RADCLIFFE chased four to five wide, dropped back
and faded.
