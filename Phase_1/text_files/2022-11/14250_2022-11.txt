CUSTOM CANDY went to the front under pressure then shook loose on the turn and held off outside challenge late in the stretch for the win. YOU HAVE
NO IDEA tracked the leaders from off the rail made a late bid and just missed. DREAMED I AM FAST raced near the back on the inside made a rail bid to
be up for the show. COZZOLANI was void of the early speed and passed tiring rivals. CREEK RAIN raced in the middle of the pace from four wide and was
never a factor. EARLY DAWN vied for the early lead and gave way.

G VICTORY went to the frond to set a clear lead throughout and was much the best. CRIMSON STORM stalked the pace from the three path to the final
turn then made a bid on the winner but was no match. HIGHTAIL COWBOY tracked the leaders from the two path through the final turn weakened but held
the show. SCREENPLAY raced in the second flight from between horses, held position to the final turn then made a rail bid and was up for the show.
SMOKING GUN was in the second flight from the three path to the final turn and finished evenly. NATE'S REVENGE saved ground to no avail. TAYLOR'S
SENSE trailed to the final turn then made a mild bid and hung.

Footnotes
GOLDEN QUALITY broke out slightly, then hustled to a challenged lead through the final turn, shook loose in upper stretch and drew off. VALIANT
DEFENDER was allowed to settle through the final turn then went between horses in mid stretch for a late rally. MATH MAN raced near the back through
the first turn then steadily advance down the backstretch, went between horses on the final turn and missed the place. COUNTRY CUT was checked early
while saving ground from off the pace made a mild bid at the end of the bend and finished evenly. HESACALENDARBOY pressed the pace through the final
turn and lacked a late response. ONE HITTER was unhurried and was never a threat. NUGGET OF GRACE went five wide into the first turn then stalked
the pace but was never a factor. CALLEN FEELS GOOD was forwardly placed to the final turn and gave way.

Footnotes
LOVETHATCAUSE tracked the leader from the two path to the final turn then engaged the leader to take the lead in upper stretch and held off the inside
closer for the win. DOUBLE BARREL MAN was close up on the inside through the final turn then made a rail bid on the leaders and dueled to the wire to
just miss the win. STEPHEN'S ANSWER saved ground while racing in the middle of the pack to the final turn then made a two to three wide bid in the
stretch to be up for the show. BAJAN CASH raced back to the final turn then made a three wide bid on the turn, moved out to four wide in upper stretch and
closed well. BIBLEMAN sprinted to a clear lead to upper stretch, was engaged at the eighth pole and dueled to the sixteenth pole and weakened.
GENTRIFIED was not a threat. HULEN was off slow, was rushed to contention going into the first turn then made a three wide bid on the backstretch and
tired.
