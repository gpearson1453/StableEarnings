Footnotes
ARABIAN KNIGHT bumped an outer rival while spurting away from the gates, set the pace along the inside as a pair of outer foes gave chase, then
powered away when let out in upper stretch, widened under mild hand urging through midstretch, and was wrapped up in the closing stages.
DETERMINEDLY tracked from midpack, tucked down to the two path entering the turn, pursued behind the main group, slipped inside of foes entering the
lane to claim place while the leader kicked away, and was second best. EXPECT MORE walked out of the starting gates and spotted the rest of the group
many lengths, lagged behind down the backstretch, quickly rejoined the field leaving the three furlong pole, swung six wide turning for home before drifting
to the nine path entering the lane, and stayed on for show. DAKOTA RUN rushed forward to an inside stalking position, tipped outside of the clear leader
entering the lane, but quickly failed to keep pace while getting outkicked by an inner foe for place in upper stretch, and yielded. ENCENDIDO leaned in and
bumped a sharply breaking foe at the start, raced far back three wide, then shifted inwardly in upper stretch, and improved along the rail. ROCKET AND
ROLL bumped with an inner rival at the start, was taken in hand when mildly crowded between horses leaving the chute, checked at the eleven sixteenths
pole, recovered to track in the four path, shifted five wide entering the lane, but lacked a kick and faded. FASHION KING pressed two wide and between
horses, but faded while floated three wide entering the lane. GLEN AIRY bumped with an outer rival at the start, saved ground off of the pace, but to no
avail. AERATOR laid off of the pace two wide, then from between horses around the turn, and made little impact. CERTAIN pressed three wide, but
weakened four wide and between horses entering the lane. LINE TO GAIN raced in midpack two wide, but faded between horses after a quarter pole, and
folded.

lane, rallied down the lane and was gaining in the late stages. FORTIN HILL pressed the pace early two wide, raced three wide along the turn, was in the
three path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. NIGHT TIME was put in tight and was checked back shortly after leaving the gate, raced in the
two path along the turn, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but flattened out late in the drive. GUN IT chased the pace early, raced
three wide along the turn, was in the six path into the lane and leveled off late in the stretch drive. NO SHIRT NO SHOES tracked the pace early, raced in
the four path along the turn, was in the five path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch. LOFTY ADJUDICATOR was never a factor. ROBO MAN

Footnotes
GOODNIGHT OLIVE attended the pace between horses, moved up readily through the turn, struck the front entering the stretch, shook clear and widened.
ECHO ZULU settled in hand, looped up five wide through the turn, loomed large entering the stretch, was unable to reach the winner but held her
stablemate at bay for the runner up spot. WICKED HALO tucked in leaving the chute, moved up along the inside, shifted out entering the stretch, continued
on willingly but settled for the minor award. CE CE was allowed to settle, circled five wide and improved position. OBLIGATORY dropped well back leaving
the chute, settled off of the inside, wheeled out six wide leaving the turn, was fanned deeper still when CHI TOWN LADY came out, but boxed on fairly well
through the lane. CHI TOWN LADY came away a step slow, settled well back, swung wide entering the stretch and finished with a belated improvement.
EDGEWAY vied for the lead outside through the turn, but weakened entering the lane and gave way. LADY ROCKET was forwardly placed between rivals
for a half and faltered. STERLING SILVER lacked a response when asked. CHAIN OF LOVE (JPN) failed to make headway. FRANK'S ROCKETTE was
hustled along the second flight but was never a factor. SLAMMED disputed the pace along the inside to the stretch and caved.

Footnotes
CARAVEL tucked and crossed across inner foes' paths while clearing early on causing tight quarters for a few, set the pace along the inside as a pair of
foes pressed around the turn, shook clear while shifting a bit off of the rail in upper stretch, met EMARAATY ANA (GB)'s bid at the furlong ground, and
tenaciously fended that foe off through the late stages. EMARAATY ANA (GB) took a mild brush from a outer foe approaching the nine sixteenths pole,
stalked comfortably along the inside while pursuing behind the leader, produced a rail bid after that foe vacated it in upper stretch, dueled while not quite
reaching even terms with his outer counterpart through the final furlong, got fended off, and saved place late. CREATIVE FORCE (IRE) saved ground off of
the pace, swung six wide in upper stretch, and offered a good kick while hanging on his left lead, rallied to bear down on the top pair nearing the wire, but
missed reaching place. HIGHFIELD PRINCESS (FR) bumped an inner foe in the early stages, raced forwardly two wide and between horses, tipped four
wide entering the lane, grinded away to bid for show entering the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by an outer rival soon after. ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS
pressed four to three wide into the turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, and sustained his chase among foes while hanging on his
left lead. FLOTUS (IRE) tracked along the inside, chased in the three path in upper stretch, but checked behind traffic leaving midstretch. CAMPANELLE
(IRE) broke out and bumped an outer foe at the start, then was jostled in tight quarters between horses causing him to steady at the five furlong pole, raced
off of the pace two wide and between horses, but checked again in trouble at the three furlong pole, came into the lane in the five path, and moved up.
ARREST ME RED pressed three to two wide and between horses approaching the turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, and gave
way. CASA CREED rated far back along the inside, and failed to factor while slowly closing in. GOLDEN PAL began to shuffle about just before the gates
opened, then came out over a length slow while hopping slightly, recovered to a three wide tracking position, got floated five wide entering the lane, but
lacked a rally, and weakened. CAZADERO trailed two wide, and was outrun. GO BEARS GO (IRE) took a bump from an inner foe at the start, then as
bumped and put to tight quarters among foes in the early stages, settled off of the pace three wide, swung seven wide entering the lane, and made little
impact. OCEANIC raced far back while hung five wide, and never got inolved. NAVAL CROWN (GB) laid off of the pace four wide, and faded.

CODY'S WISH was a tad slow at the break and reserved early on, raced in the four path along the far turn, was in the five path entering the lane, rallied in
the upper stretch, ranged up on foe under a long drive and edged past that foe in the final stages. CYBERKNIFE chased the pace early, raced in the three
path along the far turn, edged ahead near the eighth pole while coming in on foe, inched clear a bit but was collared and put under a long drive in the final
furlong and was caught at the wire. SLOW DOWN ANDY tracked the pace early on while near the rail, raced in the two path along the far turn, shifted into
the four path entering the lane, made a bid down the lane but leveled off late in the drive. GUNITE stalked the pace early on, raced in the two path through
the far turn, made a bid in the upper stretch, was bothered and steadied near the eighth pole and weakened late in the drive. LAW PROFESSOR raced
back early on, was in the three path along the far turn, swung into the six path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. THREE TECHNIQUE was
unhurried early on, raced in the three path along the far turn, was in the six path entering the lane and improved position down the lane. SIMPLIFICATION
was bumped at the start then put in tight early on before the first turn, chased the pace for a half and was empty in the stretch drive. SENOR BUSCADOR
raced in the four path along the far turn, fanned into the seven path into the lane and was never a factor. PIPELINE was bumped at the start, set the pace
from the outset and gave way from the rail along the far turn. ALONG WITH A STEWARDS INQUIRY, THE RIDER OF SLOW DOWN ANDY CLAIMED AN
OBJECTION AGAINST CYBERKNIFE FOR INTERFERENCE BUT AFTER REVIEW BY THE STEWARDS THE CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED AND THERE
WAS NO ACTION TAKEN FROM THE INQUIRY.

Footnotes
TUESDAY (IRE) settled in hand off of the inside, crept to within striking distance through the second turn, came five wide into the stretch, quickened once
straightened for the drive, was full bore inside the furlong marker, caught IN ITALIAN (GB) inside the sixteenth marker and kicked away. IN ITALIAN (GB)
opened clear to dictate a cracking tempo, kept on doggedly but was unable to resist the winner in the final yards. LADY SPEIGHTSPEARE stalked the pace
inside, got through a loomed a danger entering the stretch, toiled on but settled for the minor award. NASHWA (GB) settled saving ground, shifted out and
advanced between rivals on the second turn, came five wide into the stretch and was making up ground too late. MOIRA was unhurried near the tail of the
field, wheeled out six wide entering the lane and improved position. MISE EN SCENE (GB) settled off of the inside, mounted a mild bid between rivals
entering the stretch but failed to sustain the drive. ABOVE THE CURVE was allowed to settle, finished with a belated gain but failed to threaten. VIRGINIA
JOY (GER) was unhurried, tucked in to save ground, but was never a factor. TOY (IRE) chased three wide, but faltered between foes leaving the second
turn and faded. FAMILY WAY contended three wide through the second turn and dropped out. ROUGIR (FR) failed to respond. GOING TO VEGAS saved
ground to little avail.

cleared the field late. C Z ROCKET chased the pace early, raced in the two path into the lane, inched clear near the eighth pole, was under a long drive to
inside the sixteenth pole but yielded in the late stages and held off rival for place. JACKIE'S WARRIOR stalked the pace early, fanned into the six path
entering the lane, made a three wide bid near the eighth pole but hung in the late stages. MANNY WAH was unhurried early on, raced on the inside along
the turn, made a bid up the inside in the stretch and finished willingly in the late stages. O BESOS trailed the field early on, was in the five path entering the
lane, rallied down the lane and was rolling in the final stages. SUPER OCHO (CHI) set a clear pace from the outset while in the five path, raced in the three
path along the turn, wandered back out to the five path entering the lane, was between horses near the eighth pole while being overtaken and faltered late
in the drive. KIMARI fanned into the seven path entering the lane with a belated gain late in the stretch run. AMERICAN THEOREM chased the pace early,
raced in the two path through the turn and leveled off late in the stretch drive. FLASH OF MISCHIEF was well placed early on, raced in the three path along
the turn, was in the seven path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. WILLY BOI turned his head at the start, chased the pace early, raced in
the four path along the turn, fanned into the eight path entering the lane and faded down the lane. ALOHA WEST was never involved.

Footnotes
MALATHAAT settled off of the inside, came under a ride nearing the three furlong marker, moved up four wide, came five wide, dug in under stern handling
and was fully extended to get up in the final jump. BLUE STRIPE (ARG) attended the pace along the inside, tipped out and advance between rivals, forged
a narrow lead four wide, fought on doggedly but was denied in the last bob. CLAIRIERE settled saving ground, moved off the inside and around a tiring rival
on the second turn, dropped back to the rail entering the stretch, slipped through and kicked on but wasn't quite good enough. NEST made an early move
five wide, came to near level terms entering the stretch, but wilted between foes in the drive and gave way. SECRET OATH made an early move between
horses, forged a narrow lead into the second turn, disputed the issue to the final furlong and faltered. SEARCH RESULTS prompted the pace three deep,
but came up empty between rivals on the second turn and retreated. SOCIETY opened clear to set the pace, was collared into the second turn, relinquished
the lead near the three furlong marker and gave way. AWAKE AT MIDNYTE contended between horses, was caught in tight near the seven-sixteenths pole,
checked hard and came up empty thereafter.

Footnotes
REBEL'S ROMANCE (IRE) laid unhurried in the two path, moved between horses nearing the second turn, gradually shifted four wide while among foes
around the far turn, fanned six wide entering the lane, then offered a good kick while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, swept past the leaders at the
furlong grounds and drove clear. STONE AGE (IRE) stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, led
briefly coming to the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer rival at that juncture, and kept on to secure place from chasing rivals on both sides.
WAR LIKE GODDESS tracked from midpack along the inside, rated back approaching the far turn, patiently awaited racing room around the far turn, then
split foes two wide in upper stretch while commencing a charge, rallied strong to split foes again at the furlong grounds after the leader kicked clear, bid for
place inside of STONE AGE (IRE) approaching the final sixteenth, but was fended off before saving show. MISHRIFF (IRE) broke slowly, raced far back two
wide, tipped three wide into the second turn, took the far turn four to five wide before getting floated seven wide entering the lane, then only offered a mild
kick while hanging on his left lead, stayed on while chasing the clearing leader, stayed on to bid for show in the late stages, but ran out of ground. NATIONS
PRIDE (IRE) bobbled at the start, laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, but got shuffled back behind a tiring foe turning for home, tipped three
wide entering the lane, and ran on. BROOME (IRE) broke a few lengths slow, saved ground off of the pace, shifted seven wide in upper stretch, and stayed
on. CHANNEL MAKER pressed two wide, vied into the final bend, battled between horses through upper stretch, but weakened at the furlong grounds.
MASTER PIECE (CHI) saved ground while tracking in midpack, but only managed to chase while lacking a bid. BYE BYE MELVIN set the pace inside of a
pressing rival, vied with that foe around the final bend, but was headed in upper stretch, and faltered at the furlong pole. GOLD PHOENIX (IRE) laid off of
the pace three wide, then yielded while getting floated five wide and between horses entering the lane. RED KNIGHT settled off of the pace four to three
wide, then faded four wide entering the lane. HIGHLAND CHIEF (IRE) tracked in midpack two wide, then weakened between horses around the far turn.
NAUTILUS (BRZ) checked between horses nearing the opening turn, raced at the rear three wide, and was outrun.

FLIGHTLINE pressed LIFE IS GOOD into the first turn, raced in the four path along the first turn and backed off down the backstretch into a stalking
position, began to pull away from the field with LIFE IS GOOD down the backstretch and in the far turn, made a bid nearing the lane, quickly took over
command once in the stretch, romped down the lane under brisk urging and was in hand during the final stages. OLYMPIAD raced in the three path along
the first turn while back early on, was in the five path into the lane and rallied down the lane for place in the late stages. TAIBA was unhurried racing along
the two path in the first turn, chased the leaders along the far turn, was in the four path entering the lane before lodging a bid for place down the lane but did
not have enough for that position in the final stages. RICH STRIKE was reserved early on, raced in the three path along the first turn, was carried out by
EPICENTER down the backstretch, moved to the rail and saved ground along the far turn and moved up in the stretch run. LIFE IS GOOD set the pace from
the outset, raced in the two path along the first turn, pulled away from the the field with FLIGHTLINE down the backstretch and the far turn, raced in the
three path entering the lane, was overtaken once in the stretch and gave way late in the drive. HOT ROD CHARLIE chased the pace early, was in the three
path into the lane and faded to the wire. HAPPY SAVER raced on the inside along the first turn and trailed the field while far back, was in the four path into
the lane and leveled off late in the stretch run. EPICENTER was pulled up midway through the backstretch and vanned off after the race. THE THREE
QUARTERS TIME WAS UPDATED AFTER VIDEO REVIEW.

Footnotes
WAKANAKA (IRE) was unhurried, settled saving ground, came under a ride on the second turn, wheeled out six wide entering the stretch, reeled in the
leaders and was inching away. HENRIETTA TOPHAM attended the pace inside, slipped through entering the stretch, kicked on well but was unable to resist
the winner. BURNING AMBITION was away alertly, set the pace toward the inside, drifted out a bit leaving the second turn, weakened slightly between foes
and settled for the minor award. STOLEN HOLIDAY was close up off of the inside, came four wide but flattened in the final furlong and gave way.
SHANTISARA (IRE) was allowed to settle, came five wide to make a mild bid, but failed to sustain the drive. DALIKA (GER) prompted the pace outside
through the second turn and tired.
