Footnotes
LITTLE SAMURAI raced in midpack while three wide early, was roused heading into the turn, shifted out to the seven path to make a bid in the final furlong,
and drew past an inner foe in the final sixteenth to get the win. MINDOFMYOWN had a slow start and chased from the six path, bid from the eight path at
the top of the lane, and kept on but was caught late to place. ALLIE'S PAL set the pace from the three path but yielded in the final furlong to show.
IMGOINOUTTONIGHT tracked between between rivals, had to steady going into the turn, was ridden from the six path into the stretch, but finished evenly.
ATHENA'S STORM stalked from two wide early but flattened down the lane. HEY ROXY trailed while in the four path early and was no factor.
ROBTHEQUEEN raced from wellback along the inside and never menaced. PEARL DRAGON was hustled along from inside but gaveway midway around
the turn. ADDED FRACTIONS AND CHANGED FINAL TIME FOLLOWING VIDEO REVIEW.

CREDIT CARD FRAUD prompted the pace from the four path, bid from the five path entering the lane, and drew clear in the final furlong. CYNICAL GIRL
rated from the five path early and kept on from the six path in the stretch to place. FAST AND FEVEROUS had a slow start and trailed early, moved up
outside of rivals around the turn, was driven from the eight path into the stretch, and ran on to get up for show. REAL ME led from the three path, was cued
from the four path entering the lane, but yielded inside the final sixteenth. SHAKE RAG raced from wellback in the four path, was driven from the eight path
into the stretch, and passed tired rivals late. DIAMOND ONTHE TOE tracked the pace in the three path but was no menace. OUR TEN ANGELS pressed
the pace from inside but backed up around the turn. DANIEL'S GIRL chased from the two path but was empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
MORO APPEAL was hustled along from the four path, took aim from the six path turning into the lane, and rallied to get up late. SEEULATERGATOR set
the pace in the three path, opened up from the five path going into the stretch, but ws caught in the closing stages to place. SHANGHAI MIKE chased
between rivals, was driven from the six path going into the stretch, but finished evenly. WILD FIREMAKER stalked from the two path early but faded in the
stretch. ZESTY JAZZMAN raced from wellback and three wide early, drifted out to the nine path going into the stretch, and was no factor. SALTIE FIRE
rated along the inside but was no threat. OKIE CITY was outrun early, eased in the stretch, and walked off. COYSTER reared and stumbled badly at the
start causing the rider to briefly lose his irons and was always behind. ADDED FRACTIONS AND CHANGED FINAL TIME FOLLOWING VIDEO REVIEW.
THERE WAS AN INQUIRY TO LOOK AT THE START FOR COYSTER BUT THERE WAS NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
DUBRONSKY rated in the four path, ranged up to take over around the far turn, opened up into the lane, and was much the best. FLAT FAST chased
between rivals, was roused and took aim from the six path going into the stretch, but was no match for the winner and held on to place. INQUISITEUR was
caught five wide around the first turn, tracked in the four path but evened out in the stretch to show. CHUCKIES CHANCE dueled for the lead from inside
but yielded late around the far turn. RUN FOR MATTY prompted the pace from three wide but gaveway entering the stretch. ESTEEMED broke out at the
start, raced from wellback in the center of the track and was no factor. DIGGER'S GOLD dropped out early and was never a threat. CLIFTON PARK was
always behind. ARIMONY stalked along the inside but was done going into the far turn. LEATHERNECK dueled while two wide but gaveway around the far
turn.
