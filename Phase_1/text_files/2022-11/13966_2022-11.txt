Footnotes
WART broke alertly then took back to track the quick early fractions, advanced nearing the quarter marker, overtook the pacesetter leaving the turn, took
command into the final furlong and pulled away late while drifting out in the final sixteenth. EL CAPRICHO settled off of the early pace while racing in
midpack, came three wide on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was no match for the winner in the final stages but kept on late to get the place. BIG
DIFFERENCE settled in the second flight, raced two wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and made a late rally in the final sixteenth to
secure the show. SEIGE THE DAY was allowed to settle, was never far back in the early going, saved ground to the top of the lane and did not mount a late
rally. A BIT MUCH was hustled to the early lead, showed good early speed, drew to a clear lead into the turn, set quick fractions to the quarter marker, was
overtaken by the winner in upper stretch and faded. OAKDALE ROAD bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, advanced on the turn while three wide
but was not able to factor in the stretch run. RUSSELL was a bit slow into early stride, lagged into the turn, was pulled up entering the turn and was vanned
off.

Footnotes
TRIBUTE TO AFLEET lunged at the start, recovered to be forwardly placed in the early stages, was well placed along the backstretch run, saved ground
into the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, responded to his firm urging in the final furlong, split foes nearing the sixteenth-marker and kept to task in deep
stretch to prevail. PICK BYMY FRIEND tracked the early pace from a three wide path, maintained position to the half-mile marker, advanced three wide on
the far turn, swung four wide into the drive, gained ground inside of the furlong marker, was outkicked by the winner in deep stretch and was up for place in
the final stages. KING ROB showed early speed and was close up to the pace into the first turn, attended to the decent fractions through the backstretch
run, advanced on the far turn, overtook the pacesetter in upper stretch, was set down for the drive, could not match strides with the top pair in the final
furlong and held safely at the end for show. COUSIN MARK was unhurried, saved all of the ground to the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and offered
a belated rally in the final sixteenth. ALEX'S DREAM was allowed to settle, came two wide into the backstretch run, trailed to the half-mile marker, swung
widest into the drive and offered a mild late rally. FANTASTIC DREAM settled along the rail early on, came two wide nearing the quarter marker and did not
mount a late rally. WHISPER AND WINK raced two wide while in the second flight, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not threaten in the final stages.
TIGERINTHETANK was hustled to the early lead, set solid fractions through the backstretch run, was confronted nearing the quarter marker, could not hold
off KING ROB in upper stretch, chased that one to mid-stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
THE PHARAOH'S GIRL showed speed leaving the break and established the early lead, set solid fractions through the turn, extended the lead in upper
stretch, held foes at bay in deep stretch and dug in in the final strides to prevail. TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL broke out at the start and was off a step slowly,
stalked the solid pace three wide on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch, closed fast in the final sixteenth, challenged the winner in deep stretch and was
up for place in the final strides. CAROLINA MIA took back off of the early pace and tracked the pacesetter, came two then three wide nearing the quarter
marker, lost ground to THE PHARAOH'S GIRL in upper stretch, re-rallied inside of the furlong marker but was held at bay by the game winner, was
outfinished for place in the final strides and was well clear of the rest for show. NORTHWEST FACTOR was bothered at the start by COWBOYS
DAUGHTER and was off a step slowly, tracked the quick fractions from an inside path, tipped out two wide for the drive and did not produce a late rally.
COWBOYS DAUGHTER lunged at the start, was off slowly and bothered the neighboring NORTHWEST FACTOR, lacked early speed, came four wide
along the turn and was not a late factor. TIP TOP GAL chased the solid early fractions, came three wide into the drive and did not threaten.

Footnotes
BELLEO'S FOREST was allowed to settle, was well placed while not far back through the backstretch run, saved ground to the second turn, angled three
wide into upper stretch, loomed nearing the furlong grounds, took command into the final furlong, felt mild late pressure from the runner-up and proved best
in the end. BIG ATTRACTION was a bit slow into stride early on, was allowed to settle through the backstretch run, came two wide into the far turn, swung
five wide into the drive, finished well in the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in the late stages and secured the runner-up spot. KURA broke alertly
and was prominent into the first turn, tracked the decent fractions then advanced to press the pace into the second turn, overtook the pacesetter leaving the
quarter marker, was confronted by the winner nearing the furlong grounds, was outfinished in deep stretch and was well clear in the end for show. INFINITE
LOVE raced outside of rivals while stalking the early pace, came four wide into the backstretch run, lost a bit of ground while three wide nearing the quarter
marker, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way. UNWHIRLED was forwardly placed, came three wide into the backstretch run, lost position nearing
the quarter marker and weakened. SWEET VENGEANCE showed early speed, cleared the field into the first turn and set the solid early fractions, was
prompted into the second turn, was overtaken in upper stretch and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
SMILIN EVIE bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, was unhurried in the opening stages, advanced two wide on the turn, angled four wide in upper
stretch, confronted AMANDA ROSE nearing the furlong marker, battled with that rival to the final sixteenth and made a determined late push to prevail.
AMANDA ROSE was allowed to settle early on, was roused two wide and advanced to challenge for the lead nearing the top of the lane, took command into
the drive, held a narrow advantage over the winner to deep stretch, was overtaken in the final stages and was second best. DADDYS NINA stalked the early
fractions, saved ground through the turn, angled out in upper stretch, did not impact the top pair in the final stages and passed tiring rivals to get up for
show. LADY PACIFIC tracked the pace to the turn, came three wide to the quarter pole, could not keep pace leaving the turn and weakened. EXQUISITE
LEGACY was prominent on the run to the turn, dropped back nearing the quarter marker while three then two wide, improved position in upper stretch and
lacked a late response. THE FUN BEGINS broke alertly and showed good early speed, set solid fractions while pressed through the turn, was confronted in
upper stretch, battled to the furlong grounds and faded. MARANDO PASS chased from towards the rear, raced outside of rivals on the turn, came four wide
into the drive and was not a late threat.

well handled through decent fractions through the backstretch run, extended the lead on the far turn, was kept to task in mid-stretch, could not hold off the

in the early going, saved ground to the far turn, rallied two wide in upper stretch, could not reel in the top pair in deep stretch and was up for show in the final
strides. SALTO DE TIGRE settled three wide off of the early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, was roused nearing the quarter marker,
swung five wide into the drive, rallied in the late stages and just missed for show. SUGAR BEETS came in tight entering the first turn, settled in the second
flight, saved ground to the second turn and did not mount a late rally. SHOTGUN EXPRESS (IRE) was forwardly placed, stalked the early fractions from a
two wide position, came three wide along the second turn, lost ground approaching the furlong pole and did not offer a late response. MR BOTANICALS
bobbled at the start and was away slowly, was unhurried through the opening stages, came three wide into the far turn, swung widest off of the turn, came

Footnotes
ZAZEN was forwardly placed early on and stalked the rapid pace through the turn, chased BOSSY MAMA to mid-stretch, made a late surge inside of the
sixteenth-marker, overtook the runner-up and was up in the final strides to prevail. BOSSY MAMA broke alertly, showed good early speed and set fast early
fractions, held ZAZEN at bay to mid-stretch, was asked for more in deep stretch, could not hold off the surging winner in the final stages and was well clear
of the rest for second. RUNAWAY PRINCESS tracked the quick early pace from the inside, could not keep pace with the top pair in the drive and held for
show in the late stages. MIRACLE IN MOTION broke in a tangle and was off slowly, lacked speed through the turn, came four wide into the drive, was
gaining inside of the furlong marker and challenged for show. ST. ANNIE'S INDY chased the quick pace from the inside and did not offer a late rally. HALF
HOPING chased three wide through the turn and was not a factor. LION'S LAIR chased the quick pace two wide to the quarter marker and tired.

Footnotes
OUR SHINING LIGHT (IRE) broke alertly and showed good early speed, was well rated while carving out decent fractions to the half-mile marker, turned
away a pressing rival leaving the second turn, drew clear to mid-stretch and was ridden out in the final stages as much the best. TUSKEGEE CAT stalked
the solid early fractions from the inside, maintained position to the half-mile pole, kept a rail path to the quarter marker, could not match strides with OUR
SHINING LIGHT nearing mid-stretch, was no match for the winner in the final stages and was second best in the end. SUPERMAZEL was fractious in the
gate, took back off of the early pace and came three wide into the backstretch run, improved position approaching the far turn, made a quick move three
wide nearing the quarter pole, swung five wide into the drive, could not keep pace with the top pair in the lane and held for show in the final strides.
NATIONAL GENERAUX (IRE) lost his path at the start and was off slowly, was allowed to settle, maintained position through the backstretch run, advanced
two wide on the far turn, could not sustain that rally in the stretch, finished evenly in the final sixteenth and just missed for show in the final strides.
VINNIEBOB showed early speed, stalked the decent fractions through the backstretch run, challenged OUR SHINING LIGHT nearing the quarter marker
and was repelled in that effort, chased the winner to mid-stretch and weakened. SHANAGOLDEN saved ground while settling off of the early pace, lost
position along the backstretch run, came in tight midway through the second turn and dropped back nearing the quarter marker, recovered in upper stretch
and passed tiring foes in the late stages. RACKATAPTAP hopped at the start then was shuffled back at the break and was away slowly, was allowed to
settle, steadied off of heels into the backstretch run, was unhurried to the second turn, came four then five wide into the stretch run and was not a factor.
ARTISTIC SERVE stalked the decent early fractions, maintained position through the backstretch run, lost ground three wide on the second turn and tired in
the stretch.

LUXURY LINER showed early speed and prompted the fast early fractions, kept close attendance to the pacesetter to the quarter pole, overtook ICONIC
SKY in upper stretch, held that one at bay to the furlong marker, kept to task in the final sixteenth and determinedly held in the final strides to prevail.
SHEZA GIRLY GIRL took back off of the fast early pace, was steered three wide along the turn, gained ground nearing mid-stretch, closed fast while
navigating traffic in deep stretch, could not reel in the winner in the final strides and just got up on the wire for place. LADY'S SERMON was forwardly
placed in the early going, lost a bit of ground while three wide on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch, ran evenly to the furlong grounds, closed in
deep stretch, was outfinished in the final strides and just missed for place. BLUE WILDCAT tracked the quick early pace, raced two wide between rivals on
the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, gained ground in the final sixteenth but was outkicked. ALWAYS SEEKING lacked early speed and settled toward the
rear in the early going, raced two wide on the turn, mounted a three wide rally inside of the furlong marker, made a bold late move but was unable to reel in
the leaders in the final strides. MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN chased from the second flight, came two wide to the quarter marker, shifted out nearing mid-stretch
and finished well in the late stages. ICONIC SKY was hard sent after a good beginning and set fast early fractions, was pressed to the quarter marker by
LUXURY LINER, was confronted by that rival in upper stretch, met that bid to the furlong grounds and weakened. WORTHY OF MAGIC stalked the fast
early pace from the second flight, saved ground to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and gave way. TWILIGHT EMPIRE chased from the rear,
came five wide into the drive and found her best stride late. ASHLEY'S RAINBOW was allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, made a late gain in
the final furlong but did not threaten in the end. ALTHEA GIBSON chased the fast early fractions from the inside, advanced on the turn, could not sustain
that run in the stretch, weakened in the final furlong and was reported to have bled when pulled up.

Footnotes
LOVE CANDY broke out a bit at the start but recovered quickly and took the rail path behind the pacesetters, maintained that position while patiently
awaiting racing room through the far turn, got a dream run through a hole on the rail turning for home and drew off as the rider pleased.
ROCKTILLYOUDROP lagged behind after the break and lost contact with the field around the first turn, began to rally heading into the far turn but was still
last passing the three-sixteenths pole, angled to the inside for room and found his best stride late to gain the place. COOLCROSS hustled from the outside
and managed to angle over to the three-path into the first turn, was close up while seemingly comfortable with the pace still in the three-path to the far turn,
was sent after the leaders passing the three-furlong pole, entered the stretch four-wide and managed a grinding finish to get the show. OH GREAT (IRE)
gained good position into the first turn and was content to stalk LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH to the far turn, began a challenge from the three-furlong marker,
gained a brief lead in mid-stretch but did not have anything left to fend off the closers. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) was three-wide into the first turn and
five-wide down he backside and into the far turn, did not respond when asked while racing between horses, was fanned five wide turning for home and once
in the clear showed some late interest with a mild rally. DEALERS HAND broke alertly but was content to let others take command, rated mid-pack while
under a tight hold for the first half mile, was in traffic through the far turn, had a clear path turning for home but lacked the needed response to make an
impact. SYNC was outrun early but saved ground, made some forward progress down the backstretch run while tugging on the rider, appeared to have
some run but was boxed in for the whole of the far turn and behind horses the length of the stretch. LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH hesitated for a beat at the start
but was quickly into stride and easily gained the rail and the lead on the first turn, led the field down the backstretch while being rated, responded when
asked to pick up the pace passing the seven-sixteenths pole, was challenged by OH GREAT (IRE) at the top of the stretch, engaged in a spirited duel but
tired in the final eighth of a mile. PEPPERMAN lagged near the rear of the field for the first half-mile and was unable to make any impact thereafter.
WALKING BOSS lacked any early speed, entered the first turn in the three-path and exited in the six-path, remained wide to the far turn, launched a bid with
a half-mile to go and did no respond despite encouragement from the rider.
