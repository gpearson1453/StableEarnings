Footnotes
JUBA BABY set a pressured pace, rounded the turn near the rail and was kept alert in the stretch. BLUE MOUNTAIN pressured the pace, raced off the rail
on the turn and settled for second. FAR MORE chased through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn and finished evenly to take third approaching
mid-stretch. LADY GANGSTER chased, rounded the turn about the three path and showed little in the lane. TAPTAP gave chase, raced in the three path of
the turn and proved empty in the lane. LITTLE O LITTLE E pressured the pace through the backstretch then faded at the rail on the turn. BANK CARD came
away rank and was roughed while ducking inward from the gate, loped along early then urged the final quarter. The Stewards reviewed the start of this race.

Footnotes
GOLDEN APPEAL settled off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead two deep past the quarter and was steadily
handled to just last. MARK DID IT became a bit anxious in the gate then saved ground on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn off the rail, drifted into the stretch but dug in under steady encouragement and just missed. DIVINING DANCER settled in the three path the first turn,
left the turn outside and bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn two deep then dueled through the stretch for third. INGREIDO saved ground
racing well off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the four path, dug in from the head of the lane and finished well.
SNOW CANDY took over at the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, but was
caught at the rail past the quarter and weakened. AKINGISALWAYSKING settled off the pace about the three path, picked up the chase from the half mile
pole then faded at the rail on the far turn. POLITICAL DECISION stalked inside on the first turn then faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
LUCKY BLONDE took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, dug in to the challenge of AMELIA'S DREAM leaving the half mile pole and contested the
edge at the rail on the far turn, was met approaching the head of the lane but recovered the advantage just inside the eighth pole and dug in determinedly to
inch clear later yards, while the latter, tapered in to stalk the early pace from the three and four paths, challenged past the half mile pole and contested at a
close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, took a brief slim lead toward the head of the lane, was met inside the eighth pole but dug in gamely to late
stretch before reluctantly ceding. BEST VIRGINIA rated close inside on the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on
the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. NO DENYING DENIS settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded
the far turn off the rail then flattened in the lane. ISLE BE THERE saved ground racing well back on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, angled
to the outside approaching the top of the lane and passed rivals outside. SPARKLEINYOUREYE rounded the first turn about the five path, gave chase from
the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. LET'S DO THIS tapered in and stalked off the rail the first turn,
gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole then faded off the rail on the far turn. JUNIPER GRACE was slow into stride and never factored. WISHING
FOR SPRING showed little response.

Footnotes
TENNIS TAP stalked in the three path the first turn then took the lead three wide at the seven sixteenths pole, came under pressure toward the three
eighths, widened at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. MAY MAYS CASTLE rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase nearing
the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn but was no match in the lane. HOOK THE CHAIN settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up
the chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. MY SISTER PAM rounded
the opening turn in the four path then stalked into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole but flattened in the three path of the far turn.
GOLD PHOENIX took a brief lead into the first turn and raced at mostly even terms through the turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but
weakened toward the quarter. DIVA GAL raced with the early pace but gave way approaching the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
TRUSTYOURINSTINCT settled close on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn five wide, then dug in from the
head of the lane to take over later yards. SUBJECT TO CHANGE stalked into the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole and took the lead
between horses approaching the quarter, dug in gamely from the head of the lane but reluctantly ceded in later yards. MORE PLEASE rounded the first turn
in the three path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn then outfinished in the duel through the stretch.
CHARLIE POTATOES saved ground well off the pace on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and improved in the four path of
the far turn, left the turn outside and finished well. CLOSE THE CASE rounded the first turn about the four path, left the turn outside and gave chase from
the three eighths pole, saved ground on the far turn and ran evenly down the lane. HEARTNESS rounded the first turn in the four path then stalked into the
backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced four wide on the far turn then flattened from mid-stretch. JUNGLE WARRIOR showed little
response. WICKED MAD took the lead two deep into the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, was caught
nearing the quarter, continued close at the rail on the far turn then weakened the final sixteenth. ACASHA'S INTUITION was not a factor.

Footnotes
MAD GENIUS was shuffled back at the start and rounded the first turn in the five path, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four and five
paths of the far turn, dug in for the lead inside the sixteenth pole and held on well with steady handling. EISELE rounded the first turn in the four path, picked
up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole and ran at the rail on the far turn, came between horses mid-stretch but was outfinished through later yards.
GIVE IT A GO settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, eased
outward into the lane then outfinished in the duel through the stretch. LIL MR MATT stalked off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and took a slim lead two deep midway on the far turn, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the turn but was met inside the sixteenth
pole and relented later yards. OBANNON rated a short lead inside, came under pressure toward the seven sixteenths pole but was met at the rail midway
on the far turn, then weakened nearing mid-stretch. CHAMPAGNE JAM saved ground. NEW SOUTH stalked the early pace about the three path, gave
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn. HENRY STANDINGBEAR showed little response.
