Footnotes
TOUGH WORKOUT lunged at the start but recovered quickly, controlled the pace, repelled a challenge in early stretch and pulled away. EXCLUSIVE
ORDER made a menacing four wide move after half a mile, was repelled in the stretch while easily second best. DUBROVNIK settled three wide close up,
moved closer before the half then faded. FACTUM LOVE STYLE advanced wide near the three eighths pole then faltered. SOCIAL JOE trailed early,
moved extremely wide into the stretch and was no factor. OLD BEAU prompted the pace inside for half a mile and gave way. PRINCIPE rated just off the
leaders outside then stopped abruptly. KANE saved ground and faded steadily losing contact with his field.

PEARLS AND HEELS rated early, went after the leader before half a mile then drew away through the stretch under moderate urging. PLIANTLEA lagged
far behind inside then closed well late to gain the place. MISQUILLO dropped far behind then advanced very wide with late energy. DIANE'S COMET raced
close up outside then proved empty in the stretch. CLASSY MISS raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter early then stopped. MUSAMAHA hustled to a
clear advantage to midway on the final turn and faded. CORBALLY broke slowly and ducked out sharply at the break then gave way.

Footnotes
GENGHIS pressed the pace racing close up outside, bid on the turn, took over at the quarter pole, drew clear and held well under urging. MAGNETRON
raced off the pace, advanced inside on the turn, angled out for the drive, rallied outside and dug in gamely to the finish. CROATIAN raced two wide off the
pace, chased on the turn and rallied mildly inside for third. AHSAD chased on the inside, chased on the turn, lacked a bid and finished evenly. CURLIN'S
THRILL raced off the rail, off the pace, came wide into the stretch and closed belatedly outside. HIGH VELOCITY set the pace on the inside, showed the
way on the turn, dueled into the stretch and weakened late. THE RIGHT PATH raced off the pace inside and was outrun.

IN EQUALITY well placed outside the dueling leaders, bid to the front in midstretch and edged away through the final furlong. CLUBMAN advanced inside
after half a mile, hooked the winner then proved second best. LONG GRAY LINE trailed far behind then narrowed gap while no threat. FRENCH TOAST
dueled outside for three quarters and faltered. SAMARONTI saved ground off the pace and lacked a response. GRAZELY urged to narrow lead inside then
stopped into the far turn. RELATIVLEA dropped back, angled inside on the final turn and was no factor. JUST NOD AND SMILE chased very wide down the
backstretch and was outrun. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY flashed speed outside then gave way readily. AMERICAN ROMA settled just behind the
pacesetters and faltered. NOBIZ LIKE JETBIZ stopped abruptly after half a mile. VERRAZANO BRIDGE suffered an injury to his left front on the final turn,
was eased and vanned off.

turned back a bid from RUNNINGFORHOME and edged away late. RUNNINGFORHOME raced three wide early, then stalked between rivals, chased three

outfinished. WILD UNION trackde close up on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and tired. ROYAL COUP was fractious in the gate, broke a step slow,
raced off the pace, moved up between rivals on the far turn, then tired. MONDAY'S WITH MIKE raced four wide early, stalked three wide and gave way on

IMAGINE THIS urged outside down the backstretch, advanced very wide in the stretch then offered a late surge and pulled clear. BATTLE OF BERLIN
made a menacing three wide bid at the quarter pole, led in the stretch but was outfinished. ENFORCER dueled outside, led narrowly at the quarter pole then
weakened. JOKEMEISTER vied inside rivals to the stretch then faltered. LATE TO THE SHOW settled well off the pace, moved inside on the turn and
lacked a bid. CONNECTING raced close up inside the dueling leaders then flattened out in the stretch. SOUL PROVIDER dropped back early and trailed
throughout.

GUILLAUME vied two wide for the early lead, dueled outside of GOOD CULTURE on the backside and far turn, battled heads apart with that rival through
the stretch run and prevailed late. GOOD CULTURE vied inside for the lead, dueled on the backside and far turn, battled heads apart with GUILLAUME into
the stretch, dug in gamely inside of that rival and fought on determinedly to the end. MASKED MARAUDER raced four wide early, stalked outside a rival,
chased the leaders on the far turn, lacked a winning bid and bested the others for the show spot. DEEP FAITH tracked on the inside, chased inside on the
far turn and weakened. DOCTOR DOOM raced off the pace inside and did not factor. VIKRAM raced four wide early and was outrun.

RUBY BLEU hustled to a clear advantage, widened in the stretch, continued to dominate his field and was geared down late. SUPER DUDE chased wide
and continued willingly to gain the place. VISUAL ARTIST chased the winner close up outside then flattened out in the stretch. FROSTED INDIAN was
urged just off the pacesetter inside then weakened in the stretch. OLYMPIC ROMP lagged far behind then caught a fading rival late. MY FRIENDS BEER
