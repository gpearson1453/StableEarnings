INDYBOUND stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, hit the front leaving the furlong marker and held on gamely to prove best,
driving. DUCKPINS tracked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn, then continued that bid but was outfinished by the winner, good effort.
LANDON JACK was away alertly to set the pace from the inside, then was headed nearing the furlong marker and weakened, bested rest. PRIDE OF
PAYTON was settled three to four wide on the turn, came six wide into the lane and had no rally. SUPER ACCELERATE tracked the early pace on the
inside and eased off the inside on the turn and came three wide into the lane and was empty. SNEAKING SUSPICION was reserved early and failed to

YES SIR ROBERT stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid when ready on the turn to take over, then drew clear and remained clear to the wire to
prove best, driving. PARADISE PRIDE was reserved early and saved ground throughout, finished well on the inside to be clearly second best. ASSEMBLY
POINT (BRZ) was allowed to settle early on the inside, made a four wide move on the turn to move into contention but flattened out, bested rest. ERAWAN
was settled back early, five wide on the turn and passed the tiring rivals. FRIENDLY FELLA chased the pace three wide and weakened. HELMS DEEP set
the pace on the inside and gave way. AND WON failed to menace.

Footnotes
ROCK ROSE was well rated early, made a four wide sweep on the turn to take over, then drew clear and was ket to left handed crop urging to prove much
the best. MARTHARITA was allowed to settle early on the inside, eased off the inside and swung out four wide for the drive, finished evenly late to be
clearly second best. POLISH COOKIE was reserved early, three wide on the turn and came five wide into the lane, then got up late for the show award.
QUEEN CADENCE set the early pace and then dueled for the lead on the inside on the turn and weakened, lost show award late. FISHERS passed the
tiring rivals. AMERICAS WOMAN failed to menace. CAUSE TO DREAM pressed the pace three wide and made a two wide bid on the turn to duel for
command and then weakened.
