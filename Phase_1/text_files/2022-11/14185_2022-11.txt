Footnotes
COUNTERFEIT stalked along the inside, chased the clear leader while gaining place nearing the furlong pole, took aim on that tiring foe in the final
sixteenth, bid in the closing stages, and edged away late. THE THREE KS sped clear, showed the way before inching a larger margin entering the lane,
maintained a clear advantage through midstretch while hanging on his left lead, but tired in the final sixteenth, and was worn down in the closing stages.
ARGYBARGY BUCK chased from midpack while taking the turn in the three path then gradually grinded away outside of foes in the final furlong, and
reached show late. ARCTIC ROSE stalked two wide, chased as the leader's closest pursuer around the turn, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, and
yielded. BAND BOSS lacked speed two wide, then shifted out to be outside of foes in upper stretch, but made little impact while hanging on his left lead.
CIROC O CLOCK trailed in the two to three paths around the turn, and failed to factor. MISS JENNY'S HALO was outrun along the inside.

CAP ROCK MINER set a clear pace in the three path, came into the lane in the four path, and held sway from an inner bidder. SERMONONTHEMOUNT
stalked along the inside, bid inside of the leader in midstretch, but was kept at bay. MISHKO stalked in the three path, then chased on his left lead. EAST
LEX laid off of the pace in the two path and failed to menace. HOT STOVE LEAGUE tracked from midpack along the inside, but only managed to chase
through midstretch before yielding in the final furlong. THE GREEN MO'STER tracked in the four path, and faded. WOMAN WITH A BOOK showed little.

Footnotes
HARD FOUR broke a step slow while bumping with an inner rival at the start, tracked four wide before moving forward to stalk the top pair entering the turn,
loomed a danger turning for home before bidding outside of RELIC HUNTER entering the lane, then wrestled an advantage in upper stretch, and held firm
from his inner game counterpart. RELIC HUNTER vied for the lead inside of another foe, led narrowly around the turn, disposed of that rival while digging in
to resist HARD FOUR's bid entering the lane, got headed in upper stretch, yet fought on doggedly through the final furlong. OUR HEATSEEKER broke a
step slow and bumped an outer rival at the start, lacked speed while taking the turn in the four path, then stayed on outside of rivals in midstretch to reach
show entering the final sixteenth. LIL WOADIE chased from midpack three wide, gained show at the furlong grounds while hanging on her left lead, but was
bested by an outer foe for that position soon after. BIG BOO laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted four wide and between horses coming to
midstretch, but lacked a bid. GO BROTHER GO chased along the inside, then lacked a punch while hanging on his left lead. RENATI vied for the lead two
wide, but weakened between horses entering the lane, and wilted on his left lead. BASTI BLUE broke a beat slowly, and was outrun.

Footnotes
DUST EM stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path around the first turn, moved to press after a half mile, sparred with an inner TREASURY
around the far turn, determinedly sustained the long duel through the final furlong, and prevailed. TREASURY set the pace in the two path, vied with an
outer rival around the far turn, dug in gamely to cling to a margin through midstretch, but succumbed in the long battle late. RISING EMPIRE tracked in
midpack in the three path, chased the top pair while claiming show around the far turn, then secured that position in midstretch while not threatening the
leaders. BURNING BRIGHT laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out five wide in upper stretch, and stayed on. UNINVITED GUEST bumped with an
outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside while a bit off of the rail, attempted a show bid inside of RISING EMPIRE in upper stretch, but faltered.
SEDUCTIVE U S A lacked speed along the inside, took the far turn in the three to four path, and passed tired rivals. JACK A ROSE stalked in the three path
while between a pair of foes entering the backstretch, but failed to sustain position after a half mile, and faded while floated to the five path around the far
turn. NEW YEAR SURPRISE laid off of the pace in the three path, and gave way. JOB SECURITY never got involved. RUNAWAY HARRY bumped with an
inner rival at the start, stalked along the inside, but wilted entering the far turn. FREEDOM FACTOR got outrun.

AND FIFTY was a bit restless awaiting the start, set the pace with her ears pricked entering the backstretch, showed the way in hand around the far turn,
then responded readily when set down entering the lane, kicked away passing the quarter pole, the began to tire in the closing stages, but lasted from a pair
of chasers late. SUNDAY BREEZE laid off of the pace in the three path, smartly tucked turning for home to split foes in the two path nearing the lane,
emerged from between horses to claim place leaving the quarter pole, yet failed to progress on the clear leader in upper stretch, dug in for place inside of
RUNINGINTHEMONEY a sixteenth from home, and gamely held while inching closer to the leader. RUNNINGINTHEMONEY tracked three to four wide,
chased around the far turn before fanning five wide entering the lane, yet ran on to bid for place entering the final sixteenth, sparred with an inner rival for
that position through the late stages, but was denied. AUTUMNS STRONG MAN stalked in the three path, floated four wide entering the lane, then yielded
between horses in midstretch. MO CREDO tracked in the two path, attempted to moved between horses at the five furlong pole, but was scrubbed upon
entering the far turn while failing to sustain that position, and lacked a response. ITS WILD AGAIN was fractious in the starting gate, then saved ground
towards the rear, but to no avail. COMMANDER SCOTT stalked along the inside while tugging under a snug hold around the first turn, took aim outside of
the leader turning for home, but was outkicked while floated three wide entering the lane, and caved between horses at the quarter pole.

RUNNING LATE tracked three wide, bid for the lead turning for home, gained an advantage in upper stretch, and kicked away at the furlong grounds.
NOTION stalked in the three path early on, decidedly tucked to the rail and inside of the clear leader with nine sixteenths to go, slipped through and bid at
the five sixteenths pole as an outer rival did the same, vied entering the lane, but was outkicked by that foe in upper stretch, and kept on to prove second
best. GEM COLLECTION set the pace while intentionally remaining a bit off of the inner rail, but got headed by rivals on both sides nearing the lane, and
gave way in midstretch. MOTOWN MISSILE laid off of the pace in the four path, then improved two wide and between horses turning for home before
drifting out in upper stretcch. MEANT TO BE LUCKY stalked along the inside, but failed to sustain that position down the backstretch, and faded around the
far turn. TIZZY TANTRUM stumbled at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, then faded in the four path around the far turn. BERNUCCI bobbled
inwardly at the start, then saved ground at the rear, but to no avail.

Footnotes
GOLDEN PALACE tracked in midpack in the four path, came into the lane in the five path, grinded away while shifting out to the eight path in midstretch to
remain outside of the leader, then drove past that foe at the sixteenth pole, and drew clear. COFFEE COUNTY settled far back two wide, shifted to the five
path in upper stretch, then stayed on, rallied between horses in the closing stages, and narrowly reached place at the wire. GOLD PUNCH cleared off early
on, opened up while remaining in the four path around the turn, drifted out slightly while tiring coming to the furlong grounds, then got outkicked by an outer
rival entering the final sixteenth, vied for place thereafter, but got outfinished by an inner foe. DUVEE stalked along the inside, chased the tiring leader
through midstretch, bid at the sixteenth pole, but failed to keep pace with an outer bidder leaving that juncture, vied for place thereafter, but also got
outfinished. GEORGE ALLEN stalked two wide, chased through upper stretch, attempted a mild bid among foes in the final furlong, but faltered in the
closing stages. CUSTOM BOBBY'S was urged along off of the pace along the inside, and failed to menace. EDDIE'S HUMOR was outrun. DUE TO A
TIMER MALFUNCTION; ALL FRACTIONS, EXCEPT THE FINAL TIME, ARE HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
SURVEILLANCE tracked two wide and between horses, inched closer outside of the leading pair while in the four path, then sustained a rally to drive past
the leaders at the sixteenth pole, and edged clear. HEART RHYTHM stalked along the inside, patiently bided time around the turn, then committed to a rail
charge in upper stretch, ranged up to the leader entering the final furlong to bid nearing the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by an outer on-charging foe at
that juncture, and proved second best. CHATTALOT set the pace in the two path, held sway through upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, but was
outkicked by rivals on either side entering the final sixteenth, gave way, yet saved show. CARRIBEAN CAPER pressed two wide while in the three path
around the turn, chased from between horses entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival at the furlong grounds, and kept on, but missed reaching
show. READY TO POUNCE saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. LONG WEEKEND lacked speed two wide, then failed to factor in the four path.
SIMPLY WICKED broke out, chased from midpack three wide, but faded around the turn.

Footnotes
PICKENS set the pace inside of a pressing rival, shook clear of that foe in the three path in upper stretch, then drifted outwardly through the final sixteenth
while holding sway. HOORAY AUSTIN laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch, and stayed on to reach place late.
G'WILDCAT stalked the top pair from the four path, then failed to progress in upper stretch, flopped back to his left lead while in the six path between horses
in midstretch, kept on to attempt a bid for place, but did not have enough. WISE ANCHOR took a bump from an outer rival at the start, vied for the lead
outside of the eventual winner while kept in the three to four paths by that foe, then failed to keep pace in upper stretch, and lost place to a pair of foes late.
SCHNELL hopped while breaking slowly, then tracked along the inside, chased through upper stretch, and yielded. BOOTSIE'S GALAXY laid speed in the
four path, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and made little impact. IZZY'S BABY BOY bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked from midpack in
the three path, but yielded between horses entering the lane. ZION got outrun.
