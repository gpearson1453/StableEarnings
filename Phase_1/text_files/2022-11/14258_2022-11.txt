Footnotes
MAJESTIC PHAROAH led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn, kicked clear in the lane and held that margin to the wire.
DEPOLI was bumped and squeezed back leaving the gate, trailed the field in the early going, began to move up while racing in the four path around the turn
and continued to gain ground on the outside in the stretch. GRATIA PRINCE tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge
while racing in the three path around the turn, dueled in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. PRINCE GHOST veered out leaving the gate,
settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and was outkicked from there. CESAR bumped with
the horse to his inside at the start, recovered to stalk the leader on the rail through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and faded
from there. COX CANYON raced off the pace on the on the inside early, quickly dropped back to trail the field, saved ground around the turn and showed
little.

Footnotes
SUPER CARO saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the rail coming around the far turn,
took over the lead entering the stretch and dug in to hold the victory. WATER FIGHT led the field from the three path around the first turn and up the
backstretch, dueled around the second bend, lost some ground while swinging wide entering the stretch, and dueled back to the wire to narrowly miss.
CHALCOLITHIC raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, angled in to save ground
around the second bend and improved position mildly to the wire. GINETTES ON FIRE raced in the three path in the early going, continued up the
backstretch in the middle of the pack, began a bid from the three path nearing the quarter pole and flattened out in late stretch. GENERAL ROBINSON
chased the frontrunner on the outside through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the three path and faded from there. MOVE TO ORDER
saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second bend and made no bid.
FULL TIME STRUTIN trailed the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground throughout and was never a factor.

Footnotes
EDEN PARADISE raced in the two path around the first turn settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, came around
the far turn in the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground outside to get up late. AWESOME STRIKE raced in the three
path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began a bid from the two path coming around the far turn,
bumped lightly with WICKED MOMENT entering the stretch, dueled down the lane and was caught. JOE BRAINS hopped up slightly leaving the gate,
recovered to lead the field on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the second bend and in upper
stretch and gave way in the final furlong. STREET GLIDE trailed the field on the outside through the opening half mile, raced in the two path around the turn
and gained ground late in the stretch. WICKED MOMENT raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
came around the far turn in the two path, bumped slightly with AWESOME STRIKE at the quarter pole and weakened from there. SOUTHERN CIVILITY
saved ground at the back of the pack through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the two path and passed tiring horses in the lane. KALINBA
saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and faded in the
stretch. LONG STORY raced off the pace in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, saved ground around the second bend and made no
bid.
