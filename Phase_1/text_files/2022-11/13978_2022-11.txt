strongly to be clear under steady handling. MUSICAL CAT was unhurried early on, made a four wide bid around the far turn and rallied well for the place
position while racing from the outside of rivals. FISHERS vied for the early lead while racing between rivals, dropped back a bit nearing the five sixteenths
pole, came on again from the inside and kept on to the wire. HOV LANE rated off the early pace along the inside, shifted four wide through the upper stretch
and raced evenly with no late run. RAISE YOUR GAME settled off the early pace, moved up three wide near the quarter pole from the outside of rivals and
flattened out in the drive. MISS REMMIA vied for the early lead while racing four deep from the outside of rivals and faded. LADY WHISTLEDOWN was sent

Footnotes
UNION FLEET made a quick bid near the three eighths pole while racing three wide, was under a hand ride in the upper stretch and raced in hand just
inside the eighth pole to be a handy winner while racing well clear. BORN FOR VICTORY showed good early foot to set the early pace from the inside, was
overtaken early and was no match for the winner. SPRITZER chased the early pace from the outside of foes and was no match for the top pair. MAD
GENIUS stalked the pace, raced four to three wide in the drive and had no rally. CODIGO was bumped at the start, raced off the early pace, raced five wide
near the three sixteenths pole and never threatened. GARITOFF broke to the outside, bumped at the start and lacked a bid while racing four wide.
BETTHEOVER was off slowly, raced near the inside and never threatened. NEVER SILENCED was coaxed along early, tired readily and was eased up on
in the stretch.

LARAMORE sent along early from the inside for early positioning, raced two deep past the quarter pole, angled four wide through the upper stretch to race
from the outside of foe and proved best under strong pressure. BLOWTHRUYELOWLITES showed good early pace to set the early lead and gave way late
grudgingly. ROWSIE EXPRESS was bumped at the start, dropped back early on, made an advance through the far turn, raced five wide from the outside of
foes and finished gamely to the wire. LIQUIDATOR was bumped at the start, raced mid pack early, raced near the inside past the quarter pole and raced
evenly with no late run. MISS FUSSY PANTS raced off the early pace, was six deep near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a rally. CREATIVE
CADENCE broke to the outside, chased the pace from the outside, drifted in the lane and was empty. MODELO RUBIA was shuffled back at the break,
raced near the inside and had no response. LADY SERENITY failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
ANACONDA was rated along from the inside down the backstretch, angled past the quarter pole to race from the outside of rival and finished well to edge
clear under steady pressure. MR. HUSTLE tracked the early leader from the outside and kept on willingly to the wire. MATTA showed good early foot to set
the pace along the inside and gave way grudgingly. PASSION PLAY stalked the pace, raced from the inside near the quarter pole, angled to race off the
inside and kept on to the wire. EVER DANGEROUS raced mid pack early on, was four to five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a rally. SCARLETT
SKY raced off the early pace, was near the inside at the quarter pole, angled six wide through the stretch run and never threatened. DENDROBIA settled off
the early going, raced from the inside to saved ground and lacked a bid. BOBBY G was off very slow, raced at the back of the pack after the troubling
beginning, was four deep around the far turn and never threatened. GOING TO THE LEAD raced four wide around the first turn, was two deep near the
quarter pole and never menaced.

MONDAY MORNING QB settled off the top pair, made a quick three wide bid from the outside of foes near the half mile pole, raced well clear into the upper
stretch, drifted through the lane, asked under steady pressure late and held safe. THE KING CHEEK tracked the pace, raced between rivals near the half
mile pole, was five deep into the upper stretch, angled down the rail and finished gamely to the wire. MAJESTIC FRONTIER raced off the early going, raced
from the inside around the far turn through the stretch and was no match for the top pair. DEPOSITORY sent along to set the early pace along the inside
and through early.
