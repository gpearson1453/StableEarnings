Footnotes
SIGNAL FROM NOISE led early on before being displaced by ADAM'S ANGEL, had WINGS LIKE EAGLES advance and take over just inside five furlongs
to go and tracked that rival four wide down the backstretch and through the turn patiently handled through to spinning three wide into upper stretch, took
over command straightened away and was roused at the three-sixteenths, went clear under a drive getting geared down inside the final sixteenth to the
finish, the outcome in no doubt. WINGS LIKE EAGLES just off the pace early on, advanced in the two path on the top pair to take command just inside five
furlongs to run, showed the way patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole under threat for the initial time, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. ADAM'S ANGEL vied
briefly before taking command from the eventual winner to show the way briefly before being displaced on the front just inside five furlongs to go by the
aforementioned foe, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.
CHARGING LADY stumbled at the start in a fainting motion before recovering her legs under her but conceding six to seven lengths to the front, chased
along the inside detached at the tail of the field, floated out two then three to four wide through the turn, angled in to spin just off the inside into upper stretch
and was unable to make an impact. DIVINE WINE chased inside briefly before angling seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, darted back to the
inside half a mile from home put to coaxing and saved ground through the turn, angled four wide for home and tired in the stretch. PRINCESS SONYA
forwardly placed six paths off the inside early on, eased of to chase six then five wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper
stretch, folded, and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
SPOOKY ROAD settled on the outside, dropped from the four path to the three path early on the turn then moved closer to the two path while behind the
vanguard, came out from behind two foes then split rivals in the three path to make a bid coming to the quarter-pole, took over into upper stretch then kicked
clear, extended the advantage under the crop into the final furlong and proved much the best under steady urging. I'M BUZZY was well placed down the
backstretch, came under urging along the rail on the turn, made an inside bid at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead then
lost touch with the winner and proved no match while able to get the place. DANCING SOPHIA settled well off the pace, was urged three wide around the
turn, moved into striking range late on that bend, came six wide into the stretch and flattened out while able to get the show. NEW YORK BANKER went to
the front, moved in leaving the chute, showed the way with a clear advantage, went around the turn in the two path, was asked under threat at the
five-sixteenths, lost the advantage into upper stretch and gave way. I'M NERVOUS NOW angled out in the early going, followed the leader on the outside,
chased in the four path around the turn, came five wide into the stretch and tired. STELLA MARS was forced out by I'M NERVOUS NOW early, settled
towards the back, was urged along inside early on the turn then moved to the three path, angled out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to threaten.
MASABEEH was off slow and spotted the front a couple lengths, settled on the outside at the rear, moved out of last under urging outside the five-eighths,
went five wide around the turn and was no factor. NO PAYNE broke out but was immediately corrected by the rider, showed speed while moving in then
dropped back leaving the chute and switched outside the leader, tracked into the turn, chased in the three path around that bend, was driven four wide into
the stretch and came up empty.

OPTIC WAY brushed at the start by WINNING DRIVE, who broke outwards, dueled in hand early on from the three path with ITS ALL RELEVANT to the
inside, had that rival claim sole command five and a half furlongs from home and continued to apply pressure to the outside tipping four wide through the
turn, advanced once more to take over near the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in
under lone threat and held safe to prevail. WARRIOR IN CHIEF chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper
stretch, offered up a mild kick to threaten outside cutting into the winner's margin in the late stages but was ultimately staved off while well clear of the rest
and along second best. DOUBLE SHOT four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and
kept on to secure the show honors, best of the rest. RUNABOUT chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide for home,
weakened. GOLDINI chased three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper
stretch and tired. WINNING DRIVE broke out at the start brushing OPTIC WAY, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled
five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. ITS ALL RELEVANT coaxed from the start, dueled inside of OPTIC WAY early on before establishing sole
command, tipped to the two path into the turn and came under pressure once more near the midway point on the bend, relented and yielded the front near
the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. AMOUNT six then five wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home,
cornered five wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact.

ALARM CLOCK showed good speed from the outside, moved clear leaving the backstretch, controlled the action in the two path around the turn, spun three
wide into the stretch, responded well in the drive and held under steady urging. RUNAWAY ROCKETTE moved in then was well placed just off the pace,
raced inside to the two path under urging on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, pursued the winner in the drive and finished willingly for the
place. TRAIN TO ARTEMUS pressed the pace towards the inside down the backstretch, dropped off the pace with a half-mile to run, was asked for more
while inside around the turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and weakened while clear for the show. GLITTER UP pressed the pace inside of the leader
down the backstretch, dropped back near the half-mile pole, chased three wide around the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner
into the final furlong and tired. GAL IN A RUSH saved ground while well back in the field, came off the rail into upper stretch, jostled with a foe nearing the
furlong marker and lacked the needed response. MISS TAPIRADO was urged off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, came three wide into
the stretch then moved a bit further out, jostled with a foe coming to the furlong marker and failed to rally. TWEAQUED bumped with a rival at the start, was
urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. CHLOE ROSE was urged along on the outside,
went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and capitulated. FONTANAFREDDA bumped with an opponent at the start, was urged along at
the rear, moved out leaving the backstretch, went five wide on the turn and was no factor. MADRILENA (ARG) chased the pace down the backstretch,
dropped back three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and had nothing left.

SHERIFF BIANCO was urged along on the outside, gained in the three path around the turn, took over into upper stretch and drew away under strong
urging to prove much the best. UNIQUE UNIONS pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path around the turn, gained the lead outside the
five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. ADVANCED STRATEGY broke out at the
start, showed no speed under urging, moved in leaving the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, angled out in upper stretch and was along for
the show. BREW PUB was sent hard from the gate then chased the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, came out three wide at the
quarter-pole and weakened. QUICK RETURN was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, settled under some coaxing, raced inside early on the turn then
shifted three wide, spun four wide into the stretch and came up empty. FOOLISH GHOST was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to his
outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was headed outside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and faded. BRONX BOMBER broke a bit
awkwardly, dropped back under urging, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. NUEVA YORK stumbled badly at
the start then bumped with a foe, went around the turn in the three path and was no factor.
