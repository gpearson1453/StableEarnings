SILVIA broke well and made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace and drew off in the stretch under right handed urging. CURRENT CLIMATE raced
outside, dug in late and got up for second four wide. CONTENT stalked the pace and finished with good courage two wide. SHEISTHEHERO chased the
winner and lacked the needed kick three wide while finishing on even terms with CONTENT at the wire. CEVICHE dropped to the inside on the turn and
went evenly in the stretch. SIMONA'S CHOICE had good early speed then faded. ANDIAMA close up early, failed to respond. EMITYAAZ had good early
speed five wide and was through after a half. CAJUN DELIGHT was no threat. HIGH MEADOWS trailed.

BAY MAGIC battled for the early lead three wide, took charge on the turn then widened the balance of the trip under strong handling to win as much the
best. SWEET BETTY JOYCE vied for the lead four wide and finished second best near mid track. J J'S FANCY close up behind rivals, angled outside on
the turn then finished with good courage in the middle of the racetrack. JUSTA COWGIRL stumbled for multiple strides at the start, swung wide and had a
mild late rally past mid track. SCARLETT'S AWISH dueled for the early lead along the inside and was through after a half. LADY POWER was outrun.
CONGRATS JENSEN contested the lead two wide into the turn then gave way.

Footnotes
WHOVILLE stalked the early pace, surged three wide into the stretch, dug in under right handed urging and proved best in a stiff drive. BLACK BUTTE
never far back, the rider lost her lost whip at the three sixteenths pole, dug in under a hand ride and got up for second four wide. GOOD ALTERNATIVE
trailed early and was steadily gaining ground late two wide in a determined effort. CHILLIN LADY away alertly, set s pressured pace until deep stretch then
was outfinished in a game effort. MAVI offered a mild bid on the turn then leveled off. JILLY FROM JERSEY vied for the early lead along the inside and
faded in the stretch. PROUD MAID MARIAN pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then weakened late. UP IN ARMS failed to menace.
