Footnotes
JAZZY LOVE was unhurried in the early stages, raced three wide into the backstretch run, was roused two wide approaching the quarter marker, rallied
three wide for the drive, overtook PURPLE NIGHT leaving the furlong grounds and kicked clear in the late stages. PURPLE NIGHT showed early speed,
ceded the lead into the backstretch run, re-assumed command nearing the quarter marker, could not hold off JAZZY LOVE nearing mid-stretch and was
outkicked, while well clear of the rest for second. SPORTS FOR WOMEN was allowed to settle, saved ground through the backstretch run, lost ground
nearing the quarter marker, lacked a rally in the stretch run and was an easy third in the end. GREAT GIFT tracked the pace from the inside, lost position
nearing the second turn, came three wide into the far turn, slipped to the rail for the drive and came up empty in the stretch run. PRAY FOR SNOW
assumed command along the first turn, set modest fractions through the backstretch run, was overtaken nearing the quarter marker, lost ground in upper
stretch, drifted out while tiring inside of the furlong marker and did not offer a late response. BIG GIFT stumbled leaving the start, unseated the jockey and
walked off under her own power. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START INVOLVING BIG GIFT. THE STEWARDS
DETERMINED BIG GIFT CAUSED HER OWN ISSUES AT THE START AND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO ORDER OF FINISH BASED
ON THE INCIDENT.

Footnotes
BORKAN was asked to show early speed, set solid fractions while well handled through the turn, drew clear approaching mid-stretch, was geared down and
was hand-ridden to the wire in the final sixteenth. THUNDER OF ZION was forwardly placed into the turn, pressed the solid pace to the quarter marker,
could not match strides with BORKAN in the drive and was second best. AWESOME CURLIN was unhurried, improved three wide on the turn, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, did not offer the needed late response and stayed on in the final strides to secure third. BALLROOM HUSTLER chased from the inside, was
outrun in upper stretch, did not produce a late rally and just missed for show in the final strides. INDIANERA tracked the solid early pace, came three wide to
the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way. LUCK IS GOLDEN showed early speed while not far back, lost ground on the turn and was
not a factor.

Footnotes
MOONSHINE CAT was allowed to settle, came three wide into the backstretch run, circled the field three then four wide turning into the drive, made a
grinding rally inside of the furlong marker, caught SHAMAN'S PRODIGY in deep stretch and made a late surge to prevail. SHAMAN'S PRODIGY was asked
to show early speed from the inside and assumed command into the first turn, was well rated through modest fractions to the half-mile marker, was
confronted by GOLD RUSH GAL on the second turn and battled with that foe to mid-stretch, could not hold off the oncoming MOONSHINE CAT in deep
stretch and won the nod for place in the final strides. GOLD RUSH GAL settled four wide off of the early pace, advanced along the backstretch run, made a
three wide move to challenge for the lead nearing the quarter marker, battled to mid-stretch, was outclosed in the final sixteenth, was just edged for place in
the final strides and was well clear for show in the end. COCORITA settled off of the early fractions while saving ground, advanced nearing the half-mile
marker to stalk the pace to the far turn, saved ground to the top of the lane and gave way. TYCHE AWAITS YOU was forwardly placed into the first turn, lost
position along the backstretch run, dropped back while two then four wide approaching the top of the lane and did not offer a late rally. TEXAS CHARM was
prominent in the early going, stalked the pace three wide into the backstretch run, kept close attendance to the pacesetter to the half-mile, lost position
nearing the quarter marker and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
GOOD TIME DOLLY was sent to the early lead and drew to a clear advantage along the first turn, set reasonable fractions while well handled through the
backstretch run, held foes at bay to mid-stretch and drew clear in the final sixteenth. MISS EVER READY was unhurried in the early stages, raced along the
rail to the second turn, gained ground in upper stretch, was no match for the winner in the late stages but closed well in deep stretch to secure second.
MYBLUEBELL (FR) stalked the decent fractions from the inside, maintained position through the backstretch run, tipped out two wide for the drive, ran
evenly to the furlong marker, weakened in the late stages and was just edged for second. DANCE LADY was allowed to settle while not far back, was
roused two then three wide nearing the top of the lane, lost ground in upper stretch and lacked a late response. HERE COMES RALPHIE settled three wide
off of the early fractions, was steered four wide outside of rivals on the far turn and did not mount a late rally. MULHIMA (IRE) stalked the early pace into the
first turn, advanced to prompt the pace through the backstretch run, lost ground on the second turn, was eased through the lane and walked off under her
own power.

Footnotes
SMILING MELANIE settled off of the early pace while in the second flight, raced two wide to the second turn while advancing, chased in pursuit of
RELUCTANT leaving the quarter marker, overtook that rival inside of the furlong pole and drew clear while on the left lead in deep stretch. RELUCTANT
showed early speed and tracked the pace into the first turn, challenged HASTA LUEGO nearing the half-mile marker then took command into the second
turn, drew clear nearing the quarter marker, felt pressure from SMILING MELANIE nearing the furlong grounds, could not hold that rival off for the final
stages and held well in the end for second. CHELINA was allowed to settle in the early stages while never far back, came three wide into the backstretch
run, advanced two wide on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed well in the late stages and secured third in the final strides. VALDINI was unhurried in
the early stages, came three wide into the backstretch run, slipped to inside while advancing on the far turn, rallied with good interest in the drive and just
missed for show. FUNKY GREY was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the pace from a three wide path through the backstretch run, came four
wide for the stretch drive, lost ground nearing the furlong marker and weakened. DARK INTENT settled along the inside in the early going, advanced four
wide on the second turn, steered five wide for the drive and did not produce a late rally. FLYING SYLVIA was floated four wide into the first turn, settled off
of the decent fractions through the backstretch run, was steered two wide nearing the top of the lane and did not factor in the drive. HASTA LUEGO was a
bit fractious in the starting gate, showed good early speed and set the pace into the first turn, set a pressured pace through the backstretch run, dropped
back on the second turn, was eased through the stretch and walked off under her own power.

REV REE settled along the inside in the early stages, advanced along the backstretch run, loomed nearing the quarter marker, battled with DERRYGOOLIN
to mid-stretch, raced on the left lead while being asked for run in deep stretch, switched leads and determinedly prevailed in the final stages.
DERRYGOOLIN was prominent into the first turn, assumed command along the backstretch run, was confronted by REV REE nearing the quarter marker,
dueled with that rival to mid-stretch, was put to steady urging while battling inside of the furlong marker and was gamely bested in deep stretch, while just
holding for second in the final strides. VRONSKY FEINT was allowed to settle, gained ground while improving position along the second turn, chased the
dueling top pair to mid-stretch, closed willingly in the late stages, just missed for place and was clear for show in the end. GEA was unhurried in the early
going, saved ground to the half-mile, advanced two wide nearing the quarter marker, chased into the drive and offered a mild late rally. WORTHY OF
MAGIC was forwardly placed in the early stages, maintained position through the backstretch run, lost ground on the second turn and weakened in the
drive. MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN raced in the second flight while settling off of the pace, lost position along the backstretch run, steadied entering the second
turn and did not threaten in the final stages. BEIGNET was fractious in the gate prior to the start, showed speed leaving the break and established the early
advantage, ceded the lead along the backstretch run, dropped back on the second turn, was eased through the lane and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
BOSSY MAMA broke sharply and showed good early speed to establish the pace, drew clear along the turn while carving solid fractions, was set down for
the drive, kept to task in deep stretch over oncoming rivals and held safely in the end to prevail. SWANEE settled off of the solid early pace, was well
positioned while two wide nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed fast in deep stretch, could not reel in the winner in the end and was
up for second in the final strides. SMOKIN HOT BOBBIE threw her head at the break and was away a step slowly, rushed up to be just off the pace into the
turn, came two wide to the quarter marker, gained ground nearing mid-stretch, closed willingly in the late stages and was just edged for place in the final
strides. PHANTOM INDIAN was allowed to settle, raced three wide on the turn, swung five wide for the drive and closed with a rush in deep stretch, while
unable to reel in the leaders. TONI TWO POCKET contested the early pace, tracked the pacesetter along the turn, drifted out at the top of the lane to go
four wide for the drive and weakened. CROWN KITTEN took back off of the early pace, saved ground on the turn, advanced in upper stretch, ran evenly in
the final furlong and was outkicked late. DANIELA BELLA lacked early speed, improved position two wide on the turn, continued to advance in upper
stretch, came in tight in mid-stretch and was gaining in the final stages. SUPERSONIC FLYER showed early speed and tracked the pace to the turn, lost
position while three then four wide nearing the top of the lane and did not mount a late rally. LOUD FUSAICHI chased the early fractions, came four wide
along the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
ALL content to race mid-pack and wide for a half-mile, turned for home well in hand, responded to strong handling and overpowered the field in the final
furlong to draw clear. MISS ARROWHEAD took up a few strides out of the gate when her path was taken by PULPIT SINGER and ALL, attempted to save
some ground heading into the turn but had to check when ALL took her path again, took the three path through the turn, swung seven wide for clear run to
the wire and produced a bold rally to gain the place. SIMPLY PERFECT broke out and bumped DANGEROUS ILLUSION after the break, recovered and
then gained a clear early lead while in hand, held sway to deep stretch and finished well for third while unable to fend off the closing rush of the top pair.
ARISTEIA was outrun in the early stages, trailed the field through the turn, swung extremely wide into the stretch and rallied well enough to pass a few in
the end. STAND IN YOUR LOVE broke in and brushed with DANGEROUS ILLUSION, was up close early and made an early move towards the pacesetter
past the seven-sixteenths pole, saved ground along the turn, loomed a threat to deep stretch but was unable to find another gear when needed. JUMPING
JILL FLASH got a clear tracking trip from the outside, racing in about the three-path down the backside, remained there through the turn, launched a bid
from the three-furlong marker, came in to the stretch three-wide and with good momentum, finished well but needed more. PULPIT SINGER broke alertly
and was with the early leaders through the turn, was asked to quicken passing the half-mile marker and mustered a mild rally while never being a serious
threat. BIG CHICK was off a step slow and spotted the field several lengths, moved up while racing on the rail down the backstretch, saved ground through
the turn, awaited room to deep stretch, swung out for clear run but did not have a response. DANGEROUS ILLUSION took up after the break when
squeezed by rivals from both sides, raced near the rear of the field to the stretch, was unable to find room from behind horses, swung to the outside but did
not run on. AMAAZA broke out a bit at the start, tracked the early pacesetter to the top of the stretch, did not have much of a response when asked to
quicken and slowly faded in the final furlong.
