turn, dueled in the stretch and gave way in the final sixteenth of a mile. PARABELLUM raced off the pace on the inside in the early going, navigated the turn
from the two path and gained ground in late stretch. DIRT BIKE SLADE raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the
two and three path and made no bid. ABETEMARCO chased the leader on the inside in the opening stages, saved ground around the bend and faded in
the stretch. LONESTAR CHROME stalked the pace setter on the outside, raced in the four path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and was

BRICKBAT raced in the three and four path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path
passing the half mile pole and kicked clear in the stretch while drifting mildly late. PASAMONTE MAN saved ground around the first turn, settled off the pace
on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, switched to the outside in upper stretch, brushing with DIGGERS
GOLD in the process and gained ground from there. DIGGER'S GOLD raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile,
navigated the far turn from the three path, was forced out when PASAMONTE MAN came into his lane in upper stretch, recovered and kept on to the wire.
ESTEEMED trailed the field from the three path through the opening half mile, came around the second turn in the two path and had no kick. SAMURAI
JACK raced in the two path around the first turn, led the way on the inside up the backstretch, gave way while saving ground around the second bend and
weakened further in the lane. JEDI WARRIOR raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, began to
drop back while racing in the three path around the far turn and continued to fade from there. AN INQUIRY WAS MADE CONCERNING THE CONTACT IN
UPPER STRETCH. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

brushing with FINGLAS LAD in the process and continued on gamely to the wire, getting passed late. RIO CUTIE bumped lightly with the horse to her inside
at the start, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and gained ground through the final
furlong. INFINITE CROWN veered out leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path
and improved position in the lane. SO CAL MEMORY tracked the pace setters on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path
around the turn and weakened in late stretch. FROGGY was away from the gate slowly, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn
and passed tiring horses in the lane. DINOS DA DADDY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, came around the bend in the four

and tired in the stretch. BREXTON bumped mildly with the horse to his outside at the start, raced at the back of the pack in the opening stages, came
