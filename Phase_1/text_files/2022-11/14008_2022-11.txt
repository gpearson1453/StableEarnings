Footnotes
RED KNOBS tracked two to three wide, pressed the newly leader under coaxing around the far turn, bid in upper stretch, and kicked away at the furlong
grounds. MUGSY MALONE stalked two wide, pressed down the backstretch, gained an advantage at the three furlong pole as an outer rival menaced, then
failed to resist that foe's bid in upper stretch, gave way through the final furlong, but found the wire in time to save place. TEST PILOT set the pace inside of
a pressing foe, got headed at the three furlong pole, gave way to the top pair through upper stretch, but shifted off of the rail in the final furlong, and kept on
between horses to bid for place again nearing the wire, but missed. TOTALIZER tracked along the inside, chased the leaders under urging around the far
turn, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, but lacked a bid. READY PURSUIT was outrun.

Footnotes
MS HAYLEY stalked in the two path while inside of a rival, tipped outside of the top pair at the three furlong pole, bid turning for home, gained an advantage
at the three sixteenths pole, and kicked away. ESSER FUND was reluctant to load, then hopped slightly while breaking multiple lengths slow, raced far ack
in the three path, then launched a rally by splitting foes in the four path in upper stretch, and sustained her charge to reach place at the wire. LADY ENVOY
tracked in midpack in the two path, shifted five wide entering the lane, rallied to claim place at the sixteenth pole, but got nailed at the wire. SMOOTH LIKE
ICE was tough to load, dueled for the lead along the inside, clung to an advantage from a trio of foes nearing the lane, but failed to keep pace with the
eventual winner in upper stretch, and faded while losing place a sixteenth from home. CANARY NATION broke a step slowly, laid off of the pace in the three
to two paths around the turn, and failed to menace. TWELVE SHARP stalked in the three path, got floated to the four path by the eventual winner at the
three furlong pole, ranged up outside of the leading trio nearing the lane, but weekend in upper stretch, and drifted in while giving way. PRANA raced in
midpack in the three to four path, but faded after floating six wide entering the lane. SHE HAS THE LOOK dueled for the lead two wide, but weakened
between horses entering the lane. RALLYING HEART broke slowly and showed little. BOGEY FREE was prominent along the inside early on, but failed to
keep pace with an outer pair after a quarter mile, then began to pull up entering the turn, was dismounted and untacked near the five sixteenths pole, and
got vanned off.

Footnotes
SWEET LADY IVANKA patiently saved ground off of the pace, came into the lane two wide and between horses while being the leaders, searched for
racing room in upper stretch, bumped an outer rival while aiming for the same hole as that foe leaving the three sixteenths pole, decided on an two wide split
approaching midstretch, surged through that opening at the furlong grounds, and drew clear. PARTYLINE rated at the rear three to two wide, came into the
lane three wide while outside of the eventual winner, awaited racing room behind traffic in upper stretch, took a bump from that foe while hoping to split the
leaders three wide leaving the three sixteenths pole, altered course five wide at the furlong grounds, but saw his inner bidding counterpart get a jump in the
process, then chased that foe home and gained place at the wire. WHAT'S TO DO settled off of the pace two wide, tipped four wide entering the lane,
grinded away to bid at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an inner foe leaving that juncture, then got caught on the wire by an outer oncharging rival
for place. SUNROOF stalked two wide, chased the clear leader around the far turn before bidding in upper stretch, vied entering midstretch, but was
outkicked by rivals on either side at the furlong grounds, and yielded. TWENTYTWENTY HOAX set the pace, enjoyed a clear advantage down the
backstretch, resisted a rival's bid in upper stretch, but was headed by multiple foes at the furlong grounds, and faltered. APPLE EVER AFTER tracked along
the inside, but failed to progress before fading through the final furlong. TIFFANY'S MO was bleeding from the mouth moving to post, tracked three wide,
then faded after floating five wide entering the lane.

Footnotes
DEUS EX MACHINA rushed to set the pace inside of a pair of vying foes, shook clear in upper stretch, and inched away under driving pressure. NORGAY
prompted the pace two wide and between horses, vied turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, and held place. BOURBON
ON FIRE broke a bit outwardly at the start, tracked from off of the pace in the four to five paths around the turn, then stayed on mildly, reached show in
midstretch, and lasted from an outer rival for that position late. MY FAVORITE UNCLE settled off of the pace two wide, shifted out six wide approaching the
final furlong, and stayed on to miss reaching show. SCRATCHOFF stalked in the three path, tipped to the four path in hopes of ranging up outside of the
leading trio turning for home, but only managed to chase while getting outkicked entering the lane, and faded. CLIQUER moved forward to an inside stalking
position down the backstretch, pursued from the two path around the turn, but faded through the lane. C J ALL THE WAY broke multiple paths outwardly at
the start, pressed three wide, but faded nearing the lane. DIVISION STREET broke a step slowly before severely shying from an inner foe at the start, and
never got involved. STRICKLAND was outrun. GRASSROOTS lacked speed along the inside, and tired.

Footnotes
MEDWAY QUEEN stalked along the inside, moved through a large rail opening in upper stretch to bid for the lead at the three sixteenths pole, and drew off.
SOCIAL MANDATE stalked three wide, chased the leader from the three path around the turn, but was outkicked by an inner rival in upper stretch and kept
on to prove second best. EXPECT THE BOSS laid off of the pace in the four path, tucked to the three path entering the lane, improved between horses in
upper stretch, and stayed on to reach show late. ARLYNE'S CROWN set a clear pace while remaining in the two path around the turn, but proved no match
for a rail bidder in upper stretch, and readily weakened. PONTIFFANY raced in midpack in the three to four path and between horses around the turn,
sustained chasing position in upper stretch, but tired approaching the final furlong. KAIYAS SONG bobbled while breaking slowly, raced far back in the three
path, swung to the six path entering the lane, and moved up. INSPEIGHTFUL chased two wide and between horses, but steadily faded after a quarter mile.
COOL CAROL tucked to the rail whilst midpack into the turn, saved ground, but faded. EYEOFTHEBEHOLDER never got involved. DILMUNIA broke slowly,
lacked speed in the four path, and made little impact. MISS MARPLE saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. SIS BOOM BOB raced in midpack in the
four to five path while outside of foes, and weakened.

UNIFYING vied for the lead two wide and between horses, led entering the lane, gamely showed the way from chasers on both sides through midstretch,
and inched clear in the final sixteenth. SECRET STATEMENT laid off of the pace along the inside, but was steadied along under tight restraint for over a
furlong heading into the turn, moved forward to track from just off of the rail around the bend, then pursued from behind the leaders while hanging on his left
lead through midstretch, changed over between horses entering the final sixteenth, and stayed on to reach place late. BE HERE NOW vied for the lead
inside of a pair of foes around the turn, fought on after his most immediate counterpart forged an advantage in upper stretch, but gave way a sixteenth from
home. RING TWICE chased four wide, floated five wide at the three furlong pole, ranged up turning for home to bid four wide entering the lane, but only
managed to chase the leading pair through midstretch, then was outkicked by an inner foe for show at the sixteenth pole while flattening out. TITLED LADY
broke slowly while bumping the gate, raced off of the pace two wide and between horses while taking the turn in the three path, gradually shifted out to the
six path coming to midstretch, but lacked a bid while hanging on her left lead. HAPPYSECRET tracked in the four path, but yielded while getting outmoved
by an inner foe at the three furlong pole, and kept on without threatening. TAMARA'S WAY never got involved. SIRIUS LIGHT stalked behind the leading
trio into the turn, tipped outside of them at the three furlong pole, bid between horses turning for home, but failed to change leads entering the lane, and
weakened in upper stretch. FOR THE BISCUIT vied three wide, but weakened between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
THOUGHT took a bump from an inner foe at the start, stalked the leading pair from the three path, bid in upper stretch sparking a duel with TRIGGER
HAPPY, and prevailed. TRIGGER HAPPY stumbled outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, set the pace two wide as an inner foe pressed, disposed of
that foe while an outer THOUGHT menaced, dug in and dueled through the final furlong, but was bested. MOON DOG laid off of the pace in the two path,
shifted out to the five path entering the lane, grinded in pursuit of the leading pair entering midstretch in hopes of taking aim, but flopped back to his left lead
inside while leveling off the final sixteenth, and was best of the rest. MILITARY FORCE bumped the gate while breaking in a tangle, raced far back along the
inside, rallied along the rail through the turn, tipped two wide at the quarter pole, but failed to sustain a bid, flattened out, and gave way through the late
stages. MUNDO MIX pressed the leader from the inside, but weakened in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead. OFFICIAL BUSINESS laid off of the
pace while caught in the five path around the turn, and faded. MARK THE MOOSE chased in the four path, but weakened around the turn. COMMANDER
COMPTON showed little and was eased through the lane. HORSE DADDY never got involved before being pulled up entering the lane, then was
dismounted and untacked in upper stretch, and got vanned off.

Footnotes
ARI OAKLEY set the pace two wide before clearing her inner challenger into the turn, dug in to resist MISS T TOO's bid turning for home, shook free of that
foe in upper stretch, then held gamely from an outer bidder in the closing stages. PERFECT HAPPINESS tracked four wide, rallied in pursuit of the clear
leader in the final furlong, bid nearing the wire, but was fended off. MISS T TOO stalked three wide, moved forward to press two wide at the three furlong
pole, bid turning for home, but was turned away in upper stretch, sustained her chase between horses in the final furlong, but was outkicked by an outer foe
foe place entering the final sixteenth, then saved show. MINUTE WALTZ prompted the pace along the inside before backing off to stalk entering the turn,
the chased evenly from the two path and behind the leaders through the final furlong. LADY GOLDSTART tracked in midpack in the two path, moved out to
the five path in upper stretch, and slowly grinded away. AVA'S GRACE tracked two to three wide and between horses around the turn, chased entering the
lane, but yielded at the furlong grounds. ALTERED SHOT was brushed by an outer rival into an inner foe at the start, then checked slightly to back out from
between horses at the nine sixteenths pole, raced off of the pace in the three path around the turn, and failed to factor. READY FOR CHANGE lacked speed
along the inside, and never got involved. MAYBE I WILL was briefly antsy awaiting the start, then broke a bit tardily, raced at the rear while hung in the five
path around the turn, and made little impact. QUOTABELLE chased briefly in the four path, but steadily faded into and around the turn.

Footnotes
CHARLEE MAE prompted the pace two wide, assumed command turning for home, and drew off under driving pressure. GRAY VIXEN broke slowly, raced
off of the pace in the four path, then stayed on to gain place between horses at the wire. LADAN chased in the three to four path, gained place approaching
the final furlong while not threatening the leader, but was bested by an inner bidder late. MOR HAPPY HOURS tracked in the four path before tucking to the
rail leaving the three furlong pole, improved inside of rivals to bid for place at the furlong grounds, but leveled off while kept at bay. KING'S MISTRESS
raced far back two wide and failed to factor. NURSEKRINGLEDANCES raced in midpack in the two path, and faded. PERFECTLY GOLDEN was off a step
slowly while breaking a bit out, and made little impact in the four path. OUR LILY ROBIN was outrun. LADY OCEAN was hustled to the fore early on, set the
pace inside of a vying rival, but proved no match turning for home, and caved on her left lead. CRAZY FACE broke slowly and was outrun along the inside.
