LADY DANAE dueled for the lead with OUR TEN ANGLES while racing four-wide, responded when challenged by NATION OF LAWS into the lane and
drew off with complete authority. TAP ME A TEXT was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further
approaching the stretch and was up for the place. NATION OF LAWS bobbled at the start, recovered quickly to press the pace while racing three-wide,
moved five-wide through the turn, offered a bid nearing the three-sixteenths pole and gave way. LEMON DROP LADY settled off the leaders early, moved
three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. MISS LUCKY LADY lagged early, raced six-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. OUR TEN
ANGELS disputed the pace with the winner for a half and weakened.

approaching the stretch and rallied late. REBEL RYETTE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached a striking position in

Footnotes
FLAMING BESITOS raced unhurried early, circled the field while racing eighth-wide, reached the fore with a furlong to run, vied with FLOWER POWER and
held that rival safe late. FLOWER POWER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, gained a brief lead into the lane,
responded when challenged by the winner with a furlong to run and gave way grudgingly to that rival in a hard drive. BLAME THE TEQUILA set a pressured
pace while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. STELLA WHEAT broke sharply to chase the leaders from the inside and gave way in
the drive. SISTER MARK lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ANDYMEISTER chased the leaders while racing three-wide,
weakened after going three furlongs and was eased through the lane. PEPPERMINT GIRL chased the leaders while racing five-wide, lugged out through
the turn, weakened and was eased.

sixteenth. OUR SOARING ANGEL was reserved just off the leaders early, was carried out nearing the quarter and finished well in the drive. MARILYN
MONEYROLL pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide throughout and gave way late. AWESOME WALKER lacked early speed, raced
three-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. RATIONAL D'ORO was forwardly placed early, moved six-wide through the turn and gave way in the
drive. GRACEANNE was checked at the start then allowed to settle, raced six-wide through the turn and did not menace. ATHENA'S STORM chased the

Footnotes
SEEULATERGATOR pressed the pace of SILVER PONZI while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths marker and drew
off as a handy winner. DOCTOR TINK settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and was up for the place. YES ITSA STAR was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. SILVER PONZI broke sharply to set a pressured pace
from the inside and gave way to the winner after the opening quarter. SOLID GOLD BAR was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, drifted
inward in mid-stretch and did not threaten. HOT CHARLIE was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive.
DIABOLICAL KING settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, steadied nearing the three-sixteenths marker and failed to gain in the
drive. SECRET LIFE STYLE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. NOT THAT SERIOUS lacked early foot, raced
three-wide through the turn and did not menace. BIND ME UP showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.
WILLY TELL HIM lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not menace.
