Footnotes
QUARREL established a forward position early, raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, issued a challenge in the two
path on the far turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole, responded well when set down in upper stretch and held gamely under strong urging. TANGENTIAL
went around the first turn in the two path, was well placed just off the pace, drafted inside on the far turn, was given her cue in the two path at the
quarter-pole, chased the winner into the final furlong, made a bid into the final sixteenth but just missed while narrowly able to get the place. HAY STACK
angled in towards the rear down the opening straightaway, saved ground around the opening bend, was reserved off the pace, traveled in the two path
around most of the far turn, shifted four wide while asked inside the five-sixteenths, came six wide into upper stretch, rallied in the final furlong and closed
well to just miss while up for the show. TELENDOS stumbled after the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved at the back, saved ground
early on the far turn, moved to the two then three path late on that bend, came five wide into upper stretch then moved further out, rallied outside in the final
furlong and finished with good energy for the last spot in the superfecta in a good effort. THEGIRLFROMIRELAND went five wide around the first turn, was
bumped soundly by a foe inside the three-quarter pole, settled on the outside, was asked in the three path on the far turn, ranged up passing the
five-sixteenths, came under a drive in upper stretch, chased the winner to the wire and finished willingly but missed the superfecta. JUSTIFIABLE BELLE
pulled under tight restraint while inside around the first turn, came out early on the backstretch then bumped soundly with a foe, raced in the two path while
under some restraint on the far turn, was roused into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. SENORA LOCA brushed with a foe at the start, went to the
front, showed the way on the inside, was headed by the winner at the quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and gave way. SELF
CONFIDENT brushed with a foe at the start, went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the back, raced inside for most of the far turn then
shifted to the two path, was asked for her best in upper stretch then carried out near the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response. VOLATILITY went
three wide on the first turn, was guided out behind trouble early on the backstretch, settled towards the back, went three wide under urging on the far turn,
came five wide into upper stretch, drifted out in pursuit of the leader near the sixteenth-pole and also lacked the needed response. EMBRACE ME went
three wide on the first turn, was taken up when a foe cut in front early on the backstretch then dropped back, raced three wide on the far turn, came out four
to five wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. STORMY LASS was fractious in the gate, went four wide on the first turn, was rated just off the pace on the
outside, came under urging in the three path on the far turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong before collapsing after the race.

Footnotes
QUEENS MASTERPIECE broke in at the start bumping BOSSY BECKY in tandem with CAUSE I'M ELEGANT, who broke outwards, and squeezing that
foe back before continuing inwards taking over the lane and forcing BOSSY BECKY to check off her heels, chased five wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths and advancing to take narrow command swinging four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive inching away to the finish and held sway to
prevail. BOSSY BECKY got bumped between foes who each broke her way and was squeezed back between them, then got forced to check off the heels
of the aforementioned foe as that rival continued inwards without correction, conceded five to six lengths to the front because of it, chased four then three
wide from near the rear of the field getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three to four wide for home and offered up a good finish closing
stoutly to the end to secure the place honors. GRACEFUL ROSE chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. SPLASHY chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. GOOD MORNING KISS prompted the pace of CENTRAL SPEED from the outside four
then three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, went three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late going.
CENTRAL SPEED showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from the outside by GOOD MORNING KISS, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths under challenge, yielded the front near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. SLOW
DOWN SUMMER stumbled at the start, chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened
in the final furlong. CAUSE I'M ELEGANT broke out at the start bumping BOSSY BECKY in concert with QUEENS MASTERPIECE, who broke inwards,
and squeezed back that middle rival before being corrected, chased along the inside throughout, cornered just off thee inside into upper stretch, trailed, and
was eased home to the finish.

JERRY THE NIPPER was well placed just off the pace on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, chased behind the
leader into the final furlong, accelerated while tipping out nearing the sixteenth-pole and surged past the runner-up to prevail. OCEAN ATLANTIQUE was
hustled to the front, showed the way on the inside, responded well when set down in upper stretch, led under a strong hand-ride into the final sixteenth, was
put to the crop while being confronted by the winner late and was caught while clear for the place. KINENOS dropped back quickly after the start, saved
ground at the rear of the field, came out at the quarter-pole, raced behind a foe at the three-sixteenths, was put to the crop outside the furlong marker and
improved to just get the show. CALL ME HARRY showed speed on the inside of a foe then was taken back and conceded the front, switched to the outside
before the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside in the two path, was given his cue on the far turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and
weakened. SPACE LAUNCH was taken in hand down the initial straightaway, was rated on the outside in the three path, came under urging on the far turn
and lacked the needed response. ANALYZE IT tugged at the bit when taken in hand near the wire for the first time, raced in the two path under restraint
around the first turn, settled more kindly down the backstretch, was roused three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. IT
CAN BE DONE brushed the inside of the gate, moved out nearing the wire for the first time, traveled in the two path around the first turn, settled towards the
back, went four wide on the far turn, was roused five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CHULAINN two to three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, rallied
to issue a challenge through the final furlong dueling from the sixteenth marker to the finish and gamely got the bob on the wire. DRIPPING GOLD just off
the inside tracking the leader in closest aim, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a
furlong out, dug in dueling through the final sixteenth but lost the nod at the finish. CONSTITUTIONLAWYER grew rank off heels of a rival along the inside
through the first turn before settling to track along the rail, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and kicked on
belatedly to secure the show honors. DANZIGWITHTHESTARS along the inside in pursuit from mid pack early on, tipped four wide down the backstretch
before tucking three wide through the final turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick.
QUIET OUT EAST forwardly placed three wide through the first turn, advanced tucking two wide and then to the rail when taking sole command past the
stands the initial time, showed the way spurting away through the clubhouse turn and into the backstretch, had the field take steadily closer order into the far
turn and came under coaxing near the quarter pole in response under threat for the first time, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat
and was collared a furlong from home, then weakened in the late stages. BOLD LICORICE led early on before conceding the front to track along the inside
from a loose pocket, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. EXULT saved ground
near the rear early on before chasing four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked two to three wide through the final turn getting placed to coaxing
three furlongs from home, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and had no rally. DANTE'S FIRE two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and made no headway. CURBSTONE tracked along the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tired, and was eased home to the finish. HAIL TO THEE chased two to three wide under coaxing
from three furlongs out, went four wide into upper stretch and was eased home to the wire.

Footnotes
CHURCHTOWN went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace on the inside, came off the rail into upper stretch, responded well in the final furlong
and held sway under strong urging. STEADY ON bumped soundly with a rival at the start, raced in the three path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the
outside, was asked in the three path on the far turn, chased the winner into the final furlong, gained on that foe late but missed while just up for the place.
GRAND SONATA was well placed just off the pace on the inside, chased along the rail with room in upper stretch, had the hole close very briefly then open
again around the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly to just miss the place while up for the show. DAKOTA GOLD bumped with a foe at the start, tucked
into the two path around the first turn, was rated on the outside, went three then four wide on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths and lacked the
needed kick. RIOT HOUSE stalked the pace on the outside in the two path, was corrected off the heels of the leader when that foe came out into upper
stretch, chased into the final furlong and weakened. WICKED FAST was bumped on both sides at the start then pinched back, saved ground at the rear of
the field, angled out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. MARINARA SAUCED broke in and bumped soundly with a foe, moved in entering the first turn,
settled on the inside, came under a drive in upper stretch and failed to rally. OHTWOOHTHREEFIVE bumped with a rival at the start, saved ground on the
first turn, was unhurried towards the rear, came under urging in the two path on the far turn and failed to threaten. WOW WHATA SUMMER broke
awkwardly then bumped with a foe and was taken up, went three to four wide towards the rear, shifted five wide at the five-sixteenths then was taken in
hand of heels and came up empty.

Footnotes
PATRIA showed good speed, set the pace under pressure from her outside, vied in the two path while asked on the turn, battled with the runner-up in the
stretch and held gamely under strong urging. BUSTIN BULLET pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path around the turn, battled outside of
the winner under a drive in the stretch and missed while clear for the place. MASTEROF THE TUNES bumped lightly with a foe at the start, settled off the
pace, went two then three wide on the turn, was roused five wide into the stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong and finished with good energy to garner
the show. DUFRESNE settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. SERENADE
SOLDIER was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was given her cue outside the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch, remained on
her inside lead in the drive and lacked the needed response. SMOKIN' HOT KITTY was fractious in the gate, settled off the pace, saved ground for most of
the turn then moved to the two path, swung four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. TIS A PITY was urged along on the outside, went four then three
wide on the turn and also lacked the needed response. SEDONA ROCKS was hustled from the start, chased the pace on the outside, dropped back two to
three wide on the turn and also failed to rally. SHIGEKO broke a step slow, settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, swung five wide into the
stretch and was no factor. PROPER GRAMMAR was restless in the gate, bumped lightly with a foe at the start, was urged along off the pace, dropped from
the two path the rail on the turn, hesitated inside the five-sixteenths and failed to impact. LADY OF THOROTON was off slow and spotted the front several
lengths, settled at the rear, went three wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. SALSA A PARTE was slow into stride, angled in
towards the rear, went around the turn in the two path, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
