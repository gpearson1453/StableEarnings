Footnotes
CANYON DEL ORO saved ground stalking the pace, angled out nearing the quarter pole, was four-wide entering stretch, caught the leaders at the eighth
pole and won drawing clear. HIT A NOTE prompted Aisle Runner from along the outside, responded when asked and finished well for the place in a game
effort. AISLE RUNNER saved ground setting the pressured pace into the stretch, wasn't quite good enough but held on well for the show. GOLDEN
MERGER saved ground while being allowed to settle in stretch, swung out to come four-wide into the stretch, angled in during the drive and was gaining
slightly late. JUVAL was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. SIXTH GEAR dropped back early, saved ground
and was not a factor.

CASUAL ENCOUNTER stalked the pace while racing two-wide, responded to pressure and was up in the final sixteenth to win going away. HADLEY MARI
saved ground setting the pace, was unable to resist the winner late but continued on well for the place in a game effort. AMERICAN CULTURE was allowed
to settle in stride, moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole but lacked the needed late response. WINNING ATTITUDE saved ground
while being unhurried early and finished in a mild rally. MISS TRICKY INDY dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
ROCKETT'S RED CITY was forwardly placed to the stretch from along the inside, drifted out and gave way. ANGEL OF MY EYE saved ground while
lacking early speed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
GOSPEL DANDY saved ground setting the pace, turned back a bid from No Huddle nearing the eighth pole and won drawing clear. NO HUDDLE stalked
the pace racing in hand, moved up to offer a bold bid entering the stretch, could not match strides with the winner late but was clearly second best. CHA
CHING CHARLIE was forward placed while racing three-wide, drifted out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished willingly. WHO'S ON THE RUN
saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, but lacked a rally when called upon. RARE COIN hopped in the air at the start, then was unhurried,
came four-wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. BIGG LIMO failed to seriously threaten while racing three-wide. GOBLIN was not a factor while
saving ground. EIGHT MAKAR was bumped and pinched back at the start and failed to menace. WHISKEY THERAPY broke out and bumped Eight Makar
at the start and showed little thereafter.
