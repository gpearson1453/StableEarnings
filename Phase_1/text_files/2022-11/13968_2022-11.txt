Footnotes
CARTE BLANCHE pressed the pace while keen outside of PRINCE OF MAYHEM, headed that foe past the nine sixteenths, cleared in the three path on the
far turn, was urged in upper stretch, drifted out under a drive and held. YAK tracked the leading pair outside of JUST GUN IT around the first turn, tracked
the leading pair down the back straight, was pushed along in the four path to chase CARTE BLANCHE on the far turn, was driven into the lane in the three
to four path, was carried out as CARTE BLANCHE drifted, kept on chasing to the finish but was ultimately held at bay. TALLESTOFTHETALL raced in the
rear pair inside of UNBROKEN SONG, continued in the two to three path inside of that foe around the far turn, raced two wide in upper stretch between
horses, brushed with UNBROKEN SONG and nonetheless outfinished that one for the show. UNBROKEN SONG raced in the rear pair outside of
TALLESTOFTHETALL, continued in the rear pair in the four to five path on the far turn, raced three wide between horses in upper stretch, brushed with
TALLESTOFTHETALL while chasing on and was outfinished by that foe for the show. JUST GUN IT tracked the leading pair inside of YAK through the
clubhouse turn, chased the leading trio down the back straight, raced toward the rear in the four path on the far turn, raced into the lane four wide and
lacked the needed rally. PRINCE OF MAYHEM set a pressured pace inside of CARTE BLANCHE, was headed just past the nine sixteenths, weakened in
the two path on the far turn, and had no more inside in the lane.

Footnotes
PERFECT WAGER tracked just off the leaders along the inside to the backstretch, tipped out three deep nearing upper stretch, then continued with a
steady bid outside VITALE to just edge that foe in time under firm left handed encouragement. The latter was urged prompting the pace outside a rival into
the backstretch, pressed the issue gaining a narrow advantage racing into the far turn, edged clear while shifting to the inside racing into upper stretch, then
grudgingly resisted the winner's bid while just failing to contain that rival. PISTOL BOX settled off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch,
shifted out racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to gain position between foes late. STAGE DOOR broke inwards bumping the eventual
winner, was urged along the inside disputing the pace into the backstretch, pressed the issue into the far turn, lost ground to the pacesetter into the stretch,
then ducked out in late stages while giving way. HONEST TO GOODNESS, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, switched outside foes on the far
turn, was fanned five wide in the stretch and made no impact. JOLTING JOE tracked off the first flight outside a rival for a half and steadily faded into the far
turn. DRAMATIC KITTEN was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch but retreated early.

Footnotes
BRAVO BRAVO raced midfield early, drifted back to the rear near the five eighths, raced inside of MOVE ON OVER in the rear pair in the two to three path
on the turn, improved into the lane, sustained the rally under a drive between horses, kept on through the final furlong, drifted out a few paths but
nonetheless reeled in the leader late. JACK VAN BERG broke out sharply and bumped D' YANK, set a pressured pace inside of ROAD BIBLE, edged clear
in the two to three path on the turn, edged further clear under his own power in upper stretch, but tired late and was caught. TIME HEIST tracked the leading
pair inside of D' YANK, chased the leading pair in the two path on the turn, was driven in the two to three path in upper stretch, chased on, proved no match
for JACK VAN BERG in the final sixteenth but kept on for show. D' YANK was pushed in at the break by JACK VAN BERG and bumped MOVE ON OVER,
tracked the leading pair outside TIME HEIST, raced between horses past the five eighths, continued between horses in the five path on the turn, came five
wide into the lane and chased on mildly. ROAD BIBLE broke sharply in and soundly bumped MOVE ON OVER in the opening strides, pressed the pace
outside of JACK VAN BERG, tracked the leader in the four to five path on the turn, came three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the leader and
weakened. MOVE ON OVER was bumped hard by ROAD BIBLE and D' YANK at the break and took back, settled at the rear, raced outside of BRAVO
BRAVO in the three to four path on the turn, was driven four to five wide in the lane and had no rally. NAUGHTY ALFRED was shut off at the start, raced at
the rear early but advanced to midfield near the five eighths, raced in the six path around the turn with the chasing flight, was driven six wide in upper stretch
and came up empty.

Footnotes
JIM AND JIM ducked out sharply at the start while getting away a step slowly, tracked off the second flight on the backstretch, switched out four wide racing
through the turn commencing a steady advance, then continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage in time under firm right handed
encouragement. HURTS SO BAD tracked just off the leaders along the inside through the backstretch, shifted out three wide on the turn to bid between foes
racing into upper stretch, struck the front midstretch but proved only second best. ROCKET MAN ATTACK angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival
in the opening stages, dueled for command inside the top pair into upper stretch and gave out leaving the furlong marker. SMOOTH ATTACK tracked off the
first flight three deep in the opening stages, then continued evenly off the inside racing into the stretch. ANUNKA made brief pursuit of the leaders between
foes and gave way racing into the turn. INSIDE THE CIRCLE was urged inside rivals disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn and gave way
into upper stretch. UNCLE DICK was settled outside a rival dropping well off the leaders on the backstretch, angled five wide entering the stretch but proved
no threat. LELAND JOHN broke slowly and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SWISHAWISH chased the leading pair early between horses while a bit keen, saved ground while tracking in the pocket on the turn, was asked inside into
the lane, altered outside of DUST DANCER approaching the three sixteenths and bulled past GHAALEB'S HONOR, engaged outside of SWISHAWISH
midstretch, wrested the lead at the sixteenth and edged past. DUST DANCER was sent for speed up the inside and cleared, set the pace in the two path on
the turn while prompted by GHAALEB'S HONOR, outkicked that foe into the lane, was confronted by SWISHAWISH midstretch, tried to maintain the lead,
but grudgingly ceded the lead to that foe near the sixteenth and chased on second best. HELA chased the leading pair four wide early and in the four path
around the turn outside of TUFF ATTACK, raced four wide into the lane, and chased on willingly to prove best of the rest. GHAALEB'S HONOR tracked the
pacesetter down the back straight, prompted the pace in the three path on the turn, came three wide into upper stretch while outkicked by DUST DANCER,
was grazed by SWISHAWISH as he bulled past near the three sixteenths, and gradually flattened. DEMAND RANSOM tracked the leading pair inside early,
settled back toward the rear in the three path on the turn, came three wide into the lane and chased on without mustering the needed late kick. MISTER
CHARMING settled in the rear pair down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, was taken six wide into the lane but lacked the needed rally.
TUFF ATTACK chased the leading pair three wide between horses early, chased in the three path on the turn inside of HELA, swung five wide into the lane
and flattened. DASTARDLY DEEDS broke awkwardly, settled at the rear, hugged the rail on the turn, swung four wide into the lane and came up empty.

Footnotes
MAGIC CASTLE broke sharply to gain a narrow advantage in the opening stages, dueled for command inside a rival into the turn, kicked clear racing past
midstretch and extended the advantage late under firm left handed pressure. IMPRESSED tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight racing to the
bend, advanced four wide into upper stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors. BRING ME A CHECK, off a step slowly, was
prompted to position between foes in second flight, shifted out three wide to bid between foes midstretch but was outkicked for second. LATIN CASINO was
urged forcing the pace outside the eventual winner through the backstretch into the turn, dueled into upper stretch and gave out leaving the furlong marker.
LAUDA SPEED was urged to a forward position racing just off the leaders inside rivals, tipped off the inside racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed
kick while racing in close quarters. TURBINADO dropped out early.

Footnotes
CHICKS DIG SCARS broke sharply but was taken back behind MOTO MOTO near the five eighths, tracked in the pocket down the rest of the backstretch,
chased the leading pair in the three path on the turn, swung five wide into the lane, rallied well, took the lead past the furlong mark and kicked away under a
drive. NAVY SEAL raced inside of W W CANDY at the rear of the main group early, raced in the four path at the rear of the main group on the turn, began to
improve near the three eighths, came three wide into the lane, shifted out further under a drive, found his best near the sixteenth, and gained well late
between horses. TETSU chased three deep between horses on the back straight, chased two wide on the turn, swung five wide into the lane, ran on
willingly to the finish but was narrowly outkicked inside of NAVY SEAL for the place. W W CANDY broke outward and bumped GOLDEN HORNET in the
opening strides, raced two wide at the rear of the main group early, continued in the four to five path near the rear of the main pack on the turn, began to
improve near the three eighths, swung out six wide for the stretch run, found his best too late and missed the place. GOLDEN HORNET was pinballed
between W W CANDY and MOTO MOTO in the opening strides, tracked the pacesetter down the backstretch, engaged outside of MOTO MOTO and
dueled in the three to four path on the turn, floated three wide into the lane, continued to vie with MOTO MOTO to midstretch, could not hold off CHICKS
DIG SCARS to his outside inside the eighth pole and flattened out in the final sixteenth. MOTO MOTO broke inward and bumped GOLDEN HORNET in the
opening strides, was sent for pace, led down the back straight, was engaged by GOLDEN HORNET into the turn and dueled inside that foe while racing in
the two to three path, had a narrow lead in upper stretch, continued to vie to midstretch, had no answer for CHICKS DIG SCARS midstretch and weakened
in the final sixteenth. HIDE THE DEMON raced toward the rear of the main flight early, saved ground midfield along the rail on the turn, took closer order
inside in upper stretch while still inside, but weakened in the final furlong. OMAHA RED chased between horses early, raced in the two to three path on the
turn, began to flatten out near the three eighths, and had no more two wide in the lane. SILVER SEEKER chased four deep down the back straight,
continued midfield four wide on the turn, floated five wide into the lane and came up empty. MKAR THE FAST was reluctant to load, trailed down the
backstretch and in the five path on the turn, lagged four wide into the lane and offered no bid.

Footnotes
LINDALOUIMAGE was prompted to contend from the break, then was held up avoiding close quarters nearing the first turn, tracked the leaders three deep
in the second flight through the backstretch, made a steady advance in that path on the far turn to challenge for command in upper stretch and prevailed
under firm encouragement. ASKEW, urged to dictate the pace along the inside on a narrow margin from the outset to the far turn, dueled for command while
shifting out racing into the stretch but proved only second best. PRESENT OF HERO, reserved along the inside in the opening half, switched out racing into
upper stretch and produced a steady late response to gain position between foes while prevailing for a share. BEING CREATIVE, off slowly, was rated
between foes off the second flight to the backstretch, shifted out four wide while being urged to advance to contention nearing upper stretch, drifted inwards
racing through the stretch and flattened out late. SHE TAKES FLIGHT, in touch with the leader attending the pace under light reserve to the backstretch,
briefly pressed the issue on the far turn but came up empty in late stages. BEZEL SET settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and never gained
contention. AIKEN TO BE TAKIN tracked the leaders between foes in second flight for five furlongs and emptied out racing into upper stretch. HOOSIER
GOLD CASE tracked the leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight, faded from contention after a half, dropped out last into the stretch, was pulled up
in the lane and vanned off the course following the race.
