Footnotes
MIT MAZEL set the pace racing in hand, drifted out slightly entering the stretch, responded when challenged and maintained a safe advantage. PEYTON
ELIZABETH saved ground stalking the pace, slipped through entering the stretch to offer a bold bid but was unable to get by the winner in a game try.
BEHIND THE COUCH prompted the pace from along the outside, was three-wide entering the stretch and finished well in a good effort. NO MORE MASK
bobbled at the start, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole and then weakened slightly late. TWELVEO'CLOCKROCK dropped back
early while saving ground, slipped through during the drive but failed to seriously threaten. PEACE OUT was reserved off the early pace, came three-wide
into the stretch and faded.

B WEST set the pace racing in hand, drew off when roused and won as much the best. HERE'S LIAM hopped in the air at the start, then was reserved off
the early pace while racing two-wide and finished well for the place in a steady effort. CALIFORNIA GHOST saved ground stalking the pace, could no
threaten the winner but continued finished well for the show. ARROGANT RIDER dropped back early, swung out to come five-wide into the stretch and
finished in a mild rally. ALVY prompted the pace for six furlongs and weakened. INSPIRED IRISH was forwardly placed form the start, moved up four-wide
to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole and then flattened out.

Footnotes
RAISE A SPEIGHTS dueled for the lead between foes from the outset while racing two-wide, gained a slime lead near the sixteenth marker, had his rider
lost the whip late and proved narrowly best. APPRAISAL moved up three deep to dispute the pace before going a quarter mile, dueled with the winner from
that point but wasn't quite good enough in a game effort. HIGHLAND DREAM vied for the lead to the stretch from along the inside and weakened slightly
during the drive. ROYAL SPY was allowed to settle in stride early, waited near the three furlong marker, angled out and moved up between horses on the
turn while three-wide and finished in a mild rally. SMARTY JOHN steadied at the break, fought restraint and pulled his way forward, stalked the pace while
racing slightly removed from the rail, angled out to come five-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally when called upon. SPRING THE BEAST stumbled at the
start, then raced four-wide on the turn and finished willingly. SWEET ASTA dropped back early, rallied six-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late.
AXXERATOR was unhurried early, moved up between horses on the turn and failed to seriously threaten. AMICALOLA FALLS bobbled at the stat, then
moved up along the inside to be prominent for a half mile and weakened. MIDNIGHT TEQUILA settled in the middle of the pack while racing four-wide and
was not a factor. CHAUFFEUR gave way after showing brief speed while racing three-wide.

Footnotes
BODE'S HERITAGE stalked Grass Cutter while racing in hand, moved up to engage that one nearing the quarter pole, opened a clear lead entering the
stretch and was kept to task too maintain a safe advantage. THENCOMEMORNING was never far back, rallied three-wide into the stretch and was getting
to the winner late. DUNDER BOSS was allowed to settle in stride, rallied four-wide into the stretch, angled in during the drive and was gaining late.
WAVERLEY was reserved off the pace, came five-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. GRASS CUTTER saved ground setting the pace to
near the stretch and weakened. ONE CLEAR MOMENT was off slow, came five-wide into the stretch and improved his position. JACKIE'S QUEST was
forwardly placed along the inside for a half mile and tired. BLONDE SAMARITAN raced in the middle of the pack while between horses and faded. WICKED
KITTEN was in tight on the turn while racing along the inside and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
JEBSTER prompted the pace from along the outside, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and won drawing clear. MOSES WATER saved ground setting
the pace, was unable to resist the winner during the drive but continued on well for the place. IMAGINE IT ALL was unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the
stretch and was gaining ground late. SLOE GIN BIZ was forwardly placed while racing between horses but lacked a rally when asked. HE ROLLS saved
ground while being reserved off the early pace and failed to threaten. GRAND MANNER veered out sharply at the start, then moved up three-wide on the
turn to reach contention but flatted out during the drive.
