Footnotes
WRAPPINJUSTICE chased the pace from the three path down the backstretch, bid three wide into the far turn, cleared in mid-turn, continued to extend the
advantage into the lane then widened through the final eighth while being kept to the task. SEQUEEKER was steadied early when put in tight, climbed to the
first turn while trailing the field, continued in the back into the far turn, gained momentum in late turn while moving from the two to the four path, came into
the lane from the five path and finished with good energy to moved up. GIODORABLE set the pace along the inside down the backstretch, yielded to the
winner entering the far turn then lost ground to that one while staying on for the show spot. RUBY SKY was in the two or three path through the turn and into
the lane an never factored. IMA N H LADY CAT was done after mid-turn when along the inside. VENYATTA pressed the pace two wide into the far turn,
continued to chase the top ones through the far turn then was empty into the lane.

the pace along the inside through the turn, came off the inside into the lane when gaining momentum, inched up while in the three or four path, drifted from
the four to the seven path late while gaining to the end. HOOSIER PREMIUM set the pace through the turn while under pressure from the winner, yielded to
that one outside the eighth pole, kept on well through the final sixteenth and lost the place spot late. LITTLE ACCOUNT never a factor while along the
inside. SHINY SHOES was off a step slow to trail the field at once, continued towards the back while in the two path through the turn and was never in it.

Footnotes
ASSIDUOUSLY (GB) was unhurried while along the inside, moved up on vacated rail through the turn to get near the leaders, was patiently ridden through
late turn, tipped into the three path into the lane, quickly gained momentum while straightening, captured the lead soon after the eighth pole and drew away.
BIG PAPER saved ground into mid-turn, angled sharply from the rail to the five path entering the lane, moved up to chase the winner and settled for second
best. TIZ OF THEE chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid four wide through late turn, dropped closer to the inside into the lane, gained a
short and brief lead outside the eighth pole, was no match for the winner but ended well clear for the show spot. GO NUTS saved ground through the turns
and into the lane, shifted into the four path late and was never a threat. CONTRACTOR BILL chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid three
wide after mid-turn, gained a short lead through late turn then gave way while straightening in the lane. SARGEANT BARGER was in the four to five path
through the turns and into the lane and tired. BEAR FORCE set the pace early, was under pressure into the far turn, continued close up into the lane then
was empty. MR. CUNNINGHAM pressed the pace two wide into the turn then was done near mid-turn.

Footnotes
ONE EYED JOHNNY dueled inside, gave way late on the turn, then came back late in time by the narrowest of margins. SHOOTER JUSTICE dueled
outside of the winner, drew off in the stretch but was caught at the wire. CASPER JUSTICE stalked the pace in the four path, bid late and missed. DOSSIER
raced in the three path, rallied late and just missed the show spot. GO RODNEY saved ground to no avail. MYDADSBETRTHANYURS raced three wide
and closed late. CAN'T SAY ELLY MAE saved ground to no avail. SHINEONBRAD was through early.
