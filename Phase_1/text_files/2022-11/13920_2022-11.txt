seventy yards from the start and finished clear for second. TRADEOFF away alertly, set a pressured pace inside rivals through the far turn, drifted to the five
path, gave up the lead at the furlong marker then was outfinished. LEND AMERICA failed to menace. RAL COPPERHEADROAD stalked the early pace,
moved closer three wide on the far turn then came up empty. STAYIN OR STRAYIN pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then gave way. THE

ICON pressed the pace along the inside in the four path, surged to the front with a quick move entering the far turn then widened the balance of the trip to
win as much the best while taken in hand late. GOLD HERITAGE allowed to settle, rallied through the stretch in the five path and finished well clear for
second while no match for the winner. DAWN WEST saved ground and finished the best of rest. FOLLOW YOUR DREAM broke in front, set the pace off
the rail in the five path into the far turn then weakened in the stretch. DOWN TO BIZZNESS close up early in the six path was through after a half.

TIGER TRAIL dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch, gained command then finished full of run under confident handling to win going away. JOES A
ROCKIN tracked the leader in the five path into the turn, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole then was no match for the winner but held on for
second. STONE COLD CAT never far back, finished with good courage two wide. MOBIL AT LAST unhurried early, swung wide and closed some ground
late in the seven path. ONE CRAZY RIDE close up into the stretch, faded late. NAMBITI battled for the lead along the inside to the top of the stretch then
weakened. HEIDI'S SINATRA trailed.

Footnotes
TOMATO BILL set the pace two wide around the clubhouse turn, gave up the advantage, came on again to regain the lead entering the stretch and drew off
late under brisk handling. BAJAN RUM stalked the pace near the inside into the stretch, angled out to the seven path then rallied to be clear for second.
ANGEL'S ENTRY unhurried early, swung wide and had a mild late rally in the middle of the racetrack. BLAME IT ON EDDIE pressed the early pace along
the inside, made the lead entering the backstretch, set the pace to the top of the stretch then weakened. WISE KHOZAN broke slowly, settled mid pack
outside then failed to respond. STRIKE A BEAT failed to menace. SAVING MAMA was outrun. ZALINSKY had brief speed.

HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE had speed from the start six wide, chased the pace into the stretch, dug in under left handed urging and got up in the final strides.
CLIFTONS BALLERINA split horses five wide to make the lead after a quarter, edged clear on the turn, set the balance of the pace then couldn't handle the
winner. BOOGIE BOOGEE vied for the lad four wide and went evenly. PENNY SHOTS battled for the early lead two wide, had speed into the stretch then
faded. HEIDI'S BACK contested the early lead along the inside and weakened on the turn. DRUMBEG was no factor. PISTOL PACKIN BOS battled for the
early lead three wide, had speed for a half then weakened. LACY QUEEN had brief speed.

Footnotes
IT'S A MANS WORLD chased the pace into the stretch, rallied under left handed urging to make the lead before the furlong marker and edged clear under
strong handling. KONTAR allowed to settle, swung wide, rallied through the stretch in the six path and got up for second. THIS MAN CAN sprinted to a clear
lead soon after the start, set the pace into the stretch then was outfinished. BUCKEYE RUCKUS failed to menace. THE MAN CAN well placed, failed to
respond. OFTEN ENOUGH hit the gate at the start and was no factor. QUALITY MAN was no threat. PLATE IT UP had brief speed. CAPTAIN RILEY
trailed.
