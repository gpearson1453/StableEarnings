Footnotes
GOOD ONE unhurried to the turn, split horses quarter pole cleared, lasted. DUEL FUEL close to the leaders, rallied in earnest stretch run too late.
RETALIATED pressed pace three wide to the turn, stayed game for show spot. CALL WEST bobble at the start, no speed to the turn with a late run
improve. SOUTHERN SAVIOUR saved ground throughout with a stretch, late bid, faltered late. TOPPING inside speed to the turn, dueled stretch,
weakened final stages. AIRWAR inside run to the turn, never a real menace. TOP CREDENTIALS slight bobble start, never threatened. MR. WALSH
hounded leader between horses to turn, gave way readily. ANYTIMEALLTHETIME stumbled at the start, went wrong past the quarter pole, took a bad step
and fell while vanned off following the finish.
