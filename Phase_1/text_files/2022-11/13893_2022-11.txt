FOOT RUB LOVE chassed the pace while two wide through the turn and between rivals, bid three wide and between rivals through the lane, inched to the
lead an eighth out then stayed on well to hold the runner-up safe. MY DARK SECRET was along the inside through the turn when never far back, angled
into the six path for the drive then steadily gained on the top one and missed while second best. HOHOHOHO raced three wide through the turn while never
far back, swung into the lane from the five path, bid outside the eighth pole, was on near even terms with the winner just inside the eighth pole then could
not sustain the effort. E STREET ANGEL hopped at the start and trailed the field down the backstretch, raced in the four path through the turn when gaining
momentum, swung into the lane six wide and in the seven or eight path, loomed a serious threat with an eighth to go then could not sustain the bid. SHAPE
OF YOU pressed the pace along the inside through mid-turn, continued near the inside into the lane and weakened. JE SUIS BELLE vied for the early lead
into the turn, cleared through mid-turn and into the lane then gave way when collared while straightening in the lane.

SILVER MOON ROAD vied for the early lead while two wide, cleared soon after entering the turn, continued on a clear lead through the turn and into the
lane and slowly widened while being kept to the task. DOUBLE ADVANTAGE chased the winner through the turn while in the three path, continued in the
four path through the lane, was no match for the winner while clearly second best. TOUCHOFCHILIPEPPER vied for the lead along the inside into the turn,
continued along the inside while losing ground to the top two through the lane but lasted for the show spot. HIGHEST PRAISE was never a factor while
along the inside. TAOS raced in the three path through the turn when behind the top three and tired after entering the lane. ANYTIMEALLTHETIME was

through the far turn, briefly dueled with the runner-up while straightening in the lane then gamely held and inched up late to be clear at the wire. HOT DAME
pressured the winner two wide through the turn and into the lane, bid while straightening in the lane, looked a serious threat near the three-sixteenths pole

the top one while finishing best of the rest. RESURRECTION ROAD was in the three path through the far turn when never far back then weakened after
entering the lane. QUEEN CHARMAINE was along the inside through the turns and tired after entering the lane. TALK RADIO raced in the four path through

Footnotes
EKATI FLATTER bumped around at the start, moved up to stalked the pacesetters while in the three path, bid three wide into the lane, gained the lead
outside the eighth pole, then gamely held. FLAT OUT CALI chased the three leading rivals through the turn while in the three path, bid into the lane from the
four path, continued with good energy through the final eighth and was gaining to the end. CASTLE MAGIC was bumped at the start, moved to press the
leader through mid-turn, continued three wide through the lane and was inching up to the end. SHARON'S GREY HOPE saved ground through the turn and
into the lane, rallied along the rail until late, came off the inside late to split rivals and finished willingly. B FLAT OUT set the pace along the inside through
the turn and into the lane then yielded to the top ones late. CRICKENBERGER was in the three path through the turn and into the lane then gained
belatedly. ICEY ANGEL was in the three to the two path through the turn and turned in an even effort. BICARB BETTY was in the four path through the turn,
came into the lane from the five path and lacked a response. TEAKETTLE was in the two path through the turn and into the lane and never was a factor
while gaining belatedly. JANTIVA trailed throughout while in the four path through the turn.

Footnotes
SELENA SING stalked the pace in the four path, bid at the quarter pole, dueled late and then held off the closer under a steady drive. RACEDAY ATTIRE
stalked the pace in the five path, bid in early stretch, dueled late outside and was outfinished. CROSSED THE LINE raced in the five path and had no late
bid. ADMIRAL'S GARNET dueled outside of a foe before giving way in the stretch. SUMMER HOME dueled inside before giving way in the stretch.
HOPPESTRY saved ground to no avail. JERSEY GOLD was off awkwardly. LUCKYWISE was not a factor. ESTILO DIFERENTE stalked the early pace
inside, raced in the three path around the turn and faltered in the drive. PRINCESS D'ORO trailed.
