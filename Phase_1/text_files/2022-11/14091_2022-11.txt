Footnotes
FAR HEART quickly moved to the lead off inside then pulled away through the stretch under moderate urging. MAGNOLIA ROAD stalked the winner three
wide then continued well to win the head bob for the place. CASH ON FIRST raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, moved inside in the stretch and
flattened out. CHARLY'S CHOO CHOO steadied between rivals early then was never a factor. GOVERNMENT GIRL trailed far behind then caught fading
rivals. CHARLYS WILD ANGEL saved ground within range briefly then gave way readily. LOVE CHANNEL chased wide and stopped abruptly losing contact
with her field.

Footnotes
HIGH VELOCITY showed sharp early speed, opened up a long lead, showed the way on his own, responded to some urging passing the furlong marker
and was ridden out. THE RIGHT PATH raced off the pace, chased between rivals on the turn and rallied for second. WHAT'S TO BLAME raced four wide
off the pace, chased three wide on the turn, rallied mildly and earned the show spot. FARLEY tracked on the inside, chased on the turn and weakened.
BOAT OVER THE HILL raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. RELISHMENT was outrun early, moved up three wide at the quarter pole and failed
to threaten. DRONE SWARM raced off the pace and did not factor. PETULANT DELIGHT was fractious in the warm up, then raced three wide off the pace
and gave way.

dueling pacesetters and went evenly late. RUNNIN JOKE trailed early then passed rivals without menacing. LIDIA'S PRAYER outrun throughout, moved
inside on the turn and faded. SECRET ADDICTION forced the pace three wide between foes and gave way. TAKEMETOTHEMOON broke sluggishly and

SPIKEZONE quickly pulled clear, repelled a challenge in the stretch and stayed safe under steady encouragement. FOR THE DREAMERS raced in closest
pursuit of the pacesetter, loomed a stretch threat and continued gamely. MR SANDMAN chased off the leaders three wide, angled inside on the turn then
flattened out. CELTIC HEART dropped far behind in the opening quarter then showed some late energy. A DANGEROUS GUY lacked speed inside down
the backstretch and gave way. IRISH EXIT faded on the turn and was never in contention. TANKINATOR prompted the pace three wide to the turn and
stopped.
