Footnotes
RAKU FIRING sped clear early moving off to upper stretch building a commanding lead there being ridden out. GOTTAGETITBACK chased a loose leader
to upper stretch proving no match there while salvaging place. AS DE ORO COCO chased a loose leader through the turn being dispatched into upper
stretch weakening late. WHISKEY SUNRISE raced evenly throughout lacking more. ACTING PRINCE played no factor. HURRICANE JAKE was always
outrun. MAJESTIC JOHN'S was well back throughout.
