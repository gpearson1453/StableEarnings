Footnotes
STAR LUCK was sent to lead from the three path, was coaxed from the four path turning into the lane, dug in and held on gamely. TOP BOSS pressed in
the three path, bid from the five path going into the stretch, and ran on but hung in the final furlong to place. JEEZUM JIM tracked between rivals, was in
hand while looking for room around the turn, found room inside and was cued from the two path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. YABBA DABBA
DUDE chased in the four path, took aim from the six path going into the stretch, and stayed on. MR. WALSH rated from the five path, was roused from the
seven path entering the lane, but was one paced. CLASSY SOLUTION trailed from the two path into the stretch and was never a threat. W W SPRINGTIME
prompted the pace from inside early but gave way around the turn.

Footnotes
SO THERE solo leader around the first turn, nice easy tempo into far turn, headed by outside rival leaving the quarter pole, fought off challenger, went clear
under a drive. GANDHI'S ORION stalked the leader from the start, always in range took a brief lead nearing the quarter pole, could not sustain bid, finished
willingly to the wire. HAY DIDDLE DIDDLE raced off the pace early on, steady progress along the inside into second turn, closed the gap late, never a threat
to winner. LIGHT WORK raced off the pace and four wide into far turn, no late kick. DON CICCIO inside and off the pace first turn, moved up between
runners into second turn, bid stalled through the lane. LUXURY BOY tracked leaders from the three path, lost contact turn, outrun late. COMMITTED rated
back soon after the start, never a factor.
