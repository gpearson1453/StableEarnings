Footnotes
O K GAME ON was reserved early two wide, made a three wide move on the turn, then had a long drive with CHARGING LION and got up late to prove
best under a drive. CHARGING LION pressed the pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to shake clear on the turn, then dug in gamely but was
outfinished late to just miss. BORSA VENTO was fractious prior to loading, then stalked the pace three wide and made a two wide bid on the turn but could
not go with the top two in the stretch while being clearly the best of the rest. CONTRAFLOW set a pressured pace on the inside and gave way. SHOWER
THE PEOPLE passed the tiring rivals. COMPOUND IT was settled early and tired. ROLLING PALISADES was well placed on the inside early and then
stopped.
