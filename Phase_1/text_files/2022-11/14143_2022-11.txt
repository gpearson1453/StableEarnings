Footnotes
KRYPTON stalked the pace four and five wide, took over near the sixteenth pole and drew clear late. ALLAGASH RUN pressed the pace in the four path,
took the lead near the three-eighths marker, drew clear in upper stretch but could not resist the winner in the final sixteenth. TACTICAL FORCE raced off
the pace two and three wide and rallied for the show. LAST DREAM broke awkwardly, saved ground off the pace, angled three wide near the quarter pole,
made progress in upper stretch but flattened out late. DEN STREET was off a step slow, raced five wide and never threatened. STORMY VICTORY dueled
between foes in the three path and faded through the lane. PRINCE FOR A DAY played no factor while racing three and four wide. BAKER BLOCK
exchanged several light bumps with AREVALO in the early stages, rushed up leaving the chute to set a pressured pace in the two path and faltered nearing
the lane. AREVALO exchanged several light bumps with BAKER BLOCK in the early stages, had brief speed, retreated in the five path around the turn and
eased in the lane.

Footnotes
ANOTHERDAYGONEBY stumbled at the start, recovered well to stalk from the three path, ranged up around the turn to bid from the six path into the
stretch, took the lead going into the final furlong and held sway. FEISTY SARA rated in the two path, was driven along while floating out to the seven path
entering the lane, and ran on down the center for place. LE BOIANA chased from inside, was ridden from the five path into the stretch, and kept on for
show. CONCEPTUS set the pace along the inside, was roused midway around the turn and dug in from the three path entering the lane, but flattened out
late. GIRL BYE pressed the pace from two wide but yielded in upper stretch. MISS ARIA trailed throughout from the three path.

Footnotes
A ROSE FOR RAVEN tracked the pace inside around the first turn, angled out early on the backstretch, stalked in the three path from there, put a head in
front nearing the eighth pole, switched back to the left lead and lugged in soon after, straightened on soon after and just lasted. SPEEDY HANS settled off
the early pace in the two path, advanced four wide around the far turn, closed outside and just missed. OVER THE CHANNEL was in range while racing
three and four wide, angled in in upper stretch and rallied inside for the show. MO HAWK set the pace in the two path, yielded near the eighth pole, steadied
when the winner lugged in briefly leaving that marker and had no further bids. CAXAMBAS CANDY saved ground and failed to menace. UNTITLED chase
the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. RUMBLE STRIP RON played no factor while racing two wide. BRYCE CANYON lost contact early, pulled up in
midstretch and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE
ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
TONE FEELIN rated from the two path early, was ridden around the turn while shifting out to the seven path going into the stretch, and rallied while
gradually drifting in to draw clear in the final furlong. SIR AGGRAVATOR prompted the pace from the two path, made an inside move to take the lead
rounding the turn, was cued from the three path into the lane, and ran on but was second best. ONUR (ARG) chased from the six path, took aim while
drifting into the five path in upper stretch, but evened out late to show. EXAMINER was hustled out of the gate to stalk from the five path, was driven from
said position into the lane, was in tight and forced to shift out into the final furlong, but was one paced. VINNIE VAN GO set the pace from the three path but
faded in the stretch. NEW YORK STYLE trailed from the six path into the stretch and was never a threat. CROI MOR tracked in the three path but backed
up around the turn. AN INQUIRY WAS HELD AND OBJECTION WAS MADE BY THE RIDER OF EXAMINER AGAINST THE RIDER OF ONUR FOR
POSSIBLE INTERFERENCE NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE BUT IT WAS DISSALLOWED AND THERE WAS NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
VELOCE BELLA sped to the front, set the pace in the two path and just lasted. THELASTBULLETSMINE chased the winner from the rail, angled three wide
turning for home, closed outside and just missed. ADIOS BABE chased the pace two wide and had a mild rally to gain the show. DREAMING OF AUDREY
saved ground off the pace and lacked the needed rally. CLAUDETTE HEIR failed to menace while racing three wide. SPANISH DELIGHT played no factor
while racing four wide. CHITIENNE chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. SHEZA SPITFIRE hesitated at the start to get away at least
three lengths behind the field and trailed inside.

MISTER ABARRIO chased from four wide early, moved up to take the lead while three wide around the far turn, opened up into the lane, weaved though
the stretch, and just held on. LEAVENWORTH steadied between rivals into the first turn, rated in the six path, was roused to take aim from four wide around
the far turn, and ran on in the stretch for place. GUSTAVOR stalked from the three path, was roused while shifting out to the five path into the lane, and kept
on for show. ST IGNACIO was bumped after the start, raced in midpack from the four path, was hustled from the six path into the stretch, but finished
evenly. SWAN LAKE prompted the pace from inside early, was ridden three wide around the far turn, but was one paced through the lane. NIKKI NOOTS
tracked from the four path but flattened down the stretch. SPY TOWN raced from wellback in the five path, had to steady midway down the backstretch, was
bumped by an inner foe at the top of the stretch, and was no factor. ENGLISH STORM pressed between rivals but yielded around the far turn. SIR GOOSA
led from three wide around the first turn, tucked into the two path down the backstretch, but gaveway around the far turn. HEXAGON always trailed, was
pulled up around the far turn, and walked off.

Footnotes
ARELLA STAR dueled two wide and drew off under a drive in the lane. ONE OF ONE stalked the pace three wide, had aim outside of the winner in upper
stretch but was no match for the that foe. OLGA hit the starting gate, dueled inside of the winner and weakened in the drive. NUCCI was bumped at the start
and again soon after, chased the pace four and five wide and never threatened. JELLYBEAN chased the pace three wide and had no response. MURSAL
was shuffled back early, raced two and three wide and made little impact. KIKILOVE was bumped twice early, raced four wide and played no further factor.

Footnotes
ADMIRAL HOPPER stalked in the two path, was coaxed between rivals entering the lane, and rallied to get up in the closing stages.
LIONESSOFBRITTANY prompted the pace from the five path, was cued to bid turning into the stretch, ran on and led into the final furlong, but drifted out
late and got caught to finish with place honors. MISS SAKAMOTO pressed in the four path, bid from the five path into the lane, and kept on for show. HAY
HAY PAULA had a hesitant start, trailed from the four path early, swung out to the six path entering the stretch, and finished evenly. CAPSTONE GIRL
raced from wellback in the three path, was driven from the five path into the lane, but was one paced. ALICE HARPER tracked from the three path but
flattened down the lane. PERFECT PROVISION set the pace from the two path but gaveway in the stretch. GOLDEN VOICE raced in midpack from the four
path early but was no threat. SAMMY'S TOWN chased from inside but was empty going into the stretch.

Footnotes
SUMMER ASSAULT settled off the pace while racing three and four wide, came five wide into the lane, closed outside while drifting in a bit and was up in
deep stretch. BIG DREAMING stalked the pace in the two path, came through inside of foes to take the lead near the sixteenth pole and was narrowly
outkicked. TANGO TANGO TANGO pressed the pace two wide, took the lead early on the far turn, led to the sixteenth pole and held on well enough to
preserve the show. YAMATO saved ground off the pace and lacked the needed stretch rally. LURE HIM IN settled off the early pace while racing three wide,
made a middle move three between foes, reached near even terms around the far turn and weakened in the lane. SAND DANCER trailed early, angled four
wide midway around the first turn, advanced outside down the backstretch, reached near even terms midway around the far turn but failed to sustain the bid
in the lane. SIR OLLIE set the pace inside and faltered around the far turn.

Footnotes
CLAY SOLDIER tracked the pace from two wide, moved up to bid entering the lane, led into the final furlong and drew clear. ACTION ROSE was held up
while three wide, took aim while being ridden along from four wide into the stretch, and ran on between rivals for to get up late for place. LIVE LIKE LAURA
set the pace from inside, drifted out to the six path entering the lane, and evened out in the final furlong to finish with show honors. VALIANT SHI SHI rated
in the three path, was ridden along while shifting out to the six path going into the stretch, and was gaining late. THAT'S MY CAT stalked from inside but
was one paced in the stretch. AVATAL HERO prompted the pace while four wide but faded in the stretch. AWESOME MARINA raced from wellback in the
four path and never factored. MY MICROBURST had a slow start, trailed into the stretch, and was no menace. GRAYSONSTUFRIENDLY pressed from two
wide but yielded in the stretch. OASIS JAK had a slow start, chased from five wide but was empty in the stretch.
