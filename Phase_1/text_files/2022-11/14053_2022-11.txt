Footnotes
MALIBU COAST stalked in the two path outside a rival, took aim three then two wide on the far turn, rallied in the lane while floated out by HORACE MANN
and drove past late. HORACE MANN prompted the pace from outside to the far turn, took over late n the far turn, disposed of CASTLEKNOCK in upper
stretch, drifted out in the final furlong and could not hold off MALIBU COAST late. KID AZTECA pulled on the inside early near the back, went between foes
on the far turn, spun three wide into the lane and gained the show. TOP OF MY GAME stalked on the inside through both turns, moved out in the lane and
could not rally. CASTLEKNOCK set the pace from inside under pressure to the quarter pole, lost command leaving the turn and retreated in the stretch run.
MARDUKAS got put in tight between rivals early and dropped to last, steadied briefly into the first turn in the two path, went three deep into the far turn,
entered the lane four wide and weakened.

Footnotes
NEXT REVOLT pressed the pace from outside, lost a bit of ground to the leader into the turn, quickly re-engaged and took over at the quarter pole, put
away SHADY EMPIRE in upper stretch and drew away under right handed urging. JOE DON LOONEY bumped leaving the gate, stalked the pace from
inside into the turn, angled three wide around the turn, put in a mild bid in upper stretch but was no match for NEXT REVOLT in the final furlong. BLACK
STORM bumped with inner rival at the start, unhurried after then moved closer outside rivals, traveled three wide around the turn and summoned a mild rally
to edge rival for the show honors. SHADY EMPIRE bumped with JOE DON LOONEY at the start, set the pace with NEXT REVOLT alongside up the
backstretch, inched ahead into the turn then was pressured again around the bend, lost command at the quarter pole, stayed on to upper stretch, then
flattened and got nailed for the show. NEW EAGLE chased two wide under coaxing into and around the turn, asked left handed leaving the bend and failed
to respond. ITALIANO away quickly then settled on the inside, swung four wide into the stretch and failed to menace. HEARTFULLOFSTARS bumped at
the start then lost his path shortly after, trailed three then four wide on the turn and never got involved.

Footnotes
READY SOUL stepped to the front quickly and moved inside, showed the way up the backstretch inside COAST OF ROAN, met a trio of bids at the
three-eighths pole, moved clear around the far turn, drew away in upper stretch and stayed clear under right handed urging and strong handling. MOODY
JIM (IRE) settled on the inside early, went two wide outside a rival into the far turn, angled five wide past the quarter pole, finished willingly while drifting
inward, gained the place but could not threaten the winner. LUVLUV brushed with HAWK OF WAR at the start, traveled in the two path outside a rival at the
back, bid four deep into the far turn, could not sustain the challenge and chased the winner four wide through the far turn, churned on down the lane and
saved the show. HAWK OF WAR brushed leaving the gate, stalked two wide early, bid three deep with three furlongs remaining, could not keep up with the
winner around the far turn, chased three wide into the lane and got edged for third. CLAYTON DELANEY stalked the pace on the inside, cut the corner into
the lane and could not rally. COAST OF ROAN forwardly placed in the begging in the two path, raced outside the leader in the middle stages, pressed
between runners into the far turn, lost contact with the winner and chased two wide into the lane, tired in the stretch run and was eased to the wire,
collapsed following the race and was vanned off.

Footnotes
YOUTEYOURHONOR forwardly placed early on from off the rail, drew alongside the leaders at the seven-sixteenths pole, fought three deep through the
turn, took over past the quarter pole, shook free in upper stretch and drew away under hand urging. CRIMSON ROSE broke a step slow on the inside,
trailed up the backstretch, passed a rival while along the rail into the turn, steered out and came five wide into the stretch, shifted inward midway through the
lane and rallied for the place. EVERLYS GIRL dueled for command inside LAUREL CANYON, took over into the turn, fought with rivals around the bend,
lost the lead past the quarter pole, could not go on with the winner in upper stretch and flattened to third. SHARED FUTURE raced off the rail towards the
rear, got floated out to the six path on the turn and churned on for a minor award. SLAM DIEGO chased two wide leaving the backstretch, eased out to the
four path around the bend and failed to menace. MISS HARD KNOCKS raced in range on the inside into the turn, moved out and came three wide into the
lane and faded. LAUREL CANYON broke out and but was still away quickest, dueled outside EVERLYS GIRL for the early lead, vied between rivals around
the bend, failed to keep up leaving the turn and folded in the stretch.

Footnotes
TOPOLINA sped clear and crossed over to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch, kicked clear in the lane under right handed urged, lugged out in the
final furlong and held safely under hand urging in the last sixteenth. SOCIALLY SMART sat off the pace outside a rival into the turn, angled out at the
quarter pole and came four wide into the drive, bumped with rival in upper stretch, rallied between rivals and bested the rest. DENIM IN GOLD threw her
head at the start and came away slow, trailed to the turn, traveled outside rivals then came five wide into the stretch, bumped with SOCIALLY SMART in
upper stretch, finished determinedly but got edged for the place. REAL FIRE got bumped in the beginning, tracked three deep into the turn, continued three
wide into the lane, kept on through the final furlong but needed to find more late. CUBAN CRISIS (GB) stalked the pace on the inside, drifted out near the
sixteenth pole and weakened. DREAM A DREAM stalked between early, was boxed in from the seven-sixteenths pole to the quarter pole, chased two wide
into the lane, raced between foes in the drive, then got bumped and put in tight quarters at the sixteenth pole and lost any momentum. BEAUTIFUL
TEMPLE stalked three deep early, took aim two wide around the turn, got floated out and bumped at the sixteenth pole and weakened. MAKARA chased
from inside up the backstretch, paused briefly at the three eighths pole, saved ground to the stretch and failed to menace. ONE ARROW bumped leaving
the gate, settled outside rivals early, traveled four deep then steadied between at the quarter pole, entered the lane four to five wide and had little left for the
drive.

Footnotes
MASSIMO pressed SULLY from outside to the turn, dueled around the bend, bumped in upper stretch, took over outside the sixteenth pole and held over
the runner-up. NAVY MAN stalked outside the top pair early, rounded the bend three wide, gave chased and drifted out under left handed urging then switch
to the right hand late and was gaining to the wire. GILMORE chased two wide into the turn, angled four wide around the bend, got floated out by NAVY MAN
in the lane and finished willingly from outside to gained the show. SULLY set the pace from inside under pressure, dueled with MASSIMO around the turn,
bumped with that rival in upper stretch and maintained command into the final furlong, relinquished the lead nearing the sixteenth pole and was overtaken
for the place and show. BLUEGRASS LUTE chased off the pace early on, took the turn two then three wide and came up empty. HARD TIMES raced
greenly in the beginning then was taken out wide on the backstretch, navigated the turn four then three wide and was not a factor. FLAT ON was off slow
and broke inward, began to climb and dropped well back early, trailed two wide then along the rail on the turn and never got involved.

Footnotes
RVALENTINA stepped to the front and controlled the pace on the inside, remained unchallenged into the stretch, put to left handed urging and showed the
way clear into the final sixteenth and was able to hold over the late run from the runner-up. WEEMISSGRAMMY stalked outside rival in the early going,
traveled two then three wide around the second bend, was closest in pursuit through the stretch, put in late bid and could not get by. FOR THE GOOD
TIMES was off slow in the beginning, trailed on the inside then moved out around a rival at the back on the clubhouse turn, roused around the second bend
but lacked room at the quarter pole, traveled along the rail into the lane, steered out in the stretch and finished willingly to whittle the gap on the top pair.
MAJESTIC STEPS (IRE) sat off the pace in the two path, steadied when lacking room past the three-eighths pole, went between rivals then chased two
wide into the drive and improved position. CLASSY stalked along the rail through both turns and never responded when called upon. LIZY D broke inward
then settled inside, asked two wide leaving the far turn, moved out in the lane and could not rally. WITCH MOON raced at the back on the inside then two
wide on the first turn, moved out and was on the move four then three wide on the second bend but came up empty in the drive. SENSIBLE MOVE tracked
three deep around the first turn, dropped back on the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
FUN TO DREAM got bumped and crowded leaving the gate then put in tight quarters again shortly after, chased the speed from off the rail to the turn, bid
three then four wide outside TAMING THE TIGRESS around the bend, got bumped by that rival in midstretch, dueled head to head in the final sixteenth and
dug in to edge the runner-up. TAMING THE TIGRESS took control early and shifted in leaving the chute, cleared at the nine-sixteenths pole, showed the
way in the two path into the turn, met the challenge from FUN TO DREAM around the bend, carried the lead three wide into the lane, drifted out and
bumped midstretch, battled in deep stretch and was bested by the winner. ALL DIALED IN got bumped from inside leaving the gate, crowded between rivals
shortly after then steadied prior to leaving the chute, raced outside ROMAN EMPRESS at the back to the turn, rounded the bend four wide and kept on to
gain the show honors. BIG NOVEL came in and bumped FUN TO DREAM then drifted inward early, stalked on the inside into and around the bend and
faded in the lane. ROMAN EMPRESS bumped ALL DIALED in at the start, shifted in early then checked off the heels of BIG NOVEL, chased on the inside
then two wide into the lane and failed to menace.

Footnotes
BROADWAY GIRLS took control from inside, pressured into the far turn, cleared rival with a quarter mile left to run then drew off under right handed urging
and held safely under steady handling. LA PEER got bumped while along the fence into the first turn, raced in mid-pack up the backstretch, angled out and
exited the far turn three to four wide, got bumped by THREE STRANDS in midstretch and outkicked that rival for second. THREE STRANDS got knocked
into inner rival at the start, traveled two wide then inside near the back, advanced on the inside through the far turn, tipped out into the lane, came out and
bumped LA PEER midstretch and got outclosed for the place honors. BOLTS BABE was closest in pursuit from the two path early on, pressured the winner
into the far turn, failed to keep up with a quarter mile left to run, chased two wide into the drive and flattened to fourth. MOUNT MARY (IRE) bumped with
rival prior to the first turn, moved inside to stalk the pace, given her cue with a quarter mile left to run but failed to find the needed response down the lane.
WINDOW SHOPPING got sandwiched leaving the gate, raced outside a rival towards the rear, found traffic behind rivals on the far turn, angled down to the
rail, tipped out in the drive and went between foes late while unable to threaten. CANDY CARAMEL was fractious in the gate, bumped repeatedly with
JENNIFER'S D'LIGHT early, tracked two wide then between foes into the far turn, asked two then three wide and faltered in the stretch run. JENNIFER'S
D'LIGHT broke in and bumped rival, got bumped by CANDY CARAMEL repeatedly early and took back, traveled three deep off the pace around the
clubhouse turn, got blocked behind a rival near the five-sixteenths pole, chased three wide into the lane and could not make an impact. THE DANCE
BETWEEN bumped between rivals entering the first turn, steadied off heels on the far turn, came two wide into the stretch and lacked a rally.
LUMINIFEROUS bumped leaving the gate, steered down to the inside while at the back, trailed into the far turn, angled four wide around the second bend
and was not a factor. CALIFORNIA BLING was along the three path stalking the pace early, continued three wide into the far turn, started to weaken around
the bend then lugged out leaving the turn and tired.
