Footnotes
BYE BYE BUGGSY came out at the start then sped clear and moved inside, showed the way up the backstretch, challenged by I'M STILL IN IT with three
furlongs remaining, put away that rival past the five-sixteenths pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and stayed strong under right and left handed urging and
steady handling late. I'M STILL IN IT raced up close between early then stalked inside a rival in the middle stages, bid outside BYE BYE BUGGSY at the
three-eighths pole, could not keep up past the five-sixteenths marker, chased the winner through the lane and was clearly second best. CHEEKIEST was off
slow from inside then took back early, trailed to the far turn, tipped out upper stretch and got up for third on the line. ALONG CAME JOANN was a bit green
chasing on the inside into the first turn, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out at the top of the lane and got nailed for the show at the wire. SPANNING THE
GLOBE broke a step slow and bumped outer rival, drifted out on the first turn, inched closer four deep into the second bend, chased two wide into the drive
and weakened. HARD BUT SMART broke slow and got bumped in the beginning, attended the pace three deep around the clubhouse turn then dropped
back a bit to stalk outside a rival, started to back up three wide then trailed two wide on the far turn and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
MENTIROSA pressed the pace from outside up the backstretch, headed rival around the turn, took over into the lane, cleared in upper stretch and drew
away. KING ZOG set the pace under pressure to the turn, headed by MENTIROSA with a quarter mile remaining, lost command into the stretch, could not
stay on with the winner down the lane but was clearly second best. BIG DRINKER was off slow to begin, steadied and drifted out a bit early, chased four
deep on the turn and was along for the show. START THEM UP got a bit fractious in the gate, bumped chasing three deep near the five-sixteenths pole and
failed to rally in the drive. SMOKEM HOWARD broke a bit slow, chased three wide at the back into the turn and improved position. SLIGHTLY DIRTY
bumped outer rival at the start, chased along the rail into the turn, bumped with HOT ROD JIMMY again midway around the turn and could not offer the
needed response after. HOT ROD JIMMY bumped leaving the gate then lost his path early, tugged to a forward position, chased the top pair two wide into
the turn, got bumped between rivals midway around the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
GOOD BOO JOO took control quickly from inside, showed the way under coaxing around the bend, then drew off when asked with the right hand. MAGIC
GAME bumped outer rival at the start, forwardly placed on the inside, took aim two wide into the stretch, could not make any headway on the winner through
the stretch and bested the rest. SHEZMISBEHAVING took a bumped from inside at the start, tracked four then five wide into the stretch and gained the
show. THE BIG CAKE became rank tossing her head about early, bobbled crossing over the dirt, chased along the rail into the turn at the back, lacked room
briefly and steadied nearing the quarter pole, remained inside to the stretch and gained a minor award. FINNLEY'S KITTEN chased two then three wide at
the back around the turn, steered out in upper stretch and could not rally. ROUBAIX raced up close between rivals into the turn, lost ground two wide around
the bend and faded. CHEVY GIRL broke a step slow, drifted out early then moved into range outside rivals, came four wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
FORT BRAGG took a bumped from outside at the start then sprinted to the front, set the pace in hand early, showed the way along the inside to the stretch,
drifted in at the three-sixteenths pole, responded when challenged with a furlong left to run and held gamely. REINCARNATE stalked three wide around
both turns, bid outside the top pair in midstretch but lacked the needed late kick to get by. ODONATA was closest in pursuit from the two path through both
turns, bid outside FORT BRAGG past the eight pole, fought between into deep stretch and faltered late. ALEXANDER HELIOS chased three deep on the
clubhouse turn, remained three wide into the stretch and failed to respond. MY PARTNER GLEN got shuffled between shortly after the start, trailed on the
inside to the far turn, tipped two wide around that bend, moved out in the stretch and could not rally. COSMIC SOUL broke in and bumped the winner,
settled on the inside, saved ground to the stretch and failed to make an impact. HEARTBREAK KID chased two wide between rivals on the first turn, trailed
three wide around the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB) reserved in the early going at the back, moved closer on the inside then went between rivals into the turn, traveled two wide
then steered out in the lane, closed fast from outside and got up in time. LARRY'S LEGEND dueled inside a rival then inched ahead up the backstretch,
maintained command through the turn, cleared in upper stretch, clung to a narrow lead through the final sixteenth but got nailed by the winner on the line.
KING OF SPEED chased outside rivals then two wide into the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, moved out in the lane and kept on willingly for the
show. HE BE MOJO RISIN bobbled crossing over the dirt then chased between early, saved ground around the turn, bid inside the leader in the drive but
faltered in deep stretch. TED pressed the pace from outside into and around the turn, lost contact with the leader in upper stretch and kept on through the
final sixteenth. BUD KNIGHT chased on the inside through the turn and lacked a rally. KANT BEAT THE ROCK raced off the rail near the back, went
between rivals and was on heels at the seven-sixteenths pole, took the turn two wide, tipped out in the drive and could not rally. GEORGE HERMAN RUTH
got crowded down along the inside and altered out early then checked behind KAN BEAT THE ROCK, went three, four, then five wide around the turn and
failed to menace. BOX OF CHOCOLATES traveled three deep off the pace early, spun four wide into the lane, drifted out in upper stretch and lacked the
needed response. GRIT AND CURIOSITY raced four deep off the pace, came six wide into the stretch and also lacked a late response.

Footnotes
CRYPTO MUNNY bothered from inside shortly after the start, tracked out of range, angled out and was on the move through the turn, rallied widest in the
stretch, took over outside the sixteenth pole and won going away. DADSTAR shifted out shortly after the start, sped to the front, led along the rail then two
wide into the stretch, drifted out in upper stretch, yielded to the winner nearing the final sixteenth and held the place. CROSS EXAMINE was off slow to
begin, raced at the back early then moved closer up the backstretch, took the turn two wide, angled inward and summoned a mild rally for the show honors.
WHISKEY VISION sat off the pace, traveled two wide into the turn, angled out around the bend and further out in the stretch and kept on to round out the
superfecta. RAISEDAROOFCHARLIE forwardly placed outside rivals in the early going, traveled wide around the bend and took aim four wide into the
stretch but flattened in the late stages. ASPHALT ANDY got bumped, lost his path and had to take up at the start, lagged behind early, came four wide into
the stretch and kept on to improve position. MEMORANDUM chased inside rivals then outside the leader into the turn, went two to three wide into the
stretch, got crowded between and altered inward. O BROTHER raced off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground into the lane and never made an
impact. RUSTY B CAUSE broke out, chased on the inside into the stretch and tired. MONGOLIAN NINJA broke in and bumped rival at the start, chased off
the rail out of range into the turn, lost ground under a drive around the bend and tired. COLD CITY chased between rivals then got pulled up into the turn
and was vanned off.

Footnotes
DONNER LAKE tracked two wide around the first turn, bid three deep on the far turn, took over outside AGADOR SPARATCUS past the quarter pole,
moved clear in the lane and held gamely over DARK MARCUS in the closing moments. DARK MARCUS unhurried in the early going and steered to the two
path, moved out on the backstretch, steadied into the far turn, was on the move four then three wide on the far turn, put in late bid outside DONNER LAKE
in the final sixteenth but could not get by. TOUCH OF ZEN stumbled leaving the gate, climbed a bit early and from the seven-sixteenths to the far turn,
swung out widest and finished well to earn the show. ORTH was keen early under a hold on the inside then went between on the backstretch, had to pause
off heels at the half-mile pole, waited for room on the far turn, altered in upper stretch and got edged for the show. STREET HUMOR dueled from inside for
command early, chased past the half-mile pole, tipped two wide around tiring rival on the far turn and weakened in the stretch. AGADOR SPARTACUS
raced up close three deep early then went up to taken control past the nine-sixteenths pole, vied two wide then on the inside on the far turn, lost command
past the quarter pole and weakened down the lane. EXCLAMATION dueled outside a rival in the two path early, lost command and pressed the leader from
inside up the backstretch, fought to the five-sixteenths pole, tired and eased in the drive, then walked into the van following the race.

Footnotes
CAUSE SHE'S A LADY bobbled leaving the gate but still came away quickly, attended the pace outside the top pair early, vied for command around the turn
and took over past the five-sixteenths pole, cleared with a quarter mile left to run and drew off under a tap of left handed urging and steady handling.
DRIZELLA tracked five then four wide around the turn, moved out in the lane and bested the rest. NEVER SWAY raced at the back early on, steadied into
the bend then lacked room through the turn, came two wide into the stretch and rallied for the show. ANNA VOLANTE got bumped from inside at the start,
went up to press the pace between rivals, vied for command on the turn, failed to keep up with the winner at the quarter pole and flattened to fourth. SHE
LOVES KARAOKE got knocked into outer rival at the start, traveled near the back off the rail, rounded the bend three wide, moved out in the lane and
improved position. BIG TREAT broke well then chased along the inside into the turn, exited the bend a bit off the rail, lacked room and steadied behind a
rival in upper stretch, found room along the fence but could not rally. GRANDIOSELY set the pace under pressure from a pair of rivals early on, resisted to
the five-sixteenths pole then relinquished command, chased the winner leaving the turn and gave way. CAL broke out and bumped rival, race in range up
the backstretch, lost ground two wide then along the rail on the bend and could not rally in the drive. SHEMAKESCENTS broke out, dropped back early,
raced between foes leaving the backstretch then went four wide through the turn and failed to menace. WARREN'S QUEEN BEE raced off the pace outside
rivals well off the rail, came five wide into the lane and failed to make an impact. ROYAL BLEND broke a step slow, chased on the inside from off the pace
and had little left in the lane.

DON'T JU FORGET stalked outside a rival to the turn, took aim three then two wide into the stretch, put FURSACE with a furlong remaining and held safely
over the runner-up. SHOCKING GREY broke a step slow, traveled along the inside into the turn at the back, waited for room through the far turn, stayed
inside to the stretch, bumped outer rival in upper stretch, moved out and put in a late run but had to settle for second best. FURSACE sped clear to take
control and moved inside, held a diminished lead leaving the bend, lost command in upper stretch and flattened to third. CANDY ON TOP traveled in
mid-pack early on, raced along the inside then out into the lane, got bumped by SHOCKING GREY in upper stretch and kept on for a minor award.
SAPADILLA raced off the pace in the early going, went two wide into the turn, spun three wide into the lane and weakened. MARGOT'S GIRL popped the
gate open prior to the start, raced outside a rival near the back into the turn, angled out and came four wide into the lane and failed to menace. BEAUTIFUL
TEMPLE chased two wide into the turn then along the inside into the turn, tipped out in the lane and weakened. KAYLAS JOY took a bad step crossing the

Footnotes
GO ON prompted the pace from outside early, headed the leader at the quarter pole, took over soon after, put away BALLADEER in upper stretch, drifted to
the inside and remained clear under left handed urging. SYDNEY STREET (GB) stalked the pace on the inside then two wide around the first turn, took aim
from the three path into the stretch, finished determinedly in the final furlong but could not get to the winner. MIDNIGHT JOSTAR angled to the inside
settling near the back, angled out with a quarter mile remaining and came three wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the show. BALLADEER
hustled to the front and moved inside, set the pace under pressure to the far turn, got headed by GO ON at the quarter pole, gave up the leader shortly after
and weakened down the lane. AGATINO (IRE) was off slow in the beginning, trailed to the far turn, angled to the rail around the bend, kept on through the
lane but was unable to reach contention. KINGMEISTER tracked three to four wide around the first turn, stayed off the rail to the second bend, came two
wide into the drive and lacked the needed response. ROYAL ACT went two then three wide on the first turn and settled in mid-pack, eased out and came
four wide into the stretch and weakened.
