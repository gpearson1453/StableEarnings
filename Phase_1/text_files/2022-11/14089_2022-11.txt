WILDCAT DREAM stalked the pace three wide around the clubhouse turn, surged to the front before a half then widened the balance of the trip under
strong encouragement to win as much the best. IMA SURE BET was bothered repeatedly on the backstretch then again two wide in mid stretch and got up
for second. FIONA was fractious in the gate, drifted repeatedly, improved position three wide before mid stretch then was outfinished for second. HOPS
PETUNIA pressed the early pace two wide, chased the winner into the stretch then stopped in the final furlong. TEST YOUR FAITH set the early pace and
stopped after a half.
