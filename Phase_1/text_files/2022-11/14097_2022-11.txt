Footnotes
MO DIXIE DIVA vied for the early lead, raced three wide around the turn, drove clear down the stretch and finished well. FIRE AND SPEIGHT challenged
on the front end, saved ground around the turn, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. MORO SMOKE
lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn, made a steady gain and proved no match for the top two. GRACE'S VISION void of early speed, showed
late interest, but was no factor. CRAPAUD was an early factor, weakened and finished evenly. CALL ME DARLIN dueled for the early advantage and faded.
MAYWON raced evenly near the back, came around the turn on the outside and was never a threat. DON'T LOOK ETHEL vied for the early lead and
dropped back. GYPSY SOUL always raced near the back and was outrun.

NOSBOR lacked early speed, racing from the rear, moved up around the turn, made a wide rally and got up in time. MOVE IT raced in the middle of the
field, came around the turn on the outside, took the advantage, drove clear and was caught late for the win. FLUFFPOINT vied for the early lead, saved
ground around the turn and lacked a late kick. LOOKIN GOOD SO FAR dueled on the front end and faded. RATHER PRECOCIOUS raced near the back,
came around the turn wide and was never a factor. METALLIC SILVER raced in the middle of the field, weakened and was no threat late. B B MOODY vied
for the early lead, raced three wide around the turn and dropped back. HOT ARTIE void of early speed and was never close.

CHEATIN CHARLIE challenged for the early lead, saved ground around the final turn, dueled down the stretch, was outfinished for the win, but proved best
of others. GRAHAM 'S CRUISER raced within contention, came around the final turn on the outside, made a mild bid, but proved no match for the top two.
IT'S A BIRD void of early speed, trailing the field in the beginning, improved position, but was no factor. MY BOOK raced within striking distance, faded and

Footnotes
GUITAR SLIM raced within contention, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a bid, took command, drove clear and finished well. UNCLE
FRANK pressed the pace, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. HERZEN raced in the back of the pack in the
beginning, came around the second turn on the outside, entered the stretch wide, made a bid and got up for third. WISE VERDICT lacked early speed,
showed late interest, but was no factor. HIGHTAIL COWBOY dueled for the early advantage, saved ground and faded. PALATIAL TIMES void of early
speed and was never close. HOLY EMPEROR challenged on the front end and dropped back. DOCTOR LEO pressed the early pace and retreated.
