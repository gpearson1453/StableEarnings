Footnotes
CIRCLE OF COURAGE vied for the early lead three wide, then was two wide on the turn and made a bid leaving the turn to draw clear, then was kept to
mild pressure to remain clear. CEETA stalked the early pace four wide, then was three wide on the turn, was in range leaving the turn and then was bumped
soundly by the furlong marker, finished willingly to save the place award. MS KAYS COWGIRL tracked the early pace between rivals, then rated back on the
turn, came four wide into the lane, then lugged in through the lane bumping a rival and missed the place award. CRIMSON LILLE was rated along the inside
early, then angled out in the lane and was empty. SOULSTONE vied for the lead on the inside to the quarter pole and gave way. RESPLENDENT IDEA
failed to menace.
