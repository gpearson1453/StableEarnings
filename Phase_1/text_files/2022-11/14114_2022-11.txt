Footnotes
NOBLE PRENDERGAST drifted in, stumbled break, raced well off the early pace, moved up five wide, lugged in through the stretch and edged clear late
under strong pressure. SLINGSHOT BOY dueled for the early lead past the three eighths pole from the outside of rival and gave way grudgingly.
STARDUST ZIGGY showed good early foot set the pace, met bid entering the far turn while racing from the inside of foe and weakened in the final stages.
WORLD FACTOR broke in, bumped at the break, raced from the inside into the far turn, angled just past the five sixteenths pole and made a late gain to
improve position. BULLOUT was off a step slow, raced near the back of the pack early on, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and moved up late
while racing from the outside. MOON SIGN was bumped soundly at the start, well placed to lay just off the top pair from the inside, angled six wide and had
no late rally. SNIP THE ROSES dropped back early, saved ground and never was a factor. RUFFLESNFLOURISHES settled early, lost ground, was three
deep into the upper stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
SICK PACK SARA was off slowly, sent between early, set the pace from the inside and prevailed late under all out pressure. TIZ SUSAN ANN was in
pursuit early from the outside of Sick Pack Sara, drifted a bit near the quarter pole, slowly closed in on the leader from the outside and finished gamely to
the wire. TORCH CARRIER settled off the early pace, moved up around the far turn through the stretch from the inside and made a mild late run. UTTERLY
ENCHANTING chased the pace from the inside past the three eighths pole, circled four wide and raced evenly with no final bid. HAD THE NOTION was
slow early on, raced from the inside and lacked a bid. RAVENEL rated early, advanced through the turn, circled four to five wide and faded.

Footnotes
ICE CUBE BABY was off a step slow, edged up from the inside through the far turn, angled near the eighth pole, split rivals and prevailed in a determined
run late under strong encouragement. LA TACHE raced off the early, angled five to six wide through the upper stretch and finished gamely to the wire while
racing outside of foes. OJITOS BELLOS rushed early on between rivals, raced two to three wide around the far turn and kept on to the wire. EXCLUSIVE
ROSE stalked the pace, raced from the inside near the quarter pole, shifted four wide and raced evenly late. FIVE STAR FRAN was a bit unruly in the gate,
unseated rider briefly, dueled from the inside and gave way grudgingly. ARROGATES DREAM dueled from the outside of rival, led narrowly near the eighth
pole and weakened. SUPER JO JO ducked in at the start, raced from the inside and was outrun.

Footnotes
MUCHACHO MACHO stalked the top pair down the backstretch, moved up three wide around the far turn and finished well to get up under strong handling
while racing from the outside of rival. ROYAL CRUSADER was forwardly placed to lay up close from the inside, raced near the rail in the stretch run and
finished gamely to the wire. AFTERMATH was unhurried early on to race in hand, made an advance through the far turn, angled five to six wide and made a
belated rally. RESIDENT LIBERAL showed good early foot to set the pace while racing two deep outside of rival early on, dropped around the far turn and
weakened a bit in through the drive. EXCALIBUR was allowed to settle early on, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had no
final winning bid. UNIDENTIFIED MAN tracked the pace from the inside and weakened. MAMAIGOTTHIS stumbled slightly at the start, raced at the back of
the pack early and lacked a bid.

handling from the outside of rival. YOUR ANALYSIS pulled early from the inside early on, waited near the quarter pole, moved up between, shifted in to race
from the inside and finished gamely to the wire. UNION LEAGUE tracked the early going, made a three wide near the quarter pole, led narrowly and kept on
willing to the wire. BRILLIANT ICE stumbled at the start, moved up from the inside near the quarter pole, angled to race from the outside of rivals and
moved up. MOON WARRIOR raced off the early pace, made a mid move to gain ground four to five wide through the far turn and flattened out.
NOTIMELIKEPRESENT sent early to set the early pace along the inside and faded. MARCHED pressed the early leader from the outside while racing two
deep, led briefly near the three eighths pole and faded. BIG REDWHITEBLUE dropped back early and failed to respond.

Footnotes
AFJAN stalked the pace while racing four deep outside of rivals, brushed through the upper stretch, was clear near the eighth pole and prevailed late under
strong handling. RAPPER ZAPPER raced off the early pace to race near the back early on, made a steady advance into the far turn, raced three deep near
the quarter pole, angled out to race from the outside of foes, dug in late and just missed in a game effort. AMUSING MISCHIEF was bumped, shuffled back
at the start, rated along from the inside down the backstretch, moved up between in the stretch and finished gamely to the wire. PHRA PHROM stalked the
pace, moved up three wide between rivals nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the inside past the five sixteenths, drifted a bit through the upper
stretch, brushed rival and weakened in the final stages. DOMINGUEZ showed good early foot to set the early pace from the inside and gave way. CHENTI
broke to the outside, bumped rival, tracked the early pace while racing between faded.

WHO KNOWS WHAT pressed the pace, raced three to four deep from the outside of foes and finished well to prove best under strong encouragement.
SKIPPER SUE hopped at the start, dropped back to race near the back of the pack early on, moved up three to four wide around the far turn, angled to race
six deep into the upper stretch and finished gamely to the wire. R B'S STAR dueled for the early lead and weakened a bit through the drive. FLIMSY settled
off the early pace, made a five wide bid and flattened out. OLIVIA DARLING stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch, was blocked nearing the
three sixteenths while continuing an inside bid, altered out and had no late gain. MISTY'S LASS was off a step slow, dropped back early, advanced through
the far turn, fanned seven wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. HOP PICKER broke to the inside, forwardly placed to lay up close from the
outside and faded. MURPH settled off the early going, saved ground and never menaced.

READ THE SPEC drifted out at the start, dropped back early, moved up through the far turn, raced four to five wide from the outside of rivals and drew clear
late under strong handling. DART settled to race off the early pace, moved up from the inside through the stretch run and finished willingly to the wire.
SMART AND FAST was unhurried early on, moved up from the outside in the stretch and made a good late rally. I ONCE STOOD ALONE chased the pace
from the outside, had a narrow lead near the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. HOPE HE'S FAST showed good early foot to set the pace while racing
two wide and weakened. BLAME THE BOURBON showed good early foot, angled out, steadied upper stretch and faded. DREAMS DELIVERED pressed
the pace while racing between and gave way.
