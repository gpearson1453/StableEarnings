Footnotes
KUORA (PER) settled early inside a pair of rivals, waited for room leaving the far turn and into the stretch, angled out into the clear, surged to the front
midstretch and won going away. VAROMA broke a step slow, chased between rivals at the back, came three wide into the lane, steered out in the drive and
rallied for the place. OCTANE (BRZ) stalked three wide early, applied pressure at the half-mile pole but could not keep up at the seven-sixteenths pole,
pursued the leader in the two path through the far turn, re-engaged in upper stretch and took over with a furlong left to run, lost command outside the
sixteenth pole and got edged for the place. A NEW PEACE rated in the two path early then moved inside, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out and
chased between past the eight pole and could not rally. FEATHERS (IRE) chased three deep at the back, entered the lane four wide and weakened. NICE
ICE grabbed the early lead and moved inside, controlled the pace in hand, got pressured at the midway point before moving clear at the seven-sixteenths
pole, was roused on the far turn and showed the way along the inside into the stretch, lost command at the eighth pole and gave way.

Footnotes
FAIZA pressed the pace from outside, headed TEENA ELLA midway around the turn, took over at the quarter pole, put away inner rival at the top of the
stretch, drew off when flagged with the whip and won in hand late. LILY POO chased four wide into and around the turn, kept on willingly down the lane and
bested the rest. MISS MONARCH BAY broke in and bumped rival, chased two wide at the back into the turn, moved out and came four wide into the lane
and summoned a mild response to earn the show honors. POETICA got bumped in the beginning, raced on the inside at the back, exited the bend two wide,
moved out in the drive and improved position. AG BULLET chased the top pair off the inside to the turn, rounded the bend three wide and flattened in the
lane. TEENA ELLA set the pace under pressure from FAIZA to the turn, headed by that rival past the five-sixteenths pole, relinquished the lead at the
quarter pole, could not go on with the winner at the top of the stretch and gave way. PRINCESS MAGIC raced off the pace early on, took the turn four then
five wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SCHOOL DANCE stalked two in the two path early, moved up to apply pressure on the backstretch, chased the leader into the far turn, re-engaged from
outside at the quarter pole, headed rival outside the eighth pole, took over past that marker and moved clear and remained strong to the wire. SIXTEEN
ARCHES (IRE) unhurried in the two path outside a rival, angled out and raced four deep into the lane, summoned a late rally and gained the place.
GLENALL (IRE) shook her head a bit and was keen early when rated on the inside, continued to stalk in hand to the far turn, roused past the quarter pole,
moved out in the lane and got edged for second. BELLE CHERIE stepped to the front quickly and set the pace on the inside, showed the way under
pressure in the middle stages, moved clear into the far turn, pressured again by SCHOOL DANCE at the quarter pole, clung to a narrow lead in upper
stretch, lost command past the eight pole and flattened to fourth. BALLET DANCING was off a bit slow to start, allowed to settle at the back while guided to
the inside, tipped two wide on the far turn, lacked room into the stretch, found a clear path and kept on while failing to threaten. MAEVE OF CONNAUGHT
(IRE) got brushed from inside a the start, settle in the two path near the back, spun three wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. CLADDAGH CURE
steered to the inside racing off the pace, traveled in mid-pack up the backstretch, continued along the fence to the stretch, then moved out a bit and failed to
respond. DENDERA stumbled and broke out to brush rival, pulled and became rank early then settled outside a rival, coaxed two wide into the lane and
weakened.

BIPARTISANSHIP (GB) settled on the inside off the pace, moved closer while under a hold leaving the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, ran
up onto the heels of the leaders at the top of the lane, tipped out to a clear path, rallied alongside the leader with a sixteenth to go and drew clear late.
GOLD FOR KITTEN stalked in the two path early on, moved into range up the backstretch, pushed on two wide into the lane, moved out and rallied to gain
second. ROYAL ADDRESS (IRE) dueled for the lead from inside then ceded command on the first turn, was closest in pursuit in the middle stages,
launched a bid from outside past the three-eighths pole, took over leaving the turn, dueled down the lane and held command into the final sixteenth but was
overtaken by the winner and got edged for the place. SUGAR FIX dueled for command into the first turn then cleared around the bend, controlled the pace
to the far turn, met the bid from outside around the bend, lost command leaving the bend, fought back to the sixteenth pole and faltered late. BURGOO
ALLEY (IRE) traveled in mid-pack two wide early, moved closer three deep, driven three wide into the stretch but lacked a bid in the stretch run. IZZY EM
was allowed to settle and moved into the two path, angled to the rail on the far turn and lacked further response. PULPIT RIDER was off a bit slow in the
beginning then was unhurried on the inside, took closer order up the backstretch but had to steady off heels at the three-eighths pole, tipped two wide at the
quarter pole and failed to menace. WARRENS CANDY GIRL reserved in the two path at the back, spun three wide into the stretch and never made an
impact.

Footnotes
BIG SUMMER raced in range early on, waited for room in the two path then tipped out and bumped GLORIOUS SPRING late on the turn, bumped with that
rival again in upper stretch, drew alongside the leader past the eight pole and kicked clear. GLORIOUS SPRING stalked between foes into the turn, got
bumped by BIG SUMMER late on the bend then again in upper stretch, kept on gamely through the final furlong but could not match the winner late. VELLA
bumped leaving the gate, tracked outside a rival out of range, came out and bumped rival leaving the turn, then rallied for the show. SHE'S BULLETPROOF
dropped back early, swung seven wide into the lane, finished well in the lane but got outkicked for the show. SPANISH CHANNEL was off slow to begin,
chased on the inside into the turn, waited exiting the bend, ran behind traffic in upper stretch, gained a clear path and was put to right handed urging with a
furlong left to run and improved position. TIGER SPICE pressed the pace three deep to the turn, vied for command around the bend and took over with a
quarter mile left to run, shook free in upper stretch but was soon challenged past the eighth pole, relinquished command and gave way in the final sixteenth.
WRONG TURN CUPID bumped with VELLA at the start, went up to take control and set the pace between rivals, vied for the lead around the turn, lost
command at the quarter pole, could not keep up with TIGER SPICE in upper stretch and gave way. DELTA WIND prompted the pace inside the leader,
challenged around the turn, then faded through the lane. VEGAN hopped and came away behind the field, traveled near the back into the turn, raced three
deep then got bumped and forced out leaving the bend causing him to check and could not recover after the incident. TWENTYSEVENTROUTS stalked
four deep to the turn, started to weaken and came five wide into the lane and tired. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING BIG SUMMER AND
GLORIOUS SPRING LATE ON THE TURN AND UPPER STRETCH AND FOLLOWING A REVIEW RULED THAT THE INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A
DISQUALIFICATION. THERE WAS ALSO A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE INCIDENT BETWEEN VELLA AND VEGAN LATE ON THE TURN
AND ALSO RULED THAT THE INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION.

through, took over late and held over the runner-up. PAULLIAC (IRE) dwelt at the start, pulled early while moving to the inside, remained out of range into
the far turn, continued to save ground then angled out in the stretch, flew late outside the top trio and missed. FLEET FEET bumped at the start, set the
pace on the inside, met the bid from outside on the far turn, carried a short lead into the stretch, resisted into the final sixteenth and yielded grudgingly late.
LOW EXPECTATIONS bumped with FLEET FEET at the start, raced up close in the early, challenged from outside on the far turn, fought through the lane
and three deep in deep stretch but lacked the needed late kick in the closing moments. STONKS traveled two wide in mid-pack early, spun three wide into
the lane, moved out in the drive and needed to find more late. KEEN TO GO reserved in the early going and tucked inside, exited the far turn in the two
path, moved back to the rail in the drive and lacked a rally. SECRET TREASURE chased outside a rival then between foes, coaxed two wide into the lane,
found traffic behind rivals near the eighth pole and could not rally after moving to a clear path. DARYL'S BOLT raced two wide outside a rival off the pace,
traveled between rivals on the far turn, came three wide into the drive, moved out in the lane and failed to rally. DE LA LUNA stalked the pace three deep,
coaxed three wide exiting the far turn and weakened. AS ONE DOES got bothered from outside at the start, traveled near the back in the early going, got
blocked behind rivals at the three-eighths pole, swung out and came five wide into the stretch and failed to menace. AZURE STAR (IRE) was tossing his
head around prior to the start then whipped his head and hopped at the start, pulled early while steering to the inside at the back, moved out on the
backstretch, raced three deep then got floated out into the stretch and was never a factor. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE START
OF AZURE START (IRE) AND AFTER A REVIEW RULED THAT HE WAS NOT AWARDED A FAIR START AND IS DECLARED A NON-STARTER.
