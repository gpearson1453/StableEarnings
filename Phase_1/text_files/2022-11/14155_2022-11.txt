Footnotes
SENSIBLE JIM hustled to a clear advantage, controlled the fractions, repelled a challenge near midstretch and edged clear again. VERBIER advanced
closer inside, bid outside in the stretch, loomed a threat but was outfinished. STAFF SERGEANT chased three wide then began fading on the final turn.
STELLA'S TOUR saved ground off the leaders and lacked a response. MAJOR CAM raced within range in the two path early then gave way readily.
PRINCIPE dropped back after the start and trailed throughout.

RUFFY chased four wide down the backstretch, surged to the front midway on the turn then drew off and remained safe under moderate pressure.
HOTPOT broke alertly then trailed early then advanced well extremely wide to be easily second best. COLD WALKER moved to a clear advantage inside,
vied on the turn and weakened. CHROME DIXIE prompted the pace three wide, faded on the turn then mildly came again. SOUTHERN RUNNER lacked
speed along the inside and was never in contention. JOVIAL broke slowly, rushed up inside, dueled in the two path on the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
QUEEN LUCKY raced off the pace between rivals, advanced between horses at the quarter pole, rallied steadily outside in the final furlong and wore down
the leaders to prevail. NICKYS NOTION vied inside for the lead, dueled on the turnm dug in gamely on the rail in the stretch drive and battled to the end.
RANDOM LUCK vied outside for the lead, dueled on the turn, dug in gamely between rivals in the stretch run and was outkicked. ONE PAIR OF HANDS
lunged and broke in the air, off poorly, caught up to the field on the backside, moved up on the turn and rallied mildly between foes. FANCY SCEPTER
tracked on the inside, chased on the turn and lacked a bid. ALWAJD was outrun early on the inside, then passed tired rivals. BUNNY BONUS stalked three
wide, chased on the turn, went four wide at the quarter pole and tired. TWYLA stalked between rivals, chased and faded. LADY RYAN raced off the pace
inside and did not factor. CUP OF LIFE raced three wide off the pace, went five wide past the quarter pole and gave way.

Footnotes
SHOWING OFF stalked the pace outside, bid to the front at the top pf the stretch then edged away while kept to a drive. SOVEREIGN CHANGE settled
outside off the leaders, moved inside in the lane, angled back out and closed gap late. TEMPESTUOUS controlled the pace, was collared on the final turn,
lost the advantage but continued willingly. MUSK raced close up inside, faded on the final turn then rallied wide while no threat. JACK GAVE BACK raced
far behind then passed rivals without menacing. LAWLESSNESS moved close up inside then was finished after half a mile. MY BROTHER NEIL lacked
speed outside, was asked for run into the far turn then stopped.

that rival in deep stretch to prevail. FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL set the pace on the inside, responded when roused turning for home, dug in gamely inside and
yielded grudgingly late. FAST BREAKIN CASH tracked on the inside, chased inside on the turn, angled out and rallied mildly. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE stalked
between rivals, chased two wide on the turn and finished evenly. GOLDEN SPOKE raced off the rail, off the pace, chased three wide on the turn and had no
rally. RACK GIN raced off the pace inside and did not factor. MANAHAWKIN was outrun.

led into the far turn, battled inside the winner and yielded late. WILL TAKE CONTROL raced within range early and continued well while no threat. RUDY
ROD chased off the leaders three wide and flattened out in the stretch. DON'T RECALL moved very wide throughout and lacked a solid rally. DANGNABBIT
dueled along the rail for half a mile and weakened. WARRANT OFFICER trailed early and was never in contention. VERO SUN lacked speed and was
always outrun. DOUGIE saved ground and gave way readily.

Footnotes
CARTWHEEL broke awkwardly, advanced wide into the stretch, finished strongly and was up in the late yards. EXCITABLE LADY rallied between rivals on
the turn, led briefly in midstretch but was then caught. CAUSE I SAID moved closer three wide on the turn and finished well too late. SEAMIALAUGH saved
ground then narrowed the gap in the final furlong. VITAEMI dueled for the lead, moved clear midway on the turn but weakened. LIVE AID forced the pace
outside, edged ahead in midstretch then tired. SPANIKOPITA far behind early, moved inside on the turn, angled out and was taken up between rivals near
midstretch. VICS COOL CAT lacked speed racing wide and was never a factor. TWIRLING WIND chased very wide, faded on the turn then passed faders.
CABRA CHICA raced just off the leaders inside and proved empty in the stretch. SYSTEMIC RISK forced the pace three wide and gave way in the stretch.
FAST INTENTIONS flashed speed in the three path and retreated. A claim of foul by the rider of SPANIKOPITA against the winner for interference in the
stretch was dismissed.
