Footnotes
JULIA'S CHARDONNAY was away alertly to clear at once, slowly widened through the turn and into the lane then was ridden out while continuing to extend
the advantage to the wire. LILY'S HOME chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four and gained the place spot
while not a threat to the winner. MANAGED MISCHIEF chased the winner through the turn from the three path, had aim on the top one after straightening in
the lane then lost the place spot late while weakening. BELLE ELENA saved ground through the turn and into the lane and lacked a closing bid. TAYA
ALLDAYA was in the three path through the turn while trailing, came into the lane from the five path and never was a factor. A STAR FOR CORA near the
rail through the turn and into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
GO EMI was unhurried while off the inside, moved through the four path on the turn, swung into the lane from the five path and rallied through the final
eighth to be up in time. UNIFIED DREAMS was three wide through the turn when moving to loom as a serious contender, bid into the lane from the three
path, gained a short lead outside the eighth pole, cleared inside the sixteenth pole, looked a winner from there then could not hold the fast closing winner
safe to the wire. FRENCH COMPOSER set the pace while under pressure through the turn, continued with a short lead into the lane, yielded to the winner
inside the eighth pole then just stayed on for the show spot. BOX OFFICE WARRIOR was in the three or four path through the far turn, bid three wide into
the lane and lacked the needed finish while missing the show spot. KENTUCKY MIST raced evenly into the lane while in the two path and lacked a finishing
bid. SCORE KEEPER pressed the pace two wide through the far turn and gave way entering the lane. TITLE SHOT steadily faded while saving ground.

Footnotes
MUSIC TO MY EARS chased the pace from the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path, engaged the leader just outside the eighth
pole then dueled through the final eighth and just got up. UNCLE EARL set the pace through the turn while in the three path, dueled with the winner through
the final eighth and grudgingly gave in. JUNIOR BUG was in the two path through the turn and into the lane then offered a mild gain for the show spot.
KITTENS ADAIR saved ground through the turn and into the lane and finished evenly. CIELO AZUL was in the three path through the turn, came into the
lane from the six path, still remained a contender inside the eighth pole then just needed more late response. EL PIQUIN never a factor while saving ground.
ARTIE'S LADY made little impact from the two path.

Footnotes
HERMANA chased the pace from the three path through the far turn, bid into the lane from the three path, cleared outside the eighth pole then held while
being kept busy. BABY BLUE EYES settled off the early pace while off the rail, moved closer through the turn from the three path, was asked for more into
the lane then slowly gained through the final furlong and settled for second best while offering a mild gain. LOVELY LISA set the pace on a clear lead from
near the inside, continued clear after mid-turn, gave little resistance when headed by the winner then stayed on to be clear for the show spot. LEMON
ROSES saved ground through the turn and into the lane then lacked a finishing bid. DALTON'S LOVE was in the four to the three path through the turns
and never was a serious menace. IRISH TAP was in the three or four path through the turns when never far back then tired after entering the lane.
GABERDINE was in the two path into the far turn while not far back then was suddenly done in mid-turn.

Footnotes
NEVER TO MANY HUGS chased the two rival duel through the turn while in the three path, bid into the lane from the four path, swept past the leaders while
dropping into the three path then drew away while under a hand drive. DARNELL was in the two path through the turn and into the lane when moving up,
bid inside the eighth pole, had aim on the leader but was no match for that one while finishing clear for the place spot. GOLDEN HEIST raced in the three or
four path through the turn when never far back, swung into the five path into the lane, was a threat after straightening then improved for the show spot from
mid-track. MRSINATRAGLORYLADY saved ground through the turn cut the corner and benefited when others swung wide, got closest to the winner near
the eighth pole then could not sustain the effort. LIZZSAIDNO bothered at the start, settled to the back, raced in the three path through the turn, came into
the lane from the six path and never was a threat. SANTIVA DIVA in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and
never was a factor. SNUGGLER vied for the lead two wide through the turn then was empty turning into the lane. WOO WOO GIRL vied inside through the
turn then was swallowed up entering the lane.
