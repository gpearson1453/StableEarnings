Footnotes
STUBBORN STREAK rated kindly behind the contesting leaders into the turn, waited on the rail with five sixteenths remaining looking for a seam, found
clear run in the three path at the top of the lane and wore down the leader through the stretch to get up nearing the finish line for the victory. PIDIN showed
good speed to set the pace down the backside, was pressed outside around the turn, repelled a brief challenge from the outside in upper stretch but could
not find more to hold off the closing winner nearing the wire. I'M NO SLEEPY JOE broke outwards at the start, tracked the engaging leaders on the turn,
was ridden at the quarter pole outside to go after the frontrunners, contended four wide at the top of the stretch and raced evenly the final eighth holding for
the show money. UGOTAFRIENDINME travelled near the rear on the rail in the beginning, was urged inside three furlongs out to start a rally, shifted outside
at the furlong marker and showed late energy to rally getting up for a minor role. IT'S TRUE pressed the pace just outside around the turn, bid for the top
spot in upper stretch, gave way between rivals inside at the furlong marker and tired the last sixteenth while on the wrong lead running to the finish. ONE
MORE RING was allowed to settle trailing the field at the half mile marker, put in a brief rally three wide two furlongs to the line, shifted out widest in the six
path turning for home and could not get interested running to the wire. SEATTLE APPEAL settled three wide outside foes in mid pack in the early stages,
was asked for more run midway on the turn, had little to offer at the quarter pole and made no impact running inside through the stretch.

Footnotes
THUNDERHEAVYRAIN settled off the pace racing off the inside after breaking out just a bit, fanned seven wide into upper stretch, struck the lead nearing
the sixteenth and drove past under just hand urging at that point. MERITAMEN settled about mid-pack, advanced near but off the rail late on the turn,
moved out four wide at the top of the stretch making close contact with a rival, drifted out a further path in upper stretch, took the lead at the eighth pole, was
outkicked but second best. MACHINA was urged at the break but lacking speed, raced off the inside, shifted eight wide in upper stretch, kicked on belatedly.
FERDA broke outwardly and a step slowly, raced near the inside, improved position in the stretch. ASHLEE'S RING shifted inside a rival heading up the
backstretch, moved closer inside that foe but off the rail on the turn going three to four wide, was within range turning for home but evened out.
BLUEBERRY DOLL broke a half step slowly, raced near the rail, was unable to menace. GETTING AHEAD set the pace racing off the rail, drifted out a bit
turning for home, weakened in the stretch. CHROME'S ANGEL was encouraged forward to pursue the pace, raced outside four then five wide on the turn,
weakened in the stretch. D'ORO BABY was urged at the break, chased from inside, switched out leaving the backstretch to pursue in the three path on the
turn, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
CANADIANSWEETHEART was part of the foursome chasing the leader three wide into the turn, took control at the quarter pole outside, opened up on the
field comfortably with a sixteenth to run and kept on in deep stretch for the victory. MORE GELATO was unhurried in the early stages to trail, could see them
all angling out six wide for the stretch drive and closed belatedly to get up for place nearing the wire. SILVER SIGN settled on the rail behind the pacesetter
throughout the turn, shifted just off the fence turning for home to offer a mild run, chased the winner in vain in mid stretch and faded late losing the place
award nearing the finish line. FAST'N SEXY was part of the second flight watching the early frontrunner three furlongs from the wire, was ridden for more
between foes at the quarter marker, could not quicken with fellow rivals and was one paced through the stretch. PASSION TO PLEASE was situated near
the rear with a half mile to run, waited behind challengers two furlongs from the finish, found a seam to have clear run in the four path in upper stretch and
passed tired runners through the lane. QUIET MADDELENA lead the field running down the backside and turn, was collared by the winner at the top of the
lane and retreated on the fence in the final sixteenth. DELILAH'S REVENGE was part of the pack tracking the early leader while widest in the four path with
three furlongs to go, was coaxed for more run outside at the quarter marker, could not keep pace with rivals and weakened between in mid stretch.

Footnotes
ONEZY'S DREAM was in tight early in behind runners, moved out, advanced rapidly five then six wide on the turn, took aim in upper stretch, gained steadily
and slowly and edged past inside the final sixteenth. SILENT GUROO broke alertly and was keen to go on despite rider's restraint, eventually settled in
while dictating terms racing off the inside, went in the three path through the turn faced with moderate outside pressure, was challenged in mid- to
late-stretch by inside and outside foes but fought on to preserve the place. ORBALINE was coaxed forward inside in behind the leader, saved ground near
the rail through the turn, edged closer nearing the sixteenth pole but needed more. VALLEY GIRL raced inside off the leaders into the turn, came out three
wide by the quarter pole, ran on in the stretch. FEDALIA stalked off the leader, edged closer four wide on the turn to draw alongside the rear flank of the
leader, flattened out in the drive. CRUMLIN TIME was just off the leaders, ridden along past the three-eighths going three to four wide on the turn, moved
out further in upper stretch, had no late bid. SARARENDA moved up while wide, ridden along at the three-eighths going four to five wide on the turn, shifted
in at the top of the stretch, was never a threat. RED EQUINOX was ridden along from between runners at the half, tired.

Footnotes
HANDCARVED took the lead angling off the rail leaving the chute, comfortably dictated the pace running on the turn and had something left when
challenged in mid stretch to hold safe at the wire. GOZILLA tracked between rivals mid pack three furlongs from the wire, took closer order to bid four wide
turning for home and could not find another gear to threaten for the win in the last eighth. KID FORESTER was taken back soon after the start to trail down
the backstretch, rallied four wide angling out at the quarter pole and finished with intent between runners to close in and capture third money nearing the
finish. SAIL AT SUNRISE pressed the pace outside in the beginning, chased the winner throughout the turn, vied between runners in the three path in upper
stretch and levelled out with foes on either side at the furlong marker. PRINCE OF THIEVES was in a good spot well in hand behind the front running winner
down the backside, saved all the ground racing on the turn, was in contention on the fence until mid stretch and stalled the final sixteenth of a mile.
SOUPER RIVER tracked outside horses three wide in midfield at the half, tried to advance around foes three wide through the turn but to no avail and faded
in the six path running through the stretch.

Footnotes
BROKEN PROPOSAL raced off the leader two to three wide and between runners through the opening three-eighths, continued to track in behind near but
just off the rail, moved nearer the inside to save ground on the far turn advancing on the leader, came up in behind in upper stretch then tipped out three
wide at the furlong marker, struck the lead outside the sixteenth pole and drove clear. SILENT SCARLET moved clear and shifted in to set the pace racing
just off the rail in the two path, was clear into upper stretch, no match for the winner but second best. FORESTERS PRINCESS moved forward heading to
the first turn and shifted in from four to three wide on that bend in pursuit of the leader, continued in range three wide on the far turn, paused momentarily
near the eighth pole when the winner came out in front but clear, kept on well enough to preserve show honors. PHIL IN ECHO broke just a half-step slowly,
shifted in bringing up the rear, saved ground through the first turn, moved out and advanced three wide and between runners at the three-eighths moving
out four wide by the quarter pole, was within range in upper stretch, needed more. JOLENE JOLENE raced outside three to four wide mid-pack just off the
leaders, steadily weakened. PRINCESS LAVENDER pursued from inside, dropped back.

Footnotes
GAMBLE'S SILVER settled in mid pack outside foes down the backstretch, began to pick up rivals three wide midway through the turn, angled five wide for
the drive to lead at the eighth pole and was kept to the task edging away nearing the wire. SWINGING MANDY broke a bit slow inside at the start, was
eager behind runners on the rail five furlongs left to run, finally settled to nicely rate on the fence waiting to pounce behind rivals throughout the turn, found a
seam in the two path in deep stretch and shot through to capture place at the finish line. TAQUANYAH travelled near the rear on the rail at the half, shifted
off the fence five sixteenths from the wire to rally six wide for the drive and closed strongly to just miss out on the place award in the end. SWIRLING
DANCER set the pace on the rail in the early stages, was pressured outside on the turn, turning for home was headed by multiple outside rivals, fought
stubbornly on the fence through the lane and stalled the last sixteenth. MISS BRENTWOOD tracked the engaging frontrunners three furlongs from the prize,
offered a bid four wide in upper stretch to be in the hunt and could not keep up with the leaders in the final eighth. YA MAR pressed the lead just outside in
the beginning, challenged for the front racing on the turn, was collared between horses at the top of the lane, battled on for an eighth and gave way in deep
stretch. STERLING SPEED was content to trail down the backside, could see the field running through the turn, angled six wide at the top of the lane and
could not be a presence running to the wire.

Footnotes
COOL SOCIETY was in just a hair tight at the break, settled off the pace near but just off the inside, waited till the far turn to commence a move, advanced
while fanning six wide into upper stretch, struck the lead outside rivals by the furlong marker and edged clear. MIA'S AUTHORITY settled just off the leaders
tracking inside, came out two to three wide, rallied inside foes to secure the place over SAN NICOLA STAR, who raced toward the back three to four wide
through the first turn, advanced into the far turn going four then five wide on that bend, made a mild bid in upper stretch but needed more and lost place late.
IVY'S STAR angled in early and unhurriedly brought up the rear, came out in upper stretch, kicked on well but too late. WICKED MIAH was lightly bumped
into a rival at the start, stalked from outside four to five wide, moved to challenge at the quarter pole taking a brief lead at the top of the stretch but lacked
the needed late kick. AWILDAS TREASURE steadied on heels just slightly heading into the first turn, went two to three wide on both bends, failed to rally.
BOSSALINA stalked early from outside two to three wide, moved to challenge and take the lead just past the three-eighths, was overtaken turning for home
and weakened. REIGN BY REIN set the pace inside, was pressured into the far turn then weakened. BLU SKY SUNRISE was bumped lightly at the start,
caught four wide between runners into the first turn, maintained forward position up the backstretch, had no rally and dropped back and faded. GLOVANNA
bumped the inside rival lightly at the start, was floated six wide into the first turn moving in just a hair while dropping back, was never near enough to
threaten.
