the lane and flattened stride. JACKSON MAN saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn
and passed rivals in the lane. MIO GRACELAND saved ground off the pace, bid toward the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and
weakened in the lane. WINDSOR'S TRACKER rounded the first turn about the four path and showed little response. SPINISH settled in the three path the

Footnotes
KATALIMA saved early ground then eased outward into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the
three path and dug in through the lane to get up later yards. KARPATHIAN DREAM veered outward and made contact with Moiraine leaving the gate and
raced in the four path the first turn, took the lead into the backstretch and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the
far turn at the rail and dug in under steady handling, but relented later yards. SARAH'S WARRIOR saved early ground, picked up the chase nearing the five
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened later yards. CASTLE OF CAYLEE stalked inside on the first turn but was taken back leaving
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and passed rivals in the lane. LADY LICIOUS settled back in the two and three paths the
first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole then flattened at the rail on the far turn. GLOBAL EMPRESS rounded the first turn in the three
path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but flattened past the five sixteenths and raced in the four path of the far turn. MOIRAINE was bumped
at the break then took over approaching the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to set the pace, was met into the backstretch, gave chase from that
point but weakened at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
EVANESCO contested the pace between horses most of the backstretch, took the nod toward the quarter pole and dug in under steady handling to hold on.
HARLEY SIOUX was squeezed at the break then picked up the chase inside, rounded the turn near the rail, angled to the six path toward the head of the
lane, angled in from the heels of Neednoexplantaion mid-stretch, dug in to take second the final yards and was gaining on the winner. DONNIE B broke in
and made contact with Harley Sioux then gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn then dueled through late yards to take the nod for third. IN THE
LIMELIGHT contested the pace inside, raced near the rail on the turn and dueled through the stretch but missed the nod for third. NEEDNOEXPLANATION
contested the early pace, raced three wide on the turn, drifted leaving the turn then flattened in the lane. RAISE A RUCKUS engaged in close early chase,
rounded the turn about the four path, drifted into the lane and showed little more. NICE BUT NAUGHTY chased outside, was forced outward into the turn
and had little left in the lane. RIVER ROYALE R V F gave chase, rounded the turn about the five path and weakened. MY PHOENIX dwelt at the break.

Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS JESSE set a pressured pace through the backstretch, was met at the rail toward the head of the lane but dug in determinedly to hold off the
game stretch challenge of BIG HAMBONE, who chased through the backstretch and raced close in the four path of the turn, drew to even terms toward the
head of the lane, drifted leaving the turn but dueled gamely to the wire. PISTOL P engaged in close chase, raced off the rail on the turn, angled to the six
path toward the head of the lane then dug in to take the nod for third the final stride. GRAND FIBER contested the pace to the five sixteenths pole, rounded
the turn in the three path, raced evenly through the lane and was nipped from third under the wire. SCOTTY SILVER broke a step slow then picked up the
chase inside, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. PERSONAL MEADOW pressured the early pace inside, but dropped back
approaching the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn at the rail and weakened. GAMING JACK chased, rounded the turn in the three and four path and
showed little in the lane. ZANNO gave chase and rounded the turn about the six path.

Footnotes
SHOSHONI MOON settled just off the pace about the three path, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole and improved in the three path on the far turn, then dug
in determinedly to eke out the nod in the final strides. MY FLICKER stalked the early pace from the three path, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole and took
a slim lead two deep toward the head of the lane, dug in gamely through the final furlong but missed the nod in the final strides. ESCAPE FUND stalked off
the rail, took a slim lead at the seven sixteenths pole and was pressured from the five sixteenths, gave up the advantage at the rail toward the head of the
lane and weakened leaving the far turn. MY LOVELY GIRL rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, steadied at the rail
approaching the five sixteenths and showed little more. JAMESTOWN ROAD saved ground, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn in the four path and showed little in the lane. TIMEISGOLDEN rounded the first turn in the four path, picked up the chase nearing the
three eighths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn then weakened. CANVAS ART set the early pace inside, came under pressure leaving the half mile
pole, was met at the seven sixteenths and gave chase from that point but faded at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
LIGHTNING LAD rounded the first turn in the six path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved in the three path of the far turn, took the
lead while being carried out into the lane, but dug in under determined handling and inched clear the final yards. ARE YOU HAPPY stalked the early pace
three wide, took the nod into the backstretch and dueled clear toward the quarter pole, drifted while ceding the nod leaving the turn but dueled gamely to
late stretch before reluctantly yielding. GORUN rounded the opening turn about the five path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and raced
close in the three path of the far turn, angled in leaving the turn but flattened the final sixteenth. TURTLENECK TED saved early ground, picked up the
chase from the three eighths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, angled to the six path leaving the turn and ran evenly in the lane. DR WILL
showed the way with a slim early lead inside, was met into the backstretch and gave chase from that point, raced at the rail on the far turn then weakened.
BOUBOLINO settled in the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and showed little in the
lane. COLONIAL ROAD left the first turn outside and showed little response. PLAYING GOLD settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened in the five path of the far turn. FORTY DREAMS stalked the pace two deep on the first turn, dueled
between horses leaving the half mile pole then weakened into the far turn. MORNING ARTIE saved ground.
