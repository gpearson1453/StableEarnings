Footnotes
GETTINHOT'NHERE went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and won under steady urging. LUCKY BREAK pressed the pace, forwardly placed
throughout, made a bid, racing four wide and finished willingly. SPORTY FLYER unhurried in the beginning, made a late gain, proved no match for the top
two, but got up for show. J C'S IN TOWN raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the turn, made a mild bid and was caught for third.
WEDINGTON pressed the pace, came around the turn three wide and faded. THIRTYEIGHTCALIBER void of early speed and was never a threat.
AUTOCRATIC always raced near the back and showed little. BALKY raced within contention in the early part and made a steady retreat.

Footnotes
GOTTATAKEHIMTO void of early speed, rallied, racing five wide around the turn, took the lead and pulled away, proving much the best. CHAPEL OF
DREAMS lacked early speed, made a steady gain, rallied late on the rail and proved no match for the winner. DOUBLE PRIORITY unhurried, racing near
the back, made a late bid, four wide and got up for third. SASSI ASPEN raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout, finished evenly, lacking a late
kick and was caught for third. GRAND PRODUCTION pressed the pace, raced outside around the second turn and faded. SHOT ON WINDY HILL raced
near the middle of the field, weakened and was never a threat. ST BASIL raced within contention, dropped back, finished wide and was outrun. JUST PLAIN
MAD sprinted to the front, drove clear, saved ground and stopped.

TAPPED OUT vied for the early advantage, saved ground, drove clear down the home stretch and held on well for the win. NUGGET OF GRACE
challenged on the front end, forwardly placed throughout, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. COUNTRY CUT raced within striking
distance, came around the final turn on the outside and proved no match for the top two. UNBRIDLED PULPIT lacked early speed, came around the second
turn wide, made a mild bid, but was no factor. VALIANT DEFENDER raced in the back of the pack and passed tired ones. MARVINS GOLD pressed the
early pace and faded. MICHAEL'S BAD BOY raced in the middle of the field in the beginning, dropped back and was outrun.

FASTED pressed the pace, raced three wide around the final turn, took the lead, drove clear and was kept to the task. MEAN AMERICAN unhurried in the
early going, racing in the middle of the pack, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. SECRET MELODY void of early
speed, came around the final turn wide, finished willingly and got up for show. MARIAH'S CANDY raced within striking distance, put forth an even effort and
lacked a late kick. FLAT ROSE raced in the middle of the pack, came around the first turn on the outside and put forth an even effort. BOSTON BELLE vied
for the early lead, saved ground and faded. JUST A WIN pressed the pace and was finished early. I LOVE YOU MORE void of early speed and was never
close. UGOTTAGO raced near the back and was never a threat. ABSOLUTELY MINDY always raced near the back and showed little.

DRIED PEPPER raced in the middle of the pack, made a late bid and drove clear. CREEKMORE dueled for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout,
took the lead, but couldn't match strides with the winner late. STEPHEN'S ANSWER raced near the middle of the pack, moved up on the outside around the
second turn, showed late interest, proved no match for the top two, but got up for third. GENTRIFIED lacked early speed, made a late gain and finished
willingly. FRANK THE MAYOR void of early speed, came around the final turn wide, moved up but was no factor. POWERSHOT raced in the back of the
pack and passed tired ones. MASTERLY raced near the back and was never a threat. BET AGAIN raced within contention and faded. HIS GIANT dueled on
the front end and dropped back. DECEMBER SEVEN pressed the early pace, was finished early and trailed late.
