Footnotes
DIXIELAND CANDY tracked the early leader while racing just off the inside, raced four deep near the three sixteenths pole, dug in late to finish with good
energy and edged clear under strong handling while racing three to four deep. FLYTA rated to race in hand while racing outside of foes, raced five wide into
the upper stretch and finished gamely late to narrowly get up for the place position. VEILAZIG raced off the early pace, made a strong bid while racing near
the rail through the upper stretch to challenge for the lead and was outkicked in the drive. STRONG WOMAN settled off the early pace while racing well off
the inside, raced five wide around far turn and lacked a rally while continuing an outside bid. FACESTER raced off the early going from the outside,
continued an outside bid in the drive and failed to respond. FADED MEMORIES showed good early speed to set the early pace and tired readily.

Footnotes
YANKEE INDIAN dueled for the early lead from the inside and kicked clear in the drive to widen on the field under steady pressure. CHARING CROSS
settled near the back of the pack early, moved up near the rail in the stretch run and finished well to get up for the place position. FRIGERATOR dueled
from the outside of Yankee Indian and weakened the final eighth of a mile. SELLING SHORT stalked the dueling pair down the backstretch while racing
three deep, angled five wide and raced evenly with no late rally. LAVA BOMB chased the early pace, shifted out to race five deep near the quarter pole and
never threatened. AVENGING WARRIOR was unhurried early and failed to respond. KWONTRO was bumped at the start, raced between rivals early, run
up heels, checked sharply and tired in the latter stages.

Footnotes
TACHA GOLD was off a step slow, circled the field while racing five wide and edged clear late under strong pressure. CANDY TAP showed good early foot
to set the pace, was overtaken near the quarter pole and held the place position late. MAZI chased the early pace, raced from the inside in the stretch run
and had no final winning bid. LALIA prompt the pace from the outside and weakened. COMPETITIVE SPIRIT stalked the pace while racing three deep and
weakened in the drive. SWEET DYNASTY settled off the early going, raced five wide around the far turn and had no response. MY SECRETARIAT raced
far back and was eased up on in the stretch.

MISS CANEY held a slim lead in opening stages, vied around the turn, held a slight advantage a furlong out, dug in gamely under strong handling and held
on. THE VEGAS BOMB was forwardly placed in opening stages then advanced three wide mid-way around the turn, vied for the lead into upper stretch,
continued in striking distance and failed to get by the winner late. STELLA G angled inside soon after the start, tracked the early pace, cut the corner
entering the lane, tipped two wide mid-stretch and dug in to prevail for show. WHEN JUDY CALLS launched a five wide bid near the quarter pole, ran on
four to five wide in the lane and got outnodded for show. ALTERNATE ABBY raced off the top two flights entering the turn, hustled up into the lane and
lacked a rally. GOSPEL CHOSEN pressed the early pace, vied around the turn then tired in the drive. CATALE WINEMIXER hit the rail soon after the start,
quickly dropped back and failed to move into contention. JJCHALKTHEDIAMOND lacked speed and never menaced. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN

Footnotes
MISSISZIPPY BLING tracked the early pace on the inside, launched a rail bid in the upper stretch, engaged SUMMER LIGHTNING for the lead, dug in
along the inside and edged away. SUMMER LIGHTNING held a slight advantage in opening stages then held clear around the turn, took on the challenge
from the eventual winner in upper stretch, vied along the outside and failed to match late. RELIANT was ridden along three wide into the turn, swung four
wide into the lane, sustained response and gained show. MIA BABY advanced into close contention approaching the quarter pole then flattened in the lane.
ITSONLYMONEYHONEY lacked early speed and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn, tipped three wide for the drive and lacked a needed
rally. STILL OF THE NIGHT showed response two to three wide in early stages then gave way. CHEROKEE COWGIRL raced midpack, saved ground
around the turn and faded in the lane. HEATIN UP raced off the early pace, chased three wide around the turn and never threatened. KARALINKA failed to
move into contention.

Footnotes
CUPIDS LOVE tracked the early pace on the inside, launched a two wide bid for HEELS TO THE FIELD in upper stretch, dug in determinedly under strong
handling and edged away. HEELS TO THE FIELD set the early pace and continued clear around the turn, hustled up along the inside heading into the lane
and got denied in deep stretch. SILVER LEGACY raced off the early pace, swung six wide into the lane and produced a solid finish. BLING MOON ranged
up five wide near the quarter pole, sustained response in the upper stretch then flattened in the final furlong. SHAWK'S LIL AVA raced off the early pace,
saved ground around the turn and improved position without threatening. EUROROSE raced on the inside near midpack around the turn then weakened in
the lane. OTEKA BE FAST raced in contention two to three wide then tired in the drive. GET OUT TONIGHT raced in contention four wide around the turn
and failed to keep pace in the lane. PIPPA'S PROSPECT lacked early speed, hustled along three wide into the lane and never threatened. POLLY SPENT
IT raced just off midpack around the turn then retreated. RAINING failed to move into contention. FLY FENIX FLY showed brief speed then retreated, eased
up in the lane and walked off.

BE DANCIN for the lead three furlongs from home, vied two wide around the turn, could not match strides at the head of the lane and gave way in the final
furlong. GOSPEL SISTER raced near midpack, swung four wide into the lane and had a mild improve in deep stretch. RAINBOW SMILES raced two to
three wide in early contention then flattened in the lane. RUBY THE DESTROYER raced off the early pace, was ridden along three wide into the stretch and
lacked a rally. DON'T TELL OKIE raced two wide off the pace and never threatened. ALLINFORTUNE urged inside around the turn and failed to respond.

saved ground and widened advantage entering the lane and held sway under a driving finish. SHADOWLESS stalked the leader through early stages,
coaxed three wide at the quarter pole, sustained a three wide bid through the lane and captured place. KOKOKOMO settled off the early pace, saved
ground around the far turn, given cue along the inside entering the lane, responded and just missed place. SILENCE D'ORO set the pace down the
backstretch, vied for the lead entering the far turn, could not match strides with the eventual winner approaching the quarter pole and gave way. COLOSI
lacked speed and raced in the back, saved ground around the far turn and lacked a rally. CHROME BABY raced four wide heading into the first turn, rated
near midpack pace through the backstretch and had no response when called upon. DOC IRWIN raced outside off the early pace and steadily retreated in
late stages.
