Footnotes
LEISUREWEAR (IRE) sped to the front from inside, coaxed along into and around the far turn, urged left and right handed in the lane and remained clear.
SAREEHA (IRE) was closest in pursuit outside the leader in the two path, took aim two wide into the stretch, chased the winner through the lane but was
unable to find the needed late kick while clearly second best. RUTHLESS BUT KIND stalked three deep early on, asked around the far turn, could not go on
with the top pair but churned on to hold the show. FIRST POINT broke out but was quickly corrected, steered down to the rail and settled early, moved out
and raced outside the loose horse to the half-mile pole, cleared the ridereless foe and moved back to the rail racing inside a pair of rivals into the far turn,
had to steady when in tight briefly at the three-eighths pole, stayed along the inside to the stretch and passed tired rivals for a minor award.
LOOKINTOGETEVEN broke out and was straightened quickly, tracked in the two path then between rivals on the backstretch, raced inside a rival a bit off
the rail around the far turn and could not rally. TAKEMEBYTHEHAND (GB) was off a bit slow to begin, traveled three wide early and was unhurried at the
back, went three deep into the far turn, stayed outside a rival into the stretch and lacked further response. INFINITE EMPIRE hopped, stumbled badly and
unseated the rider at the start, jumped shadows and hit the inner rail first time through the stretch, was eventually corralled and walked off. THERE WAS A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INOLVING THE START OF INFINITE EMPIRE AND AFTER A REVIEW RULED THAT SHE CAUSED HER OWN PROBLEMS AT
THE START AND IS CONSIDERED A STARTER.

Footnotes
PICKING IT UP set the pace with APFEL pressuring from outside, maintained a short lead two wide through the turn, shook free in upper stretch and drew
away. APFEL prompted the pace from outside up the backstretch, kept the pressure on three wide through the turn, could not keep up with the winner in
upper stretch and stayed on for a clear second. LA'OCH ALOYSIUS bobbled leaving the gate, stalked between rivals early on, went two then three wide
around the turn and bested the rest. NAUGHTY NIKO stalked the leaders inside a pair of rivals, saved ground to the stretch and failed to rally.
MAGNIFICENT stalked three deep to the turn, asked around the bend, came four wide into the drive and failed to menace.

AH JEEZ steadied slightly when losing his path early, chased along the inside into and around the bend, guided out in the stretch, rallied outside the top pair
and headed HELLADIC with a sixteenth to go and drove clear. HELLADIC sprinted clear early, showed the way into the turn, felt some pressure from
outside then moved clear again on the turn, drifted out midstretch and yielded to the winner in the final sixteenth. MAS RAPIDO (GB) was closest in pursuit
early moving off the inside, applied some pressure around the turn then lost touch again around the bend, stayed within striking distance down the lane, lost
his path midstretch and kept on for a clear third. JORDAN got shuffled between rivals early, trailed along the inside into the stretch and lacked a rally.
TANGLEDUPINGREY was off slow on the outside, stalked outside a rival into the turn, traveled three then two wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
BALADI broke a step slow, chased inside near the back, moved out to the two path on the turn, tipped out in the lane and surged in the final furlong to drive
past MORAWETH late. MORAWETH stalked the pace outside a rival four wide into the turn, came three wide into the stretch, drew alongside MULTI
PLATINUM and took a bumped from that rival midstretch, took over shortly after and got run down by the winner late. CHIPPER bobbled leaving the gate,
went two to three wide around the bend, angled in at the top of the stretch and put in a mild late bid to earn the show. MULTI PLATINUM went up to duel for
the lead from inside, inched ahead leaving the backstretch, moved clear nearing the five-sixteenths pole, drifted out and bumped challenger approaching the
sixteenth pole, relinquished the lead shortly after and flattened to fourth. TROUBADOUR broke a step slow, tracked five wide into the turn, four wide into the
lane and lacked a bid. MITICO brushed with outer rival early, dueled for command then pressed leaving the backstretch, could not keep up around the turn,
came two wide into the lane and weakened. ROGUE SON sat off the pace off the rail, rounded the bend three wide and failed to menace. CANDY FOR
CARMEL broke well then dropped back to last, took the turn four then five wide and was not a factor. LAUGHING LEGACY got brushed from inside early,
stalked three wide into the first turn, lost ground while angling to the rail around the bend and faded.

Footnotes
DURANTE dueled for the lead from outside early then ceded command around the clubhouse turn, re-engaged the leader with three furlongs remaining,
dueled around the far turn, cleared in upper stretch, drifted late and brushed the runner-up and was able to hold. PERCOLATE (IRE) stalked two wide or
outside a rival, roused around the far turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, launched a bid from outside entering the final sixteenth, got floated out and
brushed by DURANTE and could not get by. FLINT STROLL tracked three deep then two wide early, traveled in mid-pack up the back, went two wide then
a bit off the rail into the lane, moved out in the drive and gained the show. CAISSON was off slow and dropped back early, trailed off the rail then advanced
outside rivals in the middle stages, came four wide into the stretch and summoned a mild rally to round out the superfecta. ONCOMING broke through the
gate and was reloaded, went two then three wide outside rivals on the first turn, moved into range up the backstretch, entered the lane three wide and could
not rally. ENCODE dueled for the lead from inside then cleared around the first turn, set the pace up the back stretch, challenged with three furlongs
remaining, dueled to the stretch, could not go on with DURANTE in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. PETRUCHIO sat off the pace outside a
rival then checked between rivals at the three-quarter pole, went two to three wide on the far turn and could not rally. TISQUANTUM stumbled leaving the
gate, unhurried and moved inside early, coaxed on the far turn and tipped out to go between rivals, got put in tight and checked at the quarter pole and had
little left for the drive. EL JOY raced on the inside near the back, pulled from the half-mile pole to the seven-sixteenths marker, angled three wide on the far
turn and was not a factor. KAZUHIKO (AUS) away quickly in the beginning then settled on the inside, moved closer up the backstretch, dropped back on the
far turn, pulled up in the lane and walked off.

aim four wide into the stretch, rallied six deep and took over late and was able to hold over the runner-up. SCRIPT raced outside a rival near the back early,
came three wide into the stretch, steered out widest in the lane, surged late and missed. SPYCATCHER was closest in pursuit from outside early then
shifted out briefly on the clubhouse turn, went up to apply pressure between rivals on the backstretch, dueled around the far turn and into the lane, took over
midstretch and yielded to the top pair late. ST ANTHONY stalked the pace on the inside, went between into the backstretch then traveled outside a rival,
tipped out and bumped in upper stretch then came out and bumped again late and kept on for a minor award. CLUTCH HITTER was off slow on the inside,
pulled early while being reserved, remained under a hold up the backstretch, roused two wide into the drive, lacked room upper to midstretch then tried to
move out to a clear path and failed to find room late. TIME TO PARTY stalked the pace on the inside, saved ground to the stretch, checked off the heels of
the leader at the top of the lane, tipped out and rallied between but needed more late. DEGREE OF RISK stalked off the inside and steadied briefly on the
clubhouse turn, moved up outside the top pair, vied three deep on the far turn, lost touch leaving the bend, got bumped from inside in upper stretch,
continued to give chase, got bumped and put in tight quarters and checked late halting any momentum. CRAZY DREAMS broke a step slow and got
bumped back at the start, trailed on the inside to the stretch, steered out and had to steady late when running up behind rivals. LAW ABIDING sped to the

lead then turned away that rival in the final sixteenth. SUGAR SUGAR stalked the pace on the inside, tipped out at the quarter pole and took aim at the
leader into the stretch, lugged in and bumped BALI DANCER in upper stretch, fought to the sixteenth pole and faltered late. LA CHIQUIS showed early
speed then chased the top pair three deep, came four wide into the lane, could not summon the needed rally and churned on to hold the show. GOLDEN
HALO came out leaving the gate, chased off the pace four then five wide on the turn and got edged for the show. SUPERCENTS veered out in the
beginning, traveled near the back while wide, came four wide into the stretch, moved out and improved position. WORTHINESS broke a step slow, sat off
the pace, driven three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. VEGAS DREAM stumbled badly leaving the gate, raced wide near the back early, under a drive
six wide turning for home and failed to menace. TIGER'S WISH dueled for command from outside, pressed to the five-sixteenths pole then chased the
leader three wide leaving the turn and faded. AWSOME DONNA chased outside a rival then between into the turn, ran two wide around the bend and
weakened. HEAVEN'S GHOST trailed on the inside into the stretch and was not a factor.
