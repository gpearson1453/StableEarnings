Footnotes
GUARD saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through during the drive and was up with a rush in the final sixteenth. ALFIE SOLOMONS set the early
pace racing slightly off the rail, responded when headed nearing the quarter pole, drifted out slightly entering the stretch, regained the lead inside the eighth
pole, but was unable to resist the winner late. MONTAUK DADDY prompted the early pace from along the inside, was in tight leaving the five-eighths pole,
angled out entering the turn, moved up to gain a slight lead nearing the quarter pole, dueled for the lead ti inside the eighth pole and weakened slightly late.
HIGHER AUTHORITY was allowed to settle in stride while racing four-wide on the turn and lacked a rally. RETALIATED was forwardly placed while racing
three-wide on the turn and tired during the drive.

Footnotes
DAY TRADE was allowed to settle in stride early, moved up strongly on the turn while racing three-wide, took the lead nearing the quarter pole and
gradually drew clear. LET ME LOVE YOU was reserved off the early pace, raced behind a wall of horses on the turn, angled out four-wide nearing the
quarter pole looking for room and finished strongly. O GANGSTER prompted the pace while racing two-wide, responded to pressure during the drive and
held on well for the show. DON'T LET GO was unhurried early, rallied six-wide the final quarter and was gaining ground late. IDRATHERBEBLESSED was
prominent throughout, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole and flattened out during the drive. RIO MOON dropped back early, rallied
four-wide into the stretch, angled out for room nearing the three-sixteenths pole and failed to seriously threaten. INVASIVE saved ground while lacking early
speed and failed to menace. CAMBIASO was allowed to settle in stride while racing five-wide and lacked a rally when asked. GRIMES saved ground
stalking the early pace, angled out nearing the five-sixteenths pole but had no response. GABE was forwardly placed early racing along the inside and tired.
PLENTY OF TIME saved ground setting the pace for five furlongs and gave way readily when headed.

Footnotes
MINT stalked the while racing three-wide, moved up to catch Guided Arrow nearing the eighth pole, dueled for the lead from that point and proved best in a
stiff drive. FROSTED DIAMOND was allowed to settle in stride, angled out around Nimrods on the turn, then angled back to the inside and finished fast.
GUIDED ARROW prompted the pace from along the inside, took the lead after five furlongs, responded when challenged by the winner but wasn't quite
good enough in a game effort. TAP THE CANDY bobbled at the start, then was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and gained his best stride
too late. MADISON LUVS DUKE was forwardly placed while racing along the inside but lacked a rally. BOLD MEDICATION was bumped at the start, then
raced close up to the leaders and went evenly late. ALFIO dropped back early, rallied six-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. LIAM THE
BRAVE was bumped at the start., then was unhurried, came seven-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. CLOSE KNIT broke in to bump Liam the
Brave at the start, then allowed to settle in stride, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. VALE settled in the middle of the pack, steadied
briefly nearing the half mile pole in traffic, then raced three-wide and weakened during the drive. NIMRODS set the pace for five furlongs racing along the
inside and gave way readily when headed. MY FAVORITE UNCLE dropped far back early, was distanced, then pulled up in the stretch and walked off
following the race.

Footnotes
CAN'T HUSH THIS saved ground while being forwardly placed, angled out three-wide nearing the quarter pole, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and
prevailed under pressure. LEBLON was reserved off the early place, moved up entering the stretch, lacked room running up on horses nearing the
three-sixteenths pole, angled out for room and finished fast. CARMICHAEL stalked the pace while racing two-wide, offered a bid entering the stretch, but
lacked the needed late response. TEST PILOT saved ground setting the pace into the stretch and weakened slightly late. TUANIS saved ground while being
unhurried and passed tiring rivals. KING'S OVATION was prominently placed early while racing between horses and weakened. BOURBON THUNDER
prompted the early pace while racing three-wide and tired.

BOURBON CREED was allowed to settle in stride, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole, took the lead coming to the eighth pole and gradually drew
clear. STAND FOR FREEDOM was unhurried early, rallied three-wide into the stretch, angled further out nearing the eighth pole and finished strongly. FAR
FROM FINAL prompted the pace while racing two-wide, responded to pressure and held on fairly well during the drive. BET HE'S READY saved ground
setting the pace, drifted out nearing the quarter pole and weakened. INSOLITO was forwardly placed along the inside but lacked a rally. CYCLONE dropped
back early and failed to seriously threaten. DOG RED was allowed to settle in stride, moved up five-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole and then
flattened out during the drive. ROCK WITH YOU gave way after showing brief speed.

NEUTRALIZE disputed the issue throughout from along the outside of Malibu Toast and proved narrowly best in a prolonged drive. MIGHTY MADISON was
reserved off the early pace, rallied three-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished fast. MALIBU TOAST saved ground setting the pace, responded when
asked and held on gamely during the drive. EFFORTLESSLYELGANT was allowed to settle in stride, steadied nearing the three-eighths pole while in tight,
angled out nearing the stretch and gained best stride too late. HIGH CLASS was unhurried early, moved up five-wide on the turn and was gaining ground
late. BABY GOT BACKSPIN saved ground while being forwardly placed and then lacked room during the drive. IN COLOR was allowed to settle in stride,
checked in traffic nearing the three-eighths pole, then moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole and then flattened out. TANGO ZULU was
reserved off the early pace, came six-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. MISS J D hopped at the start to get away behind her field, then raced in the
middle of the pack and failed to threaten. VARSITY BLONDE prompted the pace for a half mile while racing three-wide and weakened. EXHIBIT HALL
dropped back early, came five-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. MALLY'S MONSOON dropped back early and failed to menace.

TONAL IMPACT was unhurried early, rallied six-wide into the stretch, angled further out during the drive and finished fast to be up in the final strides.
RUNWAY MAGIC prompted the pace from along the outside, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and just failed to last. PAYNE was reserved off the early
pace, split rivals nearing the quarter pole and finished fast. EMERALD EXPRESS was forwardly placed racing two-wide, ducked out nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and finished willingly when straightened. RODERICK saved ground setting the pace into the stretch and weakened during the drive.
SUMMER SPLASH saved ground while being prominently place and tired late.

Footnotes
GIROOVIN prompted the pace set by Harold's Cloud, took the lead from that one nearing the quarter pole and gradually drew clear. FUJIN was unhurried
early, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out five-wide nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished full of run. BOOSTER SHOT stalked pace
from along the inside, swung out to come three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. MOGUL CRACK was forwardly placed while racing
three-wide on the turn, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. HAROLD'S CLOUD saved ground setting the pace for a half mile and weakened
when headed. HUNTER'S DRIVE was forwardly placed while racing four-wide on the turn and tired. OWN THE FIELD was reserved off the early pace,
came three-wide into the stretch but lacked a response when asked. SLAMMING IT dropped back early and failed to threaten. TIME THE MARKET vied for
the early lead from along the inside and gave way after three furlongs.
