continued gamely. SHETALKSTOMUCH angled inside trailing early, moved out advancing into the stretch, loomed a threat but hung. TOURING
MARYANNE dropped back outside and was never in contention. VANISHING FAITH vied outside winner for half a mile and stopped.

Footnotes
OBSTINATE raced three wide early, stalked close up outside, bid four wide at the half mile marker, took over, drew clear on the turn and pulled away under
urging. LULA'S ROADRUNNER tracked close up on the inside, bid between rivals at the half mile pole, then rallied inside in the stretch drive and earned the
place spot. R TENDERONI raced three wide early, stalked two wide, moved up three wide entering the far turn, rallied outside in the stretch and was
outkicked for second. WISHES AND DREAMS was off slowly, raced two wide off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn and bested the others. FED
POLICY raced off the pace, made a rail bid at the half mile marker, was steadied soon after, then chased and tired. MISS LOYALTY stumbled at the start
and was off slowly, raced off the pace with an inside trip and did not factor. AWESOMENEWYEAR set the early pace, dueled passing the half mile pole,
then chased and gave way.

WINNING TIME took control early, widened throughout, drew away to a commanding lead and was under wraps late. UNCLE DAR raced in closest pursuit
of the winner all the way and proved easily second best. THESEGUYSGOTGAME prompted just off the pace outside and faltered. CAPITAL CONQUEST
lacked speed chasing wide and lacked a rally. RESPIRATOR lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. ZOPPI FISCHBEIN broke slowest then caught
stopping opponents late. CLASSIC UNION raced wide throughout and weakened steadily. MINXZHIPPSDONTLEYE flashed speed inside then gave way
readily.

Footnotes
WE READY stalked two wide. chased on the turn, rallied outside rivals entering the stretch, took over, drew clear and held well under urging. LATE TO THE
SHOW raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up inside on the turn, angled out entering the stretch, rallied and dug in gamely for second. JOKEMEISTER
dueled two wide for command, while being pushed along by a riderless horse to the outside, was bothered a bit by the loose horse entering the stretch and
weakened. NO RHYTHM was bumped at the start, tracked on the inside, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. IMAGINE THIS raced off the rail,
off the pace and lacked a rally. MYQUIST was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside and did not factor. WEGOTTAGUY was bumped at the start,
raced two wide early, inside on the turn and tired. POP POP SUSI dueled inside of JOKEMESITER and the riderless horse, dueled on the turn and faded.
BATTLE OF BERLIN stumbled badly at the start and lost the rider. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the start, the race was declared official.

Footnotes
WHATA GUY moved close up in the two path before half a mile then drew off increasing his advantage to the finish driving. LT'S JACKNTHEBOX drifted out
early causing crowding, set a pressured pace inside and held the place while unable to handle the winner. DUBROVNIK carried out and bothered into the
first turn, advanced outside and closed well. TOUGH WORKOUT settled just off the leaders inside and proved empty in the stretch. SWEET PARI chased
inside and lacked a rally. OLD BEAU forced the pace for five furlongs and gave way. GO SKIPPY GO dropped back early and gave way readily. KANE
crowded soon after the start causing his rider to lose his irons. DRUNKEN BRIDGE stalked the pacesetters three wide and began stopping on the final turn.
Following a stewards inquiry and an objections by the third finisher against the second finisher for causing interference soon after the start, LT'S
JACKNTHEBOX was disqualified and placed eighth.

Footnotes
PRINCE FILIP set the pace racing with a clear early lead, moved off the inside turning for home, responded, dug in gamely in deep stretch and held well for
the win. ZAEVION chased between rivals early, chased on the turn, rallied outside in the stretch drive and dug in gamely to the end. SHANGHAI
SUPERFLY chased five wide early, drifted in slightly near EXTREME FORCE, then three wide on the turn, continued in the two path through the lane and
held on to prevail in the show photo. AHSAD raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn, rallied mildly on the rail and just missed for third.
SPLITZVILLE was outrun early and closed belatedly. MYSTIC LINK raced two wide off the pace, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally.
EXTREME FORCE raced four wide early, three wide on turn and faded. MACH TRIAL raced off the rail, off the pace, four wide on the turn and faded. A
Jockey's Objection by the rider of EXTREME FORCE against SHANGHAI SUPERFLY was dismissed.

Footnotes
AMERICAN PATROL set a measured pace inside, repelled challenges then gradually widened under moderate urging. IRISH CORK prompted the winner
for three quarters and continued willingly to be easily second best. LOOKIN AT ROSES raced close up, moved wide all the way and flattened out in the final
furlong. YODEL E. A. WHO steadied in tight on the first turn, saved ground and lacked a bid. SOUND OFF lagged far behind then passed fading rivals.
SHOOGER RAY TOO sluggish early, raced within range three wide and faltered. BOURBON CALLING settled just off the leaders inside then gave way on
the final turn.
