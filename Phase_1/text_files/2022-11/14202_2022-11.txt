Footnotes
HERE'S WALDO was away alertly and crossed over to set the pace while clear, then drew out on the turn and drew off leaving the turn and was kept to left
handed crop urging to prove much the best. HOLD THE IRISH tracked the pace on the inside and then chased the winner on the turn, proved to be no
match for that rival while clearly second best. MIDDLE EARTH was rated along three to four wide and weakened, bested rest. EYE OF GUNFIGHTER
showed no speed and failed to menace. WICKED CRAZY tracked the pace three wide and stopped.

SUPER ROCKER was reserved early four wide, made a wide move on the turn and hit the front leaving the furlong marker, then held on late to prove best,
driving. TREJO was allowed to settle early, was two wide on the turn and moved into contention by the quarter pole, swung out six wide leaving the turn and
closed well to just miss. SLIPPERY WHEN WET was reserved early, advanced on the inside on the turn and made a inside bid leaving the turn but needed
more late. GRAND ESCAPE dueled for the lead two wide and made a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole and faded late. TIEMPO PERFECTO chased
the pace three to four wide on the turn, angled out in the lane but had no kick. RUN HAPPY PAPPY dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened in the
lane. BRENTFORD pressed the pace three wide and weakened.

QUEEN ROSEMARY was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the turn, hit the front nearing the furlong marker and then dug in gamely late to
hold on, driving. DILLY DILLY PHILLY was allowed to settle early, three wide on the turn, shifted out and came five wide into the lane, closed well to just
miss. MEMPHIS MAFIA was reserved early, advanced on the inside on the turn, then finished well on the inside, bested rest. RISQUE'S JEWEL stumbled
badly at the start, was far back early, came five wide into the lane and had a belated rally for the last spot in the superfecta. HIPNOTIZADA was away alertly
to set a fast pace and weakened the final furlong. SEVEN YEARS LATER tracked the pace two to three wide and then was empty in the drive. HIDDEN
SPRINGS chased the pace on the inside and stopped.

NAUTILUS was well placed two wide early, shifted out three wide to follow the move of DR. BLARNEY on the turn three wide, then hit the front nearing the
furlong marker and drew out to prove best under a mild drive. DR BLARNEY was in between ribvals into the first turn, worked way to the outside and stalked
the pace four wide, made a three wide bid entering the turn and shook clear but was headed nearing the furlong marker and was no match for the winner,
second best. EVENT PARTY was rated early on the inside, shifted out to be three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and was along for the show
award. CRITICAL THINKING set a pressured pace two wide and weakened. CAERUS chased the pace four to three wide and had no rally. MAXIMUM
IMPACT lacked a rally. COOL COMEDIAN stumbled at the start and failed to menace. P JS SILVER DUKE pressed the pace on the inside and tired.

FLOR DE SOMBRA bobbled slightly at the start, chased the pace and made a four wide move on the turn, then continued that move leaving the turn, then
drew out in the furlong grounds under mild right handed crop urging. LATE FROST dueled for the lead on the inside and made a bid on the turn to shake
clear, then was headed by the winner nearing the furlong marker and proved to be no match for that rival, clearly second best. LINDALOVESGOLD was
allowed to settle on the inside, angled out five wide leaving the turn and had a belated rally to clearly best the rest. I CAME TO DANCE was reserved early
and three wide on the turn, came six wide into the lane and improved late going by the tiring rivals. CELTIC TIGER dueled for the lead two wide and
weakened. MIDNIGHT PARADE stalked the pace and made a mild bid three wide on the turn and then was empty in the lane, vanned off.

Footnotes
JUSTKISSMYGRITS set the pace on the inside and shook clear on the turn, then shifted off the inside leaving the turn and was three wide by the three
sixteenth marker and clear, then held sway late to prove best, driving. SHATTER ME was well placed early two wide, then was on the inside on the turn,
angled out in the lane and rallied well but could not get by the winner, second best. GOLDEN LAW chased the pace and made a mild bid four wide on the
turn but had no late kick, bested rest. BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD was allowed to settle early and lacked a rally. STARSHIP REINA stalked the pace three
wide and weakened. RAECHEL'S RISK chased the pace on the inside and weakened. HIT A HOMER HONEY showed brief speed on the inside and was
through early.
