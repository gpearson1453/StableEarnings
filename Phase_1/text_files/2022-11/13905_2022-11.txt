Footnotes
BACHELORETTE exchanged contact with Can't Figure leaving the gate then stalked off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced close off the
rail on the far turn, took the lead while drifting into the stretch and dug in determinedly to inch clear the final yards. JACCACI rated a short lead inside, came
under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, gave up the nod into the lane but dug in gamely to late
stretch before reluctantly yielding. LINDA'S TAJ stalked the early pace about the three path, picked up the chase at the three eighths pole, raced off the rail
on the far turn then flattened in the lane. FORT ZANNA saved ground on the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and passed rivals in the lane. NICE QUIST settled toward the inside on the first turn, picked up the
chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail but showed little in the lane. CAN'T FIGURE exchanged contact with Bachelorette
leaving the gate, ran in the two and three paths of the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. LICENSE TO CARRY became a bit edgy
in the gate then saved ground.

WHALE OF A TIME broke in and made contact with Long Legs Louise then rated a slim lead inside, was met nearing the half mile pole, recovered the
advantage past the three eighths, drew clear at the rail midway on the far turn and held on under steady stretch handling. BREADMAN'S ROSEBUD
rounded the first turn in the three path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn, drifted into the lane but
finished well to close the gap. SARAH'S WARRIOR settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, ran in the three and four paths
of the far turn and came along for third the final strides. EX RATED saved ground racing well back from early contention then eased out into the backstretch,
bid toward the five sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. AIM'S JUBILEE broke outward and made contact with Long
Legs Louise then stalked the early pace off the rail, moved to even terms toward the half mile pole and dueled with the advantage through the backstretch,
was caught leaving the three eighths, raced off the rail on the far turn and weakened into the lane. MISS LAUREN became fractious in the gate then saved
ground on the first turn and was through after a half mile. LONG LEGS LOUISE was jostled soundly at the break and saved ground.

FREEDOM RIDER stalked the early pace off the rail then took the lead between horses at the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came under pressure
toward the three eighths, dueled clear approaching the quarter pole and was steadily handled in the lane. NIGHT BOSS showed the way at the rail early on
then stalked inside from the three quarter pole, gave chase and moved to the three path leaving the three eighths pole, raced close through the far turn and
finished well. SASSY KING was shuffled back early and settled well off the pace in the two and three paths, bid past the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn about the five path and cleared third in later yards. LET US MAKE GOLD settled in the three path, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the
far turn about the three path, eased outward toward the head of the lane and ran evenly in the lane. MAILMAN'S A FLYER rounded the first turn about the
three path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three path and showed little in the lane. ACROSS THE AISLE saved
ground. HAPPY YEARS made contact with LIQUID LOUIE and bobbled shortly after the break then settled in the three path, picked up the chase from the
seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened. The latter was bumped after the break then saved ground, picked up the chase from
the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn. ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) rounded the first turn in the five path then stalked from the three path,
challenged toward the three eighths pole but dropped back off the rail toward the quarter and gave way into the lane.

PRIMAL DESTINY was hustled clear while tapering to the inside and rated the early pace, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, raced near
the rail on the turn and was steadily encouraged to hold off the game stretch challenge of FREE DANCER, who gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the
turn and dug in gamely through the stretch. EMPEROROFTHEDARK chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path and just lasted for
third. NEWS FLASH chased then steadied behind a narrowing opening in the vicinity of the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the turn, finished well and
just missed third. INSIDE RISK raced well back, bid past the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn about the four path and ran evenly in the lane.
BAYTOWN FROSTY gave chase, rounded the turn about the five path then flattened. BAYTOWN WARRIOR gave chase through the backstretch, rounded
the turn in the four path, angled in at the head of the lane then weakened. The Stewards reviewed then dismissed a claim of foul against the rider of
Emperorofthedark for alleged interference in the vicinity of the three eighths pole, lodged by the rider of News Flash.

Footnotes
FULL MOON LOVER chased toward the inside, was eased out and made contact with Sparkle Sprinkle approaching the three sixteenths pole, dueled to the
lead mid-stretch, drew briefly clear late yards and just lasted. LADY STORM chased outside, rounded the turn about the five path, dug in from the head of
the lane to take second late yards and just missed. CANVAS ART chased inside, ran at the rail on the turn and finished well to take third the final yards.
COLLEGE KID closed to the lead approaching the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, ran at the rail on the turn but weakened approaching
mid-stretch. SPARKLE SPRINKLE pressured the pace through the backstretch, was bumped outward and into Got Your Number approaching the three
sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the turn and ran evenly down the lane. BET THE QUEEN was not a factor. AT THE HALF was never a factor then
angled wide to avoid a fallen rider midway on the turn. GOT YOUR NUMBER engaged in close chase through the backstretch, but was bumped outward
toward the three sixteenths pole and lost her rider. After a Stewards inquiry and subsequent claim of foul against the rider of Full Moon Lover for
interference midway on the turn, lodged by the rider of Sparkle Sprinkle, the latter was disqualified to last place.

CLEARLY VISIBLE chased through the backstretch and raced two deep on the turn, eased to the three path leaving the turn, dug in for the lead in the final
yards and ran clear under the wire. CAPTAIN SAM dueled to the lead nearing the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, dueled clear at the rail
midway on the turn, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn but was caught in the final yards and flattened toward the wire. NANCYSAIDSO chased
outside, rounded the turn about the five path, finished well to take third in the final strides and was gaining on the runner-up. ADABEL chased, rounded the
turn in the three path then flattened the final yards. FOREST HALO angled to the outside to give chase, rounded the turn about the six path and finished
well widest. WARRIOR EMPRESS contested the pace two deep, dropped back off the rail midway on the turn and weakened in the lane. MAD MARY gave
chase then flattened in the three path of the turn. FUDGE CAKE chased inside, ran at the rail on the turn then weakened.
