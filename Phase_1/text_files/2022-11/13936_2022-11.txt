HAY NINETEEN tracked the pace and made a three wide bid leaving the turn, hit the front nearing the sixteenth marker and was clear, then kept TERPEYE
safe late while being ridden out, confident handling. TERPEYE was void of early speed, came wide into the lane while advancing, closed well late to gain
the place award. HIPNOTIZADA set a fast pace while clear, tyhen was headed nearing the sixteenth marker and faded, bested rest. STORMBEAM was
settled back early, then saved ground on the turn and had a belated rally on the inside for the last spot in the superfecta. FAIRY DUST was settled early,
raced three wide on the turn and lacked a rally. SUSIKIN chased the pace and saved ground on the turn and swung out three wide leaving the turn and

Footnotes
JADE'S DREAM was well rated along the inside, eased out leaving the five eighths marker, then was three wide entering the far turn and made a four wide
bid by the quarter pole, lugged in slightly nearing the furlong marker, was quickly corrected, then edged clear to gain a short lead leaving the furlong marker,
then held on late to prove best, driving. MIDDLE EARTH prompted the pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to vie for command between rivals by the
quarter pole, then came in slightly nearing the furlong marker bumping SOUPER EMPEROR causing that rival to steady in tight, then ran on to just miss
between rivals. SOUPER EMPEROR set the pace on the inside, then was headed nearing the quarter pole, then had to steady while in tight nearing the
furlong marker and was bumped, then kept on willingly. SWEEPIN HARD lacked a rally. SOUL STORY was rated along four wide and came five wide into
the drive and was empty. The jockey on number one claimed foul against the winner for interference nearing the furlong marker, after reviewing the replays
the STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED JADE'S DREAM for interference in the stretch and placed her third.

stalked the pace three wide, then was slowly gainibng in the final furlong, second best. BERHANU was off a step slow, then rushed up the inside and set a
pressured pace and dueled on the turn, then weakened, held show award. THE GREAT CASBY was taken back early, started to unwind leaving the five
sixteenths, came six wide into the lane and had a belated rally to just miss the show award. COMMISSIONER BIGGS hit the gate coming out at the start,

Footnotes
VENOMOUS STATE was well placed along the inside, advanced along the inside on the turn, then angled out nearing the quarter pole for racing room,
made a three wide bid leaving the turn and dueled for command by the furlong marker and then slowly edged away late to prove best, driving. WAHOOWA
WAHOOWA set a pressured pace inside of a trio while in the three path, dropped down to the two path on the turn and was clear by the quarter pole, then
was headed by the furlong marker and could not go with the winner late while clearly second best. SPIKES SHIRL was allowed to settle early, saved gorund
on the turn, swung out five wide for the drive and rallied well. GRAND WISER stalked the pace five wide, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole but
flattened out. THE BEST CANDY broke in a tangle at the start and was outrun early, came six wide into the lane and had a belated rally. EQUAL JUSTICE
pressed the pace four wide and then was three wide on the turn and weakened. HOORAY FOR HARVEY lacked a rally.
