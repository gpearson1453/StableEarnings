pace while two wide, was used up then gave way. ATTA PARTY raced three wide on the turn then made a bid but failed to menace. WHAT ABOUT JIMMY
was inside and saving ground on the turn but was no threat in the end. GRANITO DE ORO was unhurried early and failed to menace. AFTER BURN was
unhurried early and four wide on the turn and no threat. GIST raced two wide on the turn and gave way.
