WOW RUN set a pressured pace on the inside while in the two path, shook clear leaving the turn and held sway late to prove best under strong handling.
DOUBLE TIME BAY was rated along early and saved ground on the turn, closed well on the inside to just miss. KNOCKDOWN KID tracked the pace three
wide and came four wide into the lane, then was slowly gaining late. COMMUNICATION FAIL pressed the pace three wide and faded in the lane.
AGGRANDIZE was settled three wide on the turn, came four wide into the drive and then angled out to the far outside and had a belated rally. SCYNTZ
chased the pace two wide and weakened. MR DUBAI was settled early on the inside and then was eased in the lane and walked off.

urging to prove much the best. THE ROBERT was reserved early, made a wide run on the turn and came six wide into the lane and finished well to gain the
place award. POLITICAL was four wide into the first turn, then settled back early, advanced four wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane and was
outfinished for the place award. MASTER OF WAR was settled early, made a four wide move on the turn and weakened. AULD LANGE SYNE was settled
back early on the inside, then passed the tiring rivals. MOROCCO was settled early on the inside,advanced two wide on the turn and tired. ROLLING
PALISADES chased the early pace and made a mild three wide bid on the turn and tired. COMPOUND IT set the pace on the inside for five furlongs and
