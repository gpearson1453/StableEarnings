Footnotes
SHE'S XTREMELY HOT broke awkwardly, grazed the gate, and came slowly into stride, raced at the rear of the main group around the far turn, pulled to
the lead from near the three sixteenths, struck the front inside of ELEGANCE N TONIC near the eleven sixteenths, opened up in the three path on the far
turn under her own initiative, was pushed along in upper stretch, maintained a clear lead through midstretch, carried a diminishing lead late but narrowly
held on. ELEGANCE N TONIC set the early pace inside while prompted by GREEN BANANAS, was headed from the inside by SHE'S XTREMELY HOT by
the eleven sixteenths, tracked the leader from there, continued in tracking position in the two path on the far turn, swung into the lane in the five path, kept
on in pursuit of SHE'S XTREMELY HOT, gained well on the leader late but missed. READY AT MIDNIGHT settled toward the rear of the main group,
chased inside foes down the backstretch, was pushed along in the three path from midfield around the far turn, was driven in the three path in upper stretch,
and chased on mildly to prove best of the rest while never threatening the top two. MAIDEN ROCK showed no early speed, continued to trail down the back
straight, raced in the five path on the far turn, began to improve near the five sixteenths, swung into the lane in the seven path, drifted out and passed tiring
horses. SEQUAYA raced four wide early, settled back into the first turn to chase midfield, chased in the five path around the far turn, came into the lane in
the four path and lacked the needed rally. GREEN BANANAS prompted the pace two wide around the first turn, tracked the new leader down the back
straight and in the three to four path around the far turn, came into the lane in the five path and emptied out. DRAGONFLY KISSES raced in range three
wide early, settled back to track into the first turn, chased between horses down the back straight, faded in the three path around the far turn and had no
more in the lane.

Footnotes
TIZ HOPPIN, urged between rivals prompting the pace from the outset, angled to the rail on the turn while moving to challenge for command, edged clear in
upper stretch and just lasted under firm encouragement. KANFU angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the turn, tipped out three wide
racing into upper stretch, split rivals in that path midstretch and continued willingly to close the gap. RARE ACTION ATTACK, off last, settled outside a rival
in the last flight racing to the turn, shifted out entering the lane while finding his best stride late and gained position between foes while prevailing for a share.
RENTAL POOL settled between foes in early stages, angled to the inside racing through the turn, then tipped out in the stretch to make some mild progress
between rivals. APRIL'S GEM, urged to a forward placing four wide tracking just off the first flight racing to the turn, was steadied momentarily racing in that
path nearing upper stretch, then continued evenly outside foes in the last quarter. HEY HEY was rated along the inside tracking behind the second flight,
saved ground to the lane while making some progress between calls but was outkicked in the last furlong. BOBBIE TOO TOO, urged three deep prompting
the pace from the outset into the turn, moved to press the issue nearing upper stretch but gave way leaving the furlong marker. ORNERY ANGEL tracked
off the second flight between foes racing to the turn, shifted out five wide in the stretch and came up empty late. PRINCESS CONSUELA, slow into stride,
proved no threat. APOLLO U ANYWHERE, urged to the lead along the inside, tipped off the rail to dispute the issue between rivals on the turn and gave
way in the drive. MIDSHIP LADY, caught five wide tracking off the second flight racing into the turn, was fanned six wide entering the stretch and faded in
the drive. GOLD MAKER, urged between rivals pursuing the leaders under pressure into the turn, gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
MY REDEMPTION chased two wide, bid in the three to four path on the far turn, was driven into the lane in the five path, engaged outside of CHRISTMAS
PRESENT past the three sixteenths, took over approaching the sixteenth and drifted in late. CHRISTMAS PRESENT prompted the pace outside of
CHOCOLATE BUNNY, led past the half while taking pressure from WHERE'D THE DAY GO, carried a narrow lead into the lane, kept on when challenged
by MY REDEMPTION past the three sixteenths, vied to the sixteenth but was only second best late. WHERE'D THE DAY GO tracked the pace three deep
around the first turn, raced keenly three wide into the back straight, tracked the leading pair, attended three wide into the far turn, prompted outside of
CHRISTMAS PRESENT in the three path, was driven two wide in upper stretch, proved no match for the latter, and chased on best of the rest. BETTER
THINK TWICE tracked the pace inside of MY REDEMPTION through the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, took up in the three path near the
three eighths behind the weakening CHOCOLATE BUNNY, was urged between horses in the six path into the lane, and chased on mildly. KNIEVEL raced
two wide in the rear pair early, inched forward past the five eighths, chased in the five path on the far turn, came six wide into the lane and had no kick.
PIRATE BIRD raced at the inside of the rear pair early, continued near the rear down the back straight, raced in the rear pair in the four to five path on the
far turn, floated out near the three eighths and bumped ICECAP, and came up empty in the lane. ICECAP settled toward the rear around the first turn, raced
at the inside of the rear pair down the back straight, was bumped by PIRATE BIRD while racing in the five to six path near the three eighths, floated eight
wide into the lane and lacked a rally. CHOCOLATE BUNNY set the early pace while pressured by CHRISTMAS PRESENT, was headed past the half,
weakened in the two to three path on the far turn and had no more inside in the lane.

Footnotes
CELEBRATING HAL broke readily, was urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, tipped out racing into upper stretch gaining a
clear advantage and continued with a game effort through the stretch to hold TAHOE RUN to the end under firm left handed encouragement. The latter
angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders racing into the turn, tipped out to the three path midstretch while moving to close the gap on the winner but
was outkicked. SHARP AZ NAILS tracked off the second flight racing four wide into the turn, was fanned to the six path entering the stretch but continued
with interest outside foes to narrowly prevail for a share. HIGHLY PERFECT, urged to contend four wide in the opening stages, angled to the rail racing past
the half mile marker, saved ground on the turn, then continued willingly near the inside to close the gap on the leaders while just missing for a share.
UNDERTOW, urged prompting the pace outside the eventual winner through the backstretch into the turn, gave way nearing midstretch. SNOWMOBILE
was urged three deep between foes pursuing the leaders on the backstretch, shifted four wide into the lane and faded into the stretch. SLAVA UKRAINI,
reluctant to load, angled to the inside tracking off the first flight in early stages and gave way after a half. WESLAN tracked off the second flight between
foes on the backstretch and retreated early. ALL ABOUT CROGE was off slowly, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
KHOZIE'S GHOST was sent for speed and took the lead outside of GO STORMIN GIRL near the five eighths, set the pace two wide on the turn while
hounded from the inside by that foe, continued to vie two wide in upper stretch, cleared past the three sixteenths, and held driving. OWEN'S PLEASURE
settled toward the rear, raced inside of COWGIRL KIMMIE in the three path on the turn, began to improve past the five sixteenths, rallied between horses in
upper stretch, came out and bumped BIRDIE BE GONE while doing so, found her best near the sixteenth mark despite drifting out, and missed. INDAWIN
settled at the rear, trailed in the four path on the turn, swung out near the center of the track into the lane, began to rally under a drive, and came on
belatedly for show. GO STORMIN GIRL was restless in the gate, broke sharply nonetheless and led in the opening furlong, attended the pace inside of
KHOZIE'S GHOST past the five eighths, continued to goad inside of that foe around the turn and into the lane, proved no match from the three sixteenths,
flattened out and lost show late. SWEET CONFUSION broke a step slowly, raced near the rear outside of INDAWIN early, advanced three wide from near
the nine sixteenths, sustained the bid four wide on the tun, was urged four wide in range nearing the quarter, but proved no match into upper stretch and
flattened out. COWGIRL KIMMIE was fractious and reared in the gate, broke outward and bumped BIRDIE BE GONE in the opening strides, chased
midfield early, raced toward the rear outside of OWEN'S PLEASURE in the four path on the turn, came into the lane five wide and passed tiring horses.
AUNT STELLA was restless in the gate, tracked the leading pair down the backstretch, tracked the leading line in the two to three path down the back
straight, proved no match under a drive in upper stretch and flattened. BIRDIE BE GONE was lightly bumped by COWGIRL KIMMIE in the opening strides,
chased the leading trio, bid three wide on the turn, was driven between horses in upper stretch, got forced out by OWEN'S PLEASURE as he drifted out
while splitting horses, and came up empty.

furlong marker and went clear under firm handling. GHAALEB THE GREAT tracked off the first flight outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn,
shifted out three wide racing through upper stretch and narrowly prevailed for the place honors late. CAT ATTACK sprinted to the lead from the outset while
angling to the inside, dueled for command into upper stretch but weakened late when failing to match the winner. I LUV THIS BAR tracked just off the first
flight along the inside racing to the turn, tipped off the rail racing through upper stretch and was just outkicked for a share between foes nearing the wire.
WHITE LIES was away a bit slowly when her head was turned at the start, settled outside foes racing well off the second flight to the turn and never gained
contention. PALAGO settled between foes in the last flight racing to the turn and never gained striking distance. MY MORNING GAL, off slowly, angled to
the rail in early stages tracking behind the second flight but lacked the needed closing response.

Footnotes
LONG TALL WOMAN tracked the leader inside early, tracked the leading pair in the two to three path on the turn, angled inside of BERAVINA in upper
stretch, led near the three sixteenths, drove clear midstretch and ran on safe to the wire. KEEPMEINTHE MOMENT tracked the pace three wide early, bid
outside of BERAVINA into the turn and engaged her in earnest near the three sixteenths, vied into upper stretch, was no match for LONG TALL WOMAN to
the inside from midstretch, but outfinished BERAVINA in the final sixteenth to secure the place. BERAVINA was sent for pace between horses and soon led,
was engaged by KEEPMEINTHE MOMENT to her outside approaching the three eighths, vied with that foe, was engaged by LONG TALL WOMAN to her
inside in upper stretch, was headed by that foe near the three sixteenths, vied between to midstretch but proved no match for the winner from there, and
was outfinished in the final sixteenth for the place. MAUREENLOVESFRANK chased outside toward the rear early, raced four wide on the turn, began to
improve near the five sixteenths, swung seven wide under a drive into the lane, and gained belatedly. MAYSTART broke inward and bumped MORGS
WORLD in the opening strides, raced near the rear outside of ALQWANI early, raced between horses on the turn, rallied three wide into the lane, gave
chase through midstretch but flattened out late. MARYS LAST SONG was fractious in the gate, chased behind the tracking flight down the back straight,
was urged midfield four wide on the turn and offered a mild bid, swung six wide into the lane and could not sustain a rally down the stretch. JOURNEYIST
tracked between horses early, chased the leading trio three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and flattened. WAR MUSIC raced at the rear
early, continued toward the rear in the five to six path on the turn, was driven four wide into the lane, angled inward in upper stretch and passed tiring
horses. SUMMER BELLE was a bit keen early while chasing behind the tracking flight, chased five wide on the turn, floated eight wide into the lane and had
no rally. ALQWANI broke outward into MORGS WORLD, chased toward the rear inside early, hugged the rail toward the rear of the main group on the turn,
was driven inside into the stretch and came up empty. MORGS WORLD was bumped between horses in the opening strides, chased between horses in the
opening furlong, weakened back to the rear and was outpaced while racing in the four path on the turn and had no rally in the lane.

Footnotes
FIRST KITTEN joined the pace three wide racing through the backstretch, forged clear racing into the turn while shifting to the inside, held a commanding
advantage racing into the stretch and was kept to some right handed pressure. LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT tracked off the second flight between foes under light
rating on the backstretch, shifted out splitting rivals three deep racing through the turn and continued with a steady effort to prove best of the others while
never threatening the winner. BELLS OF JOY, urged between rivals pressing the pace through the backstretch, couldn't match the winner entering the turn
and continued evenly between foes to late stages. QUEEN EKATI tracked off the second flight outside rivals racing to the turn, shifted four wide in upper
stretch and continued with interest to gain some position between foes in late stages. TAP N TWINE broke sharply, was urged inside rivals disputing the
pace on the backstretch, proved no match for the winner entering the turn and gave way into upper stretch. BOOZIN AT BOZOS tracked off the first flight
along the inside on the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid. WICKED GOOD tracked off the first flight between foes racing
into the turn and faded into upper stretch. HARD LIKE HOLLY, bumped soundly at the start, dropped well off the leaders and never menaced thereafter.
NOT TO BE DENIED settled inside foes in early stages and never proved a serious threat. UNION PARK GAL (IRE) tracked off the first flight in the four
path racing into the turn and gave way after a half. GOSHEN GIRL stumbled badly at the start while bumping HARD LIKE HOLLY and dropped out early.
