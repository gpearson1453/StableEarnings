no match for the winner while well clear for second. FAT DADDY with the second flight two wide, went evenly. YOUVESAIDITALL failed to menace. SHELL

three wide into the turn, made the lead, set the pace inside the winner until deep stretch and finished well clear for second. SOLDAT TEMPTATION

SHE'S CRAFTY trailed into the stretch, swung wide, circled her field while closing with a rush and was along in time. WINDY LU WHO pressed the pace
near the inside into the far turn, made the lead, battled the balance of the trip and finished a game second. AUNT BEE never far back, rallied along the rail
into the stretch, gained a narrow lead late then was outfinished. ROLLIN ALL THE WAY away alertly, set a pressured pace two wide into the far turn, dug in
determinedly when headed, matched strides until deep stretch and was outfinished. MOBIL LADY with the second flight three wide, faded in the stretch.
TOTALLY OBSESSED offered a mild bid four wide before a half then came up empty. CALI DREAM stalked the pace three wide into the far turn then gave
way.

DR. ZARNETT inside early, angled out four wide entering the turn, rallied under left then right handed urging and got up in the final strides.
REINVESTEDINTEREST chased the early pace three wide, made the lead in upper stretch, set the balance of the pace then couldn't handle the late charge
of the winner. KONTAR never far back, finished with good courage three wide. KID RUSSELL broke in front, set the pace into the stretch then weakened
late. BUCKEYE RUCKUS chased the pace along the inside into the stretch, faded late and returned bleeding from the nostrils. ONE CRAZY RIDE failed to
menace. THE MAN CAN was hustled from the gate to chased the pace two wide and was through after half. NAMBITI was no threat.

Footnotes
SCOOBY DREW close up near the inside, angled out passing the half mile marker causing KISSINGER to clip heels, surged three then two wide through
the turn, was carried out to the seven path entering the stretch, made the lead before the furlong marker then finished full of run to win as much the best
while in hand. KISSINGER clipped heels with the winner passing the half mile marker, rallied along the rail into the stretch, drew of even terms for the lead
then was no match while clear for second. MASTEROFTHEHOUNDS was hustled from the gate to set a pressured pace for a half, drifted out to the six path
then weakened late. WORTHY OPPONENT moved up three wide into the turn, was carried out to the middle of the racetrack entering the stretch then
weakened in the final furlong. BLUE MONARCH was no threat. MONSTER HUNTER was no factor. STREAKY pressed the early pace along the inside and
was through after a half. THE RIDER OF KISSINGER LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF SCOOBY DREW FOR INTERFERENCE
ON THE BACKSTRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED THE WINNER AND PLACED HIM SECOND.

Footnotes
BODE'S ROSE pressed the pace two wide for a quarter, assumed command, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch to win as much
the best while being ridden out. LADY ABRIL never far back, rallied in the four path into the stretch and finished clear for second. MARGARITA CINCO
drifted in at the start bumping rivals, steadied at the half mile marker then finished with good courage in the five path. LACY QUEEN allowed to settle,
improved position on the turn then failed to sustain that bid. LADY FORTUNE was bumped at the start and failed to menace. BIRDIE'S CHANTZ trailed into
the stretch, swung wide and passed tiring rivals. YOU NAME IT had good early speed then faded. COSTUME JEWELRY was no factor. SORORITY
SISTER was bumped start then no threat. SIREN CALL was bumped at the start and no factor. SPUN PRETTY set the early pace then stopped.
