Footnotes
PURCHASE POINT never far back, closed willingly in the five path through the stretch, made the lead past the sixteenth pole under right handed urging and
drew off. SABELLE pressed the pace three then two wide, made the lead entering the turn, shook clear quickly, set the pace until deep stretch then couldn't
handle the winner. MOANA'S TALE allowed to settle, had a mild rally late in the seven path. FIVE ROSES LUNA unhurried early, advanced along the rail
into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. VALIANT SPARK failed to menace. HALF LEGEND was no threat. AWESOME WONDER sped to the lead
soon after the start, set the pace for five sixteenths of a mile near the inside, had speed into the stretch then wilted. CANELITA had brief speed inside rivals.

Footnotes
YOUVESAIDITALL unhurried early, closed willingly five wide through the stretch under right handed urging and was along in time. ACTSPECTATION never
far back, loomed boldly on the far turn, dug in determinedly late and got up for second. CUMBER chased the pace three wide into the stretch, shifted
outside giving up ground then came on again late six wide. PROFESSIONAL chased the pace four wide for five furlongs, gained a narrow lead, battled the
balance of the trip and was outfinished in a game effort. COSMIC TREASURE chased the pace two wide into the far turn, drew on even terms foe the lead,
matched strides until deep stretch then weakened only slightly. ARTEMUS EAGLE unhurried early, finished with good courage two wide. GIZMO JONES
was no factor. ROCK ON KITTEN close up early along the inside, was through after half. SMASH sped to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace
for five furlongs then was used up.

Footnotes
COWCHI stalked the pace into the far turn, inched closer three wide, drifted out entering the stretch giving up some ground, surged late under a strong hand
ride three wide and was along in time. WHERETHERE'SSMOKE pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, inherited the lead late then couldn't handle the
winner. BEAUTIFUL LASS drifted out at the start, trailed for a half, closed rapidly into the stretch, split horses two wide making the lead at the furlong
marker then was outfinished. FAITHFUL SOLUTION close up from the start, offered a mild bid four wide into the stretch, drifted out and leveled off. LATE
DATE unhurried early, loomed boldly three four wide into the stretch then came up empty. SENORA PANQUEQUES sped to the lead four wide on the first
turn, dropped inside, set the pace into the stretch then weakened. CRIMSON LEGION was always outrun, stopped in the stretch and was eased to the wire.
WAFFLESORPANCAKES checked inside along the inside in the first turn, had brief speed, stopped on the far turn and was eased to the wire.
