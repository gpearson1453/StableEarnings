Footnotes
PRINCESS PALMER saved ground while racing in hand, angled out nearing the stretch to be three-wide and finished strongly to be up in the final sixteenth.
MASHUA stalked the pace while racing between horses on the turn, responded to pressure and finished strongly. POLICE WOMAN was bumped at the
start, then was sent to set the pace into the stretch and held on well during the drive. HOLY DELITE chased the pace from along the outside but lacked a
rally when called upon. MIDNIGHT CHOIR was reserved off the early pace while racing five-wide, loomed up to offer a mild bid entering the stretch and then
flattened out. MADE MY WISH bobbled at the start, then moved up to chase the pace to the stretch and faded. BIZZY BIZZY was bumped at the start, then
raced in the middle of the pack and failed to seriously threaten. LOOKIN SPUNKY was bumped at the start, then moved up to be forwardly placed early and
faded. MADE IT hopped in the air at the start, then saved ground and was not a factor.

MONYINTHEBANKSEY saved ground setting the pace in hand and drew off to win with something left. ALBERTANO stalked the pace while racing along
the inside, angled out to be three-wide on the turn to offer a bid, could not reach the winner but finished well for the place in a good effort. GIOCARE
prompted the pace for a half mile, continued on well to the stretch and weakened slightly. DR. FERBER steadied from between horses while in tight entering
the first turn, then was allowed to settle in stride, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. TOE CURLIN' KISS dropped back early, raced removed
from the inside rail and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ANGEL ART prompted the pace set by Expectations Met while racing two-wide, caught that one to gain the lead nearing the eighth pole, drifted in late and
held a safe advantage. HOW SWEET SHE IS was reserved off the early pace, moved up three-wide on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and finished
fast. EXPECTATIONS MET set ground setting the pace, responded when challenged, altered course to the outside late when the winner came in and
finished willingly. LEVISA brushed at the start with Creole, then raced in the middle of the pack and gained her best stride too late. FIVECOMMATWO was
allowed to settle in stride while saving ground, got shuffled back on the turn. slipped through to offer a bid entering the stretch and then went evenly late. LA
TRAVIESA was prominent to the stretch while racing three-wide and faded. CREOLE was brushed at the start, then lacked early speed and failed to
threaten. BEE MOUNTAIN stumbled at the break, was close up to the stretch while racing between horses and faded. GOLDEN EMMA was brushed at the
start, then dropped far back and was not a factor. THE JOCKEY OF EXPECTATIONS MET LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER, BUT
AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS, THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

HOT LOOKIN ROYAL was allowed to settle in stride, rallied three-wide on the turn, took command entering the stretch and drew off to win under a solid
hand ride. BELLA BETTINA was unhurried early, rallied five-wide the final quarter, could not reach the winner but finished well for the place.
REDWHITEANDTACOS was never far back while saved ground, angled out entering the stretch and finished in a mild rally. LADY WHISTLEDOWN was
forwardly place while racing along the outside but lacked the needed late response. KOBE'S GIRL dropped back early while saving ground, angled out
during the drive and passed tiring rivals. EXTRA CRUNCHY saved ground setting the pace to the stretch and faded during the drive. BOSS ANGEL raced in
the middle of the pack and lacked a rally. BLAME THE IRISH dropped back early and failed to threaten. MI YAYIS gave way after showing brief speed.
RAISE YOUR GAME stumbled badly at the start unseating the rider and was walked off following the race. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
INTO THE START, BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
FULL COUNT FELICIA settled in stride while racing along the outside, made a bold bid while four-wide nearing the quarter pole, took the lead entering the
stretch, quickly drew clear and was ridden out to increase her advantage. LISHEEN was unhurried early, rallied four-wide into the stretch and finished
strongly. COLOR CRUSH dropped back early, came five-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. THISNAMEISOKAY quickly opened a clear lead,
saved ground setting the pace to the stretch and weakened. GALILEI dropped back early to saved ground, angled out nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
stumbled when clipping heels soon after, angled out and gained some ground late. GIRL'S ON FIRE saved ground while racing in the middle of the pack but
lacked a rally when asked. CHORUS GIRL was forwardly placed while racing two-wide to near the stretch and tired. ANILEATE , four wide outside foes
early on, was prominently placed while racing three-wide to near the stretch and faded. WITTY BANTER was shuffled back early and failed to threaten.
AMPLIO ESQUEMA raced 4-deep and failed to menace. AMAZON QUEEN raced in the middle of the pack, steadied nearing the five-sixteenths pole form
between horses and gave way. GLOWSITY prompted the pace for six furlongs and gave way.

was ridden out to increase his advantage. VALENZAN DAY saved ground while being forwardly placed, steadied briefly lacking room nearing the quarter
pole, angled out to split rivals entering the stretch and finished strongly. R B'S THE BOSS broke out, then was allowed to settle in stride, came five-wide into
the stretch and finished in a mild rally. SWIFTY DEVIL dropped back early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole and then went evenly
late. BO'S BOURBON saved ground setting the pace to the stretch and weakened during the drive. LORD UHTRED gave way after showing early speed
while four-wide. SILVER PHANTOM dropped back early and failed to threaten. EVENLY DIVIDED was pinched back shortly after the start and was not a

COCKTAIL DREAMING saved ground stalking the pace, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished strongly to be up in the final strides.
MUSICMANSANDY saved ground setting the pressured pace, responded to open a clear lead nearing the eighth pole and just failed to last in a game effort.
BAYLIS STREET disputed the early pace from along the inside, dropped back slightly on the turn and then continued on well for the show in a good effort.
LUCIDITY was allowed to settle in stride, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ONE LAS OLAS dropped back early, was four-wide
entering te stretch and failed to factor. SECRET ANGEL was forwardly placed for three furlongs and tired.
