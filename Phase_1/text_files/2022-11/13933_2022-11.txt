Footnotes
BUSINESS MODEL laid off of the pace two wide, moved forward between horses down the backstretch, tipped outside of the leading trio in upper stretch,
rallied with a clear B DAWK to catch in the final sixteenth, and reeled that foe in at the wire via a head-bob to dead-heat. B DAWK pressed two wide and
between horses, vied down the backstretch, sparred around the far turn, forged a very narrow margin in upper stretch, clung to that advantage while
hanging on his left lead through midstretch, changed leads entering the final sixteenth, inched clear shortly after, but met BUSINESS MODEL's bid
approaching the wire, and got caught via a head-bob to dead-heat. OPEN ROAD perched himself outside of the top pair, pressed before bidding turning for
home, vied entering the lane, but yielded briefly in upper stretch, then sustained his chase to reach show while getting outkicked by an outer foe in the final
sixteenth. DROPPIN G'S set the pace inside of a pair of pressers, sparred with them around the far turn, but was headed entering the lane, and gave way.
ETHEREAL ROAD settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted out to the five path around the far turn, but hung on his left lead through the lane and
failed to menace. JUNGLE WARFARE tracked while achieving inside position around the first turn, but faded turning for home. SEARCH ENGINE tracked
four wide, but gave way nearing the lane. DOUBLE THUNDER was outrun.

Footnotes
BLACK FOREST disputed the pace off of the inside, shook clear entering the stretch, was kept to task and maintained a safe advantage. KLASSY
BRIDGETTE attended the pace inside, shifted out leaving the turn, came three wide, kicked on well but was unable to reach the winner. MAGICAL SONG
was unhurried into stride, save ground, angled out entering the stretch, finished well once uncovered and was making up ground. AFFIRMATIVE LADY was
allowed to settle, circled into the stretch five wide and improved position. NO GUILT was unhurried, looped five wide and finished with a mild gain.
STRIKINGLY SPUN settled off of the inside, rallied between rivals but failed to threaten. ADIVA stalked three deep, offered a mild bid but failed to sustain
the drive. LA PERLA NERA failed to make headway. VIVID DREAMS contended between horses for a half and faded. STAY FABULOUS contested the
pace inside to the stretch and tired. INDY AGAIN bobbled at the start, settled saving ground, but lacked a response when called upon. LOVIN' ON THE
RUN was forwardly placed between horses through the turn and dropped out.

Footnotes
MARSALIS stalked the pace early on three wide, stayed three wide along the turn, was in the four path into the lane, took over command at the top of the
lane, was under a long drive down the lane and inched clear of foes in the final stages. CALL ME FAST was steadied along the inside down the backstretch,
raced in the three path entering the lane, split horses in the stretch while making a bid, continued the bid under a long drive but did not have enough in the
final stages and held off rival for place. SEAL BEACH chased the pace early, raced in the four path along the turn, was in the five path entering the lane,
rallied down the lane while four wide late and gaining but missed place in the final stages. PAGE ONE pressed the pace early from between horses, was in
the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch under a long drive but weakened late in the drive. PRO OXIDANT bobbled and was bumped at the
start, raced three wide along he turn, was in the six path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch run. SPARTAN ARMY chased the pace early, was in
the four path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. PAPA ROCKET raced back early on, swung into the six path into the lane and lacked a
rally in the stretch. UNCAPTURED SKY vied for the lead early from the inside, raced in the two path into the lane and faded down the lane. MAC'S TIME
was done early. APPEAL DENIED was checked hard nearing the seven sixteenths pole and soon folded up. LET MY PEOPLE GO reared at the start and
lost the rider.

Footnotes
GIANT MISCHIEF stalked along the inside, slipped inside of the leader to bid at the five sixteenths pole as an outer ARABIAN LION loomed as well, inched
an advantage from that foe entering the lane while kicking well clear of the rest, then tenaciously clung to his margin through midstretch, and inched away
late. ARABIAN LION bobbled shortly after the start, recovered quickly, stalked outside of the clear leader and from the three path into the turn, ranged up to
bid at the five sixteenths pole as an inner rival slipped along the rail to challenge the fore, then dueled with that foe through the lane but failed to sustain the
battle entering the final sixteenth, and toiled late once bested. OLD ALLIANCE laid off of the pace four wide, moved up to claim show at the furlong grounds
while in another zip code from the leading pair, and lasted from an outer rival late. WELAKA broke step slowly while brushing the outer part of the gate,
lagged behind around the turn, swung five wide entering the lane, and rallied outside of foes in the final furlong, but missed reaching show. PROTEGE
tracked four wide, chased from the three path around the turn, but failed to keep pace while tucking to the two path entering the lane, and tired. TRES
SOLES chased three wide and between horses while in midstretch, but failed to sustain that position at the half mile pole, and gave way. HUNTERTOWN
lacked speed along the inside, shifted three wide turning for home, and made little impact. JIN TONG tracked two wide, but faded along the inside while
hanging on his left lead through the lane. TAP IN FORMATION set a clear pace in the two path as the eventual one-two finishers gave chase into the turn,
but was swallowed up between those bidders at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened while hanging on his left lead. BAYTOWN LOVELY rushed the gate
briefly while awaiting the a start, settled off of the pace along the inside, tucked to the rail at the half mile pole, but faded.

NEXT opened clear to dictate terms, rebuffed all challengers leaving the turn and widened. HEYWOODS BEACH attended the pace along the inside, failed
to menace the winner but continued on willingly for the runner up spot. BAL HARBOUR tracked to the outside of NEXT in hand, loomed a danger into the
final furlong, but wilted in the drive and settled for the minor award. RATTLE N ROLL was allowed to settle, moved up three wide to make a mild bid on the
final turn, but failed to sustain the drive. WIN THE DAY settled in hand, saved ground to the backstretch, altered to the outside after a mile, made a mild
advance but failed to threaten. ALWAYS ABOVE tucked in to save ground, closed the gap along the inside down the backstretch, but weakened entering
the lane and faded. SHERIFF BROWN was hard to settle between horses, leveled into stride after a half but failed to make headway. KAZAN (IRE) passed
only the tiring ones. CLAYTNTHELIONHEART was close up three wide, was fanned out further after a mile, came up empty on the final turn and dropped
out. CUPID'S CLAWS contended, came up empty on the final turn and dropped out.

Footnotes
MISCHIEF MAGIC (IRE) was a bit slow at the start and trailed the field early on from the inside, tipped out into the two path entering the lane, rallied down
the lane while angling for room throughout, finally found an opening and drove past the leader while clearing the field in the final stages. DRAMATISED
(IRE) was reserved early along the inside, stayed on the rail into the lane, snuck through and took over near the eighth pole, inched clear nearing the
sixteenth pole but yielded and held place in the final stages. PRIVATE CREED raced back early on, was steadied nearing the quarter pole, darted out into
the six path entering the lane, wandered in the upper stretch, rallied down the lane but was outkicked by the winner and did not have enough for place in the
final stages. PERSIAN FORCE (IRE) chased the pace early, raced in the six path along the turn, was in the five path entering the lane, made a four wide bid
in the stretch but weakened late in the drive. LADY HOLLYWOOD (GB) was a bit slow at the start, chased the early pace, raced in the three path entering
the lane, made a three wide bid near the three sixteenths pole but hung late. AMERICAN APPLE stalked the pace early from the inside, took over and led
nearing the lane, was in the two path into the lane and gave way down the lane. SHARP AZA TACK was bumped around at the start, raced in the three path
into the lane. LOVE REIGNS (IRE) fanned into the eight path entering the lane while never a threat. SPEED BOAT BEACH pressed the pace early two
wide, was bumped near the five sixteenths pole, raced in the four path entering the lane and was empty the rest of the way. OXYMORE raced in the five
path along the turn, fanned into the nine path entering the lane while done early. THE PLATINUM QUEEN (IRE) fought restraint early on, raced in the five
path along the turn, was in the seven path into the lane and tired down the lane. TYLER'S TRIBE had early speed, stopped along the turn, was eased in the
stretch, vanned off after the race, and was found to have bled.

Footnotes
WONDER WHEEL failed to gain early position despite moderate rider urging, settled far back three wide, tucked to the rail approaching the far turn,
patiently awaited racing room entering that bend, eye-catchingly rallied along the rail while slipping inside of foes around the far turn, sustained improvement
to come into the lane just behind the top pair, tipped outside of them coming to the furlong grounds, bid leaving that marker, and drove clear. LEAVE NO
TRACE pressed two wide, bid around the far turn, led entering the lane, but was collared by an outer rival inside the final furlong, failed to kick on with her at
the sixteenth pole, and held place. RAGING SEA was last away, moved forward before tucking two wide and between horses whilst midpack around the first
turn, but failed to sustain that position nearing the far turn, held up behind traffic before tucking to the fence at the quarter pole, rallied inside of foes entering
the lane, then stayed on two wide in the final furlong. SABRA TUFF took brushes from rivals on both sides at the start, then took up from tight quarters
between horses early on, trailed, swung to the six path turning for home, and rallied outside of rivals. YOU'RE MY GIRL bumped with an inner foe at the
start, stalked along the inside, chased in the two path around the far turn, got outkicked by inner foes entering the lane, then shied between horses in upper
stretch before sustaining her chase. GRAND LOVE set the pace inside of a pressing rival, got headed entering the lane, and gave way. ATOMICALLY
tracked two wide and between horses, but was outmoved by an inner foe while tipping three wide entering the lane, and weakened on her left lead. AND
TELL ME NOLIES shifted out to the five path entering the backstretch while off of the pace, then took the far turn four to five wide and failed to menace.
ALMA ROSA tracked along the inside, chased from between horses around the far turn, then lacked a rally among foes. VEGAS MAGIC bumped an outer
rival at the start, raced far back before checking off rival's heels entering the backstretch, then trailed in the six to three path around the far turn, tucked
entering the lane, and moved up. SHOPLIFTER bumped with an inner rival at the start, raced in midpack in the four path, then from between horses around
the far turn, and gave way. CHOCOLATE GELATO bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked three wide, but weakened while floated four wide and
between horses entering the lane. CHOP CHOP tugged while far back in the four to six path around the first turn, then was caught five wide around the far
turn before fading turning for home.

Footnotes
MEDITATE (IRE) settled in hand, ranged into striking position through the second turn five wide, was set down once straightened, engulfed the leaders
nearing the furlong marker and drew clear. PLEASANT PASSAGE settled between rivals, came four wide, angled out further entering the stretch, quickened
once uncovered and was closing rapidly. CAIRO CONSORT was forwardly placed along the inside, got through entering the stretch, shifted out nearing the
furlong marker, bumped FREE LOOK and forced that one out, kept on fairly well but settled for the minor award. MIDNIGHT MILE (IRE) was unhurried,
came three wide, angled out further and was making up ground. FREE LOOK stalked the pace, bid between horses entering the stretch, was bumped and
steadied when CAIRO CONSORT came out near the furlong marker and flattened thereafter. LAST CALL broke a step slow, settled saving ground, got
through to make a mild bid, but failed to sustain the drive. COMANCHE COUNTRY (IRE) was allowed to settle, made a mild rally between horses but failed
to seriously threaten. MANHATTAN JUNGLE (IRE) tracked three wide, drew even leaving the second turn, but faltered between runners in the drive. BE
YOUR BEST (IRE) settled between, moved up into the stretch, was blocked and checked nearing the furlong marker and faltered. DELIGHT was close up in
hand, loomed a danger four wide, but came up empty entering the stretch and faded. BASIL MARTINI (IRE) failed to respond. BLING contended five wide
through the second turn and tired. SPIRIT GAL (FR) opened clear to set the pace, was headed leaving the second turn and gave way readily. XIGERA
brushed the gate, went wide and was never a factor.

Footnotes
FORTE came out at the start, chased the pace early on, moved out to the four path near the five sixteenths pole, was in the six path entering the lane,
rallied down the lane, edged past the leader near the sixteenth pole and cleared the field in the final stages. CAVE ROCK broke in at the start, vied along
the first turn from the three path, took over command down the backstretch, raced in the two to three path along the far turn, cleared the field entering the
lane, remained clear nearing the eighth pole, was lugging in a bit then overtaken and no match for the winner in the late stages. NATIONAL TREASURE
chased the pace early, raced in the three path along the far turn, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid at the top of the lane but flattened out late in
the drive. BLAZING SEVENS was bumped and bothered at the start, raced back early on, darted into the seven path entering the lane, made a bid in the
stretch but leveled off late in the drive. CURLY JACK tracked the pace early on, raced in the four path along the far turn, stayed in the four path entering the
lane and was empty down the lane. VERIFYING was bumped and bothered at the start, raced in the five path along the far turn, was in the six path into the
lane and lacked a bid down the lane. HURRICANE J stalked the pace early along the inside, stayed near the rail into the lane and gave way in the stretch
drive. CONGRUENT was bumped at the start, steadied along the first turn and was never a factor. WOUND UP was done early. LOST ARK was never
involved, eased in the stretch and walked off after the race.

Footnotes
VICTORIA ROAD (IRE) tracked along the inside, saved ground while patiently awaiting racing room around the far turn, threaded the needle and split foes
three wide in upper stretch, bid along with an inner SILVER KNOTT (GB) at the furlong grounds, chased that foe while dueling through the late stages, and
reeled him in at the wire. SILVER KNOTT (GB) broke slowly, saved ground off of the pace, committed to a rail charge in upper stretch, slipped through tight
quarters along the fence in midstretch to bid at the furlong grounds, led shortly after as an outer VICTORIA ROAD (IRE) battled on, and got caught in the
shadow of the wire. NAGIRROC tracked two wide and between horses, tipped four wide in upper stretch, got outkicked by a pair of inner bidders while
floating five wide in midstretch, and stayed on to secure show. MO STASH stalked two wide, bid entering the lane, led through upper stretch, but was
outkicked by rivals on both sides approaching the final sixteenth, and faltered late. BATTLE OF NORMANDY settled off of the pace two wide and between
horses, shifted five wide in upper stretch, checked when NAGIRROC floated across her path at the furlong grounds, then chased evenly among rivals.
GASLIGHT DANCER tracked three to four wide, but yielded in the seven path in upper stretch, then kept on between horses. ANDTHEWINNERIS saved
ground at the rear, then rallied in the four path and between horses in the final furlong. PACKS A WAHLOP stalked along the inside, pursued the leader
from between horses in upper stretch, but yielded through the final furlong. MAJOR DUDE tracked three wide, but yielded while floated five wide leaving the
quarter pole, and kept on between horses. I'M VERY BUSY settled three wide, swung six wide entering the lane, but lacked a rally after being floated eight
wide in upper stretch. WEBSLINGER leaned a bit outwardly at the start, rated at the rear two to three wide, came into the lane six wide, and failed to factor.
REALLY GOOD failed to make an impact, then chased behind traffic through the late stages. RECKONING FORCE laid unhurried four wide, but was
wrangled back between horses to rail the field at the five furlong pole and made little impart thereafter. CURLY LARRY AND MO set a clear pace, but was
headed leaving the quarter pole, and got swallowed up between horses at the furlong grounds.
