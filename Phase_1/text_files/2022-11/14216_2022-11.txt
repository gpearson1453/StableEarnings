Footnotes
IOYA AGAIN exchanged bumps, then was held up out of tight quarters start to race last to the backstretch, switched outside foes gathering momentum
nearing upper stretch, split foes five wide in the lane, then rallied stoutly through the stretch shifting inwards under pressure to prevail in time under firm
encouragemen. GRAND HIDEAWAY, forwardly placed stalking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, made a steady advance on that rival to gain the
advantage midstretch but couldn't fend off the winner. RONNI'S STORM broke sharply, set the pace along the inside to the backstretch, dueled for
command into the lane while tipping off the inside and contested the issue grudgingly to late stages while failing to contain the top pair. PERFECT WAGER
angled to the inside tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, steadily gained position along the rail to challenge inside the leaders in upper stretch
but lacked the needed final kick. REMEMBER THE MAINE, reserved just off the inside to the backstretch, shifted out entering the lane to split rivals three
wide, then shifted out six wide in the last furlong while making some mild progress. CAMMACK tracked off the second flight three deep, then between foes
in the opening stages, was prompted to advance between rivals nearing upper stretch, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed
final response. KRAMDEN angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight in the opening half, dropped back racing into the far turn,
then continued along the rail to late stages while producing a second effort to regain some position. HANNITY, exchanged bumps at the start, settled
between foes to the backstretch, shifted out to race three wide between foes into the far turn but offered no rally. RIVER FINN, pulling a bit against restraint
inside foes, switched outside rivals nearing the backstretch, was prompted to gain some position four wide racing through the far turn but flattened out
entering the lane. DELFT BLUE settled outside foes in the last flight early, was prompted to advance four wide into the far turn, was fanned to the six path in
upper stretch and had no late response. DRAMATIC KITTEN was rated off the second flight along the inside in the opening stages but retreated early.

Footnotes
DESSERT FIRST chased three wide around the first turn, continued midfield outside horses down the back straight, made a three wide bid on the far turn,
engaged outside the leading flight past the three eighths, was driven in upper stretch and vied with LORRAINE'S LEGACY, led for good near the sixteenth
pole, was bumped by LORRAINE'S LEGACY but seemed unfazed and edged away late. LORRAINE'S LEGACY tracked two wide around the first turn,
tracked the leader down the back straight, bid into the far turn and engaged outside the leader two wide approaching the three eighths, led between horses
into the lane, vied inside of DESSERT FIRST under a drive, drifted out in the final furlong, could not hold DESSERT FIRST at bay in the final sixteenth,
lugged out, bumped that foe, and chased on second best. TAVERN hesitated at the break and hopped while leaving the gate, settled at the rear, bid in the
five path on the far turn, came into the lane in the six to seven path, and chased on mildly to prove best of the rest. J Z'S FINE WINE tracked the pace inside
around the first turn, chased behind LORRAINE'S LEGACY into the backstretch, joined the tracking flight inside of that foe near the nine sixteenths, chased
along the rail around the far turn, lacked the kick to engage the leaders in the lane, and bumped CANDY LOOKER while lugging out late. CANDY LOOKER
was keen to the lead, set the pace while clear through the first turn and down the back straight, was joined by LORRAINE'S LEGACY to her outside near
the three eighths, vied inside to the quarter, proved no match for LORRAINE'S LEGACY and DESSERT FIRST when driven in upper stretch, weakened,
and was bumped late by J Z'S FINE WINE. VOSTRA was restrained while chasing behind the tracking flight around the first turn, pulled between horses
down the backstretch, joined the tracking flight three wide near the nine sixteenths, was pushed along but found herself outpaced in the four to five path
from near the nine sixteenths, swung out near the center of the track in upper stretch but lacked a response under a drive.

Footnotes
NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE) broke sharply, sprinted clear inside of his rivals along the inside to dictate the pace into the bend, held sway on a widening
advantage past midstretch and held the late challenge of RACE DRIVER under firm encouragement. The latter angled to the inside tracking off the second
flight racing to the turn, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch, then shifted inwards under pressure while continuing willingly to close the gap to the
end. MALPAIS, reserved inside foes in the opening stages, shifted off the inside nearing upper stretch, angled five wide entering the lane, was prompted to
advance while hopping a shadow midstretch but continued with interest to edge a rival for a share. IAN GLASS, carried inwards by ADIOS ASHER while
caught in close quarters in the opening furlong, shifted out three wide racing into the bend while being prompted to advance, moved to striking position in
that path entering the lane but quickly flattened out. ADIOS ASHER angled in sharply in the opening stages crossing the path of IAN GLASS while being
urged to a position pursuing the pacesetter between foes into the turn, gave way nearing midstretch. LAND MARK DEAL settled between foes in the last
flight on the backstretch, was fanned six wide entering the lane but lacked a rally. STAR OF KODIAK, slow to gather stride, never gained contention. W W
HOTSHOT was urged inside foes through close quarters pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, then gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
MUD ISLAND was nudged to the lead, raced a bit headstrong while well clear along the inside around the turn, carried a clear lead into the lane, went to a
drive midstretch and kept finding enough to hold sway. JOHNNY UP broke out and bumped DASTARDLY DEEDS in the opening strides, was then bumped
by C F V RED NOVA, tracked the pace between horses, was pushed along while still tracking between horses on the turn, proved no match for MUD
ISLAND in upper stretch, but chased on with continued interest, gradually lessened the gap late but could not reel him in. C F V RED NOVA broke out and
bumped JOHNNY UP in the opening strides, tracked the leader along the inside down the back straight, continued to track well behind the leader while
saving ground on the turn, altered outside of JOHNNY UP in upper stretch and chased on willingly for show. TRIPLE CHROME broke inward and bumped
DASTARDLY DEEDS in the opening strides, chased three wide down the backstretch, was pushed along on the turn while still three wide, drifted out under
a drive in upper stretch and flattened. DASTARDLY DEEDS was pinballed between horses in the opening strides and soon trailed, trailed in the two to three
path on the turn, swung six wide into the lane and offered no rally.

Footnotes
QUILTING PARTY, caught in close quarters at the start, was held up last racing to the first turn while angling to the inside, commenced a steady advance
along the rail racing into the far turn, came through inside the leaders when presented an opening nearing upper stretch and wrested a clear advantage in
time under firm handling. MAKEMEBELIEVE, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, moved to press the issue between foes
racing into the far turn, dueled into upper stretch but failed to contain the winner while prevailing for the place honors. VERKLIMT was rated just off the
leaders while switching outside those rivals racing into the first turn, advanced three deep nearing the far turn to press the pace in that path to upper stretch
but was outkicked by the top pair. WAR MUSIC ducked out at the start crossing into the path of MARIA'S GIFT, was urged along the inside setting the pace
on a clear margin to the backstretch, dueled inside foes into the far turn, tipped out racing into upper stretch and came up empty leaving the furlong marker.
MARIA'S GIFT, cut off, then steadied just after the start, settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to mount a serious challenge. LAKE
BARKLEY was rated along the inside racing to the first turn, shifted out four wide entering the backstretch and was through early.

Footnotes
TWO COOKIE RULE chased the leading pair inside of BETTER THINK TWICE on the clubhouse turn, took closer order on the leading pair from near the
eleven sixteenths, tracked the leader around the far turn while hugging the rail, swung into the lane in the four path, was under a hard drive in upper stretch,
continued to chase doggedly while being carried out as the leader drifted, nonetheless reeled him in near the sixteenth pole and edged clear. MY
BROTHER CAM led inside of BOURBON DELIGHT while a bit keen around the clubhouse turn, continued on a clear lead down the backstretch and in the
two path on the far turn, came into the lane in the three path, went to a drive past the three sixteenths on a dwindling lead, was engaged by TWO COOKIE
RULE midstretch, carried that foe out as he drifted, nonetheless lost the lead to that foe near the sixteenths and chased on second best. KNIEVEL soon
trailed while showing a somewhat awkward stride early, edged gradually closer down the backstretch, raced at the rear of a closer-knit pack in the three
path on the far turn, swung into the six path for the drive and chased on mildly to prove best of the rest. BETTER THINK TWICE chased the leading pair
outside of TWO COOKIE RULE, edged closer in tandem with that foe past the eleven sixteenths, was driven in the four path on the far turn and offered a
brief bid between horses, was no match for the top two in upper stretch and weakened. BOURBON DELIGHT was sent for pace, prompted outside of MY
BROTHER CAM around the first turn, stalked down the back straight, raced in the three path around the far turn while still in range until emptying out past
the five sixteenths, was driven in the three path in upper stretch, had no response and continued to fade.

Footnotes
BIG SPORT broke sharply, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin in hand to upper stretch, then came under some right handed pressure to maintain
the advantage. KIERKEGAARD tracked the pacesetter three deep between foes in second flight racing to the turn, then continued in that path with a steady
effort to prove best of the others. TIME HEIST, off slowly, settled outside foes in the last flight racing into the bend, was fanned six wide in upper stretch and
kept on well enough to prevail for a share. SOUPER FORTUNE tracked the leaders in the four path as part of the second flight racing into the bend, drifted
widest in late stages and had no closing bid. WILDWOOD SECRET tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight racing into the bend and faded into
upper stretch. LAVENDER EARL settled between foes in the last flight early and never gained striking distance. SHANGHAI POINT was urged to a forward
position just outside the pacesetter in the opening stages, shifted to the inside racing through the turn and gave out late.

Footnotes
APOLLO U ANYWHERE was sent for speed, set the pace while pressured by FOGGY KITTEN, dueled inside that foe from the three eighths to upper
stretch, wrested a narrow lead in upper stretch, and opened up while kept to task. KHOZYS CROWN chased outside of PRANCIPANTS early, chased in the
two path at the middle of a well-strung field around the turn, chased on while drifting out in the lane, found her best stride in the final sixteenth, got up for
place late and gained on the leader to the finish. FOGGY KITTEN pressed outside of APOLLO U ANYWHERE early, engaged that foe in a duel near the
three eighths, relinquished a narrow lead to APOLLO U ANYWHERE in upper stretch, could not keep pace with that foe into midstretch, and lost the place
late. PRANCIPANTS chased inside of KHOZYS CROWN down the back straight, raced toward the rear in the two to three path on the turn, swung four wide
into upper stretch, drifted out a few more paths but nonetheless rallied mildly. PRINCESS CONSUELA settled at the rear early, raced in the rear flight
between horses into the turn, was pushed along between foes and began to improve in the four path between horses past the three eighths, was driven six
wide into the lane and passed tiring horses. HEY HEY tracked the leading pair inside of BOBBIE TOO TOO early, tracked in the four path on the turn, came
four wide into the lane, drifted out a few paths and flattenedl. TWO MORE TIMES settled near the rear inside, saved ground at the inside of the rear trio
around the bend, came into upper stretch in the two path and lacked a rally. INDAWIN settled three wide near the rear early, continued in the five path with
the rear group around the bend, swung seven wide into the lane and lacked a bid. BOBBIE TOO TOO tracked the leading pair two wide down the back
straight, chased in the two to three path on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, drifted in and weakened.
