inside, bid into the backstretch, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. CAN'T FIGURE was very difficult to load then rated off the rail,
picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but showed little response. FORT ZANNA settled off the rail then eased out into the backstretch, picked
up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response. HERECOMESPUDD raced well back off the rail and was not a factor. JUJU ON

Footnotes
SUPER GARNER rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was met a the rail midway on the far turn but dug in
determinedly to inch clear of NICO in later yards, while the latter rated close inside and took aim at the three eighths pole, dueled to even terms two deep
midway on the far turn and dug in gamely to mid-stretch before relenting later yards. OUT OF CENTS raced well off the pace in the four path the first turn,
gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the four path of the far turn, dueled clear for third later yards and was gaining on the runner-up.
HERO'S MAN stalked off the rail, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened. BOASTER saved ground
racing well back and could only improve his position. COMMAND THE CAT settled close in the four path the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and weakened. NIGHT TRAIN WAYNE settled off the rail on the first turn and never factored.

Footnotes
PHILMARY CASTLE moved to the inside and rated pace from the five eighths pole, came under pressure at the three eighths, was met at the five
sixteenths, contested the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly to take the nod over the game effort of ALLI BOBBY, who ducked in leaving the gate
and rounded the first turn about the five path, left the turn outside and challenged at the three eighths pole, took a slim lead at the five sixteenths, was met
while two deep midway on the far turn, dug in gamely through the stretch but missed the nod under the wire. WOODSONG'S CASTLE exchanged contact
with Roo leaving the gate then rated close inside, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then dueled
through the stretch for third. VEGAS PRINCESS stalked two deep the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded at the rail on the far
turn. ROO exchanged contact with Woodsong's Castle and rounded the first turn in the three path, challenged at the three eighths pole but dropped back
past the five sixteenths and weakened in the four path of the far turn. A BLONDE THING saved early ground, picked up the chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and weakened in the lane. LAURA'S GRAND rounded the first turn four wide and stalked into the
backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened in the four path of the far turn. OUR ITSY BITSY rounded the first turn in the six path,
left the turn outside and was eased the final quarter.
