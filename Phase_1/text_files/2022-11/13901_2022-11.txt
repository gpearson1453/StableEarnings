Footnotes
EPIC QUEEN led the way on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held that
margin to the wire. SEEKINGARRANGEMENT pressed the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, dueled from the two and three path
around the turn, could not go with the winner in the lane and chased that rival home. QUEEN OF MINE chased the front runners on the outside in the early
going, navigated the turn from the two path and kept on in the stretch. NOTHINGMAKESENSE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the
backstretch, angled in to save ground while trailing the field around the bend and finished evenly. ROBS DREAM raced off the pace on the inside in the
opening stages, saved ground around the turn and faded in the stretch. KRONE trailed the field up the backstretch, offered a mild bid while racing in the two
path around the turn and flattened out in the lane.
