Footnotes
HOLY BERRIES tracked the pace two wide, took the lead nearing the eighth pole, dug in inside of RIA FORMOSA when that foe reached near even terms
near the sixteenth pole and inched ahead late. RIA FORMOSA was off a step slow, steadied soon after the start, saved ground off the pace around the first
turn, swung out early on the backstretch, advanced three wide around the far turn, reached near even terms outside of the winner near the sixteenth pole
but was denied. KAREN'S REVENGE stalked the pace inside around the first turn, bid two wide nearing the far turn, drew clear at the rail around that bend,
led to midstretch and kept on to saved the show. NURSE JUDY WHITNEY raced off the pace three and four wide and ran on for a minor share.
UNCAPTURED GRACE chased the pace two wide, checked near the five-sixteenths pole then had a mild stretch gain. STARE IF YOU MUST was bumped
entering the first turn, raced two wide around that bend, saved ground around the far turn and never threatened. FLAT OUT COOL was bumped entering
the first turn, saved ground in midpack, went two to three wide around the far turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch, bid inside of foes then flattened out
while continuing on the left lead. KATZ THAT GAL was sluggish at the start, raced well back inside early, was forced out early on the backstretch, went four
wide around the far turn and lacked a rally. BELLA MIURA was reluctant to load, was forced out entering the first turn, raced three wide around that bend,
was forced out again early on the backstretch, continued three wide around the far turn and made little impact. DIAMOND ROCK set the pace along the rail
and retreated around the far turn.

Footnotes
HOT BODE was unhurried from the four path early, loomed up from five wide rounding the far turn, drifted in while making a bid at the top of the lane, and
drew clear. WHAT KNOT rated in the four path, was ridden from the three path into the stretch, shifted back out in deep stretch, and rallied for place.
CALIFORNIA GIGI stalked from the three path, was coaxed from the six path into the stretch, and ran on to secure show. ELUSIVE UNCAPTURED pressed
in the three path, led going into the far turn, opened up into the lane, but tired in the final furlong. J'S STAR JET chased in the five path, floated out to the
seven path turning into the lane, but finished evenly. LA BRODY raced in midpack from the three path, was forced to take up in upper stretch from a drifting
outer foe, but was one paced through the lane. FIRST GOLD prompted the pace from inside but flattened down the lane. BE THE ONE trailed from three
path into the far turn, swung out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but was no factor. HOTTER THAN JULY set the pace from inside but yielded
turning into the lane. MONTANA JOYCE tracked from inside but was tired entering the far turn.

IL MIRACOLO set the pace along the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane and drew off under a drive. INSTINCTUAL prompted the pace three wide,
had aim outside of the winner turning for home, continued on the left lead and was clearly second best. DIAMOND COOL pressed the pace two wide
between foes and weakened through the lane. TRIPLE START bumped at the start and never threatened while racing three and four wide. CAJUN
OCCASION was outrun inside. CHACHARERO bumped with TRIPLE START at the start and played no factor while racing two wide. SIR DANIEL dwelt and
trailed inside. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND TOOK NO ACTION.

going into the lane, and kept on for show. NAVAL OFFICER stalked from the four path but was one paced through the stretch. CAJUN PUZZLER tracked
from inside but faded entering the lane. EL BAILADOR was checked back to last early and was always behind.

CHRISTENSEN led while two wide, was cued going into the stretch, and drew clear. BANK FRENZY steadied at the start, raced from behind along the
inside, was driven from the three path into the lane, and ran on for place. BERNARDO'S LEGACY pressed inside, was ridden along while drifting out to the
four path at the top of the lane slightly bothering an outside rival, and held on to show. SOLOMONS GOLD chased in the four path, was roused from the five
path into the lane, bumped with an inner foe in upper stretch, and finished evenly. SPINNING MUSICIAN broke out and bothered an outer foe, stalked in the
three path, was bumped while in tight between rivals at the top of the lane, but was one paced. CUTIE chased from inside but was empty going into the
stretch. GOTTA GO GATOR was hustled along from off the pace but was never a threat. RED DOG tracked from two wide early but backed out around the
turn.

Footnotes
RYE SENSE OF HUMOR stalked the pace in the two path around the first turn, advanced three wide around the far turn, took over near the quarter pole
and drove clear leaving the eighth pole. THENORTHREMEMBERS settled off the early pace while racing three wide, edged closer four wide around the far
turn and ran on to gain the place. TAP GOLD set the pace in the two path, was collared near the five-sixteenths pole, vied inside of foes past the eighth pole
and held well enough to preserve the show. DAZZLING TRUTHS raced off the pace two and three wide and lacked the needed rally. HEAT OF THE NIGHT
prompted the pace in the three path, briefly led between foes near the five-sixteenths marker and weakened in the lane. MR. SARCASTIC failed to menace
while racing two wide. KING THEO chased the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. YOUCANTCATCHCURLIN hit the starting gate, raced three wide and
never threatened. BENELUX played no factor while racing two wide. ESPECIALLEA was off slow, trailed in the two path early, went four wide around the far
turn and made little impact. OSPREY was outrun inside.

Footnotes
NARUTO bumped with an outer foe at the start, dueled for the early lead from inside, was cued from the two path into the stretch, opened slightly in upper
stretch and held sway. ADIOS PAPA CHICO got bumped between rivals at the start, stalked in the two path, took aim from the five path into the stretch, and
ran on for place. CATALINA EXPRESS prompted the pace while three wide, swung out to the seven path into the lane, but finished evenly for show.
SWEET SIDE chased in the four path, floated out to the eight path in the stretch, but was one paced. FORTHELOVEOFART dueled for the lead from two
wide early, was ridden in the three path going into the lane, but faded. DOLLAR BILL raced from wellback in the four path early and was no menace.
PLUMA ROJA trailed throughout.

Footnotes
POPPY'S BOYS raced in range four wide, was put to a drive while racing two wide around the far turn with little evident response, continued on the left lead
in the lane, kicked in under strong hand urging leaving the eighth pole, split rivals late and was in time. WICKED FINN stalked the pace two wide around the
first turn, dueled outside of FLY THE W down the backstretch, in the three path around the far turn and to deep stretch, won that battle but was caught by
winner in the later yards. FLY THE W set the pace inside, dueled inside of WICKED FINN from early on the backstretch to deep stretch and was outfinished.
MOMZA was washy pre-race, prompted the pace three and four wide and was one-paced through the lane. RACE CRAFT raced well back in the two path,
swung widest in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. TIMMY M. failed to menace while racing two and three wide. DUBBY DUBBIE had early speed inside
and steadily faded.

Footnotes
NOBLE DRAMA trailed from inside, was roused around the turn while shifting out to the eight path going into the lane, rallied, and surged past in closing
stages. SUPER CORINTO (ARG) stalked from the two path, was ridden around the turn to bid from the five path at the top of the stretch, led passing the
eighth pole, drifted out, and was caught late to place. WIND OF CHANGE (BRZ) set the pace in the two path, was coaxed around the turn, yielded to a late
closing duo in the final furlong, but held show. COLLABORATE chased from the five path, was ridden from the six path into the stretch, but finished evenly.
CLAPTON rated in the five path, moved up to take aim from the seven path into the lane, but flattened. AMERICAN PRINCE pressed in the three path but
gaveway entering the lane. SCAR raced in midpack from the three path but was tired entering the stretch. SOLE VOLANTE raced off the pace in the three
path, cut the corner into the lane, but was empty. JESUS' TEAM was hustled along from the inside and was no menace. REAL TALK tracked from the four
path but backed up midway around the turn.
