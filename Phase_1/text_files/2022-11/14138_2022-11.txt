shifted three wide around the three-eighths then moved to four wide, came five wide into the stretch, rallied outside to get the lead into the final furlong then
moved clear under steady urging. CRUPI was caught five to six wide around the first turn, leapt over tracks near the seven-eighths, settled outside at the
rear, chased in the four path around the far turn, made a bid at the quarter-pole, battled under a drive into the final furlong and was outfinished while able to
get the place. AMERICAN HUSTLE went to the front, lugged out two then three wide around the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked
along the rail on the far turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened while able to get the show. JUNGFRAU went four then five wide
between horses on the turn, dropped to the two path at the seven-eighths pole, was hard held while racing with his head cocked to the inside early on the
backstretch, moved up while let out at the five-eighths, contested the pace from that point, vied in the three path around the far turn, dropped back in upper
stretch and weakened. NARCISO DALI was reluctant to load, went three to four wide on the first turn, dropped back at the seven-eighths, settled down the
backstretch, chased in the two path around the far turn, moved out in pursuit of the leaders into the final furlong and came up empty. BEAR'S CORRECT
stumbled badly at the start and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled between horses, brushed

Footnotes
GOLDEN ALCHEMIST was taken in hand early, raced in the three path on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, dropped from the three path to the two
path on the far turn, shifted four wide into the stretch, rallied to take the lead into the final furlong and held under strong urging. ZAIN SARINDA (IRE)
bumped with a rival at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, started the far turn in the two path, shifted three then four wide later
on that bend, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly but missed while clear for the place. WHAT A DUDE
went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch and improved for the show. AL'S
ROCKET went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, went four then three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved out nearing
the furlong marker and also improved position. TRANSACTIONAL (GB) pulled under restraint into the first turn, saved ground on that bend, was rated just
off the pace, started the far turn in the two path, shifted three wide and bumped with a foe coming to the five-sixteenths, made an outside bid at the
quarter-pole then took a short lead, lost the advantage to the winner into the final furlong and weakened. INFLATION ADJUSTED rounded the first turn in
the two path, settled outside while just off the pace, went three wide early on the far turn, was bumped and shoved four wide at the five-sixteenths, came
five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. LEO MONTE raced in the three path on the first turn, moved in while in front early on the backstretch,
showed the way through reasonable fractions, vied inside on the far turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and gave way. RECKLESS SPIRIT was
taken in hand early, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved towards the back, went two to three wide on the far turn and failed to rally. SOULMATE
saved ground while settling off the pace, was asked some into upper stretch, lacked room behind horses coming to the furlong marker then moved out and
also lacked the needed kick. LIAM'S BLUE MOON was fractious in the gate, showed early speed, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, was taken
back off the pace late on that bend, switched to the outside then stalked the leader, was asked in the two path on the far turn and came up empty. SON OF
LIBERTY was fractious in the gate, broke in and bumped with a foe, went three to four wide on the turns, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor.
HILLIARD was last to commence then had his path taken, lagged at the rear in the two path, was taken well out into the course leaving the far turn and was
eased but walked off.

Footnotes
GIVE ME KISSES four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung three wide into upper stretch, got bumped by ANA'S
GUN when her rider directed her out to do so in a try at intimidation that ultimately failed with three-sixteenths to go, took over command at the eighth pole
and dug in gamely to edge away from her main rival and prevail. ANA'S GUN three then two wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter
pole when taking over command, spun just off the inside into upper stretch coming in slightly on the former leader forcing that foe to pause when weakening
before being directed out under threat to bump and intimidate GIVE ME KISSES at the three-sixteenths, got displaced from command at the eighth pole,
fought on inside to be along well clear of the rest and second best. ROYAL POPPY came inwards under hustling at the start carrying in FANCY AZTECA
and MODERN LOVE and pinching back FANCY AZTECA in tandem with MODERN LOVE when that rival had to extract herself from the clubhouse turn
briefly, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.
NOW SHOWING bumped at the start by WAY TOO EARLY who broke inwards, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three
wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. MODERN LOVE got carried in at the start in concert with FANCY AZTECA due to pressure from
ROYAL POPPY coming inwards under hustling, angled out to avoid getting caught in the clubhouse turn and pinched back FANCY AZTECA against
ROYAL POPPY, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, continued
just off the inside into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. WAY TOO EARLY broke in at the start bumping NOW SHOWING, chased four paths off the
inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued along the inside into upper stretch and tired. LEXI'S
SPIRIT showed the way in hand along the inside through swift splits under some pressure to the outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths under
challenge, yielded the front nearing the quarter pole and paused briefly taking the inside route into upper stretch as ANA'S GUN came inwards, then tired in
the stretch. JUST NORTH chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. FANCY AZTECA got
carried in at the start by ROYAL POPPY coming inwards and was bumped between foes before being pinched back, chased just off the inside growing
detached at the tail of the field, went five wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact.

Footnotes
MOZAY bumped with a rival at the start, jostled an opponent early, was rank into the first turn, went around that bend in the two path, was reserved off the
pace, gained three then four wide on the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead into the final furlong then moved clear
under steady handling. EXPAND THE MAP (IRE) went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage
under a drive in upper stretch and was outfinished while able to get the place. MESAORIA jostled with a foe early, moved in to save ground on the first turn,
settled off the pace, advanced two then three wide on the far turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, took the lead into upper stretch, lost the advantage
to the winner into the final furlong and was also outfinished but held the show. WAR PRINCESS jostled with rivals early, was keen into the first turn, went
three wide on that bend, settled off the pace, gained three wide on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch, chased under a drive into the final furlong
and lacked the needed kick. FIVE PRIZES lagged at the rear while saving ground, swung four wide into the stretch then moved further out and improved
position. DIAMOND STATUS went three then two wide on the first turn, was well placed in third position, saved ground on the far turn and lacked the
needed response. WESTERN LANE saved ground on both turns and failed to threaten. BELLESHAZZA pulled under restraint into the first turn, went four
wide around that bend, settled on the outside, was urged three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. LIBRETTO (IRE)
bumped lightly with a foe at the start, stalked the pace on the outside in the two path, was asked on the far turn, chased into the stretch and came up empty.
SISTER MAC went around the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch and faltered.

Footnotes
FUNNY HOW chased three then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take over nearing the
eighth pole and edged clear to prevail. RUVIES IN TIME chased two to three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch,
proved no match for the top one while along clear of the rest and second best. PRETTY CLEVER chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. SHADOLAMO chased three to four wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. VALLELUJAH coaxed from the start, chased three wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. HAPPY SOPHIA chased along the inside under coaxing
from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. HONEY MONEY coaxed from the start, chased along the inside under
coaxing from midway on the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, made no impact. QUALITY STONES coaxed from the gate, showed the way in
hand along the inside widening away from the rest, came under coaxing just off the inside at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in leg weary
and was overhauled just outside the eighth pole, then stopped backing away through to the finish.

Footnotes
ALOGON was hustled to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, controlled the action while inside on the turn, spun off the rail at the quarter-pole,
drifted out in upper stretch and held under strong urging to prevail at big odds. TRUST DADDY settled off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn,
came six wide into the stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed strongly to get the place. YARROW was urged along on the inside, saved
ground on the turn, came out four wide into the stretch, rallied in the final furlong and finished with good energy to just miss the place while up for the show.
KING ANGELO settled off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and finished willingly but missed the trifecta.
SOSUA SUMMER settled off the pace, moved in with a half-mile to run, shifted from the inside to the two path midway through the turn, came four wide into
the stretch then tipped a bit further out, chased between foes into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. JAVA BUZZ bumped lightly with a foe at the
start, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path around the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and weakened.
AFTER FIVE was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and lacked the needed resonse. SUGAR GRAY LEONARD broke in and
made light contact with a foe, settled on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. TRAINER
PLEASE stumbled at the start and was off a bit slow, moved up towards the inside, saved ground around the turn and came up empty. JUST JEREMY
came outward shortly after the start, chased the pace, made a bid at the half-mile pole, vied in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and
capitulated. JUST SAY WHEN settled off the pace, was urged four wide on the turn and was no factor.
