Footnotes
FLASHY BREW stalked along the inside, ranged up outside of the leader entering the lane, drove clear in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead,
changed over entering the final sixteenth, and held sway from a trio of chasers late. POPULIST chased outside of the eventual winner while in the three
path around the turn, got outmoved by that foe nearing the lane, drifted to the five path while sustaining a chase, ran on to gain place nearing the furlong
grounds, and narrowly lasted from rivals on either side for that position late. MAINTAINANCE MATT laid off of the pace three wide, then stayed on between
horses in midstretch to bid inside of POPULIST for place in the final sixteenth, but just missed. UNDERDOG settled two wide, swung six wide in upper
stretch, and offered a belated kick outside of rivals, but missed reaching a minor reward. BETTER WATCH OUT raced in midpack along the inside, and
chased from just off of the rail through the lane without menacing. IMPACT PLAYER trailed around the turn, and surpassed tired rivals late. DREWZANO
tracked in the two path, chased in the three path in upper stretch, then yielded between horses at the furlong grounds. HUG THE MUNNY sped clear early
on, but offered little resistance to the eventual winner in upper stretch, and stopped.

Footnotes
TOTAL MALICE vied two wide, led at the nine sixteenths pole, showed the way from a pressing outer foe around the far turn, then drove clear of that drifting
rival approaching the furlong grounds. BELLAMY CAY stalked three wide, moved forward to press approaching the far turn, prompted the leader from the
three path around that bend, but failed to keep pace while lugging many path out from a strong left handed crop approaching the final furlong, and ran on to
stave off inner foes for place. ROMANTIC BEAST vied inside of the eventual winner for the opening half mile, but failed to keep pace leaving the nine
sixteenths pole, chased around the far turn, then kept on through the lane to once again vie for place in the final furlong, but was denied. IZEONPOINT
broke a bit in at the start, raced in midpack along the inside, then two wide and between horses around the far turn, and chased evenly. J Z'S FIRST trailed,
failed to progress three wide around the far turn, and played no factor. VITA tracked two wide and between horses early on, but backed out to trail at the
nine sixteenths pole, and never got involved.

Footnotes
MAU MAU trailed in the three to two path around the first turn, gained in hand while moving forward between horses turning for home, smoothly swung five
wide entering the lane, and rallied to drive past the leader a sixteenth from home. SUPER WISE was restless in the gates awaiting the start, set the pace in
the two path, showed the way from a prompting foe around the far turn, shook clear of him entering the lane, held sway through midstretch, but was
overhauled at the sixteenth pole, and fended off an outer rival for place through the late stagfes. ROCKDALE got antsy in the gates after an inner foe acted
up, tracked inside of foes while a bit off of the rail, shifted out to the four path to be outside of the top pair turning for home, grinded away in pursuit of the
clear leader through upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival at the furlong grounds, kept on to bid for place, but was denied. GREELEY WENT
WEST saved ground off of the pace, pursued from behind the leaders around the far turn, but only managed to chase through the lane. EXCHEQUER
stalked in the four path, moved forward down the backstretch, pressed the leader from the three path around the far turn, but yielded among foes turning for
home. TIO BLAS lacked speed in the four to five paths, and made little impact. FIFTEEN LOVE BACK laid off of the pace two wide, trailed entering the far
turn, and was outrun. POST CLOSE stalked in the three path and between horses, but failed to sustain that position with nine sixteenths to go, and
weakened in the four path around the far turn.

Footnotes
A G'S CHARLOTTE laid unhurried in the two path, launched a rally three to four wide turning for home, took aim on the leader in upper stretch, bid at the
furlong grounds, determinedly sparred through deep stretch, and prevailed late. WINNING ROMANCE stalked the clear leader from many lengths off,
ranged up outside of her to bid at the three furlong pole, forged an advantage entering the lane, drove clear as a pair of outer rivals menaced in upper
stretch, shifted out to meet A G'S CHARLOTTE's challenge in midstretch, resisted through the closing stages, but was bested late. FORT POLK tracked
along the inside, closed in on the leader in tandem with an outer rival entering the far turn, but had to pause while hemmed in behind the leader at the three
furlong pole altered course outside of the top pair entering the lane an outer outer A G'S CHARLOTTE rallied alongside, took aim along with that rival in
upper stretch, but was outkicked at the furlong grounds, tipped inside of a drifting foe in the process, and leveled off. WHOLELOTTAMO tracked three wide,
chased the leaders around the far turn, but was outkicked by the eventual winner turning for home, and kept on mildly. SHE'S GONE D'WILD never got
involved. MISS KENNEDY tracked from midpack along the inside, but gave way around the far turn. CHEAPSKATE DIVA ran off in the four to three path
around the first turn, saw her wide margin diminish after tucking to the rail nearing the far turn, got headed at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened.
SHELLI'S ANGEL broke a bit in at the start, and showed little.

Footnotes
NORAH G was last away, rushed to a four to three wide tracking position approaching the turn, loomed a danger while producing a bold bid outside of the
leader turning for home, drove clear of that foe in upper stretch, and held sway. HOPEITSMYLUCKYDAY set the pace in the two path, met NORAH G's
challenge turning for home, proved no match in upper stretch, and remained well clear of the rest. MICHELLES LIL STAR stalked outside of the top pair
early on, tucked behind them before pausing briefly two wide and between horses entering the turn, tracked before shifting to the four path turning for home,
and ran on. GUITAR WOMAN veered out and bumped a foe at the start, laid off of the pace three wide and between horses around the turn, then sustained
a chase after shifting ground outwardly entering the final furlong, but failed to menace. AGAMI lacked speed four wide, and kept on. SHES A LUCKY
REBEL was stubborn loading, then broke a step slowly, but avoided trouble from an inner rival by doing so, then raced off of the pace along the inside, and
lacked a bid. DAT GUITAR broke slowly before shying from an outer rival soon after the start, trailed around the turn, and moved up between horses in
midstretch. QUEEN TRIGGER prompted the pace two wide, but chased the leader entering the turn, and faded. TAP IRON FIST lacked speed along the
inside, and never got involved. HIGHLY WICKED was bumped and bothered by rivals on both sides at the start, then failed to factor two to three wide.
STRAWBERRY SUNDAE broke in and bumped a foe at the start, then shied from an outer rival in the early stages before making little impact. JAZZ JAZZ
JAZZ chased along the inside, but weakend.

Footnotes
FREE DROP MADDY prompted the pace while tucking two wide, vied around the turn, assumed command at the five sixteenths pole, and drew off under
moderate hand urging through midstretch before being put to wraps entering the final sixteenth. ADDI BUG tracked two wide and between horses, but was
pinched back and steadied out of tight quarters entering the turn, trailed, picked up stride while fanning four wide entering the lane, then stayed on while
hanging on her left lead, and claimed place entering the final sixteenth. DON'TCALLMEPATSY rushed five wide to chase the leaders, tucked four wide while
putting inner foes to tight quarters entering the turn, shifted down three wide interfering another foe at the five sixteenths pole, sustained her chase to gain
place at the three sixteenths pole, but lugged inwardly while hanging on her left lead in midstretch, and yielded. STARSHIP JAMBALAYA tracked three to
two wide and between horses, but gave way turning for home. DOLLY'S GUITAR raced forwardly along the inside while rank behind the leader down the
backstretch and into the turn, sustained chasing position before bidding for place between horses in upper stretch, but was herded a bit inwardly leaving
midstretch, and leveled off. PURSUIT L'HARMONIE brushed with rivals on both sides soon after the start, pursued four to three wide while among foes, but
steadied when an outer rival shifted down at the five sixteenths pole, and faded while floated out entering the lane. CCED FOR STEPH broke out, set the
pace inside of the eventual winner entering the turn, but proved no match at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened.

Footnotes
MOTIVATING took mild bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, saved ground while tracking in midpack, smoothly slipped inside of foes entering the
lane, sustained a rail charge to bid in upper stretch, led entering the final furlong, and drove clear. PRINCE COSMO set the pace, inched clear of a pressing
foe while a bit off of the fence at the three furlong pole, but allowed rail room for MOTIVATING to move through in upper stretch, resisted that foe's rail bid at
the three sixteenths pole, but was bested at the furlong grounds, and held place. SPEED WARNING stalked along the inside, claimed place while tipping to
the three path turning for home to be outside of the leader, but got outkicked by an inner rival while failing to sustain progress in upper stretch, and chased
the top pair home. DE SAIX tracked four wide, then chased through the lane while hanging on his left lead. MYREDWHITEANDBLUE broke out to open
space, laid off of the pace, shifted from the two path to the five path in upper stretch, and improved. NATURAL RED shied from inner rivals at the start,
raced at the rear two wide, shifted out four wide entering the final sixteenth, and moved up between horses late. WOLF HUNTER broke out and brushed a
foe while the rider lost his right iron at the start, saw him recover that stirrup-hold a sixteenth of a mild later, then made little impact along the inside. MO
MOVES stalked three wide, but yielded between horses. LA BOUCANE brushed an inner foe at the start, pressed two wide under steady urging, but failed
to keep pace before weakening between horses at the five sixteenths pole. LUCKY AIN'T ENOUGH broke a beat slow, got hung five wide while off of the
pace, and gave way.

Footnotes
OVA CHARGED stalked three wide, loomed a danger in the three path outside of the leader around the turn, assumed command nearing the lane, kicked
clear in upper stretch, tired mildly through the final furlong as her stablemate gave chase, yet safely held sway while being ridden out. SPIRITED BEAUTY
chased two wide, tipped to the four path entering the lane, gained place in upper stretch with multiple lengths to find on the leader, then mildly narrowed that
margin while holding place through the late stages. SNOWBALL rated at the rear along the inside, moved forward between horses turning for home before
fanning five wide in upper stretch, and stayed on willingly. FAME FEATHER lacked speed two to three wide and between horses, got floated five wide
entering the lane, and failed to menace. DROP DEAD SEXY set the pace two wide, then inside of the winner while a bit off of the rail around the turn, but
proved no match turning for home, and weakened. MEDLEY raced at the rear three to four wide, and made little impact. LAKE MARIE prompted the pace
along the inside, but chased an outer pair into the turn, then weakened while drifting out in upper stretch. SUMITUP broke through the gate and dislodged
her bridle while escaping her rider's grasp leaving the stalls, but was well corralled and kept from running off, then re-loaded without further incident, lacked
speed in the five to six path, and gave way. MISS JANA broke in at the start, chased along the inside, but faltered after a quarter mile, and steadily
weakened thereafter.

GALAXY THIRTYSIX trailed, cut the corner entering the lane, rallied with many lengths to find on the embattled pair in the final furlong, closed in stoutly in
the final sixteenth, reached late, and reeled in the leaders at the wire. ZYDECO MUSIC rushed to prompt the pace three wide entering the turn, sparked a
duel with the pace setter turning for home, clung to an advantage in the long duel through the lane, but was outkicked by an outer oncharging foe at the
wire. OURPERFECTPRINCESS set the pace before encountering a pair of challenges into the turn, gamely sustained a duel with ZYDECO MUSIC after
being headed turning for home, but failed to regain even terms while getting outkicked late. FORBIDDEN FRUIT tracked in the two path, shifted out to the
four path entering the lane, but gave way. SHACKLELACKALACKA rushed to vie for the lead two wide and between horses into the turn, but yielded at the
three furlong, and weakened.
