Footnotes
DETERMINEDLY was forwardly placed racing three-wide while in hand, took the lead nearing the stretch, quickly drew clear and drew off to win without
need of urging. SHOPPER'S REVENGE was allowed to settle in stride, came four-wide into the stretch, angled further out fot the drive and finished strongly.
SUN THUNDER was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch, split rivals during the drive and was rallying late. DESERT WOLF never far back
racing behind horses, swung out to come five-wide into the stretch, offered a bid nearing the eighth pole and then flattened out. PRAIRIE DUNES dropped
back early, came seven-wide into the stretch and gained some ground late. SMILE MON was off a step slow, then saved ground to the stretch, angled out
for the drive and passed tiring rivals. MY SANCTUARY dropped back early and failed to seriously threaten. SENSE YOU ASKED tracked the pace from
along the inside to the stretch, angled out four-wide for the drive and weakened. TOP D'ORO disputed the issue to the stretch from along the inside and
weakened. FAME vied for the lead while racing two-wide and tired during the drive. NOISES OFF was closed up early while racing five-wide and gave way.

Footnotes
TOWHEAD saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged, opened clear nearing the eighth pole and maintained a safe advantage. MIJA
saved ground stalking the pace, angled out to be three-wide entering the stretch and finished strongly. HARMONICA vied for the lead from along the outside
of Towhead, could not stay with that one late but held on well for the show. COMPARATIVE was reserved off the early pace, came five-wide into the stretch
and finished in a mild rally. NO GUILT hopped at the start, then was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch, split rivals during the drive and gained
her best stride too late. ROSES AND ROZAY saved ground while being reserved off the early pace, slipped through entering the stretch, but lacked a rally..
WITS AND WAGERS saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through on the turn and passed tiring rivals. TWO MINUTE LICK was in tight and
steadied nearing the three-quarter pole, then moved up closer along the inside on the backstretch but was unable to seriously threaten. TIVALI prompted
the pace from along the outside, came four-wide into the stretch and weakened. STAY LOST was three-wide early while racing in the middle of the pace,
came four-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. SWEET SWEETFANTASY dropped back early and was not a factor. THEROANRUNNER raced
five-wide and gave way after five furlongs.

VICTORY FORMATION vied with Joking Way for the lead from along the inside, led between calls in the stretch, lost the lead nearing the eighth pole, then
responded to pressure to come again late and prevail narrowly. TWO EAGLES RIVER was allowed to settle in stride early, moved up three-wide entering
the stretch, took a slight lead nearing the eighth pole and then just failed to last in a game effort. LUGAN KNIGHT was reserved off the pace, rallied
four-wide into the stretch and finished well in a steady effort. JOKING WAY dueled for the lead from along the outside into the stretch and weakened slightly
late. WELAKA was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. LORD GRANTHAM dropped back early, came three-wide
into the stretch and gradually improved his postion. COFFEE CALIENTE saved ground racing in the middle of the pack and failed to threaten. GOLD LUCK

game effort. DEER DISTRICT was reserved off the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch, could not reach the top two but finished well in a steady
effort. DONEGAL FACTOR settled in stride early, came three-wide into the stretch, angled in for the drive and flattened out. SUITABLE dropped back early,
came four-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. GOOD HEART tracked the pace while racing two-wide but had no response when asked. B
MINOR was allowed to settle in stride, came two-wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. COUNTERSPY dropped back early, rallied four wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten. CURLINS INCHARGE saved ground while being unhurried and failed to be a factor. SCOOTERANDDABIGMAN bobbled

RED CARPET READY tracked the early pace while racing two-wide, took the lead from Twirled nearing the eighth pole and gradually drew clear late.
TWIRLED saved ground setting the pace into the stretch and held on well for the place when headed. KEY OF LIFE saved ground while being reserved off
the pace, steadied nearing the three-eighths pole while in tight along the inside, angled out for the drive and finished willingly. BAYTOWN LOVELY dropped
back early, came four-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. THE GREAT MAYBE settled off the early pace, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter
pole, drifted out to be five-wide entering the stretch and flattened out. TELL ME WHEN was prominently placed for a half mile while racing two-wide and
tired.

CONFIDENCE GAME saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged and was fully extended to prevail narrowly. ROCKET CAN stalked the
pace racing in hand, moved up two-wide to offer his bid nearing the quarter pole, disputed the issue from that point but wasn't quite good enough in a game
try. TEN DAYS LATER was unhurried early, moved up three-wide on the turn to improve his position and finished fast. HIT SHOW bobbled shortly after the
start and dropped back, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. TRAFFIC MASTER dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch
and improved his position. HIGHWAY ROBBER was close up early while saving ground but weakened during the drive. TRES SOLES tracked the pace for
five furlongs and tired. MO'S TREASURE settled in the middle of the field early, came five-wide into the stretch and gave way. MUST BE THE MONEY was
prominently placed for a half mile, appeared to take a bad step and was quickly pulled up and vanned off.

Footnotes
POWERFUL dueled for the lead from along the inside, drifted out slightly entering, responded to pressure and edged clear late. MR BOB saved ground
while being reserved off the pace, slipped through during the drive and finished strongly. FROSTED DEPARTURE was allowed to settle in stride while
racing three-wide on the turn, angled out to be five-wide entering the stretch, offered a bold bid nearing the eighth pole but wasn't quite good enough.
ACCIDENT was unhurried after being off a step slow, rallied six-wide into the stretch and gained his best stride too late. TOP RECRUIT vied for the lead
racing two-wide, was bumped by Bourbon Bash nearing the eighth pole and weakened. BOURBON BASH settled in stride early, rushed up four-wide to join
the leaders on the turn, came in to bump Top Recruit nearing the eighth pole and tired. MOUNSIEUR COCO prompted the pace for a half mile while
three-wide and gave way.

the best. KNOCKYOURSOCKSOFF was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch, split rivals during the drive and finished strongly. PRETTY
MISCHIEVOUS tracked the pace racing along the inside, angled out to come four-wide into the stretch and finished well in a steady effort. PURE PAULINE
stalked the pace while racing two-wide, moved up to gain a slight lead nearing the quarter pole but lacked the needed late response. DEFINING PURPOSE
was allowed to settle in stride, rallied five-wide into the stretch and finished willingly. T MAX set the pace to near the quarter pole while saving ground and
weakened when headed. AMERICAN ROCKETTE saved ground while being close up early and gave way after a half mile. TAKE CHARGE BRIANA
dropped back early, gave way after a half mile, was wide on the turn, then was pulled up and vanned off.

when clear. HAYES STRIKE bobbled at the start, then dropped back, rallied six-wide into the stretch and finished fast. RED ROUTE ONE settled in stride
early, came three-wide into the stretch, lacked room , was brushed nearing the eighth pole, found room late and finished willingly when clear. DENINGTON
was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and found his best stride too late. GIGANTE set the pace from along the inside, responded when
headed but wasn't quite good enough. CYCLONE MISCHIEF tracked the pace racing in hand, moved up to take the lead nearing the quarter pole, vied for
the lead into the stretch but lacked the needed late response. FREEDOM TRAIL was prominent from the start, moved up three-wide to offer his bid nearing
the quarter pole and weakened slightly late. WESTERN GHENT dropped back early and was outrun.

Footnotes
GUN PILOT prompted the pace racing two-wide, took the lead from Itzos nearing the quarter pole and quickly drew clear. MOBSTER was prominent from
the start , rallied three-wide into the stretch, could not reach the winner but was clearly second best. TALLADEGA was unhurried early, came three-wide into
the stretch, was brushed by Midnight Pranks while splitting rivals nearing the eighth pole and finished well when clear. GLOBAL PRIDE was close up early
while racing three-wide, came five-wide into the stretch to offer a bid and went evenly late. HALLOW POINT dropped back early, came seven-wide into the
stretch and was gaining late. MIDNIGHT PRANKS track the pace while racing two-wide, was four-wide entering the stretch, came in slightly to brush with
Talladega nearing the eighth pole and weakened. WINGER hopped at the start, then was unhurried, rallied five-wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals.
KING D'ORO saved ground while being prominently placed but lacked a rally when asked. ITZOS saved ground setting the pace to near the stretch and
tired. BACKSIDE BUZZ settled in the middle of the field, came four-wide into the stretch and tired. ALL ABOUT CROGE was not a threat while racing
five-wide. PINFIRE trailed the field and was not a factor.
