Footnotes
ACTION POTENTIAL sped clear, enjoyed a loose lead in the two to three path around the turn, held sway in the four path from a chasing foe through
midstretch, but flopped back to her left lead leaving the sixteenth pole, yet held. POINT OF VICTORY tracked along the inside, gained place turning for
home while tipping outside of the clear leader, took aim on that foe from the five path in upper stretch, but only managed to slowly narrow that foe's margin
through the final furlong. KICK N KISS rated at the rear along the inside, shifted to the three path entering the lane, and stayed on to reach show a sixteenth
from home. CUSTOM FOR CARLITA tracked from midpack two wide, then chased from behind the leaders through midstretch, but lost show to an outer
rival at the sixteenth pole. NEW YEAR'S PARTY raced at the rear in the five path, and surpassed outer tiring rivals in upper stretch. HALFGLAMOROUS
stalked the leader from the three path while inside of a foe, but was outmoved by an inner rival nearing the lane, and faded while floated to the five path
entering it. MOMENT TO DREAM stalked in the four path, but faded after floated to the six path entering the lane.

Footnotes
LADY CHURCHILL set the pace along the inside, shook free around the far turn, but was confronted by an outer bidder in upper stretch, got headed at the
furlong grounds, fought on while her outer counterpart wandered, regained an advantage while as the duel continued through the closing stages, and
narrowly prevailed. MO BLING tracked three wide, bid at the three sixteenths pole, forged a narrow advantage from the pace setter at the furlong pole, but
wandered about slightly from alternating crops as her inner counterpart fought on through the late stages, hung, and was bested in the battle.
KITTENOFTHE COURT prompted the pace two wide, chased the clearing leader turning for home before getting outkicked for place entering the lane, and
kept on to chase the top pair home. AVERI EVER AFTER broke a step slowly, trailed, and made little impact. MEET ME never got involved. LOVELY LADY
MAY broke slowly, recovered to stalk along the inside, but wilted entering the far turn, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
CRYPTOZONIC settled far back two wide, shifted out turning for home before swinging six wide entering the lane, rallied while shifting ground inwardly
approaching midstretch, collared the leader leaving the furlong grounds, sparked a duel in the process, inched an advantage late, and prevailed. MR.
PRODUCTION set the pace inside of a sternly pressing rival into the turn, drew clear of him leaving the five sixteenths pole, showed the way off of the fence
before being confronted by an outer foe inside the final furlong, battled gamely thereafter, but was bested. D TWO laid off of the pace three wide, rallied
while fanning five wide entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, drifted out leaving the furlong grounds, yet kept on after
straightening, and gained show at the wire. JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT saved ground towards the rear, rallied along the rail to take aim inside of the leader
coming to the furlong grounds, but leveled off soon after, and got nailed at the wire for show. OPTIMAL COURAGE chased two wide, but yielded three wide
and between horses turning for home. NOSY BANKER stalked along the inside, but gave way between horses at the five sixteenths pole. ROCKY BAR SIX
pressed the leader in earnest, but weakened with five sixteenths to go.

Footnotes
BEAUREGARD staggered a step inwardly at the start, tracked two wide, took aim three wide entering the lane, grinded away on her left lead to bid inside
the final furlong sparking a duel with the leader, possibly took a brush from that foe while sparring in the final sixteenth, yet determinedly prevailed.
EVERLOVINGHAND stalked the top pair, bid three wide into the far turn, drew clear turning for home, dug in to resist BEAUREGARD's challenge in the final
furlong, possibly shifted out and brushed that foe while clinging to an advantage in the final sixteenth, but got nailed at the wire. BATTLE OF WILL settled off
of the pace along the inside, swung from the four path to the nine path entering the lane, rallied to take aim on the top pair in the final furlong, but did not
have enough to reel them in. SILVER GALAXY hopped slightly and came out multiple lengths slow after a delayed start, trailed, improved five wide into the
far turn, checked slightly when crowded between horses coming to the furlong grounds, and moved up late. HALF AGAIN set the pace along the inside, but
was headed around the far turn, and gave way. GRIEF tracked along the inside, but faded around the far turn, yet sustained his chase after shifting out
entering the lane. MR. FOUR SEVENS laid off of the pace three to four wide, but was outkicked in upper stretch before shifting out coming to the final
furlong, and faded. STANDING MAN broke a bit out at the start, pressed two wide, but wilted between horses around the far turn.

Footnotes
NOT ON HERB leaned in and squarely bumped an inner rival at the start, pressed before vying two wide and between horses into the turn, led in upper
stretch, shook clear coming to the final furlong, and held sway. CALICOCO chased two wide and between horses, tipped three wide turning for home, but
got keen behind rivals in upper stretch causing him to veer inwardly soon after, tipped back three wide in midstretch while staying on, then altered course
outside of a rival in the final sixteenth, and sustained his charge to reach place at the wire. LATE SEPTEMBER tracked four wide, ranged up turning for
home, took aim on the clear leader coming to midstretch, but failed to progress in the final furlong, and got nailed at the wire for place. KING'S LUTE tracked
along the inside, shifted two wide turning for home, and chased. BLACKTECA set the pace, showed the way from a pair of hounding rivals entering the turn,
sparred with them turning for home, but was headed in upper stretch, and gave way. FLASHY BOY prompted the pace three wide, bid turning for home, but
weakened between horses leaving the quarter pole. BISPING stumbled at the start while still breaking with the field, and never got involved. PROBLEM
CHILD received a substantial bump from an outer rival at the start, and was outrun.

Footnotes
MISS SHIPMAN tracked in midpack four wide, claimed place in upper stretch with many lengths to find on the clear leader, then sustained her charge after
flopping back to her left lead entering the final sixteenth, ranged up to the faltering leader nearing the wire, and just got up. MASTER SOM quickly cleared
off, maintained a wide margin through midstretch, but tired entering the final sixteenth, and could not quite last to the wire. HAYUNEVANO stalked in the two
path, but was outkicked for place in upper stretch, and kept on. CAMP AKEELA raced in midpack in the three path, tucked around the turn, then lacked a
bid through the lane. OATH OF ALLEGIANCE tracked along the inside, but was shuffled back substantially and lost many lengths of position behind a
faltering MUNNDIVA nearing the turn, then recovered around the bend, and stayed on. IM SINGLED UP lacked speed three wide, shifted to the six path in
upper stretch, and made little impact. MUNNDIVA chased along the inside, but steadied out of possible tight quarters along the rail leaving the half mile
pole, and quickly faltered approaching the turn. EARLY DAWN stalked in the three path, but weakened between horses entering the lane. KAYLEE LOU
trailed, checked lightly behind troubled foes entering the turn, and was outrun.

Footnotes
WHO TOOK THE MONEY laid off of the pace in the five path around the first turn, gained while floating to the seven path entering the lane, then sustained
his charge while hanging on his left lead to drive past the leaders entering the final sixteenth. BEHEMAH STAR tracked two wide gained between horses at
the nine sixteenths pole, stalked from behind the top pair around the far turn, tipped three wide entering the lane to take aim, grinded away to bid outside of
the leader at the furlong grounds, but exchanged contact with that foe in the process, vied as an outer rival loomed a danger soon after, and got outkicked
leaving the sixteenth pole. HIGHLAND CREEK prompted the pace inside of a rival before decisively backing off to stalk outside of that foe entering the
backstretch, ranged up turning for home to bid entering the lane, gained an advantage in upper stretch as an outer foe took aim, but bumped with that foe
while clinging to an advantage at the furlong grounds, got headed soon after, and gave way. MORE MEMORIES raced in midpack four wide, tucked to the
two path down the backstretch, tracked before swinging to the five path entering the lane, but only managed to chase thereafter. BIG CHOPPER set the
pace two wide before clearing entering the backstretch, showed the way in the two path, but was headed in upper stretch, and gave way. MAGA MAN
tracked thee wide, chased around the far turn, but yielded between horses while floating to the six path entering the lane. COSMIC TRAIN was taken back
while failing to keep pace with foes on either side in the opening stages, trailed while very far back, and passed tired rivals. TREYS MIDNITE MOON never
got involved. MAGEEZ brushed the outer part of the gate, and was outrun. GRAND LUWEGEE stalked along the inside, but weakened around the far turn.
