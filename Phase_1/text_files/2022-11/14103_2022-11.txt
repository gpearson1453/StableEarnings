Footnotes
EBBEN was hustled from the gate, moved up outside the three-quarter pole then took the lead inside that pole, showed the way under mild pressure, vied in
the two path on the turn, responded well when asked outside the quarter-pole, came under the crop in upper stretch and drew off under strong urging.
BOURBON CALLING broke last but one, settled off the early pace, moved up outside the half-mile pole then was taken in hand, saved ground while in good
striking distance around the turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch and secured the place while no match for the
winner. PRINCE OF PHAROAHS was asked leaving the gate, showed speed and set the early pace, came outward near the three-quarter pole then lost the
lead, pressed the winner from that point, was urged along in the three path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired while well clear for the
show. AMERICAN POWER tracked the pace on the outside, was taken in hand briefly when the leader came out in front at the three-quarter pole, dropped
back while placed under urging shortly thereafter, moved from the five path to the three path around the turn, came back out five wide into the stretch and
had nothing left. WINTER POOL was forwardly placed on the outside, chased in the four path around the turn and retreated. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS was
last to commence, dropped well behind the rest of the field, went around the turn in the three path and trailed.

Footnotes
ROUGH DRAFT dueled from the two path with RIPE FOR MISCHIEF to his inside, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under
a drive taking sole command a furlong out, held on under late threat at the finish. EMPIRE SKY chased two to three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick and missed at the end. RIPE FOR MISCHIEF coaxed from the gate, dueled inside
of ROUGH DRAFT from the get go, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front near the eighth pole
and kept on to preserve the show honors. DREAMPOINT chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild bid. FUOCO broke in at the start and was corrected, settled three to four wide just off the duel, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BRENNAN'S WAR got bumped and squeezed back at the start
conceding four lengths to the front, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. SHARP SENSATION grew fractious and broke open the stall door at the start before
cantering through sans rider but was expertly and quickly corralled by the assistant starter and head starter and reloaded, broke out at the start bumping
BRENNAN'S WAR into CAPLETON against pressure outside coming from FUOCO and squeezed that inner pair back at the break, chased along the inside
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. CAPLETON grew fractious in the gate inspired by the
aforementioned foe, then got bumped between foes and forced to steady when squeezed back conceding five to six lengths to the front, chased four to five
wide early on before tucking inside into the turn, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
KHAFRE broke very fast then was hustled, dropped in while carried in by a foe, was well placed just off the pace, saved ground around the turn, was asked
along the rail in upper stretch, battled inside of the pacesetter into the final sixteenth and got up under strong handling. HATCH raced on the outside,
brushed with a foe near the nine-sixteenths, tucked into the three path leaving the backstretch, moved to the four path midway through the turn, brushed
with a rival outside the five-sixteenths then went to the five path, chased the leader into the final sixteenth and finished with good courage to just garner the
place. GASLIGHT moved out at the rear near the nine-sixteenths, was urged along while shifting from four to six wide around the turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive and improved outside to just miss the place but was up for the show. OUTASITE angled in while going to the front, showed the way
down the backstretch, vied in the two path around the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while weakening
and lost the trifecta. WIN FOR GOLD was last to commence then hustled, came under a hold when the leaders crossed in front then was taken up while
tugging keenly at the bit around the five-eighths, moved out shortly thereafter, shifted from the two path to three path early on the turn, brushed with a rival
outside the five-sixteenths then shifted four wide, pursued the leader under a drive into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked. DRINK THE WIND lost his
footing at the start and broke last but one, moved up between foes around the five-eighths then brushed with an opponent, advanced to press the pace on
the outside, vied in the three path around the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
SWEETEST PRINCESS five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three to four wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter
pole, took over command at that station and went five wide into upper stretch, edged away under a drive kept to task. MISS FASHIONISTA chased three to
four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to secure the place honors. KARA PARA
coaxed from the gate, led early on four wide until displaced from the front six and a half furlongs from home, tucked to the two path into the turn and
advanced to take back the front at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got headed at the quarter pole and spun three wide for
home, then weakened in the late stages while well clear for the show honors. SWEET BLUSH six then five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. JOEY THE FISH stumbled badly at the start conceding at minimum six to seven
lengths to the front, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn detached at the tail of the field,
went six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. QUEENPIN coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed just off the inside advancing to take over six
and a half furlongs from home, came under challenge into the turn and yielded the front with seven-sixteenths to go, faded through the turn and spun just off
the inside into upper stretch, then got eased home to the finish. STARTS NOW chased along the inside, came under coaxing just off the inside at the
seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and was eased through to the wire.

Footnotes
PERSONAL BEST was taken in hand early then well placed while saving ground, drafted in dead-aim of the leader around the final turn, took over in the two
path into upper stretch then kicked clear, drifted in under a right-handed crop into the final furlong and proved much the best while kept to the task under a
hand-ride in the final sixteenth. RHOMBIQUE went around the first turn in the two path, settled on the inside of a rival while saving ground, held a good
striking position along the rail around the final turn, angled out impatiently outside the quarter-pole then bumped a foe while reaching the four path, chased
outside into the final furlong and earned the place while no match for the winner. ENSEMBLE (IRE) was carried in while last to commence, raced in the two
path while reserved at the rear, moved to the three path late on the far turn, hesitated some behind a spill nearing the quarter-pole then came four wide into
the stretch, dropped in while asked for her best in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths and improved for the show. CAIRONI broke in at the start, settled on
the inside, was urged along around the final turn and lacked the needed response. MY LIPS ARE SEALED was bumped on both sides after the start then
checked while pinched back, traveled in the two path under reserve, went three wide around the final turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and failed to
rally. HOME FOR CHRISTMAS went to the front from the outside post, rounded most of the first turn in the two path then dropped to the rail, showed the
way through quick fractions, lost the lead to the winner into upper stretch and gave way. UNRULY JULIE settled in the two to three path, came under
encouragement on the final turn, was forced out six wide outside the quarter-pole then steadied and had a foe clip her heels, spun six wide into the stretch
and capitulated. LADY THORNHILL saved ground on the first turn, moved to the two path nearing the stretch for the first time, tracked outside in the two
path from that juncture, inched closer late on the backstretch, was asked on the final turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.
RUN UP THE SCORE bumped twice with a foe after the start, lugged out some while keen in the four path around the first turn, tossed her head some while
continuing keen early down the stretch for the first time, was rated outside in the three path, came under urging at the five-sixteenths, was bumped and
forced out six wide outside the quarter-pole and had nothing left then was also eased in the final furlong but walked off. EVER SUMMER bumped with a foe
shortly after the start then was squeezed back in tight between foes, went three wide around the first two turns, was reserved on the outside, raced four

Footnotes
SOUTHERN FLAG three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to be between foes through the final furlong, dug in to take command just inside the sixteenth
marker, then gamely fended off a rival by the bob of the head to prevail on the wire. AMERICAN LAW coaxed from the gate, chased just off the pace six
paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide into the turn, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung five wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge in tandem with the aforementioned foe to the leader a furlong out, collared that rival as a team inside the
sixteenth pole, fought on gamely knocking heads to the end but was ultimately denied by a noggin at the end. VODKA MARDINI coaxed from the start,
showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under light coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and was collared just inside the sixteenth marker, ran on well clear of the rest to preserve the show honors.
CHUCKA MOON stumbled at the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and
weakened. GOLDEN PURCHASE chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired.

NEURO bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, was forced out inside the
three-sixteenths, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed well to get the lead coming to the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under good handling. BAR
FOURTEEN moved up under urging then was well placed just off the pace while inside of a rival, drafted inside to the two path around the turn, angled out
inside the three-sixteenths then bumped with a foe, chased in the final furlong and finished willingly to just get the place. FRANK'S ART settled near the
middle of the field, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, gained into the final furlong, moved out near the sixteenth-pole and
improved for the show. RUNNINGWSCISSORS settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn, moved out behind a drifting foe in upper stretch
and gained to just miss the show while up for the last spot in the superfecta. NOT PHAR NOW bumped solidly with a foe at the start, disputed the pace on
the outside then in the two path on the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, fought on well into the final sixteenth then weakened and missed the
superfecta. PHANTOM SMOKE angled in while going to the front, contested the pace on the inside of an opponent, vied along the rail on the turn, turned
into upper stretch under strong urging, fought on into the final sixteenth then tired. BATTLE STATION bumped with foes on both sides at the start, settled
towards the rear, was roused in the two path on the turn and gained ground but failed to impact. KLICKITAT was hustled from the start, raced towards the
rear, went three wide on the turn and never reached contention. GHOST GIANT broke in then made light contact with a rival, went three to four wide on the
turn and was no factor. DEEP COVER chased the pace on the outside in the second flight, went two to three wide on the turn, was bumped inside the
three-sixteenths then checked and capitulated. GONGHEIFATCHOY was last to commence, saved ground towards the rear and failed to threaten.

flattening out in the late going. NORMAN QUEEN broke in at the start bumping KANT HURRY LOVE, dueled inside of BUNTY WINDERMERE coming
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, got shaken off nearing the quarter pole and spun two to three wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. DOC
DOC ROCK coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from midway on the turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.
BUNTY WINDERMERE dueled from the two path with NORMAN QUEEN to her outside, shook off that rival near the five-sixteenths and was set down
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, got collared with three-sixteenths to run and folded.

Footnotes
DURKIN'S CALL bumped with foes on both sides at the start, was coaxed along off the pace, moved up with a half-mile to run, was asked in the two path on
the turn, shifted four wide outside the quarter-pole, rallied to the lead in upper stretch and drew away under steady urging. LIL COMMISSIONER showed
speed on the inside of a rival then pressed the pace, took the lead in the two path at the seven-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner under a drive in
upper stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. JACK THE CAT was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and improved for the
show. SUPPLY CHAIN was last to commence, raced behind a foe early then angled in at the back near the three-quarter pole, was urged three wide on the
turn, moved out near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response then just missed the show. MONARCHS GLEN (GB) settled at the rear, was
urged three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch then quickly moved further out and failed to threaten. BUSTIN THE RULES came out and
bumped with a foe at the start, moved out leaving the chute, advanced closer with a half-mile to run, chased four wide around the turn, moved to six wide
outside the quarter-pole and came up empty. KUMAR was sent hard from the start, set the pace on the outside of a foe, lost the lead to that rival at the
seven-sixteenths, vied in the three path around the turn and tired. SUPER WICKED CHARM was ridden along on the outside, went four wide on the turn,
came five wide into stretch then moved further out and was no factor. SCOTTY bumped with a rival at the start, moved out under urging leaving the chute,
advanced closer late on the backstretch, chased three wide around the turn, moved to five wide outside the quarter-pole and capitulated. O SHEA CAN U
SEE was urged along near the back, saved ground on the turn and faltered.
