Footnotes
FASHION DIVA set the pace from the two path into the first turn, continued on a clear lead down the backstretch and through the far turn, remained clear
with an eighth to go and stubbornly held. LIEUTENANT KITTY settled off the pace while in the two path, bid three wide through the far turn, got closest to
the winner into the lane then chased the winner through the lane and settled for second best. PRESCIENCE trailed through the turns, came into the lane
from the four path and moved up for the minor share. Z ZS RED chased the winner into the turn while in the two path then lacked a response through the
lane. TIMELESS GLORY saved ground throughout and tired.

Footnotes
OUT WORK'N chased the pace from the two path into the far turn, took over near the three-eighths pole, cleared soon after, widened into the lane, was all
out late with challengers stacking up three wide and just lasted in a game effort. ROUNDER was unhurried while near the inside, was asked for more in
mid-turn, came into the lane from the three path and steadily gained through the lane and just missed between rivals. SHIPSHAPE was unhurried while off
the inside through the turns, asked for more from the three path in late turn, came into the lane from the three or four path, gained on the winner from
mid-track, looked a winner with a sixteenth to go and just could not get up. SKYLINE set the pace from the two path on a clear lead, relinquished the
advantage into the far turn without resistance, kept on from the three path into the lane and was clear of the next one. KILLER BEE raced in the four to the
three path through the turn when in mid-pack, came into the lane from the six path and offered a mild gain while not a factor. ASHWINS ORB never a factor
while along the inside. SHOTGUN JOE chased the pace from the two path into the turn and was done soon after mid-turn. WEAPON was in the three path
through the far turn and tired.

BLUSHING BELLE chased the pace from the two path into the turn, moved to press the pace two wide and in the four path through late turn, was carried
into the six path into the lane, dueled with the leader to inside the sixteenth pole and edged up. B G WARRIOR set the pace while in the two or three path
through the turn, entered the lane from the five path, dueled with the winner to inside the sixteenth pole then yielded. KISS ME ON OCONEE tracked the
pace along the inside through the turn, had a wide open rail into the lane then lacked a closing response. WORLD UNITE settled off the pace while in the
three path, bid in late turn from the three then four path, came into the lane from the six path, had aim on the top two when straightened then weakened late
and lost the show spot. VIOLENT WONDER was unhurried while in the two path through the turn and into the lane and lacked a closing response. RIGHT

SOMEONE SAID SO dueled outside of a foe, bumped that one inside of the three-sixteenths pole, dueled and then prevailed under steady urging. LADY
DEMAREE dueled inside of the winner, was bumped inside of the three-sixteenths pole, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished. Following an
inquiry and an objection by the rider of LADY DEMAREE against the winner, the result was allowed to stand official. RUNUP and OFF RAMP stalked the
pace outside and closed late. EASYONMYEYES and WAY TOO SMARTE had mild late bids while not threats. ALBERTA SUN saved ground to no avail.
The race was hand timed due to a timer malfunction.

Footnotes
HER WAY stalked the pace in the four path, bid at the quarter pole and was in time under mild urging. ANAITA was clear early, lugged out late and was
caught. MOLLY'S WARRIOR raced in the three path, bid belatedly outside and missed. TIME TO CONFESS stalked the pace in the three path, bid on the
turn, then yielded late. SPLASH OF TONIC saved ground, bid at the quarter pole but missed. BAND OF ROSES was off awkwardly, then raced in the five
path. IDAREYOUTODANCE saved ground to no avail.
