FIRELINE forwardly placed five paths off the inside dueling early on, chased five then four wide advancing on the leader in hand to take over command with
five-sixteenths to go, swung four then three wide into upper stretch, went clear given some rein to work with and briefly urged, then prevailed comfortably in
hand to the finish. GUNS N' GRACES broke out at the start, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside under coaxing from
the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. SERENA'S COURT three to four
wide down the backstretch, tucked two to three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered two to three wide into upper
stretch and improved position for the show honors. AVANT coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch, took to the inside straightened away and weakened. ACCIDENTAL ICON coaxed from the start, chased six then five wide

ATHWAAQ retained the advantage after out-breaking the completion, got set up in the two path, was rated along showing the way on a loosely-contested
lead, entered the lane and began to drift out slightly, struck the three-sixteenths pole and saw the pilot go to work, continued to drift outward with the rider
applying strong pressure on the right side as a corrective measure, held late to preserve the decision. HIT THE WOAH taken hold after shying a bit to the
outside and away from the errant SHORT SUMMER DRESS, made it over to the rail in time for the commencement of the run around the bend, flashed
some interest tipping to the outside and being asked for more as the half was being completed, got maneuvered towards the middle of the course and into
the five path soon afterwards, narrowed in on the top one en route for the place. KEEPER OF TIME (IRE) settled towards the back of the pack after the field
had been sent off and running, approached the turn from the three path but was soon re-positioned one closer to the rail, got moved out spinning into the
lane until four wide, rallied for the show. MAGGIE'S BID shied a bit at the start, travelled three wide for the opening half, was a couple paths wider for the
stretch run, made no headway. AMALFI PRINCESS three wide on the turn, gave way after going a half. ZELDA (FR) keen after being pinched at the start,
dragged herself into the pocket, cut the corner into the stretch, came up empty and backed away . SHORT SUMMER DRESS broke to the outside, got
tucked into the two path after correcting course, angled about four wide into the stretch, had no gaiin.

BATTLE BLING showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled through sensible splits, shook away through the latter portion of the turn and got
set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under growing threat through the final furlong and held safe to prevail. NOSTALGIC chased
two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, closed well through the final eighth but was ultimately rebuffed
at the end. FIRST TO ACT chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued in the two path into
upper stretch and tired. W W FITZY chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and faltered.
EXOTIC WEST leapt up striking the right side stall at the start and lost the rider in the process, got apprehended by outrider down the backstretch and was
walked off under her own power. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the start focusing on EXOTIC WEST before the result stood and the race was declared

three to four wide through the first turn, tipped five paths off the inside briefly attempting to throttle down some of the eagerness before gradually tucking four
then three wide down the backstretch remaining hard to handle, tucked to the two path into the far turn and was shown the crop to the right side through
most of the bend to prevent getting out then got placed to brief coaxing and swung out to head five wide into upper stretch, was wrapped up straightened
away and eased home to the wire.
