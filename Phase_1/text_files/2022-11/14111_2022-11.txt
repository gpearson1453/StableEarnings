Footnotes
YOUR INHERITANCE stalked the pace from the rail, swung out in upper stretch, kicked in and drew off under a drive. LIL ANNIE ROSE prompted the pace
two wide, was pushed out a bit by the winner in upper stretch, could not match strides with that foe and was along late for the place. SOPHIA'S STORM set
the pace along the rail, led pas the eighth pole, drifted out under left-handed urging and weakened. SHES A GIFT hopped at the start, raced two wide and
never threatened. SOUTH PACIFIC played no factor while racing three wide. COUNTLESS DREAMS chased the pace three wide and came up empty in
the lane. SOUPER DUPER READY had brief speed four wide, lost contact around the turn, was eased through the lane and walked off.

ASHFORD GIRL set the pace from inside, opened up into the stretch, and just held on. BALLETIC bumped with an inner rival at the start, tracked in the four
path, shifted in to cut the corner into the lane, made progress to bid from two wide in the final furlong, but was too late. JUST KATHERINE chased in the five
path, floated out to the seven path entering the stretch, and finished evenly for show. SHEZ SPEIGHTFUL broke in at the start, rated from the three path,
and passed tired foes in the stretch. LOVE RHAPSODY bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the three path but flattened down the stretch.
MOONLIGHT VISION had an unprepared start, was hustled along from inside but faded in the stretch. CONSTITUTIONALIST trailed throughout in the six
path.

Footnotes
HAZARDOUS HUMOR settled off the early pace outside, advanced three wide around the far turn, closed outside and was up in deep stretch. ROYALLY
BLUE set the pace in the two path, kicked clear in upper stretch, led to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. BLUSTERY pressed the pace in the three
path, could not keep pace with the top two in the lane but held well enough to save the show. MISZLO lacked speed, advanced four wide around the turn
and had a mild rally. MARACAS BAY chased the pace two and three wide and faded in the lane. MACHTENHAIRONFIRE failed to menace while racing
three wide. BOSTON PRINCESS had brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
SIXTY ONE tracked inside, tipped out to the four path into the stretch, and rallied between rivals to get up late. EXALTED CHARM prompted the early pace
from the three path, was ridden from the five path into the lane, and ran on for place. ENSIGN PARKER led in the three path, opened up around the turn,
kept on in the stretch but was caught by a closing duo late to show. SMALL REASON rated in the two path, swung out to the six path into the stretch, but
was one paced. KUHL STAR was behind in the five path early and never factored. LEE ANN'S WARRIOR stalked while two wide but faded in the stretch.
ORIENTAL PARK raced from wellback in the four path and was no threat. FROLIC MAN was bumped by an inner foe at the start, chased in the five path
but was empty in the stretch. NORTH CAUCASUS broke out and bumped an outer foe, raced in midpack from the four path, lost action midway around the
turn, was pulled up and unseated near the quarter pull, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
GUNESH pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead between foes around the far turn, drifted out a path nearing the eighth pole and drew clear under
a drive. JAN'S GIRL raced off the pace while pulling four wide around the first turn, advanced outside down the backstretch, bid four wide midway around
the far turn, was not quite as fast as the winner in upper stretch, was forced out by that foes near the eighth pole, switched leads back and forth and lasted
for the place. DOUBLE COSMO GIRL raced off the pace three wide, angled to the rail near the eighth pole and rallied for the show. TIZ KOBE TIME chased
the pace two and three wide and was one-paced through the lane. RITA MARGA set the pace in the two path and tired in the lane. MARTINI'S AMICA was
outrun inside. CURLIN'S COLEEN raced off the pace four wide, made some progress around the far turn, had little left for the drive and bled. REACHING
STRIDE played no factor while racing three wide. AN OBJECTON LODGED BY THE RIDER OF JAN'S GIRL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

SEPTEMBERTEN trailed from the five path early, ranged up four wide around the turn, bid from the six path in upper stretch, and drew past in the final
furlong. SLIM SLOW SLIDER was hard held and stalked along the inside, took the lead from the three path into the stretch, drifted out through the stretch,
and was caught late to place. AGARRAMESIPUEDES tracked between rivals, cut the corner into the lane, and kept on for show. HERCULES rated in the
four path but finished evenly in the stretch. FIRST RULE pressed in the three path but yielded midway around the turn. BRACCIO DI FERRO prompted the
pace in the four path but was empty going into the lane. LORD JAXSTON set the early pace from inside but was tired after a half. DUE TO A TIMING
MALFUNCTION THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
MR TITO'S settled off the pace outside, cruised four wide around the turn, reached near even terms approaching the quarter pole, continued on the left lead
in the lane, vied outside of SEA TRIDENT and edged ahead in the final sixteenth. SEA TRIDENT prompted the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing
the quarter pole, vied inside of the winner to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. AIN'T WASTING TIME saved ground in range, tipped two wide in upper
stretch and was up for the show. THE BIG GREY saved ground off the pace, angled four wide near the quarter pole and ran on for a minor award. AEQUOR
set the pace along the rail and weakened in the lane. HIGH YIELD KITTEN pressed the pace two wide and tired in the drive. VALID EXCHANGE trailed in
the two path.

Footnotes
MR MATUSCHEK rated in the three path, moved up to take aim from the five path entering the lane, and rallied late to get the bob. OFFICER COUNTRY
raced in midpack while three wide, moved up to make a bid going into the stretch, and kept on for place. TELEPHONE TALKER stalked from inside, shifted
out to the six path in upper stretch, and ran on late for show. PLENUM prompted the pace from two wide into the first turn, settled back in the three path
down the backstretch, bid between rivals entering the lane, but evened out late, BARONE CESCO set the pace in the two path, was roused from the rail into
the lane, but flattened out late. CAUSALISTIC trailed while saving ground but was no factor. KITTEN'S SPA tracked from two wide early but was no threat.
HEY PORTER raced from wellback between rivals but was no menace. THRESHOLD chased from inside, swung out to the seven path into the lane, but
was empty.
