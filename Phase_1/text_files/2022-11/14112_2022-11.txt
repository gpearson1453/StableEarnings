HAPPY SAILS broke readily, prompted the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn, took over in upper stretch and went clear under a right
handed tap. BALIMOS tracked the leaders between foes in the opening stages, angled inwards nearing the half mile marker, saved ground on the bend,
tipped out racing into upper stretch to advance between rivals and proved best of the others. SURE WASN'T ME, urged to the lead along the inside from the
break, dictated terms on a narrow advantage in the first three furlongs, disputed the pace into the turn, couldn't match the winner nearing midstretch and
gave way. PRETTY IN PRADO lunged at the start, recovered quickly to track the leaders three deep in the opening stages, then continued evenly between
rivals while failing to make an impression. EVIE JEAN, off last, then held up momentarily along the inside, switched outside rivals racing through the
backstretch, continued widest into the stretch but offered no rally.

Footnotes
KREWE CHIEF was bumped between horses in the opening strides, settled at the rear, was pushed along between horses in the rear group near the three
eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, drifted out in upper stretch, nonetheless rallied and engaged outside of the leaders midstretch, began to drift
back in, led near the sixteenth mark and drove clear. PACHI settled near the rear inside of KREWE CHIEF, continued at the inside of the rear flight on the
turn, turned for home behind traffic, found space between horses near the three sixteenths pole and split horses, led midstretch, was headed by KREWE
CHIEF to his outside near the sixteenth mark and chased on second best. OSCAR WINNER WALLY broke outward into KREWE CHIEF, disputed the early
pace between horses, settled back past the five eighths to chase the leading flight, was pushed along three wide on the turn but continued well off the pace,
was driven three wide in upper stretch, was slow to kick on but found a rerally in the final sixteenth and improved well belatedly. RIDE RICHIE RIDE was
bumped in the opening strides by KING TITO as a result of OSCAR WINNER WALLY breaking out, disputed the early pace four deep, edged to a defined
lead into the turn, set the pace in the three path, came into the lead with a narrow lead, was engaged by PACHI to his inside in upper stretch and headed by
that foe midstretch, and flattened out in the final eighth. MIND YOUR OWN BIZ was reluctant to load, got sent for speed inside, disputed the pace down the
back straight, tracked RIDE RICHIE RIDE while saving ground on the turn, was driven inside in upper stretch and weakened. KING TITO was bumped
between horses in the opening strides, disputed the pace three wide early, tracked the leading pair in the four to five path on the turn, was driven five wide
into the lane, drifted out, and weakened.

Footnotes
MISTER KELLY broke readily, prompted the pace between rivals, then outside JACK VAN BERG racing into the turn, pressed the issue into upper stretch
and edged forward under firm handling to go clear late. JACK VAN BERG was urged disputing the pace inside rivals from the outset into the turn, tipped off
the inside racing into upper stretch, couldn't contain the winner late but kept on to save the place honors. FIGHT ON, urged to a forward placing along the
rail, tracked just off the leaders along the rail from the outset to midstretch, then switched out three deep in late stages to just miss for second. STALLONE
was rated in the opening quarter while shifting to the inside racing into the bend, angled out five wide racing through the stretch and continued with interest
to make some mild progress to the end. MEDAL OF FACT, urged to a forward placing four wide racing through the backstretch, lost ground to the leaders
entering the turn and faded into upper stretch. AZRAEL angled inwards tracking the pace between foes racing to the turn, was prompted to advance three
deep into the lane but came up empty midstretch. TALKTOEACHOTHER lost his footing at the start while breaking awkwardly, settled outside a rival in the
last flight racing to the turn and never gained contention. SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY tracked off the first flight five wide on the backstretch, continued widest
into the turn and steadily retreated into the stretch.

Footnotes
SHEZA SAVAGE was sent for pace inside, tracked DOLLY'S LINE after that foe sent to the lead, tracked the leading pair while saving ground into the lane,
was urged into the lane and angled two wide in upper stretch, rallied to the lead near the three sixteenths, soon cleared, and kept finding enough under a
drive to hold a clear advantage to the finish. PALACE MAGIC broke slowest but advanced to track the leading trio inside foes early, gradually improved
position in the turn while racing in the four path, raced four wide into the lane, chased on willingly, could not reel in SHEZA SAVAGE but finished a clear
second best. VOODOO FIRE settled toward the rear, raced in the four path on the turn, swung four wide into the lane, drifted out but nonetheless rallied
under a drive and continued to gradually improve position to the finish. SENORITA AURORA settled near the rear, hugged the rail on the turn, continued
along the rail into upper stretch, and rallied mildly past tiring horses. RUNAWAY A. TRAIN tracked the early pace three wide, was pushed along into the turn
for a bid, tracked the leader in the three path on the turn, was driven three wide in upper stretch, gave chase to midstretch and flattened out between
horses. CAIRO SUMMER chased midfield down the backstretch and in the five path on the turn, came five wide into the lane and lacked the needed rally.
IRISH HALO broke a bit awkwardly, settled at the rear, raced in the five path on the turn, was driven four wide into upper stretch and lacked a bid. DOLLY'S
LINE was sent hard between horses for the lead, cleared approaching the half, set the pace while saving ground on the turn, carried a diminishing lead into
the lane, was headed at the three sixteenths and emptied out.

OPTION came through close quarters at the start, was urged to the lead inside foes racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the
far turn, then grudgingly held KEEN RESPONSE through the stretch to prevail under left handed pressure. The latter, shuffled back avoiding close quarters
at the start, switched outside foes dropping out last to the backstretch, responded when called up to advance on the leaders four wide racing into the far
turn, loomed outside the winner in that path racing into upper stretch and contested the issue willingly to the end while failing to gain even terms. BON
DEUX angled to the rail in early stages tracking just off the leaders under light rating, continued along the inside into the far turn, swung out five wide
entering upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for a share. MORANT, pulling a bit along the inside racing just behind the second flight in the
opening stages, switched off the inside racing to the first turn, angled back to the rail nearing the second bend, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the
needed final kick. KING ZION, urged between foes prompting the pacesetter from the outset to the far turn, gave way into the lane. TOWN CRIER broke
readily, was caught four wide racing through the first turn to the backstretch, shifted in nearing the second bend to lodge a brief, three wide bid between foes
nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. MEMPHIS THEPROPHET, held up between foes avoiding close quarters racing to the first turn, dropped out
early. GRUMPA was urged three deep between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the backstretch but abruptly gave out racing into the far turn.

JUST RIGHT MIKE disputed the pace between horses early, cleared into the turn, set the pace in the two to three path around the bend, was pushed along
in upper stretch and driven through midstretch, and held safe. CHRISTMAS PRESENT disputed the early pace inside of JUST RIGHT MIKE, settled back to
track the leader along the rail around the bend, was driven inside into the lane, chased on willingly but could not close up the gap behind JUST RIGHT
MIKE. NATURAL CHILL attended the pace outside of the leaders early, settled back midpack into the turn, chased in the four path around the bend, swung
six wide into the lane, and finished mildly outside to secure the show. PO BOY raced midpack early, advanced to track the leader into the turn, raced with
the tracking group in the five path, was driven five wide into the lane, and was outfinished between horses. VALLEY VISTA tracked behind the leaders on
the back straight, tracked the leading pair two wide on the turn, came three wide into the lane, drifted out but nonetheless continued in range to midstretch,
and flattened out while drifting back in. ART HEIST broke inward and was a bit awkward into stride, settled in the rear pair outside of WILDWOOD'S
GAMBLE, continued in the five path in the rear group around the bend, was driven seven wide into the lane and lacked the needed rally. WILDWOOD'S
GAMBLE settled at the inside of the rear pair early, raced in between horses in the rear group on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, chased on
mildly to midstretch and emptied out in the final furlong. FAMA Y DINERO chased inside early, raced toward the rear in the two path on the turn, was driven
two wide in upper stretch and proved empty.

PEACH COBBLER broke sharply, was urged clear setting the pace through the backstretch, repelled a challenge from HALLIE'S RAINBOW racing into
upper stretch and made the balance of the pace under firm handling. BEG BORROW N STEAL, bumped at the start, was collected to to track off the first
flight three wide on the backstretch, shifted inwards entering bend splitting rivals, angled to the inside nearing the quarter mile marker and continued with a
willing effort inside rivals to prevail for the place honors while tipping off the inside nearing the wire. IT'S GREEK TO ME, urged to a forward placing four
wide on the backstretch, continued in pursuit of the leaders three deep into upper stretch and kept on with interest to close the gap while being outkicked for
second. HALLIE'S RAINBOW was urged prompting the pacesetter into the turn, moved to even terms with that rival on the bend pressing the issue into
upper stretch, but yielded to the top trio in late stages. MIDNIGHT'S GIRL tracked off the first flight inside rivals racing into the turn but offered no closing
bid. MORNING LINE NEWS broke outwards bumping BEG BORROW N STEAL, was collected off that foe, then settled last racing to the turn and failed to
menace thereafter. RUNNERS HEAT tracked off the first flight between foes racing through the backstretch but faded from contention early.

Footnotes
LAUDA SPEED pressed the early pace outside of D'FEVER, settled back to track off that foe down the backstretch, reengaged two wide into the far turn,
headed D'FEVER near the three eighths, continued narrowly ahead of that foe into the lane, drove clear near the three sixteenths and kept on in command
to the finish. C F V WICKED RED settled toward the rear, edged closer to midfield in the two to three path on the far turn, swung out to the seven path into
the lane, rallied under a drive, and got up for place just past the sixteenth mark. DIAMOND DAVE settled near the rear, saved ground around the far turn
while still toward the rear, raced two wide in upper stretch, rallied, and got up inside of DANVILLE and WILD FOX in time to secure the show. DANVILLE
chased outside of D' YANK through the first turn, raced at the middle of a well-strung field down the back straight, chased in the two to three path around the
far turn, was driven into the lane four wide, ran on mildly four wide between horses and missed the show. WILD FOX tracked the leading pair, continued in
range in the three path around the far turn, swung out five wide into the lane, continued in range to midstretch, could not reel in LAUDA SPEED, and
flattened out between horses in the final furlong. PROMISING SHOES settled at the rear early while well detached from everyone except PISTOL BOX,
continued in the rear pair down the back straight, saved ground around the far turn, swung four wide into the lane, and passed tiring horses. D'FEVER set
the pace inside while taking pressure from LAUDA SPEED around the first turn, cleared on the lead down the back straight, was reengaged by LAUDA
SPEED into the far turn and headed by that foe near the three eighths, attended the pace inside to upper stretch while driven, proved no match from the
three sixteenths and weakened. D' YANK chased inside of DANVILLE through the first turn, chased well behind WILD FOX down the back straight,
continued to chase the leading trio in the two path on the far turn, floated six wide into the lane, and came up empty between horses. PISTOL BOX settled
near the rear detached from the rest of the pack except for PROMISING SHOES, continued in the rear pair down the back straight, trailed around the far
turn, was not asked in the lane, and walked off the course.

Footnotes
LITTLE MIGHTY MAN, forwardly placed four wide between foes racing through the backstretch, shifted in entering the bend while making a steady advance
on the pacesetter, wrested the advantage from that foe in upper stretch, went clear in late stages and held safe the late charge of EASTER MUSIC under
firm encouragement. The latter, reserved between rivals in the opening furlong, was prompted to advance racing into the bend, shifted out four wide racing
through the stretch, split foes in that path leaving the furlong marker and continued willingly to close the gap. RICHIESGOTSWAGGER, off a bit slowly, was
reserved well off the pace to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch, then tipped out three deep in the closing to make some belated progress between foes
while earning a share. D'ARCHER, forwardly placed five wide racing through the backstretch, continued in pursuit of the leaders four wide through the turn
to upper stretch and finished evenly late. W W KAN DO, urged between foes to gain the advantage after the opening quarter, shifted to the inside avoiding a
loose rival while setting the pace entering the turn, briefly resisted the winner's bid but gave out leaving midstretch. AGAVE KID exchanged bumps with
CHOPPER at the start while being shuffled a bit, settled well off the pace racing to the turn, was held up momentarily while racing in some traffic through the
stretch and had no closing response. BEL BIMBO, eased back to last racing through the backstretch, swung out seven wide to pass some tiring rivals in late
stages but was no real threat. CANDY'S LITTLE TIP, urged to a forward placing along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out entering the stretch and
emptied out in the drive. HIGH HERO, raced off the first flight three deep between foes, altered course midway through the backstretch avoiding a loose
rival, then shifted out five wide nearing upper stretch while failing to menace. BOOM FIVE THOUSAND, off a beat slow, tracked off the second flight along
the inside racing into the bend, was roused to advance inside foes in upper stretch but came up empty late. BORN AGAIN GEORGE, forwardly placed three
wide between foes in the opening quarter, was held up off a loose rival racing past the half mile marker and quickly dropped out. CHOPPER exchanged
bumps while being squeezed at the start, dislodging his rider but was collected by the outrider and walked off the course under his own power after the race.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
