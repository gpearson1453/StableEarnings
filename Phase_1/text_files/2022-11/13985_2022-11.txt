IZE SHARPIE dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and held that
margin to the wire. GAS WAR raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, began a bid from the three path coming off the turn and gained ground
late. MOTORIZED dueled on the outside up the backstretch, battled from the two path around the bend and weakened in the lane. STORMY DAME chased
the leaders through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the three path, and faded in the stretch. ELEGANT EMPRESS raced at the back
of the pack on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn and made no bid.

Footnotes
FLYING CONNECTION chased the leader up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the turn, quickly took command, swung wide
into the lane and drew off from there. PHOENICIAN MAGIC was away from the gate quickly, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up
the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, floated wide entering the stretch and kept on to the wire while proving to be no match for the
winner. FRIENDLY SHUFFLE showed the way through the opening quarter of a mile, relinquished the lead while racing in the two path around the turn and
faded further in the stretch. ROSES ARE GRAY hopped up mildly leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn and was outkicked in the stretch. UNDO THE RIGHT trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no
bid.

AXEL STEEL tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path coming around the turn, kicked clear entering
the stretch, dug in and held that lead to the finish. DIRT ROAD RED raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, began a bid while
racing the three path approaching the three eighths pole, and gained ground down the lane but was outfinished by the winner. SIGALERT led the field
through the opening quarter, gave way while saving ground coming off the turn and weakened further in late stretch. NUMEROLOGIST trailed the field on
the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and offered no kick. PIRATE JUNCTION raced in the middle of the pack between
horses in the opening stages, came around the turn in the two path and flattened out in the stretch. RAISEBEFORETHEFLOP raced in the middle of the
pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
GEE ETTA dueled on the outside up the backstretch, took a slight lead while racing in the three path around the turn and held that margin to the wire under
a drive. OUR ISLAND GIRL tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid while racing in the four path around the turn, gained ground
in the lane and could not go by the winner. KEEP IT ROLLIN raced off the pace on the inside in the early going, came around the turn in the three path and
improved position mildly in the lane. BINGOS SYSTEM was reluctant to load, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the five path
around the turn, swung wide into the stretch and passed tiring horses on the outside from there. ATTACKING GIRL raced off the pace on the inside through
the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the four path and showed no kick. DANIEL'S GIRL dueled on the inside up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn and faded in the lane. SHAKE RAG chased the front runners on the inside in the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and
tired in the stretch.
