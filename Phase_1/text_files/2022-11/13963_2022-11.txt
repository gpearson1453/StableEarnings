Footnotes
GOOD SAM four wide in aim of the top pair, came under coaxing near the quarter pole after being floated out briefly by FOGGY NIGHT and seized
command when swinging three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive coming in slightly a furlong out before edging clear to the finish kept to
task. FOGGY NIGHT pressed the pace of CRYPTO MAMA from the outside in the three path, advanced to take command placed to coaxing at the
five-sixteenths and briefly floated out GOOD SAM, got headed by that rival and spun two to three wide for home, dug in under a drive altering out safely off
the heels of GOOD SAM but hopping as that one rolled by, proved no match for the top one while along clear of the rest and second best. ROSIE'S ALIBI
chased five wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide for home, weakened in the stretch while along clear for the show honors. LA VITA
SOFIA five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing along the inside at the
three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. CRYPTO MAMA stumbled at the start recovering outwards, showed the way in hand
just off the inside under pressure from FOGGY NIGHT to the outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got displaced from the front with
five-sixteenths to go and spun three wide for home, then tired in the stretch. BINSKY chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and trailed throughout. There was a Claim of foul by the rider of FOGGY NIGHT alleging
interference against GOOD SAM in mid-stretch. After review, the objection was dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being
declared official.

ARI GOLD established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled until roused cutting the corner into
upper stretch, then edged clear under a drive to prevail. SCRAMBLE settled just off the inside just off the pace, tipped out three wide placed to coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home willingly while clear of the rest and along second best. FLY
RIGHT along the inside forwardly placed early on, tipped to the two path midway through the first turn and settled tracking the leader in closest aim just off
the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and weakened in the late stages while safe for the show honors.
PALACE GATE tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing just off the inside at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home
and kept on to secure the last major share. MULLINGAR just off the pace along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and made no late headway. MOONFLYER got bumped between foes who each broke his way and was squeezed back at the start,
raced along the inside through the first turn before tipping three paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked back inside into the far turn coming under
coaxing near the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and offered no response. DON'T LET ME DOWN broke in at the start
bumping the aforementioned foe and squeezing that rival back in tandem with FIRE BARON, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung three to four wide for home and tired. FIRE BARON broke out at the start bumping MOONFLYER in concert with the aforementioned rival and
squeezed that foe back between them, chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and made no impact.
SORPRESO chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and tired.

KINETIC SKY forwardly placed from the get-go, disputed the pace as the widest of a threesome on the backstretch, tucked into the three path as that pace
contest morphed into a private spat with MARKET ALERT just after the half had been rattled off, was still locked up with that opponent when asked for more
in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker, had no sooner disposed of that foe when engaged by the runner up, dug in well to stay in front. NABOKOV off
the inside throughout, kept watch on the front runners two to three wide on the bend, swung into action by swinging four to five wide into the stretch, hitched
up to the winner as the pair made their way through the furlong grounds, stayed on but had to settle for second. WILL SING FOR WINE chased the pace
primarily from the two path during the initial six furlongs, was steered out for the stretch until about five wide, went on to secure the show. MARKET ALERT
contended for the pace from between rivals for the opening half, got maneuvered into the two path springing from the half mile pole while going at it one on
one with KINETIC SKY on the bend, turned into the stretch under a drive, fought onward for another sixteenth before giving way.. WAR STOPPER away
last, rode the rail until the three-sixteenths pole, tipped out towards the three path afterwards, made no impact. TRUCULENT two wide onto the turn, angled
out four wide exiting it, came up empty. FOUNDER chased the pace from the three path on the turn, shifted out five to six wide stepping onto the head of
the stretch, had no offering. LAUGHING BOY inside a twosome vying for the lead for the opening half, fell back under a drive on the turn, then fell back

CASCAIS bobbled at the break, dueled from the two path with MAGIADORO to his outside, shook off that rival half a mile from home remaining patiently
handled through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and was roused straightened away, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in
and held well to the finish. SUMMER CAUSE broke in at the start and was corrected, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
continued three to four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to chase the winner home willingly through to the finish. TAPIT TRICE broke out at the
start, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to procure the
show honors. OHANA HONOR broke in at the start, chased along the inside under a ride from midway on the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch
and stayed on one paced to the finish. MCCULLOUGH chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch,
weakened in the drive. GAME CHANGE chased four to five wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. BIG WICKS broke out at the start, chased three then two wide under
coaxing from three furlongs out, spun three wide for home and offered no response. BATTUTA D'ORO chased just off the inside, tucked inside coming
under urging at the half mile pole and advanced mildly nearly running up the hind end of OHANA HONOR near the three-eighths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and tired. MAGIADORO hustled from the gate, dueled from the three path with CASCAIS to his inside, got shaken off half a mile from
home and retreated through the turn to the rear of the field, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and was eased home appearing ready to be pulled
up a furlong out before continuing on to the wire in a canter, then got walked off under his own power.

CHAMPIONS DREAM bumped at the start by TORRONE, who broke outwards, chased four then three wide, swung three to four wide into upper stretch,
got roused at the three-sixteenths and dug in under a drive being directed out two to three paths as the top pair drifted out and was up in the final jumps to
the finish to prevail. FULL MOON MADNESS rated tracking the pace along the inside, came under coaxing and tipped to the two path five-sixteenths from
home, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge and drifting in tandem with PROVE RIGHT, collared the front
with a sixteenth to go under threat to the outside and was caught in the last jumps to the wire. PROVE RIGHT showed the way in hand just off the inside,
tucked inside through the turn and came under coaxing near the quarter pole before being let out taking the inside route at that station, dug in under threat
drifting out inside the final furlong and was caught a sixteenth from home, then weakened in the late stages while well clear of the rest. AMERICAN SPEED
chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. TORRONE broke out
at the start bumping CHAMPIONS DREAM, chased three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide for home, faltered and was eased

Footnotes
WHAT A DUDE tracked just off the inside from mid pack, advanced in the far turn coming inwards and forcing A LISTER to steady near the three-eighths,
came under coaxing near the quarter pole behind foes and angled out bulling his way out and making himself a lane four wide into upper stretch when
bumping and nudging EMPIRE ATTRACTION to the five path, bumped with that foe twice more near the three-sixteenths and again just outside the eighth
pole, rallied to take command near the sixteenth marker before edging clear to the finish to prevail. MISTICAL CURLIN hustled from the gate, showed the
way in hand along the inside, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong from home, ran on to preserve the
place honors on the wire. EMPIRE ATTRACTION grew a bit rank under restraint into the first turn when A LISTER grew a bit erratic under restraint to the
outside, settled tracking the front along the inside in range, tipped to the two path into the far turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole perched two
then three wide outside the top pair, had WHAT A DUDE come along his inside and bull his way out, got bumped and pushed from the three path into the
five path straightened away, attempted to hold the lane and was bumped twice more at the three-sixteenths and then once more just outside the eighth pole,
ran on under a drive to miss for the place honors at the end. ON PALM SUNDAY just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing near
the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. MOST WANTED MAN just off the inside near the rear of the field,
came under coaxing three to four wide at the five-sixteenths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and made steady progress through to the finish while
unable to impact the top quartet. MEDIA SENSATION three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper
stretch and weakened. FIERCE DEBATE chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued two to three wide for home and offered
no response. UNION LIGHTS hustled from the gate, chased three wide under a hard hold into the backstretch, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun two to three wide for home and tired. LABARDE saved ground in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing just off the inside at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and made no impact. LOOKIN GRAND three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six
to seven wide for home, made no impact. MAD MAGIC chased three then two wide coaxed along from three furlongs out, swung four wide into upper
stretch, tired. A LISTER grew rank under restraint just off the inside into the first turn, tracked along the inside pulling on the bit and being wrangled a bit
down the backstretch, was along the inside into the far turn when forced to steady off the heels of WHAT A DUDE when that rival briefly came inwards a the
three-eighths pole, lost position as a result and took the inside route into upper stretch before tiring in the stretch. There was a Jockey's Objection by the
rider of EMPIRE ATTRACTION alleging interference against WHAT A DUDE at the quarter pole as well as a Stewards' Inquiry into the top of the stretch.
After review, it was deemed that WHAT A DUDE had not interfered nor cost a position to EMPIRE ATTRACTION so the result was allowed to stand prior to
the race being declared official.
