Footnotes
CONDORCAT tracked the early fractions, was well placed through the turn while in pursuit of the top pair, rallied along the rail in upper stretch, reeled in
STAN THE CAMERAMAN in deep stretch and kept to task late to prevail. STAN THE CAMERAMAN showed good early speed after an alert beginning, set
a pressured pace through the turn, shook free in upper stretch, was confronted by the winner in the final sixteenth, was outfinished by CONDORCAT and
was well clear for place in the end. ZHIVAGO was unprepared at the start and was away slowly, was rushed up heading into the turn to take a stalking
position, pressed the pace to the quarter marker, could not match strides with STAN THE CAMERAMAN in upper stretch and weakened. CORK MASTER
chased from the inside and was not late threat. MECHANT chased three wide to the quarter marker and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
ASCENDANCY was forwardly placed early on, was floated four wide into the first turn then stalked the pace from a three wide path into the backstretch run,
was roused three wide nearing the top of the lane, took command in upper stretch, held foes at bay in the final furlong and proved best in the end.
NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) rated off of the early pace while not far back, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run, came in tight while along the rail
nearing the quarter marker, angled out in upper stretch, mounted a three wide rally in the drive, could not reel in the winner in the final stages and closed
well in the end to secure second. WORK TO LIVE was hustled leaving the break and prompted the solid fractions through the backstretch run, kept close
attendance to the pacesetter to the quarter marker, chased the winner to mid-stretch, gave way in the final stages and just held for show in the final strides.
COASTARANDO was unhurried, came two wide along the second turn, swung three wide into the drive, showed good late interest and just missed for show
in the final strides. APPLAUD THE BENCH was away in good order and established the early lead, set a pressured pace through the backstretch run, could
not hold off ASCENDANCY leaving the quarter marker and faded.

Footnotes
RUNNING LUCK was well placed in the early stages, maintained position through the backstretch run, advanced nearing the quarter marker, tipped out to
mount a two wide bid nearing the top of the lane, closed determinedly inside of the furlong marker, overtook BENSON in deep stretch and kept to task in the
final strides to prevail. BENSON was sent to assume command of the early lead, set moderate fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, shook
free nearing the quarter marker, was set down for the drive, could not hold off a determined RUNNING LUCK in deep stretch and held for place in the end.
BRITE TAN ran in the second flight while settling off the pace, advanced along the backstretch run, came four wide to the quarter marker, lost ground in
upper stretch, rallied in the final sixteenth and was up in time to secure the show. SHANGHAI MIST showed early speed and was forwardly placed into the
first turn, stalked the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, lost ground to BENSON on the far turn, lost position in upper stretch, was outkicked in
the drive and was edged for show in deep stretch. ARISTEIA rated off of the early fractions, came four wide nearing the quarter marker, swung five wide for
the drive, gained ground in the final sixteenth and did not produce the needed late response. KITTYBE QUICK was allowed to settle, came three wide into
the backstretch run, slipped to the inside approaching the second turn and was not a late threat. FOGGY BOTTOM was slow into early stride, lagged
through the backstretch run, trailed into the drive and was not a factor.

SHOT OF A LIFETIME settled off of the early pace while never far back, advanced three wide on the far turn, vied for the lead nearing the eighth pole, took
command nearing the sixteenth-marker and determinedly held the runner-up at bay in the late stages to prevail. BOTTLE OF SMOKE was unhurried early
on, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run, advanced on the far turn, continued that rally in upper stretch, came within aim nearing the furlong
marker, was outfinished in deep stretch by the determined winner and was second best in the end. UNION DANCE was forwardly placed in the early stages,
advanced on the pacesetter nearing the half-mile marker, pressed the pace to the quarter pole, took command into the drive, held a narrow lead into the
final furlong, could not hold off the top pair in the late stages and held well for show in the final strides. J T'S WATCH was allowed to settle, saved all of the
ground through the backstretch run, advanced on the far turn, came in tight and steadied nearing the top of the lane, lost ground in upper stretch, re-rallied
in the final sixteenth but lacked the needed late response. VIA EGNATIA was hard sent to establish the early lead, set solid fractions through the
backstretch run, was overtaken nearing the top of the stretch and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
SUGARY was allowed to settle, was unhurried through the backstretch run, came three wide into the far turn, mounted a five wide rally leaving the quarter
pole, closed fast inside of the furlong marker, confronted ZELAIA inside of the sixteenth-marker and made a determined late push to prevail. ZELAIA was
prominent in the early stages and stalked the pace from an inside position through the backstretch run, angled out nearing the top of the lane, mounted a
four wide bid in upper stretch, took the lead inside of the eighth pole, was confronted by SUGARY in deep stretch and was nipped on the line for the win,
while besting the rest. YES PLEASE showed early speed, pressed the solid pace while between runners to the far turn, overtook the pacesetter leaving the
quarter marker and assumed command into the drive, could not hold off the top two inside of the furlong marker and was well clear for show in the final
stages. PERFECT ICE STORM stalked the early pace from a three wide position, lost ground two wide on the far turn, chased the leaders to mid-stretch
and weakened. ROSE PRINCESS settled four wide while just off of the early pace, made a middle move to contest the pace nearing the half-mile marker,
vied for the lead while three deep nearing the top of the lane, could not sustain that run in the drive and gave way. STARSHIP ENDEAVOR broke alertly and
showed good early speed to dictate terms, set solid fractions while pressed through the backstretch run, was overtaken leaving the quarter marker and
faded in the final stages. GOING TO SHABOOMS lacked early speed, lagged through the backstretch run, swung four wide for the drive and was not a
factor.

Footnotes
ITS THIEVERY stumbled leaving the break then came in tight on the run into the first turn, settled along the rail into the backstretch run, advanced along the
inside on the far turn, tipped out two wide for the drive, loomed in upper stretch, collared the runner-up inside of the furlong pole and drew clear in the final
stages. TRINIDAD rated off of the early pace while on a hold, advanced along the backstretch run, pressed the pace to the second turn, took command
leaving the quarter marker, was collared by the winner inside of the furlong pole, could not keep pace in deep stretch and stayed on in the end to be second
best. CALI CONQUEST was pinballed at the start and was away a bit slowly, stalked the pace from a three wide path, maintained position to the far turn,
lost ground in upper stretch, did not produce a late rally and was clear of the rest for show. CALCULATED SPIN broke in good order and set the moderate
fractions, was pressed to the half-mile marker by TRINIDAD, was overtaken by that foe nearing the quarter pole, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way.
STRAIT OF GEORGIA raced close to the early pace, was keen along the first turn and a bit hard to place, stalked the moderate fractions through the
backstretch run, dropped back on the far turn and tired in the drive. IMA CARPE DIEM was away slowly, lacked early speed, trailed into the far turn and did
not have an impact.

Footnotes
ANGEL'S ADVOCATE broke sharply and assumed early command, set quick fractions through the turn while confidently handled, extended the lead
nearing mid-stretch, was given a pair of reminder taps in deep stretch and pulled away in the end as much the best. HOT RAGEOUS was shuffled back a bit
leaving the start and was unhurried early on, was roused three then four wide nearing the top of the lane, was no match for the winner in the final furlong but
kept on in the end to be second best. KITTY'S CANDY was allowed to settle, came two wide into the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and passed tiring rivals
late to secure the show. CANAM GAL showed early speed and raced close to the early pace, advanced two wide on the turn, chased the winner to
mid-stretch and tired in the final stages. TIGER QUEEN stalked the solid pace from the inside, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened. WARM
SUMMER was rank in the early stages and pulled between runners nearing the turn, steadied off of heels entering the turn, chased three wide nearing the
top of the lane, swung four wide for the drive and gave way.

Footnotes
DANIELLE'S SECRET broke in and bumped OTTER POP just after the break, was hustled in an attempt to gain the early lead but allowed BOB'S VAI to set
the pace after a furlong while settled into a nice tracking spot behind, launched a bid to challenge passing the three-eighths pole, dueled with that rival
through the stretch, finally put her away in the final sixteenth despite getting bothered late, then fended off a late bid from OTTER POP to the outside to
prevail in a driving finish. OTTER POP got sandwiched after the break, recovered nicely and was able to secure a tracking position behind the leading pair
without being asked, quickened when asked approaching the quarter pole, entered the stretch four-wide, responded to intermittent encouragement from her
rider with a strong late rally that came up just short. BOB'S VAI broke awkwardly, bumped with OTTER POP at the break, was keen to run and fought the
rider for a few strides out of the gate, still managed to secure a clear lead, raced well away from the rail into the turn, relaxed, then responded when
challenged on the outside by DANIELLE'S SECRET, battled gamely down the stretch, veered out a path and brushed that rival late and weakened in the
final yards. MO TOWN GAL lacked early speed and trailed to the turn, saved ground and started a bid from the three-eighths marker, swung out to the
three-path at the head of the stretch, loomed a threat but was repeatedly denied a clear path through the final furlong. PRANCIN N THE PARK last away,
made steady forward progress to the quarter pole while saving ground, had a clear run on the rail for the turn for home and had every chance to make an
impact lacked the necessary response in the final furlong. LEXCELLENT lagged behind after break, chased the field throughout but could not make any
headway. JERSEY BIRD broke sharply from the outside, was not able to enjoin the early pace while wide, continued to lose ground through the turn and
was outrun in the stretch.
