Footnotes
SCINTILLIO stalked off the rail, challenged toward the three eighths pole and dueled at mostly even terms from that point, took the nod approaching the
head of the lane and was steadily handled to hold off JOHNNY SWISH through the stretch, while the latter rated a short lead inside, came under pressure
toward the three eighths pole and dueled at mostly even terms, contested the edge nearest the rail into the far turn, was met toward the top of the stretch
and dug in gamely to late stretch before reluctantly ceding. BET ON BITZ settled off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the
three path and ran evenly in the lane. RUNNER saved ground then bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in
the lane. DATA DEAL saved ground just off the early pace then weakened at the rail on the far turn. FRONT PORCH saved ground racing well off the pace,
eased out with a bid toward the five sixteenths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn and entered the stretch widest. MESMERIZED settled in the three
path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch.

AUBURN MILL raced with the pace through the front stretch, took the nod into the backstretch and came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, kept
the advantage at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled to hold on. BEVERLY PARK stalked in the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the
three eighths pole, raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn then outfinished in the duel through the stretch. BAILEY rounded the first turn
about the three path, left the turn outside and bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and came along to take third the final
yards. MASAI MAN raced with the early pace, was met into the backstretch then challenged toward the three eighths pole, but dropped back at the rail
midway on the far turn and flattened inside the sixteenth pole. NOON TIME GEM saved ground, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded
the far turn near the rail and ran evenly to mid-stretch before flattening stride. TRINGALE rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase leaving the three
eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, angled out into the lane and showed little more.

steady handling to hold on. ALPINE MOON gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, eased out leaving the turn and
closed to take second the final strides while gaining on the winner. INCLUDE THE BEAST contested the pace and took a brief slim lead leaving the five

Footnotes
ATTUCK set the early pace then gave chase toward the three eighths pole, recovered the advantage in the three path of the turn, entered the stretch clear
and held well under steady handling. SILVER CASTLE chased through the backstretch, raced in the three path of the turn, dug in to take second mid-stretch
and just lasted. JAMMIN STILL chased toward the inside, angled to the six path approaching the top of the stretch, finished well and just missed second.
BUCKED TOOTH chased through the backstretch, was carried widest on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. GOLDEN ANSWER chased outside, raced in
range of the leaders in the four path on the turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. VICTORY GIVEN raced off the pace, entered the turn about the three
path but steadied attempting to bear out midway on the turn. FREEDOM IS RINGING was hustled to a brief slim early lead then gave chase toward the
three eighths pole, lacked room off the heels of ZAINO BOYZ NEARING the eighth pole and weakened. The latter took the lead nearing the three eighths
pole and set a pressured pace, was met past the quarter, dropped back midway on the turn and weakened the final sixteenth.
