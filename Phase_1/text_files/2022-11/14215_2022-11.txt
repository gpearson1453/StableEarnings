MIDNIGHT GETAWAY raced off the pace four wide, closed widest while lugging in through the lane, bumped LEGEND repeatedly through the stretch run
and narrowly outfinished that foe. LEGEND tracked the pace three and four wide, rallied between foes, was bumped repeatedly in the lane and just missed
in a game effort. RED GUN saved ground in midpack, tipped three wide in upper stretch and rallied between foes. KEKERE stalked the pace two wide,
tipped three wide nearing the head of the lane, continued on the left lead, took over nearing the eighth pole but flattened out not long after. ADIOS YOUR
HONOR dueled two wide to midstretch and weakened. FLORIDA STAR broke outwardly, raced off the pace three wide and never threatened. GRAND
ROCK dueled along the rail to midstretch then wilted. ARMOR PIERCING had his head turned at the start, raced off the pace inside, swung five wide near
the quarter pole and had no rally. PLUMA ROJA was outrun inside. GOTTA GO GATOR was outrun while racing three wide. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND DISQUALIFIED MIDNIGHT GETAWAY FROM FIRST AND PLACED HIM SECOND.

Footnotes
ALMASHRIQ broke out at the start, set an open pace from inside, was roused midway around the turn, and maintained a clear advantage throughout.
BOBBY'S GIFT rated from inside, was ridden along while swing out to the the six path going into the stretch, and ran on to get up for place late. FULTON
STREET hopped at the start, stalked the clear leader from the two path, was driven into the stretch, but evened out late to show. ROYAL KITTEN chased in
the three path, floated out to the seven path entering the lane, and finished evenly. EPIC RUN tracked the pace from the four path but flattened in the
stretch. ACTION WARRIOR raced from wellback in the four path and never menaced. SONIC KITTEN was outpaced while racing in the five path.

Footnotes
DUNNIGAN came out and bumped DOUBLE BLESSING soon after the start, tracked the pace three wide, bid three deep near the five-sixteenths pole,
dueled outside of D. SILO from there to deep stretch and held firm between foes late. POETIC CODE settled off the early pace while racing four wide
around the first turn, angled into the two path early on the backstretch, edged closer still two wide between rivals around the far turn, angled four wide in
upper stretch and rallied outside. D. SILO stalked the pace two wide, too, over near the five-sixteenths marker, dueled inside of the winner from there, had
the rider lose the whip leaving the eight pole and was outfinished. DOUBLE BLESSING was squeezed back soon after the start, trailed in the two path,
swung five wide near the five-sixteenths pole and lacked the needed rally. BACH chased the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. GRAND SIR bumped
after the start, raced three and four wide and never threatened. DRUM AND DRUMMER set the pace along the rail and faltered leaving the five-sixteenths
pole.

Footnotes
WHAT SAY THEE prompted the pace in the three path, took a narrow lead between rivals while under a hard hold passing the half mile marker, was asked
from the two path turning into the lane, and held gamely. SURROGATE tracked in the five path, was coaxed while ranging up four wide around the far turn,
and ran on in the stretch for place. R ADMIRAL rated from the three path, was ridden around the far turn while drifting out to the eight path going into the
lane, and kept on down the center for show. PAPA JOJO chased from inside, was driven along rounding the far turn while shifting out to the six path going
into the stretch, but finished evenly. ALYANAABI stalked from the four path, was coaxed while three wide rounding the far turn, but weakened in the stretch.
FROSTY PAWS set the early pace from inside but gaveway at the top of the lane.

empty in the lane. BUDDHA BOY was outrun inside. PARADISE DRIVE was bumped at the start, lost contact early, was pulled up in upper stretch and was

MAI TY ONE ON tracked the pace in the three path, was ridden along around the turn to take aim from the six path going into to the stretch, sustained that
run and drew past in the final sixteenth to get up for the win. FAMOUS GENT was hustled along from the three path early, was ridden around the turn while
shifting out to the seven path going into the stretch, and ran on to get up for place late. NEW YORK'S FINEST stalked the pace in the two path, moved up
around the turn, bid from the four path going into the stretch, took a narrow lead in the final furlong, but was caught by two oncoming rivals to finish with
show honors. HIGH PRESS raced in midpack from inside, was coaxed from two wide entering the stretch, but evened out late. BACKWOODS BOOGIE
bobbled leaving the gate, raced off the pace from the five path, shifted into the four path turning into the lane, but finished evenly. INCITATUS tracked the
pace from inside, was driven from the four path into the stretch, but was one paced. EARTH dueled from the three path into the stretch but yielded going
into the final furlong. DEL GRIFFITH rated from the five path, swung out to the eight path going into the lane, but was no factor. HENRY'S WORLD dueled
for the lead from inside but yielded turning into the lane. FRENCHMEN STREET raced from wellback in the two path and never menaced.

Footnotes
MISS NEW YORK stalked the pace from the four path, moved up to bid two wide going into the far turn, opened up from the five path entering the lane, and
held sway. EVIE DOES IT tracked the pace from inside, shifted out to the six path turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. TYPEY was held up in the
three path, was hustled from the five path around the far turn, tipped out to the seven path going into the stretch, and kept on for show. PENUMBRAS
MAKER prompted the pace from the three path early, took the lead midway down the backstretch, but faded turning into the lane. ELLA FRANCES hit the
gate and had to steady while in the in the three path around the first turn, was subsequently wellback and never factored. BEACH READY trailed along the
inside early and was never a threat. R ROSE' ALL DAY led from inside early but gaveway going into the far turn. REE had to steady along the inside around
the first turn, chased from said position but was done after a half.

JOURNEYTOTHEMOON rated from the two path, was roused around the far turn while tipping out to bid from the four path going into the stretch, drew past
an inner rival in the final furlong, and was wrapped up late. JAZZY T broke out at the start, raced from wellback in the four path, was cued to make a bid
around the far turn, led going into the stretch, and dug in but was second best. SWEET PEARL trailed along the inside early, was ridden around the far turn
while swinging out to the seven path entering the lane, and passed tired rivals to secure show. EMIRATES AFFAIR stalked from the two path, was steadied
while floating out to the five path turning into the stretch, and was one paced. MAKE NO MISTAKE raced in midpack from the five path, moved up to bid
from the three path around the far turn, but faded in the stretch. GREY CHARLOTTE tracked the pace along the inside but was never a threat. STREAKING
GREY set the pace in the two path but dropped out around the turn
