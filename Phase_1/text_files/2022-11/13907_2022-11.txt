HE'S A MESS tracked three wide, rallied at the quarter pole and drew even, drew clear in the stretch, dug in gamely late and prevailed. GOOD IDEA was
well placed on the inside, angled out three wide in the stretch, finished willingly but could not get past the winner. RYEGATE STONE set a moderate pace
for three quarters and weakened slightly. LEXATOGA never far back, lacked a late response. FALCONS FURY was no factor.
