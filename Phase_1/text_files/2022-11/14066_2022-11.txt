Footnotes
LITTLE RONS ROCKET stalked the pace into the stretch, responded readily when set down under left handed urging to make the lead at the furlong marker
and won going away. UNEEDTOCOMEHOME pressed the pace two wide into the turn, gained a narrow lead, battled until mid stretch then was no match for
the winner. JOHN'S WILD RIVER away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside for a half then weakened in the stretch. BAILEY ROAD passed tiring
rivals. ANIMO ROBERTO well placed, failed to respond. SOMETHING ON TAP was outrun. CHILTEPIN was no factor.
