Footnotes
TRINITY PARK chased the frontrunner inside through the turn, took closer order at the top of the stretch, assumed command inside at the furlong marker
and stayed on stubbornly to hold at the wire. BIG RANSOM chased the loose pacesetter in the early stages racing just off the rail, rallied between rivals at
the top of the lane, was in contention in the three path in mid stretch and determinedly battled on in the final eighth just missing out at the finish. ARNIE P
broke outwards on the start, was unhurried down the backstretch to trail the field, began to rally three wide around horses into the turn, was in range of the
leaders in the three path in upper stretch, shifted inwards to the fence at the eighth pole and was gaining steadily but could not threaten the top two at the
finish. BLASITO was in a good spot behind the leader after the start, was shuffled back inside at the half to be near the rear at the three eighths pole, saved
ground through the turn and found his best stride in mid stretch to finish with good interest for a minor share. DON'T STOP DREAMIN bobbled at the break,
recovered quickly to show good speed to be up front after the start, opened up on the field under a snug hold at the half mile marker, drifted out midway on
the turn to be in the six path when they reached upper stretch, was headed at the furlong marker and faltered the final sixteenth. KINZHAL settled in midfield
between rivals down the backside, was ridden to keep pace three furlongs from the finish, offered little response and gave way at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
POINT TO THE STARS settled mid-pack stalking in behind, came to the quarter pole four wide, struck the lead about a furlong out, forged clear late.
MUSKOKA GIANT settled inside, came out on the turn to be three wide at the quarter pole, shifted inside about the eighth pole, got up for second inside
under strong urging. JUSTIN'S WAY stalked just off the leader three wide into the turn, took over at the three-sixteenths, was challenged in mid-stretch,
proved no match for the winner, lost place late but held show honors from QUIET INTENT, who broke awkwardly and was urged a bit at the start, moved out
five wide late on the turn, ran on but needed more. FORESTER HUMOR moved clear to dictate the pace racing off the rail, weakened when headed.
RUNNINFORCOVER chased from inside, came up empty. BENLION broke awkwardly, was outrun and distanced, eased through the lane, walked off.
