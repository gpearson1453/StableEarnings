NEED SOME MONEY tracked the pace early, ranged up three wide along the turn, took over command entering the lane and drew away late under a
steady drive. BEST SELLER was fractious in the gate during the pre-start, pressed the pace early two wide, raced in the three path entering the lane and
was no match for the winner late in the stretch run. KEY TO SUCCESS trailed the field early on, raced in the three path along the turn, was in the five path
into the lane while making a bid but weakened late in the stretch drive. HIGH FASHION LADY stalked the pace early, raced near the rail along the turn,
shifted into the three path entering the lane and faded down the lane. FAIR FOLLY was through after a half. FABULOSITY set the pace for a half then
folded up.
