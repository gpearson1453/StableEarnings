NOBLE CRUSADER set a pressured pace and held on gamely in a long drive. BRANDYN pressed the pace while racing between horses, went willingly to
the wire, couldn't get by the winner and was all out at the wire. ECHO CANYON broke out, pressed the pace three wide, fell back into the stretch, closed
steadily and earned show. ACCELERITAS raced inside, rallied on the turn to duel, yielded late and lost position. BRAYBRAY showed speed to the turn and
gave way. ARIZONA STEPHEN broke awkwardly to be off slowly, checked repeatedly along the backstretch and was not urged in the stretch.

off the pace, bid willingly to duel three across, inched away late and was caught. FAMILY BIZ raced close the pace while racing along the inside, dropped
back on the turn, came again inside, shifted out and closed to get up for show. THE BEAT challenged three across along the backstretch, dueled to late
stretch and yielded grudgingly to lose position. ASTRONOMICAL challenged for the lead along the backstretch, dueled to late stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
LIGHT CRUISER raced in the back, advanced along the rail to the far turn, angled out, challenged for the lead, dueled to the sixteenth pole and drew clear.
BROTHERLY LOVE raced in the middle of the pack, closed steadily and got up at the wire for place. GALLANT OAK sprinted clear to set the pace,
responded when challenged to duel to the sixteenth pole, faltered and was caught for second. GUEST CHECK raced close to the pace, advanced to the
turn to loom a threat, bid and hung. ROCKED was slow early, offered a mild bid only and improved position. LUPINO (GB) was not a factor. LINCHTOWN
showed speed to the second turn and flattened out. ATLATL stalked the pace, was checked on the second turn, dropped back and gave way. BEL
RAGAZZO was not a factor.

ORCADIAN STORM broke sharply, vied to turn, drew clear and held under urging. PARLEY STREET was never far back, went nine wide at the top of the
stretch, closed well and gained late. TAINO HOUSE moved up to vie, fell back on the turn, hung late and held for show. MO GEE stalked the pace, bid,
hung and failed to menace. HERBIE raced in the middle of the pack, bid inside on the turn and came up empty late. LIL LATIGO lagged early, bid off the rail
on the turn and lacked the needed late response. KICK IT was not a factor. BEAU GOSSE broke awkwardly to be away slowly, raced in the back, went nine
wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
SECRET MISTRESS stalked the pace while racing inside, angled out on the turn, bid six wide, assumed command near the eighth pole and drew off.
MIDNIGHT BABY was never far back, found her best stride late and got up for place while no threat to the winner. BOLD INTENTION broke out, pressed
the pace, bid willingly to duel, faltered and held for show. BIG AL'S PRINCESS was hustled along, stalked the pace and lacked the needed late response.
BREAKFAST BALL raced mid pack, lacked a bid and failed to menace. HEART ON THE RUN bumped at the start, set a pressured pace and weakened in
the drive to lose position. BIGMONEYHUNNY was crowded at the start and outrun. IT'S CURLIN TIME was not a factor. YOUONLYLIVETWICE raced mid
pack in an even effort and was outrun. PRECIOUS ONE bumped start and showed little. MY CLASSY WIFE was not a factor. CAROLYN'S WAY broke
slowly and showed little.

Footnotes
UNCLE JEFF pressed the pace, closed steadily and wore down his rival to get up late. N. K. ROCKET MAN was sent to the front to set the pace to deep
stretch and was outclosed in a good effort. JOKER MATT raced mid pack, rallied on the turn, closed willingly and was gaining late. COASTAL WATERS
raced in the back, went wide in the drive, finished well and gained late. THE LONGEST NIGHT was restrained at the start, steadied on the far turn and did
not threaten. CLUB MESQUITE raced close to the pace, bid inside to loom a threat and hung late. BODEMONSTER was not a factor. WARRIORS HERO
was off slowly, trailed the field and passed tiring rivals. IN THE MIDST was through after a half. TOUR THE WORLD stalked the pace while racing inside,
advanced to the second turn and stopped.
