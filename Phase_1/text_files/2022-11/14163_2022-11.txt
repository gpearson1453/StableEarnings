Footnotes
SHEISTHEHERO broke well and made the lead soon after the start, set the early pace under pressure, shook clear on the turn, was struck once with a left
handed whip at the furlong marker and won under a brisk hand ride. CEVICHE stalked the pace into the stretch, dug in three wide and finished second best.
LITTLE BIRD FLASH never far back, finished with good courage between horses two wide. SILVER STICK STAIR pressured the winner along the inside
early, chased that one into the stretch and faded late. ANDIAMA was no factor. QUARANTINA had brief speed.

KNOT WILD broke in front, prompted the pace two wide into the stretch, was struck one with a right handed whip after making the lead near the furlong
marker and drew off under a hand ride. SPEEDY FIRE away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside into the stretch and held on for second. WHAT'S
SO FUNNY stalked the pace and went evenly in the four path. CALL TONY was bumped at the star and, passed tiring rivals in the five path through deep
stretch. MISS MARPLE had good early speed along the inside then faded. NOT SHY was no factor. DONTLOSETHATNUMBER broke in tangle, leapt
outward bumping CALL TONY causing her rider to lose his left iron, he got back in quickly, rushed to contention, had speed into the turn then was used up.

Footnotes
GONNABEGOOD stalked the pace into the turn, rallied three wide to make the lead at the top of the stretch then finished full of run to win going away under
confident handling. DESTINY'S DARLING raced a wide trip and rallied five wide through the stretch to finish second best. BEAV'S BOO unhurried early,
finished with good courage between horses three wide. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE went evenly. PACIFIC COAST was hustled from the gate to gain a narrow
lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace along the inside into the stretch then was outfinished. SAVE THE FLAG passed tiring rivals. LOADED ONCE
MORE had good early speed along the inside then faded. CAUSE OF LOVE was no threat. BOX STEP was outrun. LADY PREACH pressed the pace two
wide into the stretch then faltered.
