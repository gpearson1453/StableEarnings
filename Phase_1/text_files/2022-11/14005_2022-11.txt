Footnotes
BRIDLEUPTOTHEBAR pressed the pace along the rail, took command on the turn, drew clear and held well. WESTPORT CAPTAIN was never far back,
rallied around the turn, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and closed to get up for place while no threat to the winner,. TEMPTED MISSION dueled to
the turn, fell back, offered a mild bid only and earned show. YOU'RE MY BOY KAT ducked in at the start to be off slowly, was taken outside and improved
position. BLUE PARADISE vied three across, fell back, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a late rally. BESAME MUCHO dueled to the
turn, dropped back and faded through the stretch. AMADMADWORLD was not a factor.

FULL VISION bumped at the start, was slow early, swung wide leaving the turn, closed willingly and wore down his rivals to get up late and won going away.
BOSS NINE pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, inched clear, led to deep stretch and was outclosed in a good effort. DEPUTY'S
DANCER advanced inside on the turn to challenge for the lead, dueled past the sixteenth pole, faltered and held for show. GODGUNSNCOUNTRY bumped
while getting away well, led to the turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. PICK A LANE FRANK broke awkwardly and was checked at the start,
raced inside and had no response. LIE AND DENY stumbled badly at the start, swung wide on the turn, went very wide in the stretch and was not urged.
THE THIRD RING stalked inside, was through early and stopped.

Footnotes
FIRECRACKER STAND vied past the eighth pole and drew off. WHOS DALLINS DADDY was hustled along, vied to mid stretch and was no match for the
winner. BAPTISM was never far back, went five wide entering the stretch and got up for show while no threat to the top two. DEVIL'S TEETH raced mid
pack, offered a mild bid only and was outnodded for show. STARZAN raced mid pack in an even effort and was not a threat. EPIC DRAMA raced inside,
lacked a stretch response and fell back. CREST DRIVE had brief speed only. KAT'S HITMAN was not a factor. CURRENTLY KRAZY was outrun.
CONQUEST MOONMAD failed to contend.
