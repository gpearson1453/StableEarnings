SPA CITY prompted the issue from along the inside, moved up to take a slight lead nearing the eighth pole, dueled with Fan Club from the point and proved
narrowly best in a prolonged drive. FAN CLUB saved ground setting the pressure pace, responded when challenged by Spa City, dueled for that point and
missed in a game effort. TWO BY TWO was allowed to settle in stride, rallied four-wide into the stretch and finished strongly while being unable to reach the
top two. CONTACT TRACING was forwardly placed while racing three-wide but lacked a rally. WHISKEY DOUBLE was unhurried early, rallied five-wide
into the stretch but was unable to sustain his best. GIROLAMO'S ATTACK chased the pace racing along the inside, gave way badly nearing the eighth pole,
was pulled late and walked off.

RIVER BOY was unhurried early, moved up strongly on the turn three-wide, angled out to be four-wide entering the stretch to take the lead, quickly drew
clear and was ridden out to increase his advantage. IRONSIDES saved ground while being reserved off he early pace, angled out two-wide for room
nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished strongly despite being unable to threaten the winner. PRINCE OF ROSES was forwardly placed while racing
three-wide, moved up to take the lead nearing the quarter pole and then flattened out during the drive. LED TASSO was unhurried early, came four-wide
into the stretch but lacked a rally. OUT OF ALCATRAZ was prominent early, raced four-wide throughout and failed to threaten. TALKSCHEAP prompted the
issue from along the inside for six furlongs and weakened. RANSAM PAYNTER set the pace racing in hand to near the quarter pole and gave way readily
when headed.

GIMME CANDY vied for the lead with Ship It, took the lead nearing the quarter pole and gradually drew clear. LANTERN'S CANDY stalked the pace racing
in hand, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole, could not reach the winner but continued on well in a steady effort. HAL'S DREAM was reserved off
the early pace while saving ground, angled out four-wide entering the stretch and was gaining slightly late. WICKED WONDER dropped back early, moved
up between horses on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. MONOCACY was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch
and failed to threaten. SHIP IT saved ground setting the pace racing in hand but came up empty when asked. INEEDAGIRLLIKEYOU raced in the middle of
the field while three-wide and was not a factor. INSPEIGHTFUL was forwardly placed for six furlongs while racing three-wide and then gave way.

Footnotes
DEEP STATE was unhurried after being bumped at the start by Mr Creed, then rallied six-wide into the stretch and was up in the final sixteenth to win going
away. COASTAL CHAOS was prominently placed while racing two-wide, split rivals during the drive and finished strongly. CONSPIRACY FACT stalked the
pace racing three-wide while being rank to place, moved up along the outside on the turn, drifted out entering the stretch and finished willingly when
straightened. BEYBLADER dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch, angled further out during the drive and gained his best stride too late. MR
CREED broke out to bump with Deep State, then was allowed to settle while racing between horses, came three-wide into the stretch to offer a bid and then
went evenly late. ONE COOL DUDE vied for the lead racing along the inside, took the after five furlongs, disputed the issue into the stretch and weakened.
ALEXIS N NIKO dropped back early while saving ground and failed to seriously threaten. FORT DEFIANCE was unhurried early, came five-wide into the
stretch and was not a factor. LORD CAPTAIN was forwardly placed to the stretch racing along the inside and tired. PAID IN FULL saved ground setting the
pace for five furlongs and gave way when headed.

MR. THUNDERSTRUCK was allowed to settle in stride, moved up between horses on the turn, angled out to come four-wide into the stretch, took the lead
leaving the eighth pole and won drawing clear. ONCOMING TRAIN was prominent from the start while racing three-wide, took the lead entering the stretch,
was unable to resist the winner but continued on well for the place. HOMETOWN HERO was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and finished in
a mild rally. TIGER MOON was unhurried early, came six-wide into the stretch, angled in during the drive and gained his best stride too late. NINETIES
COUNTRY was allowed to settle in stride, came three-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. EL FRANCO dropped backed early, came seven-wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten. TRIGGER HAPPY vied for the lead to near the stretch from along the inside and weakened. OUT WORK'N broke out, then
moved up to be forwardly placed while racing four-wide and tired. SPEED BOAT dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch and was not a factor.
ATRAS disputed the early pace from along the outside and tired.

Footnotes
SUE ELLEN MISHKIN saved ground setting the early pace in hand, responded to pressure when challenged entering the stretch and was hard ridden to
maintain a safe advantage. SOLID TUNE prompted the pace while racing two-wide, moved up to offer a bold bid between horses nearing the stretch, could
not get to the winner late but continued on gamely for the drive. SAINT EROS GIRL was forwardly place from the start, moved up strongly three-wide to
offer a bid, but was unable to stay with the top two late in a steady effort. WATERS OF MEROM was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and
was gaining slightly late. LEGERITY was allowed to settle in stride, moved up slightly on the turn, was three-wide entering the stretch but lacked the needed
late response. SHEZZ KOLDAZICE track the leaders while racing along the inside for a half mile and weakened. CANT BE TOUCHED ducked out sharply
at the start, then bobbled causing the rider to lose the irons, had her rider recover the irons nearing the five-eighths pole but was unable to recover the lost
ground.

SEAL BEACH forced the pace from along the inside, forged to the front to take the lead entering the stretch and maintained a safe advantage. ANGKOR
stalked the pace racing in hand, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole to offer his bid, could not reach the winner but finished well for the placed in a
steady effort. KUPUNA was unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and finished strongly. MILLIKEN dropped back early, came six-wide into the
stretch and gained his best stride too late. GULFSTREAM WAY was prominent early from along the inside, angled out on the turn, came four-wide into the
stretch but lacked a rally. DR. PERRY was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch, angled out further during the drive and passed tiring rivals.
CALL ME FAST was forwardly placed early while racing between horses and weakened during the drive. LEGENDARY LORE dropped backed early and
failed to seriously threaten. ZIPPIN GIGI saved ground setting the pace for a half mile and tired. SPARTAN ARMY settled in the middle of the pack and
lacked a response when asked. APPEAL DENIED dropped back early and was not a factor. MAC'S TIME gave way after showing brief speed from along
the outside.

PROXY stalked the pace racing in hand, drifted wide entering the stretch, caught West Will Power nearing the sixteenth pole and gradually wore that one
down. WEST WILL POWER saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged but wasn't quite good enough in a game try. FULSOME was
unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and finished fast. LAST SAMURAI was allowed to settle in stride, moved up between horses nearing the
three-eighths pole, offered a bid entering the stretch but was unable to sustain his rally. INJUNCTION was forwardly placed while racing three-wide but
lacked a rally. RICH STRIKE saved ground while being reserved off the pace but lacked a response when called upon.

ROYAL TAKE CHARGE saved ground setting the pace and maintained a safe advantage. SHADY ROAD prompted the pace racing along the outside,
could not get by the winner, but was clearly second best in a game effort. SWEET CURALINA was unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and was
gaining late. AWESOME ALLY VEE was reserved off the early pace, moved up to reach contention nearing the quarter pole while four-wide but lacked the
needed late response. MO HAPPY was in tight briefly at the start, then was allowed to settle, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. STAR
TABLE chased the leaders while while racing along the inside and weakened during the drive. BROADBAND dropped back early and was not a factor. OFF
THE CHARTS prompted the early pace while racing three-wide and tred. TWENTYTWENTY HOAX broke alertly and quickly opened a clear lead, then took
an awkward stride in the opening furlong and was quickly pulled up and vanned off following the race.
