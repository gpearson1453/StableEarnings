Footnotes
PREMIER WISH chased the dueling pacesetters from the three path through mid-turn, bid three wide nearing the quarter pole, gained the lead while
straightening then widened through the last eighth. DREAM STREAK vied for the lead two wide through the turn, was inching past the dueling challenger
into the lane when joined by the winner, had no answer for that one while staying on for the place spot. ONLY TIME vied for the lead along the inside
through the turn then weakened along the rail but remained well clear for the show spot. DIAL IT UP A NOTCH chased the top three through the turn and
into the lane, entered the stretch from the four path and lacked closing bid. MORNING LINE NEWS was in the two path through the turn, entered the lane
from the five path and never was a factor. LADY JEWELS made little impact while saving ground throughout. FRIEND raced in the three path through the
turn and steadily lost ground. GUEST IN MY HEART was in the three or four path through the turn and was always last.

Footnotes
SPACE FORCE WON chased the leader into the far turn while in the three path, bid two wide and in the three path into the lane then slowly put away the
runner-up. SPOKE set the pace on a clear lead into the far turn, was joined by the winner in late turn, dueled with that one into the lane then slowly gave
ground. SILENT SONATA saved ground through the turn and into the lane, came off the rail nearing the eighth pole then could not gain while far clear of the
rest. MILLION DOLLAR RED trailed while in the three or four path through the far turn, came into the lane from the four path and never was a threat.
DAAHER STREET was along the inside through the turns and never was a factor. GUARD chased the pace from the two path down the backstretch and
steadily faded. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE hesitated at the start and spotted the field over two lengths, raced in the four to the three path through the first
turn, continued off the rail into the far turn and tired.

pressed the pace in the two path, bore out entering the stretch, bothering a rival and couldn't match strides with the winner. EPIC THE LEGEND stalked the
pace in the five path, bid at the half-mile pole, then was checked entering the stretch. SHA KON O HEY raced in the six path. WHITE SILVER SANDS
bobbled the start, raced in the three path, then improved position late. PRESTO BENCH led inside before giving way in the stretch. JUST A NOTION raced
inside, bid at the three-eighths pole, then faded in the drive. PURSUANT hit the gate and was squeezed back at the start. RUNAWAY IMAGE stalked the

early, rallied three wide at the quarter pole, dueled late and was outfinished. SENORITA EMMA was bumped at the start, raced unrushed, and then had a
mild late bid for the show spot. CORSIDAT vied in the four path, bore out to the six path at the quarter pole and faded in the stretch. KISSES SO SWEET
bobbled the start, vied between foes, then gave way in the stretch. SAVEDBESTFORLAST was not a factor. ROCK OF CASHEL bumped a foe at the start,
was clear briefly, vied inside and gave way at the quarter pole.
