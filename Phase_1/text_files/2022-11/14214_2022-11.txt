Footnotes
MOONLIGHTNWINE had a mild hop leaving the break and was away a step slowly, came three wide along the first turn while tracking the pace, advanced
on the backstretch run, confronted LOOKSGOODONYOUTHO nearing the quarter marker, took a narrow edge on that rival into upper stretch, battled
against the game runner-up to deep stretch and kept to task in the final strides to prevail. LOOKSGOODONYOUTHO showed early speed and assumed
command leaving the break, was well rated through modest fractions to the half-mile marker, was confronted by MOONLIGHTNWINE nearing the quarter
marker, gamely battled the winner to deep stretch and was bested in the final strides, while well clear of the rest for second. LIBERTY WOLF was unhurried,
raced two wide along the backstretch run, improved position along the second turn, was no match for the top pair in the stretch run and kept on to be best of
the rest. SECRET SHAMBALA was not far back in the early going while saving ground, lost ground nearing the half-mile marker, tired along the second
turn, was a bit green in the lane and did not threaten late. MECHANT stalked the modest early pace, lost ground nearing the quarter marker, was outrun in
upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
MISS FLAWLESS (FR) raced three wide into the first turn, stalked the pace while advancing on the backstretch run, loomed along the second turn and vied
for the lead nearing the top of the lane, took a narrow edge to mid-stretch, shook free inside of the furlong marker, felt mild late pressure from the runner-up
and held safely in a drive at the end. CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) was allowed to settle, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run, was roused three
wide nearing the top of the lane, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed fast in the final sixteenth, mildly pressured MISS FLAWLESS in the final stages but could
not reel that one in and secured second. CLASS CODE assumed command leaving the break, set modest fractions through the backstretch run, was
confronted nearing the quarter marker, battled with MISS FLAWLESS to mid-stretch, could not keep pace in the late stages and was outfinished for place,
while well clear for show. NORTHERN ROSE was unhurried, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run, improved position on the second turn,
could not keep pace in upper stretch and lacked a late rally. ROSE PRINCESS settled off of the early pace, came in tight along the second turn when
GARDEES WORLD drifted while tiring, came four wide into the drive and gave way. GARDEES WORLD was forwardly placed in the early stages, attended
to the modest fractions through the backstretch run, gave way on the second turn and drifted out a path nearing the quarter marker, weakened in upper
stretch and tired in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
LIGHT UP was allowed to settle, raced two wide through the backstretch run, came in tight and lacked room nearing the quarter marker, split foes while
gaining ground nearing the furlong marker, overtook EXQUISITE LEGACY in deep stretch and powered home to determinedly prevail. EXQUISITE
LEGACY tracked the decent early pace from a two wide path, advanced on the second turn, vied for the lead in upper stretch then took command nearing
the furlong marker, could not hold off LIGHT UP in deep stretch and held safely for second in the final stages. FLIPLIT was unhurried, saved all of the
ground to the second turn, came in tight nearing the top of the lane, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and kept on to be an easy third. ROSEBUD RYDE
was hustled to contest the early lead, set solid early fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, held foes at bay through the second turn, was
confronted by EXQUISITE LEGACY in upper stretch, battled with that rival to the furlong grounds and gave way in the final sixteenth. MARANDO PASS was
asked for early speed and prompted the decent fractions through the backstretch run, kept close attendance to the pacesetter to the quarter marker, lost
ground nearing the furlong pole and tired late. LADY BLACKBIRD stalked the early pace while three wide, maintained position to the second turn, dropped
back nearing mid-stretch and faded in the final stages.

HARDLY MISCHIEVOUS showed early speed and contested the pace with her stablemate to the first turn, assumed command into the backstretch run and
was well rated through moderate fractions into the second turn, drew clear nearing the quarter marker, kept to task in upper stretch and pulled away late as
much the best. KOKO'S MOM was allowed to settle, maintained a two wide path into the second turn, was no match for the winner in the drive, was gaining
in the final sixteenth and was up for place in deep stretch. BIG ATTRACTION was away from the gate slowly and lagged in the early stages, saved ground
to the second turn, closed well in the late stages and was up for show in the final strides. FIRST POINT broke alertly and disputed the pace with HARDLY
MISCHIEVOUS into the first turn, took a stalking position into the backstretch run and raced in pursuit of her stablemate into the second turn, lost ground
nearing the top of the lane, weakened in the drive and was edged out in deep stretch for the minor awards.

Footnotes
HARBOR ABBEY broke sharply leaving the gate and was hard sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions while well rated through the backstretch run,
held foes at bay to the quarter marker, drew clear under hand urging nearing the furlong marker and kicked away in the late stages. BOLD ARTICLE stalked
the early pace from a ground saving position, advanced in upper stretch, was outkicked by HARBOR ABBEY in the final furlong and kept on in deep stretch
to be second best. ASHLEY'S RAINBOW was unhurried in the early going, maintained position to the second turn, waited for racing room nearing the top of
the lane, found an opening in upper stretch, finished evenly in the drive and was up for third in the final strides. DRESS REHEARSAL stalked the early pace
form a two wide path, raced in pursuit to the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, did not produce a late rally and was just edged for show in the final
strides. IDA CLAIRE was allowed to settle while never far back, raced three wide into the backstretch run, came four then five wide into the drive and lacked
a late response. CIELO DIAMANTE showed early speed and attended to the early pace, maintained position while three wide into the far turn, came four
wide for the drive, dropped back in mid-stretch and tired.

Footnotes
KODIACTION was allowed to settle, was well positioned while two wide into the backstretch run, raced two wide into the second turn, mounted a four wide
bid in upper stretch, ran evenly to the furlong grounds, closed with a rush in deep stretch, matched strides with AMERICA GREAT in the final stages and
surged in the final jump to earn the nod. AMERICA GREAT stalked the early pace from the inside, maintained position while saving all of the ground to the
second turn, ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed fast inside of the final sixteenth, took a narrow lead in the final strides and was nailed on the line for the
win. ANITANEWMERCEDES was hustled leaving the break and assumed command into the first turn, set prompted fractions through the backstretch run,
was confronted by LI MU BAI nearing the quarter marker, battled with that rival to mid-stretch, was all out in deep stretch, could not hold off the closing top
pair in the final strides and held for third in the end. LI MU BAI (IRE) showed early speed, attended to the moderate early fractions, made a steady advance
on the pacesetter and challenged for the lead nearing the quarter marker, battled with ANITANEWMERCEDES to mid-stretch, gamely battled to deep
stretch but could not hold off oncoming rivals in the final stages and weakened. TABLE FOR TEN was unhurried in the early going, raced two wide along the
first turn, came three wide into the second turn, swung four wide for the drive and closed willingly in the final sixteenth. SHOT OF A LIFETIME was allowed
to settled, saved ground while never far back, was steered two wide nearing the quarter marker, chased to mid-stretch and lacked a late response. CHIEF
WILD EAGLE stalked the moderate fractions from the second flight, raced two wide into the backstretch run, maintained position to the second turn, came
three wide into the drive and did not offer a late rally.

early lead leaving the break, set decent fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, was confronted by RIP CITY nearing the quarter marker,
repelled that effort and was set down for the drive, drifted out a bit to leave the rail open in upper stretch, was confronted by LAMMAS and met that bid to
the furlong marker but could not match strides with the winner in the final stages and held for second. FREEPORT JOE was unhurried in the early stages
while not far back, advanced nearing the half-mile marker, made a four wide bid leaving the quarter marker, came within aim in mid-stretch, was outkicked in
the final stages and was clear for third in the end. RIP CITY showed early speed, kept close attendance to I'MGONNABESOMEBODY through decent early
fractions, advanced on the second turn to vie for the lead, lost ground nearing the furlong marker and weakened in the final sixteenth. TULSA TORNADO
stalked the early pace from a three wide path, maintained position while outside of rivals on the backstretch run, lost ground three wide on the second turn,
chased to mid-stretch and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
HIIS REINA broke alertly and showed good speed to establish the early advantage, set fast fractions while well handled to the quarter marker, shook free of
a pressing rival inside of the furlong marker, dug in in deep stretch over oncoming foes at held sway in the end. LADY'S SERMON tracked the pace to the
turn, advanced while three wide nearing the quarter marker, came within aim approaching mid-stretch, could not match strides with HIIS REINA in deep
stretch and held for second in the final strides. THE GREAT HAYNES chased the fast early pace, raced along the inside on the turn, angled out in upper
stretch, closed willingly in the final sixteenth and just missed for second in the final strides. GRAZEN IN THE SUN made a mild hop at the start then was
shuffled back and was off a step slowly, chased the fast early pace, gained ground along the inside on the turn, came in tight nearing the top of the lane, ran
evenly to mid-stretch and was outkicked in the final stages. CRYSTAL PROOF was prominent in the early stages, pressed the fast pace to the quarter
marker, battled with HIIS REINA to mid-stretch, lost ground nearing the sixteenth-marker and weakened late. MISS MAIA lacked early speed, saved ground
to the top of the lane, was not able to threaten in deep stretch but came on in the final stages. SHEZARUNAWAY was shuffled back at the start, trailed while
chasing fast fractions to the quarter marker, swung three wide for the drive, finished well but was not a late factor. TWILIGHT EMPIRE bobbled at the start,
chased the fast early pace, raced two wide into the turn, swung four wide for the drive and lacked a late rally. EMMA'S DANCE chased the fast pace, gained
ground four wide on the turn, swung five wide for the drive and gave way. CALLMEMARTHAJANE chased from the second flight, raced five wide to the
quarter marker and did not factor in the stretch run.

Footnotes
MATCHLESS was one of the first into stride, tracked the PRETTY THIRSTY for the first quarter, moved to engage at the top of the stretch, dispatched that
rival passing the eighth pole and drew off under a brisk hand ride. MISS ACCELERATE raced mid-pack in the early stages while in the three path, launched
a bid from the three furlong marker and finished well from there to gain second. NIGHT CRUISER was hard ridden early, then content to track the early
leaders while saving ground, bid from the five sixteenths pole, got a clear run on the rail turning for home, stalled in the late stages but managed to gain
third. LEXCELLENT was outrun to the turn, stayed to the inside path through the turn, swung out for the stretch run and ran on but was not a threat to the
winner. PRETTY THIRSTY broke a step slowly, then was hard ridden to enjoin the early pace, seized a clear lead as his rider took a snug hold, was
challenged by MATCHLESS at the top of the stretch, responded when asked but tired in the final furlong. TAMA SETS DA PACE lacked any early speed,
made a little forward progress through the turn while racing four wide, swung out another path in the stretch but could not find the needed response late.
KATZIE BABY last away from the gate, was pressed hard to rejoin the pack while racing wide, made up a little ground through the turn while still wide but
flattened out in the stretch. FRANKLY ALL GOOD broke a little awkwardly, was mid-pack and between horses through the early stages, steadied slightly at
the head of the turn and then steadied hard past the five-sixteenths pole, never recovered and finished evenly. FREED BY MAGIC got away well, was hard
ridden to get forward position and was still under a drive when he started to fade passing the three-furlong pole, took up sharply when engulfed by the
chasing pack at the head of the stretch and ridden out. I'M GONNA SHINE lunged at the start and took a few strides to get straightened out, fell far behind
despite the best efforts of her rider and trailed throughout.
