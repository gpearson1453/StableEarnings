Footnotes
C C'S KINGDOM was situated in mid pack in the beginning, began to close in while well in hand midpoint on the turn racing three wide, pounced to the lead
five wide in upper stretch and cleared off in the final eighth to win comfortably. RACING IN THE RAIN stalked outside foes in the four path at the half, rallied
four wide three furlongs to the finish outside rivals, had a brief lead turning for home and could not find more to hold off the fast closing winner in the final
furlong. ADELAIDE COURT had a good spot tracking the engaging leaders down the backside, waited behind the frontrunners on the rail throughout the
turn, was steadied mildly at the top of the stretch, shifted inside to the fence at the eighth pole and closed well to just miss the place share at the wire.
KLIMTOGLORY was unhurried early to trail the field down the backstretch, angled out four wide at the quarter pole, shifted out more for clear run in the six
path at the eighth pole and showed good late energy to get up for a minor share. ROOKIE RADAR travelled four wide near the back of the pack three
furlongs remaining, offered a brief run three wide midpoint on the turn, angled out widest in the six path for the drive and passed tired runners through the
lane. MORNING THOUGHTS broke inwards at the start, tracked the contesting frontrunners three wide into the turn, was in with a chance behind the front
pack at the top of the lane, found a clear path at the furlong marker and could not quicken in deep stretch to threaten in the end. CITY LEGEND settled in
mid pack behind foes on the rail at the half mile marker, saved ground throughout the turn, raced three wide in upper stretch and could not make an impact
running to the finish line. PRIMORDIAL FEAR was brushed by his outside rival at the break, recovered to press the pace outside around the turn, was
headed while between runners turning for home and gave way in mid stretch to be a non factor at the finish. PASSTHEPUDDINPLEAZ battled inside for the
lead in the early stages of the race, was collared by outside rivals at the top of the lane and folded on the fence with an eighth left to run.

Footnotes
BET angled in early settling mid-pack near the rail, advanced inside foes midway on the far turn, shifted out at that juncture to come five wide past the
quarter pole, took aim in upper stretch, struck the lead outside the sixteenth pole and drew clear. I AM RESILIENT moved in from five to four wide mid-pack
and outside rivals on the first turn, advanced outside on the far turn, moved with and outside the eventual winner to come into upper stretch six deep, made
a mild bid in mid-stretch, was no match but second best. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE moved clear to set the tempo racing off the rail, was pressured up the
backstretch, shook clear of that rival but had no extra to fend off the top two but was best of the rest. HAYROLL moved forward in pursuit of the leader four
then three wide on the first turn, edged closer to apply pressure from outside about the five-eighths, weakened in the stretch but still preserved the minor
award. JMR PURE SENSATION broke outwardly and was in tight at the start, angled in early and was in a bit tight and had to tap on the brakes into the first
turn, moved out to race wider up the backstretch, went three to four deep advancing on the far turn, came into upper stretch five to six wide and kept on but
needed more. SOCIAL JUSTICE was lightly brushed at the start, shifted in and settled at the rear, encouraged along three then four wide on the far turn,
came into upper stretch six to seven deep and kept on. PERFECT PLAY rated in behind horses early about three wide, ran on evenly near inside in the
stretch. BODACIOUS BIZ was in a bit tight at the start, raced off the rail early toward the back, was encouraged along early up the backstretch, came out in
the stretch and was not a threat. LUCYS CHILD broke in just a bit, was forwardly-placed tracking inside, weakened. SUPER HEADLINE chased two to three
wide, steadily retreated. BAYTOWN ELVIS went three to four wide on the first turn, made an early advance outside four deep, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
CURE IN REACH pressed the lead inside early on, assumed command on the fence through the turn, was headed outside two furlongs to the finish, roused
on the fence in mid stretch, responded well to open up just enough at the sixteenth pole to hold in a photo at the wire. LAST DAWN had a good trip down
the backside tracking behind the contesting frontrunners inside, waited on the rail through the turn to make a move, finally found clear running room in mid
stretch and was full of run late only to run out of room at the finish line. TAKE CHARGE SOUSI travelled near the back of the field three wide down the
backside, stalked in the three path though the turn, offered a spirited rally five wide at the quarter marker, loomed boldly in upper stretch outside and stalled
the final sixteenth to settle for third in a three horse photo for the win. JACK settled in mid pack between foes at the half, was urged to go after the engaging
leaders midway on the turn, angled four wide at the top of the stretch and levelled off running to the finish line. AMBER LIGHT broke sharp to lead early on,
tracked the winner just outside three furlongs from the finish, took closer order to bid two wide at the quarter pole, had a brief lead at the top of the lane and
gave way between horses at the furlong marker. EDINBURGH CASTLE trailed the field down the backstretch, saved ground through the turn and could not
get involved for the drive to the wire.

Footnotes
HALLIE'S HERO moved up willingly inside under some restraint to press the pace racing just off the rail, took over at the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper
stretch and held safe from HONEY WON'T, who raced just off the leaders inside others but off the rail, moved out five wide turning for home, took aim, was
put to stout and steady urging and gained but was too little too late. BEN LOMOND shifted in up the backstretch, saved some ground two to three wide on
the turn just off the leaders, moved out six wide turning for home, secured show. ENJOY THE MUSIC appeared to clip heels and stumble just after the start,
settled off the pace, fanned nine wide into the stretch, gained but too late. DOT'S VISION was up close three to four wide early, lost ground into the turn,
kept on evenly thereafter. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS switched off the rail early racing toward the back, angled in once in upper stretch and improved position
inside. ANALYZER set the early pace racing off the rail, battled outside a foe two to three wide late on the turn, weakened in the stretch. SUIGU STAR
raced off the pace early, went four then five wide on the turn, ran on evenly and made no bid. READY HERO was outpaced racing inside early, came out
turning for home then moved out further in upper stretch, failed to menace. BAY OF RUM raced between foes three to four wide on the turn, was never near
enough to threaten. GOLDMINE CAT saved ground near inside to no avail.

Footnotes
MAAKWA took control from the start, continued to dictate the pace running on the turn, was urged on the fence nearing the eighth pole, opened up on the
challenger with a sixteenth remaining and held safe winning comfortably at the end. GIANT TEDDY chased the winner down the backstretch on the fence,
waited inside behind the frontrunner throughout the turn, shifted just outside in the two path at the top of the lane to have dead aim and could not gain
through the stretch. POSEIDON STEEL trailed the field in the early stages of the race, was asked for more run three wide at the quarter pole, angled out
widest in the seven path in upper stretch and closed well on this track outside to be a solid third. HICKSY stalked outside four wide outside foes with a half
mile left to run, was in range racing four wide two furlongs to the prize, shifted out to be in the six path for the stretch drive and raced evenly the final furlong
to settle on the fringes. FOUR ACES HIGH tracked three wide in the beginning, pressed just outside midpoint on the turn, was roused at the top of the
stretch and gave way between runners in the four path at the sixteenth pole. THREEFIFTYSEVEN settled midfield inside at the half mile marker, saved
ground on the rail through the turn, tried to rally up the fence turning for home and was one paced running to the finish line. SOUPER CLASSY travelled in
the middle of the field three wide down the backside, put in a brief rally commencing at the three furlong marker to be in the mix five wide in upper stretch
and weakened at the furlong marker. GALVASTON was shuffled back nearing the five furlong marker racing between rivals, two furlongs from the wire was
ridden hard to keep pace and could not make an impression the final eighth to the wire.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT ARKLE moved forward inside to press the pace, took a narrow lead at the half, edged away on the turn racing just off the rail, faced a challenger
turning for home, turned back that rival and kicked clear then held safe. STAR SCHOLAR angled in early settling off the pace, saved ground inside on the
turn, came out three to four deep past the furlong marker, got up for place over outside foes. DIXIE'S FLATTER was urged lightly at the break, tracked in
behind through the turn, came out three to four wide turning for home making a mild bid and asked for more, was turned back, fought on from between
runners late but only maintained show honors. KILLARY stalked the pace going three to four wide into the turn, came out six wide for the drive, kept on from
between runners late but was outkicked. PINK GELATO was in tight after the break, stalked from outside four to five wide, was seven wide in upper stretch
and outside foes fighting for the minor awards but needed more. AGILE DANCER raced off the pace, went five wide into the turn coming out seven wide for
the drive, ran on evenly. NOTHINGTOSEEHERE broke a step slowly, raced off the rail, was never a threat. HE'S GOT SOUL was never a threat racing off
the inside. HE'S FULLY LOADED set the early pace from off the inside, faded, was eased through the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
STREGA took command to have a short lead just outside entering the first turn, cleared to set the pace running down the backstretch, continued to set the
fractions on the final turn, was headed outside in upper stretch and dug in stubbornly the final eighth to edge away nearing the wire. TOTALLY IN CHARGE
pressed inside for the lead into the first turn, was reined back to track on the fence at the half mile marker, shifted just outside two furlongs from the prize to
bid in upper stretch, battled outside through the lane for the top spot and gave way in a hard fought effort with a final sixteenth to run. MY GIRL SKY saved
ground running on the rail, tracked inside mid pack down the backside, was urged midpoint on the second turn, had to take hold at the quarter pole racing
behind a fading runner, shifted inwards slightly for the drive and showed a good late run when clear to be a unchallenged third. TALK TO YA LATER stalked
near the back of the pack into the first turn, closed the gap on the leaders with a half mile remaining, was under a drive between rivals three wide at the
quarter pole and finished up evenly in the stretch to get up for a minor role. PLEASURE'S GOLD hopped at the break to be near the rear in the early stages,
made an early move four wide three furlongs from the finish line, loomed in the four path at the top of the stretch and faltered while widest of runners at the
furlong marker. DIXIE MORNING trailed the field in the early stages, took closer order to be in range into the far turn, saved ground racing two furlongs out
and offered little effort running on the fence in the stretch drive. WELL ACTUALLY tracked behind the contesting pacesetters the first quarter, continued to
sit just off the speed winner down the backside, was ridden to keep pace midpoint on the far turn between runners, had little response and retreated at the
quarter pole.

Footnotes
FULL SCREEN was in tight passing the wire the first turn in behind, tracked from inside near but just off the rail about mid-pack, moved out three wide in
behind rivals leaving the far turn, lacked room in behind so moved back in after passing a tiring foe, bid inside rivals past the sixteenth pole and got up late
over HUNT MASTER, who moved forward to press the pace from outside about three wide, took the lead past the quarter pole, led till challenged nearing
the sixteenth by both inside and outside rivals, was outfinished for the win but fought on to get the nod for place. BOSSY HOLIDAY switched outside a rival
early heading to the first turn, raced about three wide, put to urging by the five-sixteenths and moved out from three to five wide on that far turn, made a
steady bid from mid-stretch but was outfinished and missed the nod for second. LAC MACAZA stalked up close four wide, asked for run about the midpoint
of the far turn while in range outside and just off the leader, had no late kick. DISSECTOLOGIST steadied when in tight on the rail past the one-mile marker
and was under a tight hold at least a sixteenth thereafter while racing inside, moved off the fence, steadied on heels slightly yet again about the half,
continued to race off the rail, failed to menace. GIANT ONE set the pace racing off the rail, weakened once headed.

Footnotes
LILLZ HOPE hesitated at the start spotting the field several lengths, began to pick off rivals one by one midway on the turn, was full of run behind a wall of
horses at the top of the lane, dived between runners at the sixteenths pole and exploded on through in deep stretch to draw away to an eye catching win.
SILENT CREEK kept in range of the leaders eyeing the frontrunners on the turn, pounced to the lead five wide at the top of the lane and raced stubbornly
through to the wire to hold for place besting the rest in the end. STOLE THE RING tracked inside watching the pacesetters battle up front on the turn, was in
contention while shifting out six wide in upper stretch but needed more at the furlong marker to threaten for the top two placings at the finish line. SMART
IRENE settled on the rail in the early stages middle of the pack, advanced nicely inside running on the turn, dipped to the rail at the eighth pole and was
gaining late to garner a small share. WANNA PLAY was situated in midfield between horses with a half left to run, sat behind the dueling trio two furlongs
from home and finished up with some run eight wide late for a minor placing. MIMI'S HOLIDAY travelled near the back after the start, made an early move
to get a better position three wide three furlongs to the wire, shifted outside to be nine wide for the stretch run and kept trying to the finish to be involved for
a minor share in the end. OUR STORMY SOPHIA forced the pace scenario just outside at the half, assumed the lead midway on the turn, was surrounded
by challengers three sixteenths from the line and weakened in deep stretch. BRIENNE OF TARTH stalked in the middle of the field at the half, tried to
advance up the fence in upper stretch in tight quarters and was steadied on the rail at the furlong marker and could not recover in time to be a threat at the
finish. BEST BANK SHOT settled near the rear in the beginning, could not get involved running on the turn to trail at the top of the stretch and passed leg
weary stragglers through the lane. PICK A PENNY stalked near the back of the pack in the early stages, was roused and offered a mild run two furlongs to
the finish to be in the mix for a share, angled out widest for the drive in the ten path at the top of the lane and stalled outside at the furlong marker. DAISY
DANGLES pressed the early pace on the rail at the half, sat just behind the dueling frontrunners midpoint on the turn, gave way inside at the top of the lane
and retreated in mid stretch. MISS SCHILLER took command just off the fence running down the backstretch, was collared outside five sixteenths
remaining, battled on between foes until mid stretch and stopped the final sixteenth.
