Footnotes
LITTLE LARA pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled through the stretch and held off the late charge of YANKEE DOLLAR. YANKEE
DOLLAR raced close to the pace between horses, closed steadily and was outnodded to just miss. BARBIE WARS was unhurried early, bid inside on the
turn to get within striking distance, hung late and settled for show. MIZHIPZLETUS was hustled along to set a pressured pace, dueled in the stretch and
faltered near the sixteenth pole to lose position. PRINCESS OF MALIBU stalked the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, had little left and dropped
back. LUCY K was steadied entering the first turn, saved ground and lacked a bid. MUCH ABOUT ONE showed good early speed, tired entering the turn,
was eased and walked off.

far back, had nothing left for the drive and faded. OLYMPIC EXPRESS raced inside and had brief speed only. Hand timed.

SO MUCH HAPPY dueled inside, drew off on the turn for a clear lead and held safely while kept to task. AMARETTO DI AMORE was never far back, rallied
on the turn, closed steadily and got up for place while no threat to the winner. WAIT A SEC got away well, dueled two wide to the turn, fell back and was all
out for show. SMILING THUNDER was void of early speed, trailed the field, found her best stride late and was gaining ground. INDY'S STAR raced mid
pack, lacked the needed late response and failed to menace. SEVEN SISTERS failed to threaten in an even effort. APPRECIABLE raced in the back, bid
along the rail on the turn and failed to rally. FIRE ESCAPE saved ground, showed speed to the turn and stopped.

LONELY PRIVATE set the pace, drew off into the stretch for a long lead and held safely while kept tno task. CANDY ZIP stalked the pace, angled out on the
second turn, bid willingly to narrow the gap and finished second best. UNLEASH THE BEAST stalked the pace, went five wide leaving the turn and lacked
the needed late rally. HI HO CHEERIO improved position in a steady effordt. BEDROCK saved ground, bid and came up empty. TIGER BY HIS TAIL failed
to threaten in an even effort. TAKE CHARGE DEPUTY had brief speed only. LOLLY EXPRESS was not a factor. ALLEVA broke awkwardly and outrun.

Footnotes
SPEEDY GIGI bumped at the start and led throughout in a driving finish. SPICY SOMMELIER was void of early speed, advanced inside on the turn, shifted
out and closed to earn place. KID CAT finished well in an outside trip and got up near the wire for show. WE ALL AGREE stalked the pace along the inside,
lacked a late response and fell back. WORKIN NINETOFIVE failed to menace in an even effort. TOTHEMOONANDBACK bumped at the start, chased the
pace, weakened in the drive and fell back. WAHASHA had brief speed only. KNOCKON was not a factor. APPOINTED STAR broke slowly and was outrun.
