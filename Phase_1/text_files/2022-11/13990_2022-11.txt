ENFORCER pursued the loose pacesetter, took over at the quarter pole and pulled away while geared down in final furlong. DUCK DUCKY GOOSE broke
slowest and raced far back then advanced inside for the place. FINNOGGINDUDE dropped back early then finished willingly to just gain the show. MY
SLICK NICK saved ground behind the pacesetters and flattened out. BROTHERFROMANOTHER sprinted away down the backstretch, was collared at the
quarter pole then proved empty. POWER OF AQUARIUS dropped back outside and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
STONEGATE stalked the dueling leaders, bid on the final turn then drew off through the final furlong while kept to a drive. MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU
stumbled badly at the break, angled out rallying on the final turn but proved no match for the winner. NORTHERN EXPRESS alternated for the advantage
outside then came up empty in the stretch. STEVIE T trailed for half a mile then passed rivals along the inside. EPIC LUCK raced off the leaders in the two
path and lacked a solid rally. FIFTY SHEAS OFGREY earned a narrow lead inside then stopped after half a mile. MISCHIEVOUS JONES dropped back
early and raced far back throughout. LOUIE'S LAW was urged within striking range three wide and gave way readily.

Footnotes
CRAFTY JACK set the pace on the inside, responded when roused, pulled away in the stretch and was kept to the task. DRENA'S BULLET stalked the
pacesetter, chased on the turn, dug in gamely, failed to threaten the winner and was clear for the place spot. THEY SHOT SONNY raced off the pace,
advanced two wide on the turn, finished evenly in the stretch drive and earned the show. CAPE MAY STYLE raced off the pace inside, advanced on the turn
and then lacked a rally. WEEKEND IN COURT was off slowly, outrun early, advanced on the turn and did not factor. STRAWBERRY RED tracked on the
inside, then chased and faded. KOWBOY KARMA dropped far back early.

Footnotes
CLASSY SADIE saved ground close up, angled out in the stretch then wore down the pacesetter late. OUTLINE hustled to a clear lead inside then
weakened in the final furlong and was nailed nearing the wire. QUEEN CORDELIA angled inside rallying on the turn then offered a gradual late gain.
HALLIGIRL prompted the pace outside, moved wider in the stretch and flattened out. RISEN CHANGE dropped far behind then passed tiring rivals. MISS
ALEX urged just off the leaders wide down the backstretch and faded. GET HER READYEDDIE ran off with her rider aboard during the warm-up then was
always outrun. LADY BERNADETTE hustled within range three wide to the turn and gave way.

ABSENTEE saved ground throughout, faded on the final turn despite urging then came again through the stretch to get up in time. JACOHARE led early,
dueled between rivals and continued gamely to the finish. AFFABLE MONARCH advanced three wide after half a mile, circled into the stretch and gained
late. VISUAL ARTIST dueled along the inside, led narrowly in midstretch but was outfinished. SMARTEN UP lacked speed, angled inside then showed
some late energy. OLYMPIC ROMP raced off the leaders in the two path and flattened out. BOLD VICTORY lagged far behind throughout and caught a
stopping rival. JELLY NOUGAT prompted the pace in hand three wide to the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
UNCLE ERNIE set the pace on the inside racing with a clear lead, responded when roused in upper stretch, drew off and was kept to the task. TWISTED
RIDE chased close up early on the inside, made a bid at the quarter pole, dug in gamely in the stretch run and clearly second best. FIVE DREAMS chased
two wide, chased on the turn, finished evenly and held well for third. MARKET MAVEN raced off the pace inside, chased on the turn and had no rally. ROB
THE RICH raced two wide off the pace and failed to threaten. HIBACHI raced off the pace with an inside trip and did not factor. THE SICARII had his head
turned sideways prior to the start, then broke in air, off slowly, outrun early, moved up four wide on the turn and did not factor.

Footnotes
SMOOTH B dueled outside, repelled challenges and edged clear in midstretch then remained safe under steady encouragement. FAST BOB trailed far
behind, split rivals rallying in the stretch and closed with a rush too late. DONTMESAWITHME lacked speed, advanced inside and finished strongly.
ARTHUR'S HOPE dropped back after the opening quarter, moved wide and rallied nicely while no threat. FINAL SHOT prompted the pace between rivals to
the stretch and weakened. VIOLENT TURBULENCE forced the leaders along the inside and was finished after half a mile. ADMIRAL ABE hustled to a
narrow advantage for half a mile then faltered in the lane. SPITTIN IMAGE wide early, angled inside on the turn and lacked a rally. MARVALOUS MIKE was
urged close up outside to midway on the turn and gave way.
