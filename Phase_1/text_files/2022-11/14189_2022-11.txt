Footnotes
LITTLE FIRE settled near the rear in the beginning, trailed the field into the turn, began to rally three wide outside rivals three furlongs from the finish, angled
out widest in the six path for the drive and found her best stride late to collar the leader in the final sixteenth and inch away late. LOADED SECRET tracked
the early speed runner racing down the backside, assumed command outside at the quarter pole, fought on in mid stretch but needed more late and was
caught nearing the finish line. LUNATICA stalked outside four deep at the half, advanced on the turn around rivals three wide, loomed in the five path
turning for home and ran evenly the final furlong to hold for the show award. ORIGINAL ME had a good spot tracking the leader inside running through the
turn, lacked room trying to shift out two furlongs from the prize, was steadied in upper stretch and regrouped late to finish up getting a minor share.
BLUEYED PRINCESS travelled at the back of the pack in the beginning, took closer order inside entering the turn, waited behind rivals three eighths to go,
slipped up the rail at the top of the stretch and could not gain the last eighth. HALO STYLE settled in the middle of the pack three wide between runners in
the early stages, was roused five sixteenths from the line to be in the hunt four wide turning for home and faltered in mid stretch. BABY DRIVER was eager
early to lead them all down the backstretch, collared outside at the quarter marker, gave way between foes at the top of the lane and retreated the final
furlong.

Footnotes
SPEED CHESS moved forward and shifted in early to set the pace racing off the rail and clipping in behind with a rival when cutting over, moved clear at the
five-sixteenths travelling two to three wide, drew off under encouragement in upper stretch and was kept to the task. MEETING AT MARTHAS pressed the
winner from inside, could not kick on with that one, was headed for second in mid- to late-stretch but fought back late to get the nod over T'PRING, who
clipped heels and bobbled in the early going, raced four to five wide outside on the turn, came out a bit further for the drive, was outfinished for second.
AQUA LUNA settled off the pace, swung seven wide into the stretch, kicked on with mild late interest. HUSHEMUP broke inwardly just a bit, tracked in
behind, went three to four wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. SHE'S SO COLD raced off the inside through the turn while trailing, passed tired
foes. PRETTY SENSATIONAL was in tight early, went two to three wide on the turn, had no rally. IRON PRINCESS broke a step slowly, moved forward
inside, failed to menace. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL AS OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF T'PRING AGAINST SPEED CHESS
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACE DTHIRD BEHIND THE FORMER.

Footnotes
GREEN GABLES broke sharp to take control at the start, opened up on the field throughout the turn, had a clear advantage turning for home and cruised to
the line unchallenged while being kept to the task late. LETS RUN TWO tracked the engaging leaders at the half, saved ground inside racing on the turn,
rallied up the fence turning for home and offered a good finish the be second best. INSPECTOR RELOAD was unhurried early to trail the field, angled out
six wide for the stretch run and closed with good intent to finish well getting up for the show award. DEVIL IN HER HEART stalked near the rear three wide
entering the turn, offered a brief run at the quarter pole to be in for a share at the top of the stretch and levelled out at the furlong marker. SNEAKY REBEL
pressed the frontrunner briefly outside at the half mile marker, chased the loose winner on the turn and stalled in the final eighth between foes losing
positions. GOLD FORESTER settled in mid pack between runners in the beginning, was ridden the keep pace with rivals on either side five sixteenths from
home, lost her path in mid stretch and faded to be a non factor in the end.

Footnotes
BLAZING SKY stalked the pace, went four then five wide on the turn, struck the lead outside the eighth pole and kicked clear under urging. HENRY'S
GAMBLE switched off the inside just after the break, moved closer in behind the leaders three to four wide on the turn, moved out six wide in upper stretch
for room and was clearly second best but no match for the winner. WINYAH BAY tracked along the rail, got up for show inside a runner late. WAR
EMPRESS moved forward inside to the lead after the opening quarter racing just off the rail, was overtaken in upper stretch, needed more late. OHEAVENS
stumbled badly at the start and was outpaced early trailing while racing near the inside, came out a bit in the stretch and improved position inside rivals.
LINCOLNVILLE BEACH broke awkwardly, switched out and advanced outside runners to the turn, went six then seven wide on that bend, lacked the
needed late kick. VESPOLINA settled off the pace near the inside, moved out shifting seven wide into the stretch, ran on evenly. PIPESTONE was up close
racing five then six wide on the turn and asked for more past the five-sixteenths, failed to rally. BORN TO BE GOOD raced off the pace outside a runner,
moved out from three to six wide on the turn, failed to menace. BODACIOUS MISS had the lead early racing off the inside, attended from outside a new
leader past the five-eighths, regained command at the seven-sixteenths, was still in contention three to four wide on the turn but came up empty in the
stretch.

Footnotes
I'LL TAKE THE GOLD had a good tracking trip down the backstretch, moved outside midpoint on the turn to challenge for the lead, took command at the
quarter pole and kept on late to hold the closer at bay in the final eighth. D'S SOUL chased the frontrunning leader on the rail in the early stages, shifted out
four wide for the drive to bid for the top spot and was gaining through the stretch but it was not enough in the last sixteenth to threaten the winner at the
wire. NICE COMPANY broke sharp to lead early, set the fractions running on the turn, was collared by the winner at the top of the stretch and just held on to
be a non threatening third in the end. FIVE DAYS IN MAY was allowed to settle early trailing the field, three eighths remaining was urged for more, began to
rally four wide between runners in upper stretch and offered a good finish just missing getting up for third. PIERIAN travelled mid pack three wide at the half,
shifted inside behind rivals through the turn, rallied two furlongs out to be in with a chance six wide at the top of the lane and faded with an eighth left to run.
ELEANOR POWELL was situated inside near the rear in the beginning, running on the fence through the turn was nudged along, could not get involved at
the top of the lane and made little impact down the stretch. ANITA GRIGIO settled in midfield four wide down the backstretch, raced outside three wide of
runners on the turn, could not keep pace with horses two furlongs from the finish and was not a factor in the drive to the line.

Footnotes
SOUPER DORMY tracked from inside, bid inside foes taking the lead in upper stretch, quickly moved clear, held safe under steady handling. READY FOR
A FIGHT was mildly coaxed at the start and briefly among and between the early leaders, steadily dropped back, swung six wide into the stretch and rallied
too late. CASH DIVIDEND shifted in, saved ground near the inside, rallied up the rail in the stretch to be best of the rest. THERE'S NO JOE moved forward
to take the lead after the opening furlong, was clear at the half setting the pace from just off the rail, drifted out in mid-stretch while weakening. SHEKKY
SHEBAZ stalked from outside going four wide on the turn, exchanged a bump with a rival at the top of the stretch, switched out and ran on. SPITE STORE
attended the early pace, continued the pursuit three wide on the turn, exchanged a bump at the top of the stretch, failed to rally.

Footnotes
CLEOMENES waited near the back on the fence with three furlongs remaining, found room to shift outside at the quarter pole to be five wide for the stretch
drive, was full of run in mid stretch and was pulling away at the wire for the victory. UMNEYAAT tracked on the fence behind the pressing front pair three
eighths from the finish, began to rally shifting three wide off the tiring leaders at the top of the stretch, was game between foes with an eighth left and ran on
well to be a clear second. MAKES SENSE TO ME challenged on the rail for the front racing throughout the turn, was headed by multiple foes outside at the
eighth pole, fought on stubbornly on the fence in deep stretch, gave way to the top two finishers with a sixteenths left and determinedly held on for the show
money. KNOW HOW (GB) had a good spot tracking just outside the dueling frontrunners on the turn, shifted out four wide to contend in upper stretch, could
not quicken enough with rivals at the furlong marker and had to settle on the fringes at the wire. KERICS BEAUTY trailed inside in the beginning, travelled
between horses in the third flight entering the turn, was ridden for more with five sixteenths left to go, offered little response and could only pass a tired
runner in deep stretch. FIRST ROUND PICK contested for the lead just outside under a good hold down the backside, continued to engage for the front on
the turn, was collared running between rivals at the furlong marker and tired the final sixteenth. KEEP IT NEAT settled three wide outside foes at the rear
running into the turn, could not get interested two furlongs from the prize and made little impression through the lane.

Footnotes
LOAD ABROAD moved forward to set the pace, raced mostly just off the rail, turned back challengers and held sway under steady handling. SIMPLE
SOUVENIR lacked early speed despite urging, went five wide on the turn, moved out a bit for the drive, rallied too late. ROSE RING raced mid-pack
between runners three wide into the turn, improved position inside rivals late. TOUCH OF ROUGE settled off the pace shifting in, entered the turn two wide,
moved out four wide coming past the quarter pole, fanned further to be seven to eight deep in upper stretch, gained steadily but needed more. STORMY
SUZIE raced off the pace outside a rival moving out from three to five wide on the turn, fanned eight to nine deep, showed moderate late interest.
GORMLEY GIRL angled in early, saved ground on the turn, ran on mildly inside. AIRY FAIRY advanced three to four wide on the leader looming a threat at
the top of the stretch but could not sustain the effort. SHUDDACUDDAWUDDA shifted in early, saved ground on the turn, angled nine wide turning for home
and ran on. ROYAL CITY REIGN tracked from inside on then just off the rail, came out a bit more at the top of the stretch, faltered and faded. TAPITURE
WAY moved forward outside four to five wide on the turn, faltered in the lane. SPEAK ENGLISH chased from between runners, dropped back and faded.
