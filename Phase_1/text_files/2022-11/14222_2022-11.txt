Footnotes
PRETTY PRINCESS rated inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain, shook clear, then drew
off and was kept to the task. GOLD MAKER sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, shook loose of the
challenger, then was no match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. MAGICGIRL allowed to settle, looped two and three wide through the turn, came
widest into the stretch and closed well for the show. MISS MIAMI well placed and inside, angled out into the turn, moved to a striking position on the two
path, bid three wide outside the leader, then could not stay with that one, weakened and held a share. TEN PIN ALLY well placed and outside, held position
three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and had no rally. SWEET MOOCHIE was no factor, inside.

Footnotes
EL SAMURO set the early pace inside, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, dueled through the lane, came again late, edged ahead and
held. INDIAN BUZZ vied for the early lead on the outside, moved up and edged ahead through the second turn, dueled with the winner through the lane and
lacked the needed late kick. KOBLA MAS allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, fanned widest into the stretch, then closed well to gain the
show. SEVENTY SEVENTYCAT never far back, lost some ground three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and passed
tiring rivals. EXCHEQUER well placed and outside, held position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, then drifted in and faded.
CENTERFOLDPROSPECT tracked the pace and faded through the second turn.

Footnotes
INTER MIAMI sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, feeling pressure from the outside, dueled and
exchanged bumps with IMPERIAL KING, then came again late, edged ahead and held. MACHISMO well placed and outside, gained a striking position three
wide through the turn, bid on that path outside the leader, edged ahead into the stretch, drifting in and was outfinished. IMPERIAL KING well placed and
between, angled in into the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, dueled with the winner, exchanging bumps with that one and weakened.
HIDE THE DEMON passed tiring rivals. MOTO MOTO unhurried, looped two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, faded and
was vanned off. JUPITER BLUES stalked the pace inside and faded through the turn. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND A CLAIM OF FOUL RESULTED IN
NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

TWO STEPPIN KLUKI tracked the pace well back, angled out and moved up three wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch, made a steady
gain and drove clear late. BALISTICO well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain
and edged up for the place in the final strides. GREAT BRITAIN vied for the early lead from between, held position on the two path through the turn, bid
outside the leader into the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick and was outfinished for the place. NOVGOROD THE GREAT set the pace on the inside,
stayed on when challenged through the turn, came again and edged ahead in the lane, then weakened late and held a share. SAVVY LAYLA unhurried,
saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled in and lost his path, then angled out loosing his path, angled back in
and could not gain. JUSTICE WARRIOR ran evenly. SAVAGE was no factor. PUTMAN well placed and outside, edged ahead three wide through the turn,
then faded in the stretch.
