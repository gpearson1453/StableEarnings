Footnotes
LOOMS BOLDLY was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action in the two path around the turn, responded well
when asked for his best in upper stretch and held under strong urging. LIFETIME OF CHANCE chased the pace down the backstretch, went two to three
wide around the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner to the wire and finished with good courage to clearly secure the place.
BUSTINO SANTINO was bumped at the start then forced into another foe, checked while pinched back between horses, spotted the front many lengths,
moved out under urging at the rear, went four then five wide while well behind through the turn, came six wide into the stretch, gained while remaining on his
inside lead into the final furlong and improved position for the show in a good effort. DISARMED was hustled from the start then chased the pace, saved
ground on the turn, came off the rail into upper stretch and weakened. WHAT'S UP BRO was fractious in the gate, bumped with a rival while off slow,
moved up then tossed his head while green into the kickback at the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path then
moved further out and came up empty. DESTIN'S MISSION chased the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn and tired. WHISKEY
AND WINE broke in and bumped with a foe while off slow, moved up while inside of a rival, went three to four wide on the turn and had nothing left.
HELICOPTER MONEY lost his footing at the start and was one of four horses off slow, moved up on the outside, went four wide on the turn, spun five wide
into the stretch and faltered then was reported to have bled.

Footnotes
HEALING got brushed at the start by PIONEER SPIRIT when coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide through the first turn before chasing four then
three wide, came under coaxing near the quarter pole issuing a challenge for the front, swung four wide into upper stretch, seized command straightened
away, dug in edging clear inside the eighth pole, then dug in under lone threat to the outside and held on to prevail. BOLD VICTORY coaxed from the start,
chased five then four wide under prolonged coaxing from the half mile pole, swung five wide for home, dug in under a drive steadily gaining on the leader
through to the finish but it proved not enough when rebuffed to the wire. PIONEER SPIRIT broke out at the start brushing HEALING, raced three then two
wide latched on the leader to the outside applying some pressure, took over command with seven-sixteenths to go and came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three wide for home under threat to the outside, yielded command straightened away and weakened in the final furlong. SUPER
WICKED CHARM just off the inside early on, tipped out three then four wide through the first turn before chasing six then five wide down the backstretch,
tucked to the two path placed to coaxing half a mile from home, continued under a long drive five wide into upper stretch and tired. IT'S MANDATORY
coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from PIONEER SPIRIT to the outside, tucked inside half a mile from
home and yielded the front at the seven-sixteenths, faded and went just off the inside into upper stretch faltering, then got eased through to the finish.

Footnotes
AMUNDSON was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked while inside on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, was
put to a right-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths, extended the advantage into the final furlong and held under steady urging. NOVA RAGS was hustled
from the gate, established position just off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, shifted three wide near the quarter-pole, altered in over heels
at the three-sixteenths, was roused for his best shortly thereafter, rallied in the final furlong and finished with good energy but was too late while clear for the
place. STAGE LEFT brushed with a rival at the start, was forced out near the nine-sixteenths, went four wide on the turn and lacked the needed response
while able to get the show. SENBEI was hustled from the start, raced inside of a foe early, was put to strong encouragement nearing the five-eighths then
angled out at the nine-sixteenths, chased three wide around the turn, dropped back while remaining on his inside lead in the stretch and capitulated.
PIRATE RICK brushed with a rival at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the turn, chased into the stretch and came up
empty. FLAMINGO HAWK broke a bit awkwardly, dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path
and was outrun.

and drew away under strong urging. FOREVER WICKED bumped soundly with a rival while off a step slow, moved in early then dropped well behind the
rest of the field, saved ground around the turn and improved for the place. AL'S PRINCE moved out leaving the chute, settled off the pace, was urged along
passing the half-mile pole, went three then four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while able to get the
show. TOP OF THE MINT followed the leader on the outside, made a bid outside the half-mile pole, vied in the four path around the turn, dropped to the
three path under urging outside the quarter-pole, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch and weakened. WILL E SUTTON moved out then was coaxed
along on the outside, went four to five wide on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and came up empty. SPECTATORLESS bumped soundly with a foe
while off a step slow, was hustled up between rivals to take the lead then moved clear, was challenged outside the half-mile pole, lost the lead while two to
