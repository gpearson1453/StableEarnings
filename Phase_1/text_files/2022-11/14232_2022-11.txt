Footnotes
LOVE IS AWESOME settled off the pace while racing four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, took over nearing the eighth pole, quickly cleared and
held safe late. PRINCIPIA raced off the pace two wide between, angled four wide turning for home and rallied outside. FIA FIRST saved ground off the
pace, tipped two wide turning for home and was along for the show. COSETTA bumped with TESTED POSITIVE at the start, raced five wide in midpack
and lacked the needed rally. SISTER'S DUTY sprinted clear early, set the pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired. TESTED
POSITIVE was bumped at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. LADY PETAL chased the pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the
lane and came up empty. I LOVE IRELAND chased the pace three wide and retreated through the lane. MIVIC was outrun inside. SELF BANKING broke
very slowly and was always far back inside.

RAIN stalked the leading duo from the four path, was cued to bid three wide around the turn, took over while shifting inside entering the stretch, and opened
up. REAL DOOZIE broke out at the start, set the pace from the four path, lost the lead around the turn, was roused from the four path into the stretch,
finished evenly but held on to place. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE prompted the pace from the two path, fell back around the turn, was ridden from the five path
into the stretch, but was one paced and hust held on to show. LOVIN LIVIN trailed along the inside into the stretch and was no factor. RUTABAGA had to
steady at the start, chased from the five path but was no menace.

Footnotes
NEW YORK THUNDER set the pace in the two path, was cued to open up while floating out to the four path turning into the stretch, and was much the best.
CUTIE prompted the pace from the three path, was ridden along while drifting inside entering the lane, and kept on to secure place honors. BIRTHDAY
MUNNINGS stalked the pace in the five path, was coaxed turning into the stretch, but evened out for show. BERNARDO'S LEGACY tracked the pace from
the four path, shifted in to the three path entering the lane, but was one paced. EL ORO (FR) had a slow start and was hustled along from the three path
early, swung out to the six path going into the stretch, but was no factor. LOOKIN' SUPER chased the pace from inside, was on the wrong lead early around
the the turn, was corrected and roused turning into the stretch, but faded. DONTKISSDAMINISTER trailed from the inside early and never threatened.
ADORIAN raced from wellback along the inside and was done early.

DESERT RULER stalked the pace in the two path, was roused to bid turning into the stretch, and drew clear in the final furlong. I'M A G SIX broke slow and
was held up from the five path early, took aim from three wide turning into the stretch, and chased home the winner to place. ASSERTIKO set the pace
along the inside, was coaxed from the two path going into the stretch, but yielded in the final furlong to finish with show honors. MIGHTY TOUGH trailed
from inside early, cut the corner going into the stretch, but flattened. KING RAMOS broke in and bumped an inner rival at the start, chased while three wide
but was no factor. HARD BELLE tracked the pace while four wide, checked and appeared to clip heels early around the turn, was eased, and walked off.
SMILING TEUFLES got bumped by an outer rival leaving the gate, recovered to prompt the pace while two wide, was pulled up early around the far turn,
and walked off. AN INQUIRY WAS HELD TO LOOK AT ACTIONS EARLY AROUND THE TURN, NO CHANGES WERE MADE.

Footnotes
LOCO ABARRIO was bumped at the start, dueled between foes down the backstretch, dueled outside of MARLEY LUCK around the turn, came in under
right-handed urging and brushed that foe in upper stretch, dueled outside to the wire, brushed again nearing the wire and narrowly prevailed. MARLEY
LUCK broke outwardly and bumped TAPIT'S DIRECTION into COMMANDER FLYNN into LOCO ABARRIO into MY EAGLE SOARS, recovered to duel
inside of foes in the two path, was brushed and pushed into the rail in upper stretch, dueled inside LOCO ABARRIO throughout the stretch was brushed
again by that foe late and just missed in a game try. MR. AMERICAN tracked the pace four and five wide around the turn, lugged in under right-handed
urging nearing the eighth pole, angled back out soon after and gained the show. COMMANDER FLYNN was bumped soon after the start, raced four wide
and improved position in the lane. MY EAGLE SOARS was bumped soon after the start, raced off the pace three wide and never threatened. HELLO
SUCKER had early speed inside and steadily faded. SMOOTH RICO dueled outside of the top two finishers for three furlongs, angled in near the quarter
pole and retreated through the lane. ROCK CHALK was outrun while racing two wide. TAPIT'S DIRECTION was bumped at the start, steadied early, raced
two wide and trailed throughout. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF MARLEY LUCK, LOCO ABARRIO WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
MAMBA ON THREE stalked the pace from the three path, moved up to bid rounding the turn, was coaxed from the five path into the stretch, led into the
final furlong, and held on. FULL DISCLOSURE prompted the pace from inside, was ridden into the stretch, and dug in to hold on for place. CITY MISCHIEF
tracked the pace in the two path, was roused from three wide entering the stretch, drifted in slightly while passing the eighth pole, and kept on to get up for
show. BEE BY THE SEA bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the four path, loomed up around the turn and was cued to bid from the five path
turning into the stretch, but finished evenly. KING CAB bumped with an outer rival at the start, recovered to set the pace from the two path but faded in the
final furlong. ALEXIS S raced from behind in the three path early, was driven along while shifting out to the seven path in upper stretch, but was no factor.
BABY BOOMER rated along the inside but was never able to threaten.

Footnotes
HELL'S KITTEN dueled for the lead along the inside of a pair of rivals, was roused entering the lane, opened up slightly passing the eighth pole, and held
gamely. CAN'T BE BROKEN was held up in the four path, was ridden along while moving up three wide around the turn, floated out to the seven path going
into the stretch, and ran on for place. ETERNAL FLAME trailed in the four path, was coaxed while swinging out to the eight path turning into the lane, and
rallied down the center to get up for show. ROCK SOLID WORDS dueled for the lead while three wide, drifted out to the six path entering the stretch, and
evened out late. KNIGHTS BIRD rated in the two path, was cued between foes turning into the lane, but was one paced. CAJUN RED tracked in the three
path, moved up to make a bid turning into the stretch, but faded. CORPORATE AFFAIR broke well but had to steady along the inside early, stalked the pace
from said position but never threatened. SENOR GEE dueled for the lead between rivals but gaveway turning into the stretch.
