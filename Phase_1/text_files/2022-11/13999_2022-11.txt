Footnotes
NEVERFOLD rated with the early pace inside, challenged and took the nod at the three eighths pole, kept the edge over Mister Deeks from that point, drew
clear toward the quarter pole and was kept alert through the lane. BERNIE THE GAMBLER settled off the pace about the three path on the opening turn,
started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and dug in to take second inside the sixteenth pole. MISTER DEEKS closed
to the front while tapering in and rated a slim lead, was met a dueled from the three eighths pole, dropped back toward the quarter, gave up second inside
the sixteenth pole but held on for third. CRISTIANO BOY saved ground on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far
turn, angled to the four path toward the head of the lane and ran evenly in the lane. MONKEY WRENCH stalked from the three path the first turn, picked up
the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. QUIET JUSTICE saved ground on the first turn then faded through the
backstretch.

Footnotes
MISS COREY came away awkwardly then steadied and saved ground, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, steadily improved at the rail on
the far turn but angled out from the heels of SALTY SAUL and made contact with Sakari into the lane, dueled for the lead mid-stretch and widened later
yards. SALTY SAUL took the lead and moved to the inside past the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole,
rounded the far turn near the rail but was met mid-stretch and flattened stride. SAKARI rated off the pace inside, started a bid toward the three eighths pole,
raced off the rail on the turn, was bumped out leaving the turn but came back through the stretch and finished evenly. GRAM'S GAL settled off the early
pace about the three path, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the turn in the four path then flattened in the lane. FEEL THE GLORY
settled in the three and four paths the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole then flattened in the three path of the far turn. TOUGH
ONE steadied past the five eighths pole and settled off the pace, gave chase leaving the half mile pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. ULTIMATE
BREEZE saved ground. MOONLIGHT MISS rounded the opening turn about the six path and never factored. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against
the rider of Miss Corey for interference leaving the turn, lodged by the rider of Sakari, and disqualified the former to third place for interference leaving the
turn.

Footnotes
TOLLER angled to the inside and set a pressured pace, rounded the turn at the rail and was all out to hold off the stretch challenge of JOLLY HERETIC,
who pressured the pace and contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, dug in leaving the eighth pole but was turned back through the lane.
DINNER BELL chased through the backstretch, raced in the four path of the turn and ran evenly down the lane. FORGOTTEN MISSION gave chase inside,
ran at the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane. THEHEATOFTHENIGHT became a bit fractious just as the gates opened, was unprepared and leapt
at the start. DOESN'T MAKE CENTS leapt from the gate, gave chase outside then flattened in the three path of the turn.
