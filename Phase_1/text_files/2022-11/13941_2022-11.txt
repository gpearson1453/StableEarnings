VIRADIA settled perched four wide in closest aim of an early duel, remained on hold outside that top pair through the turn until set down swinging four wide
into upper stretch, took over command straightened away, inched away under a drive kept busy to the finish. DIVA BANKER five paths off the inside down
the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and ran on to secure the place
honors in the final jumps. MELTING SNOW got bumped at the start by AFLEET DIVA, chased just off the inside in aim early on before backing off a bit,
swung three then two wide into upper stretch let out for the drive, offered up a bid a furlong out, then dug in running on to the finish well clear of the rest for
the show honors. SHADOLAMO chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, improved position to
procure the last major share. DAILY BRIEFING chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch
and tired. SUMMER BREW bumped at the start by AFLEET DIVA, pressed the pace of that rival from the outside three wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths and taking narrow command near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, yielded the front straightened away and tired. AFLEET DIVA
broke out at the start bumping SUMMER BREW and ricocheted off that rival to bump MELTING SNOW all while under hustling, showed the way in hand

Footnotes
VACATION DANCE broke in at the start and was corrected but carried in BE OF COURAGE while forcing NO NAY HUDSON to shy in a bit as well, showed
the way from the three path in hand down the backstretch, tucked to the inside into the turn and remained patiently handled through the bend until let out
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat a furlong from home, inched away rebuffing the challenge inside the final sixteenth to
prevail safely at the end. NO NAY HUDSON (IRE) shied in at the start, tipped out to raced four paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and went three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
offering up a bid a furlong out, had the rider lose his grip on the left rein near the sixteenth marker while in the midst of being repelled and ran on safe for the
place honors. INFLATION NATION (IRE) tracked the front just off the inside from the tail of the compact field, came under coaxing along the inside at the
five-sixteenths, angled three wide for home and offered up a mild kick. CHIRINGO broke in hitting the near side stall at the start, chased four to five paths off
the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BE OF
COURAGE got carried in slightly at the start by VACATION DANCE who broke inwards, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened.

THE SLEEPYCHIPMUNK dueled in hand from the two path with ADDICTED TO YOU to his inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and was
roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive coming inwards under a right handed crop and bumped with ADDICTED TO YOU
just inside the eighth pole, then inched away to the finish to prevail at the end. TOGA DANCER tracked the pace along the inside, came under coaxing just
off the inside at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to just get up for the place honors in the final jump to
the wire. ADDICTED TO YOU dueled in hand along the inside of THE SLEEPYCHIPMUNK, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was bumped just inside the eighth pole as his main rival came inwards slightly, then kept on under a drive
shaken off in the late stages tipping out late and was just nailed for the place honors on the wire. YOUR MISSION tracked just off the inside until tipped out
three to four wide put to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. IMPAZIBLE PRINCE tracked the pace
just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no late headway. MAGIC TRUCK broke out
at the start bumping SENSE A GIANT and got bounced back inwards, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for
home and offered up late foot. SENSE A GIANT got bumped at the start by MAGIC TRUCK breaking outwards, chased three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and weakened. CENTRAL PRIDE chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung
four to five wide for home and offered no response. WHISKY WARRIOR chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out and tired. There was a
Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run as well as a claim of foul by the rider of ADDICTED TO YOU alleging interference against THE SLEEPYCHIPMUNK in
mid-stretch. After review, it was deemed that THE SLEEPYCHIPMUNK had interfered with ADDICTED TO YOU and as a result THE SLEEPYCHIPMUNK
was disqualified from victory and placed third prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
MOONAGE DAYDREAM showed the way in hand along the inside, got roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat a furlong out,
repelled the challenge a sixteenth from home, then inched away to the finish kept to task. REDIFINED veered out at the start and was corrected but
conceded two to three lengths to the front, chased two to three wide, angled out five wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, rallied to issue a
challenge a furlong out, got rebuffed a sixteenth from home and was shaken off while running on to preserve the place honors. GEORGEES SPIRIT tracked
the pace along the inside, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to secure the show honors. DONTLOOKBACKATALL
broke in at the start and was corrected, prompted the pace three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. DULCIA three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home
and weakened in the late going. RECINTO ROMPERE broke in at the start bumping HURRICANE DEBBIE and squeezing that foe back against and in
tandem with SHOWGIRL LYNNE B, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide for home and weakened in
the late stages. SHOWGIRL LYNNE B broke out at the start bumping and squeezing HURRICANE DEBBIE in concert with the aforementioned foe, chased
along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and weakened. HURRICANE DEBBIE stumbled awkwardly to the right
side at the start and was bumped solidly between foes who each broke her way getting squeezed back and taken in hand, bobbled when appearing to clip
one of those rivals in behind and conceded six to seven lengths to the front before being able to settle into stride, chased just off the inside detached at the
tail of the field, went four to five wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout having lost all chance at the start.

Footnotes
TIMBUKTU tracked the pace along the inside, got set down angled three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the sixteenth marker, then
edged away to the finish kept to task. SPETTRO led early on along the inside before conceding the front and tipping to the two path down the backstretch
settling in closest aim of that rival, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole and got roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch taking over
command, dug in under a drive under growing threat to the outside and was collared a sixteenth from home, ran on to preserve the place honors.
FIELDSTONE saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild
kick to secure the show honors. MASETA chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, weakened in
the late stages. FAST GORDON chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened.
HARD RYE GUY chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled eight wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. GINNSU
WARRIOR chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. BREADMAN chased
along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. BLESS BLESS saved ground near the
rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. GOOCH GO BRAGH just off the
inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and went eight to nine wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. PIVOTAL RUN
chased two to three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, weakened in the stretch. ABLETON forwardly placed three then
two wide through the first turn, tucked taking over command to show the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded
the front near the quarter pole and tired.
