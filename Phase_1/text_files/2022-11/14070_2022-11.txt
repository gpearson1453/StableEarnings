wore down his rivals to get up at the wire. BIG SCOTT DADDY set a pressured pace to the turn, drew off for a clear lead and was caught late. TEXAS
LONG BOW settled off the pace, bid inside, closed steadily and gained late. BIG ENDEAVOR pressed the pace, challenged between horses on the turn,
swung wide, fell back, came again and gained late. GLENROY bumped mildly at the start, trailed the field, offered a mild bid to narrow the gap but didn't
have enough late.

BANGIE GO was crowded after the start, raced close to the pace along the inside, angled out on the turn, swung wide, closed willingly, got up near the
sixteenth pole and inched away. BEYOND AWESOME was hustled along, veered out after the start, set the pace, drew off on the turn, was headed near the
sixteenth pole and yielded to finish second best. UNRIVALED QUEEN raced close to the pace, was carried out leaving the turn, fell back, went evenly late
and held safely for show. AMY D stalked the pace to the turn, tired and gave way. FIFTEEN HUNDRED showed little in an even effort. ILA VEIW TOO was
not a factor.

Footnotes
KALLINIKI sprinted clear to set the pace and held well in a driving finish. LADY PHYLLIS raced close to the pace, went six wide leaving the turn, bid
willingly, couldn't get by the winner and finished second best. STARS OF BLUEGRASS came in start, was unhurried and raced mid pack, rallied on the turn
to loom a threat, lacked the needed late response and settled for show. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY was slow early and closed well to narrow the gap. SILLY
NOTION failed to rally and did not threaten. LUCKY STEPPER was pushed in at the gap, lacked a bid and was outrun. MO CONNELLY settled off the pace,
rallied on the turn to threaten, had nothing left and faded. SHE'S MY RIDE came in at the start and was not a factor.

IMA TROUBLE MAKER rallied inside on the turn, angled out for the drive, got up near the sixteenth pole, drew clear and was all out at the wire. NO KITTEN
raced in the back, went widest in the drive, found her best stride late and was gaining fast. APRILINTHEPINES was slow early, bid inside on the turn, went
willingly to the wire and held for show. WRIGHT WINGED raced close to the pace, swung wide leaving the turn and closed well. BEAU ROCKS was void of
early speed, saved ground and finished well inside. WEDDING CHAPEL showed speed to the turn, dropped back and faded. MADIGAN SQUEEZE got
away well to set the pace, faltered near the sixteenth pole and lost position. BIGGER THAN YOU pressed the pace to the turn and stopped.

SONGOFTHEDESERT was never far back, put in a steady effort and failed to menace. REIGN OF FIRE raced mid pack in an even effort and was not a

Footnotes
DIRT FLIRT broke out, pressed the pace, took command entering the turn, drew off for a clear lead and held well. STREET SHADOW was crowded at the
start, raced in the back, went widest in the drive, closed well and was gaining ground. CINNTE WINNTE (IRE) stalked the pace, bid, hung late and held
safely for show. POETIC PURSUIT saved ground, bid inside and came up empty. EYES FOR GOLD broke out, set the pace, tired entering the turn and
faded. LADY NOGUEZ broke slowly, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. FOR LOVE NOT MONEY was outrun. PLUMA was steadied leaving the
chute, moved up to vie three across, tired on the turn and stopped.
