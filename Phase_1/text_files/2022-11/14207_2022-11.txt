Footnotes
LUNA LOCA coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, slipped away through the latter portion of the turn and was set down spinning
just off the inside into upper stretch, drew off under a drive, saw some of that margin cut into while holding clear to the finish. AMANDA'S FOLLY got
bumped between foes at the start, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to
secure the place honors along well clear of the rest. OUR ROSIE DIAMONDS bobbled at the break recovering outwards into SILEX and squeezing that rival
back against pressure coming from outside, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three to four wide into upper
stretch, weakened in the late stages while clear of the rest for the show honors. BERNT AGAIN hustled from the gate, chased three then two wide in closest
aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, faded through the latter portion of the turn and went four wide at the head of the stretch, then
weakened in the drive. DENIECE OF DEGRACE got bumped between foes at the start, chased three paths off the inside down the backstretch before
tucking along the inside through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and tired. DARKNSTORMY broke in at
the start bumping AMANDA'S FOLLY into the aforementioned foe against pressure coming out from OUR ROSIE DIAMONDS, chased four then three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and gave way. STRIKING MELODY chased three to four wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, made no impact. BRITNEY IS FREE chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,
continued along the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. SILEX got bumped solidly and was squeezed back at the start, chased greenly four then
three wide growing detached at the tail of the field, swung six wide into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish when trailing throughout. Please
note that STRIKING MELODY and OUR ROSIE DIAMONDS both ran for purse money only.

Footnotes
PATIENT CAPITAL had a shoe repaired in the paddock, settled off the early pace, moved out near the three-quarter pole then advanced to track the leader,
issued a challenge with a half-mile to run, vied in the three path around the turn, took the advantage at the quarter-pole then spun five wide, kicked clear in
upper stretch and drew away under steady urging. HOLEY MATRIMONY made light contact with a foe shortly after the start, raced up close down the
backstretch, was given his cue in the four path on the turn, chased into upper stretch, remained on his inside lead until the sixteenth-pole then swapped to
the proper lead and got up for the place. F F ROCKET went to the front, showed the way while well off the inside, was asked in the two path on the turn, lost
the lead to the winner at the quarter-pole and proved no match then lost the place while narrowly able to get the show. ROYAL TRYST broke out at the
start, was urged along off the pace, moved closer late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and just missed the trifecta. RELATE bobbled at the
start, was forwardly placed on the outside, chased in the five path around the turn and tired. BREADMAN checked sharply while pinched back between
horses soon after the start, dropped well behind the rest of the field, moved closer around the nine-sixteenths, went around the turn in the two path and
failed to threaten. SELL SOMETHING bumped lightly with a foe after the start, was urged along off the pace, dropped back in the three path on the turn and
faltered.

REGGAE MUSIC MAN was rated off the pace down the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, was given his cue outside the quarter-pole, rallied four
wide into the stretch, took the lead inside the three-sixteenths, drifted in closer to the runner-up outside the sixteenth-pole, fought with that foe to the wire
and just held under strong urging. LIFE CHANGER settled off the pace, was roused while saving ground on the turn, shifted three wide at the quarter-pole
then dropped to the two path, chased under a drive into the final furlong, made a bid approaching the sixteenth-pole, fought inside of the winner while snug
against the rail to the wire and just missed while clear for the place. MANDATORY moved up with five furlongs to run, pressed the pace on the outside then
in the four path around the turn, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch, had the rider lose his crop outside
the furlong marker and weakened while clear for the show. UP TO THE MARK settled on the outside, was urged four then five wide around the turn, came
six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LUNI SIMA was hustled from the start then settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn, spun
three wide into the stretch and failed to respond. CATCHYASOON moved in while going clear early, was challenged on the outside with five furlongs to run,
vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole and faded.

Footnotes
BAT FLIP just off the inside tracking the leader in closest aim, remained patiently handled advancing on that foe midway on the far turn, got set down taking
narrow command spinning from the two path into upper stretch, inched clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held sway to the finish to prevail.
DANDY HANDYMAN just off the inside just off the pace, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing just outside the quarter pole before being
let out spinning from the two path at the head of the stretch, ran on willingly to chase the winner home and was just up for the place honors over a rival on
the wire. GENERAL JIM five then four wide into the first turn, raced three wide through that bend before settling three then two wide in mid pack, came
under coaxing nearing the quarter pole before being roused spinning three wide into upper stretch, ran on willing through to the finish to procure the show
honors. RAMBLIN' WRECK saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five then four wide into upper stretch
and offered up a mild kick. LIAR'S POKER tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. CALYCANTHUS unhurried, settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under encouragement with
five-sixteenths to run, angled three then two wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. NOBLE HUNTSMAN three wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch and made no headway. LET'S GO BIG BLUE four then three wide
into the first turn, tucked to the two path through that bend and tracked the front from mid pack, came under motivation near the five-sixteenths, angled five
wide at the top of the stretch and weakened. DR. SETTLE'S DREAM established the front just after the start and showed the way crossing to the two path
into the first turn before making his way to the fence into the backstretch safely clear, settled in hand along the inside coming under attendance to the
outside from BAT FLIP and was patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the five-sixteenths as the pressure of that rival intensified to the outside, got
headed for command and cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive backing away and tired.

Footnotes
GREELEY AND BEN was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved closer at the seven-sixteenths, gained to make a bid in upper stretch,
drifted out some near the sixteenth-pole and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. RUNNINSONOFAGUN settled on the outside, was roused five wide on
the turn, rallied into the final furlong, closed well to make a bid between horses near the sixteenth-pole, bumped with a rival late and just missed while
narrowly able to get the place. FACTOR IT IN settled on the inside of an opponent, was asked while three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the
stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong, drifted in some while making a bid near the sixteenth-pole, battled outside of three foes, bumped with the
runner-up late and just missed while narrowly able to get the show. JAXON TRAVELER was hustled from the start, showed speed then chased the pace,
moved out near the nine-sixteenths, went around the turn in the three path, gained to make a bid at the quarter-pole then took the lead in upper stretch, led
under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught and just missed the trifecta. SYNTHESIS angled in at the rear of the field, went around the turn in the
two path, moved out outside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. HAPPY FARM was hustled from the gate, chased the pace down the backstretch,
went four wide on the turn and tired. BEZOS was hustled to a clear lead then showed the way, rounded the turn in the two path under urging, lost the
advantage in upper stretch and gave way.

handled and uncontested until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, quickly edged clear to the eighth pole, then held clear to the finish kept to
task. HIGHEST HONORS tracked the pace along the inside from the pocket, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch,

procure the last major share. BALTHUS (IRE) hustled from the gate, settled two to three wide just off the pace, came under encouragement at the
five-sixteenths and angled four wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the stretch. BEACON HILL just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch let out for the drive, then offered no response. MOONEY LOVE (IRE) tracked along

no rally while passing some rivals to the wire. SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter
pole and swung two to three wide into upper stretch, then came up empty in the drive. SOLDIER RISING (GB) two to three wide in pursuit from near the
rear of the field, came under encouragement with five-sixteenths to go, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. TEMPLE two to three
wide in pursuit, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths remaining, angled out five wide into upper stretch and weakened. REIGNING SPIRIT saved ground at
the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch, made no impact. DYNADRIVE marooned five wide through

Footnotes
MARIACHI showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied inside to the two path around the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch,
responded well under the crop until outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a solid hand-ride to the wire while much the best. GENERAL BANKER
was urged along on the far outside, went six wide around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and improved to earn the place. FACTUALLY
CORRECT pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, dropped back into upper stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong
and weakened while able to get the show. CLEVER FOREVER was urged along well off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, was driven six wide
into the stretch and improved position. VICTORY MONEY bumped soundly with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, moved out near the
five-eighths, raced in the two path for most of the turn then dropped to the rail, cut the corner into the stretch and failed to threaten. DR. KRAFT broke in at
the start, was urged along off the pace, went five wide on the turn and failed to rally. MAMA'S GOLD broke in and bumped solidly with a foe, was urged
along off the pace, saved ground for most of the turn then moved to the two path and came up empty. OCTOBER BLISS was bumped on both sides at the
start then pinched back, saved ground towards the rear through the turn, moved out around the furlong marker and was no factor. ITSALLCOMINTOGETHA
was well placed down the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and came up empty. EAST COAST GIRL moved up then chased the pace on the
outside, went four wide on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and faltered.
