eighth pole then drove past and cleared. PROTECTED AREA set the pace from the two path through the turn and into the lane, continued to be clear into
the lane from the three path then could not hold the winner safe while well clear for the place spot. WHERE'S MOE was close up early, lost access to the
rail entering the turn then slowly gave ground along the inside. COPPER HARBOR raced in the two path through the turn and into the lane and moved up
while not a threat. PABLO'S SUN chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and tired. SMOOTH TALKING
MAN saved ground into the lane and was empty. Race was hand-timed due to a timer malfunction.

Footnotes
GOLD BUCKLE chased the pace into the far turn, continued to gain on the three rival duel in late turn, tipped into the four path for the drive, gained
momentum when straightened, caught the leader inside the eighth pole and quickly cleared. SHIPSHAPE vied for the lead with another down the
backstretch and through the turn, lost the lead straightening in the lane then stayed on well from the inside to re-claim the place spot late. BLUEMOON
JUSTICE chased the two rival duel into the far turn, bid three wide near the quarter pole, swept past and cleared for the lead while in the three or four path
then faltered badly inside the sixteenth pole. SHOBIZ STAR vied for the lead two wide through the far turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. BAD BOY
was in the four to the three path through the far turn and never was a factor. CAMPAIGN SPY chased the pace from the three path down the backstretch,
continued in the three path when asking for more and was done soon after mid-turn.

JOLLY TOMMY vied for the lead along the inside into the far turn, lost some ground into the lane then stayed on gamely to save the place spot while
yielding to the top one. BARTULIA chased the pacesetters from the three path through the turn and into the lane, bid into the lane, appeared a serious
threat inside the eighth pole but lacked the finishing response. VERSATILE raced in the two path through the turns, bid into the lane from between rivals,
looked menacing nearing the eighth pole but could not sustain. SELF RULE was under a drive from the gate while trailing the field, continued under
intermittent rousing down the backstretch and into the far turn and was ridden out to the wire.
