the inside, angled out in the stretch and was up for the place. FEARLESS FLY pursued the winner three wide and continued well to the finish. DRONE
SWARM lacked speed, moved closer outside before the half and had only a mild rally. MOUNTAIN TREE saved ground close up and proved empty in the

OUR UPTOWN GIRL broke a step slow, was well placed on the inside behind the dueling leaders, angled out, bid four wide midway on the turn, took
charge, responded when roused in upper stretch and drew clear under urging. SNAPPY RIDE stalked four wide early on, chased outside on the turn, came
four wide into the lane, rallied outside and was up late for second. LA REGALADA dueled between rivals in a three way tussle, dueled on the turn, dug in
gamely in the stretch drive and lost second late. GOD STILL LOVES ME dueled three wide for command, dueled on the turn and weakened. YELLOW
DRESS dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn and weakened in the lane. SMARTY PANTS SANDY raced off the pace, saved ground on the turn
and did not factor.
