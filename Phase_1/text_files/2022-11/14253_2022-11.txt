Footnotes
RUN ROCKY vied for the lead three wide, made the lead on the turn, shook clear under right handed urging and won under confident handling. DASH OF
FIRE with the second flight two wide, had a mild rally in the five path into the stretch and finished clear for second. TWINSPIREDJOEY prompted the pace
two wide into the stretch then was outfinished. MARVIN'S EXPRESS close up, dropped back on the turn, swung wide then finished evenly. GOING
PRIMETIME failed to menace. DAVIS HAT was no factor. CLASSIC VOLUME sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace into the turn then
weakened. MUCH TIMES TWO was no threat. JUST INSPIRED trailed.
