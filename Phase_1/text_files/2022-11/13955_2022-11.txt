MODUS OPERANDI (IRE) set the pace and turned back a bid leaving the turn and drew off in the drive to prove much the best. LIGHTNING ROD stalked
the winner throughout, made a bid on the turn but could not go with that rival while staying on for the place award. WEBB was allowed to settle early and
lacked the needed winning bid while besting the rest. MISSION BRIEF lacked a rally. EAGERLY failed to menace. CATCHER'S MITT failed to respond.
TALK OR LISTEN (IRE) stopped and left the course before the last fence, walked off.

SOUTH MOUNTAIN (IRE) was reserved early, advanced on the inside on the second circuit, then made an outside bid and closed determinedly to get up
late under a drive. QUID set a pressured pace early, then drew clear on the second circuit, then was headed over the last jump but dug in gamely but just
could not hold on, just missed. SEISMIC WAVE was well placed on the inside and weakened, bested rest. KIYOMORI stalked the pace on the outside and
tired. HILLIARD chased the pace on the outside and tired. PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL FIVE HORSES HESITATED FOR OVER TEN SECONDS BEFORE
GETTING INTO A GALLOP ACCOUNTING FOR THE SLOWER TIME OF THE RACE.

Footnotes
MOLLY FANTASY (GER) was allowed to settle early, made a bid on the far turn and kicked clear after the last jump to prove best, driving. NEW
APPOINTMENT (IRE) was void of early speed, then made a middle move to get into contention, made a bid on the turn and then could not go with the
winner late, second best. SPEED ALERT was reserved early and then finished well to gain the show award and best the rest. SAIGON was reserved early,
made a inside middle move to loom boldly but weakened late. OUR BAB (IRE) was allowed to settle early and lacked a solid rally. BELLA COOLA chased
the pace and tired. SORAMOND (GER) set the early pace and then ran off to a big lead and then stopped. EVE'S CITY tracked the early pace and then
stopped and was pulled up and walked off.

gave way. IRANISTAN was reserved early, made a middle move to be in contention then tired. ASK PADDINGTON (IRE) left the course after one circuit,
