and held well to be clear while racing near the rail under steady handling. ALEXIS'S STORM was off a step slow, chased the early pace from the outside of
foes, raced three wide through the far turn and finished gamely to the wire. CHICKIENESS showed good early foot while racing between rivals and
weakened a bit through the far turn. SKYLAR'S SISTER rated along early, waited near the five sixteenths pole, angled out, raced five deep into the upper
stretch and had no final bid. PHAROAHS BABY GYAL settled off the early pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and raced evenly with no final bid.
BEATIFUL KARLA was unhurried early on, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. GENIEINABRIDLE dropped back early, raced
along the inside around the far turn and never was a factor. MO CO GOLD was acting up, unprepared and hit gate at the start, lost a considerable amount
of ground at the break to race far back and crossed the wire with good energy. BOSSERATI showed good early speed to set the pace along the inside,
faltered and was eased the final eighth of a mile. A steward inquiry was filed to review the start of Mo Co Gold and no action was taken.
