MINE TO HOLD was well rated early and made a three to four wide bid on the turn to take over by the quarter pole, then drew out in the lane to prove much
the best, driving. THE ROBERT was settled early on the inside, eased out and made a four wide move on the turn, then was no match for the winner while
being second best. MIDNIGHT TRICK was reserved early, then was three wide on the turn and had a mid late rally to gain the show award. DEVIOUS MO
prompted the pace and made a two wide bid to take a short lead on the turn and weakened. GREY QUEST set the pace on the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
ONE LAST FLING was away alertly to set the pace on the inside, then drew off on the turn and then was getting tired late but lasted to prove best under left
handed crop urging. LEAPING FOR CANDY broke in at the start, advanced four wide on the turn, then closed willingly. LET'SGOSHAGDANCIN stalked the
early pace three wide, then chased the winner three wide on the turn, then ran on willingly to the wire but was outfinished for the place. HAZARD chased the
pace and was three wide on the turn and had no rally. RACE N RETURN was settled on the inside and had no rally. OUTERWEAR was slammed at the
start and was not a factor.
