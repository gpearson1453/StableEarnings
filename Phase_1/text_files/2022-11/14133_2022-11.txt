TIP SHEET never far back, dug in late four wide under left handed urging and was along in time. SAY HEY KID trailed into the stretch, circled his field five
wide and just missed getting up in time. KLAATU away alertly, set a pressured pace two wide until mid stretch then was outfinished. GEH SCHNELL
reluctant to load, was under strong restraint while pressing the pace along the inside into the stretch, gained a narrow advantage a furlong out and was
outfinished. GIO SAMMY pressed the pace three wide into the stretch and faded late. MAN DOWN within striking distance into the stretch, gave way.

OUT MY DEAR chased the pace into the stretch, dug in determinedly under right handed urging two wide and got up in the final strides. BAREFOOT
BEACH stalked the early pace, rallied inside rivals to make the lead nearing the top of the stretch, set the balance of the pace then couldn't handle the
winner. PRICEY APPEAL went evenly. PROPER ETIQUETTE away alertly, set the pace off the rail for a half then weakened. DISCREET ENERGY
unhurried early, moved up inside rivals on the turn then failed to sustain that bid. APPEALING SENORITA had good early speed then faded. EASTER
PRIDE was no threat. CLIFTONS BALLERINA bumped with MY PINK BABY BIRD at the start, settled mid pack and was through after a half. MY PINK
BABY BIRD was bumped at the start and had brief speed.
