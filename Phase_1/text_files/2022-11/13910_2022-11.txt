Footnotes
STRAWBERRY TREAT was settled early and three wide entering the turn, dropped to the inside leaving the five sixteenths, swung out four wide leaving the
turn and closed full of run to hit the front at the sixteenth marker and draw clear, driving. GRAND ESCAPE dueled for the lead on the inside and dug in
gamely in the drive and kept on for the place award. UPSTATE AND BACK was reserved early on the inside, angled out in the drive and finished well to
gain the show award late. RUN HAPPY PAPPY dueled for the lead and made a three wide bid on the turn but could not shake that rival, then faded late. I
ONCE STOOD ALONE was away alertly and broke outwardly, then stalked the pace two wide entering the turn, then was three wide on the turn and
weakened.

OVER AND THUNDER set the paced on the inside while clear, was well handled throughout, drew out leaving the turn and then drew off to prove much the
best while being ridden out the final furlong. DOUBLE TIME BAY was rated early on the inside, then shifted off the inside on the turn to mount a bid three
wide by the quarter pole, proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. SIMILAR TASTE was four wide into the first turn, made a three
wide middle move and tired. SCYNTZ chased the pace three wide and stopped.

WISH FOR PEACE was well rated along the inside, made a inside move on the turn, shook clear leaving the turn and then widened the margin to prove
best, driving. PIT BOSS was well rated three wide, made a four wide move on the turn to vie for command by the quarter pole, but flattened out, held place
award. SEICHE was allowed to settle, then was two wide on the turn in hand, swung out wide for the drive and finished well on the outside, got show award
and just missed the place spot. P JS SILVER DUKE pressed the early paced two to three wide, shuffled back on the turn, came five wide into the lane and
just missed the show award. MASON MANIA set a pressured pace along the inside, then was in the two path on the turn and faded in the drive. CRUSH IT
stalked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn but weakened in the lane.

NORTHERN THUNDER tracked the pace and made a four wide bid on the turn, then drifted and wandered by the furlong marker, then surged the final
sixteenth to get up late, driving. COLONEL MOORHEAD set a pressured pace along the inside, made a bid to shake clear leaving the turn, but could not
hold off the winner late, second best. HOT N SPICY LOVE was rated between horses, then saved ground on the turn, awaited room by the quarter pole
while blocked, slipped through leaving the turn but needed more. AXXERATOR was allowed to settle early, advanced on the turn and came five wide into
the lane but had no kick in the lane. TRIPLE A. PLUS pressed the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but weakened in the drive. THIS ILL
DEFEND was reserved early, advanced on the inside and swung out three wide for the drive but had no rally. A T M AWESOME was well placed along the
inside and tired.
