Footnotes
ARRIVEDERCI controlled the pace, repelled challenges, extended his advantage briefly in midstretch and remained clear under steady urging.
OUTRAGEOUS BET settled close up inside, faded briefly on the final then came again for the place. GRIT'N'GRIND lagged far behind, advanced wide in
the stretch then closed well too late. OPEN LENGTHS forced the pace outside then came up empty in the stretch. LONG GRAY LINE made a menacing
wide move on the final turn, loomed a stretch threat but flattened out. CURLIN'S THRILL dropped back inside and was always outrun.

Footnotes
EXPENSIVE CUT showed good early speed, set the pace in the two path, showed the way on the far turn, responded when roused, dug in gamely and held
well under urging. KODAPENDENT was outrun early, advanced on the turn, angled out, rallied and finished well outside. GUILLAUME tracked close up on
the rail, chased on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, closed mildly and got up for third. LEASE stalked close up outside, then pressed the pace, bid
two wide on the far turn, weakened and was outkicked for the show. IRISH HONOR raced off the pace inside and did not factor. SKILLFUL raced three wide
early, settled off the pace, was asked on the far turn and lacked a response.

Footnotes
LOOSE ENDS reserved inside, awaited room, split rivals rallying into the stretch and was just up in a tight finish. THISTLE chased close up between rivals,
angled out in the stretch and closed. BODE O set a pressured pace, repelled challenges and finished gamely just missing. BE ONBOARD raced close up
wide throughout and tired in the final furlong. BEACHWALKER trailed while not far behind then proved empty by the quarter pole. NATAVALLI'S KNIGHT
forced the pace in the two path under a rating hold then faltered. CRYO stumbled badly at the start unseating his rider.
