Footnotes
PINO IN A PURSE tracked in mid pack on the fence with a half remaining, advanced inside three furlongs from home, shifted out three wide to bid in upper
stretch, took command with an eighth left and was edging away for the win at the finish line. D'S SOUL chased the early speed inside in the beginning
stages, engaged the leader on the rail through the turn, disposed of her pace counterpart two furlongs to the wire, was headed by the winner at the eighth
pole and battled stubbornly to the line besting the rest in the end. ELEANOR POWELL settled near the rear four deep down the backside, circled around
foes four wide through the turn, loomed outside of horses turning for home and stalled at the furlong marker settling for a non threatening third at the wire.
MACHISIMA broke sharp outside to lead in the early stages, dueled outside through the turn, could not quicken with her fellow speed rival at the quarter
pole and was one paced running to the finish line. IVY'S STAR broke a bit slow at the start, was uninterested travelling down the backstretch trailing the
field, shifted out three wide for the stretch drive and passed tired runners in mid stretch. ANITA GRIGIO stalked three wide in the second flight racing into
the turn, was asked to keep pace with the leaders at the quarter pole, could not offer a response and made no impression running to the wire. SAVVY'S
SISTER chased the pace between rivals at the half mile marker, started to give way with rivals on either side three eighths to the finish and stopped on the
rail in upper stretch.

Footnotes
TARADAR moved clear and shifted in to dictate the tempo, was asked by upper stretch and drew away, was kept to the task late. JUST START ME UP was
lightly brushed at the break to no real consequence, moved forward to stalk the eventual winner two to three wide, asked for more past the five-sixteenths,
came into upper stretch four wide, was no match for the winner but just held the place over UNILATERAL, who was forced out at the start brushing lightly
with the aforementioned, settled at the rear racing near the inside, edged closer on the far turn, tipped out four wide coming to the quarter pole, moved out
further in upper- to mid-stretch, was gaining on the runner-up but just missed second. SIR GRAYVENSCROFT rated mid-pack inside, edged a bit closer on
the far turn, shifted six wide turning for home, ran on evenly. SPIRAL STORM shifted in and gained more forward position heading to the first turn, tracked
inside, steadily weakened in the stretch. QUIET REBEL raced outside about mid-pack early two to three wide, went three to four wide on the far turn, failed
to menace. BIG BROWN BREWSKII broke outwardly, pursued from outside a foe just off the leaders two to three wide, steadily retreated. SANTIAGO
SALSA moved out from two to four wide on the first turn at the rear, edged closer four wide heading to the far turn, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
EMICRACK (CHI) took control from the onset, relaxed kindly up front running on the turn, responded well when roused at the furlong marker and was kept
to the task late to win comfortably in the end. FORESTER'S TURN was slow into stride following the break, trailed the field on the turn when steadied briefly
inside at the seven sixteenths pole, rallied four wide at the top of the stretch, closed fastest down the lane but ran out room and settled for second best.
FIELDER pursued the winner throughout the turn, was coaxed to keep pace five sixteenths to the line, chased in vain turning for home and weakened late
losing place to the closer in deep stretch. RACE FOR PINKS was situated near the rear between rivals in the early stages, roused with runners around him
midpoint on the turn, battled between foes at the top of the stretch and finished evenly to be on the fringes. MALIBU SECRET stalked three wide near the
back in the beginning, offered a brief run three wide outside three furlongs from the finish, shifted out widest in the four path to be in the mix for a minor role
in upper stretch but needed more late to be involved the final eighth. CHECKERBOARD FLOOR was hustled early on the rail, could not keep inside position
midway down the backstretch, tracked on the fence behind the loose winner on the turn, urged for more run five sixteenths from the wire and stopped on the
fence at the furlong marker.

HYPERFOCUS settled off the pace outside runners four wide, continued four wide on the far turn while biding time, moved out six to seven wide in upper
stretch and put to a drive, struck the lead a sixteenth out and drove past. DANI'S VICTORY was bumped at the break, settled three wide toward the rear,
began to edge closer on the far turn, moved out five wide coming past the quarter pole, bid in mid-stretch taking the lead from about the eighth pole till
overtaken at the sixteenth pole and was second best. VELOCE shifted in to track in behind the leaders close up on or near the rail, came out a bit turning for
home but moved back in, made a mild bid inside but needed more. HALLIE'S HERO set a pressured pace inside on or just off the rail, was simply outkicked.
SAILOR'S PASSION angled in early while being taken back, saved some ground on the first turn on or just off the rail, moved out a bit on the far turn going
three to four wide on that bend, came out further in upper stretch and finished strongly but too late. CARMENOOTZ stalked in behind the leaders just off the
rail, advanced three then four wide on the far turn with a mild bid near the quarter pole, could not sustain the effort. GIANT CRITIC raced outside about
mid-pack four to five wide on the turns coming into upper stretch about nine wide, ran on evenly and made no bid. FOUR KNIGHTS settled inside, swung
out eight wide for the stretch, was never near enough to threaten. SOCIETY JOE bumped the outside rival at the start, was coaxed forward pursuing the
leaders in behind three wide, weakened. JEGOS FIRE moved forward outside, pressed the pace two to three wide, came up empty. TAOS (FR) was
encouraged along nearing the half-mile marker racing inside, failed to menace.

Footnotes
ORIGINAL ME tracked in a good spot behind the leaders under a snug hold at the half mile marker, waited behind the pacesetter through the far turn, shot
up the fence at the furlong marker to claim the lead and drew off nearing the wire. DUSTY'S CHANCE rated three wide midfield around the first turn, took
closer order between challengers with four furlongs remaining, was roused three wide at the quarter marker, loomed four wide in upper stretch and finished
up well to hold for second at the wire. DREAMINGOF JEANNIE settled near the back in the beginning stages on the rail, trailed the field at the half, had one
runner beat three sixteenths to the line racing five wide, weaved her way through traffic at the eighth pole and closed well just missing the place award in the
end. HUSHEMUP chased the frontrunner two off the fence down the backside, continued to pursue to leader on the far turn, took closer order to be in the
hunt at the top of the lane, bid three wide a furlong from the wire and faded in deep stretch to just hold for a minor share. ASHWICKEN stalked near the
back three wide into the first turn, offered a run three or four wide around rivals three furlongs from the finish, was in contention outside in the six path
turning for home and stalled the final eighth. IVICTORY was off slow at the start to trail early on, settled near the back just outside down the backstretch,
was asked for run at the quarter pole angling out six wide for the drive and showed some late energy to be involved for the minors at the finish. LEMON
DROP FOX saved ground in the early stages stalking in mid pack, was in range behind horses turning for home inside for a small share but levelled out on
the fence in deep stretch making little impact. BRIENNE OF TARTH took command into the first turn on the fence, continued to dictate the pace down the
backside, still was up front at the top of the lane, was collared in mid stretch and faltered in the final sixteenth.

out seven to eight deep leaving the turn, kicked on to get up for second over PRINCE SUSSEX, who settled just off the leaders racing about three wide into
the turn, moved out five wide late on that bend after being encouraged along past the five-sixteenths, bid and took a narrow lead in upper stretch, drifted out
just a bit, lacked the needed late kick. MYSTIC POINT was urged at the break to get forward position, dropped back between runners into and on the turn,
moved out from two to six wide late on that bend, shifted in past the eighth pole and ran on. I AM RESILIENT lacked early speed despite urging, trailed
while off the inside, swung eight to nine wide and ran on. WOOD BE WILD was urged forward to take the lead not long after the start, set the pace racing
about two to three deep, weakened in the stretch. BULLET SPEED was encouraged at the break, raced on or just off the rail toward the back and made no
late bid. ARQUEBUS stalked from outside, was within range four wide till the quarter pole, came up empty for the stretch.

Footnotes
SOONER LUNAR bobbled at the break to trail in the beginning, started to pick up runners outside three eighths from the line, elected to go inside at the
quarter pole, closed in the three path turning for home and wore down rivals at the wire for a hard earning victory. POSTURING settled outside stalking
midfield at the half mile marker, angled inside to the rail around the turn behind the contesting frontrunners, shifted just outside three sixteenths from home
and finished up gamely losing a heartbreaker right at the finish line. HALF TO RELOAD broke sharp to lead inside leaving the chute, was pressured outside
for the top spot down the backside, put that speed challenger away nearing the quarter pole to have a clear lead entering the stretch and weakened in the
final sixteenth settling for show. MIGHT BEE SPEEDY stalked inside mid pack down the backside, could not keep pace with challengers racing on the turn
and passed weary horses inside for the drive to the line. GEM QUALITY was in good position tracking outside the dueling frontrunners through the turn, had
to go five wide for the drive around a tired foe nearing the top of the lane, contended for a share of the prize in upper stretch and faltered at the eighth pole.
BOSS HOLIDAY pressed the pace scenario just outside in the two path early, gave way between rivals nearing the quarter marker and stopped outside in
upper stretch.

Footnotes
GOSPEL WAY stalked in behind near the inside, bid inside taking command at the top of the stretch, quickly moved clear and was kept to the task. BOX N
SCORE brushed lightly at the break, settled off the pace two to three wide, advanced three wide into the far turn moving out seven wide out of that bend,
showed good late stride to gain the place. CHANCEL stalked the pacesetter while kept very wide four deep early, moved forward to force the issue taking
the lead at the five-eighths and still off the inside, was overtaken and needed more but kept on to hold show honors. H C HOLIDAY brushed lightly with foes
at the start, raced mid-pack two to three wide on the first turn, advanced while moving out three to six wide on the far turn, kept on but missed show honors.
HELL BENT brushed with a rival lightly at the start and was then urged forward, gained on the leaders early up the backstretch three to four wide, lacked the
needed late kick. HIT THE POINT raced outside at the back three then five wide early, continued wide on the far turn moving nine deep into upper stretch,
improved position. AWESOMECREST shifted in, saved ground through both turns, ran on mildly. CREDIT RIVER shifted in early, saved ground racing near
the inside, failed to menace. OCTOBER FROST switched out early, went two then four wide early racing toward the back, continued well back two to three
wide on the far turn, failed to menace. SAME AGAIN DOC broke open the gate before the others and immediately went to the lead to set the early tempo
inside, was overtaken up the backstretch, chased the new leader from inside, came up empty. DOWNLOAD bobbled ever so slightly at the start, was
outpaced trailing inside, never got near enough to threaten. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY IT WAS DETERMINED SAME AGAIN DOC RECEIVED
AN UNFAIR START AND RAN FOR PURSE MONEY ONLY WITH WAGERS ON THIS HORSE REFUNDED.
