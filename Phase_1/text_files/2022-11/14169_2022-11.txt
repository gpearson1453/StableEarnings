ABSTRACT LILLY tracked in the four path, moved up around the turn, took the lead from the five path entering the lane, and held sway. I WIN LIKA GIRL
raced in midpack from the five path, ranged up to take aim between rivals going into the stretch, and ran from the six path for place.
COCKTAILWITHATWIST chased in the six path, was floated out to the eight path entering the lane and kept on to secure show. MS MERAZ set the pace
from inside but yielded at the top of the stretch. LA NUBE pressed from two wide early, began fading around the turn, drifted out very wide, and was no
menace. WINNING ATTITUDE broke slow and was always behind.
