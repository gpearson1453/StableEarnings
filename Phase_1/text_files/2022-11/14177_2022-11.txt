Footnotes
LILY'S TRUMPET a step slow through the turn came five wide in upper stretch surging in the closing yards arriving in time. PAYSTER away alertly set the
pace racing off the inside through the turn digging in from the three path down the lane being grabbed from the outside in the final yards. NO MORE went
evenly through the turn giving a mild rally in upper stretch pressing hard between horses at the wire. HE'S A FINE MAN stalked the pace saving ground to
upper stretch vying willingly the final eighth along the rail. IN THE GOSPEL pressed the pace through the turn then faded in upper stretch. TWO STEP
DANCE played no factor. VERRAZANO LEGACY faded on the turn. BISHI fractious in the gate slipped coming out. KING'S STORY folded up on the turn
easing in mid stretch.

Footnotes
YO YO MON stalked the pace through the turn looming outside of rivals in upper stretch using full extension three deep to prevail. VIVE EL MOMENTO
stalked the pace while in a bit close at the rail pressing through the turn then down the stretch vying gamely to the end. BIPARTISAN BROOKE hustled out
set the pace coming under pressure near the quarter pole dueling in upper stretch ceding late between horses. FREE TO RUN tracked the pace chasing a
dueling trio from the four path in upper stretch moving in range the final sixteenth lacking a final surge. TICKLISH slow early lagged through the turn racing
evenly in the three path down the lane. GO GET EM played no factor. GOLD PASS hustled along chased through the turn tiring in upper stretch. ESTA
CALIENTE was always outrun.
