Footnotes
BIRTHDAY TIME set the pace along the inner rail, opened up on the far turn and prevailed under brisk urging. SELF ASSURED lacked speed, raced inside
horses down the backstretch and into the far turn, swung five wide leaving the far turn and rallied outside riivals. LINN PIER raced near the inner rail,
chased the winner and lacked the needed rally. COMMANDER BUZZKILL (GB) saved ground, eased out to the three path in mid stretch and flattened out.
LUMINIST , three wide leaving the first turn, moved farther out entering the backstretch, advanced three deep mid way on the far turn and weakened. CALL
ME VIVIAN , four deep the far turn, weakened. AT THE GATE was not a factor. COFFEE BEAN chased the winner, raced in the two path between horses
on the far turn and weakened. I CAN DO IT , steadied near the five eighths pole, was done on the far turn.

Footnotes
PIT STOP MAN was sent up inside a quartet of rivals and contested the pace past the five eighths, shook clear around the turn, drifted out a bit near mid
stretch, was corrected with right handed asking and dug in tenaciously to prevail. LADNEEDSAHANDLER dueled on a slim lead between runners early,
ceded to the winner leaving the far turn, prompted that one past the five sixteenths, gave hard chase from the head of the lane and continued gamely while
saving the place. HIGHLAND DREAM rated behind rivals into the turn, came under pressure past the three eighths, angled out, came four wide for the drive
and closed nicely. SPRING THE BEAST broke a step slow, rushed up between runners soon after and contested the pace, rated back off the leaders into
the turn, saved ground into the stretch and kept on with interest. WHAT SAY YOU was steadied when in close soon after the break, regrouped then was
angled out when gathering steam mid turn, circled five wide into the stretch and rallied. WORLD OF FOOLS , sluggish early, saved ground into the stretch
and failed to menace. GOLDEN AVIEATOR , five deep with the pace nearing the half mile marker, dropped in some to pursued near the three eighths, failed
to keep pace soon into the lane and tired. FREE SQUARE , four wide and between foes while disputing the early pace, faltered mid turn and was eased
late.

time. SUE LOVES BARBADOS moved up in the four path to gain the lead near the eighth pole, drifted in slightly inside the eighth pole, drifted out a bit late
and flattened out. B DETERMINED trailed to mid stretch, was in the seven path near the eighth pole and rallied outside foes. BY THE SEY SHORE saved
ground around the turn, eased off the rail in upper stretch, checked lacking room in mid stretch and finished willingly. ETCHED IN STONE , in the five path
between horses in mid stretch, failed to sustain his move and steadied in narrow quarters near the sixteenth pole. PICKIN SEA GLASS bore out leaving the

the turn, steadied lacking room near the eighth pole. TENAX disputed the pace two wide and weakened in the drive. Objection by the rider of BY THE SEY

Footnotes
ORO DE MORO MORO angled out leaving the chute and tracked the dueling leaders, cruised up and bid three deep mid turn, took over and responded
when roused soon into the lane, opened up under strong asking in mid stretch and was kept to task. WONDER WATER saved ground, edged up leaving the
far turn and was put to a ride mid turn, angled three wide soon after, shifted further out with pursuit in upper stretch and kept on to give game chase to the
wire. UNDER THE RADAR broke a step slow, settled off the early pace, angled five wide under coaxing into the stretch but failed to seriously follow through
in the final furlong. ICY MINISTER , off the pace, saved ground in upper stretch, angled out and lacked a bid. FEDERAL OFFENSE got into a pace battle to
the inside of STORIED FELLA leaving the chute, carried that scrum into and around the turn, stayed on to about the three sixteenths then gave way.
STORIED FELLA , away alertly, dueled outside FEDERAL OFFENSE, fought on between runners heading to the lane then gave way in the final three
sixteenths.

Footnotes
SHACKINTHEBOX moved up to the inside B WEST leaving the five eighths and engaged that one for the lead, dueled under coaxing around the turn,
gained a slim advantage near the sixteenth pole, drifted out a bit late and proved resolute to the wire. B WEST , bumped at the break, sped to the front while
off the inside, was joined past the five furlong marker, sparred outside the winner from there, held a short lead in mid stretch, was floated out a bit late and
gave way grudgingly. ENERGY EFFICIENT , five wide early, chased four wide outside a rival around the turn and churned on through the drive. GENERAL
J R lagged far back, saved ground mid turn, swung out past the three sixteenths and finished willingly. BONDED chased towards the inside, angled out and
faded. INSPIRED IRISH bore out at the break and off slow, lagged back, angled out in the drive and kept on with some interest. SUPER ACCELERATE was
hustled up between runners early, gave hard chase to the inside of a rival, eased out nearing the lane and weakened. IT'S VIPER , rank at the break, was
steadied off heels leaving the far turn, angled wide and failed to threaten. LOVE TALK saved ground and had his rider lose the whip in upper stretch.
SILVER PATRON came out at the break and bumped soundly with B WEST, hustled up, chased in the clear heading to the turn and tired. DA BEERS ON
ICE dropped well back early, came four wide for the drive and lacked a bid. GREAT CALL flashed speed, faltered and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
TOM HAGEN set the pace along the inner rail, opened up on the far turn and was under urging in the drive. MR. SHADES OF GRAY , steadied leaving the
starting gate, swung to the five path in upper stretch and closed gamely. WISH ME HOME chased the winner, came well off the rail in upper stretch and
finished gamely. CRISPER , always well off the inner rail, was four deep turning for home and failed to be a menace. BOURBON CURRENCY , along the
inner rail the far turn, swung three wide in upper stretch and had a mild move to mid stretch. BATON , steadied in close quarters along the inner rail entering
the first turn, remained inside horses throughout and failed to rally. STRIKE THE TOP lacked speed and was not a factor. BELTWAY BOB lost ground on
the turns and weakened. CELTIC SEA hugged the inner rail on the far turn and faltered. SEARCH FOR TRUTH , outside horses down the backstretch,
chased the winner for six furlongs then faltered.

Footnotes
AMERICAN D'ORO , bumped from both sides at the break, regrouped and dropped in, edged up in hand nearing the turn and tracked the embattled
leaders, awaited room into the lane, got through along the rail past the three sixteenths, took over with a furlong to go, responded to an ask of the right stick
and eagerly pulled away while steadily hand ridden the final seventy yards. TREASURE TROVE hesitated at the break spotting the field multiple lengths,
rushed up to reach contention after a quarter mile, stalked the leaders then was under asking between rivals mid turn, steadied soon into the lane, angled
out a bit and came back on willingly to nab the place in the final jump. BENANDJOE accelerated to contention and dueled to the inside of PLOT THE DOTS,
carried that battle under urging past the three eighths, drifted off the rail when clearing soon into the lane, failed to contain the winner's charge in mid
stretch, had his rider relax for a few strides leaving the sixteenth pole then kept on willingly to the wire. LOCAL MOTIVE , four to five wide, ranged up under
a ride to loom in upper stretch, gave hard chase past mid stretch then was out kicked from there. PLOT THE DOTS sped to contention, dueled outside
BENANDJOE, stayed on to the three sixteenths then gave way. CORDMAKER lost ground five to six wide, made a mild run nearing the lane, failed to kick
on past the quarter pole and faded. FAMISHED , six wide outside foes heading to the turn, dropped in leaving the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
HOPE HE'S FAST sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, opened up entering the stretch and lasted under steady handling. BUBBA
CHROME lacked serious speed, saved ground around the turn, remained along the inner rail until easing out near the sixteenth pole and rallied gamely. ICE
CUBE BABY chased the pace outside the winner around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened. WESRIGHT broke slowly, was three wide on
the turn and passed tired foes. RASCALLY REBEL , outrun, raced in the two path on the turn, angled out and passed faders. DANNY'S WINKSTER
bobbled at the break, saved ground on the turn chasing the pace, swung out in upper stretch and gave way. MO EH HENNESSY stalked the pace, drifted
four wide leaving the turn and faltered. DOUBLE BID hugged the inner rail on the turn while outrun.
