brushing lightly with COMPASS CAY in upper stretch and gained ground to the wire to get up late. COMPASS CAY raced in the middle of the pack between
horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, brushed mildly with CAMPTOWN RACES at the top of the lane and dueled to the wire,
getting caught late. LIL BULL tracked the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, challenged from the three path coming around the
turn, dueled down the lane and gave way in the final strides. CHIEF CHARLIE hopped up leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the
three path around the turn and passed tiring horses in the lane. THEJIGISUP raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, continued
around the turn in the four path, offered a bid nearing the quarter pole and flattened out in the final furlong. TEDDY'S HONOR pressed the pace between
horses up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and faded in the stretch. UNCAPTURED LYON led the way on the inside through the

Footnotes
CINCO DINERO saved ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the rail coming around the second
bend, swung wide into the stretch, kicked clear and drew off in the final furlong. THE SWAYZE EXPRESS bumped with horses to either side leaving the
gate, settled well off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the three path and gained ground late. ZONAL
dueled from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path coming around the far turn, could not go with
the eventual winner in the stretch and weakened further in the final sixteenth of a mile. EASTON E bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, raced in
the three path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, improved position while racing in the three path around the far turn and never
threatened. PRALINE'S CAT bumped mildly with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, settled off the pace on the
inside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path, veered out sharply entering the stretch and was empty from there.

Footnotes
RUNAWAY TOM raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path approaching the quarter pole and kicked clear in the
final furlong. MY BROTHER MIKE raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, came around the turn in the five path, offered a bid coming off the
turn, dueled in upper stretch and chased on to the wire. MY BIG DRAMA chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the three path
around the turn and finished evenly. AIDINGANDABETTING dueled on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and
gave way in the lane. EL MIC TIESUN trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the five path around the turn, swung still wider entering the stretch and
never threatened threat. ABSOLUTIST raced at the back of the pack in the opening stages, began to improve position while racing in the two path around
the turn and flattened out in the lane. MINISTER QUINN dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn
and tired in the stretch. GOLDEN WONDER veered in sharply leaving the gate, clipping heels with MISTER FERNANDO in the process, recovered to stalk
the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and faded in the lane. MISTER FERNANDO clipped heels with
GOLDEN WONDER in the early strides, lost his rider and walked off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE START. NO CHANGES WERE
MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.
