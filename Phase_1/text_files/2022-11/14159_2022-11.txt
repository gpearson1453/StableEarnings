A P HUMOR was forwardly placed off the leaders then angled out on the turn to make a four wide rally and clear late to be up for the win. GYPSY
JACKPOT challenged for the lead from the inside through the turn and was able to hold on for the place. VALID BREAK dueled for the lead from five wide to
deep stretch and held on for the show. ROADSIDE GIRL hopped slightly at the start then battled from two wide to the final yards and gave way. AMELIES
DREAMER was within striking distance but weakened. IT'S TIME BABY was void of early speed and was never a factor. POLO'S TRIBUTE battled for the
early lead then dropped back on the turn and galloped home.

JOEY'S LIGHTENING was allowed to settle going around the first turn then steadily advanced down the backstretch then made a four wide rally in upper
stretch to draw clear in the final sixteenth. SILVER CHALICE was placed off the pace on the inside through the first turn and down the backstretch made a
three wide bid on the final turn to take the lead but lacked the late kick needed for the win. CASTLEBERRY tracked the leaders from two wide through the
final turn then made a mild bid in upper stretch to be up for the show. FLAT OUT FABIO was roused to go to the lead through the backstretch then was
headed in the middle of the final turn and gave way. ROYAL DE BE raced in the middle of the pace through the final turn then made a late bid but was not
enough late. UNCLE BRAD tracked the leaders from the inside but was not a factor. CUSTOM DANCER raced near the back and was not a threat. PAC
THE PULPIT saved ground to no avail. ELIJAH'S MOVE showed little. HONORABLESTATEMENT stalked the pace from two to three wide and retreated.

Footnotes
TIZ THE BIG ONE stalked the pace from the two path then took the lead at the quarter pole and drew off. FOUR O SIX CREED raced in the middle of the
pack from four wide to the final turn then made a rally but was no match for the winner. AARON'S SPIRIT went to the lead to the quarter pole then
weakened but was able to hold on the the show. SHEER ELEMENT saved ground throughout, made a late mild bid in the stretch to finish evenly. MOR
VICTORY floated out on the first turn then raced near the back made a three wide bid on the backstretch and flattened out. FREE FROM GUILT was
unhurried through the final turn and passed tiring rivals. I SEE CLEARLY NOW raced in the middle of the pack early then dropped back and was not a
factor. MY MY LIMIT was restless in the gate then was forwardly placed in the three path to the final turn and tired.

CORRENTE DE OURO went to the lead to set all the pace and was kept to task. SHOETRICK tracked the leaders to the final turn then made a rail bid into
the stretch to prove second best. BELLA'S GATSBY saved ground then made a rail rally through the final turn to be best of the rest. TEQUILA
REVOLUTION was placed off the pace around the first turn then made a bid on the backstretch and faltered. WHEELS TURNING was allowed to settle
early then steadily advanced to improve his position. KISSMEISTER raced near the back around the first turn then made a four wide bid into the final turn
and faltered. SHANKINSTINE was forwardly placed in the three path through the first turn and weakened. SMARTY RIDGE raced in the middle of the pack
but was not a factor. ACCEL JOE was unhurried but was never a threat. TIME TO MOVE stalked the pace from the two path to the backstretch and gave
way.
