Footnotes
WHAT A COUNTRY broke out at the start, raced in midpack from the three path, swung out to take aim from the five path into the stretch, took the lead
passing the eighth pole, and held sway. MOTAGALLY dueled for the lead from inside, took over going into the turn, was cued turning into the lane, dug in
passing the eighth pole, but yielded late to place. CELERITY had a slow start, trailed from the three path into the stretch, and was gaining late to get up for
show. MAKE NOISE stalked from the outside of foes, moved up to bid from the three path around the turn, but flattened down the lane. SUBDUED dueled
for the lead from two wide early but gave way into the the turn. BOLD ADVENTURE had to steady at the start, raced from wellback inside and never
factored.

Footnotes
CATCHUSIFYOUCAN led from the two path, was cued going into the lane, opened up and went clear. ZMUDA stalked from inside, hooked up with an
outside rival for minor rewards at the top of the lane, and kept on to secure place. WHY BEHAVE tracked in the four path, was roused going into the stretch,
and finished evenly for show. FOREVER HOME raced from behind in the five path early, moved up four wide around the turn, swung out to take aim from
the six path into the stretch, but flattened out late. SUPORB pressed in the three path but faded turning into the lane. SUPERTALEOFHOUDINI chased from
the two path but was empty going into the stretch. LUCKY LAUREN raced from wellback in the four path but was no menace.

Footnotes
BIG BAD DIVA stalked from inside, moved up going into the turn, rallied from the two path down the lane, and got up late. GIANNA'S GIFT led from the two
path, opened up from the four path into the stretch, and ran on but was caught late to place. TILTINGATWINDMILLS trailed from the three path early, was
driven from the six path into the stretch, and kept on between rivals for show. GOOD PENNY chased in the three path, was roused from the seven path into
the lane, but finished evenly in the final furlong. XTREMA rated from inside but was one paced through the stretch. WATERS OF MEROM prompted the
pace in the four path, was ridden between foes into the lane, but was tired. ENCHANTED NILE pressed the pace in the three path but gaveway at the top of
the lane.

the seven path going into the lane, but was one paced. AMERICAN ICON chased from inside, shifted out to the five path going into the stretch, but was no

the pace in the four path early, led from the two path at the top of the stretch, but finished evenly for show. PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE chased in the three
path, drifted out through the stretch, and was one paced. COLD AS HELL led from the two path but yielded in upper stretch. SPEND BENJAMINS rated

Footnotes
RECKER POINT bumped with an inner rival at the start, raced in midpack from the four path, bid from the five path in upper stretch, and drifted in while
drawing clear. WINTERS LION tracked in the three path and kept on in the stretch to hold place. ACCIDENT bumped with an outer rival at the start and was
behind in the three path, moved up while five wide rounding the far turn, and ran on in the stretch for show. HUNTER'S DRIVE was held up in the two path,
had nowhere to go and was short of room along the rail in upper stretch, tipped out late, and finished evenly. EIGHT STRAIGHT prompted the pace from the
three path but faded gouing into the stretch. PERFECT UPSTART trailed from the four path into the lane and passed tired foes late. DR. HYDE raced from
off the pace in the three path, swung out to the six path going into the lane, but was no factor. RISKY CHOICE stalked from inside but was empty going into
the stretch. KLIMTOMANIAC raced from wellback inside and never threatened. MOTOWN COLLECTION chased from the two path but was no menace.
