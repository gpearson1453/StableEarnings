through the lane. RRACE DAY WARRIOR saved ground then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, cleared second inside
the eighth pole and closed the gap to late stretch. OTHER THINGS EQUAL settled off the rail, eased out with a bid into the backstretch, rounded the far turn
about the four path but flattened in the lane. RIGHTEOUS MAN raced well back inside, started a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the

lead at the three eighths and faded at the rail on the far turn. UPSY DAISY DO settled back in the two and three paths the first turn, picked up the chase
from the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn, angled out leaving the turn and showed little in the lane. BUFF N settled off the pace in the

MANDATE settled off the rail, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, angled to the four path on the far turn and finished well to take second the final strides.
BUBBA GRUMP rated the pace inside, dug in to the challenge of Muad'dib leaving the eighth pole and contested the far turn at a close disadvantage
nearest the rail, recovered a slim lead into the lane and dueled gamely to deep stretch before relenting. FREE SAILIN rounded the first turn about the four
path and settled just off the pace, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced close four wide on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane.
JUNGLE BEAST settled in the three path the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened in the lane.

path, left the turn widest and showed little in the lane. ALLEN CAN DO IT stalked the pace from the three path, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole
but weakened off the rail approaching the head of the lane. NO CHANGE rounded the opening turn in the four path and settled off the pace, picked up the
chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, eased out nearing the head of the lane and showed little more.

Footnotes
ON SPOT chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail, angled out and entered the stretch about the six path, dug in under steady handling
and got up the final strides. WAYNE'S HOPE closed to the lead at the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, raced at the rail on the turn, dug in
under steady stretch urging but was caught in the final strides. WOOTDAREITIS took a brief early lead then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
raced close off the rail on the turn and finished well but ceded second in late strides. ARE YOU HAPPY chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn
near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. TURTLENECK TED chased through the backstretch, raced three wide on the turn, was carried out into the lane and
showed little further. BIGAIRTOTHETHROWN chased, raced in the three path of the turn, eased out toward the head of the lane then weakened.
BOUBOLINO saved ground on the turn. JUBA'S YANKEE ONE was not a factor. CALL JOHN chased outside and rounded the turn about the four path. Dr.
Will ran loose in the post parade and was a late scratch.
