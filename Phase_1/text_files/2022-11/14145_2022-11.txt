Footnotes
DEBIT CARD dueled with Crack the Code from along the inside, shook that one off to open clear nearing the eighth pole and maintained a safe advantage.
CELTIC COUSEN saved ground stalking the pace, angled out to split rivals entering the stretch, could not reach the winner but finished strongly for the
place. CRACK THE CODE prompted the pace from along the outside into the stretch and weakened slightly late. CLASSIC LEGEND was allowed to settle
in stride, came five-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. SPORTS EDITOR steadied soon after the break, dropped back early, came seven-wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten. GOLDBAR was forwardly placed early, came six-wide into the stretch and tired. POINT OF AN AFFAIR stumbled at the start,
moved up to be prominent for a half mile while five-wide and gave way.

Footnotes
I GOT A ROCK was sent along to the the pace, held well clear and maintained his advantage under steady pressure. BIGMANCAN raced in hand while
being reserved off the pace, moved up five deep on the turn and rallied well. BATTLEBUS stalked the issue while racing three-wide, offered a bid entering
the stretch and gave way grudgingly late. INDEFATIGABLE was allowed to settle in stride, rallied six-deep into the stretch but lacked the needed late
response. FLASHINTHENIGHT was off a step slow, moved up along the inside on the turn. FUEL THE BERN raced off the early pace while saving ground,
steadied in traffic nearing the eighth pole and finished willingly when clear. PIT STOP MAN was forwardly placed while racing four-deep and faded.
HEATHER'S GOLD was up close early while racing two-wide and tired. PANSTER dropped back early and was not a factor.

WYATT RIDGELY was bumped at the start, then was allowed to settle in stride, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole. was bumped by Imagine a
Cure leaving the eighth pole, then came in slightly to bump with that one nearing the sixteenth pole and prevailed in a stiff drive. IMAGINE A CURE
prompted the early pace while racing three-wide, angled to the inside entering the start, came back out bumping with the winner leaving the eighth pole
while looking for room, then was bumped by that one nearing the sixteenth pole and continued on gamely to the wire. FOWL NATION broke out to bump
with the winner at the start, then saved ground while being reserved off the pace, angled out entering the stretch and was gaining ground late.
DAREDAVITE was unhurried early, rallied six-wide into the stretch and gained his best stride too late. SILVER PATRON was forwardly placed from the
start, came five-wide into the stretch and went evenly. RASCALLY REBEL saved ground while racing in the middle of the pack but lacked a response when
asked. BIGZ'S CABANA BOY bumped at the start with Pop Socks, then saved ground setting the pressured pace to the stretch and tired. POP SOCKS was
bumped at the start, then pressed the pace for a half mile from along the outside and tired. BARB'S PRIDE gave way after showing brief speed. THE
JOCKEY OF IMAGINE A CURE LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER, BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS, THE STEWARDS MADE NO
CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
YOUNG TURK saved ground setting the pace in hand, opened up after being roused in upper stretch and drew off to win while kept to task. DIVINE LAW,
off slowly, edged up outside rivals nearing the turn, prompted the winner around the turn, gave willing pursuit past mid stretch then kept on to hold down the
place. STAR SHOPPING was reserved off the early pace, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished in a mild rally. MAILMAN'S A FLYER
was unhurried early, rallied four-wide into the stretch and gained his best stride too late. LYING JEFF settled in the middle of the pack while racing four-wide
and finished willingly. GREAT IDEA dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. MOSLER SAFE was forwardly placed
while racing three-wide and tired during the drive. BORN FOR VICTORY was unruly pre race, unseating his rider and running off for about a furlong, then
showed brief early speed and gave way. QUINCANNON steadied from between horses nearing the half mile pole and showed little thereafter. ARISTOCAT
was close up early racing along the inside and faded.

Footnotes
IT'S VIPER was reserved off the early pace, moived up racing between horses on the turn, came four-wide into the stretch and proved narrowly best in a
stiff drive. HOME SCHOOL was unhurried early, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out splitting rivals to come three-wide into the stretch, caught
the leaders nearing the eighth pole and just missed in a game try. GENERAL J R was allowed to settle in stride, offer a early bid on the turn to dispute the
issue into the stretch and weakened slightly late. DUKE OF DOOLY saved ground setting the pace to the stretch and tired during the drive.
ANNIESALLINCLUSIVE was forwardly placed while racing four-wide but lacked a rally. BONDED settled in the middle of the pack while racing two-wide, but
lacked a response when asked. WESRIGHT prompted the pace from along the outside for five furlongs and faded. ALLIWORSHIPNADORE dropped back
early and failed to threaten. BUBBA CHROME saved ground while racing close up for a half mile and gave way. UNCAPTURED STORM saved ground
while racing along the inside but had no response when asked.

Footnotes
OUR STRONG VOWS settled in the middle of the pack, rallied five-deep into the stretch, gained the lead nearing the eighth pole and was kept to task to
maintain a safe advantage. JOIN THE DOTS was reserved off the early pace, rallied four-deep and finished strongly. IN VAIN saved ground while racing
close up, angled out to split rivals during the drive and continued on well to the wire in a game try. TRANSLATE saved ground racing in the middle of the
pack, angled out nearing the eighth pole and was gaining late. BRUSHING dropped back early, came six-deep into the stretch and gained her best stride
too late. CAROLINA SUN was unhurried early, came five-deep into the stretch and failed to threaten. BETTER CALL MAMA was close up to the stretch
while racing three-deep and faded. ISLAND PHILO, shuffled into the turn, dropped back early and was not a factor. QUEEN SHEBA was in tight early,
lacked room in upper stretch and failed to threaten. I'M GITTIN THERE settled in the middle of the pack, lacked room nearing the eighth pole and finished
willingly when clear. FLIRTATIOUS LASS was sent along to set the pace to near the stretch and faded. BLAZING STAR (GB) chased the pace while racing
two-deep to near the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
FEELING WOOZY broke out to bump with Malibu Cowboy at the start, then dueled with General Nooz for the early lead from along the outside, shook that
one off after three furlongs to open a clear advantage and won without need of urging. CIRCLING THE DRAIN was forwardly placed while racing
three-wide, offered a bid nearing the quarter pole, could not reach the winner but continued on well for the place. GENERAL NOOZ disputed the early pace
from along the inside, could not stay with the winner and weakened during the drive. LAMARVELOUS saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride,
angled out for the drive and finished in a mlld rally. TERMSOFENGAGEMENT was reserved off the pace while racing four-wide and lacked a rally.
ALOTTACENTS raced in the middle of the pack while two-wide and went evenly. PAVONI was off slow, saved ground and failed to seriously factor.
MALIBU COWBOY was bumped at the start, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths pole and then faded. COLPO D'ORO stopped after
showing brief spped.

SECRET SANCTUARY was allowed to settle in stride, rallied five-wide the final quarter and finished well in a good effort. AWESOME DYNAMO stalked the
pace racing in hand, moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole, but was unable to sustain his rally. SEE OUT saved ground racing in the
middle of the pace, split rivals on the turn, angled out for the drive but lacked the needed late response. STEADY EDDIE dropped back early and failed to
seriously threaten. GUNDRY hopped in the air at the start, then was forwardly placed for five furlongs while three-wide and faded. RED DEVOLUTION
saved ground setting the pace to near the quarter pole and tired. OBOY vied for the lead from along the outside for a half mile and stopped.
