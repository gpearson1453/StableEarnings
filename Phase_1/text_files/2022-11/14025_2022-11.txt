Footnotes
C F V TEXAS RED set the pace on a clear lead into the first turn, maintained the advantage into mid-turn, widened into the lane and appeared a winner
then began to shorten stride inside the sixteenth pole and was under a drive to last. BOULDER BAY stalked the winner from the two path into the far turn,
lost contact with that one into the lane, stayed on well and was reeling in the top one but ran out of real-estate. TOUR THE MOON was along the inside
through the turns and into the lane and moved up for the show spot. NATES HEARTTHROB was off a step slow, raced in the two path through the far turn
while well back of the leading trio, came off the rail further into the lane and lacked the needed response. COG chased the pace from the three path through
mid-turn then tired after entering the lane. CONSIDER never a factor while in the three or two paths through the turns. JUST PHIL trailed throughout while
saving ground.

Footnotes
SHADOW BELLE set the pace from the outset, was under pressure through mid-turn, repelled that rival after straightening in the lane then widened to the
wire. MS MAGGIE was in the three path through the turn, bid into the lane from the four path, loomed a serious threat approaching the eighth pole then
leveled out through the final sixteenth. MISS SOVELIA pressed the pace two wide through the turn, lost some ground to the winner once straightened in the
lane then weakened the final eighth. RIO LADY trailed into the first call while along the inside, was asked for more through the turn, gained on the leaders
into the lane then flattened out. MY HEAD HURTS was close up early while in the two path into the turn then steadily faded.

Footnotes
CLEVER KATE was unhurried while near the inside, came off the rail into the lane when gaining momentum, stayed on well and reeled in the pacesetter
and just got up. SKYS IMAGE chased the clear pacesetter through the far turn, was asked for more in late turn, came further off the rail into the lane, caught
and passed the leader when straightening, cleared outside the eighth pole and was all out to the wire but could not hold. WILADENE was in the four path
through the turns when unhurried, bid into the lane from the five path and moved up for the show spot while not a threat to the top two. TRIP CHARGE was
in the six to the three path through the first turn while being floated out, in the two path through the far turn and lacked a bid. QUITE WHIMSICAL took over
into the backstretch, raced off to a clear lead into the far turn then gave way once headed. RED ROSEBUSH trailed throughout while along the inside.

CLASSY DREAM chased the two rival duel down the backstretch and into the far turn, continued in the three path through the turn, swung into the lane from
the five path, gained a short lead near the eighth pole and inched up late. CRICKENBERGER vied for the lead along the inside and in the two path, led in
late turn and into the lane while off the inside, lost the lead to inside rival when straightening into the lane, was moving to the lead when joined by the winner
near the eighth pole, dueled with that one to inside the sixteenth pole and could not keep up late. EXPLOSIVE SKIES tracked the pace along the inside
through the turn, cut the corner into the lane and grabbed the lead near the three-sixteenths pole then could not finish with the top two while along the rail.
SASSY KATIE was in the three path through the turns, swung into the lane from the five path, had aim on the top ones inside the eighth pole but needed
more. SINGLE HER vied for the lead two wide through the far turn then yielded to others. CHIMES was never a factor while along the inside. ARRINGTON
trailed throughout while near the inside.

Footnotes
AZURITA was off awkwardly and steadied at the start, rallied five wide at the three-eighths pole and drew off late under mild urging. SUMMER HOME was
clear early but couldn't hold off the winner. LASHES stalked the pace in the four path with no late bid. E STREET ANGEL raced evenly in the three path.
SECOND EXCHANGE improved position late. SWEET JUSTICE stalked the pace inside, then faded in the stretch. INCREDIBLE JUSTICE stalked the pace
inside before giving way. ARCHIE'S GIRL was through early.
