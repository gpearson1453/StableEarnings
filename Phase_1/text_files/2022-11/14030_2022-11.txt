Footnotes
ALBERTA BE MINE broke slow trailing at the start, was hustled down the backside to get a good tracking position behind the contesting trio into the turn,
pounced on the leaders three wide at the top of the stretch, took control at the furlong marker and drew away late. PANIC SWITCH settled in mid pack
racing four wide at the half mile marker, rallied three wide around runners midpoint on the turn, began to lengthen her stride in upper stretch and closed well
besting the rest at the wire. RASHIDA broke sharp to lead early, engaged for the top spot three wide into the turn, assumed command midway running on
the turn, fought on between horses at the top of the stretch and faded the final sixteenth to hold for show. RUMOURS FLY stalked in the middle of the pack
between foes down the backside, slipped up the fence racing on the turn and showed good late energy at the furlong marker to finish up on the fringes.
SEATTLE TRUST was situated on the rail midfield down the backstretch, took closer order to the leaders into the turn, was compromised while avoiding a
pulling up rival at the five sixteenths pole and could not regroup afterwards to be a threat. FABULEUX AT DAWN was part of the early speed duel between
rivals, pressed on the rail for the top spot at the quarter pole, fought on inside turning for home, gave way at the eighth pole and tired in deep stretch. FLAT
OUT ANGEL was allowed to settle into stride trailing down the backside, commenced a brief run outside on the turn and could not get interested running
through the stretch. QUEEN'S IMAGE travelled near the rear in the early stages, advanced up the rail three furlongs to the wire, was eased midturn to avoid
a fellow runner and was not persevered with galloping to the finish. CHRISTINA'S RING battled on the rail for the lead entering the turn, took a bad step
inside five sixteenths from the finish, was pulled up immediately and vanned off.

Footnotes
VEERY tracked in behind the pacesetter from the two path, moved out three wide commencing a bid, took over past the three-sixteenths and was soon
clear, held safe. WINYAH BAY lacked early speed despite encouragement, shifted in on the turn going three then two wide on that bend and advanced
inside rivals past the quarter pole before coming back out five to six deep, gained steadily and slowly but was only second best. BORN TO BE GOOD was
reserved well off the pace racing outside a foe two to three wide on much of the turn, shifted six deep into upper stretch then moved out a bit further, was
best of the rest. TOUCH OF ROUGE angled in early, advanced inside foes just off the rail on the turn, came out at the top of the stretch, lacked the needed
late kick. SIMPLE SOUVENIR broke awkwardly, settled off the pace, swung ten wide, ran on but just missed the minor award. CLASSIC QUEEN settled
toward the rear inside on or just off the rail, came out about four wide turning for home and a bit wider in upper stretch, ran on mildly. SPEEDY LYNN
pursued the pace from outside foes going four to five wide on the turn, failed to rally. STORM GAUGE chased from outside five to six wide on the turn, had
no late bid. BID ONCE moved clear to set the pace, faltered at the top of the stretch and faded. TAPITURE WAY pursued from between runners three to
four wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
SPANISH BEAUTY took control from the start, was left alone unchallenged up front setting the fractions on the turn, drew away when roused in mid stretch
and won easily crossing the wire. TIZ BIZNESS broke in at the start, advanced up the rail into the turn, slipped up the fence five sixteenths to the finish,
chased the winner in vain in upper stretch and had to settle for second best in the end. LADY XI travelled on the rail in the middle of the pack in the early
stages, shifted out four wide at the furlong marker to rally and closed in to capture third money in a tight photo at the finish line. I'M EXCEPTIONAL was
ridden hard four wide in midfield at the quarter pole, angled out six wide at the top of the stretch and showed interest through the lane to narrowly lose the
show award at the wire. FOREST VIXEN tracked the frontrunners three wide entering the turn, put in a brief run to threaten the leader at the quarter pole,
could not gain on the winner in upper stretch and stalled in the final sixteenth. SO BREANNA chased the loose winner inside into the turn, was asked for run
between horses two furlongs to the finish, offered little response and weakened on the drive outside the final eighth. SPIRIT O'TIPPERARY was situated
near the back of the field on the rail racing down the backside, two furlongs from the line was urged for more run and had no finish to give inside driving to
the wire. DANCING FOR MONEY trailed the field with a half to run, saved ground through the turn, waited inside behind a tiring runner in upper stretch,
shifted out four wide at the furlong marker and made no impact. AQUA LUNA stalked near the rear just outside at the half mile marker, angled out five wide
turning for home and could not get involved racing to the finish. PRETTY SENSATIONAL broke sharp, rated just behind the leaders in the two path running
down the backstretch, was ridden for more midway on the turn and retreated between rivals through the stretch.

Footnotes
HIT THE POINT angled in and settled last but one, began to edge closer heading to the far turn, fanned seven wide into the stretch, struck the lead past the
three-sixteenths, drew clear and held safe while being kept to the task. KIDDIE HOLIDAY settled off the pace mid-pack about two to three wide, moved just
in behind the eventual winner going four then six wide on the far turn, took over second in upper- to mid-stretch, could not kick on with the winner but held
the place from STOP THE HUMBUG, who shifted in and settled toward the back, saved some ground through the first turn and raced near but just off the
fence through the far turn, found room between rivals in upper stretch then rallied inside others nearing the furlong marker, needed more for second but was
best of the rest. TOURIST'S DREAM raced outside the middle group three wide, took closer order four then five wide on the turn, was passed by the top two
from outside then switched outside those in upper stretch and ran on. MR. AGRO settled outside three to four wide early, moved closer five then six wide on
the far turn to within striking distance but could only keep on evenly. LARAQUE saved ground early, moved out to be three wide on the far turn, came out
further in upper stretch, ran on evenly. MAD DOG N JOE was mildly coaxed to the fore, moved clear and extended the advantage while shifting near the
inside, faltered and faded. BROKE AN BROKEN trailed early, swung seven to eight wide for the drive and passed two tired foes. MAXIMUM DANGER
tracked from inside, came up empty. SAME AGAIN DOC switched off the inside on the first turn, raced two to three wide into the far turn, faded in the
stretch.

Footnotes
PRIDE AND PASSION tracked just behind the frontrunning leaders on the rail into the turn, slipped up the fence five sixteenths left for the lead, opened up
in mid stretch while urged left handed and drew away comfortably for the win. OMEGA MOON was unhurried down the backside trailing the field, began to
pick off runners circling foes outside at the three eighths pole, angled eight wide for the drive and closed in well to be a non threatening second. FIFTH
SEASON rated kindly behind the pace trio on the rail throughout the turn, shifted out six wide for clear running room at the top of the stretch and offered a
good finish between horses to get up for the show award. BIG LEAGUE broke sharp to be on top leaving the chute, was headed outside three furlongs left
to run, chased the winner in vain at the top of the lane and tired in deep stretch losing place and show nearing the finish. CRUMLIN EXPERIENCE settled
near the rear in the beginning, trailed the field on the turn, shifted out in the seven path in mid stretch and passed tired runners with good late interest in the
final furlong. COO BIRD rallied four wide midpoint on the turn, was in contention outside six wide turning for home and levelled off the final sixteenth to be a
non factor. DR CHAPPELL travelled near the back three wide outside foes in the early stages, was urged to go after horses midway on the turn, could not
make an impression turning for home and finished up evenly. CORRELATE stalked in the middle of the pack inside, took closer order to the frontrunners
three eighths remaining, had clear run on the fence at the top of the lane and could not quicken through the stretch to be a factor. STEEL WOOL rated in
the second flight with runners on either side racing down the backstretch, was ridden hard to keep pace with the leaders two furlongs from the line and could
not gain in the lane to make an impression. PERLARANA stalked at the half between challengers, waited behind rivals running through the turn, found a
clear lane two wide at the eighth pole and could not gain to be a presence at the finish line. STRIKING HEIR was squeezed at the start, tracked the pace
just outside in the early running, pressed outside three eighth from the finish, gave way between rivals at the quarter pole and stopped in upper stretch.

Footnotes
GUNS N' ROJAS broke a step slowly, shifted in and steadily advanced inside up the backstretch and early on the far turn, shifted out past the
five-sixteenths, was five wide at the quarter pole, six wide in upper stretch, took aim and drove past inside the final seventy yards. MR SPEED attended the
pace from outside five wide, moved in to three wide late on the turn taking the lead past the quarter pole, was clear by mid-stretch but outkicked. STREET
SERENADE broke inwardly and steadied ever so slightly, shifted in racing toward the back, advanced inside a rival on the far turn, moved out about the
five-sixteenths swinging eight wide into upper stretch, kicked on well but too late. JIM'S HOPE raced off the pace inside, moved out four wide coming past
the quarter pole, kept on well but needed more. BIG RANSOM was forwardly-positioned tracking the leading quintet in behind and off the inside, moved out
from about three to seven wide turning for home, kept on in the lane. AURA OF GOLD contested the pace inside moving to a narrow lead about the
three-eighths, was overtaken leaving the turn, switched outside that foe in upper stretch and evened out. STEPHEN B GOOD lacked early speed, shifted in
racing near but off the inside, improved from between runners four wide in the stretch. SEATTLE POINT chased briefly early, steadily dropped back in the
two to three path, moved out six wide turning for home and ran on. RIVER OF BABYLON was ridden along early going five to six wide on the turn, failed to
menace. DO THE GRIDDY broke inwardly bumping a rival, vied four wide between runners, came up empty. ABSOLUTE CHAIRMAN broke outwardly
bumping a rival, vied between two wide, came up empty. GRAND AMBITION was bumped from both sides at the start, vied three wide between runners,
came up empty.

Footnotes
GRAND ALLIANCE kept his sights on the leaders tracking outside three furlongs left to run, loomed in the six path turning for home outside of rivals and
wore down the leader through the entire stretch to get up for the narrow victory right at the finish line. HEAT MERCHANT settled near the rear on the rail
early on, advanced nicely on the fence to have a good tracking position into the turn, bid between horses at the quarter marker, began to inch away from
rivals at the eighth pole and was caught by the closing winner right at the finish. STYLISH GENT broke sharp while hustled to lead down the backside, was
headed outside two furlongs from the line, yielded grudgingly at the furlong marker with rivals on either side and rebid stubbornly to get up for show.
JACKIE'S PRIDE settled behind foes under restraint in mid pack into the turn, rallied up the fence at the quarter pole, contended on the rail in mid stretch
and needed more late to threaten for the top three placings at the wire. PASSTHEPUDDINPLEAZ trailed the field in the beginning, continued to see them all
on the turn, angled out seven wide for the stretch run and passed tired runners down the lane. MIDNIGHT RAMBLIN chased the leader in the early stages,
engaged for the front three wide at the quarter pole, lead briefly at the top of the lane, gave way in the four path with an eighth remaining and tired in deep
stretch. EXCEED travelled near the back of the pack three wide at the half mile pole, was ridden to go on through the turn and offered little effort running to
the finish. DOCTOR WU stalked in the middle of the field under a snug hold four wide at the half, was coaxed for more three wide midpoint on the turn,
offered no response and could not make an impression the the finish.

Footnotes
COLTONS DREAM was quickly clear, dictated terms near the rail, widened into upper stretch, held safe while taken in hand very late. BOKERMIN chased
the winner from inside, moved out in upper stretch, kept on and was second best. HIGHLAND SOCIETY advanced inside, came out about the quarter pole,
was five wide at the top of the stretch, ran on with mild late interest to improve. BIG EXECUTIVE fanned seven wide, evened out in the drive. I'M A CHI
TOO pressed the eventual winner two to three wide, lacked the needed late kick. BLUE MAX settled off the pace and off the inside going two to three wide
on the turn, rallied inside foes in the stretch to improve position. HIGH HEAT stalked from outside four to six wide, lacked the needed late kick. BEYOND
BORDERS lacked early speed and switched outside a rival while trailing, advanced mildly five to six wide on the turn and ran on. DOINGGOODTROUBLE
chased early racing just off the inside, retreated. YZERMAN was outpaced racing off the inside and was never near enough to threaten. COMMANDER
TOM swung nine wide into the stretch and was not a factor. ONE PUNCH CHARLIE was up close five wide early, dropped back and had no rally.

Footnotes
SUPREMEACTION had a good tracking trip inside behind the frontrunner into the turn, shifted just outside to engage for the lead three sixteenths from
home, took over at the furlong pole and was kept to the task in deep stretch to hold on for the victory. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) was allowed to settle inside
near the back in the beginning, advanced up the fence midway on the turn, shifted out for clear run in the three path for the drive and was gaining down the
lane but not enough the threaten for the win. CONFIDENT N ELITE took control from the start, continued to be the frontrunner racing though the turn, was
headed outside by the winner at the furlong marker, offered little resistance but finished up with some intent to hold safe for show at the wire. TARA
TATTOO raced in the middle of the field with runners on either side five sixteenths from the finish, rallied splitting horses nearing the furlong pole and dug in
while on the wrong lead to capture a small piece of the prize at the wire. SCENIC HOLIDAY trailed the pack in the early stages, saved ground running on
the turn, offered some good energy on the fence late to be involved for the minors at the finish line. MYSTIC POINT tracked just off the fence keeping in
range of the pacesetters while well in hand entering the turn, pressed for more six wide to be in the hunt for a small share turning for home and stalled in the
drive to the wire. MAGIC SPIN advanced outside foes four wide at the half mile marker, was asked three wide for run on the turn, could not gain on the
leaders entering the stretch and raced evenly to the wire. AHMAS was situated near the back of the pack running down the backstretch, urged for more run
at the top of the lane and could not be a factor to the finish. SILENT LUCIDITY was brushed at the start, tracked three wide to be in the mix of things two
furlongs from the finish, floated out to the seven path turning for home and weakened the last eighth. MORE THAN HAPPY was brushed on the break,
travelled midfield between rivals at the half, lost ground to the field while ridden on the turn and could not get interested in the late stages of the race. LIARS
CLUB pressed the leader just outside down the backside, continued to chase the early pacesetter throughout the turn, began to fade with runners on either
side in upper stretch and faltered at the furlong marker running on the wrong lead to the finish.
