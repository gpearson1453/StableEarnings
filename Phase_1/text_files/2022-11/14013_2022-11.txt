INTO GOLD allowed to settle, closed rapidly three then two wide through the turn, inherited the lead in upper stretch and drew off under mild right handed
urging. ROLLIN SO PERFECT trailed early, dropped from the four path to the rail past mid stretch, closed with a burst of speed and finished second best.
SQUEAKY CLEAN settled mid pack then found his best stride late in the six path. LINO'S KID saved ground and failed to respond. OXBOW'S RIDE
unhurried early, passed tiring rivals outside and was bothered late. WHISKEY HELPS was outrun and bumped late. EL CONDOR CAZA was never
involved. FAST AS FAST CAN B sped to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace into the stretch, drifted out late and stopped. BUCKEYE RED
chased the leader through the turn, was shut off by that one in deep stretch causing his rider to checked and angle out bumping WHISKEY HELPS and lost
all momentum. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

VASARIANO stalked the pace for a half, made the lead and quickly opened a daylight advantage on the far turn then widened the balance of the trip to win
as much the best while being kept to task. SNOWSCAPE trailed early, had a mild rally outside and finished clear for second. CARMEL BAY passed tiring
rivals. GOODBYELLOWBRICKRD pressed the pace two wide and weakened in the stretch. STAY THIRSTY AMIGO was no factor. ICON rushed to the lead
entering the clubhouse turn, was taken under a strong hold, set the pace for five furlongs then stopped.

STONE COLD CAT slow early, closed with a burst of speed out past the middle of the racetrack and got up in the final strides. DOUGS MORNING PICK
never far back, rallied in the middle of the racetrack to make the lead in deep stretch then just missed hanging on. KISSINGER trailed early, the finished
determinedly along the rail. BLUE MONARCH failed to menace. MASTEROFTHEHOUNDS stalked the early pace, loomed boldly three wide nearing the
quarter pole then failed to sustain that bid. FOREIGN vied for the early lead in the five path, dropped inside on the turn, checked while lacking room at the
quarter pole then faded late. MA MOO POWER was no factor. OL' NED away alertly, set the pace until deep stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
STAR HAWK stalked the pace four wide into the far turn, rallied three wide to make the lead nearing the top of the stretch then widened the balance of the
trip under a hand ride to win as much the best. FAT DADDY pressed the pace three then two wide into the stretch then was no match for the winner while
clearly second best. THRU THE VINE pressed the early pace two wide, made the lead, set the pace to the top of the stretch along the inside then was
outfinished. DYRDEK set the early pace while getting slow fractions and was through after a half. PICKFORD was no factor. CLAW was no threat. SHELL
FIRE was through early.
