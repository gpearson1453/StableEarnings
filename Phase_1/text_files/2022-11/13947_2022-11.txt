Footnotes
HOLIDAY HUSTLE tracked the solid early fractions while outside of rivals, gained ground three deep nearing the quarter marker, took command off of the
turn, kept to task inside of the furlong marker and held in a drive in the late stages. ARMOUR PLATE was allowed to settle while never far back, saved
ground through the turn, came in tight and lacked room nearing the top of the lane, found room in upper stretch along the rail, was outkicked in the final
sixteenth and was up for place in the final strides. DRAW THE FOUL stalked the early pace, raced two wide through the turn, lost ground in mid-stretch, was
outfinished in deep stretch but kept on to get up for show. MAGICISTHEMOONLITE broke a step slowly, was hustled to contest the early pace, set solid
fractions while pressed to the quarter marker, could not match strides with HOLIDAY HUSTLE nearing the furlong marker, weakened in the final stages and
was just edged for show. LUCK IS GOLDEN showed early speed, pressed the quick pace through the turn, dropped back nearing mid-stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ROSEBUD RYDE broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, was well rated while setting decent fractions, turned away KOKO'S MOM along the second
turn, drew clear to mid-stretch and kept to task in the final sixteenth. KOKO'S MOM tracked the decent early fractions, advanced on the backstretch run to
prompt the pace to the second turn, lost ground to ROSEBUD RYDE nearing the quarter marker, chased that foe to mid-stretch and was outkicked while
besting the rest. SMILING MELANIE was allowed to settle, advanced along the backstretch run to take a stalking position into the far turn, saved ground to
the top of the lane, did not produce a late rally and was an easy third in the end. SISTER'S REVENGE broke out at the start and was away a bit slowly, was
unhurried in the early stages, lost contact on the far turn, was eased through the stretch run and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
STATEFOREST broke in good order and established the early advantage, was well handled while setting decent fractions through the backstretch run,
extended the lead and drew clear to mid-stretch, pulled away in the final sixteenth and was geared down in the final strides as much the best. MISS
FLAWLESS (FR) was a bit erratic early and spotted the field into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run, came two wide to the quarter
marker, was no match for the winner in the final furlong but held well in the end for place. HERE COMES RALPHIE was allowed to settle, saved ground into
the backstretch run, gained ground two wide nearing the top of the lane, did not offer a late response but stayed on in the end to secure the show.
NORTHERN ROSE was away a bit slowly and settled off of the early pace, saved ground into the backstretch run, raced outside of rivals on the far turn,
swung widest into the drive and finished evenly in the stretch run. ZABAVA tracked the decent early fractions from a two wide path, maintained position
through the backstretch run, came three then four wide to the top of the stretch, was outrun approaching the eighth pole and gave way. CLASS CODE was
forwardly placed in the early stages, prompted the decent fractions through the backstretch run, kept close attendance to STATEFOREST to the quarter
marker, could not keep pace with that rival in upper stretch and faded. SAY IT WITH ROSES stalked the early pace from an inside path, raced close to the
pace to the second turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker, lost action nearing mid-stretch, was pulled up and was vanned off.

HAPPY DOES settled just off of the early fractions, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run, advanced along the rail nearing the quarter marker,
overtook SMOKIN' HOT in upper stretch, kept to task through the final furlong and held safely in the final sixteenth to prevail. CHUCKANUT BAY stalked the
early pace while between runners, maintained position through the backstretch run, stayed a bit in tight along the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch, closed
well inside of the furlong marker, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and secured second in the final strides. SMOKIN' HOT showed good early
speed and dictated terms into the first turn, set solid fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker
while two wide, was overtaken by the winner and chased HAPPY DOES to mid-stretch, was outfinished in the final stages and just held for show. STOLEN
VOTE was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the second turn, came two wide into the drive, found his best stride late and just missed for show
in the final strides. SEA DOG broke out at the start and carried out PROSPECT OF RAIN, showed early speed and attended to the decent pace through the
backstretch run, advanced nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace in the stretch run and gave way. PROSPECT OF RAIN was carried out at the
start and was away a step slowly, was never far back while settling off of the decent fractions, lost position on the far turn, was outrun in upper stretch and
tired late.

Footnotes
LOOKIN TO EXCEL was away in good order and showed good early speed, set quick fractions through the turn, extended the lead leaving the bend, drew
off in the stretch run and was hand urged to the wire as much the best. IMPRESSIVE CURLS was forwardly placed in the early going, pressed the quick
fractions to the quarter marker, could not keep pace with the winner in the drive but kept on in deep stretch to secure the place. HAVAKASH READY came
under a tight hold in the early going and stalked the quick pace to the turn, saved ground while close up approaching the quarter marker, was outrun by
LOOKIN TO EXCEL in upper stretch, lacked a late rally and was just edged for place, while well clear in the end for show. BLUE SILVER chased the fast
pace, came three wide into the drive and was not a late factor. SNOW HILL lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not offer a late
response. RIVER'S BEHEST bobbled at the start, settled off of the quick early fractions, came four wide off of the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
MY YAMMY LADY was well positioned while settling off of the early pace, raced two wide through the turn, angled out three wide off of the turn, lost ground
in upper stretch, raced on the left lead while advancing inside of the furlong marker, made a late surge in the final strides and was up in time to prevail.
MATCHLESS was sent to dispute the early fractions, dueled on the front end to the quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch, drew to a clear lead in deep
stretch, was all out in the final strides and was nailed on the wire for the win, while besting the rest. SASSY TINKERBELL broke alertly and showed good
early speed, dueled for pace duties with MATCHLESS through the turn, lost ground to that rival in upper stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth and just
held on for third in the final strides. PRETTY THIRSTY lacked early speed, came two wide along the turn, improved position while racing evenly into
mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and just missed for show in the final strides. DALLAS ALICE was off a step slowly, chased from the rear in
the early stages, gained ground three wide on the turn, swung four wide into the drive, could not sustain that rally and flattened out. BLUE EYED JO was
forwardly placed on the run to the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker and gave way in the stretch. NIGHT CRUISER tracked the early pace, raced
outside of rivals on the turn, came four wide into the drive and tired.

Footnotes
MASTERY KAT showed early speed and was prominent into the first turn, tracked the early pace then advanced to press the solid fractions to the second
turn, overtook ALL HALLOWS leaving the quarter marker, took a narrow advantage to mid-stretch, repelled foes to deep stretch and gamely dug in in the
final strides to prevail. TEA N CONVERSATION came in tight on the run into the first turn, settled three wide off of the solid early pace, improved position
nearing the half-mile marker, continued that gain while five wide on the far turn, found her best stride late, came within aim of MASTERY KAT in the final
sixteenth and just missed for the win in the final strides. AUTISM COMMUNITY was unprepared at the start and was off slowly, was a bit green into the first
turn and drifted out but recovered to be two wide into the backstretch run, maintained position to the half-mile marker, advanced two wide on the far turn,
angled out in upper stretch, closed well nearing mid-stretch, was outfinished in the final stages and held safely in the end for show. NOSHEWONT was a bit
fractious in the gate, saved ground into the first turn, was well placed through the backstretch run while just off of the pace, gained ground three wide
nearing the quarter marker, continued that advance to mid-stretch, vied for the lead nearing the eighth pole and was outkicked in deep stretch. ULTIMATE
DIVA came in tight entering the first turn, was allowed to settle through the backstretch run, was roused six wide on the far turn, gained ground nearing the
furlong marker but could not sustain that run and flattened out. IRISH SONG LEADER came in tight on the run into the first turn, settled in the second flight
through the backstretch run, lost position on the far turn, improved in upper stretch and lacked a late rally. ALL HALLOWS broke alertly and showed good
early speed, set a pressured pace through the backstretch run, was prompted by MASTERY KAT to the quarter pole, lost position nearing the furlong
marker and gave way. GIRL NAMED DORIS was unhurried, trailed to the second turn while saving ground and was not a factor. BOURBON GLAZE was
forwardly placed in the early stages, came three wide into the backstretch run, advanced nearing the half-mile marker, stalked the pace to the quarter pole,
dropped back leaving the far turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
BUENISIMO raced closest to the loose pacesetter through the early stages, came two wide into the far turn, matched strides with AMERICAN FARMER
leaving the second turn, dueled with his game stablemate through the final furlong and made a late push in the final strides to prevail. AMERICAN FARMER
saved ground while settling off of the early pace, followed the loose pacesetter into the second turn, overtook DIAMOND BLITZ leaving the quarter marker,
was confronted by BUENISIMO in upper stretch, dueled from the inside with that foe while under left-handed urging and was gamely bested in the final
strides, while holding for place. OUR SILVER OAK hopped at the start and was off a step slowly, was unhurried in the early going, raced two wide on the
second turn, roused three wide in upper stretch, came within aim nearing the furlong marker, hung in deep stretch, could not reel in the top pair late and was
clear for show in the end. MEMO DADDY (CHI) was allowed to settle, raced outside of rivals through the backstretch run, came three wide along the far
turn, swung four wide into the drive and did not mount a late rally. DIAMOND BLITZ broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set quick fractions while on
a long lead through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, stopped in upper stretch and was not asked for run late.

Footnotes
I'MGONNABESOMEBODY showed early speed to establish the pace, was well handled while setting solid fractions through the backstretch run, came
under pressure nearing the quarter marker, turned away JIMMY BLUE JEANS nearing the furlong marker, kept to task in deep stretch and held sway in the
final strides over the oncoming runner-up to set a new track record. FREEPORT JOE was unhurried in the early stages, maintained position through the
backstretch run, loomed four wide nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to the eighth pole, closed fast in deep stretch, could not reel in the winner in the
final stages and was up for place. LAMMAS (GB) saved ground into the first turn, settled off of the solid early fractions, advanced along the inside on the far
turn, continued to gain into mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and was just edged for place in the final strides. KANDEREL bobbled at the start
and was off a step slowly, rated off of the solid early fractions, gained ground from a two wide path on the far turn, tipped out for the drive, lost position on
the run to mid-stretch and finished evenly in the final stages. HARMON was allowed to settle, raced two wide through the backstretch run while never far
back, came in tight a bit entering the second turn, was steered three wide nearing the quarter marker, trailed to mid-stretch and offered a mild late rally. A
MAN'S MAN stalked the early pace, came three wide into the backstretch run, gained ground on the second turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch,
came in tight nearing the furlong marker and weakened in the late stages. JIMMY BLUE JEANS was asked to show early speed and was forwardly placed
into the first turn, stalked the solid fractions through the backstretch run, advanced nearing the quarter marker to challenge I'MGONNABESOMEBODY, lost
position in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
LAST INNING pushed for speed from the break, gained the rail and the lead going into the first turn, extended his advantage going into the far turn, was
engaged by LIGHT UP to the outside at the top of the stretch, battled the length of the stretch and stubbornly held a narrow advantage all the way to the
wire. LIGHT UP away well and was content to track behind the LAST INNING through the first half mile, started to gain some ground midway on the far turn,
got to the flank of that foe turning for home and battled gamely to the finish only to come up a bit short. ALISO BEACH last out of the gate, was still able to
get into a good rail position early, raced mid-pack to the far turn, entered the stretch in the two path of five across the track, ran on well to the wire but
jumped a shadow and crowded SASSY EINSTEIN near the finish line. SASSY EINSTEIN brushed with DASHING DEMI going into the first turn, raced near
the rear of the field and moved to the rail, was on the inside of a five horse spread entering the stretch, was finishing well when in tight in the final yards.
MOONSHINE CAT angled in for better position after the break, bid from the three-furlong pole, entered the stretch five-wide and was gaining some ground
late but was much too late to be a threat. DASHING DEMI held up after the break and trailed the field down the backstretch, began a sweeping rally past the
half-mile marker, swung six-wide into the stretch and stalled out near the eighth pole. FLIPLIT raced three wide into the first turn, was always in striking
position while still wide to the far turn, made a mild bid from the middle of the turn and tired in the stretch.
