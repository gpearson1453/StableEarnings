Footnotes
TAPE TO TAPE was hustled clear early, continued to set the pace in the three path on the turn while prompted by BASEBALL POLITICS, kicked clear in
upper stretch, maintained a clear lead under a drive midstretch and was hand ridden late. COMISKEY PARK was lightly bumped by CYCLONE ATTACK in
the opening strides, settled at the rear, began to quicken well inside past the five sixteenths, sustained the rally inside in upper stretch, and chased on
willingly to the finish while proving second best. ON K P chased in range early, advanced to join the tracking flight behind TIZ APPROVED while racing in
the two path on the turn, steadied behind the leader near the five sixteenths, was driven three wide in upper stretch, chased on but could not reel in
COMISKEY PARK for the place. LAKE MILLS tracked the leading trio inside early, hugged the rail while chasing the leading foursome around the turn,
chased in range between horses in upper stretch and flattened out past midstretch. RIDING THE TRAIN threw his head at the start, chased inside early, bid
inside of CYCLONE ATTACK in the four path on the turn, swung seven wide into the lane, and kept on mildly past tiring horses. CYCLONE ATTACK was
soundly bumped between horses in the opening strides as a result of TIZ APPROVED breaking inward, settled near the rear early, rallied in tandem outside
of RIDING THE TRAIN in the five path on the turn, floated eight wide into the lane and chased on only mildly. BASEBALL POLITICS was sent for speed
early, caught up to prompt outside of TAPE TO TAPE into the turn, raced in the four to five path outside the leader around the bend, proved no match four
wide into the lane and flattened while drifting out. TIZ APPROVED broke sharply inward and bumped into TOM'S LAST GENERAL, tracked the leading pair,
raced in the five path on the turn outside of ON K P, came six wide into the lane and weakened. TOM'S LAST GENERAL was squeezed hard between
horses in the opening strides due to TIZ APPROVED breaking inward, settled near the rear, raced in the six path on the turn, floated eight wide into the lane
and proved empty. DEMAND RANSOM settled toward the rear, raced in the five path on the turn, swung six wide into the lane and mustered no bid.

Footnotes
FAITHFUL KING was urged to terms with the first flight through the backstretch prompting the pace four deep into the turn, continued to press the issue
while shifting inwards nearing upper stretch, edged forward leaving midstretch and just lasted under firm encouragement. WESLAN was settled between
foes dropping off the first flight racing to the turn, angled out five wide in upper stretch, found his best stride in the closing stages and just failed to edge the
winner at the wire. SNOWMOBILE, urged to the lead while angling inside from the outset, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the bend, disputed the
issue inside the eventual winner into upper stretch and came up empty late. MAN ON ATTACK, urged between foes pressing the pace through the
backstretch into the turn, shifted to the inside in the drive and steadily faded. INDIO GUAPO tracked off the first flight along the inside racing into the bend,
tipped off rail racing into upper stretch, drifted out through the final three sixteenths and offered no rally. NORMANDY ANGEL broke slowly and trailed the
field to the stretch. C V RONIN LEGACY vied with the first flight three wide between foes into the turn, shifted out entering the lane fading from contention,
then steadied momentarily in traffic midstretch and quickly gave out.

Footnotes
MISSION BELLE chased two wide through the first turn, tracked the leading trio two wide down the backstretch, rallied inside of GOOD MONGOLIA
approaching the half, tracked the leading pair while saving ground around the far turn, came two wide into the lane, reeled in STACK SHACK midstretch and
ran on. KATHAAN was keen midpack through the first turn, continued to chase midfield down the back straight, was pushed along three wide on the far turn
and began to improved, swung six wide for the drive, was bumped midstretch by WANDA STRONG but nonetheless kept on willingly to the finish. WANDA
STRONG was sharp out of the gate but settled toward the rear inside, continued toward the rear down the backstretch, chased in the two path on the far
turn, rallied between horses in upper stretch, drifted out a few paths approaching midstretch and bumped into KATHAAN, continued to chase but was
outkicked by that foe for place. STACK SHACK led into the first turn and into the backstretch, was engaged by ROMANTIC ATTACK near the nine
sixteenths, briefly vied inside that foe, edged clear again in the two path on the far turn, took a narrow lead inside into the lane, was headed by MISSION
BELLE approaching the furlong mark and flattened. SEEKING SECA was rank early, took up in the opening furlong when ROMANTIC ATTACK came in on
her, chased inside around the first turn, tracked the leading trio down the back straight inside of MISSION BELLE, chased in the two to three path on the far
turn, was driven inside in upper stretch and lacked the necessary kick. ACCORDING TO ASPEN settled toward the rear, continued near the rear in the two
to three path on the far turn, swung six wide into the lane and drifted a bit further out, but chased on between horses and passed tiring foes. KINGSBURY
DREAM raced outside of CELESTIAL SPIN in the rear pair, continued two wide on the far turn, swung out to the center of the track into the lane and passed
tiring horses mildly. CELESTIAL SPIN raced at the inside of the rear pair, saved ground around the far turn, swung near the center of the track into the lane,
made some mild improvement in upper stretch but ultimately never threatened. GOOD MONGOLIA prompted the pace outside of STACK SHACK early,
stalked around the first turn, continued in range outside of ROMANTIC ATTACK down the back straight, tracked the leading pair from the nine sixteenths
after ROMANTIC ATTACK pulled to join the leader, was driven in the four to five path around the far turn, began to weaken, and had no more in the lane.
ROMANTIC ATTACK came in on SEEKING SECA early, tracked the leading pair, was keen into the backstretch to join inside of GOOD MONGOLIA, pulled
between to engaged outside of STACK SHACK near the nine sixteenths, briefly vied, tracked the leader in the three path around the bend, came five wide
into the lane and emptied out.

Footnotes
KIMBERLY FRANCES was settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, shifted three deep racing into the far turn, continued to gain
some position while caught in close quarters under rating leaving the far turn, split foes three wide entering upper stretch and produced a steady late
response to wrest command and go clear under some right handed pressure. COUGER, urged to the lead along the inside racing into the first turn, dictated
the pace on a comfortable margin to upper stretch, but proved no match when confronted by the winner. WEEKEND PASS settled last along the inside to
the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and displayed some belated interest between rivals in the final sixteenth to prevail for a share. IMAGINE
GOLD tracked the leaders outside a rival in the opening half, was prompted to advance in tandem with the eventual winner while leaning inwards brushing
that rival racing through the far turn, was fanned four wide racing into upper stretch and lacked the needed final kick. SINGING ALLI angled to the inside
tracking the leaders in second flight, saved ground to upper stretch gaining striking distance but faded in late stages. FANCY EMPRESS, urged to a forward
placing just outside the pacesetter racing to the first turn, conceded some position tracking the leader under rating on the backstretch, was urged to advance
racing between foes on the far turn but came up empty racing through the stretch. DARING DAMSEL, restless in the gate before the start, settled outside
foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and offered no rally.

Footnotes
GHAALEB'S DOMAIN broke sharply and soon cleared, set the pace in the two path on the turn, continued on a clear lead into the lane, and reasserted her
advantage under a moderate drive in the final furlong. PALM COURT tracked well off the pacesetter down the backstretch and two wide on the turn, came
into upper stretch in the three to four path, made up a bit of ground on the pacesetter in upper stretch, but could not reel her in and proved a clear second
best under a drive. MAYSTART was bumped by SAMARITA in the opening strides, raced at the rear early, continued at the rear of the main group in the
three to four path on the turn, was driven between foes in upper stretch, and kept on willingly to prove best of the rest. FIELD DAISEY tracked the leader
outside of PALM COURT early, settled back between horses past the five eighths, came three wide into the turn, chased in the four to five path around the
bend, swung into the lane in the eight path for the drive, and chased on mildly past tiring horses. SAMARITA was anxious in the gate, backed out and
reloaded just before the break, broke out and bumped MAYSTART in the opening strides, chased inside foes down the back straight, was pushed along to
track the leader inside of PALM COURT around the turn, was driven inside into the lane and weakened from the three sixteenths. STACY ATTACK chased
between horses down the backstretch, continued toward the rear of the main group in the two to three path on the turn, was driven in the four path in upper
stretch and lacked the needed rally. LORI ATTACK broke with the field and raced three wide in the opening furlong, began to drop back, gradually lost touch
in the four to five path on the turn, and had no response when asked in upper stretch.

Footnotes
LONG TALL WOMAN took up a tracking position three deep on the backstretch, angled to the inside racing into the turn steadily gathering momentum,
tipped out three wide racing into the stretch and produced a steady late response to wrest the advantage in time under energetic handling. RONAN settled
along the inside racing through the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, then switched outside rivals in the closing stages while gaining some late
momentum to close the gap while edging a rival for the place honors. STORMY EMPIRE, off a step behind the pacesetter, was hustled up the rail in the
opening quarter prompting that rival into the turn, dueled for command past midstretch but couldn't match the winner's final kick while just missing for
second. DELIGHTFUL BREEZE broke sharply, angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn, pressed the issue into
upper stretch but yielded leaving the furlong marker. PALAGO, off a step slowly, then bumped at the start, was collected while settling last, switched outside
foes racing into the stretch but offered no rally. ORNERY ANGEL settled outside foes in early stages and failed to mount a serious challenge. RAP STAR
broke outwards bumping PALAGO at the start, was urged to gain a forward placing tracking just off the leaders racing to the turn, was fanned four wide into
upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
SHARP HERO broke sharply, tracked the leading pair down the back straight while racing a bit keen, tracked three wide on the turn, engaged outside of
PLUS CHIC approaching the five sixteenths, swung out to the six path into the lane, took the lead approaching the furlong pole and cleared under a hand
ride. PLUS CHIC stumbled out of the gate and bumped into DOROTA while gathering back up, disputed the early pace outside of ISABELLACANNETELLA,
asserted a clear lead into the turn while positioned two wide, was engaged by SHARP HERO to her outside approaching the five sixteenths, maintained a
narrow lead into upper stretch but was headed by SHARP HERO approaching midstretch, and chased on a clear second best. STOPSHOPPINGAMY
settled toward the rear early, was pushed along in the four path on the turn, swung out into the lane in the seven path, and chased on mildly to prove best of
the rest. ISABELLACANNETELLA was sent for pace inside, disputed the early lead inside of PLUS CHIC, did not go with that foe into the turn, tracked while
saving ground, came into the lane in the two to three path under a drive, briefly engaged inside of PLUS CHIC in upper stretch but flattened out in the final
furlong. GO MADI GO settled at the rear, raced in the three path on the turn, swung out into the lane in the seven to eight path and lacked the needed rally.
DOROTA was bumped by PLUS CHIC in the opening strides, chased inside early, flattened into the turn, raced in the two to three path around the bend,
was driven in the three path in upper stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT broke readily, prompted the pace inside rivals racing into the bend, took over racing into upper stretch and made the balance of the
pace under brisk handling. FRIEND, restless in the gate, was urged between rivals from the outset disputing the pace through the backstretch, edged
forward to a narrow advantage midway through the bend, drifted out to the four path racing through the stretch and proved no match for the winner in the
drive. JAMAICAN TRAFFIC was rated between foes off the first flight to the turn, angled to the rail racing into upper stretch and kept on well enough to earn
a share. QUEEN EKATI, caught six wide dropping off the second flight racing through the backstretch into the turn, was fanned seven wide into upper
stretch but continued with some mild interest to gain some position. FROST WARRIOR ducked out, then was taken in hand at the start, was prompted to
regain contention inside foes, then came under some rating nearing the bend, shifted off the inside racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick.
TAP N TWINE was off a step slowly, then taken up avoiding close quarters at the break, settled inside foes racing into the bend, shifted out entering the
lane but passed only tiring rivals after her rider lost his whip. MORNING LINE NEWS tracked the leaders as part of the second flight racing five between
foes to the turn and offered no rally. BELLS OF JOY tracked off the first flight leading the second flight four wide between foes into the turn but steadily
faded into upper stretch. GOSHEN GIRL was urged three deep from the break pressing the pace through the backstretch, drifted out racing into the turn and
abruptly gave way.
