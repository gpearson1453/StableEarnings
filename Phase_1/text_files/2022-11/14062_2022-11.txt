Footnotes
NO HUDDLE was allowed to settle in stride while racing three-wide, came six-wide into the stretch, angled in to split rivals during the drive and was up late
to win going away. JAMIE CAN'T DANCE sprinted clear early, drifted out nearing the quarter pole and into the stretch, responded when straightened and
held on gamely for the place. BALD IS BEAUTIFUL prompted the pace from along the inside and continued on well for the show in a good effort.
DISTORTED GUY was forwardly placed early and weakened during the drive. CLOWN OIL saved ground while being unhurried and failed to seriously
threaten. CASH CRUZER was not a factor while racing two-wide. JON L hesitated and then hopped at the start to get away behind his field and was unable
to recover the lost ground.
