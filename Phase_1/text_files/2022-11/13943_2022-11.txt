went to the front, was overtaken and held for second. WHERE'S THE GOLD trailed the field and offered a late bid. RYANWATER steadied shifting out
abruptly leaving the opening turn to avoid fallen rider, and lacked a bid. VISION QUEST lost rider leaving the first turn, did not finish and was walked off.

up through the stretch. ROTTEN TO THE CORE trailed the field early, took closer order nearing the quarter pole, rallied late narrowly getting up for place.
BEAUTIFUL BABE rallied late and was bested for place. ENTITLED STAR stalked the pace four wide, lodged bid between foes into the stretch and
weakened late. TALA led the field through the backstretch, was brushed entering the lane and yielded. BABS DELIGHT chased the pace from just off the

FAMOUS LAST WORDS sat in striking position while four wide, overtook the lead at the five sixteenth marker, and opened up through stretch. SMOKIN
JOY raced in close quarters into the opening turn, and improved in stretch but was no match for the winner. STARMA away well then was allowed to settle
off the early pace, drifted in off the final turn brushing the rail and yielded. MONETARY MISHAP sent for early speed then angled towards the rail quickly,
was overtaken in the turn and faded steadily.

Footnotes
THESHACK rated off the pace from the two path, swung five wide into the final turn, rallied three wide and got by in time. BOITANO raced at the back of the
pack while widest through the backstretch, went in pursuit of the leaders approaching the three eighth marker prompting action, moved up alongside
ZICATELA into the stretch, was out finished and finished second best. ZICATELA outsprinted leaving the opening turn, tracked the pacesetters in the four
path, dueled inside of BOITANO, and was bested late. TACOFLAVOREDKISSES unhurried early, hustled under urging nearing the quarter pole and lacked
a kicked that was needed. SPORTSCARR contested the early pace outside, held a slim advantage leaving the backstretch, and gave way inside with two
furlongs remaining. GRAY ADMIRAL lacked a bid. NORTHERN DREAMIN pressed the early pace inside of SPORTSCARR, and stopped.

Footnotes
WHISKARITA trailed the field early, circled into the lane, closed steadily outside and was up in time. FLORAL settled outside in the backstretch, gained
outside into the final turn, moved up alongside PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE to challenge the lead, wore down rival and was edged out late by WHISKARITA.
PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE sped to the front then led the field through the backstretch, responded to challenge from FLORAL into the stretch, and gave way
grudgingly inside in the final yards. A LOT OF SPUNK saved ground from rail, drove five wide into the lane, and lacked the kick needed. QUICK DIAL sat in
striking distance while in the four path, and faded gradually with two furlongs remaining. GO MAMA stalked the pace in the three path, and tired along the
rail. THERUFFSIDEOFEXHI lost rider leaving, did not finish and was walked off. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of
the race involving THERUFFSIDEOFEXHI. After review the Board of Stewards determined there was insufficient evidence from the film and all wagers on
THERUFFSIDEOFEXHI will be refunded.

Footnotes
OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR reserved off the early pacesetters, shifted outside into the final turn, and won going away. COSMIC MARINE vied outside of
BLAZING CHANNING leaving the chute, disposed of rival leaving the backstretch, and was rundown mid stretch finishing second best. KISS AWAY stalked
the pacesetters in the four path, angled to the rail into the far turn, and gave way in stretch. BEAUGATTI lost irons leaving the gate, regained irons at the
head of the lane, and passed tiring rival. TINY TYCOON pressed the pace while five wide, and tired early. BLAZING CHANNING contested the pace and
was through early.
