Footnotes
CHROMEPLATED HEART was sent from the outside to set the early pace and held well to be well clear under steady pressure. AWESOME LAWSON was
bumped at the start, rated to race in hand from the inside, angled near the five sixteenths pole and rallied well late from the outside of rivals. LOOKS DON'T
LIE stalked the pace, raced between near the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. MIRANDA'S DESMOND was bumped soundly at the start, chased the
pace from the inside, continued an inside bid near the quarter pole and faded. GHOSTLY NIGHT raced mid pack early on, was shuffled back from the inside
into the far turn and made a good late gain. YIRA raced off the early pace and made a belated rally while racing between rivals. MUSIC QUEEN chased the
pace while racing four wide early and was empty late. AMERICAS WOMAN was off slowly, raced near the rail past the half mile pole, angled five wide and
had no final bid. DURA THE EXPLORER raced near the back of the pack early on, angled in to race along the inside around the far turn into the stretch and
never was a factor. SIDNEY SUE was up close, raced four to five wide and faded.

effort. DEVILISH AFFAIR was off step slow, dropped back early, moved up between near the five sixteenths pole, angled five wide and finished willingly to
the wire. FLAVA'S DREAM was bumped at the start, raced from the inside near the quarter pole, angled out and finished willingly to the wire. BETCHA BY
GOLLY was bumped at the start, raced keen early while pulling between rivals and weakened a bit through the drive. SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL stalked the
pace from the inside and weakened. APPALACHIANHEIGHTS raced four deep through the far turn and never was a factor. CALYPSO GHOST showed
good early foot from the inside to set the early pace and tired readily.

encouragement. GLOSSAMER raced along from the inside, waited briefly near the quarter pole, worked between rivals in the drive and finished gamely to
the wire. DIXIE CANNON showed good early foot to set the pace along the inside and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. POUNDING MUSIC stalked
the early pace, checked while racing between foes near the five eighths pole, moved up from the outside around the far turn, raced five wide near the three
sixteenths pole and kept on to the wire. MO FIRE was unhurried early on, raced four to three between rivals in the stretch run and raced evenly with no
closing run. MISQUILLO raced off the early going, raced along the inside through the far turn and moved up to improve position. PLEASE MARRY ME
prompt the pace from the outside and faded. FOXTROT SEVILLE was slow early, raced from the outside around the far turn through the stretch and lacked
a rally. HOT CHOICE dropped back early on, was three deep near the quarter pole, angled out and never threatened. KEMBA raced three wide early,

Footnotes
IMAGINTHEKISS showed good early foot to set his own pace and drew off to be well clear under steady pressure. TAP N GLO dropped back early moved
up through the far turn and finished well to rally for the place position late. POET IN MY HEART stalked the pace, raced near the rail around the far turn into
the upper stretch and kept on willingly to the wire. TIPSY TOURIST raced off the early pace, angled in down the backstretch, was along the inside into the
upper stretch and moved up to improve position. SEEMS TO WHISPER stalked the pace, moved up to challenge near the quarter pole and weakened while
racing three to four wide. TILTED TIARA stalked the pace, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and had no late response.. I HAVE COURAGE
raced with the second flight early on, advanced in the drive but was never a serious threat. SERIOUS MOMENT raced off the early pace, was three to four
wide around the far turn and lacked a bid. MYRA FLEENER dropped back early, raced seven deep from the outside of foes into the upper stretch and never
threatened. TANKA TOUGH raced mid pack early on, was three deep near the quarter pole and had no late response. PINK DAISY was off slowly, raced
four deep around the far turn and never menaced. ASHARA was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, stopped and was eased up on late.

Footnotes
ROCKET ONE showed good early foot to set a narrow lead outside of foe, took command near the half mile pole and held a clear margin under steady
pressure. DRAKON stalked the pace along the inside, angled out nearing the five sixteenths pole and rallied for the place position from the outside.
HELLMAN broke in at the start, rated to race just off the early pace, raced three deep near the quarter pole and gave way grudgingly. TATE settled off the
early going, angled out to race four deep near the quarter pole and made a good late gain. PURSUING PACE was off a step slow, raced near the inside
past the quarter pole, split rivals nearing the eighth and raced evenly with no final run. BOLD LICORICE raced inside around the far turn and had no late
rally. VANHOOFER stumbled at the break, dropped to the back of the pack early, raced from the inside past the half mile pole, continued an inside bid
through the far turn and never threatened. MR. CONNECTICUT raced of the early going, circled five wide around the far turn and tired. RESILIENT
COURAGE pressed the pace from the inside and faded. GOD IS LOVE dropped back early and failed to respond. HIDDEN ROD tired readily and was
distanced. BAIL OUT was pulled up nearing the five eighths pole and walked off the track under his own power.

Footnotes
VICTIM OF THE NITE had a poor start, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start, advanced into the far turn, made a four wide bid near the quarter
pole and drew clear late finishing strongly under steady handling. BILLYKUS showed good early foot to set the early pace, clear near the eighth pole but
was no match for the winner late. ELUSIVE IMAGE was fractious behind the gate, settled to race mid pack early on, moved up from the inside around the
far turn, angled five wide and made a good late gain. ON THE MARK chased the pace from the inside and weakened through the drive. IMAGINE A CURE
stalked the pace from the outside, raced two wide between near the five sixteenths pole and weakened. JONES FALLS raced off the early pace, was three
to four wide around the far turn and lacked a rally. PRINCE OF HOPS settled early, raced four wide deep near the three eighths pole, six deep through the
upper stretch and lacked a bid. HE'S ON FIRE was forwardly placed to lay up close early while racing between rivals and faded. BEST CHOICE BABY was
off slowly, raced along the inside at the quarter pole, angled out to race wide in the stretch and never threatened.
