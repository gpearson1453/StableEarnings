DON'T GET PICKLED was void of any early speed, advanced between rivals stretch, angled out, took control late and edged clear for the win. COUNTESS
OF CAIRO set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turns, met the bid of EDDIES ON PATROL, dueled briefly with that rival, continued on,
couldn't hold off winner and finished second best. EDDIE'S ON PATROL tracked the early pace, ranged up four wide through the second turn and
weakened late stretch. PHOENICIAN MAGIC was allowed to settle early from the inside, angled out through the drive and flattened out. ISLAND BEAUTY
pressed the early pace, went three wide into the turns and was finished early. MAMBO GIRL outrun early, went six wide through the turn and was empty
late. WE WANT ANOTHER was taken back early, went seven wide into the turn and never fired. Hand timed.

Footnotes
PUBLIC OPINION was allowed to settle early, raced between rivals into the final turn, waited for room angled out, was gaining fast, took control late and
edged clear. MY MAN BIGGIE raced in mid pack early, advanced five wide through the second turn, drifted in, made a bid on WESTERBERG, shook clear
from that rival couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best. WESTERBERG set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the home turn, met
the bid of BIG SANDY in mid stretch, dueled briefly and weakened late. MICKEY GOLDMILL was taken back early, raced six wide into the second turn and
assed tired rivals. MISTER MAFIOSO was outrun early from between rivals and was finished early. ANGELA'S ANGEL was rushed from the inside, made a
middle move along the backstretch, and faded. KNOCKOUT GUY was taken back, raced off the rail and never fired. MY SWEET LORD was outrun early,
raced seven wide through the second turn and was no factor. BIG SANDY was hustled early from the inside and gave way. JOHN'S KID followed the early
pace and was finished early.
