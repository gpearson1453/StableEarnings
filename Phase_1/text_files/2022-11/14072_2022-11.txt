Footnotes
ALLERGIC TO LOGIC raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two
path coming around the far turn and kicked clear in the lane. MS. LEA raced in the three path around the first turn, settled off the pace for the run up the
backstretch, saved ground around the second bend and gained ground from the rail late. INDIAN EXCELLENCE raced in the two path in the early going,
continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses, launched a bid from the three path approaching the quarter pole and was outkicked
in the final furlong. BLUE LUNA WHO saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the
two path and weakened in the lane. GOSPEL GINA led the way from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground
around the far turn and faded in the stretch. LA DIAMANT raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack
on the outside, came around the far turn in the three path and was empty from there. LEMON ICE reared up leaving the gate, trailed the field throughout
and was not a factor. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE START. UPON REVIEW, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT HORSE FOUR, LEMON
ICE, HAD A FAIR START AND NO CHANGES WERE MADE.

THE LIDS OFF led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the two path coming around the turn, dug in gamely in the lane and just
held off a late closer to the wire. READS PET ZENON raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid
while racing four wide around the turn, and gained ground to the wire but could not go by the winner. RAFAEL'S SURPRISE raced off the pace on the
outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and gained ground late. UNBRIDLED OPTIMIST chased the leader up the backstretch,
came around the turn in the three path and finished evenly. NOGAL CANYON settled in the middle of the pack on the inside in the early going, saved
ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and flattened out in the lane. GEEBEESBIGBOY raced in the middle of the pack between
horses up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the four path and was empty in the stretch. GRIFTER trailed the field on the inside up the
backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and made no bid.

ZACH WHO was away from the gate sharply, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three and four path around the turn, began a
bid approaching the quarter pole, dueled down the lane and got up for the win late. LET THERE BE PEACE led the field between horses up the backstretch,
continued to show the way from the three path around the turn, swung wide into the stretch and dueled to the wire, giving way grudgingly in the final strides.
I AM GRODD raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the two and three path and
gained ground through the final furlong. DON HOLLYWOOD hit the gate and the horse next to him at the start, trailed well behind the field up the
backstretch and around the turn, entered the stretch in the two path and improved position steadily to the wire. BOOM BOOM DADDY bumped with the
horse to his outside leaving the gate, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and never fired. WEST
TEXAS COWBOY tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faded in the lane. EL OCHO raced in the middle of
the pack on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch. INDIANOFGOLD raced at the back of the pack through the
opening stages, saved ground around the turn and made no bid.

Footnotes
MISS FLUFFY led the way on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and drew off in the lane. HANNAH'S HIGHLIFE chased
the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, could not go with the winner in the
stretch and kept on to the wire. OLIVIADIDIT raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two and three path and gained
ground in late stretch. IMAMONEYMAKER pressed the pace from the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, dueled from the three path around the
turn and weakened in the final furlong. DESERT PEPPER settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and
was empty in the lane. CHAMA STORM trailed the field up the backstretch, began a bid from the five path coming around the turn, swung wider still entering
the stretch and never threatened. PANDORA WHO raced off the pace on the inside through the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and made no
bid. MY TEXAS GIRL was reluctant to load, broke well and tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the two
path around the turn and tired further in the stretch.

HENNESSY'S SQUIRT led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the two path coming around the turn and dug in gamely in the stretch to hold the win.
INDY'S SONG raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two and three path and gained ground late.
KISS ME D ORO pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming around the turn, dueled in upper stretch and
weakened in the final sixteenth of a mile. MASTERCLASS stalked the pace setter on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the four
path around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, improved position down the stretch and was outfinished late. AMERICAN SOLO chased the
leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faded in the stretch. LONZO WHO hit the gate leaving it, trailed the field up the
backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and was empty from there. RIG RIDER raced off the pace on the outside early, came around the turn in
the three path, swung wide into the stretch and made no bid.
