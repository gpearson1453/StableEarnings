Footnotes
FLATOUT WINNER tracked between horses on the clubhouse turn, was keen between horses into the backstretch, began to engage outside of WHISKEY
PLANK near the five eighths, continued to attend in the three path on the far turn, joined the leader on even terms near the five sixteenths, continued to vie
into upper stretch, cleared near the three sixteenth, was driven through midstretch and finished under a hand ride late. TWOKO BAY settled at the rear,
raced at the inside of the rear pair down the back straight, continued at the rear of the main group in the two path on the far turn, came into the lane inside,
altered out for room in upper stretch, and proved best of the rest under a drive between horses. WHISKEY PLANK led inside into the clubhouse turn, raced
clear into the backstretch, was confronted by FLATOUT WINNER near the five eighths and set a pressured pace from there, was headed by that foe near
the five sixteenths while racing in the two path, vied to upper stretch but was no match from the three sixteenths, was driven between late and weakened.
FIRST MASAMUNE was keen early, raced three wide in range around the clubhouse turn and into the backstretch, settled back to chase nearing the far
turn, chased in the four path around that bend, offered a brief bid near the five sixteenths when pushed along, came five wide into the lane and could not
sustain his bid. IOYA AGAIN tracked inside, continued to track the leading pair in the two path on the far turn, was urged two wide in upper stretch and
flattened. DYNABLUE shook his head and broke slowly, chased three wide around the clubhouse turn, settled back to the rear pair approaching the
backstretch, raced toward the rear of a close-knit pack, flattened in the three to four path around the far turn and had no response in the lane.

Footnotes
HARMON KILLER BREW, urged to a forward placing four wide racing to the backstretch, was prompted to make a steady advance in that path through the
far turn to challenge for command racing into upper stretch and drove clear. KEEN RESPONSE tracked off the first flight four wide between foes racing into
the first turn, continued in that path on the backstretch, shifted out five wide racing into upper stretch and continued with late interest to edge a rival for the
place honors. KING ZION, urged setting the pace on a narrow advantage a bit off the rail racing to the backstretch, dueled for command inside foes into
upper stretch but proved no match for the winner while losing second late. BON DEUX prompted the pace between foes in the opening half, pressed the
issue into the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. MEMPHIS THEPROPHET, off slowly, was urged through tight quarters while angling to the inside
racing into the first turn, pulled a bit against rating racing just inside the pacesetter to the far turn but came up empty in the drive. DARREN'S LEGACY, held
up avoiding tight quarters along the rail nearing the first turn, never gained contention. KENKEAD, caught five wide racing through the first turn, retreated
early.

BEYOND PROPER chased inside through the clubhouse turn, improved to track the leading pair down the backstretch, engaged outside the leading pair
three wide past the three eighths, took the lead between horses into upper stretch, shook clear when driven midstretch and drew off. SUMMER DAY settled
near the rear early, continued at the rear of the main group down the back straight, began to take closer order inside foes near the five eighths, tipped out
four wide near the three eighths and sustained her rally to engage the leading flight, raced into the lane four wide in range, was outkicked by BEYOND
PROPER from upper stretch but chased on second best. SHE'S A BIG STAR attended the pace outside of STACY ATTACK, took the lead outside that foe
near the three eighths, was headed into the lane by BEYOND PROPER, proved no match but chased on to hold a share. STORMY EMPIRE chased
between horses through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, chased in the four to five path on the far turn, was driven in the five path in upper
stretch, and chased on mildly. MOON PIES IMAGE soon trailed, continued at the rear in the four to five path around the far turn, swung out to the six to
seven path into the lane, and rallied mildly. STACY ATTACK set a pressured pace inside of SHE'S A BIG STAR, was headed near the three eighths by that
foe, turned for home in range inside of that foe and weakened. SWEET FRAULEIN chased three wide around the clubhouse turn, settled back near the rear
of the main group down the back straight, saved ground on the far turn and had no rally in the lane. SHINE DOWN broke through the gate and unseated her
rider but was almost immediately apprehended, loaded back in the gate, tracked the leading pair outside of WANDA STRONG, flattened four wide down the
backstretch, continued to flatten out in the three path on the turn and proved empty. WANDA STRONG tracked the leading pair inside of SHINE DOWN

Footnotes
LORD DYLAN, angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight in the opening stages, was held up conceding position avoiding close
quarters entering the bend, saved ground to upper stretch, then steadily gained along the rail nearing the furlong marker, took over approaching the
sixteenth marker and went clear under pressure. LAPIS LAZULI, bumped from both sides, then shuffled back at the start, settled last to the stretch, then
tipped out to split foes four wide and found his best stride late to prove best of the others. K C'S FIRST B M W, urged between foes prompting the
pacesetter through the backstretch, lost some ground to that foe on the turn, continued three deep between foes into the stretch, but weakened late.
JOHNNY UP came through close quarters at the break to track off the first flight three wide between foes racing to the turn, shifted inwards while racing in
close quarters entering the stretch and finished evenly inside rivals late. MUD ISLAND was urged setting the pace on a narrow advantage racing a bit off the
rail into the turn, widened the advantage nearing the lane, then faltered leaving midstretch. BIRDIE MACHINE, bumped at the start, was urged to contend
three deep with the first flight in the opening stages, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and gave way. DEORA STORE tracked the leaders four wide in
second flight racing into the turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and steadily faded. ASTI SKY, bumped at the start, tracked off the first flight
between foes racing into the turn and steadily faded in the drive.

Footnotes
FORWARD CURVE set the pace into the clubhouse turn, took mild prompting from COSME past the five eighths shook off that foe into the far turn and
raced clear on the rail, began to open up further when shaken up in upper stretch, and continued to increase his advantage while kept to task. BIG BLUE
chased behind the tracking flight through the first turn and down the back straight, chased three wide around the far turn and into upper stretch, was no
match for FORWARD CURVE but kept on best of the rest. KEEP ATTACKING was washy before the race, raced two wide in the rear pair, was pushed
along two wide around the far turn, swung five wide into the lane and chased on mildly. KANITHAPPEN raced keenly in range inside into the clubhouse
turn, continued to track the leading pair while still racing keenly down the back straight, was pushed along while saving ground around the far turn, came
into the lane in the two path, could not reel in FORWARD CURVE and flattened. OFF TO THE BEACH settled in the rear pair inside of KEEP ATTACKING,
was pushed along while hugging the rail on the far turn, swung four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. COSME tracked the pacesetter outside of
KANITHAPPEN around the first turn, prompted mildly outside of FORWARD CURVE past the five eighths, was no match for FORWARD CURVE into the far
turn, tracked in the three path around the bend, came into the lane between horses and emptied out. DUE TO AN EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTION PHOTO

Footnotes
TWIRLING ROSES tracked the pacesetter four deep as part of the second flight racing through the backstretch into the turn, then made steady progress in
that path in the stretch and surged to lead late, narrowly prevailing in time under firm handling. KIERKEGAARD tracked the pacesetter three wide between
foes in the opening stages, continued between foes through the turn to upper stretch, shifted out to bid three wide between foes leaving the sixteenth
marker and was just outkicked. BIG SPORT broke sharply, dictated the pace on a clear margin in the two path into the turn, held sway off the rail into upper
stretch, resisted the top pair to late stages but just failed to contain those rivals. ROMAN PHAROAH tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight on
the backstretch, was eased back from that position while switching to the outside entering the turn, swung five wide racing into upper stretch, then shifted
inwards under pressure while finishing evenly late. RICHIESGOTSWAGGER tracked the pacesetter inside foes as part of the second flight racing into the
bend, saved ground to upper stretch but faded in the drive. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY settled last on the backstretch while switching outside a rival racing into
the turn but never proved a serious threat. JACK'S ADVANTAGE dropped out early.

Footnotes
BLAZEN ROAD raced at the inside of the leading flight into the first turn while attended by DREAM KEEPER outside, cleared into the backstretch, saved
ground on the lead around the far turn while reengaged by DREAM KEEPER, led narrowly into upper stretch, stayed on gamely under a drive down the lane
and held sway. DREAM KEEPER raced two wide in the leading flight around the first turn, tracked the leader down the back straight, reengaged two wide
on the far turn, was driven into to the lane in range in the three to four path, drifted out, kept chasing to the finish but ultimately could not find enough to reel
BLAZEN ROAD in. PATH TO SUCCESS tracked the leading pair, inched forward inside of DREAM KEEPER past the five eighths, tracked the leading pair
in the two path on the far turn, offered a grinding rally between horses in the final furlong and missed. PROMISING SHOES settled near the rear, raced
inside of PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN in the rear flight around the far turn in the three path, swung into the lane in the six path, found his best in the final
sixteenth, and narrowly missed four wide. HAPPY CAMPER chased midfield, was pushed along in the four path on the far turn, and chased on evenly while
drifting out in the lane. PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN settled at the rear, raced in the four path on the far turn outside of PROMISING SHOES, offered mild
belated improvement while drifting out in the lane but ultimately proved no threat. BUREAU settled toward the rear of a strung-out field early, inched forward
inside of HAPPY CAMPER near the nine sixteenths, chased toward the rear in the three path on the far turn and had no rally when driven in the lane.

Footnotes
SOUPER FORTUNE exchanged light contact with EL ASESINO at the start, was urged between foes to wrest the advantage after the opening furlong,
moved clear racing to the turn while angling to the inside, held sway on a clear margin to upper stretch and was kept to firm right handed encouragement.
HATCHET CREEK, urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter from the outset into the bend, switched outside rivals racing into the stretch and
continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. SIR ACEALOT was rated off the second flight along the inside through the backstretch to the turn,
angled out nearing midstretch and improved his placing four wide late. THREE TIME CHARMER tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the
turn, angled four wide into upper stretch and finished evenly late. EL ASESINO exchanged brushes with the eventual winner at the start, was urged between
rivals pursuing the pacesetter into the turn and gave way in the drive. AWESOME FAMILY settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the turn and never
proved a serious threat. DEVIL'S RULE broke readily, was urged four wide, then three wide into the turn pursuing the pacesetter to midstretch and gave out
late. WILLOW RIDGE settled between foes in the last flight early, angled to the rail nearing the turn, saved ground to the lane but proved no threat.
RICHIESONARAMPAGE broke slowly, settled between foes, was taken up avoiding tight quarters nearing the three furlong marker and quickly dropped out.
RUBY'S RED DEVIL, refused to leave the starting stalls after the gates opened despite prompting from his rider. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
