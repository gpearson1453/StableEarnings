Footnotes
HOOSIER PREMIUM stalked the dueling pacesetters from the three path through the turn, bid from the three path into the lane, caught the leader near the
eighth pole then drove clear and widened. QUITE WHIMSICAL vied inside, cleared in mid-turn, briefly dueled with the winner to the eighth pole then was no
match while finishing clear for the place spot. CORIMA vied for the early lead while two wide, could not keep up into the turn, chased the leaders into the
lane then weakened. LITTLE ACCOUNT was along the inside through the turn and into the lane and steadily lost ground. SHINY SHOES never a factor
while in the three path through the turn and into the lane.

Footnotes
TUFFER THAN TUFF was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, bid near the rail through the lane and edged up late. BLUEMOON JUSTICE was
unhurried while along the inside through the turn, angled into the five path into the lane then rallied from the five path. METALLIC MAN set the pace along
the inside through the turn, was still clear with an eighth to go then yielded to the top ones late. DANANG was off slowly and spotted the field some three
lengths, raced in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and finished willingly. MR MANNING chased the pace from the two
path through the turn, had aim on the leader into the lane and lacked a bid. SACRED SKY was off alertly to lead early, pressed the pace two wide through
the turn then weakened in the lane. TOPPING never was a factor while along the inside. TOUCHOFCHILIPEPPER was in the two path through the turn and
was done entering the lane.

extended the advantage through the lane while being ridden out. DOUBLE ADVANTAGE chased the pace from the three path through the turn and into the

threat. BOOTDADDY JUSTICE chased the pace along the inside through the turn then faded through the lane. EL BOHEMIO trailed throughout while along

Footnotes
MARIACHI JUSTICE pressed the pace two wide through the turn, bid into the lane from the three or four path, cleared outside the eighth pole then slowly
widened to the end. JENNY'S BEIGNET chased the pace from the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and moved up to be
second best while not a serious threat to the winner. OUTSTANDINGJUSTICE tracked the pace along the inside through the turn, raced in the two path
down the lane and was up for the show spot late. RACING IN MY HEART set the pace from the two path while under pressure into the lane then gave way.
NINE POINTER raced near the inside down the backstretch, was steadied and shifted into the four path approaching the turn when lacking room, raced
through the turn in the four path and never was a menace. GENERAL AFFAIR raced in the three path through the turn when near the back, came into the
lane from the six path and never factored. STARSPANGLEDIMAGE never a factor while in the two path. BENITO was outrun while along the inside.

CHELSEA'S STRENGTH pressed the early pace outside of the leader, dueled outside and prevailed under mild urging. NEVER TO MANY HUGS was clear

stalked the pace in the five path, bid at the three-eighths pole but couldn't close in the stretch. CATCHAFALLNSTAR passed tired foes. TIZ ABBY was off
awkwardly, raced four wide and passed tired rivals. PRIME N PROPER saved ground to no avail. IWANNABEPERFECT was through early inside.

Footnotes
ALLIE MAES REVENGE led inside, drew off in the stretch and held sway under mild urging before gearing down late. DARNELL raced in the three path,
chased the winner through the stretch but was no match. LIZZSAIDNO raced in the four path and gained the show spot late. LILMISS SASSYPANTS
pressed the pace outside of the leader, bid at the three-eighths pole but gave way in the stretch. MRSINATRAGLORYLADY stalked the pace inside before
fading on the turn. NUTHER BEE raced evenly in the three path. CHOCOLATE TRUTH and AMA LUCY were not factors.
