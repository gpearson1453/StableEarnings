Footnotes
GLASS STAR was hard held while prompting the pace from inside, took the lead around the turn, opened up into the lane, and won handily. TOO MUCH
VINO raced from wellback in the four path, was roused while swinging out to the six path into the stretch, and ran on down the center for place. PRINCIPIA
brushed the right side of the gate, tracked from the six path, shifted into the three path going into the stretch, and kept on for show. MISS GRAND SLAM
bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed from three path into stretch, but was one paced. MILK MONEY set the pace from two wide but yielded midway
around the turn. WICKLOW GAL chased from the seven path but was no menace. EXAGERADORA bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked from the
four path early but backed up along the inside around the turn.

Footnotes
HIERRO set a pressured pace in the two and three paths, continued on the left lead in the lane and just lasted. DOUBLE TOUGH TIGER reared just prior to
the gates opening and was off several lengths behind the field, advanced two wide around the turn and finished gamely inside of the winner to just missed.
CAUSALISTIC saved ground off the pace, bid inside of the winner in midstretch and was outkicked. TONE FEELIN pressed the pace outside of the winner
in the three and four paths and tired in the lane. ONE EYED JACK raced off the pace three wide and had no response. CATCHING FISH had brief speed
four wide. GRAY HOPE was outrun while racing two wide. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND TOOK NO ACTION.

lane, and drew clear. CONFER chased from the four path, bid while being hustled along from three wide around the turn, drifted out to the five path in upper
stretch, and kept on to place. ADELIESE'S SMILE dueled between rivals, took a narrow lead from the two path rounding the turn, but finished evenly in the
stretch for show. UNIFIED GURL bumped an inner foe at the start, was held up in the three path, swung out to the six path going into the stretch, but
flattened. MISS M M dueled from three wide but faded at the top of the lane. LIPARI trailed into the stretch and was eased. SECRET SAMARITAN dueled
from inside but gave way early around the turn.

Footnotes
WORA stalked the pace two wide between foes, split foes three wide in midstretch and drove clear. SPEEDY HANS tracked the pace three and four wide
and ran on for the place. UNCLE B dueled along the rail inside of DISCREET TUNE, won that battle but was outfinished by the top two. DISCREET TUNE
pressed the pace two wide, took the lead in upper stretch and weakened through the final furlong. LUCAGO chased the pace inside and lacked a closing
bid. SPEARGUN was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
STRIKE JAK led from the two path, was coaxed midway around the turn, opened up into the lane, began to shorten stride in closing stages, and just held
on. VAI BELLA chased from the three path, was ridden along while swinging out to the six path turning into the stretch, and rallied late but just missed to
place. SOUPER TROPICAL tracked from the five path, was driven from the seven path going into the lane, and kept on down the center for show. LUNA
TUNA stalked in the three path, tucked in around the turn, tipped back out to the three path into the stretch, but was one paced. CUMBERLAND FALLS
prompted the pace from the four path early but faded in the stretch. SEVEN P'S raced from wellback inside and was no factor. GREAT ANALOGY started
slowly, trailed into the stretch, and was never a threat. FOR THE THRILL rated from the two path but never menaced.

Footnotes
KITTY QUICK stalked from inside, tipped out to bid two wide around the turn, led into the final furlong, and cleared. MAMA MARIA set the pace from the two
path, was coaxed from inside into the lane, and dug in but was second best. GUARDIAN ANGEL bumped with an outer foe, raced in midpack from the two
path, tucked in around the turn, was roused from the three path into the lane, but finished evenly for show. BROWN EYED BEAUTY bumped with an inner
foe, chased in the five path, swung out to the seven path into the stretch, but was one paced. FORTUNA BELLE bumped with an outer foe, tracked in the
three path, took aim from the four path around the turn, but faded in the stretch. STARSHIP SUNRISE bumped with an inner foe, was held up in the five
path, cut the corner into the lane, but flattened. OMO TEN GIRL broke out at the start, raced in midfield from the two path but was empty. ZOSTEROP rated
from the four path but was no factor. MOHAWK TRAIL raced from wellback in the two path but was no menace. MY INSANITY was bumped and squeezed
at the start and never threatened.

Footnotes
LOVELORN LADY settled off the early pace while racing six wide around the first turn, advanced four wide around the far turn, took over nearing the eighth
pole, drew clear leaving that marker and lasted. CRYSTAL COAST raced off the pace four wide between foes early, angled to the rail nearing the far turn,
advanced inside around the bend, swung out near the eighth pole, continued on the left lead and finished well between foes. KHOSEA raced five wide
between foes in midpack early, continued five wide around the far turn, was bumped in upper stretch and rallied for the show. TIZ ENOUGH broke a bit
awkwardly, raced off the pace two wide and rallied belatedly between foes. GRANDMA'S PUDDING was in range two wide early, went four wide between
foes around the far turn, bumped with KHOSEA in upper stretch, lacked a clear path in the final eighth and had only a mild gain. BRITTIZ dueled in the two
path inside a foe to midstretch and weakened. EXTRAVAGANT ROSIE tracked the pace three and four wide and faded in the lane. HARDLY SOCIAL failed
to menace while racing four and five wide. L. E. GRAY was pulling early, dueled in the three path, led around the far turn and tired in the lane. ISLA BONITA
was outrun inside.

Footnotes
SUPER SPREADER chased in the two path, tipped out to take aim from the four path into the stretch, and rallied in the final furlong to draw clear. SMOOTH
MOTION hopped at the start, rated from inside, was cued from four wide around the far turn, led briefly entering the final furlong and ran on for place.
COALMINER'S KITTEN tracked from inside, was ridden along while swinging out to the six path going into the lane, drifted out, and kept on for show. NAPA
DUDE led from inside, opened up around the far turn, but yielded late. SMART N SHARP prompted the pace while two wide, was coaxed from the three
path into the far turn, but finished evenly in the stretch. PRESTON MURRAY stalked from three wide early but faded turning into the stretch.
IMDABESTINTHEWORLD trailed throughout from the four path.
