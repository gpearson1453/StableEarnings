CALL ME BROOKE tracked the frontrunner outside into the turn, assumed command at the five sixteenths pole, was roused in mid stretch finding another
gear, opened up mildly in deep stretch and held off the closers at the finish line. TENPENNY NAIL rated behind the pacesetter entering the turn, was
shuffled back inside losing position nearing the three furlong marker, slipped up the fence nicely midpoint through the turn, challenged on the rail in mid
stretch and was trying to gain late but could not close enough in time to get the victory. DELIGHTFUL DREAMER was void of early speed and could see
them all in the early stages of the race, angled out widest in the six path to begin her rally turning for home and closed well outside to get the middle share of
a three horse photo for the place award. CRYSTAL CRESCENT settled near the rear at the half, was under a hard hold behind the tracking flight at the
seven sixteenths marker, put in a run between rivals two furlongs from the prize, shifted to the five path at the furlong marker and ran on late just missing out
for higher placings at the finish. ABSOLUTE JEWEL broke outwards at the start, settled near the rear in the early stages, commenced her run four wide
around foes at the quarter pole, loomed outside at the furlong marker and stalled in deep stretch. SWEET EDITION tracked between rivals at the half,
watched the engaging leaders into the turn, appeared to have clipped heels stumbling at the five sixteenths marker, recovered to angle inside for the stretch
drive and could not be a factor running to the wire. SHISHKA took control leaving the chute, set the fractions down the backside, was collared by the winner
outside midway on the turn, fought on until mid stretch and folded in the final sixteenth. STEWARDS GENERAL INQUIRY IN THE VICINITY OF THE
THREE EIGHTHS POLE RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

Footnotes
BIG WARDEN moved forward inside to set the pace, drifted out turning into upper stretch, held sway under steady handling. CONFIDENT N ELITE stalked
the winner from outside, moved in a bit past the nine-sixteenths, pursued two to three wide on the turn, came into upper stretch six wide, loomed a threat in
mid-stretch but could make no headway. EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN broke outwardly, shifted in and settled early, advanced three to four wide and between
runners on the turn, kept on in the stretch for show honors. MIDNIGHT RAMBLIN broke outwardly, advanced four then six wide on the turn, came into upper
stretch eight deep and within striking distance but evened out. DROP A CARIBOU was bumped into a rival and steadied slightly nearing the half while
between runners, raced two wide on the turn, came out five to six deep for the stretch and ran on. MY GIRL HOOTER was outpaced, saved ground racing
inside till the stretch and failed to menace. CHAIRMAN FOX was bumped lightly and in tight nearing the half, moved nearer the rail heading to the turn,
failed to rally.

Footnotes
BLUEBIRDS OVER took command inside entering the first turn, relinquished the lead with three quarters of a mile to go, tracked the loose leader down the
backstretch, took closer order to the pacesetter with three eighths remaining, was urged for more two furlongs from home to rally up for the lead at the
furlong marker outside and was edging away for the victory at the finish line. ONE BAY HEMINGWAY rated behind the pace into the first turn, was eager
under a hold, assumed command entering the backstretch, opened up on the field at the half, continued to set the fractions up front on the far turn, was
headed by the winner outside at the eighth pole, battled on stubbornly through the lane but gave way to the winner in deep stretch. MO TOURIST settled on
the rail behind the leaders into the first turn, trailed the field saving ground down the backside while unhurried, was nudged on inside with three furlongs to
the wire and showed some good late energy to close in and capture third right at the finish line. FOREVER DIXIE stalked three wide while well in hand
racing down the backside, began to close in on the leaders midpoint on the far turn, loomed four wide in upper stretch, could not gain on the top contesting
pair at the furlong pole and stalled very late losing the show award at the wire. HAL stalked three wide into the first turn, travelled between rivals near the
rear in this compact field down the backstretch, was ridden for more midpoint on the turn with horses on either side, offered little response and weakened at
the furlong marker.

Footnotes
COLTONS DREAM moved clear and shifted in to set the pace racing off the inside in the two to three path, held sway under moderate urging. SEA SCOUT
moved up inside, could not reach the winner but was clearly second best. RACE FOR PINKS raced between foes two to three wide into the turn, shifted in
about the five-sixteenths, angled out in upper stretch, kept on late to get show honors over EXECUTIVE SEARCH, who was in close pursuit early racing
three to four wide, steadily dropped back from midway on the turn losing several positions, moved inside a foe in upper stretch, kept on late to regain
position just missing third. MASTER SPY appeared to bump with a rival at the start, raced near the inside, was ridden along midway on the turn, shifted out
gradually coming into upper stretch eight wide, ran on. WESTERN TROUBLE advanced outside four to five wide on the turn but could not sustain the effort.
EXPLODE went five to six wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. BROWNING ISLAND saved ground to no avail. WENJACK bumped and steadied
at the start, raced toward the back two to three wide, failed to threaten. TYCOON dropped back from mid-pack three to four wide and between, was in tight
about the seven-sixteenths, did not threaten.

Footnotes
PRIDE AND PASSION bumped with his inside rival at the break, chased four wide outside at the half, rallied three wide at the quarter marker, took control
under left handed urging between foes just inside the eighth pole and held well late for the win. EXECUTIVE SIGHT settled in mid pack behind runners into
the turn, had to wait while racing between horses five sixteenths from the line, shifted to the four path in the stretch drive and found a seam five wide for
clear running room in deep stretch to close in for the place share. TALL WATER was away slowly at the break, travelled inside near the back at the half mile
marker, advanced smartly on the rail with three furlongs remaining, shifted out four wide to loom boldly in upper stretch but needed more late. BIG TIME
LOUIE took command at the start, continued to dictate the pace on the turn, was collared outside in mid stretch and tired the final sixteenth losing positions
late. CRAFTY CONQUEST had a good tracking position inside racing through the turn, took closer order on the rail with five sixteenths remaining, shifted
out to the two path to be in the mix at the top of the stretch and gave way between challengers at the furlong marker. QIAN B C bumped his outside rival at
the start, settled four wide in mid pack at the half, was urged three wide entering the turn, angled out in the five path to contend at the top of the lane and
stalled in mid stretch. PUGIN was void of early speed to trail the field in the beginning, saved ground while chasing the pack through the turn, angled just off
the fence at the furlong pole and passed a tiring runner down the lane. ERRATIQUE chased between foes down the backside, weakened with runners on
either side three eighths from home, gave way at the top of the stretch and was not a presence running to the finish.

Footnotes
LIVIN ON LUV settled into stride of the pace, went two wide on the turn, shifted inside a rival at the top of the stretch, rallied inside that one then came out in
mid-stretch and drove past the leader just past the sixteenth pole and cleared. APRIL DE VELP broke awkwardly, raced at the rear, fanned out seven wide
turning for home, moved out another two paths forcing a rival out in upper stretch, rallied to get up for place over DAWN PHAROAH, who was mildly coaxed
forward inside to set the pace racing in or just off the rail, was clear in upper stretch but outfinished and lost place late. MASON'S MUSIC settled off the
pace outside, moved out from four wide early on the turn to seven wide by the top of the stretch, kept on mildly. BOSSKAYE was bumped at the start, saved
ground on the turn racing about mid-division, advanced inside foes and came out three wide at the top of the stretch with aim on the leader but evened out.
ROYAL CHROME fanned eight wide outside runners into upper stretch, was forced out further by a rival soon after, lacked the needed late kick.
SHEBATOWN bumped a rival at the start, chased two to three wide, asked to keep up past the three-eighths but had no response and weakened. LADY IN
RED had the early lead then continued to stalk three to four wide, weakened. FRAC TALES was forwardly-positioned outside, went four to six wide on the
turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
SILENT CAUSEWAY had a good position tracking the leaders on the rail down the backstretch, continued to have a perfect trip waiting inside on the turn,
angled three wide off the dueling leaders at the quarter pole, pounced to the lead in upper stretch outside and drew away comfortably for the win. KITTEN'S
ROMANCE travelled in the middle of the pack two wide at the half mile marker, was coaxed inside midway through the turn, shifted four wide off the tiring
pacesetters in mid stretch and finished strongly on the wrong lead to best the rest at the wire. STARLIGHT RIDGE broke out at the start, settled in mid pack
three wide at the half, was nudged along three wide entering the turn, angled out to find clear running room six wide in the drive to the wire and closed with
good intent to get up for a clear third. BIG BAND LUZZIANN broke well to lead leaving the chute, continued up front on the backstretch and turn, was
headed outside at the top of the lane by rivals, weakened in mid stretch on the rail and had to settle for holding on to a minor share. DANGER kept the
frontrunner honest down the backside, pressed the issue running on the turn, contested for the lead with foes on either side turning for home and tired in
deep stretch to just miss for a small award. HAI BOBBI tracked just outside watching the engaging co leaders with three eighths from the finish, was roused
midpoint on the turn, offered little run and retreated at the top of the lane. MONASTERY LANE trailed the field in the early stages, took closer order to the
pack into the turn racing on the fence, was ridden inside to keep up with rivals two furlongs from the prize and was not a threat in the stretch drive.
BUTTERED TOAST settled in midfield five deep at the half, offered a brief run outside runners three furlongs from home, angled out widest in the seven
path turning for home and stopped in mid stretch.

Footnotes
VANBRUGH moved forward to set the pace near inside, widened on the far turn, drew away further when put to urging in upper stretch, held safe.
EMBRACE MY UNCLE settled off the pace outside three wide early, moved out five wide late on the far turn, drifted in a little in mid-stretch, was no match
for the winner but secured the place. DESOLATOR broke a bit awkwardly, was taken back in the early going, saved ground inside, came out on the far turn
fanning six wide into upper stretch, was along for show. PRIDEOFDISTINCTION raced mid-pack inside on or just off the rail, came out a bit in upper stretch
and ran on. MNEMBA ISLAND was two to three wide early, moved out five wide on the far turn, failed to rally. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) rated in behind inside,
came out and raced two to three wide on the far turn, weakened in the stretch. HIT THE POINT broke a half-step slowly, lacked early speed, swung seven
wide for the drive, was never near enough to threaten. SHANGASSAH chased the winner from outside two to three wide, dropped back and tired.

Footnotes
WAR BOMBER (IRE) kept the leader in his sights in the early stages, was asked to reel in the lone speed at the quarter pole, quickly pounced to take
control at the top of the stretch and drew away convincingly at the furlong marker. PRICELESS WILL settled just off the fence midfield running into the turn,
moved outside of runners rallying three furlongs to the wire, contended three wide at the top of the lane, could not threaten the odds on winner with an
eighth to go but held well to capture the place share in a close photo. TOLD IT ALL tracked the frontrunner on the rail into the turn, was urged on the fence
with five sixteenths left to run, could not keep pace with the contenders initially in upper stretch and resurged between foes at the eighth pole to just miss out
on second place at the finish line. SIR SEAMUS broke well to set the fractions down the backstretch, continued up front racing through the turn, was
collared by the winner outside in upper stretch, fought on until the sixteenth pole and tired late settling on the fringes. RON'S GIZMO travelled in the middle
of the pack on the rail with a half remaining, was ridden for more midpoint on the turn, shifted four wide entering the stretch and made little impact running to
the wire. LUCKMAN threw his head at the start and trailed down the backside, continued watch the pack ahead of him on the turn, angled outside three
wide for the drive and could only find enough to pass a tired runner down the lane. EPILOGUE settled near the back in the early stages, was asked
throughout the turn, showed no interest and could not get involved in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
RENEGADE REBEL broke sharply and set the pace in the clear racing just off the rail, was unasked till upper stretch, just held from RYDER RYDER
RYDER, who broke in the air, settled at the rear racing off the inside, began to pick it up three then four wide on the far turn, finished strongly but was
gaining too late and just missed. HONOR D LADY stalked from outside runners in the second flight early, continued to pursue three wide, gained steadily
and slowly in the stretch but needed more. STATE OF MIND raced between foes into the first turn just off the leader, swung five wide turning for home,
needed more. COLLECT DATTT was held up in behind inside the second flight early, dropped back, came off the rail for the stretch run and was no late
threat.

Footnotes
TWO YEAR CONTRACT pressed the early speed at the half inside, took over the top spot racing on the rail three eighths from the wire, opened up on the
field at the quarter pole and was kept to the task down the lane to hold off any closers at the wire. PAPA KATZ trailed in the early stages, circled five wide
making a strong move with three furlongs remaining to run, loomed four wide turning for home but could not gain in deep stretch to threaten the winner.
DOMINANT DESTROYER tracked behind the contesting leaders at the half, shifted inwards to the rail at the seven sixteenths marker, was in tight quarters
entering the turn, advanced up the fence with clear running room midpoint on the turn, posed a threat between foes at the top of the stretch but needed
more to challenge the top pair running to the line. MAHOGONY WILDCAT was unhurried to be at the back of the pack in the early going, trailed the field on
the turn, rallied four wide at the quarter pole and showed some late interest to finish up for a minor role. WIN THE DRAW settled on the rail near the rear in
the beginning, waited behind a wall of runners at the three furlong marker, roused three wide two furlongs from the wire with clear run and passed tired foes
in the stretch. DYNA'S BOURBON stalked four deep mid pack down the backstretch, rallied four wide with three eighths to the finish, chased the winner on
the turn, contended for a share of the prize at the top of the lane and tired in the final furlong. VELOCITO tracked four wide at the half mile marker, offered a
brief run to keep position between rivals at the three furlong pole, weakened at the quarter marker and faltered at the top of the stretch. THE BAND
COMING broke sharp to be the early speed down the backstretch, was collared inside by the winner at the half, gave way between horses in midturn and
folded in upper stretch.
