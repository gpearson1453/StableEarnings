Footnotes
PASSION TO PLEASE brushed her outside rival at the start, was situated near the back with a half remaining, advanced nicely on the rail throughout the
turn, closed strongly up the fence to lead at the sixteenth pole and was inching away at the finish line. CELTIC REVIVAL sat behind the early speedsters on
the rail into the turn, closed in on the early pacesetter inside two furlongs from the line, shifted just off the tiring leader in upper stretch, took command briefly
three wide at the eighth pole and could not hold off the fast closing winner in the final sixteenth. SPIRIT BELLE pressed the early frontrunner three furlongs
to the wire, could not match strides with the leader midpoint on the turn, shifted out four wide at the top of the stretch and finished with intent to hold safe for
show at the line. CHERRY GARDENS was situated midfield just outside in the early stages, was urged to go on at the quarter pole, gave little response and
finished up evenly the final eighth. SAKE AND SUSHI showed good speed to dictate the pace down the backside, opened up on the field running through
the turn, began to shorten stride nearing the furlong marker and gave way the final sixteenth. D'ORO BABY was brushed at the break, travelled inside near
the rear entering the turn, roused on the fence five sixteenths from home, put in a mild run until the top of the lane and levelled off inside in mid stretch.
SIXTOFIVE settled in mid pack outside in the beginning, could not keep pace with rivals on the turn and made little impression racing to the wire. POLA
STAR was void of early speed to trail the field down the backstretch, could not regroup running on the turn and was not a factor racing to the finish.

Footnotes
SHES THE NORTH bobbled ever so slightly at the start, settled off the pace inside, saved ground early on the turn, began to move out midway on the bend,
came into upper stretch six deep, took aim and despite drifting in a bit struck the lead outside the sixteenth pole and cleared under steady handling.
MONASTERY LANE raced last but one early, saved ground on or just off the rail on the turn, moved out five wide turning into the stretch, shifted in seeking
room then had to alter back out, ran on to secure the place. SASSY MARTINI pursued the pace from outside going three to four wide on the turn, came into
upper stretch five deep, drifted in a bit past the quarter pole, kept on late to get up for show honors over SPARKLE SAMMY, who moved clear and shifted in
early to set the pace racing just off the rail, was asked for more in upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. IMA DAREDEVIL tracked the pace from inside,
ran on evenly. NORTHERN RUBY settled outside off the pace going four to five wide on the turn, failed to menace. CARELESS HEIRESS brushed the gate
lightly but gained forward position pursuing the pace two to three wide and between runners, drifted out a bit in upper stretch and weakened. CLASSY
MISTRESS was outpaced racing off the inside. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD was in tight after the break as a rival moved inwards in front, chased briefly three to
four wide, tired.

SWINGING MANDY took control from the start, was loose up front down the backstretch, continued to be unchallenged racing on the turn, turned for home
with a clear lead and was kept to the task in mid stretch to win comfortably at the wire. TRIZZEL TRAZZEL settled on the rail behind the winner racing down
the backside in this small field, shifted outside two wide to begin her rally with three furlongs left to go, angled out to the four path for the drive and finished
up a non threatening second besting the others in the end. FIRST ROUND PICK trailed the compact field just outside with a half mile remaining, was roused
for more three eighths to the wire, showed some late energy on the fence in mid stretch and closed in to get up for third money. SACRED DANCER chased
the winner in the early stages, was ridden to try to close the gap on the free wheeling leader five sixteenths from the finish, could not make an impact at the
top of the stretch and weakened at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
SOCIAL JUSTICE settled off the pace racing two wide early, was in a tad tight at the three-quarters, began to advance in behind a rivals two to three wide
on the far turn, came four wide into upper stretch, bid along with FREE SHIPPING, dueled with that one from the furlong marker, got the nod. FREE
SHIPPING settled inside, took closer order on the far turn, came out two wide for room turning for home, bid with and inside the aforementioned, dueled but
was outfinished while clearly second best. STREET MAX moved clear and shifted in to the three path on the first turn dictating terms, continued with the
lead in the two path on the far turn, was overtaken in upper stretch, had no extra but held show honors. ALL TIME CLASSIC was a bit rank into the first turn
racing inside on or off the rail, settled in behind to track from just off the rail, moved out and made a mild brief bid three wide leaving the far turn, lacked the
needed late kick. BEAUFORT raced between foes three to four wide on the first turn, settled toward the back, swung eight to nine deep turning for home
and kicked on mildly with some late interest. RED MAVRIK was caught six wide into the first turn, moved forward heading to the far turn racing five then six
deep on that bend, came in a bit in upper stretch, failed to rally. THE BAND COMING was up close five then four wide early, put to urging late on the far turn
having gone four to five wide on that bend, had no response and weakened. NGABE raced off the pace two to three wide early, swung six wide turning for
home, steadied when in tight in upper stretch. POT COMMITTED was caught five wide on the first turn, asked for run at the half-mile marker but had no
response.

Footnotes
MISS VYVYANNE took command from the start, continued to dictate the pace through the turn inside, was briefly challenged outside two furlongs from the
finish, was roused in mid stretch to draw away for the win. COLLECTIVELY had a good tracking position early behind the winner on the fence, shifted out to
rally three wide at the quarter pole, offered a mild bid outside with an eighth to go and could not gain in the late stages. MO TOUGH tracked the leading trio
entering the turn, was ridden to go on with two furlongs remaining, angled out five wide in upper stretch and closed in determinedly to capture third nearing
the finish line. EME CLAIRE was situated in the middle of the pack on the rail at the half, waited patiently inside running on the turn, rallied inside at the top
of the stretch and finished well just missing out on holding for the show award. STAR CANDY kept close range to the winner just outside down the
backstretch, offered a mild bid for the lead at the quarter marker and weakened between rivals at the eighth pole losing a few positions late. GHOST D'ORO
hit the gate on the start, stalked near the back in the early stages, put in a good run between rivals three eighths to the wire and stalled behind runners on
the drive to the line. BEYOND REASON was coaxed early down the backside to keep pace with the field, made little impression running around the turn and
could not make a presence racing to the finish. WORRY LESS stalked in mid pack between foes in the beginning, was ridden three wide five sixteenths
from home, angled out to be six wide for the drive with a chance for a small share and gave way at the furlong marker. LIPLOCK shied away from her inside
rival to begin, was slow into stride afterwards to trail down the backside, could not recover through the race to be involved at the finish. TWO REDHEADS
was squeezed at the break, settled near the rear inside down the backside, advanced a little on the rail three furlongs to the line, saved ground throughout
the turn and faded on the fence in the stretch. NEOLITHIC NATION broke outwards at the start, stalked in midfield four deep at the half mile marker, lost
touch with the pack while getting out on the turn and could not get involved running to the finish.

WHIMSICAL DANCE settled off the pace, went mostly two to three then four wide on the turn, came out nine wide in upper stretch forcing GABBY
SQUARED out further, rallied in tandem with that one dueling from about the eighth pole to the wire and prevailed under steady handling. GABBY
SQUARED settled outside toward the rear, began to advance while moving out from three to five wide on the turn, came into upper stretch wider still then
was brushed and forced out ten deep by the aforementioned, dueled with that one but was second best. ARRIVISTE was unhurried early racing just off the
inside, moved nearer the rail past the three-sixteenths and rallied through the stretch to secure show honors. ERASMO'S GIRL steadied near the
nine-sixteenths when in tight, moved out from two to three wide on the turn, came out further in upper stretch but was in tight behind and between past the
three-sixteenths, kept on well late once in the clear to improve position. FOXY DIVA tracked from inside, bid inside the leader at the top of the stretch while
drifting out a bit, had no extra for late stretch. CLASSIC COLORS stalked from outside, advanced four wide on the turn, made a brief bid in upper stretch but
lacked the needed late kick. TRISH THE DISH stalked in behind the pace three wide through the turn, came into upper stretch a bit wider, ran on evenly. I
HAVE AN IDEA set the pace racing off the rail, weakened through the stretch. BAYOU BELLE was close up in behind inside, steadied on heels near the
nine-sixteenths, failed to rally. LADY MAEVE (IRE) advanced outside five wide on the turn, bid briefly eight wide in upper stretch, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
COLLECTING FLATTER broke sharp to lead early on, was hounded by an outside pace rival throughout the turn, disposed of that threat in upper stretch to
open up at the furlong marker and held off the closing challenger in deep stretch under right handed urging to the wire. FOREVER DIXIE rallied five wide
around foes into the turn, continued to pick off runners two furlongs to the wire, had dead aim on the winner in mid stretch and was gaining but could not get
there in time to garner the win. ANAM CARA advanced nicely up the fence running on the turn, was in range for a share at the top of the stretch inside and
determinedly battled on the rail and put in a good showing to get up for the show. HELLUVA HOLIDAY settled in the middle of the pack three wide into the
turn, steadied momentarily between runners three furlongs to the finish, was shuffled back losing momentum briefly five sixteenths from the finish, angled
five wide for the stretch run and closed well outside to get up to be a fringe player at the wire. FEARLESS ANGEL was situated on the rail behind the
dueling leaders down the backstretch, edged closer inside to the winner midway on the turn, shifted out in the three path to contend in upper stretch and
stalled at the furlong marker. COLLECT DATTT was in tight at the three eighths pole, lost a bit of ground to the field on the turn afterwards, rallied four wide
in the stretch and offered a good closing finish in the end. MICHELE M. tracked the dueling leaders three wide entering the turn, was ridden for more in the
three path midturn, shifted out to be five wide between rivals for the run to the wire and could only offer an even finish to the line. DOLCE SOPRESA stalked
midfield in the two path at the half, was asked for more run midpoint on the turn between horses, showed some late interest inside at the furlong pole and
was in the mix in a multiple horse photo for the minor placings. PLAY THE MUSIC pressed the winner at the half, engaged two wide for the top spot
throughout the turn, gave way with runners on either side at the eighth pole and retreated the final sixteenth. ATTABE stalked near the rear at the half mile
marker, lost interest running on the turn to trail turning for home and had little to show running to the finish line. REPLENISH was unhurried after the start to
trail down the backside, took closer order to the pack around the turn and had nothing to give inside for the stretch drive.

Footnotes
HAL tracked in behind, moved out a bit coming to the quarter pole, bid outside the leader at the three-sixteenths, took a narrow lead, dueled and held that
rival. TICKER TAPE HOME set the pace inside, was headed in upper stretch, dueled but was only second best. FIRING BULLETS settled inside, came out
about the five-sixteenths, was three wide in the stretch but no match for the top pair. CHISELER raced off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn,
was never near enough to threaten. KEEN FLATTER pursued from outside four to five wide, dropped back and made no late bid. HANK OLLIE pressed
three wide, dropped back and tired.

Footnotes
REINS OF PURPLE stalked near the rear inside down the backside, rallied on the rail five sixteenths from the finish, split foes in the five path at the top of
the lane and found her best stride late closing in to get up at the shadow of the wire. STOLE THE RING advanced nicely up the rail running on the turn,
shifted just outside turning for home, closed well between rivals to lead briefly in deep stretch and was caught in the final strides at the finish. ROYAL
CHROME lead the field in the early stages, put away her chasing rival in upper stretch, cleared up front at the eighth pole and tired the final sixteenth
holding for third. T'PRING tracked three wide with a half left to run, was ridden to go after the frontrunners midway on the turn, offered little response and
finished up five wide to race evenly in the final eighth for a minor share. SUSPICIOUS MINDS raced last entering the turn, travelled between and behind
rivals looking for a seam three sixteenths to the wire and showed some energy to pass tiring runners in the last furlong. BEST BANK SHOT was situated
close to the back of the pack on the rail entering the turn, saved ground while waiting to pounce through the turn, had clear run on the fence at the top of the
stretch and had no finish to give late. SKIPOVER settled in the middle of the pack three wide on the outside at the half, travelled three wide through the turn
making little impact and could not get interested racing in the seven path running to the wire. SHE'S SO COLD trailed the field down the backstretch, made
an early move four wide three furlongs from the line, urged to go on outside at the quarter pole, angled to the eight path for the stretch run and was empty in
the late stages of the race. FIRE EMOJI chased the early pacesetter in the beginning, was ridden to keep up with the leader midway on the turn, offered
little effort when roused and stopped between foes in the final eighth.

TRADING BAY settled off the pace outside, went five then six wide on the turn, came into upper stretch nine deep, rallied to gain the place. INTO TOURING
raced off the pace, moved out from five to seven wide on the turn, came into upper stretch ten wide, gained show honors. OL' BLONDIE tracked in behind
just off the fence, bid inside past the quarter pole, struck the lead while coming out a bit at the top of the stretch, was outkicked late. JILL attended the pace
from outside going four to six wide on the turn, came out seven wide in upper stretch, bid soon after but ran on evenly late. SHOSHANAH set the pace
racing off the rail, drifted out leaving the turn, weakened. BILLYJANE advanced inside turning for home, evened out in the lane. IMA BEAST chased from
three to four wide and between runners, failed to rally. AMERICAN HEROINE was well off the early leaders racing off the inside, came out further for the
stretch run, ran on mildly. VERDEJO chased three to four wide on the turn, faded. ARRA GO WAN was prominent early three to four wide, came up empty.
