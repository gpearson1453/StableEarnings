Footnotes
STARS ON FIRE (IRE) broke sharply, was urged inside a rival disputing the pace into the turn, dispatched that foe to shake clear in upper stretch and was
kept to firm left handed pressure. GOLDEN STAR angled to the inside stalking just behind the pacesetter on the backstretch, steadied momentarily off that
foe nearing the three furlong marker, tipped out midstretch and continued willingly to prove best of the others. MISS RIVER RAT was a bit slow into stride,
saved ground in last racing into the bend, came around a tiring foe gathering momentum in upper stretch, then angled to the rail in late stages to narrowly
edge rivals for a share on the wire. DIVINE GRACE, off a step behind the leaders, angled inwards while being urged to advance between foes nearing the
turn, shifted out three deep racing into upper stretch, raced in close quarters while exchanging some contact with ANGEL EXPRESS, then altered course to
the inside leaving the furlong marker while being just outkicked for a share. ANGEL EXPRESS was urged to forward a placing three deep pursuing the
leaders into the turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch, exchanged some contact with DIVINE GRACE in the lane, then lugged inwards under
pressure through late stages. KEEP LEFT angled inwards while being urged to terms with the eventual winner on the backstretch, forced the pace outside
that foe through the turn and gave way nearing midstretch. BLAZE BEAUTY, off slowly, tracked off the second flight between foes racing into the turn,
shifted four wide in upper stretch and continued evenly late. J Z'S FINE WINE tracked off the second flight along the inside early, saved ground to upper
stretch and faded in the drive. PRINCESS TONI, pulling hard against rating three deep between foes in the last flight racing to the turn, never gained
contention. MIZZEN GEE MA, reserved four wide in the last flight on the backstretch, never seriously menaced. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF
GOLDEN STAR LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL ALLEGING INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE TURN BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
WATCHIN THE WHEELS was urged to a contending position stalking just outside the first flight three deep racing to the backstretch, continued with a
steady advance in that path on the far turn to challenge for command racing into upper stretch, then kicked clear through the lane under firm
encouragement. KIMBERLY FRANCES, off last, was settled between foes racing to the backstretch, swung out to the five path racing into upper stretch and
continued with interest to prove best of the others. QUEEN'S MISSION broke readily to gain the advantage nearest the rail racing to the first turn, lost the
lead and her path midway through the first bend, switched outside a rival entering the backstretch to press the issue to the second bend, gained the
advantage racing into the far turn, but proved no match for the top pair in the drive. WEEKEND PASS settled inside rivals in the last flight racing to the
backstretch and passed only tiring rivals late. DARING DAMSEL shifted out widest racing into the first turn to race in the four path to the backstretch and
never gained contention. LOUIE P, urged to a forward placing while losing the advantage in the opening stages, came around a rival disputing the pace into
the first turn, angled to the rail once gaining the advantage nearing the backstretch, dueled inside a rival through the backstretch to the second bend and
gave out early.

Footnotes
PINEDALE was settled last to the backstretch, gathered momentum along the inside racing into the far turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and
continued to make steady progress in a prolonged drive to wrest a narrow advantage at the wire under strong handling. MILLARD'S SMILE tracked off the
leaders in the three path, then four wide into the far turn, was prompted to make a steady, three wide gain to challenge for command into upper stretch,
dueled for command between rivals through the stretch in a protracted skirmish but just failed to contain the winner while prevailing for the place honors.
AHEADOFTHEGAME sped to the lead along the inside, set the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled for command into the stretch and resisted
the top pair grudgingly to the end. AMANI'S EAGLE angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn,
awaiting an opening nearing upper stretch but had no closing bid. CO CONSPIRATOR, forwardly placed attending the pace between foes in the opening
five furlongs, gave way into upper stretch. CINDY'S STORM was urged to a forward placing three wide racing to the backstretch and gave way early.

Footnotes
SAMYAZA stalked just off the leaders along the inside to the backstretch, tipped out to the three path in upper stretch and continued with a sustained
response in a protracted skirmish to narrowly prevail at the wire under firm encouragement. POWER THROUGH, urged to the lead along the inside racing
to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, shifted off the inside resisting the winner's bid to late stages but proved only second
best. LORING PARK ran loose momentarily when being walked over to the paddock before the start, tracked off the second flight three wide to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide on the far turn, continued five wide into upper stretch and finished willingly to close the gap while earning a
share. ULTIMATE IRONY, bumped, then shut off at the start, was reserved along the inside to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into the lane and
made some belated progress. DYNABLUE tracked the leaders between foes behind the second flight to the far turn, was prompted to advance while being
fanned four wide between foes into the stretch and lacked the needed final kick. GATE CREW tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground
on the far turn to advance inside the leaders lodging a brief bid but flattened out leaving midstretch. CHICKEN TRUCK tracked the leaders outside a rival in
second flight racing to the far turn, then faded between foes into the stretch. BENS MALICE was reserved between foes to the backstretch, steadied out of
close quarters nearing the three furlong marker, shifted to the inside but lacked a late response. MYSTIFIER ducked in at the start bumping ULTIMATE
IRONY, was settled into stride while switching off the inside racing to the backstretch and lacked a rally. IRONMAN RICHIE was urged prompting the pace
outside a rival to the backstretch and gave way racing into the far turn. CHANGI settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and dropped out early.

Footnotes
COME ON SWEET PEA was settled well off the field racing to the turn, angled out six wide in upper stretch gathering momentum and produced her best
stride in the closing stages to prevail under mild encouragement. GHAALEB'S MAGIC was urged inside foes disputing the pace in the opening stages,
eased off the leaders racing into the bend while shifting outside those foes, advanced to challenge four wide between foes into upper stretch gaining a
narrow advantage but was collared nearing the wire. TIME BREAK tracked off the first flight shifting off the inside racing to the turn, advanced on the leaders
four wide on the turn, then five wide into upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. SUMMER LOVIN settled between foes in early stages, angled
inside on the turn to lodge a brief bid inside foes in upper stretch but soon flattened out. IRISH HALO settled into stride racing well off the inside to the turn,
angled inside foes racing through the stretch but never menaced. FLYING BUSINESS, urged between foes disputing the pace on the backstretch, dueled
for command inside foes on the turn a bit off the rail and gave out leaving midstretch. ARCH FLYER joined the pace three deep in early stages, pressed the
issue in that path into upper stretch and gave out in late stages. SIMPLY FAST, off last, trailed throughout.

MOM'S TOWN tracked the leader between horses down the back straight tracked in the two path on the turn, came into the lane three wide in range,
engaged outside the leading pair in upper stretch, drifted out several paths in upper stretch but nonetheless drove to the lead past the furlong mark and
prevailed. JOYZELLA settled toward the rear, inside continued inside toward the rear around the turn until beginning to angle out past the three eighths,
swung eight wide into the lane, and finished well outside. CAT ROYALE broke inward and bumped CANDY LOOKER in the opening strides, tracked the
pace three wide early, engaged outside of GO ON GIRL into the turn, pressed, drew even near the five sixteenths, vied two wide into upper stretch,
continued to vie inside of MOM'S TOWN to midstretch, was no match past the furlong mark and lost the place late. CANTOO chased behind the leading
group outside of GULF BENDER early, chased in the four path on the turn, swung six wide into the lane, chased on willingly but was ultimately outkicked for
the place. LOVEYOULIKECRAZY tracked the leader inside early, tracked the leading pair in the three path on the turn, began to angle out near the three
eighths, was driven in upper stretch and ultimately lacked the needed kick. LIL CARRIE D leapt awkwardly out of the gate, settled in the rear pair, continued
toward the rear in the four to five path on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and chased on mildly. GO ON GIRL sent to the lead between horses, was
engaged by CAT ROYALE into the turn, vied inside that foe into upper stretch, but proved no match approaching the furlong mark and weakened. PRIMITY
settled two wide toward the rear, was pushed along two wide on the turn, swung out seven wide into the lane and came up empty. CANDY LOOKER took
back at the start after being bumped from both sides, raced toward the rear down the backstretch and in the three to four path on the turn, swung out nine
wide into the lane and lacked a rally. GULF BENDER broke inward and bumped GO ON GIRL in the opening strides, chased inside of CANTOO behind the
leading group early, flattened inside around the turn, and continued to weaken down the lane.

Footnotes
HIGH BROW raced at the inside of the tracking flight into the first turn, chased inside down the back straight, tracked the leading pair inside into the far turn,
continued in range in the two to three path around the bend, dropped inside of SUPRISE CAT in upper stretch, rallied, took over midstretch and stayed on
well to the finish. SCAT SHACK raced three wide into the clubhouse turn, advanced to stalk the leader alone into the backstretch, engaged outside that foe
near the seven sixteenths while racing in the three path, came three wide into the lane, kept on in range of HIGH BROW to midstretch after that foe took the
lead inside of SUPRISE CAT in upper stretch, was ultimately outfinished but ran on a clear second best. FLASHY RICHIE settled inside at the rear, hugged
the rail around the far turn, offered a mild inside bid into the lane and chased on best of the rest. SUPRISE CAT was soon clear on the lead, was engaged
by SCAT SHACK near the seven sixteenths while racing in the two path, carried a narrow lead while driven between horses in upper stretch, was headed by
HIGH BROW near the three sixteenths, and weakened. ZARMAE settled near the rear, chased three wide down the backstretch, settled back to the rear
pair approaching the five eighths, raced in the three path in the rear pair on the far turn, was all out late but ultimately lacked the needed rally. BOURBON
DELIGHT was rank between horses into the first turn, chased in range between horses while still keen down the backstretch, was pushed along in the four
path on the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
DEORA STORE broke inward and bumped STUN GUN in the opening strides, chased four and then three deep down the backstretch, continued three wide
on the turn, began to take closer order approaching the quarter, swung five wide into the lane, sustained the rally, drifted in slightly late, struck the front past
the sixteenth pole, and won going away. BOURBON TEDDY was sent hard, set a pressured pace inside of GREAT PLAINES, kicked clear into the lane,
remained clear past midstretch, was caught inside the sixteenth marker but kept on well enough to hold place. EVIDENCE raced between horses in the
leading flight early, settled back and chased the leading pair in the three to four path on the turn, came four wide into upper stretch, continued to chase the
leader but finished only evenly. FUTURE VISION was bumped soundly by TSALI in the opening strides, tracked the leading trio inside, was driven into the
lane, gradually angled out through upper stretch, finished willingly and missed the show. TAPIT SAM broke a bit awkwardly and raced rank early, was
wrangled to the rear, raced in the three to four path on the turn, swung eight wide into the lane, and showed good belated interest outside. TSALI broke in
and bumped FUTURE VISION soundly in the opening strides, chased between horses early, settled back near the five eighths, raced toward the rear in the
two to three path on the turn and lacked the needed rally. STUN GUN was pinballed between BLEEDING BLUE and DEORA STORE in the opening strides,
trailed, saved ground on the turn, swung six wide into the lane and passed tiring horses. BLEEDING BLUE bumped STUN GUN in the opening strides,
chased between horses, floated seven wide into the lane and came up empty. GREAT PLAINES was sent to hound the pace outside of BOURBON TEDDY,
pressed two wide, was no match into the lane and emptied out.

causing a chain reaction, tracked the leading pair inside of THE LAST OPTION, edged closer inside of BEHAVIN MYSELF down the backstretch, tracked
inside of BEHAVIN MYSELF and BULLDOG OF BERGEN around the far turn, took the lead inside of BEHAVIN MYSELF into the lane, cleared past the
furlong mark and kept on safe to the finish. BUXTERHOOTER chased toward the rear two wide through the clubhouse turn, began to improve inside near
the nine sixteenths, sustained that inside rally into the lane, stayed on with interest to the finish and secured the place late inside of BEHAVIN MYSELF.
BEHAVIN MYSELF came out on BULLDOG OF BERGEN into the clubhouse turn causing a chain reaction of bumping in the line of horses to his outside,
set the pace while prompted by BULLDOG OF BERGEN, was joined on the backstretch by BIG PINES SANDY to his inside and continued on a narrow lead
between horses, kept on the lead around the far turn while still attended by BULLDOG OF BERGEN, was reengaged and headed by BIG PINES SANDY
into the lane, proved no match from midstretch and lost the place late. IRISH MAJOR raced at the inside of the trailing pair, regained touch along the inside
on the far turn, was driven in upper stretch while still inside, and ran on best of the rest. GAGOOTS settled back between horses in the opening strides,
raced near the rear inside around the clubhouse turn, continued near the rear down the back straight, was pushed along two wide on the far turn, and drove
past tiring horses in the lane. NOT VERY GENTLE was bumped hard and checked between KRAMDEN and FEELING DANGEROUS into the first turn as a
result of the chain reaction, settled near the rear in the five to six path on the first turn, took gradually closer order down the back straight, chased in range
behind the leading trio inside of THE LAST OPTION around the far turn, but lacked the needed kick into the lane and flattened out. BULLDOG OF BERGEN
was forced out approaching the first turn when FUTURE VISION came out, prompted the pace outside of that foe, attended three wide down the back
straight, vied three wide around the far turn, proved no match for the leaders into the lane when driven and weakened. KRAMDEN checked hard into the
first turn between BIG PINES SANDY and NOT VERY GENTLE as a result of FUTURE VISION coming out, settled toward the rear of the main pack, was
pushed along on the far turn and lacked a rally. THE LAST OPTION was bumped by FEELING DANGEROUS approaching the first turn as part of the chain
reaction, advanced to join outside of BIG PINES SANDY and track the leading pair, chased the leading trio down the back straight and around the far turn,
and emptied out in the lane. FEELING DANGEROUS was bumped between horses into the first turn as a result of FUTURE VISION coming out, chased
behind the tracking flight, continued midfield through the far turn, and weakened in the lane. CHRISTIAN C bobbled at the break and was bumped by
GAGOOTS in the opening strides, settled back two wide in the trailing pair, was taken under protective hold in upper stretch and eased, was joined by an
outrider approaching the wire, dismounted near the wire, and was vanned off the course. THE RIDER OF KRAMDEN CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE
RIDER OF BIG PINES SANDY, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE INTO THE FIRST TURN. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE BASED ON
THAT CLAIM OF FOUL. IN ADDITION, THE STEWARDS PERFORMED AN INQUIRY INTO THE BEHAVIOR OF BEHAVIN MYSELF INTO THE
