Footnotes
STRICTLY CONFIDENT dueled for the lead from three wide through the final turn then took a slight lead at the eighth pole and cleared late. AWESOME
CAJUN dueled for the lead from between horses and fought gamely to the wire. UXMAL dueled for the lead from the inside to deep stretch and faded.
LITTLE ROCKY tracked the leaders from off the rail through the final turn move out to four wide in upper stretch but was no match for the dueling trio. BAY
BE GONE was allowed to settle in the early stages made a rail bid on the backstretch and flattened out. NOISE COMPLAINT was in the middle of the pace
just off the rail but failed to menace. MY STORY was never a factor.

SUCRE went to the front to take a clear lead from off the rail and was kept to task. APHRODITES REVENGE raced in the middle of the pack from the
inside, made a rail bid into the final turn to prove second best. CAJUN SHOTS raced near the back to the final turn then made a rail bid on the turn to be
best of the rest. PRETTY PRODUCTION was unhurried around the first turn and down the backstretch, went four wide in upper stretch to improve her
position. BE A BANDIT stalked the pace from the three path to mid way down the backstretch and retreated. BLUE RIDGE HEAT tracked the leaders for a
half from the two path and gave way. G'S DEADLINE raced in the middle of the pack from the four path, was taken up on the final turn, pulled up in upper
stretch and was vanned off.

BETTABE BOURBON sprinted to a clear lead and held off outside challenge of HEZA SEXY ZONG for the win. HEZA SEXY ZONG tracked the leader from
the two path, floated out coming out of the turn and just missed. FIELD OF VISION raced near the back to the turn and closed willingly. LOUISIANA FLASH
broke out and bumped STYLING HOOK, saved ground down the backstretch then angled out into the turn to make a mild bid and tired. LITTLE PUCK was
placed off the pace on the inside and faded. WILLIE THE MAN broke in and bumped STYLING HOOK, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside and
failed to menace. FLOWER CAT raced near the back, made a mild bid on the turn and faltered. KING OF CONTRABAND was forwardly placed early in the
three path and gave way. STYLING HOOK was bumped on both sides leaving the gate but was not a factor. KILO KEY was never involved.
