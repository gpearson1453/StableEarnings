Footnotes
PARAMOUR stalked the clear leader, engaged outside of her into the turn, wrestled an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, drew clear in upper stretch
while hanging on her left lead, changed over approaching the final sixteenth, and lasted from a pair of closing in chasers to the wire. JAZZ JAZZ JAZZ took
a nudge from an outer rival at the start, chased along the inside, tipped three wide entering the lane, drifted to the five path in upper stretch, mildly narrowed
the clear leader's margin while drifting a bit further out in midstretch, yet sustained a grinding charge as an outer rival ranged up alongside in the final
sixteenth, but did not have enough to reel in the tiring leader while holding place. ONECALLTHATSALL laid off of the pace in the fie path around the turn,
and stayed on to miss reaching place. TAKEOVER TIME tracked the top pair from the four path, but was outkicked by an outer rival while taking a light
brush from an inner foe in midstretch, and lacked a bid. TAZZHER trailed, then passed tired foes. ONE MO TO GO bumped an inner rival at the start, then
chased two wide and between horses, but gave way turning for home. CONTINENTAL RED broke awkwardly while off a beat slow, yet rushed clear in the
opening stages, showed the way from a prompting rival while a bit off of the rail around the turn, but was headed at the five sixteenth pole, gave way in
upper stretch, and weakened while lugging out through the lane.

Footnotes
WAR TROLLEY prompted the pace along the inside, backed off to stalk approaching the turn, awaited racing room entering the lane, gradually shifted
outside of the top trio in midstretch, and rallied to drive past them in the final sixteenth. LINCOLN PRODUCTION bumped with an inner rival before being
put to a bit of crowded quarters at the start, tracked three wide, engaged the leader two wide at the three furlong pole, pressed between horses turning for
home, vied in upper stretch, wrestled an advantage entering the final sixteenth, but was caught by an outer rival late. FRIEND'S DO CARE set the pace
three wide before clearing inner foes at the half mile pole, showed the way from a pair of bidders entering the lane, resisted through midstretch, but was
headed a sixteenth from home, and yielded. DIGNIFIED N KRAFTY took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, laid off of the pace, gained three wide
around the turn to attempt a bid outside of the top pair entering the lane, but flattened out. MINE YOUR BIZ raced forwardly two wide and between horses
for a furlong, but failed to sustain position at the nine sixteenths pole, and steadily faded. BROTHER JEFF lacked speed in the three path, and never got
involved. WILD FIST bumped an outer rival at the start, lagged behind the field along the inside, then cut the gap through the lane.

RUBIANA was reluctant to load, set a pressured pace along the inside, vied with an outer foe around the turn, shook clear of her entering the lane, and held
firm from a chasing foe through the final furlong. ROSE PALACE stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the clear leader to take aim in midstretch, but
only managed to chase while proving second best. PARKER EVA vied for the lead outside of the eventual winner around the turn, but faded at the quarter
pole. WISE MEMORIES stalked two wide, but drifted out after being asked to tip outside of the top pair at the quarter pole, and yielded. LITTLE FAIRY was

Footnotes
MACHINE GUN MAN set the pace via a clear margin around the turn, shifted a path out in upper stretch, maintained a clear advantage through midstretch,
and held sway from a pursuing rival in the final sixteenth. RALLY BOARD laid off of the pace in the two path, came under a firm hold when inching closer
behind rivals leaving the half mile pole tugged forward along the rail through the turn to bid for place inside of a rival entering the lane, vied for that position
while chasing the clear leader through midstretch, then secured place at the sixteenth pole, and was gaining on the leader late. AMANWALKSINTOABAR
stalked along the inside before tipping outside of the pace setter entering the turn, pursued from between horses around the bend, but failed to gain on the
clear leader entering the lane as an inner rival bid for place, sparred with that foe for that position through midstretch, but yielded at the sixteenth pole, then
narrowly saved place. JULIA'S WARRIOR tracked three wide, faded four wide at the three furlong pole, tucked to the two path nearing the lane, yet
regained stride in upper stretch, stayed on while shifting outside of the leading trio with multiple lengths to find in midstretch, and sustained a charge to just
miss reaching show. CAFE RACER laid off of the pace outside of rivals, tucked from the five path to the two path while trailing at the three furlong pole,
checked when short of rail room leaving the five sixteenths pole, then shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, and surpassed a tiring rival late. WOLF
HUNTER chased two to three wide and between horses, but weakened.

MY ROMEO LIMA stalked two wide, bid turning for home, dueled with his inner game counterpart while being slightly herded out approaching the furlong
grounds, sparred gamely between horses leaving that juncture after GUNTOWN joined the fray, took a brush from his inner rival at the sixteenth pole, yet
kept on and prevailed late. GUNTOWN was bumped by an outer rival into an inner foe at the start, tracked from the two path while under snug restraint
behind foes around the first turn, remained in hand while in the bit between horses around the far turn, smoothly tipped outside of the top pair entering the
lane to take aim, grinded away to bid leaving the furlong pole, battled through the closing stages, but was denied while narrowly reaching place. GLOBAL
SENSATION set the pace in the two path, met the eventual winner's bid turning for home, dueled while shifting out slightly leaving the three sixteenths pole,
clung to an advantage as another outer rival bid leaving midstretch, but brushed his most immediate counterpart at the sixteenth pole, and was bested late.
RIGHT TONE rated at the rear two wide, took the far turn in the four path before coming into the lane five wide, and stayed on to reach fourth leaving the
furlong pole, and chased the leading trio home. PATH TO SUCCESS broke a step slowly before being bumped by an outer rival at the start, stalked along
the inside, but only managed to chase to midstretch before yielding. OLD SOT bobbled slightly at the start, laid far back along the inside, took the far turn in
the three path, and made little impact. C FALLS bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked three wide, but weakened once floated four wide entering the
lane.

Footnotes
IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT tracked along the inside, inched closer in the three path and between horses around the far turn, bid outside of the new leader in
upper stretch, dueled with that foe through the final furlong, and prevailed. SOCIAL AFLEET tracked from off of the pace three wide, gained approaching the
far turn, kicked past the tiring leader with a quarter mile to go, but met IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT's bid in upper stretch, sparred gamely with that foe through
the final furlong, but was bested. UNWANTED INTRUDER laid off of the pace along the inside, gained in the five path and outside of foes around the far
turn, then stayed on to chase the top pair home. GUITAR TRIBUTE stalked along the inside while a bit off of the rail, tipped to three path and between
horses entering the lane, but only managed to chase on his left lead. I'M D'CAT tracked two wide and between horses, but yielded at the three furlong pole,
tucked soon after, then failed to menace along the rail through the lane. ZENUCCI rated far back along the inside, then two wide around the far turn before
swinging six wide entering the lane, but offered no rally. LOUISIANA MOON trailed in the two path, and surpassed tired foes. THREE RUN HOMER ran off
and opened up a wide margin while well off of the rail around the first turn, failed to resist a challenge turning for home, and wilted between horses through
the lane. GREY SLOAN broke a step slowly, raced far back in the four path, improved to midpack down the backstretch, but faded turning for home.
