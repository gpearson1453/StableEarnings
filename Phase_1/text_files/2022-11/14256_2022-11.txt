Footnotes
BROBRO CORMAN was away alertly to set the pace on the inside and drew away on the turn and then drew off in the stretch to prove best under a mild
drive. BOOK RUNNER broke in a tangle at the start, then came up the inside to chase the pace, shifted out on the turn and was four wide by the quarter
pole and failed to gain on the winner, second best. MR. JEKYLL tracked the pace between rivals and weakened, bested rest. CHIEF BULLET ran off about
a half mile pre race, then tracked the pace on the outside and tired. ECLIPTICAL DAVID showed little.

ASLUCKWOULDHAVIT set the early pace and then was headed on the turn and then turned back that bid and shook clear leaving the turn and held on to
prove best, driving. DEVIOUS MO was rated early and was four wide on the turn, made a five wide bid leaving the turn and could not get to the winner,
second best. MY MAGICAL MAN chased the early pace on the inside, angled out in the drive and was along for the show award. SPIN CYCLE tracked the
pace and saved ground on the turn but had no kick in the drive, lost show award late. GEM JUAN was reserved early while wide and had a belated rally. E
T'S CANDY MAN stalked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command and then was empty. BAVARIA dropped back.

FUELED UP was away alertly to set the pace while clear, then turned back a bid by the quarter pole, drifted out through the stretch and remained clear to
prove best under a drive. CEETA tracked the pace three wide and then was shuffled back nearing the quarter pole, then came again late to gain thr place
award. SEARCH was rated along early on the inside, advanced on the turn but had to check by the five sixteenths, then made a inside bid leaving the turn
but hung late. RIPPA was reserved early, three wide on the turn and then had a belated rally. MS KAYS COWGIRL was reserved early, two wide on the turn
and had no rally. SOULSTONE was settled early, made a bold four wide move and loomed boldly by the quarter pole but then came up empty. TIMES
