Footnotes
ABBIE'S WAY lagged early, advanced around the turn, closed willingly and wore down her rivals to get up late. TIZ WONDERFULLY got away alertly,
pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, assumed command, drew off for a clear lead, led to deep stretch and was outclosed to finish second
best. FIRE DIAMONDS was pinched back and steadied at the start, swung wide leaving the turn, found her best stride late and was gaining ground.
BONITA RAPIDS raced in the back, went widest in the drive and finished well while not a threat. AND I KNOW broke in and was steadied at the start and
raced mid pack in even effort. SWEET HONOR was outrun in an even effort. ELEGANT CRICKET set a pressured pace to the turn, fell back, weakened
and faded through the stretch. DIXIE RED pressed the pace while racing between horses, was through early, gave way and not urged late.

Footnotes
GORKY PARK was never far back, rallied around the turn, bid willingly, dueled late and was all out at the wire. HEY SEQUOIA was unhurried early, swung
wide entering the stretch, found his best stride late, was gaining ground and got up at the wire for place. NORTHERN QUEST advanced to the turn, bid
inside, dueled late and was outfinished in a game effort. HAVEULOSTYOURMIND was slow early, closed along the rail, gained late but didn't have enough
left. FULL DRAW stalked the pace, challenged three across on the turn, was carried out entering the stretch, fell back and lacked the needed late rally.
PROVOST vied two across, assumed command on the turn, inched away and faltered near the sixteenth pole to lose position. BLESSED JOURNEY failed
to menace in an even effort. REALLY SLOW was not a factor. RINGS OF SATURN set a pressured pace to the second turn, tired, stopped, was eased and
walked off.

Footnotes
MISS GLORIOUS stalked the pace, was steadied entering the turn, assumed command, drew off for a clear lead and held safely. V BUCKS raced close to
the pace, bid inside on the turn, shifted out, lacked the needed late rally and was no match for the winner. MISS IMPORTANT was void of early speed, went
widest in the drive, found her best stride and got up for show. DYNAMIC MIMI was taken outside, raced mid pack, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a
bid.. FIRST PROMISE showed speed to the second turn and flattened out. LARIMAR raced mid pack in an even effort. MISSCZECH had brief speed only.
FIRE ESCAPE veered in at the start, bid inside on the turn angled out, had the rider lose the whip and dropped back. A ROZE AND WINE led to the turn,
dropped back, weakened in the drive and faded. WITH THATBEINGSAID was off slowly, raced inside and showed little.

Footnotes
J T'S A. T. M. set the pace, drew off on the turn for a long lead and held while kept to task. EL MAESTRO raced close to the pace, bid between horses on
the turn, closed steadily to narrow the gap and finished second best. ALLEVA bumped at the start, raced in the back, went wide in the drive, finished well
and gained late. HOTFOOT was never far back, lacked a rally and failed to menace. SANTALUZ DREAMIN raced close to the pace, swung wide entering
the stretch, fell back and finished evenly. BAPTISM pressed the pace inside to the turn, fell back, weakened and faded through the stretch. EXHILARATOR
was not a factor. SINGANDCRYINDUBAI pressed the pace to the turn and gave way. WE MISS GENO bumped at the start and trailed the field.

Footnotes
NOBLE PURSUIT was void of early speed, went eight wide at the top of the stretch, closed steadily and inched away near the sixteenth pole. BOB'S ALL IN
was slow early, got through along the rail on the turn, dueled to the sixteenth pole and yielded. MOVE OVER (GB) was never far back, went five wide
entering the stretch, dueled for the lead, had the rider lose his whip, yielded and just lasted for show. MOSQUITO FLEET got away well, led around the first
turn, vied to mid stretch, was unable to sustain his bid and was outnodded for third. TIGER BY HIS TAIL raced close to the pace, went seven wide entering
the stretch and lacked the needed late rally. GRAY MAGICIAN raced in the second flight along the inside, lacked a bid and was outrun. BIGFOOT CITY
challenged three across entering the backstretch to vie to the turn and flattened out. MIAMI CROCKETT challenged between horses entering the
backstretch, stopped entering the second turn and was not urged late. Hand timed.
