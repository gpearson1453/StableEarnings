SWEET ANNABELLA stalked off the rail, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced at a close disadvantage through the far turn, but dug in determinedly
to take the nod in the final yards. MAYSVILLE MISS moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, contested
the rail on the far turn and dug in under steady handling through the lane, but was caught in the final yards. I B NASTY saved ground, bid leaving the three
eighths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, then flattened inside the eighth pole. SAKARI stalked from the two and three paths, gave chase leaving
the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little in the lane. HOWSAFEAREMYCOLORS settled off the rail, picked up the chase
past the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little more. KOBE'S GIRL rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase leaving
the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, eased outward into the lane but showed little more.

held on well under steady handling. AWESOME INCENTIVE settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced
near the rail on the far turn and dug in through the stretch to hold on for second. SOME IS NINE rounded the opening turn in the five path, started a bid
leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and finished well while gaining on the runner-up. PRACTICALLY THERE saved ground
well off the early pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn then eased out into the lane and passed some rivals.

flattened the final sixteenth. COUNTRY MAGIC stalked the early pace inside, started a three wide bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five
path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. AT THE HALF rounded the first turn in the six path and entered the backstretch outside, gave chase toward

factored. BET THE QUEEN broke through the gate prior the start, rounded the first turn about the three path and was not a factor.

three eighths pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and held well under steady stretch handling. COMEONTURNMELOOSE saved ground on the first turn,
started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, then dug in from the eighth pole to take second the final yards. MONKEY

pole. MISTER DEEKS rounded the first turn in the four path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced in the four and five paths of the far turn then
passed rivals in the lane. CRISTIANO BOY rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far
turn then flattened in the lane. BOBBYS CASE LOAD exchanged contact with Allegheny Hero soon after the start then saved ground on the first turn, picked
up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and weakened into the lane. GOLDEN METTLE settled back off the rail the first
turn and showed little response through the backstretch. ROCKET BALLAD rounded the first turn about the five path, picked up the chase from the three
eighths pole then flattened in the six path of the far turn. ALLEGHENY HERO was jostled early then rated close off the rail on the first turn, gave chase from

STRONG LIL KOKORO settled off the rail the first turn, started a bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn, dug in for
the lead inside the sixteenth pole and edged clear later yards. THEWITCHISGONE raced with the pace two deep then took the nod into the backstretch,
showed the way and contested the edge through the far turn, was met mid-stretch, relented later yards and just lasted for second. LEG UP stalked off the
rail the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn, finished well and just missed second. ROCKET'S
CASTLE raced with the pace inside, was met into the backstretch and engaged in close chase from that point, contested at a slim disadvantage nearest the
rail on the far turn then weakened the final sixteenth. CHASE LIL ME rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase from the half mile pole and raced in
the three path of the far turn, but proved empty in the lane. S S ALASKAN CRUZ saved early ground racing well back, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, angled out toward the head of the lane and weakened. MR CHANCE ROMANCE rated close to the early

Footnotes
BREADMAN'S ROSEBUD rounded the first turn about the four path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced six wide on the far turn and
finished strong to get up the final yards. SAYYESTOTHELADY settled in the two and three paths the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole and
raced close three wide on the far turn, dueled to a slim brief lead mid-stretch but was caught in the final yards. YOLO CHARLOTTE rounded the first turn in
the four path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and came along for third the final yards.
WINDSOR'S PLAY stalked off the rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, took a brief lead into the stretch
but was met a sixteenth away and flattened stride. AIM'S JUBILEE saved early ground, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole and raced in the
three path on the far turn, was eased to the five path entering the stretch and finished evenly. DIXIE YODELER rated close inside on the first turn, gave
chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then flattened later yards. CEDAR'S WISH surged clear and angled to the inside to rate
the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, kept the edge at the rail on the far turn but was met into the lane, continued close to
mid-stretch then weakened. ELIANAGRACE raced well back in the three path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
about the three path and flattened in the lane. BAYS CASTLE raced well back off the rail on the first turn and bid only mildly from the seven sixteenths pole.
LONG LEGS LOUISE mostly saved ground.
