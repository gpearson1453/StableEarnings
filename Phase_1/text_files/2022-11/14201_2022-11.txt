Footnotes
LIQUIDATOR , taken to rate early, edged up three wide into the turn and tracked a contested pace, moved to the attack three deep with a quarter to go,
spurted clear when rouse past the three sixteenths, switched over to her correct lead inside the furlong grounds and dug in gamely to turn back COAL
MINE. COAL MINE drafted back off the early pace, dropped in some and advanced between runners leaving the five eighths, set up shop right behind a
three pronged battle past the five sixteenths, swung out four wide for the drive, rolled up outside the winner nearing the sixteenth marker, kept on willingly
but was denied. ANGELOFCANTERBURY stalked the early pace, moved up outside the leader and applied pressure into the turn, dueled between runners
leaving the five sixteenths, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded. FANCEE GRACE C sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, braced for a
challenge into the turn, sparred from the three eighths to upper stretch then gave in with a furlong remaining. LARAMORE saved ground in range early on,
dropped back around the turn then lacked a stretch punch. RIDE THE RAPIDS lost ground four wide, made a mild move to contention nearing the turn,
remained four wide pursuing past the five sixteenths and faded. BODACIOUS BREN , off the pace, angled out around the turn and gave way.

SUPREME LAW , unhurried in the three path between horses around the turn, advanced outside TAKE CHARGE TOO to take command in mid stretch then
eagerly drew off. HERE AND NOFURTHER , four deep around the turn, was no threat to the winner in the drive and gained the place. TAKE CHARGE TOO
pulled his way into contention leaving the backstretch, gained a two wide lead leaving the turn and weakened late. BOURBON ON THE BAY lacked speed,
swung to the four path in upper stretch, raced outside foes and passed tired ones. FRONT DANCER set the pace along the rail on the turn and gave way
through the stretch. GLASTONBURY raced along the inner rail on the turn and retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
SICILIA MIKE drafted back off foes entering the backstretch, dropped in and gained inside a pair of rivals near the half mile marker, came back off the rail
and edged up under a hustling ride to take aim of the leader leaving the five sixteenths, bid three wide outside HONOR THE FLEET to take command past
the three sixteenths and drew away strongly while kept to task. CURLINGTON bobbled at the break, recovered and moved up to be between runners early,
chased two wide past the half, continued a few paths off the rail into the lane and churned on with interest to be second best. HONOR THE FLEET
advanced three wide outside a rival to take command past the seven eighths, was tough to settle through the backstretch run and opened up a lengthy
advantage, continued to show the way two wide into the lane, failed to contain the winner leaving the three sixteenths and weakened. SHOOT
THEMESSENGER , three deep heading to the far turn, lacked a response. ITSKNOWNASTHEBERN broke a step slow, was sent up between rivals soon
after to hold a brief lead, ceded to HONOR THE FLEET, gave brief chase and retreated.

Footnotes
SHAOLIN , just off the pace down the backstretch, moved up in the three path between horses entering the far turn, bid for the lead mid way on the bend,
dueled inside RED WINE TIME through the stretch and narrowly prevailed in an extended drive. RED WINE TIME broke slowly, was four wide the first turn,
advanced five deep to challenge for the lead mid way on the far turn, dueled outside the winner, remained on her left lead in the stretch, drifted out late and
just missed. TORRE BRANCA lacked speed, remained inside horses down the backstretch, eased out on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch
and rallied outside horses. GOGO CHANEL , four wide the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced in the four path between horses to
challenge for the lead leaving the far turn then flattened out. MUSICAL CAT , four wide into the first turn, was three wide turning for home and failed to rally.
SWEET SENSATION disputed the pace outside EARLEY ROSE and weakened. EARLEY ROSE stumbled soon after the break, hugged the inner rail while
disputing the pace for five furlongs and gave way. LOTTACLASS LILSASS trailed and was kept wide around the far turn.

Footnotes
JASONTAKESLONG prompted the pace two wide outside LORD MIO, took command in hand leaving the far turn then spurted clear, entered the lane two
wide and under pressure, kept on under strong handling past mid stretch and kept DOWN COLD at bay to his inside. DOWN COLD rated close up between
rivals past the five eighths, dropped in towards the rail leaving the three eighths to chase, got through along the rail to challenge the winner past mid stretch,
fought gamely but wasn't quite good enough. BURGEE rated in range while saving ground, was shuffled back due to a tiring rival leaving the three eighths,
shifted out to move up between foes, angled four wide into the lane, ranged up outside in mid stretch but one paced late. SPEAK UNITY was used five wide
outside rivals to reach contention past the seven eighths, stalked four wide into the far turn, was under pressure pursuing into the lane but came up empty in
the final furlong. MAJESTIC FRONTIER settled off the pace while saving ground, edged up near the half mile marker, came off the inside leaving the far
turn, swung out for the final furlong and had a mild kick. CALLOWAY PEAK saved ground, swung out for the drive but lacked a bid. SHADY MUNNI , three
to four wide, raced in range to the far turn and weakened. LORD MIO set a pressured pace towards the rail, ceded command leaving the far turn and
faltered. BRANCO MARIA , off the pace, angled well wide for the drive but failed to menace. SIR TERRE broke a step slow, lost ground five wide around the
first turn, made a four wide run under asking past the three eighths, chased and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
FILLE D'ESPRIT , away alertly, drafted back off the leaders soon after and relaxed nicely, picked up the pace past the three eighths and cruised up three to
four wide to engage the leaders, struck the top entering the lane, responded to rousing and quickly widened in mid stretch, was kept alert with one ask of the
left stick then was geared down through the final strides. JUROR NUMBER FOUR , off the pace while saving ground, took closer order mid turn, eased out
into the lane, worked her way between rivals in mid stretch and kept on with good energy to be second best. HOLLYWOOD WALK rated in range and
outside a rival mid turn, swung four wide into the lane, had aim past the three sixteenths then flattened out. PAISLEY SINGING rated two wide outside
TARGE, moved to apply more pressure mid turn, sparred between rivals approaching the stretch, stayed on to about mid stretch then gave way. TARGE
was sent between foes soon after the break and took command, set the pace towards the rail, took pressure leaving the three eighths, was under a strong
ride trying to hold position nearing the lane, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and weakened.

Footnotes
LUV U MARY JANE moved up in the two path leaving the turn, secured command near the quarter pole then drew off under steady handling. ITSY BITSY
IZZIE , between horses on the turn, angled to the five path in upper stretch, lugged in near the eighth pole and gained the place. TRES MARIA'S DREAM
saved ground on the turn, swung to the four path entering the stretch and flattened out. ICESTORMING showed speed along the inner rail and weakened in
the drive. RUXTON ROCKS lacked speed, hugged the inner rail on the turn and failed to be a factor. MEET ME AT SUNSET was outrun. SISTER SPIRIT
prompted the pace, circled the turn three wide, was floated out turning for home and faltered.
