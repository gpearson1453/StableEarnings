on the far turn, dug in to take second mid-stretch, but hung late strides and just lasted for second. AIR MEDAL raced well back saving early ground, bid
toward the five sixteenths pole and was eased to the five path on the far turn, finished well to gain on the top two and just missed second. S S ALASKAN

the three eighths but was met midway on the far turn and weakened nearing mid-stretch. MEGALODON'SREVENGE raced wide on both turns and never
