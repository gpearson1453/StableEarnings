Footnotes
GET'EM TIGER disputed the early pace, took up in tight quarters entering the turn, re-rallied approaching the top of the lane, assumed command in upper
stretch, drove clear nearing the furlong pole and kept to task in the final sixteenth. A DIME FOR ME took back off of the early quick pace, raced two wide
into the turn, waited for racing room nearing the quarter marker, slipped to the inside in upper stretch, shifted out inside of the furlong grounds, was
outkicked in deep stretch and was second best in the end. TRULY FABULOUS bobbled leaving the start and was away a step slowly, chased the early
speed outside of rivals, came four wide into the drive, could not impact the top two late and was clear for third in the end. TRAFFIC STOPPER broke alertly,
showed good early speed and established a narrow early advantage, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, was overtaken leaving the turn and faded
in the drive. TAKES A VILLAGE was forwardly placed into the turn, pressed the quick pace to the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and gave
way.

Footnotes
MISO FAST was allowed to settle, was well placed through the turn while saving ground, loomed in upper stretch, closed fast in deep stretch and made a
late surge in the final strides to prevail. QUIET CHARM showed early speed after an alert beginning, set quick fractions through the turn, was pressed to the
quarter marker, shook free nearing the furlong marker, was confronted by MISO FAST in deep stretch, battled against the winner in the final strides and was
gamely bested, while holding safely in the end for place. WHOA BUDDY rated off of the early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, swung five wide into
the drive, raced on the left lead in deep stretch and was outkicked, while clear for show. ZERO BUCKS GIVEN broke alertly, tracked the early pace, pressed
QUIET CHARM along the turn, drifted out a bit nearing the top of the lane, lost position in upper stretch and weakened. EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER
encountered traffic in the early going while tracking the early pace, came three wide into the turn, swung four wide for the drive and did not produce a late
rally. TWIRLING DERBY lacked early speed, trailed to the quarter marker and did not factor in the late stages.

Footnotes
PRINCESS ADALEIGH showed good early speed leaving the break, dictated terms to the turn, was well handled to the quarter marker, was roused in upper
stretch, drew clear to the furlong marker and drew away in the late stages under a steady hand ride. TAMANTARI lunged at the start and was off a bit
slowly, raced four wide on the turn, was no match for the winner in the drive and kept on in deep stretch to be second best. LA PRIMER ESTRELLA chased
the pacesetter from the rail, lost ground leaving the turn, was outfinished for second in deep stretch and held safely for third in the end.
GUNGAGUNGAGALUNGA was forwardly placed early on, stalked the fast fractions through the turn, could not match strides with PRINCESS ADALEIGH in
upper stretch and faded. NOT NOW I'M BIZZIE lacked early speed, saved ground to the top of the lane and was not a late factor. TWO TWELVE chased
the fast early pace, raced three wide into the turn, was outrun in upper stretch and tired in the final stages.

the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed determinedly in deep stretch and made a late surge in the final strides to prevail. AUTISM BLUE showed early
speed and established the early pace, was pressed through the turn while setting quick fractions, shook free nearing the furlong marker, was confronted by
MR NAVIGATOR in deep stretch, met that foe's bid to the final yards and was gamely bested, while holding for place. SIERRA MELODY stalked the quick
early pace, came three wide along the turn, lost ground nearing mid-stretch, finished well in the final sixteenth, could not reel in the top pair late and was up
for show in the final strides. KNOCKOUT BERT rated off of the quick early pace, saved ground while advancing nearing the top of the lane, came within aim
in mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final stages and was just edged for show. THAT'S BIND BABE was allowed to settle in the early going, advanced two
wide on the turn, made a steady bid nearing mid-stretch, came in tight and lacked room in deep stretch and was outfinished late. MARQUE IT UP was
hustled to be forwardly placed, pressed the quick pace to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened. HARBOR KITTY lacked early
speed, saved ground to the top of the lane and did not threaten in the drive.

swung out in upper stretch, was full of run in the drive, overtook FUENTE just inside of the sixteenth-marker and kept to task in the late stages to prevail.
FUENTE (GB) was forwardly placed early on, stalked the moderate fractions from a three wide position, advanced to vie for the lead nearing the quarter
marker, took a narrow edge to mid-stretch, could not hold off the quickly oncoming SHOTGUN EXPRESS in deep stretch and just held for second in the
final strides. BEROLIJEAN (FR) saved ground while settling off of the early pace, raced in the second flight to the far turn, navigated traffic in the drive,
finished well in deep stretch, just missed for place in the final strides and held safely for show in the end. DEALERS HAND broke in the air and was away
slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, came two wide into the backstretch run, improved position nearing the quarter marker, swung five wide for the
drive and made a steady late bid in the final sixteenth. BRONZE WARRIOR broke alertly and was sent to contest the early lead, set a pressured pace while
carving out moderate fractions, was confronted nearing the quarter marker, battled for the lead to the furlong marker and weakened in the late stages. JEDI
KNIGHT showed early speed and prompted the moderate fractions, kept close attendance through the backstretch run, vied for the lead nearing the top of
the lane, battled to mid-stretch and gave way in the final sixteenth. EAST RAND stalked the early pace while just off of the rail, maintained position through
the backstretch run, lost position on the second turn and lacked a response in the stretch run. SYNC was allowed to settle, came three wide into the
backstretch run, improved position nearing the half-mile marker, dropped back on the second turn and did not offer a late rally.

THREAD COUNT was well placed in the early stages, raced close up to the pace while saving ground into the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, made a
determined late rally nearing the sixteenth-marker, overtook FOURTH STREET in deep stretch and kept to task late to prevail. FOURTH STREET broke
alertly and showed good early speed, took a narrow lead to the turn, set fast fractions to the quarter marker, drew clear to mid-stretch, was all out in the final
sixteenth but could not hold off the determined winner and held well in the end for place. MISS BELLIMBUSTO was allowed to settle in the early going,
came two wide into the turn, swung three wide for the drive, closed well inside of the furlong marker and was up for show in the final strides. ROSE OF
MOONCOIN showed early speed and pressed the fast early pace, kept pressure on the pacesetter to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch,
weakened in the drive and was edged for third in the final strides. A ROUSING BABE lacked early speed, raced from the back entering the turn, saved
ground to the top of the lane, shifted out in upper stretch, found her best stride late and challenged for show in deep stretch. BIG SIS LITTLE SIS tracked
the fast early pace from the second flight, raced three wide into the turn, gained ground approaching the quarter marker, could not keep pace nearing
mid-stretch and lacked a late rally. CAHUILLA chased the early pace from towards the rear, improved position on the turn while two wide, could not sustain
that run in the stretch and gave way. DUST MAKER hopped at the start and was away slowly, was a bit green in the run into the turn, chased the pace from
the inside to the top of the lane and tired in the final furlong. GET MY POINT chased the pace to the turn, raced outside of rivals while losing ground nearing
the quarter marker, came five wide into the drive and did not offer a late response. STANDFORGRIT showed early speed and was forwardly placed into the
turn, dropped back while three then four wide on the turn and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
MOMMA MOCCA was allowed to settle in the early going, was well placed while in the second flight through the backstretch run, gained ground nearing the
top of the lane, was roused two wide in upper stretch, assumed command inside of the furlong marker and kept to task in the final sixteenth. MADEIRA
WINE broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set decent fractions while on a clear lead through the backstretch run, was well handled into the second
turn, kept a narrow advantage to mid-stretch, was overtaken by MOMMA MOCCA inside of the furlong marker and held for second in the final strides.
BANDEENA was reserved in the early stages, saved ground to the second turn, angled out in upper stretch, closed willingly in the final furlong, just missed
for second in the final strides and held for show in the end. STOIC LUNA was allowed to settle, came three wide into the backstretch run, made a three wide
bid nearing the top of the stretch, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was outkicked in the final stages. ALWAYS SEEKING was forwardly placed in the early
stages, tracked the decent fractions through the backstretch run, raced three then four wide on the second turn, lost position in upper stretch and did not
offer a late response. VINCERO GRANDE stumbled leaving the start and was off slowly, was fanned four to five wide entering the first turn then settled in
the three path heading into the backstretch, improved position nearing the far turn, was steered three then four wide approaching the stretch run and did not
produce a late rally. MISTY CAT was unhurried in the early going, came three to four wide into the second turn, swung widest into the drive to be six wide in
upper stretch and did not factor late. SHEZAGHOST stalked the early pace from a three wide path, maintained position to the half-mile marker, advanced
four wide nearing the quarter pole, swung five wide for the drive, was outrun approaching mid-stretch and faded late.

Footnotes
TOP HARBOR tracked the early moderate pace, came in tight and checked off of heels leaving the three-furlong pole, raced along the inside to the quarter
marker, was roused two wide nearing the top of the lane, closed determinedly in mid-stretch, wore down IRREFUTABLE in the final stages and held in a
drive at the end to prevail. IRREFUTABLE broke sharply and assumed command of the early pace, set moderate early fractions while pressed to the quarter
marker, shook free in upper stretch, met the bid of TOP HARBOR nearing the furlong grounds, was gamely bested by the winner in deep stretch and held
safely in the end for second. PSYCHO DAR showed early speed, pressed the moderate pace two then three wide on the turn, vied for the lead nearing the
top of the lane, lost ground in upper stretch, was outfinished inside of the furlong marker and held for show in the final strides. COOL MOUNTAIN LAD was
a bit hard to load, chased the pace to the turn, raced two wide into the bend, swung four wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was outkicked in
the final stages. RAGER chased the moderate pace from a two wide position, advanced inside of the furlong marker and was outkicked late. BOBBY'S
ALIBI chased from the inside through the turn, gained ground in mid-stretch and was outclosed in the final sixteenth. TORPEDO AWAY was forwardly
placed into the first turn, stalked the moderate fractions three wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive and faded in the late stages.

Footnotes
TIZ VICIOUS was reserved for the first quarter mile, awaited some room going into the turn, was stuck behind horses while full of run through the turn,
swung out to the four-path and was briefly running on the wrong lead entering the stretch, then surged to the front and pulled away under brisk hand ride.
FLY BUDDY FLY last in the early stages, bided his time through the turn, had clear run at the top of the stretch and ran on well to grab the place while never
a serious threat to the winner. EL CHARRO CHAMP broke well and was up with the dueling leaders early, eased off the speed duel then launched a bid
from the three-furlong pole, ran on well but was out finished late. CLASS PROOF away well, dueled with TIME IS GONE to deep stretch, held a brief lead
and finished with good courage but tired nearing the finish. RHODIUM RUNNER was always prominent from the inside, tracked the dueling leaders through
the turn, waited for racing room to mid-stretch but lacked the needed response once clear. TIME IS GONE fastest into stride, dueled with CLASS PROOF
through the turn, dueled with that one to deep stretch then weakened in the final furlong. TEXAS LONHRO tracked the leaders from the outside, remained in
the three or four path through the turn while making a mild gain but was through after a half and finished wide down the stretch.
