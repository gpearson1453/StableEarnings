Footnotes
REFI NOW was forwardly placed early on, tracked the solid pace from just off of the rail, was roused two wide nearing the quarter marker, battled with
EVENEREVENWORSE to mid-stretch, overtook that foe inside of the furlong marker and held sway over the oncoming runner-up in the final sixteenth. OUR
EXPECTATION rated off of the early pace, came two wide between rivals into the turn, mounted a three wide rally in upper stretch, closed well in deep
stretch, was held at bay by the determined winner in the final sixteenth and was second best. EVENEREVENWORSE showed early speed, set solid
fractions while tracked by the winner through the turn, held off REFI NOW to mid-stretch, was overtaken by that foe inside of the furlong marker, weakened
in the final stages and held for third in the end. SATANTA saved ground while settling off of the early pace and did not produce a late rally. SIERRA
MELODY chased the early speed outside of rivals, came four wide into the drive and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
UNION GIG broke in good order and disputed the quick early fractions, pressed the pacesetter midway through the turn, took command in upper stretch,
drew to a clear lead nearing mid-stretch and pulled away under a hand ride in the late stages. RANCHO RED rated off of the early fractions, saved ground
to the quarter marker, tipped out two wide for the drive, was no match for the winner in the final stages and kept on to be best of the rest. MANY
AMBITIONS was allowed to settle, came three wide to the top of the lane, did not mount a late rally in the drive but stayed on to be well clear for show. DR.
FLASH DANCER tracked the quick early fractions while outside of rivals, came five wide into the drive and passed tiring foes late. JUST WATCH ME NOW
tracked the early speed four wide, ran in pursuit to the quarter marker, lost position in upper stretch and gave way. FIRST STYLE was sent to contest the
early lead among a host of rivals in the opening stages, set quick fractions while pressed by the winner, was overtaken leaving the turn and tired in the
stretch. GOOD FOCUS was forwardly placed in the early stages, gained ground three wide on the bend, dropped back in upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
MCGEORGE lacked early speed while content to trail in the early stages, saved ground to the quarter marker, tipped out two wide in upper stretch, closed
with a rush while navigating traffic inside of the furlong marker, overtook HAY JUAN in deep stretch and held his stablemate at bay in the final strides to
prevail. DIAMOND RANGER tracked the loose pacesetter through fast early fractions, chased HAY JUAN to mid-stretch, closed the gap on that rival inside
of the sixteenth-marker, was outclosed by his stablemate in the final strides and held for place in the end. HAY JUAN was sent to the early lead, set fast
fractions while loose on the lead on the turn, maintained a long lead to mid-stretch, was all out in deep stretch, could not hold off the oncoming top pair and
held for show in the final strides. CONTINENTAL UNION was unhurried, raced three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch run, closed willingly in
deep stretch and challenged late for the minor awards. ROYAL JESTER tracked the quick early fractions from the second flight, swung four wide into the
drive, found his best stride late and was outfinished in the final sixteenth. GORDY'S BOY rated off of the pace, came three wide to the top of the lane, was
gaining in the final furlong but was not a threat in the final stages. ZERO BUCKS GIVEN settled off of the fast early pace, saved ground through the turn and
was not a late factor.

Footnotes
MY SPY tracked the early pacesetter, raced two wide on the turn, overtook the tiring pacesetter leaving the turn, was confronted by NENE ROMANO
nearing the furlong marker, dueled with that game rival through deep stretch and determinedly prevailed in the final strides. NENE ROMANO tracked the
solid early pace, was roused three wide nearing the quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch, confronted MY SPY in mid-stretch, dueled through the final
furlong with that determined foe and was gamely bested in the final strides, while besting the rest. COUSIN NIECEY rated off of the early pace while in the
second flight, came two wide along the turn, swung four wide into the drive, was outkicked by the top pair in deep stretch and stayed on well late to be clear
for show. CLUBHOUSE WAVE settled off of the early solid pace, saved ground while advancing on the turn, continued that bid to mid-stretch and lacked the
needed late response. TEXAS CHARM was allowed to settle, came two wide along the turn and was not a late threat. LIL'S BIG SHOT broke awkwardly
and spotted the field leaving the start, lacked early speed, saved ground to the top of the lane and was not a factor. LADY BRETT stumbled at the break but
recovered nicely and was hustled to contest the early lead, set solid fractions while on a clear lead nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace in the
drive and faltered in the late stages.

Footnotes
IDA CLAIRE was allowed to settle in the early stages, was well placed through the backstretch run, roused two wide nearing the quarter marker, mounted a
three wide bid in upper stretch, wore down foes inside of the furlong marker and edged away in the final strides to prevail. VIRULENTE (FR) stalked the
moderate fractions while keeping an inside path, made a two wide move on the far turn to challenge the pacesetter, battled with HARBOR ABBEY to
mid-stretch, shook free from that rival nearing the sixteenth marker, could not hold off the quickly oncoming winner in deep stretch and held for place in the
final strides. CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) was away a bit slowly, was rank in the run along the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run, saved
ground to the second turn, angled out in upper stretch, closed well inside of the furlong marker and was up for third in the final sixteenth. HARBOR ABBEY
broke alertly and established the early lead, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run while well rated, was confronted leaving the second turn,
battled against VIRULENTE to mid-stretch, steadied when that one drifted in in deep stretch and stubbornly gave way in the final stages. DR WYSONG was
allowed to settle, raced two wide into the backstretch run, came four wide along the far turn and was not a threat in the stretch. LIBERTY LIBERTY stalked
the moderate early fractions, maintained position through the backstretch run, lost ground three wide on the far turn and faded in the stretch run.

HADLEES HONOR was reserved in the early stages, improved position while well placed on the far turn, chased the leaders to mid-stretch, was full of run in
deep stretch, split foes inside of the sixteenth-marker and kept to task in the final stages to prevail. GROSS PROFIT tracked the solid early fractions while
two wide, lost position on the far turn, came four wide in upper stretch, finished well in the final sixteenth, was bumped by LIBERTY WOLF when that rival
drifted out in deep stretch and was up for place in the final strides. LOOKSGOODONYOUTHO was keen to go on in the early stages and set the pace into
the backstretch run, set quick fractions to the half-mile marker, drew clear to the quarter marker and drew off nearing mid-stretch, was all out in the final
sixteenth, was overtaken by the winner in deep stretch and was just edged for place while dead-heating for the show. LIBERTY WOLF hit the gate at the
start and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early stages while racing two wide, improved position along the rail on the far turn, made a grinding advance
inside of the furlong marker, came in tight in deep stretch, drifted out under left handed-urging, bumped GROSS PROFIT and was up in the final strides to
dead-heat for the show. PURPLE NIGHT was forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the fast pace to the second turn, came three wide into the drive,
could not keep pace with LOOKSGOODONYOUTHO nearing mid-stretch, closed ground in deep stretch and was outfinished in the final stages, while just
missing for the minor awards. JAZZY LOVE tracked the solid early fractions from the second flight, lost ground three wide on the second turn and gave way.
SPORTS FOR WOMEN was shuffled at the start, allowed to settle, raced just off of the rail to the second turn, came five wide into upper stretch and did not
factor in the late stages. ACTINIUM settled three wide off of the early fractions, lost ground on the far turn, stopped in upper stretch, was eased through the
lane and walked off under his own power. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING IN DEEP STRETCH INVOLVING GROSS
PROFIT AND LIBERTY WOLF. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT LIBERTY WOLF IMPEDED GROSS PROFIT IN DEEP
STRETCH BUT AS A RESULT OF GROSS PROFIT FINISHING AHEAD OF LIBERTY WOLF THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE OFFICIAL
ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
MADEIRA WINE broke alertly and dictated terms in the early going, was well rated through the backstretch run while setting a pressured pace, turned away
DERRYGOOLIN leaving the quarter marker and drew clear nearing the furlong grounds, was confronted in deep stretch by the runner-up and gamely held
on to prevail. DERRYGOOLIN showed early speed and prompted the reasonable fractions through the backstretch run, kept close attendance to the
pacesetter through the second turn, lost ground to MADEIRA WINE approaching the furlong marker, re-rallied in deep stretch, closed well in the late stages
and just missed for the win, while besting the rest. STOIC LUNA stalked the early pace from the inside, lost ground nearing the quarter marker, chased to
mid-stretch, gained ground in the final sixteenth, was outfinished in deep stretch and just held for show. REV REE was allowed to settle, raced two wide
through the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, gained ground in the final sixteenth, was outkicked in the late stages and just missed for show. I'LL DO
IT FOR YOU stalked the reasonable early fractions from a three wide path, gained ground along the backstretch run, lost position three wide on the far turn
and gave way. MISTY CAT was a bit slow into early stride, lagged through the backstretch run and was not involved in the late stages.

CROSBY BEACH was forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the solid fractions through the backstretch run, gained ground three wide nearing the
quarter marker, vied for the lead nearing mid-stretch, could not keep pace with BIG FLAME in the final furlong and just held for place in the final strides.
VANTAGE POINT pressed the solid early fractions, kept attendance to SACRED RIDER through the second turn, vied for the lead with CROSBY BEACH to
mid-stretch, could not go on with the winner in deep stretch and just missed for place, while well clear of the rest for show. GOVENOR'S PARTY stalked the
early fractions while three wide, maintained position through the backstretch run, came four wide into the drive, ran evenly to the furlong marker and lacked
a final kick. SACRED RIDER broke alertly and was sent to establish the early lead, set a pressured pace through the backstretch run, was pressed to the
quarter marker while carving solid fractions, could not hold off oncoming rivals in upper stretch and faded. BARHOPSKY was unhurried, raced two wide

Footnotes
EMMA'S DANCE broke alertly, ceded the early lead and tracked the pacesetter through the turn, overtook DANCING CRANE in upper stretch, held the
runner-up at bay inside of the furlong marker and just lasted in the final strides to prevail. PERSUASIVE LIPS stalked the early pace, gained ground three
wide nearing the quarter marker, swung four wide leaving the turn, closed the gap on EMMA'S DANCE in deep stretch, just missed for the win in the final
strides and was second best. DO YOU HEAR THAT tracked the solid early fractions, gained ground two wide on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was
outkicked in the final sixteenth and just held for show. ROSE PRINCESS chased from the second flight, came four wide on the turn, swung five wide into the
drive, could not make headway in deep stretch and just missed for show. CROWN KITTEN was hard to load, threw her head at the start and crowded YES
PLEASE leaving the break, chased two wide through the turn and offered a mild late rally. DANIELA BELLA hopped at the start then was shuffled leaving
the break, chased from the rear, improved position four wide on the turn, came five wide into the drive and finished evenly in the final stages. YES PLEASE
crowded at the start and off a step slowly, chased from the rail and was not a threat. DANCING CRANE had good early speed, set solid fractions through
the turn, was overtaken by EMMA'S DANCE leaving the bend, chased that one to mid-stretch and gave way. SEN SEN chased the pace to the turn, lost
ground three wide nearing the quarter marker, trailed into the stretch run and was not a factor.
