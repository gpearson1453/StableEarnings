Footnotes
COBRA JET was away in good order then drifted out early, set a pressured pace from off the rail, responded when challenged by YOU SPLIT ENDS
nearing the quarter and SHIP IT RED with a furlong to run and edged away late. EXXEL checked soon after the start, raced reserved just off the leaders
early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. SHIP IT RED was never far back while racing along the inside, remained inside
for the drive, offered a bid in mid-stretch but failed to sustain his rally. RONAMO checked soon after the start, showed no early speed, raced five-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. YOU SPLIT TENS pressed the pace of the winner while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter
and gave way in the drive. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AND INQUIRY AND THE RIDERS OF EXXEL AND RONAMO BOTH LODGED OBJECTIONS
AGAINST COBRA JET CONCERNING THE DRIFTING OUT OF THAT FOE AND CAUSING BOTH TO CHECK AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS
THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED COBRA JET FROM FIRST AND PLACED HIM FOURTH.

chased the winner while racing six-wide, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole, was no match for the winner and gave way late for the place.

Footnotes
HEART ON THE RUN was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside with SOLA, disposed of that rival into the lane and held sway to the wire.
BIG AL'S PRINCESS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. PAYNT THE KITTY settled
off the leaders early, moved eighth-wide through the turn and finished with good energy. PARTY POLICE was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide
through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. YOUONLYLIVETWICE was checked at the start, lagged early, moved five-wide through the turn and found
her best stride late. SOLA disputed the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and weakened after the opening quarter. CLARE CRESCENT raced off
the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. OLD WEST was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through
the turn and was not a factor. PAGODA RIDGE lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not menace.

drew off. OUR VALLEY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. DOUBLE THE GOLD
lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with a late bid. LINCHTOWN broke sharply to dispute the pace
with the winner from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. ROMEO'S GLORY settled off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn and
finished evenly in the drive. HIGH FLYIN TIGER lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. JUST PICK IT UP chased the
leaders while racing four-wide and gave way after going a half. FISHIN THE RIVER was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and failed to
menace. W. WHITEHOUSE lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
PAINT ME LUCKY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, responded when set down for the drive and wore down
FULL DRAW in the closing yards. FULL DRAW stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the half, opened a clear margin
into the lane, drifted out in mid-stretch and yielded to the winner late. FINAL FINAL raced five-wide through the first turn, chased the leaders while racing
four-wide, checked in mid-stretch and gave way. MILORDS OATHKEEPER chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way after going
three-quarters. TELLER settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. CHECK AND RAISE was void of early
speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and failed to menace. EARNEST raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn
and lacked the needed rally. INCLUDE HOO lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn and did not offer a bid. RUN TAPPY was void of early
speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. LINEMANS CHECK lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn and
did not menace. WESTFEST raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the second turn and weakened. STONUS MAXIMUS sprinted clear at
once, saved ground while setting the pace and weakened after going three-quarters. THE RIDER OF FINAL FINAL LODGED AND OBJECTION AGAINST
FULL DRAW CONCERNING STEADYING HIS MOUNT IN MID-STRETCH AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
RIVER ROSE tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the three-eighths pole, offered a bid nearing the quarter, opened a clear margin with a
furlong to run and held off the closing VINTAGE KJITTEN to prevail. VINTAGE KITTEN was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the
second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with good late energy. MY BOY LOLLIPOP was void of early speed, saved ground through the second
turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with a late bid. EROTIC chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive.
OUR DANDY'S BOY set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way gradually. MONUMENTAL SEVEN pressed the pace from between foes, moved
up to offer a bid nearing the half, opened a clear margin and gave way after going three-quarters. WILLTOBELUCKY settled off the leaders from the inside
and gradually weakened. EXCALIBUR RIDGE lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. ALPINE HYPNOSIS was
void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. BLUE AZUL raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through
the second turn and weakened.
