Footnotes
IOANNA pressed the pace and made a two wide bid on the turn and was clear by the quarter pole, then drew off leaving the turn and was ridden out to
prove much the best. SIRENETTA broke outwardly at the start, then raced wide on the turn and came widest into the lane and rallied well to gain the place
award, no match to the winner. FANCY WARRIOR was settled early and was three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and had some late gain to
just miss the place award. MIDNIGHT REVENGE set a pressured pace on the inside and then was empty in the drive. QUICK LORI B chased the pace and
was on the inside to the two path on the turn and weakened. LUCKY STROKE was off slowly and had no response on the inside.

SUGAR SMILE was settled early, advanced two wide on the turn, then dropped to the inside leaving the quarter pole and made a inside move leaving the
turn and got thru on the rail leaving the furlong marker and edged clear to prove best under a drive. JACK'S LILLY stalked the early pace and made a three
wide bid on the turn and ran on to the wire but was outfinished. SPUNKY ZOEY stumbled slightly at the start, rushed up the inside to vie for command, then
shook clear on the turn and came two wide into the lane and faded the final furlong, held show award. DOWSER was settled early and made a four wide
move on the turn to loom boldly by the quarter pole but flattened out, missed show award. FREEDOM CHEER was well placed on the inside and then was
roused by the quarter pole and angled out leaving the three sixteenths pole but lacked a bid. BE LIKE BETH vied for the lead two wide and weakened.

Footnotes
SUPER DUPER FLY used her inside position to set the early pace while in the two path, was well handled and drew clear on the far turn, then was kept to
right handed crop pressure to remain clear and prove best for a pumped up rider. DETERMINED EMPIRE was allowed to settle early on the inside,
advanced three to four wide on the turn and swung out six wide leaving the turn and finished well. SEEKINGARRANGEMENT chased the early pace
between rivals, then was three wide on the turn and came four wide into the lane and had no kick, held show award. DALLAS was settled back early,
advanced flour wide on the turn and swung out seven wide leaving the turn and had a belated rally. LET'S GO MO chased the pace on the inside and
weakened. DUST BUNNY chased the pace three to four wide and weakened. HIGH CLASS DIVA prompted pace three wide and tired.
