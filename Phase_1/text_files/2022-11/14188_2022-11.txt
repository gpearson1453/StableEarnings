Footnotes
JARDANI , well back after breaking in the air, pulled his way forward on the backstretch, advanced four deep entering the far turn, bid for the lead outside
RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY in upper stretch, dueled with that one and determinedly prevailed. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY set the pace along the inner rail, dueled
through the stretch and just missed in a game effort. GHOSTLIGHTER , three wide both turns, chased the pace to the stretch and failed to rally. ORO DE
MORO MORO , three wide the first turn, prompted the pace to upper stretch and gave way. JONNY QUIST bobbled leaving the starting gate and dropped
back leaving the backstretch.

Footnotes
MOSE PERFECT bobbled at the break, recovered and edged up four wide to be within range of a contested pace, was put to a hustling ride near the half,
advanced four wide and engaged the leaders from the outside with a quarter to go, emerged in a battle outside BATON for the final furlong, gained a slim
lead nearing the sixteenth pole and held firm under steady handling. BATON vied two wide outside LATE NIGHT LARRY, gained a short lead into the lane,
fought on between runners past the three sixteenths, kept on to the inside of the winner through the final eighth and just wasn't quite good enough in a
sharp effort. AWESOME MAN broke a step slow, edged up in hand and between foes near the five eighths, dropped in a bit and tracked, waited briefly near
the five sixteenths, shifted out some then went evenly after having aim in mid stretch. LATE NIGHT LARRY took a short lead into the first turn, sparred to
the inside of BATON, ceded command near the quarter pole, stayed on to battle inside a pair of foes to mid stretch then faded. UNDER THE RADAR , in a
bit close at the break, raced well back early on, swung wide for the drive and had belated action. BODE LYNX , in the clear while settled early, was urged off
the making a mild move past the three eighths, remained in touch to upper stretch then faded. FEDERAL OFFENSE , unruly pre race, stalked three wide,
raced between runners past the three eighths and weakened. WONDER WATER saved ground while not too far back past the five eighths, dropped back
under urging near the three eighths, swung out and came up empty.

COVER THE SPREAD , unruly in the starting gate, stalked the pace in the two path around the turn, swung five deep in upper stretch, swept to command
approaching the eighth pole and drew out under steady handling. DIAMOND SUE showed speed inside horses, saved ground around the turn, dueled to
mid stretch and faded the final furlong. TITIAN TYRANT circled foes around the turn, had a four wide bid for the lead in upper stretch and weakened late.
GOLD DIGGING BROAD , along the inner rail around the turn, angled out near the eighth pole and offered a mild move. BIG AMBITION prompted the pace
outside DIAMND SUE and faltered in the drive. ANATH gave way on the turn and was eased.

Footnotes
STAY OUT , bumped at the break, was nudged up to the inside of a rival and took command leaving the five eighths, set a rated pace while clear around the
turn, was guided two to three wide soon into the lane, responded when roused right handed and opened up under a steady drive. DANCER'S MELODY ,
bumped at the break, showed speed and attended the pace outside the winner, failed to kick on with that one entering the lane but stayed on gamely to
save the place. DEVILISH AFFAIR broke slowly, was angled wide early, edged up four wide leaving the far turn, chased the winner from the quarter pole,
kept on with effort but was out kicked for the place. DULCE KIARA saved ground with aim and faded. LUCKBEALADYTONIGHT , three wide with pursuit,
faded. FORTES , off the pace, dropped in to about the two path nearing the turn but lacked a rally. THUNDERTURTLE came out at the break and bumped
the winner, saved ground and came up empty. EIFS , away alertly despite a stumble, raced close up between foes early, failed to kick on past the five
sixteenths, shifted out and gave way.

Footnotes
TATE , rated inside horses down the backstretch, moved outside on the far turn, advanced four deep leaving the turn, took command in upper stretch, was
under brisk urging in mid stretch and pulled away. AUSPICIOUS LAD bore out leaving the starting gate, sprinted to a four wide lead on the first turn, moved
to the inner rail on the backstretch, lost the lead in upper stretch and held the place. MYSTIFIED offered a three wide move leaving the far turn then
weakened in the drive. PURSUING PACE , no factor, passed tired horses. SPRITZER chased the pace, raced in the two path on the far turn and weakened.
ICY MINISTER , four wide on both turns, was not a factor. BOFFO KID , along the inner rail most of the trip, steadily retreated the final three furlongs. CASH
KID , four wide the first turn, was not a factor. ORO GRIS , four deep entering the far turn, faltered. HORNBEAM , forced out leaving the starting gate,
trailed.

VILLAREGGIA , in range of a contested pace while saving ground, angled out under asking past the five sixteenths, circled five wide into the lane, closed in
and drew alongside the leader with a furlong to go, wrested command soon after and drew out on her left lead while ridden out. THAT'S SOME KISS ,
perched three wide off the dueling leaders, moved to bid three deep in hand mid turn, took the lead into the lane, was roused clear past the three sixteenths,
met the challenge from the winner soon after, faded and lasted for second. TOSS A COIN saved ground under some rating, eased out three wide into the
lane and churned on with interest. HELLUVA LADY vied two wide outside a rival, held a slim lead between foes mid turn, battled into the lane then gave way
through the final furlong. PRAY FOR THE U S A broke slowly, hustled up soon after and contested the pace, battled inside into and around the turn then
gave way in mid stretch. DOTADA lagged off the pace, circled the turn four wide and lacked a bid. JOHNNYSLITTLEGIRL , three wide with pursuit,
weakened. DIVA READY , off the pace, faltered around the turn and was eased late.

SEICHE stalked the pace down the backstretch, bid for the lead outside horses mid way on the far turn and drew off under urging. WALK AWAY JOE , sent
to the early lead, raced along the inner rail, failed to get pace on the far turn, swung outside in upper stretch and passed a tired rival.
FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY gained a two wide lead mid way down the backstretch, lost the lead turning for home and gave way the final furlong. IRISH
MEADOW , up close down the backstretch, was three wide leaving the far turn and gave way. WELLING raced along the inner rail most of the trip and
trailed.

Footnotes
PLOT THE DOTS rated forwardly then eased out near the five eighths to be three wide and track the dueling leaders, bid three deep around the far turn,
dueled on a slim lead outside ZABRACADABRA from the five sixteenths, exchanged a bump with that one leaving the three sixteenths, kept on under right
handed asking and edged clear in the final yards. ZABRACADABRA vied outside a rival, raced between runners leaving the far turn, inherited the rail near
the three eighths and emerged in a battle with the winner, carried that scrum into the lane, exchanged a bump past the three sixteenths, fought on valiantly
but wasn't quite good enough in the final seventy yards. VANCE SCHOLARS , off the pace while saving ground, was under pressure around the final turn,
eased out for the drive, split rivals in mid stretch and kept on willingly. BENANDJOE set a pressured pace inside, dueled past the five eighths, failed to kick
on with the leaders leaving the three eighths, held willingly to the sixteenth pole then faded. EXCELLORATOR saved ground, angled out leaving the far turn
but lacked a solid run. THE POSER lost ground four wide around the first turn, remained off the rail and lacked a response. TREASURE TROVE lagged
back while well wide and failed to menace. HIGHWAY BOUND stumbled badly, regrouped and pulled his way between foes to reach a stalking spot into the
backstretch, chased outside a rival past the five eighths, faltered and was eased when distanced.
