AUNTIE BEV broke out and away well, cleared and stayed clear on the backstretch and thru the turn, entered final sixteenth still clear and lasted to the wire.
SAI PHAR chased leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, took aim in the three path in the lane and gained to the wire under
strong urging. SISKIYOU SKY away cleanly, settled into a stalking position on the backstretch, entered turn off the rail, made advancements two wide on
the turn, and made mild progress in the four path down the lane. LORRHA chased clear leader along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the
inside on the turn and lacked response in the lane. MAMALONA away cleanly, lugged out three lanes early, stalked pace well off the rail on the backstretch,
entered turn in the three path and came up empty in the lane.
