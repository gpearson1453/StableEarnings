Footnotes
LIVING IN PARADISE tracked in the three path, was roused through an opening along the inside around the turn, took the lead and opened up into the
lane, and kicked clear. CLOUD STORAGE stalked from the two path, shifted out to take aim from the five path into the stretch, and ran on for place. WOLF
RAYET steadied after the start, trailed from the four path, saved ground and cut the corner going into the lane, and rallied for show. ARTIFACT (GB) had a
slight steady early, rated from inside, was in tight between rivals at the top of the lane, and was one paced. BULLOCK dueled from inside, drifted out to the
four path into the stretch, and faded. LUVISANAKI chased in the five path but was never a factor. GI GI'S GOLDEN GAL dueled while two wide, floated out
to the five path into the lane, but gaveway. VIMISOFA dueled from four path early but yielded while drifting out to the ten path around the turn.

Footnotes
VAI VIA stalked the pace three wide, bid three wide between foes nearing the far turn, took a narrow lead entering the turn, vied inside of IRONY around the
turn and through upper stretch then drew clear. IRONY settled off the early pace while racing three wide, bid four wide into the far turn, pressed the winner
around the bend but was no match for the that foe in the lane. HARLAN'S LEGACY raced off the pace two and three wide, continued on the left lead in the
lane and was along for the show. WHEELINGNDEALING prompted the pace two wide, bid between foes nearing the three-eighths marker, chased two wide
around the far turn and faded in the lane. LITTLELADYISAWOMAN was outrun inside. FUNTASTICA raced off the pace three wide, advanced outside down
the backstretch, steadied entering the far turn, raced four wide around that bend and lacked a response. LOST LUGGAGE set the pace along the rail and
was through after a half. PER RULING FROM THE FLORIDA RACING COMMISSION, IRONY WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

T VILLE led from the two path, was roused when headed turning into the lane, rebroke in the final furlong, and held gamely. NO MAN LEFT BEHIND
prompted the pace from the three path, bid from the four path going into the stretch, and ran on but hung late to place. MY MAN FLINT was caught in the six
path around the first turn, chased in the three path, took aim from the five path turning into the lane, and kept on for show. POETIC CODE was out in the
four path around the first turn, tracked from the two path down the backstretch, was driven from the four path into the lane, but was one paced.
CANYOUHEARMENOW stalked from the two path but faded going into the stretch. DUNNIGAN was caught in the five path around the first turn and was
always behind.

Footnotes
NO NANNETTE NO bumped with RUBYSA soon after the start, trailed in the two path early, advanced three wide around the far turn, shifted five wide in
upper stretch, closed outside and was up in deep stretch. RUBYSA bumped with the winner soon after the start, raced in range three wide, advanced three
wide around the far turn, took the lead leaving the eighth pole and led until deep stretch. SWEET ACTRESS saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper
stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and rallied between foes. BEAUTIFUL STAR pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the quarter pole,
led to midstretch and weakened. KARENVILLE set a pressured pace inside and tired in the lane. KENTUCKY PRIDE stalked the pace three wide and came
up empty nearing the lane. PERFECT KIMBERLY S played no factor while racing three and four wide.

ridden in the four path going into the stretch, and kept on but yielded late to show. FISHING FOR FUN stalked from inside, shifted out to the six path into the

Footnotes
HEAVENS EXPRESS settled off the pace while racing three wide, circled five wide around the far turn, took the lead near the sixteenth pole, dueled outside
of a stubborn STUCK IN MALIBU and prevailed. STUCK IN MALIBU pressed the pace three wide, took over near the quarter pole, was collared by the
winner near the sixteenth pole, fought on gamely inside and just missed. EVIE DOES IT tracked the pace two wide, bid between foes in upper stretch,
bumped with FATIMA SUNSHINE near the eighth pole and was outkicked from there. MISS NEW YORK was bumped soon after the start, raced in range
inside and was one-paced through the final furlong. WAND saved ground and failed to menace. MO TOWN MADISON never threatened while racing three
and four wide. FATIMA SUNSHINE tracked the pace four wide, bid in upper stretch, bumped near the eighth pole and lacked any further bids. CHRISTINA
ANN was outrun inside. STARSHIP SIGRUN was bumped soon after the start, trailed inside early, went four wide around the far turn and never factored.
ACTION ROSE set the pace along the rail and retreated through the lane.

wide, was driven from the six path into the lane, and ran on for place. TAKECAREOFBUSINESS chased from six wide early, shifted in to the three path
around the turn, and kept on for show. ROCKIN ROLLER pressed three wide, was ridden from the five path into the stretch, but finished evenly. EXTENDO

Footnotes
MISS YOU ELLA stalked the pace inside, tipped out in upper stretch, closed determinedly and was up in deep stretch. OMIXOCHITL pressed the pace two
wide, dueled inside of a foe in the two path around the far turn, shook clear in upper stretch and led until the final strides. JUMEIRAH raced in range two and
three wide and ran on for the show. HA' PENNY prompted the pace three wide, dueled outside a foe in the three path around the turn, could not match
strides in upper stretch but churned on for a minor share. SIEMPRE ELEGANTE failed to menace while racing two and three wide. TAMARINDO settled off
the pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far but faded through the lane. MISS MATTIE B trailed in the two path around the first turn,
went five wide around the far turn and never threatened. LOVE HER LOTS was bumped at the start, raced three and four wide and made little impact.
FRIPPET set the pace along the rail and faltered around the far turn.

Footnotes
AVOW was held up from the four path early, was cued to bid three wide around the turn, took over into the stretch and went clear. TWIRLING GRACE set
the pace inside, was driven from the two path going into the lane, and held on for place. KAEKO pressed in the three path, shifted out to the five path going
into the stretch, and kept on for show. OUR FANTASY rated from inside, swung out to the six path going into the lane, but finished evenly. MILES OF
SMILES stalked from the two path, floated out to the eight path into the stretch, but flattened. LET'S BE HONEST tracked in the five path but was never a
threat. BION MAGIC trailed throughout from the six path.

Footnotes
EXPRESS PHAROAH tracked the pacesetter in the clear in the three path, cruised up to the lead nearing the five-sixteenths, quickly cleared and held safe
under a drive. SILENT CHAOS raced off the pace four wide and finished willingly. THORN raced in range three wide, bid three wide nearing the
five-sixteenths, could not match strides in upper stretch and lasted for the show. BYE BYE DAVID raced off the pace two and three wide, fanned five wide in
upper stretch and had a mild stretch gain. ASTROTURF lacked early speed while racing two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and lacked the
needed rally. GOLDEN INDY chased the pace inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole and faded in the lane. BIRDNOTE was outrun inside. MAYOR
REMO set a clear pace in the two path and faltered nearing the quarter pole.
