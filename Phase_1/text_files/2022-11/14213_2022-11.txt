Footnotes
EYESEEMONEY lagged behind the field early on despite rider encouragement, cut the gap entering the lane, shifted out to the center of the track in upper
stretch, and rallied outside of rivals to drive past the leaders in the final sixteenth. BET ON BOURBON stalked outside of the top pair, loomed a danger while
bidding turning for home, drew clear entering the lane, but failed to open up in upper stretch, held sway from chasing foes through midstretch, but was worn
down in the closing stages. FORT PIKE vied for the lead two wide, then from between horses around the turn, but was outkicked by his outer counterpart
nearing the lane, shifted out and sustained a chase through midstretch, got outkicked by another outer oncharging foe in the final furlong while attempting a
bid for place, but was fended off for that position. MRS. DELLA set a pressured pace along the inside, sparred with a pair of outer foes around the turn
before being headed at the five sixteenths pole, then fought on through upper stretch, but weakened through the final furlong.

Footnotes
OLDER AND WISER steadied while shying from an inner troubled foe soon after the start, climbed while off of the pace in the four path around the first turn,
gained and shifted to the rail to achieve position behind the leaders at the seven sixteenths pole, but checked behind foes into the far turn, faltered to
midpack before shifting out to the four path leaving the five sixteenths pole, loomed a danger outside of the top two turning for home, bid entering the lane,
drove clear in midstretch, and was put to wraps in the final sixteenth. HARD KINGS broke on top before shifting out and bumping with an outer rival soon
after the start, relegated to midpack along the inside around the first turn, failed to sustain position down the backstretch, yet regained stride turning for
home, shifted out through the lane, and stayed on to reach place late. RONALDS GATSBY tracked two wide, gained four wide approaching the far turn, bid
in the three path outside of the pace setter around the far turn, led with a quarter mile to go, but offered little resistance to an outer bidder entering the lane,
vied for place with the early pace setter through midstretch, but was bested by an different outer foe for that position late. WILD T RANGER bumped with an
inner rival soon after the start, shied outwardly in the aftermath, yet recovered to set the pace into the first turn, showed the way in the two path before being
headed by an outer rival at the quarter pole, vied for place with that rival after a different foe took charge entering the lane, but yielded in the final sixteenth.
DEMON HUNTER pressed two wide, but faltered between horses entering the far turn, and weakened. STONE ALLIANCE broke out, lacked speed while
hung in the five path, and made little impact. THUNDER JAM broke a step slow, lagged behind around both turns, then cut the gap on the rest of the group
late. THEOS FLEW stalked three wide, pursued from between horses into the far turn, but was outmoved around that bend, and weakened.

Footnotes
YOUNG TUSCAN quickly sped clear early on, showed the way in hand from the three path around the turn, kicked away from inching rival entering the lane,
and managed a wide advantage while hanging on her left lead through the final furlong. LILRASCALMAN tracked three wide while in the five path around
the turn, inched closer entering the lane to claim place and take aim on the clear leader, but failed to keep pace with that one while also hanging on his left
lead through the lane, and pulled clear of the rest. GYPSY'S SOULMATE chased the clear leader from the four path, but lost place to an outer rival entering
the lane, gave way thereafter, yet held show. MY HEAVY SON trailed along the inside, and improved in the final furlong. ITELLYOUTHEFACTS stalked
along the inside while a it off of the rail , shifted outwardly while chasing in upper stretch, and lacked a bid between horses. HEREWECOMETOGETYOU
lacked speed in the four path, floated to the seven path in upper stretch, and made little impact.

Footnotes
EMERALD FOREST prompted the pace two wide, sparred in the three path into the turn before forging an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, then drove
clear while shifting ground outwardly in upper stretch, and held sway from inner chasers through the late stages. COLTONATOR tracked in the three to four
paths, tipped inside of the clear and drifting leader in upper stretch, bumped an inner foe while bidding for place in the process, then vied with that rival for
that position through midstretch, disposed of that foe while hoping to attempt a bid inside of the leader in the late stages, but did not have enough. YANKEE
SEVEN stalked along the inside, awaited racing room behind the top pair leaving the quarter pole, split those foes in upper stretch, took a bump from an
outer COLTONATOR while vying for place at the three sixteenths pole, and yielded in deep stretch. CALL ME MIDNIGHT laid unhurried in the three path,
shifted outside of the main group in upper stretch, but lacked a bid. SIGN OF WAR set the pace in the two path, dueled for the lead inside of the eventual
winner around the turn, but weakened in upper stretch. BURNINHUNKOFLOVE showed little.

Footnotes
PLAY MO pressed two wide, led approaching the half mile pole, showed the way in the two path as an outer MARTINIZED pressed, got headed by that foe
in upper stretch, yet sustained the duel through the final furlong, re-forged an advantage in the final sixteenth, and prevailed. MARTINIZED took a brush to
his hind quarters from an inner rival soon after the start, tracked two to three wide, moved to press the leader from the three path around the far turn, bid
turning for home, wrestled an advantage in upper stretch, but failed to kick on, sparred with his inner counterpart through midstretch, but relinquished the
lead in the final sixteenth. GUITARTUITION PLZZ was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe while off half a beat slow at the start, laid off of the pace
four wide, moved forward to claim show into the far turn, then chased the top pair from the four path around thereafter, and was best of the rest. SCORING
DRIVE stalked along the inside, but was shuffled back behind a tiring foe entering the far turn, shifted three wide at the three furlong pole, and moved up
turning for home. FOOLISH DREAMS lunged out and bumped a foe at the start, got keen among foes entering the first turn before racing rank behind rivals
in the around that bend, continued to tug in the bit before improving between horses entering the far turn, but came up empty entering the lane. MR. TIN
MAN set the pace, but was headed with a half mile to go, and weakened around the far turn.

RICKY BOBBY laid off of the pace in the four path, tracked in hand down the backstretch, intently pursued outside of the top pair into the far turn, ranged up
to bid at the quarter pole, inched clear entering the lane, shifted in slightly and across MAGAZIE STREET's path in upper stretch while hanging on his left
lead, then changed over leaving the furlong pole, and continued to kick away. MAGAZINE STREET stalked two wide and from the three path, prompted the
pace from between horses while under strong urging around the far turn, failed to keep pace with his outer counterpart nearing the lane, chased that
clearing foe straightening for home, but shied when that rival shifted across his path in upper stretch, then vied for place between horses entering the final
furlong, and held. LEROY JENKINS tracked in the three to two paths, shifted to the four path entering the lane, shied five wide from an inner troubled rival in
upper stretch, stayed on to bid for place soon after, but was fended off through the closing stages. STOCKPILER checked behind rivals early on, settled far
back in the two path, shifted to the four path around the far turn, then tipped to the six path inside the final furlong, and moved up. DIALED A DAME stalked
along the inside, slipped through to bid for place in upper stretch, but yielded in the final furlong. IRONMAN RICHIE broke outwardly, set the pace in the two
path, showed the way from a pair of outer pressers around the far turn, but was headed at the quarter pole, and weakened between horses approaching
midstretch. MO VODKA was put to crowded quarters by an inner foe in the early stages, raced off of the pace while hooked in the five path, and failed to
factor. OGRE'S LION KING laid off of the pace in the two path, then trailed while drifting out to the eight path around the far turn, and was outrun. THE
RIDER OF MAGAZINE STREET CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF RICKY BOBBY FOR INTERFENCE IN UPPER STRETCH; THE OBJECTION
WAS UPHELD BY THE STEWARDS; RICKY BOBBY WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND.

bidder nearing the lane, sparred for place with his inner counterpart through midstretch, and prevailed. SAILING SOLO set the pace inside of a prompting
rival, vied with that foe into the far turn, but proved no match for a wider bidder turning for home, vied for place through midstretch, but yielded late.

Footnotes
TRICK QUESTION set the pace along the inside, responded readily when set down entering the lane, shook free from a pursuing MY AUNT SNOOKIE in
upper stretch, and continued to inch away through the final furlong. MY AUNT SNOOKIE broke a step slowly, stalked along the inside, took aim outside of
the leader entering the lane, but only managed to chase that foe while proving second best. SWEET CHABLIS laid off of the pace in the three to two paths
around the turn, gained show from outer rivals leaving the quarter pole, ran on while chasing the top pair, and staved off an inner rival for show late.
VIVACIOUSLY was outsprinted by the rest of the group and lagged behind early on, saved ground while picking up stride turning for home, then stayed on
well along the rail through the lane, but failed to reach show. MO LOVIN chased two wide and from between horses, but failed to sustain position at the half
mile pole, and steadily gave way around the turn. TEASE ME NOT hopped at the start while off of slow, laid off of the pace in the three path, ranged closer
in the four path turning for home, but flattened out in upper stretch. BANK ON IT stalked three to two wide, but weakened in the three path between horses
passing the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
SHESABEAUTYDANCER set the pace in the two path, showed the way from a prompting rival around the turn, dueled while clinging to a margin in upper
stretch, flopped back to her left lead entering the final furlong, and prevailed over her drifting counterpart. HONEYSUCKLEDELIGHT stalked in the three
path, pressed the leader around the turn, dueled while hanging on her left lead through the lane, but lugged out multiple paths in the final sixteenth, and
missed while saving place. CLASSICAL MAGNOLIA stalked in the three path, shifted to the five path while entering the lane, chased the embattled leading
pair through midstretch, inched closer in the final furlong, but had to alter course to remain outside of a lugging rival in the final sixteenth, and missed
reaching that rival for place. THE CALLING STONE laid off of the pace along the inside, inched closer in the four path around the turn before floating to the
six path entering the lane, and chased evenly. MRS. NECAISE tracked along the inside, but faded. LEAD ME raced far back three wide and never got
involved. AFLEET CHARLENE raced towards the rear two wide, and was outrun.
