MY GOLD MIRROR cleared early, continued on a clear lead through the turn, widened into the lane and then continued to extend to the wire while being
urged intermittently. BAYOU SHACK chased the pace from along the inside through the turn, bid into the lane from the three path into the lane and was
clear for the place spot while no threat to the winner. ILLUSIONED was never a threat while in the three path through the turn and into the lane. LONGER
VIEW never a factor while in the three path through the turn and into the lane. WHEN IN ROME chased the pace while along the inside through the turn and
faded entering the lane. TRUST FUND ROBBER trailed throughout while in the two path.

Footnotes
V. E. TIA clear pace from the two path, continued clear into the lane, was urged right-handed twice near the eighth pole then drew away through the final
eighth. LUSH BE A LADY stalked the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane from the three path when closest then could not gain
through the final eighth while saving the place spot. CHELSEA'S STRENGTH chased the winner from the inside through the turn and into the lane then
could not gain while just missing the place spot. TIZ ABBY raced off the inside in the four or three path through the turns and weakened through the lane.
MAKE OVER never a factor while saving ground. SWIFT TEMPLE raced in the two or three path through the turns and lacked a response.

TAP THE LINE pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch, cleared into the turn, was joined by another in mid-turn, dueled from the three-sixteenths
to the wire while two wide and just prevailed. ZIPSY ROSE LEE chased the pace along the inside into the turn, continued along the rail while putting
pressure on the leader, cut the corner into the lane, was on near even terms from the three-sixteenths pole to the wire and was denied and settled for
second best. EMERSON'S DREAM vied for the lead along the inside down the backstretch, could not keep up into the turn then was no threat to the top two
while finishing best of the rest. BEYOND JUSTICE was never a threat while along the inside. SEQUEEKER raced in the four path through the turn when no
far back then tired into the lane. GET STORM AWAY pressed the pace three wide down the backstretch then was done entering the far turn.

Footnotes
DIAMOND SOLITAIRE trailed early, raced off the inside down the backstretch, bid five wide through the turn when gaining momentum, swung into the lane
a serious menace, gained a short lead nearing the eighth pole while in the five path, edged up and held to the wire. MINTCHOCOLATECHIP raced in the
three path through the turns while never far back, angled into the two path into the lane and quickly became a serious threat, dueled with the winner through
the final eighth and could not get past while clearly second best. NATIVE LION stalked the pace from the three path down the backstretch, bid into the turn
to gain the lead, continued with the lead into late turn then could not keep up with the top two while just lasting for the show spot. BUOY chased the pace
from the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five, lacked a closing bid and just missed the show spot. AMAZING GAL pressed the pace
two wide down the backstretch, gained a short lead approaching the far turn then gave way before mid-turn. ELUSIVE JUSTICE raced in the four path into
the far turn and never was a factor. ANNA'S TRIBUTE vied for the lead along the inside into the backstretch, continued to chase the pace into the far turn
and was suddenly done. QUICK AND EASY steadily faded while near the inside.

Footnotes
ANGEL OF EMPIRE was unhurried while in the two path, advanced closer on the turn while in near the inside, continued with good momentum into the
lane, was floated out by the winner and into the five path, dueled with that one briefly then drew away. MCMONEY was in the three to the two path through
the turn when near the back, stayed along the inside through the lane and found good energy to be clear for the place spot. AIRTIME chased the pace while
along the inside down the backstretch, got though after the half-mile pole to gain the lead into the turn, continued on the front-end through the lane, cleared
after mid-turn, came into the lane from the four path, dueled with the winner to outside the eighth pole then could not keep up. CORONA GRANDE set the
pace while in the two path into the far turn, was passed on the inside then weakened in the lane. PHANTOM RIDE raced in the four path through the far turn
and tired. TIZ A BEAST pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch, gained a short lead halfway through the race, chased the pace into the lane then
faded. CALIFORNIA TWIRL was in the three into the far turn when never far back then was done nearing the quarter pole. PLAIN OR PEANUT was
steadied into the first turn when in tight, raced in the back throughout while saving ground. A STEWARD'S INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN
RESULTED IN NO ACTION BEING TAKEN.
