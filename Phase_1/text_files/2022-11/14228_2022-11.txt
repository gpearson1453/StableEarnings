Footnotes
SHELL SHOCK was allowed to settle in stride while saving ground, angled out three-wide nearing the quarter pole, took the lead approaching the eighth
pole, quickly drew clear and was taken in hand late. SASSY SAGEY set the pressured pace racing along the outside of Afleet Arlene, responded when
headed by the winner, was not match for the one but held on well for the place. SOCIAL MANDATE brushed with Mrs. Nushi at the start, then moved up
four-wide to be prominently place in the opening stages, dropped back slightly on the turn, then came five-wide into the stretch and finished willingly.
AFLEET ARLENE vied for the lead from along the inside to the stretch and weakened in the late stages. MRS. NUSHI brushed with Social Mandate at the
start, then moved up to prompt the pace while racing three-wide, was four-wide entering the stretch and tired. GATHER IN BALI dropped back early and
trailed throughout.

of Wonder to take the lead approaching the eighth pole and quickly drew clear. WORLD OF WONDER saved ground setting the early pace, drifted out
slightly nearing the quarter pole, responded when asked but could not match strides with the winner late while clearly second best. DANCE RHYTHMS was
allowed to settle in stride early, moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole and then weakened during the drive. MAGICAL PEAPOD
prompted the pace from along the outside to the stretch and tired. KIMBERLEY DREAM was forwardly placed for a half mile racing along the inside and

REAL NEWS was prominently placed from the start while racing two-wide, angled out nearing the quarter pole to come four-wide into the stretch, caught
Hemp Heaven nearing the eighth pole and bested that one in a prolonged drive. HEMP HEAVEN was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, took the
lead nearing the quarter pole, dueled from that point and just failed to last in a game try. VIOLENT GIGI was never far back, moved up five-wide nearing the
stretch and finished in a mild rally. HONORARY DEGREE steadied while in tight along the inside leaving the chute, angled out to be three-wide, offed a bid
from between horses nearing the eighth pole and then hung. JINGLE settled in the middle of the pack while racing two-wide and lacked a late response.
ROCK N JUNE BUG set the early pace racing along the inside and weakened during the drive. CALIFORNIA STREET dropped back early and failed to
threaten. WITH VERVE was close up for a half mile racing along the inside and tired.

Footnotes
HEY BOSS was bumped at the start by Father Patrick, then was unhurried early, rallied rive-wide into the stretch, brushed with Jacks Fire Balls leaving the
quarter pole and finished strongly to be up in the final sixteenth to win going away. RIGHT OF RUSH saved ground stalking the pace, angled out to come
three-wide into the stretch, was no match for the winner but continued on for the place in a good effort. FATHER PATRICK broke in to bump the winner,
then dropped back, came six-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. JACKS FIRE BALLS was reserved off the early pace, came six-wide into the stretch
brushing with the winner leaving the quarter pole and lacked a rally. MARK THE MOOSE prompted the pace to the stretch and weakened. KEEN MIND was
allowed to settle in stride, moved up three-wide to join the leaders before going a half mile, disputed the issue to the stretch and then flattened out. MONEY
PIT saved ground and failed to threaten. ASHWINS ORB saved ground setting the pace to the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
COTTON CANDY ANNIE was well placed early while racing three-wide, responded during the drive and was up in the final sixteenth. MUSTANG LADY was
unhurried while racing two-wide, split rivals during the drive and finished fast. BLUELIGHTSPECIAL saved ground tracking the early pace, dropped back on
the turn, angled out three-wide entering the stretch and was making up ground late. BLACK FOREST dueled for the lead from along the outside to deep
stretch and weakened slightly late. JUST LIKE MAGIC was prominently paced early, dropped back on the turn, eased out for the drive and passed tiring
rivals. WILLOW BEND raced in the middle of the pack, was five-wide entering the stretch and failed to threaten. EAST SHORE dropped back early, came
six-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. PEACOCK LASS vied for the lead from along the inside to the stretch and tired. BOSS LADY BAILEY saved
ground and failed to menace.

Footnotes
FLOKI'S FLIGHT saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged by Mahaamel nearing the quarter pole, dueled with that one the rest of the
way and prevailed narrowly in a prolonged drive. MAHAAMEL chased Floki's Flight early racing two-wide, moved up to engage that one nearing the quarter
pole, dueled from that point and just missed in a stiff drive. AMERICAN ICON was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, was no match for the top two
but held on fairly well for the show. EXTRAVAGATE was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch, angled in during the drive and was gaining slightly
late.. MIDNIGHT RAID dropped back early and saved ground, steadied and altered course nearing the eighth pole running up on heels and finished willingly
when clear. GROUP EIGHTEEN failed to threaten while racing three-wide. FREEZE POP saved ground while being forwardly placed for six furlongs and
tired. TOUCH CODE raced four-wide and gave way after five furlongs.

early pace, came four-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. FLASHY CHARGE settled in stride early, came five-wide into the stretch and went evenly
late. DAME JOVIALE never far back, moved up strongly along the inside nearing the turn, offered a bid nearing the quarter pole and then flattened out.

STRAVA vied with Hazel Rah for the lead from along the inside, took the lead before and a half mile and gradually drew clear. BIG BLUE LINE was allowed
to settle in stride, moved up strongly to offer his bid nearing the quarter pole, was unable to stay with the winner late but finished well for the place.
TARTUFO was unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and was going well during the drive in a steady effort. BRIEFCASE BULLY was unhurried
early, came eight-wide into the stretch and gained his best stride too late. NEPOTISM prompted the issue while racing three-wide and weakened.
RICOCHET settled in the middle of the pack, came six-wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. MAILMAN MONEY was forwardly placed racing two-wide
and tired. MOHAAFETH was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. UBER KIRK was closed up racing along the inside to
the stretch but lacked a response. HAZEL RAH set the early pace racing two-wide and gave way after six furlongs. TEXAS RED HOT dropped back early
and failed to threaten. SILK TRADE was unhurried early and failed to menace.
