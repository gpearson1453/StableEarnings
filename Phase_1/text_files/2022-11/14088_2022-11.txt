FOLLOW THE MONEY chased the pace from the three path down the backstretch, moved into the far turn from the four path, advanced in the five path in
late turn, bid into the lane from the six path as the leader floated out, dueled with that one to near the sixteenth pole and edged clear. ON THE RAYDAR
raced off to a long lead into the backstretch, continued clear through the turn while in the three path, came into the lane from the five path, dueled inside the
eighth pole to near the sixteenth then yielded and settled for second best. AMAZING JUSTICE saved ground through the turns and into the lane then lacked
a closing a bid while well clear for the show spot. BULLBRIAR raced in the four path through the first turn, raced in the three path through the far turn then
lacked a closing response. BROKEN JUSTICE was never a factor while saving ground. ONE BIG DUDE raced in the three or four path in late turn, came
into the lane from the five path and tired.

Footnotes
SAKIC raced four wide and between rivals through the turn when never far back, swung into the lane from the three path while gaining the lead then slowly
widened through the lane. EPIC THE LEGEND raced behind a wall of rivals through the turn when in the two path, got clear into the lane from the two or
three path, moved closest to the winner inside the eighth pole and could not gain thereafter while finishing second best. RUNAWAY IMAGE was in the three
path through the turn never far back, came into the lane from the four path and moved up for the minor share. CHA CHA LARRY pressed the pace two wide
into the turn, took over in mid-turn, was under pressure into the lane and weakened. BUMPY was five wide through the turn when close up, continued in the
six path into the lane and tired. TURBONATOR trailed through the turn while in the two path, angled out through the lane and passed a couple of tired ones.
GENTLEMAN LOGAN pressed the pace three wide through the turn then faded after entering the lane. LOOKING SALTY was off alertly to gain the lead at
