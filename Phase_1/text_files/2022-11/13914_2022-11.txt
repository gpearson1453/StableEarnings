Footnotes
SAINT EROS GIRL pressed two wide, vied around the turn, assumed command with five sixteenths to go, and drew off under a brisk hand ride. SWEET
BEAUTY broke a step slowly, tracked two wide and between horses, shifted to the four path and outside of the clearing leader, and stayed on to prove
second best. MONOCACY chased along the inside, paused briefly behind the tiring early pace setter approaching the lane, then sustained his chase along
the rail while securing show in the final furlong. DOMITIA LUCILLA set the pace inside of a prompting foe, but gave way to her at the five sixteenths pole,
and weakened. MY TOMMY LEE lagged behind in the four path, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and improved. BELIEVING tracked three wide,
but tired while floated to the five path entering the lane.

Footnotes
AMERICAN PURE tracked in the three path before moving out to the four path to pursue outside of the main group around the turn, took dead aim on a
newly leading NINETIES COUNTRY entering the lane, ranged up to bid approaching the furlong grounds, and drew off. NINETIES COUNTRY stalked three
wide, cleared while in hand approaching the lane, but felt AMERICAN PURE's outer menacing presence in the process, then failed to resist that rival's bid
entering the final furlong, and was second best. ARTHURIAN stalked in the two path, then chased the leading pair through the lane while hanging on his left
lead. HOMETOWN HERO broke out, trailed in the two path, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, and moved up. SPEED BOAT vied for the lead two wide
and between horses, but failed to keep pace with his outer counterpart leaving the five sixteenths pole, and faded. FUNKY MUSIC set the pace along the
inside, sparred with a pair of outer rivals around the turn, and weakened at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
FREEZING POINT prompted the pace three wide, vied approaching the turn before gaining an advantage at the three furlong pole, drew clear soon after,
then kicked away under moderate urging through the lane. GIROOVIN tracked two wide, tipped outside of the leading trio while between horses entering the
turn, claimed place while tucking three wide and failing to keep pace with the leader entering the lane, and ran on to sustain that position. WINTERS LION
set the pace inside of a pair of vying rivals, but proved no match for his widest counterpart at the three furlong pole, and held show through the lane. EIGHT
STRAIGHT stalked along the inside, but failed to sustain that position entering the turn, shifted to the four path while towards the back of the pack in upper
stretch, and stayed on between horses mildly. LET ME LOVE YOU trailed along the inside, shifted to the four path entering the lane, then moved up
between horses while floated to the five path in midstretch. ATKINS vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but proved no match for her outer rival
at the three furlong pole, and weakened. WICKED SECRET broke a bit out, laid off of the pace, shifted from the three path to the five path entering the lane,
and gave way. BOOSTER SHOT broke a step slowly before taking up from tight quarters between horses at the start, laid off of the pace, moved forward to
a five wide tracking position outside of foes entering the turn, but weakened while floating out entering the lane.

Footnotes
CONDENSATION dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, gained an advantage from his outer counterpart at the three sixteenths pole, drove
clear before flopping back to his right lead due to a right handed crack inside the furlong pole, lugged inwardly before correcting at the sixteenth marker, and
lasted to the wire. IT TAKES HEART dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes, chased those rivals turning for home, sustained stride as CONDENSATION
kicked clear at the furlong grounds, shifted course outside of that tiring rival entering the final sixteenth, produced a mild re-bid late, but did not have enough.
CUPIDS PAYDAY tracked along the inside while a bit off of the rail around the turn, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and stayed on to reach show
late. HAPPY CLOUDS prompted the pace three wide, dueled for the lead into the turn, led turning for home, but failed to kick on in upper stretch,
relinquished the advantage to his inner counterpart at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened. HIGH FASHION LADY laid off of the pace two wide and
between horses, took the turn in the three path, and made little impact. SHE'LL NEVER KNOW lacked speed in the four path and failed to factor. MISS
ADDIE LYNN trailed in the four to five paths, and offered no rally.

Footnotes
LANTERN'S CANDY stalked two wide, tipped outside of the leading pair and to the four path into the turn, inched closer to the leader turning for home, bid
entering the lane, gained an advantage in upper stretch, and drew off. VERDANDI set the pace in the two path, but was outkicked in upper stretch, and
remained clear of show. SWEET VALERIA stalked along the inside, then chased the top pair to prove best of the rest. ARNEIS tracked four wide while in
the five path around the turn, and stayed on. KNELCOCK was brushed by rivals on either side soon after the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, and
improved inside of rivals to miss reaching fourth. BIRD HUNTER also got brushed between horses early on, pressed the leader from the three path around
the turn, but was outmoved by the eventual winner turning for home, and faded. YELLOW CREEK ROAD tracked from midpack two wide, but failed to
factor. STUPENDOUS laid off of the pace in the four to three paths, and failed to menace. RED BEE steadied from tight quarters between rivals soon after
the start, lacked speed in the three path, and never got involved. DOGWOODS BECCA raced towards the rear two wide, came into the lane in the five path,
and failed to factor. START CLASS lacked speed along the inside and faded. LIL RED CLOUD shied from an outer rival passing the thirteen sixteenths pole
causing her to lose many lengths worth of position, trailed leaving the chute, and showed little.

Footnotes
NOT YET CHARLIE tracked the top pair from the four path, bid while floated to the five path entering the lane, inched clear in upper stretch, and held sway
from a chasing pursuer through the final furlong. EL FRANCO tracked in midpack three wide, shifted to the six path entering the lane to take aim outside of
a newly leading NOT YET CHARLIE in upper stretch, but only managed to chase that foe while proving second best. OVERTHOUGHT tracked along the
inside, then chased along the rail, and gained show late. KIDYOUNOT set the pace, sparred with an outer foe around the far turn, got headed turning for
home, and gave way in upper stretch. HELLORHIGHWATER tracked in midpack two wide and between horses, but failed to progress in upper stretch,
shifted out to the six path in midstretch, and lacked a bid. BARSTOW stalked two wide, vied around the far turn, led in the four path entering the lane, but
was headed in upper stretch, and weakened between horses. DECEIVER was bumped by an outer rival into an inner foe at the start, rated at the rear along
the inside, came into the lane in the four path, and moved up between horses. SMOKEY LEE bumped an inner rival and took up while put to tight quarters
by an outer rival at the start, raced at the rear two wide, took the far turn in the four path, and failed to factor. FERRYBOAT took a bump from an outer rival
at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, and failed to factor. CHASIN CHARLIE hopped while breaking slow, lacked speed three wide, and faded.

Footnotes
STREET SWAGG was antsy in the paddock, dropped his rider stepping onto the track, but was quickly remounted without running off, stalked the leader
from the outside, bid in the four path entering the lane, and assumed command under driving pressure in upper stretch. FROG TOWN was bumped by an
outer rival into an inner foe soon after the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the six path entering the lane, stayed on to claim place at the
furlong grounds, and fended off an inner foe for that position. CONSTITUTION DAY bumped an outer rival at the start before making contact with an inner
foe in the aftermath, tracked two wide and between horses, split foes four wide in upper stretch, vied for place inside of a rival while hanging on his left lead
through the final furlong, but was denied. SACRED GROUND tracked three wide, ranged up in the five path entering the lane to attempt a bid, but flattened
out. TOM'S SPIRIT bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased along the inside, but lacked a bid. DOUBLE STRIKE lacked speed in the two path, then
moved up in the four path. F T W SLAM took a bump from an outer rival soon after the start, tracked in the two path, but encountered traffic in midstretch,
and failed to recover. CREATIVE STRATEGY got loose briefly pre-race, but was gathered and remounted without much incident, then delayed the start
while reluctant to load, sped clear once the gates popped, showed the way in the two path, but was headed while shifting to the three path entering the lane,
and caved between horses while being eased in hand. SERGEANT COUNTZLER saved ground while tracking, but faded. NIKKI'STHEFAVORITE broke a
step slow while leaning in at the start, trailed in the three path, and made little impact. LOUISIANIMAL lacked speed along the inside, and tired. NORTHERN
RUNNER raced far back two wide, and showed little.

Footnotes
RING ME DARLING stalked three wide, bid at the three furlong pole, gained an advantage turning for home, and drew off under driving pressure. SHEZZ
KOLDAZICE hopped slightly at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, tipped to the four path entering the lane to take aim on the new leader, but
failed to keep pace with that foe while claiming place in upper stretch, and just lasted from an outer rival. ZING broke a beat slowly before being slow into
stride, raced far back in the three path around the turn, swung ot the eight path entering the lane, rallied through the final furlong, but just ran out of ground
to reach place. WATERS OF MEROM stalked along the inside, shifted two wide turning for home, but failed to progress. LOMA VISTA tracked in midpack
three to four wide and between horses, got floated to the five path entering the lane, and lacked a bid. STANLEY MARKET broke a step slow, tracked in
midpack four to five wide before tiring while getting floated to the six path entering the lane. DISTORTED SECRETS pressed two wide, led between horses
at the three furlong pole, but offered little resistance to her outer counterpart's challenge turning for home, and gave way. MOHAYLADY raced far back
along the inside, and never got involved. ANNAGANGSTA lacked speed in the three path, came into the lane in the seven path and between horses, and
failed to factor. CANT BE TOUCHED broke sharp and set the pace along the inside, but was headed by a pair of foes at the three furlong pole, and
weakened.

Footnotes
FAST AS FLIGHT bumped with an outer rival into an inner foe at the start, tracked along the inside, loomed from the pocket around the far turn, searched to
split the leading pair in upper stretch, but decided on a rail charge approaching the final furlong, bid leaving that juncture, and edged away through the final
sixteenth. JOYFUL APPLAUSE stalked four to three wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to gain even terms with the leader, chased her through
upper stretch, but was outkicked by a rail bidder in the final furlong, and kept on to reach place. TOERIS set the pace in the two path, showed the way from
a pair of outer bidders around the far turn, dug in while shifting further off of the fence in upper stretch, clung to an advantage from bidders on both sides
entering the final furlong, and was bested. FUENTE OVEJUNA (GB) laid off of the pace three wide, then chased the leading trio evenly through the final
furlong. QUEEN JUDITH laid unhurried in the three to four paths, floated to the six path entering the lane, and only offered a mild kick. DUPLICITOUS
hopped slightly, stalked along the inside, and faded. ELLE OF THE BALL bobbled slightly and bumped an outer foe soon after the start, laid off of the pace
in the two to three paths and between horses, came into the lane in the five path, and lacked a rally. ROC'S PRINCESS bumped and inner foe at the start,
trailed in the two path, then moved up in the final furlong. DAME JOVIALE tracked two wide and between horses, and faded. QUARIA BRAVA prompted the
pace two wide, but weakened between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT RAID tracked from midpack along the inside, bid along the rail entering the lane, and drove clear. RESERVE CURRENCY tracked in the two to
three path, shifted to the four path entering the lane, grinded away, and reached place late. MAASAI WARRIOR raced in midpack two wide and between
horses early on, pursued from the two path around the turn, stayed on to bid for place inside of rivals approaching the final sixteenth, but was outkicked.
CAWKAB broke out, laid off of the pace in the three to two path around the turn, rallied before tipping out to the five path in the final furlong, and stayed on.
VICTORY MARCH shifted to the three path to stalk outside of the pace setter leaving the chute, engaged that foe into the turn, vied before leading briefly
approaching the quarter pole, but was outkicked by an inner rival at that marker, then faltered between horses in midstretch. YORK TAVERN tracked in the
four to five paths, but lacked a bid. BOLD LOOKER raced far back two wide and failed to factor. CANT BE DOIN THAT broke a step slowly and never got
involved. MOUNT CRAIG tossed his head while breaking slow, trailed three wide, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, but lacked a rally. TOWN BRANCH
set the pace in the two path, vied with an outer rival around the turn, but caved between horses entering the lane. ELECTROMAGNETIC chased in the four
path, but bore out around the turn, and bolted entering the lane while being eased.
