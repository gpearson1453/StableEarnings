Footnotes
VIRAT coaxed to the front from inside, set the pace inside TREBBIANO into and around the turn, maintained a short lead into deep stretch and held gamely.
TREBBIANO broke in and bumped rival, drifted in and bumped another rival early on the backstretch, went up to press the leader from outside, hounded
VIRAT into the final sixteenth and could not get by. HYDRO FROST took a bump leaving the gate, stalked two wide then spun three wide into the stretch,
failed to summon the needed rally but bested the rest. STORMING CHROME settled off the pace, raced along the rail into the turn, two wide into the stretch
and failed to threaten while earning a minor award. ANDROS got bumped by TREBBIANO early, stalked the top pair from inside into the turn, saved ground
to the stretch and flattened in the lane. HANDSOME TICKET was off slow to begin, trailed two wide into the turn, exited the bend three wide, then moved
out and failed to make an impact.

SPIRITIST pressed the pace four deep, fought through the turn and took over into the stretch, shook free from inside pair under left handed urging and
inched away while drifting in some. LOOKS RARE shifted out early while displaying speed, vied for command inside a trio of rivals to the turn, battled while
holding a slim advantage around the turn, relinquished the lead with three-sixteenths remaining, could not match strides with the winner nearing the final
furlong but stayed on to prove second best. READY RUMOR got bumped leaving the gate, was prominent then got bumped from outside and forced out to
bump again early, vied between rivals into and around the bend, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch and kept on to save the show. BIG HAT WILLIE
bobbled a bit and bumped leaving the gate, tracked the speed three wide around the turn, kept on through the lane but could not get up for third. BUFFETT
bumped BIG HAT WILLIE at the start, tracked three deep into the turn, went four to five wide around the bend and lacked a rally. GOTCHA LOOKIN broke a
step slow, drifted in and bumped with READY RUMOR twice in the early stages, chased three wide into the lane and weakened. BIG STICK was a bit
fractious in the starting gate, bumped in the beginning, stalked two wide around the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
OVERDUE trailed in the early going, moved closer outside a rival on the backstretch, moved out four wide on the turn then took aim three wide into the
stretch, rallied and drew alongside the leader with a sixteenth to go and got up in the closing moments. COMRADERY (IRE) turned his head at the start and
came away last, tucked inside while at the back then moved into range while a bit keen, tipped out on the far turn and took aim two wide into the stretch,
cleared in upper stretch then met the challenge from OVERDUE in deep stretch and got nailed at the wire. OPRY chased three wide early then moved into
the two path, got shuffled between rivals early on the far turn, angled to the inside then summoned a mild rally from the fence and gained the show. FIRST
PREMIO rated on the inside then moved out first time in the stretch, tracked three deep in the middle stages, four deep into the far turn, chased two wide
into the lane and lacked a late bid. NILES CHANNEL dueled for command from inside, inched clear on the backstretch, challenged from outside into the
lane, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. LEPRINO broke a step slow, started to pull first time in the stretch and clubhouse turn, moved to the
inside, trailed to the far turn, moved out leaving the final bend and failed to threaten. HORN OF PLENTY dueled for command from outside, kept the
pressure on in the middle stages then lost touch with the leader at the seven-sixteenths marker, dropped back between rivals on the far turn and faded in
the lane.

WHERE'S FRANKIE set the pace in the early going, got pressure from outside into the turn, shook free in the two path leaving the bend, led clear into deep
stretch and held well under a drive. FULL OF GRACE chased two wide into the turn, eased out and went three to four wide into the stretch, rallied late and
was gaining to the wire. ROSES R BLUE was off slow to begin, chased in range on the inside through the turn, kept on in the final furlong but lacked a late
bid. MAYCEE JO broke with the leader but also came out at the start, was closest in pursuit from outside early, pressed three wide into the turn, lost touch
leaving the bend and flattened to fourth. SHE LOVES KARAOKE broke out, lost her path behind MAYCEE JO early, chased four wide outside pair of rivals
into the turn, entered the lane four to five wide, weakened in the final furlong, bled following the race and walked off.

Footnotes
BELLSTREET BRIDIE (GB) was closest in pursuit from the two path then moved inside, drew alongside the leader at the half-mile pole, took over then
cleared leaving the backstretch, moved inside on the far turn, showed the way into the stretch and drew off under right handed urging. QUATTROELLE
(IRE) got shuffled into the first turn, stalked on the inside then moved out and took closer order on the backstretch, put in a mild bid from outside with three
furlongs remaining but failed to keep up with the leader around the final bend, churned on through the lane and secure the place. QUEEN OFTHE TEMPLE
got put in tight between rivals chasing around the first turn, angled down to the inside while off the pace, moved out and tried to go between rivals near the
three-eighths pole but had to pause when put in a bit tight, gave chase through the lane and angled out with a sixteenth remaining but could not get by
QUATTROELLE (IRE) for the place honors. SISTER OTOOLE unhurried in the beginning and trailed early on, went three then four deep on the far turn and
lacked the needed rally in the drive. SCARABEA chased outside a rival early, came two wide into the lane, angled to the inside in the stretch and failed to
rally. DUVET DAY (IRE) was off a bit slow from outside, angled down to the two path and settled off the pace, moved into range in the middle stages,
chased three deep then three wide on the far turn and weakened in the lane. LADY JAE had to check along the rail entering the first turn then pulled and
was in a bit tight inside a rival around that bend, was reserved near the back in the early stages, moved closer up the backstretch then steadied at the
three-eighths pole, tipped out with a quarter mile left to run and was not a factor. DRAMATIZER sped to the front and crossed over, set the pace early then
got pressured on the backstretch, lost command at the seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back on the far turn and faded out of contention.

Footnotes
SAWASDEE stepped to the front and moved clear of the field, showed the way two wide around the bend, put to right handed urging in the drive and
remained clear to the wire. SO I'M TOLD forwardly placed near the inside early, saved ground to the stretch, finished willingly down the lane but could not
get to the winner. NOLO CONTESTO got bumped from inside at the start, chased the leader from outside, asked three wide into the lane and flattened in
the final furlong. ROGUE SON was off a bit slow from inside and dropped back, went between rivals into the turn, came two wide into the stretch and
improved position. NICE GUY CLAY chased on the inside into the turn, left the bend two to three wide and failed to rally. STAR SAILOR chased outside a
rival off the pace into the turn, asked right handed around the bend while going between foes, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. SAYERS saved ground near the back and failed to menace. GATOR SHINING broke out, bumped and got crowded at the start, tracked four wide
around the bend and weakened. KEENEYE GEORGE broke out and bothered GATOR SHINING, chased three deep then dropped back into the turn,
trailed four wide into the lane and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
THE WILD GRAZER (IRE) stalked the pace from inside, angled out and came four wide into the lane, bid three deep with a furlong left to run, drifted in then
back out and drove clear. SHIRLEY'S BANE showed early speed between rivals then moved back to a stalking position and steered to the inside, chased
along the rail then tipped out into the stretch, challenged the leader and took over in upper stretch, then relinquished the lead outside the sixteenth pole and
stayed on to hold second. CUTE KHLOE was fractious in the paddock, hard to load prior to the start, got shuffled back between rivals in the beginning, ran
up on heels and had to steady at the three-eighths pole, saved ground to the stretch, angled out past the eight pole and gained the show. HAZANNE got put
in a bit tight between rivals past the half-mile pole, tracked three deep then three to four wide into the lane, moved out and got bumped midstretch and kept
on for a minor award. TENNESSEE MOON set the pace under pressure to the turn, moved clear at the quarter pole, lost command with a furlong left to run
and weakened down the lane. GOLDEN TEMPER chased between then outside a rival out of range early, coaxed two wide into the lane, angled out then
got bumped midstretch and could not rally. SWEET TESSA pressed the pace three deep then outside the pacesetter into the turn, lost touch with a quarter
mile remaining, exited the bend three wide and weakened. SMART KITTEN broke well then chased outside rivals, dropped back around the turn while
angling from the three path down to the rail and came up empty in the drive. KIND OF BLUE was off slow to begin, trailed two wide then along the rail and
failed to make an impact.
