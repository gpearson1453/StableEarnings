Footnotes
STORM BORN was urged clear inside foes racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a comfortable advantage to the second bend, held sway into upper
stretch, was kept to right handed pressure to maintain the advantage then was taken in hand nearing the wire. AWESOME WILLY was prompted to a
forward placing three deep racing just off the pacesetter to the first turn, continued with a steady bid to prompt that rival into upper stretch but could never
gain even terms with that foe while best of the others. I'M YOUR VALENTINE settled between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing
through the far turn and kept on with an effort to earn a share. JACKPOT BOY was settled outside foes to the backstretch, shifted out five wide after the
half, continued in that path through the far turn into upper stretch and passed some tiring foes late. MICHAEL GEORGE tracked off the second flight to the
backstretch, tipped out three wide after a half making some brief progress to close the gap on the leaders but flattened out racing into upper stretch.
ANUNKA, urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the first turn, tracked the leader inside a rival for a half and gave way into the far turn. GRAND
FESTIVAL, restless in the gate prior to the start, stumbled at the break and dropped out early.

Footnotes
HURTS SO BAD pressed the pace outside of BALADINE, engaged two wide at the three eighths, vied from there, came into the lane between horses,
continued to vie outside of BALADINE to the sixteenth and kicked clear. BOONE'S PATH chased inside of UNDEFEATED CHAMP down the back straight,
chased midfield in the two path on the turn, quickly shifted four wide in upper stretch in front of READY MADE, chased on past midstretch, found his best
near the sixteenth but came on too late. BALADINE was urged between horses for pace, raced keenly into the turn, was engaged in earnest by HURTS SO
BAD near the three eighths, vied inside of that foe from there, went to a drive in upper stretch, continued to vie inside of HURTS SO BAD to the sixteenth
mark, and flattened late. CELLULOID HERO tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and in the four path on the turn, loomed three wide into the lane,
went to a drive near the three sixteenths but was no match for the leading pair, and flattened out. TAHKODHA KNIGHT was close up early but soon settled
back at the inside rear of the main group, continued patiently in the two to three path on the turn, swung six wide under a drive into the lane, and passed
tiring horses. PERIPATETIC settled between horses at the rear of the main group, raced toward the rear in the three path around the turn, was driven inside
foes in upper stretch and chased on only evenly. READY MADE settled three wide at the rear of the main group, inched forward when pushed along in the
five path on the turn, greenly veered several paths inward in upper stretch after BOONE'S PATH shifted out in front of him, and had no late kick two wide.
VALIANTLY DISCREET was fractious in the gate, hopped at the break, trailed down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, came three wide into
the lane and offered no rally. LAWMAKER tossed his head at the break and came awkwardly into stride, trailed near the rear down the back straight and in
the four path on the turn, came four wide into the lane and made no bid. UNDEFEATED CHAMP chased outside of BOONE'S PATH midfield early, raced
well behind the leading trio in the four path on the turn, checked approaching the three sixteenths when READY MADE cut inward in front of him, and
emptied out.

Footnotes
STORMIN HONGKONG settled early mid-pack then was ridden along while five wide through the turn and ranged up to contend mid-stretch then ducked in
late before rallying to get up in time. DARK HEDGES hopped at the start then moved up and pressed the pace, led at the 1/4 pole and battled through the
lane but was outfinished. JACK'S ADVANTAGE rated in the second flight early and saved ground through the turn then angled out in the lane and rallied too
late. CHICKS FOR FREE chased early while four wide and made a bid at the leaders at the 1/4 pole then was asked between horses in the stretch and
steadied at the 1/16 pole when STORMIN HONGKONG ducked in then gave way late. BIG PINES SANDY got off a step slowly and was void of early speed
then seemed to battle the kickback through the turn and made no rally. SUN SQUALL broke sharply and set a pressured pace then was headed at the top
of the lane and gave way along the inside.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD BYE chased outside of AHH MAZING early, bid three wide into the turn, engaged outside of YANKEE AGATE three wide near the five
sixteenths, came three wide in range into upper stretch, was briefly outkicked by BELPERRON in upper stretch but continued to give chase, gained well in
the final sixteenth and struck the front five strides from the wire. BELPERRON tracked the leader inside of STEAL MY SUNSHINE, raced along the rail just
off the leader on the turn, bid inside into the lane and kicked to a clear lead, kept on under a drive but was caught five jumps from the finish. YANKEE
AGATE was sent to the lead between horses and cleared near the five eighths, led while positioned two wide on the turn, was engaged by STEAL MY
SUNSHINE and WILDWOOD BYE past the five sixteenths, was outkicked by BELPERRON into upper stretch, chased on to midstretch and was outkicked
late while clearly holding show. STEAL MY SUNSHINE broke sharply, tracked outside of BELPERRON early, continued in the tracking flight between into
the turn, engaged outside of YANKEE AGATE near the five sixteenths in tandem with WILDWOOD BYE, was outkicked into upper stretch and chased on
while drifting in. COWGIRL FRANKIE broke slowly and inward, trailed down the backstretch and while saving ground on the turn, angled out to the five path
in upper stretch, and finished mildly between horses. AHH MAZING chased inside of WILDWOOD BYE early while well behind the tracking flight, saved
ground around the turn and proved no threat in the lane. SURE SHOT ANNIE hit the gate, settled at the rear of the main group, saved ground on the turn,
swung into the lane in the seven path and lacked the needed rally. AWESOME KITTY settled near the rear of the main group outside of SURE SHOT
ANNIE, was pushed along in the five path near the seven sixteenths and offered a mild bid, raced six wide into the lane and flattened. WHITE CASHEL was
slow and awkward out of the gate, settled in front of COWGIRL FRANKIE while detached from the rest of the field, raced in the two to three path on the turn
and had no bid.

Footnotes
SKIP AWAY CARTER raced at the inside of the tracking flight early, was pushed along near the nine sixteenths to keep pace with the tracking flight,
improved along the inside on the turn, engaged inside of KISS N BIZ into upper stretch and took the lead, drifted out but ran on well enough to hold safe.
DASH TO THE CASH was bumped between horses in the opening strides and awkwardly back into stride as a result, settled in the rear trio early, began to
improve inside around the turn, was bumped by J J'S SOLUTION in upper stretch after that one came in, rallied between horses under a drive, kept on well
to the finish but could not reel in the winner. J J'S SOLUTION broke outward, raced toward the rear inside early, gradually improved position in the four path
on the turn, angled inward upper and bumped DASH TO THE CASH, kept on three wide but was outkicked by the leading pair past the furlong mark. KISS
N BIZ was keen to clear, set the pace down the backstretch and in the four path on the turn, was headed by SKIP AWAY CARTER inside him into the lane,
chased while being carried out, and flattened out past midstretch. SENOR MIKE chased inside of INSIDE THE CIRCLE early, was pushed along for a two
wide bid outside of SKIP AWAY CARTER near the seven sixteenths, tracked just behind the tracking flight in the three path approaching the turn for home,
was driven inside into the lane and lacked the needed kick. NAGY AND DA BEARS raced between horses in the rear fight early, was driven in in the four to
five path on the turn, raced a bit greenly in upper stretch and passed tiring horses under a drive. INSIDE THE CIRCLE raced with the tracking flight early but
gradually settled back to a chasing position, continued to lose ground in the six path on the turn, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rerally. SMOOTH
ATTACK tracked the pace three deep early, raced four wide into the turn, tracked in range in the five path on the bend, but emptied out into upper stretch.
KRUELESS was slowly away, settled at the inside of the rear flight, raced in the two path on the turn, was driven in upper stretch and offered no response,
and felt the crop once more near the wire at which point the rider dropped the crop. PUNISH KING tracked the pace between horses, raced three wide
between on the turn, began to weaken at the three eighths, floated five wide into the lane and was allowed to trail home.

Footnotes
RIVZONAROLL broke sharply, was urged to dictate the pace on a narrow margin while angling to the inside, met the challenge of LOOKIN FOR BALA
racing into upper stretch and edged clear late under firm right handed encouragement. The latter was urged to terms prompting the pacesetter through the
backstretch, pressed that foe into upper stretch but proved no match in late stages. CHI TOWN HUSTLER angled to the inside tracking just off the
pacesetter, saved ground to upper stretch and finished evenly through the closing stages while earning a share. RIGHT ON RICHIE settled well off the pace
in the opening quarter, switched off the inside racing into the turn, swung out five wide in upper stretch and continued with a belated effort to gain some
position. FEVER NATION tracked the pace outside foes in second flight in the opening stages, was prompted to advance lodging a brief, three wide bid
nearing upper stretch but flattened out entering the lane. TAHOE RUN was urged to contend inside foes while dropping off the second flight on the
backstretch, faded from contention racing into the turn, then shifted out four wide in the stretch while steadily giving way. HIGHLY PERFECT ducked out at
the start while dropping out last in the opening stages, angled to the inside racing past the five furlong marker, saved ground to upper stretch but offered no
rally. EL MUCHO, off a step slowly, settled between rivals and dropped out of contention early.

FLATOUT WINNER was settled between foes in the last flight racing to the first turn, switched outside rivals entering the backstretch, steadily advanced to
contention four wide racing into the far turn, then continued with a sustained response in that path to wrest command and go clear under firm left handed
encouragement. KHOZAN'S VALENTINE broke through the gate prior to the start, then was a bit reluctant to reload, was urged to terms with the first flight
switching outside the leaders racing through the first turn, pressed the pace outside a rival into the far turn, dispatched that foe in upper stretch but couldn't
fend off the winner. YOU'RE IN COREY, urged along the inside disputing the pace into the first turn, was eased back off the leaders midway through the
backstretch, then behind the second flight into the far turn, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and produced a steady late response to prevail for a
share. IWILLPERSEVERE tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while shifting to the inside on the
far turn, saved ground to the lane and continued evenly to late stages. MR. SOLO, urged pressing the pace outside a rival racing into the first turn, dueled
for command along the inside racing into the far turn and gave way in the drive. HAPPY CAMPER settled last racing to the far turn and proved no threat.
TWOKO BAY tracked off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out on the far turn, angled four wide racing into upper stretch but
offered no rally. SEMINOLE BEACH tracked the leaders inside a rival as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, then emptied out racing into the
far turn. LAVENDER EARL tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch, made some brief progress three wide between foes racing into the
far turn but gave out abruptly nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
BULLDOG OF BERGEN was settled near the inside racing through the backstretch, switched off the inside gathering momentum between foes racing
through the turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and produced a steady late response to prevail in time under energetic handling. IMPERIAL MOMENT
broke readily, pressed the pace three wide through the backstretch into the turn, edged forward midstretch, then resisted the winner's bid but couldn't
contain that rival. PRINCE OF MAYHEM was urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset into the bend, dueled inside a rival past midstretch but
weakened in the last furlong. THE LAST OPTION settled last off the inside racing to the turn, shifted out entering the lane, altered course six wide nearing
midstretch and continued with a mild effort to gain some position. HATCHET CREEK tracked off the first flight along the inside racing into the bend,
switched out in upper stretch, altered course five wide avoiding a tiring foe in the lane but had no closing bid. SIR ACEALOT tracked off the first flight
between foes on the backstretch, tipped out four wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance but came up empty in the drive. PINSON
made brief pursuit of the leaders racing five wide on the backstretch but soon dropped out. DAAHERS BULLY was urged inside rivals disputing the pace
from the outset, dueled inside the leaders into the turn and gave way abruptly after a half.
