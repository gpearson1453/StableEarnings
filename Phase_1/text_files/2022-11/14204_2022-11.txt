Footnotes
IMAGOODFELLA well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, got through inside the leader edging ahead, shook clear, then lasted under steady
pressure. TOES N THE SAND never far back, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and
closed the gap on the winner late. CRUISING DEREK stalked the early pace on the inside, moved up and edged ahead into the turn, shook clear through
the turn, then weakened the final furlong and held the show. CONRADO unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch and passed a tiring rival. FISHERMAN OSCAR set the early pace on the outside, stayed on when challenged into the turn, then faded in the stretch
run. PLEASANT VALIANT was never involved.

Footnotes
FLAG WOMAN set the pace well off the rail, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, shook clear in upper stretch and lasted. FREE SHOT stalked the
pace on the outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick, while clearly best of
the rest. LADYNESS allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled out for clear racing room and
edged up for the show. PEEP'S DAY tracked the pace, dropped back through the turn on the two path, bid three wide into the stretch, then weakened late
and held a share. BINOCHE mid pack and inside, angled two and three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and ran evenly. COLLECTIVE
GOLD well placed and outside, angled in and came through inside into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. WINE WITH A ROSE passed a tiring rival.
LADY KITTY unhurried, looped two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and had no rally.

Footnotes
JUSTINTIMEFORWINE broke sharply and sprinted clear quickly, increased his margin without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the
task. SANDY LANE KITTEN mid pack and inside, moved up on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and
closed well for the place. MOTATAABEQ unhurried, looped up three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and
lacked the needed late kick to gain the place. CASH CALL KITTEN off tardy from the gate as it did not open simultaneously with the others in the race,
allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and edged up for a share.
EXPRESS PHAROAH mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened out. ESPECIALLEA
allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the second turn, came five wide into the stretch and improved position. HOLD THE SPICE allowed to
settle, looped four and five wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. BORGOBYTHESEA stalked the pace in the
early going, could not stay with that one, angled in and chanced through the second turn, then faded in the lane. TREASURE RUN tracked the pace back,
saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch and faded the final furlong. UNCLE ANDREW well placed and outside, held position
three and four wide through the second turn, then faded into the stretch.

stretch and improved position. JAMA DILLON unhurried, looped four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and passed a tiring rival. I'LL FINISH

Footnotes
FATIMA'S BLESSING mid pack and inside, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, angled out for clear racing
room, made a steady gain and drew off late. RAISING MOON allowed to settle, moved up quickly four wide through the second turn to take command, drew
off in the lane, then was no match for the winner late and held the place. ROCK THE STARS well placed, gained position on the two path through the
second turn, came three wide into the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick and held the show. SWING LOW allowed to settle, looped up three and four
wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and closed well for a share. PIRATE PARADE tracked the pace well back, saved ground on
the two path through the second turn, came through on that path and weakened the final furlong. THE SKIPSTER sent from the gate, stalked the early pace
inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside and faded the final furlong. FIERCE WARRIOR allowed to settle, saved ground through the
turns, came through inside and improved position. SOCIALLONGDISTANCE mid pack, moved up three and four wide through the second turn, then had no
stretch rally. FLY FLY AWAY set the pace off the rail and faded through he second turn. ARIES REIGNS was no factor.
