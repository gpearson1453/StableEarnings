COURT RULER (IRE) opened up a clear lead within the initial half mile, maintained that status throughout and drew off commandingly coming around the

and third laps and finished evenly while proving to be no match for the winner. CHOSEN MATE (IRE) raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through
the opening lap, offered a mild bid approaching the second mile and flattened out in the last half mile. SHOOTIN THE BREEZE raced in the middle of the
pack through the opening half mile, dropped back to trail the field for the second time by, pulled up before fence eight and walked off.
