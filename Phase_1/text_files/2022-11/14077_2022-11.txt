KINGDOM QUEEN close up inside early, took over in the two path near the quarter pole then edged off in a moderate drive. JOY'S PRIDE trailed early
outside, split rivals rallying in the stretch to get up for the place. TIZITA prompted the pacesetter in the two path, bid into the stretch then tired. BOSS CARA
angled inside on the turn, swung very wide into the stretch but lacked a response. CLASSY MISS raced within range four wide down the backstretch and
faded. ROMANTIC COMEDY rushed to a clear lead inside for half a mile and weakened. TIZ HER WAY moved inside while well behind early and was
never in contention.

IYIYI controlled the pace inside then held off rivals from both sides through the final furlong. GIRLFROMOUTERSPACE far behind early inside, closed the
gap in the stretch with a gradual gain. TEMPTED TO TOUCH chased well off the leaders in the two path, loomed a threat but tired late.
LOOKINATLIGHTENING prompted the winner for three quarters and weakened slightly. ALL HAIL MO angled closer to the inside before half a mile then
faded on the final turn.

away in upper stretch, widened under urging and was in hand the final strides. RON DON SCORESE stalked the pace, bid three wide on the far turn,
dueled, dug in gamely in the stretch run and earned the place spot. SCREEN SAVER raced off the pace, moved up two wide on the far turn, swung wide
turning for home, rallied mildly outside and earned the show award. BRETT'S WORLD raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn, angled out
entering the stretchm rallied mildly and was outkicked. MY TRAIN was bumped and steadied at the start, rushed up between rivals entering the clubhouse
turn, set the pace, dueled passing the quarter pole, dug in and weakened. PRIVATE NETWORK tracked on the inside, made a rail bid on the far turn,
dueled and gave way. OFF THE MEDS raced four wide early, settled off the pace and was outrun.

HUSHION dueled in the two path, repelled that rival into the stretch, was collared again from his outside and held on tenaciously in a narrow score. IT'S
SIZZLING TIME settled inside the dueling leaders, angled three wide on the turn and continued well in a game try. FOX RED earned a narrow advantage
inside then drifted out tiring in the final furlong. MY FRIENDS BEER trailed well behind through the opening quarter then moved inside on the turn with a
mild bid. CLEMENZA chased wide within range early then began fading on the turn. SNEAKINESS flashed speed outside then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
AMBITIOUSLY PLACED pressed the pace racing close up outside early, chased on the turn, rallied outside in the stretch drive, wore down BACI in deep
stretch and edged away for the win. BACI set the pace on the inside, shook free on the turn, dug in gamely in the stretch run, yielded grudgingly and then
held well for the place spot. CONFIRMED GENIUS chased two wide, then three wide on the turn, rallied mildly outside and dug in to the finish. TARA'S
TALENT chased on the inside, chased on the turn and rallied mildly on the rail in the lane. SENSE A MILLION was bumped at the start, stalked three wide,
chased on the turn and had no rally. ALWAYS A QUEEN was outrun. AWESOME PAL was bumped at the start, stalked four wide, chased and faded.

Footnotes
FLASHNDYNAMITE stalked the pace outside, took over in the final furlong and moved clear and lasted. IT'S SO EASY lagged far behind then finished
strongly outside too late to gain place. AEGEAN SEA controlled the pace inside to midstretch then tired in the final furlong. MIDNIGHT OBSESSION saved
ground just off the pace and flattened out in the stretch. CATTI LA BELLE raced outside within striking range and gave way. MIRTH 'N MERRIMENT broke
awkwardly and ducked out at the start then lost contact with her field.
