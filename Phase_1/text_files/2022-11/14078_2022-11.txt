prove best, driving. HERE WEGO pressed the pace and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole to duel for command, but could not sustain that bid,
second best. AGAINST THE ODDS chased the pace and made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole but flattened out, bested rest. I'M BLAMING YOU
was settled early and saved ground on the turn, then improved in the lane but needed more. DROSSELMOON tracked the early pace and was well placed
on the inside on the turn, swung out three wide leaving the turn but came up empty. KUDURO was settled early, three wide by the quarter pole and had no

STAND BY YOU was reserved early, then advanced swiftly on the inside on the turn, shifted off the inside leaving the five sixteenths, came five wide and
drew off in the lane to prove much the best while under mild right handed crop urging. TODO SOLA set the pace and was in the two path on the turn, proved
no match for the winner while clearly second best. MOONSAFE chased the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but weakened, bested rest. R
AVERIE LYNN stalked the pace three to four wide and weakened. TIMELY TRADITION was settled early and failed to respond. PROPOSITION chased the
