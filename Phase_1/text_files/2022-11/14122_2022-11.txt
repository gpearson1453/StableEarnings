Footnotes
DOC ADAMS switched off the inside and went up to press the leader in the two path, hounded the pacesetter to the eighth pole, took over in midstretch and
drove clear. MISCHIEVOUS PATH took back between rivals early and moved into the to path, stalked between foes through both turns, tipped out in the
lane and rallied to get up for second. FORE FLAG broke alertly and assumed command, steered to the inside and set the pace while under pressure from
DOC ADAMS, maintained a short lead over that rival to the eight pole, relinquished the lead midstretch and got edged for second. J T'S WATCH stalked the
pace on the inside, saved ground behind the leaders through the far turn, moved off the rail in the lane and finished evenly late. WORSE READ SANCHEZ
was off slow to begin, raced three deep at the back on the first turn, moved out four deep at the quarter pole, stayed outside a pair into the stretch and
lacked a bid. BIG HAND coaxed to a forward position outside the top pair into the first turn, chased three deep on the far turn then got shuffled between at
the quarter pole and faded.

BOCHOMBO sped clear from inside, opened up around the turn and showed the way two wide into the stretch and stayed clear under right handed urging.
AS AMATTER OF FACT stumbled leaving the gate, brushed with PRAYER OF JABEZ early, chased two wide into the turn, moved down to the inside then
came off the rail leaving the bend and finished willingly to prove second best. PRAYER OF JABEZ got bumped repeatedly in the early going, stalked
between rivals to the turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. JOKER BOY broke in and bumped repeatedly with PRAYER OF JABEZ early,
stalked the lone leader three deep, came five wide into the drive and weakened.

Footnotes
COUNTESS ROSINA (IRE) settled off the pace on the inside, saved ground through the turn, took off when called upon and inhaled the top trio under right
handed urging. PAMMY'S READY stalked the pace from inside, steered off the inside then got floated out midstretch and outkicked AIN'T EASY for second.
AIN'T EASY broke well then chased ANGELCENTS up the backstretch, was closest in pursuit from the two path around the bend, bid outside in the lane but
drifted out in the furlong grounds and lost the place. ANGELCENTS broke a step slow then rushed up to clear the field, set all the pace on the inside to the
stretch, led clear into the final furlong and yielded in deep stretch. LEXINGTON HUMOR was off slow to begin, trailed on the inside into the turn, moved out
and came three wide into the stretch, steered back to the inside and could not rally. XMAS SURPRISE raced outside a rival near the back, took the turn two
wide then angled out and failed to rally. THAT'S AMARE broke a step slow on the outside, tracked three then two wide on the turn, moved out in upper
stretch and weakened.

SO IT WOULD SEEM chased on the inside early then was guided off the rail, went three deep into the turn, ranged up four deep outside the leaders leaving
the bend, took over with a furlong left to run and drew clear. BOWL OF CHERRIES away quickly in the beginning, pressed the pace between rivals into the
turn, vied for command around the bend, took over into the stretch, lost command with a furlong remaining and stayed on to secure second. LITTLE
RACHEL dropped back early then moved closer from outside, bid three deep around the turn, contested to midstretch and could not match strides late.
WILD ARCH broke well then chased on the inside, hugged the rail to the lane, tipped out in upper stretch and could not rally. SAILING ALONG broke a step
slow then got put in a bit tight between rivals early, chased two wide through the bend, then moved out and lacked further response. FOCUS FIRST broke a
step slow then was coaxed to the front, showed the way under pressure into the turn, vied for the lead with rivals around the bend, lost the advantage
entering the stretch and gave way.

the eight pole and drew off under a drive. SEAL TEAM (GB) tracked outside rivals up the backstretch, raced three deep around the bend, moved out in the
lane and rallied to earn the place. TASTERFOR THE KING forwardly placed four deep early, rounded the bend three deep then came three wide into the
stretch and kept on for the show. CAPTAIN SPARROW dueled for the lead from inside into and around the bend, lost touch with the winner outside the eight
pole and flattened to fourth. ZIHUATANEJO was off slow to begin, trailed early then raced outside a rival into the turn, angled out and came four wide into
the lane and improved position. GOLDENSPA chased along the inside then got put in tight and checked past the half-mile pole, tipped out around the bend
and came three wide into the drive and failed to make an impact. STORM THE NIGHT broke a step slow, chased between in range then steadied into turn,
exited the two wide and weakened. BLUEGRASS GO GO took a bumped from inside leaving the gate, raced in range three deep then checked hard when
put in tight entering the turn, got bothered from inside entering the stretch and lacked a rally. LORD MO broke a step slow, chased between then moved

JUSTIQUE was off slow to begin, lagged behind and taken out wide early, was on the move four to five wide around the bend, reached the front outside the
eight pole, quickly cleared and won going away under hand urging. BLESSED TOUCH chased four deep then outside a pair of rivals into the turn, bid three
then four wide leaving the bend, took over at the top of the lane but was soon passed by JUSTIQUE nearing the eight pole and stayed on to prove second
best. NAUGHTY LOTTIE broke inward then was closest in pursuit of the pacesetter up the backstretch, bid outside the leader two then three wide on the
turn, flattened in the lane but held the show. PARODY came in some at the start and went up to take control early, held a short lead two wide then along the
rail around the bend, lost command at the top of the stretch and weakened down the lane. HUNTINGCOCO stalked the pace and steered down to the
inside, pushed on two wide into the lane, lost her path and altered out in upper stretch and could not rally. DADDY CLASSY DILL stumbled leaving the gate,
stalked five deep in the early going, dropped back and moved down to the three path around the bend and faded. SMOKEM FOR YOU chased between
then three deep early, raced three wide into the turn, started to retreat and moved down to the rail and tired in the drive.

ONE MORE BID bumped and checked along the rail into the first turn, well placed after settling on the inside, waited for room leaving the far turn, altered
out midstretch and got up three deep at the wire. DANCING RINCA rated in the two path early, moved out a bit on the backstretch, asked three wide around
the far turn, took over in the final sixteenth but got nailed by the winner. QUINTECENTS went between rivals at the front and bumped ONE MORE BID into
the first turn, switched outside the leader giving chase, bid two wide with three furlongs remaining, took over at the eight pole but got outkicked in the final
sixteenth. ONE TIME MARK sped to the front and angled in when clearing around the clubhouse turn, showed the way up the backstretch, met the
challenge from QUINTECENTS at the three-eighths pole, maintained a short lead to upper stretch, lost command at the eight pole and stayed on for a minor
share. IRISH PROPHET was forced to check nearing the clubhouse turn, tracked two wide out of range, between into the far turn, stayed in the two path
then moved out in the lane but lacked the needed final kick. TOKAMAK settled inside then had to check off heels early, trailed into the far turn, tipped two
wide exiting the bend, angled inside a rival midstretch and kept on while unable to threaten. SIX MAGPIES (IRE) was off slow to start, raced two wide
outside a rival at the back early, went three deep into the far turn, moved out in the lane and could not rally.

Footnotes
THE CHOSEN VRON bumped leaving the gate, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, engaged BIG CITY LIGHTS at the three-eighths pole, raced on
even terms with a quarter mile remaining, took over leaving the turn, inched ahead in upper stretch and drew clear when flagged with the right hand. BIG
CITY LIGHTS got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, sped clear and set the pace two wide into the turn, challenged by THE CHOSEN VRON around
the bend, lost the lead entering the stretch, fought to the eighth pole then lost touch with the winner midstretch and kept on to save the place. COALINGA
ROAD bumped BIG CITY LIGHTS at the start then dropped back, trailed on the inside through the turn, steered out in the lane and put in a mild late bid but
could not get up for second. NONE ABOVE THE LAW stalked in range off the rail to the turn, rounded the bend three to four wide and failed to respond in
the lane.
