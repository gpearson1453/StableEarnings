Footnotes
NEURAL NETWORK four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced on the front and swung four wide into upper stretch, took over
command with three-sixteenths to go and drew clear under a drive kept to task. BOURBON CHASE chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the
quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, kept on to secure the place honors. DRAKE'S PASSAGE chased three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. WANNA WINNA coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off
the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. OCTOBER BLISS five
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and tired. UNCLE MARTY chased just off the inside until tipped three wide at the half mile pole as EDITOR'S CHOICE tucked in front along
the inside, floated four to five wide placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, cornered four wide into upper stretch and tired. EDITOR'S CHOICE stumbled
at the start recovering inwards, chased four paths off the inside until tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing along the inside
midway on the turn, continued along the rail into upper stretch, faltered and was eased home to the finish. Please note due to a teletimer malfunction all
splits and the final time were unavailable and times provided were omitted pending review.

Footnotes
TRADE SECRET moved in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied along the rail while inside of multiple foes on the turn,
dueled with the runner-up in the stretch, swapped back to her inside lead outside the sixteenth-pole, fought on determinedly to the wire and narrowly
prevailed under strong urging. FUNWHILEITLASTED tracked the pace on the outside, issued a challenge in the four path on the turn, dueled outside of the
winner in the stretch and was denied while clear for the place. MY FIRST LOVE was taken in hand early then prompted the pace, vied in the two path while
between foes on the turn and weakened while able to get the show. VALLARAND settled off the pace, was roused while two then three wide early on the
turn, shifted four wide while asked for more at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. VOICE OF
SPRING was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, moved up on the outside, was asked in the five path on the turn and came up empty. TACTICAL
RANGE broke out and bumped with a foe, stalked the pace down the backstretch, vied three wide while asked between foes on the turn, dropped back into
upper stretch and capitulated. STORMI CAT LADY bumped with a rival at the start, settled at the rear, went four to five wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
FROMANOTHAMUTHA pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, took a short lead outside the quarter-pole, came under a
drive in upper stretch, battled with two foes into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong urging. MAJOR SPIN was hustled to the front, showed the
way with some company to his outside, vied in the two path around the turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole, fought on well with the winner into the
final furlong, battled into the final sixteenth and was outfinished late while just able to get the place. MO REWARDS stumbled outward at the start and was
off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, settled at the rear, gained five wide around the turn, made a bid near the five-sixteenths, battled outside into the
final sixteenth and was out-kicked then just missed the place while clear for the show. TWO DOWN bumped with a rival at the start, settled just off the pace
on the outside, was asked four wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. KONG LOVES A FIGHT moved out while
settling off the pace, was urged along passing the five-eighths, started the turn in the two path, shifted four wide before the five-sixteenths, came seven wide
into the stretch and failed to threaten. SIR JOHN bumped with an opponent at the start, tracked the pace on the inside of a foe, was urged along in the two
path on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and failed to respond. HOLLYWOODHELLRAISR settled off the pace, was urged along passing the
half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
ROSSA VELOCE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the two path
into upper stretch, edged clear to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat and held safe to prevail. BEGUINE broke out at the start, chased four wide
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong but
was ultimately rebuffed at the finish while well clear of the rest and along second best. JANE GREY six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to
the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show
honors over a trio while never threatening the top pair. RUVIES IN TIME coaxed from the start, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, continued four to five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top duo while keeping on under a drive to procure the last major share.
MOMMASGOTTARUN coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, cornered just off the inside into upper
stretch, weakened in the late stages. BABA coaxed from the start, chased three wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, continued three wide into
upper stretch, weakened in the late going. FIRING CAROL fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch
before tucking three wide half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and tired. MIDTOWN ROSE
chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
BIG EVEREST (GB) went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace on the inslide, responded well when let out ever so slightly in upper stretch, was
coaxed a touch coming to the furlong marker and held sway under a very confident mild-hand ride. SHADOW SPHINX was rated just off the pace on the
inside, drafted behind horses around the far turn, was given his cue at the quarter-pole, moved off the rail while chasing under a drive into the final furlong,
gained into the final sixteenth and missed while clear for the place. PAO ALTO (FR) tracked the pace on the outside in the three path, ranged up to make a
bid at the five-sixteenths, chased the winner into the final furlong and was outfinished while able to get the show. DECORATED INVADER was taken in
hand early then reserved in the two path, brushed with a foe while tipping to the three path at the five-sixteenths, was asked for his best in upper stretch and
lacked the needed response. AIRMAN broke out and was off a couple lengths slow, went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, was roused three
then four wide on the far turn, brushed with a rival at the five-sixteenths and was no factor. HOMER SCREEN (BRZ) stalked the pace on the outside in the
two path, was asked on the far turn, chased into the stretch and came up empty.

fended them off to prevail. CHIEF ENGINEER coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand three then two wide under pressure from a flanking pair, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in and was headed for the front a furlong out, fought on gamely between rivals
to preserve the place honors on the wire. EIGHT AND SAND hustled from the start, prompted the aforementioned foe from the outside four then three wide
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive battling on game to the finish but was ultimately
repelled at the end while well clear for the show honors. GIMMEBACKMYBULLETS five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four to five
wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and kept on for the last major share. CALLALOO

coaxing from the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals in the drive. ESCAPE MISSION broke in at the start causing
