Footnotes
EVERYOTHERWON vied for the early lead racing two-wide, took the lead from Especially You nearing the quarter pole and gradually drew clear.
FUNNYBET was allowed to settle in stride early, rallied four-wide into the stretch and finished strongly. AIDANIKE stalked the pace from along the outside,
moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole but lacked the needed late response. LOOKIN ROYAL was prominently placed while racing
two-wide and finished in a mile rally. ESPECIALLY YOU saved ground setting the pace to the quarter pole and weakened. LA TOURISTA was unhurried
early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and finished willingly to end up on even terms with Especially You. ANCIENT BROWN dropped back early and
showed little in a dull effort.

Footnotes
FREE SPIRITED was forwardly placed from the start, moved closer nearing the half mile pole racing three-wide, responded to pressure during the drive and
finished strongly to be up in the final strides. GOODBETTERBEST saved ground setting the pace, opened clear nearing the eighth pole and just failed to
last. FROSTY DIVA prompted the pace while racing two-wide to the stretch and held on well during the drive. LADY ENVOY was unhurried early, rallied
four-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. RIGHT NOW was allowed to settle in stride, came three-wide entering stretch and went evenly late. TRIBAL
SPIRIT dropped back early, came five-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. SIMPERING SMILE saved ground stalking the pace for five furlongs and
then gave way.

Footnotes
FULL CHARGE was allowed to settle in stride while racing two-wide, moved up strongly after a half mile, took the lead from Silver Dust entering the stretch
and then was fully extended to just last. GO EMI was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch, was bumped by Bluegrass Park leaving the quarter
pole and then finished fast to just miss. BANDIT SWANSON was prominent early racing along the inside, dropped back slightly after five furlongs, then
angled to the outside nearing the three-sixteenths pole and was coming on again late. BLUEGRASS PARKWAY was reserved off the early pace, came
three-wide into the stretch, then came out to bump Go Emi leaving the quarter pole and finished willingly. SILVER DUST saved ground setting the pace to
the stretch and weakened. HUGE BIGLY saved ground stalking the pace but lacked a response when asked. MAX EXPRESS dropped back early and was
not a factor.

DRIVE FOR FUN saved ground setting the pace, responded to pressure and maintained a safe advantage. MIACOMET was reserved off the pace, came
five-wide into the stretch and finished strongly. FRENCH COMPOSER was allowed to settle in stride early, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a
mild rally. CHASING RAINBOWS prompted the pace from along the outside into the stretch and weakened late. CARBONITE was fractious during the post
parade, then was off a step slow, moved up along the inside to be prominently placed but lacked a rally. CENTURION dropped back early and failed to
seriously threaten.

RUTHLESS RUA vied with Sure Can for the early lead, shook that one off after three furlongs and drew clear late while being ridden out. D'ORO STREET
was bumped at the start byu Badgeland, then moved up to stalk the pace, moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole, could not reach the
winner but finished well for the place. BOARDWALK QUEEN ducked out at the start, then was reserved off the pace while racing two-wide and finished in a
mild rally. AMERICAN FAIRYTALE was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and went evenly late. BADGELAND broe in to bump D'oro Street,,
then dropped back and failed to be a serious factor. SURE CAN saved ground setting the pressured pace for three furlongs and then gave way readily when
headed.

OLLIEMEISTER was reserved off the early pace, came three-wide into the stretch while splitting rivals, angled out for room nearing the eighth pole and
finished fast to be up in the final sixteenth and win going away. COLD AS HELL set the pressured pace while racing slightly off the rail, was unable to resist
the winner late but held on gamely for the place. FLAGS UP saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through during the drive and finished fast.
BRAWNDO prompted the pace from along the outside and held on well during the drive. LUCKY BOSS was forwardly placed from the start, moved up
three-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole but lacked the needed late response. MONEY MIKE was allowed to settle in stride, came four-wide into the
stretch but lacked a rally. RED LABEL dropped back early, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. STONEVICIOUS gave way after
showing brief speed from along the inside. UPSTRIKER steadied repeatedly while in tight between horses from the five-eighths pole to near the half mile
pole, then was forwardly placed to the stretch and tired.

POWDER RIVER set the pace racing slightly off the rail, responded when headed nearing the eighth pole to regain the lead and proved best under strong
handling. ILLIOGAMI was forwardly placed while racing between horses, angled out slightly to come four-wide into the stretch and finished strongly.
TEMPER TIME prompted the pace from along the inside, moved up to gain a slight lead nearing the eighth pole but was unable to match strides with the
winner late in a game try. MISTY VEIL saved ground stalking the pace, lacked room nearing the quarter pole, angled in nearing the eighth pole and finished
willingly. JAG WARRIOR raced six-wide to the stretch, angled in slightly during the drive but lacked the needed late response. TAP DANCING LADY
dropped back early, saved ground and was not a factor. DOROTHEA was forwardly placed to the stretch while racing three-wide and tired. MICROCAP
raced two-wide early, angled out for the drive and failed to threaten. PRINCESS OF CAIRO raced three-wide and failed to menace.

INVULNERABLE saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged by Commerce Comet in the stretch and was fully extended to prevail
narrowly. COMMERCE COMET was prominent from the beginning, moved up three--wide to offer a bold bid nearing the eighth pole, dueled with the winner
from that point and just missed. UNCLE REG saved ground while being allowed to settle, steadied in tight nearing the three-eighths pole, angled out for
room and finished strongly. SPEAKINOFTHEDEVIL was unhurried early, rallied three-wide into the stretch and gained his best stride too late. ONASA
prompted the pace from along the inside to the stretch, angled in during the drive and held on stubbornly during the drive. HARDMONEYMUCHACHOS
dropped back early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and was gaining ground late. BRAZEN BOY was close up while racing four-wide but lacked a rally.
STUCK N SNOW settled in the middle of the field while saving ground, angled out for the drive and failed to seriously threaten. DAKOTA RUN was
forwardly placed while racing two-wide and weakened during the drive. STRAY CAT lacked early speed and was not a factor. AERATOR dropped back
early and failed to mance. CRAVENSWORTH dropped far back early, was distanced and then pulled up in the stretch and was walked off.

PLAYED HARD bobbled slightly at the start and broke in, then set the pace racing removed from the rail and maintained a safe advantage. BELLAMORE
was allowed to settle in stride, moved up three-wide nearing the half mile pole, offered a bid entering the stretch, could not reach the winner but was clearly
second best in a game try. SHE'S ALL WOLFE was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and was gaining ground late. MOON SWAG was
pinched back at the start, then was reserved off the early pace, moved up along the inside to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole and then flattened out
during the drive. LEADER OF THE BAND saved ground stalking the pace for six furlongs and weakened. AVA'S GRACE prompted the issue racing
three-wide for six furlongs and tired.

Footnotes
DALIKA (GER) saved ground setting the pace in hand, responded when asked and maintained a safe advantage. PERSEVERANCIA was reserved off the
early pace, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished fast. ADVENTURING stalked the pace while
racing behind the winner, angled out nearing the quarter pole for room, but lacked the needed late response. SUNNY ONE was reserved off the early pace,
rallied four-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. LAKE LUCERNE was hard held early while settling off the early pace, saved ground and went
evenly late. FLIPPANT was reserved off the early pace, moved up five-wide nearing the stretch but lacked a rally. PASS THE PLATE was unhurried early,
came six-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. CURLY RUTH prompted the issue from along the outside for six furlongs and weakened.
DISAPPEARING ACT dropped back early and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SECRET STATEMENT saved ground setting the pace, responded when headed by Icicles nearing the eighth pole and proved narrowly best in a stiff drive.
ICICLES was off a step slow, then worked her way forward between horses on the backstretch to prompt the pace, gained a slight lead nearing the eighth
pole and the just missed in a hard drive. EYES OF GOLD was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole,
could not reach the top two but finished well in a steady effort. LADY WITH A CAUSE was unhurried early, came six-wide into the stretch and was making
up ground late. TITUBA was pinched back at the start, moved up strongly between horses on the turn to off a bid and then hung. RING TWICE broke in,
then dropped back and failed to threaten. MISCHIEVOUS GAL broke out, then was forwardly placed along the inside for a half mile and weakened.
PERFECT ROSE was prominently placed for a half mile while racing three-wide and tired. GRAY VIXEN showed early speed while racing four-wide and
gave way.
