secure place. CURLIN BLESSING prompted the pace from the two path, was ridden from the five path into the stretch, but flattened out late for show. RED
VENUS rated in the three path but was no factor. BOLD REY stalked in the five path early but gaveway rounding the far turn. KYNLIE'S EMPIRE set the

MIRACLE OF HOPE stalked from inside, was cued to bid around the turn, took the lead from inside into the stretch, and drew clear. NOEL'S ANGEL set the
pace in the two path, was roused entering the lane, and ran on to hold place. ELDORADO DREAM had a slow start, trailed from the four path, tucked in
around the turn, was driven from the two path into the stretch, and kept on for show. WAIT A SEC prompted the pace from the three path but was one
paced through the stretch. LOTSA LACE tracked from the five path, swung out to the six path turning into the stretch, but finished evenly. HINDU MISS
CHEF chased from the three path early but was no menace.

Footnotes
CANNONBALL COMIN set the pace from inside, was roused from the three path turning into the stretch, dug in, lost the crop in final strides, but held on
gamely. MISTER MCLEAN prompted the pace from the two path, made a bid from the four path into the stretch, but hung late to place. STAY HAPPY
tracked in the three path, tipped out to the six path entering the lane, and kept on for show. PICK YOUR BID stalked from inside, was roused from the two
path into the lane, but finished evenly. SHANE ZAIN broke out at the start, rated from the three path but was one paced through the stretch.
DON'TTEASETHETIGER raced from wellback in the four path early and was no threat. MIKE OPERATOR chased in the five path but was no menace.
MAKAH LANE steadied early, trailed while very wide and was always behind. DUE TO A TIMING MALFUNCTION THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
COASTAL WATERS rated in the two path, took aim while shifting out to the five path entering the lane, and rallied. BROTHERLY LOVE set the pace from
inside, dug in when headed at the top of the stretch, and held on to place. MOOGIE SON rated from the two path, swung out to the eight path going into the
stretch, and ran on down the center for show. LIGHTNING STAR prompted the pace while three wide but gaveway in the final furlong.
GODGUNSNCOUNTRY pressed the pace from two wide, was roused between rivals into the stretch, but faded. MINNESOTA RED tracked in the five path
but finished evenly through the stretch. MR LOVE MUFFIN was held up from the four path early but never factored. BLUES RAPPER was in the five path
early and always behind. THE THIRD RING stalked from inside but was empty going into the stretch. DUE TO A TIMING MALFUNCTION THIS RACE WAS
HAND TIMED.
