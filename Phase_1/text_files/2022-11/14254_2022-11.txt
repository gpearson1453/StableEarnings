CASSIE'S RAINBOW pressured the pace shaking clear on the turn drawing off in upper stretch widening as much the best. LEADING INDICATOR tracked
the pace through the turn emerging off a loose leader in upper stretch holding well late as second best. AVENIDA MANANA raced evenly outbidding the
others. LIGHT HEARTED slow early was never in true contention. CYBERBURG was never involved. BEND THE KNEE pressed then chased on the turn
giving way in upper stretch.
