HOLIDAY DANCER laid close up while saving ground surging from the rail to put a head in front at the quarter pole shaking clear in upper stretch holding
firm on the inside. RICKI TORNADO stalked the pace pressing into the far turn dueling to the quarter pole being turned away in upper stretch angling out
past mid track late a clear second best. PRETTY LOUD slow early circled out to upper stretch racing evenly from mid track down the lane to best the others.
BARELYSTILLCOUNTS was never involved. EL DUQUE raced evenly through the far turn fading along the inside in upper stretch. SHE AINT NO JOKE
hustled out pressed on a narrow lead through the turn then wilted in upper stretch. DIAMOND MONEY pressed the pace through the backside then folded
abruptly on the far turn.
