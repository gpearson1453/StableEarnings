Footnotes
GRAND HIDEAWAY was forward early, settled back to chase behind the tracking flight into the turn, saved ground around the bend, was driven for a rail
rally into the lane, led just past the furlong mark and cleared. UPBEAT MELODY soon led, was briefly engaged by RONNI'S STORM into the turn but
cleared again near the three eighths, led into the stretch, was engaged by GRAND HIDEAWAY to his inside into the lane, lost the lead to that foe just past
the furlong mark and chased on second best. THE BOSS FACTOR settled toward the rear early, bid into the turn and improved to midfield in the four path,
angled out in upper stretch, ran on willingly four wide and wrested the show late. SAMURAI MIKE tracked the leader early, continued in range of the leading
pair on the turn, joined inside of RONNI'S STORM approaching the quarter, proved no match for UPBEAT MELODY and GRAND HIDEAWAY into the lane
but chased on with interest, though lost the show late. REMEMBER THE MAINE settled toward the rear inside early, was pushed along past the three
eighths, angled seven wide into the lane, and finished belatedly outside. RONNI'S STORM tracked the early pace, briefly engaged outside of UPBEAT
MELODY into the turn, lost some position when cornering into the turn in the six path, tracked in the five path on the turn, proved no match for the leader
into the lane and gradually flattened. APPLICANT chased inside, saved ground through the turn, and ran evenly in the lane. RIVER FINN settled three and
then two wide toward the rear, chased two wide around the turn, and had no kick in the lane. DRAMATIC KITTEN raced between horses early, settled back
to second last into the turn, raced in the four to five path around the turn, was driven eight wide into the lane and passed tiring horses. STORMIN EL
PRADO raced midpack early, advanced into the turn to track the leaders, was between horses in range at the quarter, but proved no match into the lane
and weakened between horses. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE settled at the rear, raced in the five to six path on the turn, swung seven wide into the lane and
had no rally. MASTER GUNS was extremely fractious and rearing in the gate before the start, reared again at the start and unseated his rider, was
apprehended after the race by an outrider and walked off. THE STEWARDS MADE A GENERAL INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE. UPON
REVIEW, THEY DETERMINED THAT MASTER GUNS WAS A STARTER.

Footnotes
GHALY POSSE broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage along the inside to the turn, kicked clear nearing upper stretch and held sway. on a
safe margin to the end under pressure. RAINY MOUNTAIN angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing into the turn, tipped out racing through
the stretch while being urged to advance but proved only second best. WILDWOOD GHALY ducked inwards at the start while getting away slowly, settled
last along the inside early, saved ground to upper stretch steadily regaining contention, then tipped three deep in the last sixteenth while prevailing for a
share. USA USA USA tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and continued with an effort to
improve position. TENSE was urged between foes prompting the pacesetter to the turn and steadily faded into upper stretch. SILVER EYES, urged to a
forward placing between rivals tracking just off the pacesetter to the turn, faded nearing upper stretch. MAZLAN proved no threat. LONGLIVEROCKNROLL
was a brief factor four wide tracking the pacesetter in second flight racing to the turn but gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
RED HOT DEVIL was placed on the lead, took pressure early from MY LITTLE TIPSY, edged clear into the turn, set the pace while clear in the two to three
path around the bend, floated into the lane in the six path, and held the advantage under a hand ride and while being shown the crop late. IRISH TUFF
chased inside of TURN THE SWITCH down the back straight, kept on behind the leading trio in the five path on the turn, swung into the lane in the six path,
and kept on willingly to the finish. TURN THE SWITCH chased two wide early, was patient in the two to three path on the turn, offered an inside bid into the
lane and kept on mildly for show. MY LITTLE TIPSY prompted the pace outside of RED HOT DEVIL early, tracked that foe in the three path on the turn, was
driven in the three path in upper stretch but proved no match for RED HOT DEVIL, and weakened from midstretch. DEVIL'S RULE settled at the rear, was
urged in the five path on the turn while still racing with the rear pair, came into the stretch in the six path, and proved no threat under a drive.
TOUCHOFCHILIPEPPER attended the pace three wide early, settled back to track the leading pair into the turn, raced in the four path around the bend,
chased between horses in upper stretch but proved no match for the leading pair, and emptied out. GOLDENPENCE settled near the rear, raced in the rear
pair in the four path on the turn inside of DEVIL'S RULE, came into the lane in the five path and had no rally.

Footnotes
SEAWARD was rated outside foes tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance in the opening half, advanced four wide racing into the far turn,
continued with a steady bid to wrest the advantage leaving the furlong marker and went clear under firm right handed encouragement. KINGSBURY
DREAM, reserved while angling to the inside in the opening half, swung out four wide racing through the far turn, was fanned six wide in upper stretch and
continued with a steady late response to prevail for the place honors. ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the far
turn, saved ground through the second bend, tipped off the inside entering upper stretch, was urged to advance while being caught in tight quarters between
foes racing past midstretch but edged ahead to prevail for a share. ON A TOUR, reserved while angling inside in the opening stages, switched out entering
the backstretch, shifted three deep after a half, was prompted to advance in that path between foes on the far turn, swung out five wide in upper stretch and
continued with interest to gain some position. DAIGLE, urged to the lead while angling sharply to the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a
narrow margin to upper stretch and gave out once headed by the winner. SHE'S WANDAFUL, prompted to a forward placing inside foes in the opening
stages, was held up off the pacesetter when losing her path to that foe nearing the first turn, tracked the leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight
racing to the far turn and steadily faded into upper stretch. AROSE FOR LYLA settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled to the
inside racing through the far turn, then tipped off the inside in the stretch to pass between some tiring foes. STACK SHACK, urged to a forward placing three
deep racing to the first turn, angled inwards nearing the backstretch prompting a rival's pace to the second bend and gave way into the lane. ZANDREA'S,
urged to a position tracking just off the first flight while going a bit erratically, angled to the inside nearing the second bend, continued saving ground on the
far turn and emptied out leaving the quarter mile marker. SENSE OF SELF, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter to the
backstretch, was urged to lodge a brief bid between foes racing into the far turn, then gave way into the lane. SILVERA, carried wide racing to the first turn
by GOOD MONGOLIA, angled inwards nearing the backstretch to track off the second flight between rivals but steadily faded after a half. GOOD
MONGOLIA raced five wide into the first turn carrying out SILVERA and emptied out early.

Footnotes
READTHECLIFFNOTES broke midpack but improved position without hard urging and cleared into the first turn, took light pressure from WILDWOOD
SICILIAN into the backstretch, inched clear again near the five eighths, saved ground around the far turn and maintained a lead while being pushed along,
was driven in upper stretch, was briefly headed by BANDIT SWANSON midstretch, vied gamely to the sixteenths, and cleared again late. BANDIT
SWANSON tracked the leading pair around the first turn, continued to track outside of CAPTIVATING MOON down the back straight, raced three wide in
range on the far turn, was pushed along approaching the five sixteenths, came five wide into the lane, loomed near the three sixteenths, headed
READTHECLIFFNOTES midstretch, vied to the sixteenth but was no match late. CAPTIVATING MOON chased inside around the clubhouse turn, inched
forward inside of BANDIT SWANSON on the backstretch to track the pace, hugged the rail on the far turn, came into the lane inside behind
READTHECLIFFNOTES, angled out in upper stretch, kept on willingly to the finish but missed the place. DEVIL VISION chased three wide through the
clubhouse turn, raced toward the rear outside of HOT SHOT KID down the backstretch, was pushed along in the four path on the far turn and offered a
circling rally, raced six wide into the lane, sustained his rally in upper stretch but leveled out late. RICHIESGOTGAME settled at the rear, was nudged along
between horses near the nine sixteenths, raced in the three path on the far turn, was driven five wide into the lane and lacked the needed rally. WILDWOOD
SICILIAN was restless in the gate, broke sharply and raced keenly early, tracked READTHECLIFFNOTES when that foe cleared into the first turn, prompted
outside of READTHECLIFFNOTES down the back straight, stalked two wide around the far turn, was driven three wide in upper stretch but proved no match
and weakened. HOT SHOT KID chased between horses through the first turn, raced inside of DEVIL VISION toward the rear down the back straight, was
outpaced in the two path on the far turn and offered no response.

Footnotes
JOLIE RULER, prompted to a forward placing inside foes in the opening stages, tipped off the inside to track the pacesetter into the bend, shifted to the
three path racing to upper stretch steadily advancing on the pacesetter, then took over late to go clear under firm handling. RANK AND FILE, reluctant to
load, threw her head at the start while breaking awkwardly, angled inside on the backstretch, steadily gathered momentum switching out racing into upper
stretch, split foes three deep while shifting out bumping ALMAFUERTA in late stages but continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. COOKIN
ROSES joined the pace three deep in the opening stages, moved clear while angling to the inside racing into the turn, held sway on a clear margin to upper
stretch but faltered leaving the furlong marker. ALMAFUERTE, forwardly placed between foes in the opening stages, tracked the pacesetter outside the
eventual winner racing three deep into the bend, was carried out four wide by that foe racing into upper stretch, then was bumped in late stages while
lacking the needed final kick. KITTEN ROCKS angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing into the bend, saved ground on the turn and faded
into upper stretch. COUGER settled between foes in early stages, angled five wide racing into upper stretch but made no real impression. PRANCIPANTS
settled outside foes in early stages, continued four deep into the turn, was fanned six wide in upper stretch but never proved a serious threat. STERN
tracked off the second flight three wide between foes on the backstretch but retreated early. CATANIA raced four deep between foes in the opening stages,
was pulled up nearing the turn, then was vanned off the course following the race.

Footnotes
WALKER'S WIN broke near the rear but was a bit keen to assume a tracking position inside, made a rail-skimming bid inside of REDNECKERTHANYOU
past the three eighths, took the lead inside that foe near the five sixteenths, was pushed along into the stretch and opened up, and drew off while kept to
task until the last few strides. REDNECKERTHANYOU set the pace, was engaged approaching the half by FOLLOW THE SIGNS to his outside, took
pressure from that foe while leading two wide on the turn, was engaged by WALKER'S WIN to his inside and headed by that foe near the five sixteenths,
prove no match for that foe into the lane, chased on with continued interest down the lane while vying with FOLLOW THE SIGNS and got the bob for place.
FOLLOW THE SIGNS stalked the leader between horses early, joined outside him approaching the half in tandem with MAC PANDOWDY, attended the
pace three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the lane, proved no match for WALKER'S WIN from the top of the stretch, chased on willingly while battling
with REDNECKERTHANYOU but lost the nod for place. BEEALEA settled toward the rear, raced in the three to four path on the turn outside of ANDREW
THE GIANT, swung out and was driven seven wide into the lane, and rallied mildly outside foes. BRUCE BANNER chased just behind the stalking flight
early, chased midpack in the two path on the turn, was driven inside in the lane and ultimately did not have enough to threaten. MAC PANDOWDY stalked
the pace three wide early, joined the leader three wide approaching the half, soon settled back to track the leading line in the four path on the turn, was no
match into the lane and gradually flattened. ANDREW THE GIANT settled toward the rear, raced in the two path on the turn, swung five wide into the lane
and chased on mildly. COMISKEY PARK stumbled out of the gate, settled at the rear, raced with the rear pair in the three path on the turn, came six wide
into the lane and had no rally. ROCKET HOTSHOT settled in the rear pair, raced in the four to five path on the turn, swung out near the center of the track
for the drive and mustered no rally. COURTHOUSE COVE chased two wide down the backstretch and through the turn, was driven in upper stretch, altered
three wide behind traffic in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI SILVER was prompted to a forward placing along the rail, stalked just off the leaders along the inside racing into the bend, briefly awaited an
opening between foes racing into the stretch, then altered course three wide in late stages to prevail in time under firm handling. KANITHAPPEN was urged
to the inside disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, dueled for command to late stages but couldn't contain the winner while narrowly prevailing for
the place honors. DYNAMOMETER bobbled at the start, was righted to track off the first flight four wide through the backstretch into the turn, continued in
that path through the stretch and made some late progress to close the gap while missing for second. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE was urged from the break
prompting the pace outside a rival, pressed the issue on the turn past midstretch but flattened out late. JACKS SPRING BREAK tracked the leaders
between foes in second flight in the opening stages, switched outside rivals after the opening quarter, continued five wide into upper stretch and finished
evenly late. CLASSOFSIXTYSEVEN, held up avoiding close quarters racing through the chute, shifted inwards to track off the second flight near the inside
racing to the turn, shifted out three wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to gain some position between rivals late. MYNAMEIS PRINCE broke
outwards brushing KANITHAPPEN, was righted to stalk off the first flight between foes racing into the bend, but steadily faded into the lane. LARK broke
awkwardly, then switched out six wide racing through the backstretch and continued with an even effort in that path to late stages. TEA AFTER BALLET
was rated off the second flight between rivals on the backstretch, angled to the inside entering the turn and faded into upper stretch. DARE GOES DA
DEVIL settled inside foes in early stages and failed to menace thereafter. MADELYNS HEAT, caught in close quarters through the chute, raced five wide
through the backstretch and soon retreated. WELLER ROGUE, caught in close quarters in the opening stages, soon dropped out.
