Footnotes
SHANIA SEA set the pace while clear on the inside, then remained clear by the furlong marker and then was kept to left handed crop pressure to prove
best. SUZY Q THE QUEEN was settled back early on the outside, then advanced four wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane and rallied. MASKED
HEROINE was bumped hard at the start, then was reserved early and was two wide by the quarter pole, dropped to the inside leaving the turn and finished
well on the inside to just miss the place award. MAMBA QUEEN was fractious in the gate, chased the pace three wide and weakened in the lane.
TALENTED TAPPER was allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn and had no rally. PARABLE was allowed to settle on the inside, swung out five
wide leaving the turn and had no rally. SHOYYOOKH broke in at the start, settled and was three wide on the turn and then was empty.

second best. VALENTINA'S CUPID chased the pace on the inside and had no rally, bested rest. SIMPLE JUSTICE chased the pace three wide and tired.
MEEMOO pressed the pace three wide and then stopped.

NEON SIGN was away alertly to set the pace on the inside, then turned back a bid on the turn and shook clear leaving the turn, then held sway late to prove
best, driving. OUT OF STOCK tracked the early pace four wide, made a three wide move on the turn, then continued willingly to the wire but could not get to
the winner, good effort. GOLDEN TREASURE walked out of the gate eight lengths last, then advanced three wide on the turn and angled out in the stretch
and closed full of run late to gain the show award. MIGHTY MINION was allowed to settle early and saved ground on the turn, angled out in the stretch and
had a late rally while racing green. HIGH STRIKE chased the pace on the inside and weakened. BULLITT MCQUEEN stalked the pace three to two wide on

BYK set the pace on the inside and drew clear on the turn, then drew off in the stretch smartly to prove much the best,, ridden out. SIR SMOAK was settled
early, made a four wide move on the turn but proved to be no match for the winner while staying on to be second best. BEJUCO tracked the pace on the
inside and weakened, held show award. BOOK RUNNER was slow into stride and wide, then came widest into the lane and had a belated rally to just miss
the show award. MY BLUE EYES stalked the pace three wide and weakened. UPFOR PAROLE was off slowly and failed to menace. WARRIOR'S CAUSE
broke in at the start and was not a threat. ON AN ISLAND failed to respond.

ONE MORE KELLY was reluctant to load, chased the pace moving to the inside on the backstretch, advanced on the inside on the turn and made a three
wide bid leaving the quarter pole, then drew out in the lane to prove best under mild left handed crop urging. TWEET AWAY ROBIN was away alertly and
set a fast pace while clear, then was headed leaving the three sixteenths and could not go with the winner while keeping on to be second best. MY DIXIE
LASS was reserved early, advanced on the inside on the far turn, angled out in the drive and had a no late kick. VILLAREGGIA was reserved early, came
five wide into the lane while advancing, drifted in by the furlong marker and was empty. DANCE A LITTLE JIG was void of early speed and lacked a rally.
CALL ON CLARA was void of early speed and failed to menace. MOONCHILD was settled three wide and tired.

Footnotes
ECLIPTICALS BEAR vied for the early lead three wide and went on to set the pace entering the turn, drew clear on the turn and then was kept to mild
urging to prove best. ASK THE UMPIRE was bumped at the start, settled early, then was four wide by the quarter pole and shifted to the outside and closed
well to be clearly second best. KAZTHAROS vied for the early lead on the inside, then let the winner go and stalked that rival, was trying to get out on the
turn and was between rivals on the turn, then faded and stayed on for the show award. COMMANDING chased the pace on the inside and lacked the
needed kick. VINDICATO tracked the early pace and made a milds bid four wide on the turn but weakened in the drive. D'LUCCI BOY was fractious prior to
the race, failed to menace. MISTER ARANGUIZ was not a factor.
