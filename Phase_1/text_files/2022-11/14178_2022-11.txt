LOVE ON FIRE raced wide behind the dueling leaders, advanced very wide on the turn then edged away through the final furlong. THIS ROUND'S MINE
slipped through inside to the front at the quarter pole but proved no match for the winner. STARSHIP ROGUE dropped far behind, saved ground throughout
and closed well. REITERATE pursued the pacesetter between rivals and flattened out in the stretch. JET FORCE hustled to a clear advantage and faded
after half a mile. CHARLOTTE WEBLEY trailed early racing wide and was never in contention. WORLD GONE WILD prompted the pace three wide and
was finished midway on the turn.

in gamely and weakened late. MISSION OBERON raced four wide early, then stalked three wide, chased on the far turn, raced on the rail in the stretch and

Footnotes
WONDER CITY vied inside for the lead, dueled on the backside, edged away from her pace rival on the far turn, then dropped back into the second spot,
came again in midstretch, battled back gamely inside of IFIHADACHANE, dueled with that rival to the wire and got the nod. IFIHADACHANCE was well
placed close up behind the leaders, bid three wide on the turn, took charge, drew clear, drifted out in upper stretch, dug in gamely outside of the winner in
the final sixtenth, battled heads apart and just missed. LONDONDERRY was outrun early, advanced on the far turn, rallied mildly between rivals and earned
the show spot. POSITIVE POWER raced off the pace inside, between rivals into the stretch and was outfinished for third. EMMA AND I raced off the pace,
chased on the far turn and had no rally. SUIKO raced three wide early, chased outside, chased on the far turn, swung wide and tired. LIL MISS HOTSHOT
vied outside for the lead, dueled with the winner on the backside, chased on the far turn and faded. MARIANNA QUEEN raced off the rail, off the pace and
did not factor. QUIET PLEASE was outrun. JULIET'S MUSIC tracked on the inside, then chased and gave way.
