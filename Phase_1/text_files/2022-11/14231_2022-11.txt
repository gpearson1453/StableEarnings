VANISKY tracked the solid early fractions, advanced two wide on the second turn, overtook the pacesetter nearing the top of the stretch, drew clear to the
furlong grounds and drew off while kept to task in the final stages. TAKE THE TWO TEN unhurried early on, saved ground to the second turn, advanced
nearing mid-stretch, no match for VANISKY in the late stages and kept on to secure second. INFERNAL TIGER allowed to settle, maintained position
through the backstretch run, advanced three wide on the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late rally. THECHIEFHASTRICKS hard sent leaving
the break, set solid fractions while on a clear lead to the half-mile marker, overtaken nearing the top of the lane, chased to mid-stretch and weakened.
FANTASTIC DREAM shuffled at the start and away slowly, unhurried through the backstretch run, saved ground to the top of the lane and did not factor.

Footnotes
TIJERA LEE broke sharply, assumed command of the early lead and set moderate fractions to the quarter marker, drew off in mid-stretch, geared down
while in hand in the final sixteenth. KITTEN CALLS tracked the moderate pace three wide into the turn, advanced nearing the quarter marker, could not
keep pace with TIJERA LEE in the drive and stayed on to be best of the rest. NASHIRA'S FIRE tracked the moderate pace from the inside, steadied in tight
quarters nearing the top of the lane to avoid tiring rivals, weakened in the drive and stayed on to be clear for show. SNOW HILL chased to the turn, raced
two wide to the quarter marker and did not threaten. FLAPS UP showed early speed, rank while hard to place into the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter
marker and tired in the drive. WITCHES DANCE ducked in at the start and spotted the field leaving the break, chased to the turn, lost ground three wide
nearing the quarter marker and outrun in the drive.

Footnotes
CALI CONQUEST tracked the moderate early fractions, maintained position through the backstretch run, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker,
lost ground in upper stretch, closed fast inside of the furlong marker, confronted LANGSTON ROAD in deep stretch and kept to task to get up in the final
stride. LANGSTON ROAD sent to establish the early lead, well rated through modest fractions to the second turn, drew clear nearing mid-stretch, came
under heavy pressure in deep stretch, tiring while all out and nailed on the line for the win, while holding safely for second. STRAIT OF GEORGIA forwardly
placed in the early going, made a steady advance along the backstretch run and into the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch, re-rallied in the late
stages and outfinished, while well clear for third. IMPACT ZONE became rank entering the first turn and forced out IMA CARPE DIEM, settled while not far
back through the backstretch run, rallied two wide nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain that bid in the drive and flattened out. IMA CARPE DIEM
forced out entering the first turn, tracked the pace to the half-mile marker, lost position nearing the quarter marker and did not mount a late rally. UPDRAFT
stumbled leaving the break, carried out five wide on the first turn when IMPACT ZONE became rank, settled while not far back during the backstretch run,
lost ground three wide on the second turn and lacked a late rally.

Footnotes
MOTHER'S PRAYER showed early speed, raced close to the early pace, came in tight nearing the three-quarters marker and tipped out two wide for the
run down the backside, pressed the solid fractions through the half-mile marker, confronted the pacesetter approaching the top of the lane, assumed
command in upper stretch, drew clear to the furlong grounds and drew away in the final stages. HOT JOURNEY settled in the second flight, saved ground to
the quarter marker, tipped out two wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not keep pace with the winner in the final furlong and stayed on to be
best of the rest. CONDORCAT shuffled at the start and off a bit slowly, recovered to settle off of the solid early pace, came four wide into the second turn,
slipped to the inside nearing the top of the lane, not able to threaten the top pair in the drive and passed tiring rivals in deep stretch to secure third.
HADLEES HONOR unhurried, saved ground into the backstretch run, steered three then four wide nearing the top of the lane, did not produce a late rally
and just missed show. PIPER'S CAUSEWAY broke alertly and sent to the early lead, set the pressured pace while carving out solid fractions, confronted
nearing the quarter marker, could not hold off MOTHER'S PRAYER in upper stretch, chased to the furlong grounds and faded late. BIG DIFFERENCE
stalked the solid pace from a two wide path, stayed within aim to the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.

SPANNING THE GLOBE away a step slowly, unhurried while saving all of the ground through moderate fractions, loomed in upper stretch, overtook the
pacesetter inside of the furlong marker and kicked clear in the late stages. OH ANGEL saved ground while tracking the early moderate pace, maintained
position to the second turn, lost ground nearing mid-stretch, outkicked in the final sixteenth and kept on to get up for place in the final strides. A LITTLE
GRACE sent to dictate terms in the early stages, set moderate fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, held foes at bay to the quarter marker,
felt pressure from SPANNING THE GLOBE in mid-stretch, could not hold off the winner inside of the furlong marker, weakened and edged for place, while
holding safely for show. ULTIMATE DIVA broke alertly, forwardly placed into the first turn, drifted out entering the first turn then settled into a tracking
position into the backstretch run, kept attendance to A LITTLE GRACE to the quarter marker, asked for run nearing the top of the lane and lacked a late
response. NOSHEWONT allowed to settle in the early stages, advanced to stalk the moderate pace through the backstretch run, came two wide to the
quarter marker, outrun in upper stretch and did not produce a late rally.

SUPERMAZEL assumed command leaving the break, well rated through moderate fractions to the half-mile, drew clear nearing the top of the lane and kept
to task in deep stretch to prevail. NATIONAL GENERAUX (IRE) rated off of the early pace, advanced along the backstretch run to be close up into the
second turn, could not make headway on SUPERMAZEL in the drive and held safely for second in the late stages. COUNT ASHER away a bit slowly and
allowed to settle, never far back through the backstretch turn, roused three wide nearing the top of the lane, gained ground in the final furlong, not able to
impact the top pair in deep stretch and clear for third in the end. NICKEL NICKEL NINE showed early speed, forwardly placed through the early stages,
stalked the pace to the quarter marker, outrun in upper stretch and gave way. RACKATAPTAP hard to place in the early going, came under a snug hold
through the backstretch run while not far back, saved ground while pulling into the second turn and weakened. SHANAGOLDEN raced three wide into the
first turn while in the second flight, stalked the pace through the backstretch run, lost ground leaving the second turn and tired.

Footnotes
LION'S LAIR well placed in the early stages, tracked the moderate pace from the inside to the quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch, battled with
ZAKKIYYAH to mid-stretch, found more in the final furlong and kept to task under steady urging in deep stretch to prevail. ZAKKIYYAH broke alertly and
showed good speed to dictate early terms, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, drifted out leaving the quarter marker and came three wide into the
drive, battled to mid-stretch, could not match strides with LION'S LAIR in deep stretch and just held for second in the final strides. EMILY SMILES bit slow
into stride early on, tracked the pace to the turn, advanced four wide nearing the quarter marker to vie for the lead, battled to mid-stretch, hung in the final
sixteenth and just missed for place, while well clear in the end for show. RUNAWAY PRINCESS showed early speed, pressed the moderate pace to the
turn, advanced nearing the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened. TRULY A MESS broke out at the start, spotted the field in the early
stages, lacked speed through the turn and did not factor in the drive. DADDYS NINA crowded at the break and away a step slowly, chased the moderate
pace to the turn, came three wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive and lacked a late rally.

Footnotes
HOUSE OF LORDS allowed to settle, advanced on the second turn while two wide, came in tight nearing the top of the lane, shifted in in upper stretch,
came within aim nearing the furlong marker, surged in deep stretch to overtake CHIEF JACKSON and powered home. ROCKTILLYOUDROP rated off of
the solid early fractions, roused four wide nearing the quarter marker, loomed in mid-stretch, could not match strides with HOUSE OF LORDS in the late
stages and up for place in the final strides. CHIEF JACKSON came three wide into the first turn while settling in the second flight, advanced nearing the
half-mile marker and tracked the pace to the second turn, assumed command leaving the quarter marker, came three wide into the drive, all out nearing the
sixteenth-marker, could not hold off HOUSE OF LORDS in the final stages and just edged for place in the final strides. SUMO bobbled at the break and
away slowly, unhurried in the early stages, roused four wide nearing the quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive, advanced nearing mid-stretch and
closed willingly in the final sixteenth. ALLABOUTTHEMONEY settled in the second flight, raced three then four wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly to
mid-stretch and found his best stride late. NUESTRO ENGREIDO showed early speed and assumed command along the first turn, set quick fractions
through the backstretch run, drew clear nearing the second turn, confronted nearing the quarter marker, overtaken by CHIEF JACKSON leaving the far turn,
battled to mid-stretch and gave way. LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH broke alertly and led the field into the first turn, ceded the lead into the backstretch run and
stalked the pace to the second turn, lost ground nearing the top of the lane, came three wide for the drive and faded in the final stages. BROOKYS TAPIT
tracked the quick early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain that bid
in the drive and flattened out. PEPPERMAN slow into early stride, unhurried through the backstretch run, steered four wide into the stretch and did not
factor. OH GREAT (IRE) tracked the rapid early pace from the inside, never far back through the half-mile marker, dropped back on the second turn and
tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
SAXON SAGA broke well and pressed ZHIVAGO from the start, finally gained the upper hand passing the sixteenth pole and edged away in the final yards.
ZHIVAGO came out of the gate awkwardly and veered out, forcing DOS VICIOS to take up, recovered quickly, seized the lead and the inside position of an
early pace battle with a pair to his outside, kept a short lead through the the turn, was joined by SAXON SAGA approaching the quarter pole, went
head-to-head with that one and gave way grudgingly near the sixteenth pole and held place in the end. RACER REX last away, settled into stride while well
behind the early pace, saved ground while making steady forward progress through the turn, ran on well enough to gain third. SUGAR SHANE broke
sharply and was on the outside of three-horses contesting the early pace, dropped back a bit while under a snug hold, then let loose near the quarter pole
but failed to sustain a rally while racing on the wrong lead down the stretch. SLIGHTLY DIRTY broke in a bit brushing with EYESA SPECIAL, lost some
ground and was hard ridden to get into contention, dropped to the rail through the turn, finished well enough but was not a threat to the top pair. EYESA
SPECIAL broke smartly, was not fast enough to contend the early pace but tracked three-wide from well behind the dueling trio up front, came under heavy
pressure passing the five-sixteenths pole swung out into the four path in the stretch and finished evenly to the wire. DOS VICIOS took up after the break
when ZHIVAGO came into his path, dropped to last, was being ridden from the start and still lost contact with the field by the turn, kept to task and managed
to pass one in the end. MR BIG DEAL squeezed after the break when DOS VICIOUS was forced into his path, was under a ride from the five furlong marker
but was unable to make up any ground.
