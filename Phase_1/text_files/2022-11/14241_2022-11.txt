Footnotes
SHANGHAI SUPERFLY sped to the front inside, widened in the stretch, remained clear and lasted driving. ZAEVION saved ground early, angled wide after
the quarter and closed well too late. LITTLE HARBOUR chased wide off the leaders and continued well while no threat. LONG TERM THINKING forced the
pace three then two wide and flattened out in the stretch. MAY WE ALL saved ground close up then yielded in the final furlong. EXCURSION trailed far
behind then passed rivals without menacing. SAPONARA raced along the inside and lacked a response. CAPTAIN CHAZZ prompted the winner down the
backstretch, moved inside on the turn and faded. KATE'S GOLDEN DUDE raced four wide and stopped abruptly. PER RULING #23029PP FROM THE
PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, LONG TERM THINKING WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 4th TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
JARLIAN vied inside for the lead, shook free on the turn, responded when roused, drew away and was kept to the task. PATEGORY ONE stalked the pace
early on, chased on the turn, rallied outside in the stretch run and was along for the place spot. GUSHING OIL raced off the pace between rivals, advanced
inside on the turn, rallied mildly inside in the stretch and got up for third at the wire. SCOTCH ROCK'S vied outside for the lead, chased on the turn,
weakened and lost third at the wire. LOAD UP MOE was outrun early and closed belatedly inside. DRONE SWARM raced off the pace, off the rail, came
three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. RONIN WARRIOR raced off the pace inside and did not factor. DEFIBRILLATOR raced three wide off the pace,
went four wide on the turn and gave way.

remained clear to the final furlong but weakened. GLACIER EXPRESS squeezed back early, trailed then closed well through the stretch. AMOUNT dropped
far behind racing wide then passed rivals while no threat. BOURBON MISSION prompted the pace outside for half a mile and faltered. SOMEBODY raced
wide while put to urging early and weakened steadily. CAPE MAY STYLE lacked speed and raced far behind throughout. THEY SHOT SONNY prompted
the leader three wide down the backstretch and stopped on the turn.

FINE ONE WON moved clear on the first turn then shook loose with a long advantage while kept to her task. OBSTINATE stalked the winner outside then
continued well while no match for the winner. MISS LOYALTY far behind early, swung extremely wide into the stretch rallying. MADAME ROUGE broke
sluggishly, moved off the pace in the two path and was no threat. GINGERS WISH saved ground within striking range and gave way. LULA'S
ROADRUNNER lacked speed along the rail and was never in contention. MISS DILLINGHAM in tight into the first turn, raced three wide and faded. FED
POLICY chased four wide down the backstretch and gave way. CHARITY STRIPE dropped far behind and trailed throughout.

AMERICAN PYRAMID stumbled at the start, raced three wide off the pace, moved up three wide on the turn, rallied outside, closed steadily in the final
furlong and wore down the leader to prevail. LASSIE'S NOTION vied two wide for the lead, shook clear on the turn, responded when roused, dug in gamely
in the stretch drive and yielded grudgingly late. MEMENTO MI chased on the inside, came two wide into the lane, rallied mildly outside and was gaining late.
KISSES FOR EMILY was bumped at the start, raced off the rail, off the pace and imrpoved her position. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS raced off the pace inside
and failed to threaten. TASHA chased between rivals and tired. STRAWBERRY POINT steadied after the start, raced off the pace between rivals, angled
out entering the stretch and lacked a rally. PROSPECTIVE CANDY vied inside for command, chased on the turn and gave way.

CASTILLEJA rushed up inside to duel, shook loose in the stretch, drew away and lasted. OUR UPTOWN GIRL settled behind wall of dueling leaders,
swung wide in the stretch and rallied. HIDDEN CACHE vied in the two path between rivals, steadied near the top of the stretch and weakened holding the
show. ARUMA advanced four wide on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. ARGENTINA GIRL dropped back into the far turn, moved wide and was no
threat. XENATOWN prompted the pace wide down the backstretch and gave way. QPIDSCARIZMATKQTEE saved ground off the pace and stopped
abruptly. DARLING DONNA stumbled badly start unseating her rider at the start, returned lame and was vanned off. A claim of foul by the third finisher
against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

Footnotes
CAJUN COUSIN stalked the leaders, advanced on the turn, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied outside, ran past VALUABLE BREIGH and drew off
under urging. FRAME THIS raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the turn, came two wide into the lane, rallied between rivals, finished well and got
up late for second. VALUABLE BREIGH set the pace on the inside, shook free on the turn, dug in gamely in upper stretch, was no match for the winner,
weakened late and lost second. QUEEN CORDELIA raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn and rallied mildly. SO SWELL steadied at the start,
raced off the rail, off the pace, came six wide into the lane and closed belatedly outside. THE BIGGEST ONE showed good early speed outside, chased
three wide on the turn and tired. RISEN CHANGE raced off the pace between rivals, moved up four wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane and
passed tired rivals. MISS ALEX raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. SEA PINES chased outside, chased on the turn and tired. SHEZ A
DOUBLETAKE raced three wide off the pace and failed to threaten. WITHOUT A VIEW raced three wide off the pace, three wide on the turn and did not
factor. POWWA OF LOVE raced close up inside early, then between rivals, chased on the turn and faded. I LOVE MAGEL chased outside, continued three
wide on the turn and faded. LADY BERNADETTE raced off the pace between rivals and gave way.
