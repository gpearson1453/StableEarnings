Footnotes
SIR SAHIB was situated close to the back of the pack on the rail with a half mile to run, advanced nicely while in hand through the final turn, shifted just
outside in the two path for the drive, took over in the final sixteenth and was drawing away at the finish. KEEP GRINDING tracked the top two runners in the
early stages of the race inside, slipped up the fence entering the stretch to take command, was headed by the winner outside nearing the sixteenth pole and
could not match strides running to the wire. LORD OF WAR settled alone midfield racing down the backside, was urged to go forward midpoint on the
second turn, rallied between rivals in the three path in mid stretch and finished well settling for a clear third in the end. NEWPORT AGENT forced the issue
outside into the first turn, continued to hound the frontrunner at the half, pounced to the lead three wide with two furlongs remaining and stalled a touch at
the top of the lane finishing evenly for a minor share. CRUDEN BAY tracked just off the fence mid pack in the beginning, rated kindly keeping the leaders in
sight at the half mile marker, put in a mild run outside at the top of the stretch five wide to contend and levelled off at the furlong marker. BUTTERED
TOAST was unhurried in the early stages to trail the field racing inside, was asked for more run on the fence two furlongs to the line and showed some
energy to pass tiring rivals late. WHO SAYS settled near the back just outside entering the backstretch, was roused three furlongs to the finish, could not
close the gap on the leaders and made little impression on the drive to the line. INFAMOUS COVERT brushed the gate on the start, recovered inside to lead
through the first turn, continued to set the pace entering the pace through the far turn, was surrounded by challengers on either side giving way at the
quarter pole and stopped in mid stretch.

Footnotes
U S ARMY CORPS settled mid-division inside, advanced some on the turn, moved out six wide leaving that bend, took aim, was carried out by the drifting
leader and got past that one late. MR CROWLEY moved clear to set the early tempo racing just off the rail, was pressured at the nine-sixteenths, edged
away again into the turn, drifted out badly in the stretch and was caught. EXECUTIVE SEARCH was urged strongly at the break to gain forward position,
moved up to press from between runners three wide after the opening quarter, lost ground on the leader into the turn, drifted out a bit in late stretch, was no
match for the top pair but kept on to hold show honors. ANALYZER stalked the pace from outside, went three to four wide on the turn, ran on evenly and
held the minor award from HONEY WON'T, who raced outside the eventual winner settling mid-pack, moved with that one on the turn coming seven wide
into the stretch, ran on but needed more. MR. DAZZLE raced toward the back near the inside and went evenly. WENJACK raced last but one early off the
inside in about the two to four path throughout, ran evenly. DOT'S VISION moved out racing a few paths off the rail through the turn, swung six wide and
was never near enough to threaten. SEA SCOUT broke a step slowly, made a mild advance three to four wide, tired. BOCELLI trailed and was never a
factor.

Footnotes
FIRST EMPIRE broke sharp to be in front early, was unchallenged up front to open up entering the turn, disposed of a mild outside challenge at the quarter
pole and had more than enough in reserve to draw away late for an uncontested front running victory. CASH DIVIDEND was allowed to settle early trailing
the field down the backstretch, waited patiently inside running on the turn, closed between runners three wide splitting horses at the furlong marker and
finished up well to be a non threatening second best. CLEAR DESTINATION tracked mid pack on the fence at the half, had to wait inside three furlongs to
the finish, shuffled back some running on the turn, rallied four wide at the top of the stretch and closed offering a good effort to be third. SIR SEAMUS
chased on the rail leaving the chute, was taken back off the frontrunner at the half to track outside, roused on the inside at the quarter pole and offered a
mild finish to be involved for the minors at the wire. DAY TRIPPER stalked near the back two wide down the backstretch, was ridden hard to keep up
midpoint on the turn outside of rivals, little response was given and was not involved racing to the finish line. MACLEAN'S POSSE was in a good position
tracking behind the early pacesetters at the half, took closer order just outside entering the turn, made a brief bid two furlongs remaining and tired between
horses at the eighth pole.

Footnotes
CITRUS BOY attended the pace while racing very wide early, moved to force the issue after the opening quarter and was clear a sixteenth later, widened in
the stretch while being kept to the task. BE LIKE CLINT settled off the pace near inside, shifted out about the five-sixteenths, was five wide at the top of the
stretch, gained the place but did not threaten the winner. HIDDEN HONOR lacked early speed despite encouragement from the break, moved near the rail
and advanced inside late up the backstretch and on the turn, began to shift out leaving that bend, was six wide in upper stretch, evened out while securing
show honors. SILVER SMOKE set the early pace for the opening quarter while off the rail, was overtaken and chased near the inside on the turn, kept on for
the minor award over. SOUPER RUSH , who settled into stride just off the leading pair, switched out into the turn, went three wide on that bend, loomed a
threat turning for home but faltered and faded. WHERE'S NEAL moved out from four to seven wide on the turn, came into upper stretch eight deep, ran on
evenly. BIG BAD BEAST raced off the inside and off the leaders, came into the stretch seven wide, shifted in at that juncture, failed to rally. FORESTER
HUMOR was a bit fractious in the gate, broke a step slowly, failed to threaten while racing off the inside. CLASSY WHISPER chased from mid-pack about
three wide, dropped back and faded. GIANT WATERS refused to break. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN.

Footnotes
ARMSTRONG broke in to begin, dictated the pace down the backstretch, put away the chasing rival on the turn, opened up in mid stretch and had just
enough left to hold off a fast closing challenger at the wire. STANLEY HOUSE raced a little green four wide at the half mile marker outside, began to get
interested circling runners three wide three eighths from the finish line, angled out five wide for the drive and found his best stride late to make it close in the
end. KINETIC STONE broke inwards at the start, had a good position into the turn watching the top two runners contesting for the lead, rallied inside at the
quarter pole angling out three wide for the drive and raced evenly the last eighth holding on for the show. TOWN'S WARRIOR made a good ground saving
move to get on the rail from the outside at the half, advanced nicely up the fence through the turn, shifted out three wide at the quarter marker and stalled in
mid stretch having to settle on the fringes. YORKVILLE was off slowly at the break, travelled near the back of the pack in the early stages, was asked for run
midpoint on the turn and passed tired runners in the stretch. RESTORING ORDER was slow into stride racing on the rail at the start, trailed the pack
running down the backside, urged for more at the top of the lane and could not get involved in the stretch drive. MIDNIGHT TEMPESTA pressed the pace
outside early on, chased the winner on the turn, gave way five sixteenths to the wire and retreated in upper stretch. FIELD HOCKEY settled in mid pack
outside in the beginning, lost ground to the field racing on the far turn and was not persevered with travelling to the finish.

Footnotes
ELEKTRONIC was quick to the lead and clear to dictate terms, drifted out a bit leaving the turn and put to urging, held rivals at bay while being kept to the
task. AIM FOR THE SKY broke outwardly but on top, was thereupon overtaken and raced off the leaders outside going four to five wide on the turn and
about nine deep turning for home, kept on late and just got the place over SANDY BAY, who altered inside the aforementioned at the start, raced about two
to three deep through the turn, rallied from between rivals late to just miss second. FEELTHEBEAT settled just off the pace inside, saved ground on the
turn, came out five to six wide turning for home, loomed a threat but evened out. HILARIOUS AFFAIR broke a half step slowly, advanced early three to four
wide into the turn, floated six to seven wide turning for home and within range, evened out late. GHOUL (BRZ) chased the leader two to three wide on the
turn, lacked the needed late kick. BROWNING ISLAND bumped with a rival and steadied at the start, shifted in, trailed and was never a threat. TYCOON
was bumped at the start, raced off the inside toward the rear, was never a threat.

Footnotes
VELOCITOR broke sharp to clear the field to lead on the rail entering the first turn, set the pace running down the backstretch, continued to lead up front on
the far turn, opened up on the field in upper stretch and had just enough in reserve late to hold off the closing challenge at the finish. TWIN CITY was in a
good stalking position on the rail in the third flight with a half mile remaining, waited inside on the far turn, looked for a clear path in upper stretch, weaved in
and out of traffic to finally have clear run a sixteenth to the wire and closed boldly to just miss. PHILIP MY DEAR advanced around runners five wide to track
the leaders in third by the time they entered the backside, was coaxed to go on three wide three eighths to the line, loomed four wide in upper stretch and
battled gamely to the wire just missing the place award in the end. J'ADORO bobbled briefly at the seven eighths pole to begin, travelled in the middle of the
field inside at the half mile marker, commenced his run on the rail midpoint on the far turn, split horses at the furlong pole four wide and closed determinedly
to get a small share in the end. GREYSTONE stalked five wide outside entering the backside, advanced outside rivals running to the far turn, was hard
ridden three wide three furlongs to the wire, angled out six wide while in contention for the finish and ran on with purpose outside just missing out for a minor
share. BATTLE STRIKE tracked the leader four wide into the first turn, continued the hound the frontrunner throughout until the top of the lane, was asked
for more run in upper stretch, could not gain on the winner and stalled between foes at the furlong marker. DREAM JEREEM was headstrong on the fence
entering the first turn and appeared to have clipped heels, recovered on the backstretch to advance up the rail at the half, while inside was shuffled back
some on the far turn and finished up inside full of run showing good energy late. STAYHONOR GOODSIDE was in a good spot behind the frontrunning
winner throughout , was ridden to keep pace two furlongs to the finish, battled inside mid stretch for a share of the prize and tired the last sixteenth losing
many positions. TWOWAYCROSSING settled in the middle of the pack racing on the far turn, was asked with five sixteenths to go, angled out four wide at
the top of the lane, tired to lay in even when urged left handed and raced on the wrong lead to the wire. COOL KISS reared up at the break to be last early,
steadied throughout the first turn, was in tight five sixteenths left to run and could not recover to be a threat racing down the stretch. GRAN SPIRITED
tracked two wide between rivals keeping close range to the leaders with a half remaining, was in the mix for a share at the quarter pole with foes on either
side and gave way in the final sixteeth. SAMMY STONE trailed the field down the backstretch, could never get involved and passed tiring runners through
the lane. LOOKINASSAH stalked in mid pack four wide in the early stages, was urged three furlongs to the finish, offered little response and was not a
factor running down the stretch. RENEGADE SERENADE settled near the back five wide into the first turn, continued to be at the back of the field at the
half, was ridden four wide on the final turn and was empty in upper stretch.

Footnotes
WHO'S THE STAR got away slowly and angled in unhurriedly bringing up the rear, saved ground through both turns, came out six wide gradually through
upper stretch, still had much to do by mid-stretch but once clear unleashed a strong rally to drive by late. WAR BOMBER (IRE) was forwardly-positioned
stalking two to three wide in the second flight, moved out five wide turning for home, struck the lead a sixteenth out, was outfinished but second best. NOVO
SOL (BRZ) settled off the leaders, saved some ground near the inside, began to move out on the far turn coming to the quarter pole about three deep then
six wide at the top of the stretch brushing an outside rival in the process, kicked on to get up for show. TREASON stalked four then three wide on the first
turn, moved to the lead at the five- and one-half to dictate terms from off the inside, led till late stretch but had no extra and lost show honors in a nod at the
wire. HARLAN ESTATE was just a bit rank into the first turn, saved ground inside on that bend just off the leaders, moved out two to three deep turning for
home and ran on evenly. FROSTED OVER settled off the pace inside a rival early, moved out into the far turn going from three to five wide on that bend and
advancing outside foes, came into upper stretch eight deep and went evenly. RIPTIDE ROCK settled outside off the pace, swung out widest on the far turn
coming nine deep into upper stretch and needed more. MIGHTY HEART set the early pace inside just off the rail, continued to pursue from inside on or just
off the rail but turned up empty in the stretch. MONEY PRINTER was forwardly-positioned outside three to four wide early, continued three to four deep on
the far turn coming out a bit further for the drive then getting brushed outward a bit at that juncture, faded thereafter. ARTIE'S STORM raced outside a foe,
went four to five wide on the far turn, failed to rally.

Footnotes
SO SUAVE (IRE) tracked the loose frontrunner racing down the backside, began to reel in the leader three furlongs to the wire, assumed command at the
top of the lane and kept to the task in deep stretch to win comfortably in the end. DESOLATOR travelled on the rail near the back under a good hold in the
beginning stages, shifted just outside two wide midpoint on the second turn to commence his rally, angled out in the four path turning for home, loomed
boldly in mid stretch and needed a bit more late to threaten for the win at the finish. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) showed early speed to clear runners for the lead
on the rail into the first turn, opened up considerably on his challengers at the half mile marker, was collared three sixteenths from home giving way to the
winner but battled on stubbornly inside and held for show award at the wire. GREEN FLEET broke inwards at the start, raced between rivals mid pack on
the first turn, tracked just outside rivals at the half, rallied three wide two furlongs from the finish, lost his path at the eighth pole and stalled the final sixteenth
to settle for a minor role. EMBRACE MY UNCLE was squeezed at the start trailing in the early stages of the race, continued to see them all turning for home
and finished with good interest to run by weakening rivals in the stretch. TIMESKIP stalked three wide outside rivals on the first turn, could not gain on the
field running down the backstretch, was urged two wide on the far turn and had nothing to give in the stretch run. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS settled on the rail
mid pack down the backside, was asked for more run inside three furlongs from home, had little response through the turn and retreated on the rail at the
furlong marker. FINALIST broke outwards on the start, settled near the rear running down the backstretch, was ridden to keep up five sixteenths to the line
and could not make an impact running to the wire.

Footnotes
BODIE settled into stride racing off the inside, went three wide then moved out four deep on the turn, bid nearing the sixteenth pole, dueled outside a foe
late, lugged in a bit and prevailed under steady handling. TWO YEAR CONTRACT tracked from inside, came out two to three wide turning for home, drifted
out a tad in mid-stretch, bid at the sixteenth pole inside the aforementioned, dueled with that one but was outfinished. FORITTABLE contested the early
pace, took the lead while being pressured from outside, was outkicked. MIDNIGHT SAINT was unhurried early, swung eight wide, kicked on too late.
THREE MILE LIMIT pressed the pace from outside four wide, had no extra for the drive. ALPHA BETA GAMA was in just a bit tight in the early going, raced
mid-pack three to four wide on the turn, came out a bit past the sixteenth pole and ran on evenly. DOC FISHMAN was outpaced racing near inside, asked
for more at the five-sixteenths, came out some into upper stretch, ran on. DOMINANT DESTROYER raced about mid-pack four to five wide on the turn, was
encouraged along but failed to rally and put in tight quarters past the sixteenth pole while weakening. WIN THE DRAW was toward the back four wide into
the turn, moved out seven wide turning for home, was never near enough to threaten. VELOCITO raced toward the rear off the rail and made no impact.
FREE CAT pressed the pace two to three wide, came up empty.
