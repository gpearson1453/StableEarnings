Footnotes
JUSTA SWINGING tracked the leaders from off the rail to the final turn then moved between horses to take the lead in upper stretch and drew off.
FRIENDOFTHECOURT went to the early lead from the inside, came again in upper stretch but was no match for the winner. TEMPRANO pressed the pace
from two wide then took brief lead to upper stretch and weakened. OAK HILL SOLUTION vied for the lead from the three path around the final turn but
lacked the late response. TUNE MY GUITAR saved ground to no avail. SOURNOIS was forwardly placed from four wide through the final turn and gave
way. BASSETT was unhurried and failed to menace. ITS A CITY DAY raced near the back but was never a threat. DUTCHMAN raced in the middle of the
pack and faded.

the first turn then made a rail bid on the backstretch, moved between horses in upper stretch to prove second best. MISS WOW WOW stalked the pace
around the first turn then made a three wide bid on the backstretch and finished evenly. LES AND MADGE was allowed to settle around the first turn then
made a three wide rally but was not enough. T J'S SUNSHINE sprinted to a clear lead for a half and tired. PEPPER POINT raced in the middle of the pack
for the first half and improved her position in the stretch. MAVE RUNNER stalked the pace from the two path but failed to menace. TALE OF TENSAS was
through early. CABO SUNSET was unhurried and not a factor. SEVEN COME ELEVEN showed little.

clear. SECULAR STAGNATION raced in the middle of the pack from the inside through the final turn, moved between horses in upper stretch to be a game
second. TAKEN BACK was allowed to settled far back around the first turn then started to circle the field on the backstretch and was up for the show.
FALCON HEAVY was in the middle of the pack from two wide, made a mild rail bid on the final turn and finished evenly. BOLD MINISTER went to the clear
lead from the inside holding position to upper stretch and tired. MR B QUIET was never a threat. PRAIRIE SQUALL was forwardly placed for a half and

Footnotes
LIFE OF SATURDAYS went to the front to lead throughout from the inside and just lasted. CATCAKE raced in the middle of the pack from the inside, made
a rail bid on the final turn then moved out to the two path in upper stretch, drifted out but wasn't able to catch the winner. SIENNA BREEZE saved ground
around the first turn and down the backstretch then angled out on the final turn to make a bid but tired in the drive. CYCLONE SORORITY tracked the
leader from the two path to upper stretch and weakened. DIAMOND INDY SKIES was four wide into the first turn settled in mid pack down the backstretch
then made a three wide bid into the final turn and faltered. INAWIC was through early. FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS trailed throughout.

Footnotes
PLATINUM EQUITY pressed the pace from two wide to the final turn then took command at the three sixteenths pole and drew off. FLASHING
ANGELBABY had a pressured lead from the inside through the final turn and fought gamely to the wire. WILSON TO LOCKETT tracked the leaders from
the inside and was best of the rest. COOL CATOMINE raced in the middle of the pace made a mild bid in the stretch and improved position. SUMMER
APPEAL stalked the pace from the two path while racing evenly. LATE NITE MISCHIEF saved ground to the final turn and passed tired ones. KING FORD
was forwardly placed while racing three wide through the final turn and gave way. HOLDING FAST was in the middle of the pack racing four wide but was
not a factor. SR. CLARKY was never a threat.
