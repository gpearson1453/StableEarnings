Footnotes
WEEGEE settled off the top pair on the inside then moved to the two path, closed in around the far turn and swung four wide into the stretch, reached the
front outside the eight pole and won going away. SPIRIT MAKER pressed the pace from outside to the far turn, dueled and took over past the quarter pole,
could not offer much resistance to WEEGEE in upper stretch, then stayed on to hold the place. BEE CATCHER pulled and tossed his head early while
stalking the pace, settled into stride outside a rival, came three wide into the lane, kept within striking range to the eight pole but could not find more late.
STOTLAND set the pace on the inside while pressured by SPIRIT MAKER, dueled with that rival into and around the far turn, lost the lead past the quarter
pole, fought to the eighth pole and weakened inside. FORT MOULTRIE sat off the pace in the two path, tipped three wide leaving the far turn, angled out
further in the drive but failed to threaten. OCULUS steadied and became rank briefly along the inside early, stalked the top pair inside a rival to the far turn,
saved ground then tipped out exiting the bend and flattened out. BENDER was unhurried in the beginning and moved inside, saved ground to the stretch
and was always outrun.

Footnotes
TALKATIVE GAL was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, bid three wide into the lane, headed BONITA LEONA at the eight pole, took over shortly after
and drew clear. WILD ARCH stalked the pace on the inside, asked around the turn, chased the top pair near the fence through the lane and got up for
second. BONITA LEONA away quickest and set the pace clear early on, led along the inside then two wide into the stretch while receiving a challenge from
TALKATIVE GAL, resisted to the eighth pole then lost the advantage and was edged for the place honors. SPRING SPINNING tracked two to three wide
around the bend and weakened in the stretch run. ROSES R BLUE stumbled a bit leaving the gate, steered out while trailing early, ran four wide through the
turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
COLONEL BOWMAN chased the top pair off the rail into the turn, bid three deep with a quarter mile left to run, took over at the top of the stretch, put away
inside pair past the eighth pole and held safely while drifting to the inside. MISTER BOLD dropped back off the pace, steered down to the inside nearing the
turn, tipped out leaving the bend and closed well to earn the place. ALL EYES WEST raced up close outside the pacesetter, lost touch and chased around
the bend before re-engaging between rivals past the quarter pole, failed to sustain the challenge nearing the eight pole but kept on to earn the show.
OCTOPUS set the pace inside ALL EYES WEST up the backstretch, cleared that rival on the turn then was challenged late on the turn, lost command at the
top of the stretch and flattened inside. SELF TAUGHT tracked the speed off the inside, traveled three wide through the turn and failed to rally. SENOR
JOBIM threw his head and broke in the air while the assistant starter had a hold then came out leaving the gate, trailed up the backstretch, took the turn four
wide and was not a factor. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE START OF SENOR JOBIM AND RULED THAT HE WAS NOT
AWARDED A FAIR START AND IS DECLARED A NON-STARTER.

Footnotes
NEWGRANGE took control early and set the pace inside IMPOSSIBLE TASK into the backstretch, cleared that rival at the nine-sixteenths pole, asked right
handed into the stretch and powered away. TRIPOLI got brushed by AZUL COAST into the first turn, stalked in the two path between rivals around that
bend, angled to the rail past the five-sixteenths pole, finished willingly for the place but could not make any headway on the winner. FIGURETI (CHI) stalked
three deep through both turns and was no match in the lane. IMPOSSIBLE TASK hustled from the gate and was prominent early in the three path then went
up to apply pressure from outside, lost contact at the nine-sixteenths pole and chased two wide under coaxing into the second bend, raced between foes at
the quarter pole, then weakened down the stretch. AZUL COAST brushed with outer rival while racing along the rail into the first turn, stalked up the
backstretch, got shuffled back when TRIPOLI angled in past the five-sixteenths pole, angled three wide leaving the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
GOLD COUNCIL chased outside a rival then went up inside rivals to get in range, tipped out and bumped rival when hemmed in at the quarter pole, moved
out and brushed rival in upper stretch, bid between with a furlong remaining, grabbed the lead in midstretch and drove clear. MORE TRY chased three deep
into the turn, got bumped from inside at the quarter pole while in the two path, brushed by same rival in upper stretch, bid three deep with a furlong
remaining and got outkicked by the winner. MOON ICE sped clear and showed the way up the backstretch, set all the pace to the stretch, clung to a short
lead with a furlong remaining, lost command in midstretch and flattened to third. BUCK OWENS sat off the pace, rounded the bend two wide and
summoned a mild rally to round out the superfecta. DEVIL AMONG US chased between early, lost ground and shifted to the inside on the turn, tipped out in
the stretch and finished evenly. MY RANSOM bumped leaving the gate, traveled in mid-pack three deep, came three wide into the stretch, altered out in
upper stretch, bumped rival a few times with a furlong to go, got bumped by same rival near the sixteenth pole and could not regain momentum. STAR
PROSPECT bobbled shortly after the start, sat off the pace in the early going, went two wide into the turn, steered out and came four wide into the stretch,
got bumped twice by MY RANSOM at the eight pole, drifted in and bumped that rival in deep stretch and could not rally. RHYTHEM ON STAGE raced in
range five deep to the turn, chased three deep into the lane, bid four deep at the eighth pole and weakened. WORKDAY tracked on the inside and never
produced a bid. THE LAST ONE PERK was off a bit slow in the beginning, traveled a bit off the rail through the turn and was not a factor. CHAOKOON
broke in and bumped rival, chased four deep into the turn, went three to four wide into the lane, got forced out near the eight pole and weakened. GLASS
BEACH was off a bit slow and shifted ground in the beginning, trailed on the inside then moved out into the turn, went two then three wide around the bend
and was outrun.

Footnotes
LOUD LOUD MUSIC took control early and set the pace in the two path, opened up around the far turn, continued two wide into the lane and widened
without ever having to be asked. JAMMINJL broke out a bit then settled inside, traveled in mid-pack early on, moved off the rail and split foes at the quarter
pole and bested the rest. REMEMBER SUE tracked off the rail, pressed on through the far turn and traveled three deep at the quarter pole, could not make
any impact in the lane but held the show. CHAO MAR raced two wide near the back into the first turn then got floated out a touch by inner rival on the first
turn, drifted out near the five-eights pole, went three wide into the far turn, raced two wide into the drive, moved out in the lane and passed tired foes. HOT
ON THE TRAIL stalked two wide then moved inside on the first turn, was closest in pursuit on the far turn then flattened in the stretch run. SUGAR KISSES
was off slow to begin, moved to the inside while trailing early, started to drift and steadied on the first turn, moved out on the second bend and came four
wide into the lane and failed to menace. SECRET MANEUVER stalked three wide around the first turn outside a rival, traveled two wide then angled inside
a rival down to the rail on the far turn and weakened.

TOO BOSSY cleared and crossed over to the inside, showed the way on the inside into the stretch and remained clear under right handed urging.
KATERINI stalked on the inside, a bit off the rail into the drive, chased willingly through the drive but had to settle for second best. DEAR BEAU (IRE)
tracked on the inside out of range into the turn, saved ground then moved out in the lane and kept on for a clear third. JERUSALEMA (IRE) settled on the
inside, advanced through the turn from the rail but failed to threaten in the stretch run. VERY SCARY stalked three deep early, two wide outside a rival on
the turn and weakened. MY YVONNE stalked between foes early, became rank and dropped back around the bend, then faded in the drive. AMERICAN
CONQUEST chased outside a rival out of range, steadied behind MY YVONNE and altered out to the three path around the bend, continued off the rail into
the drive and lacked a rally. BOSSY PEGASUS raced between rivals near the back into the turn, entered the lane two wide and could not respond when
needed. LOVE GONE WILD brushed the gate and came away slow, traveled three deep near the back into the turn, came three wide into the stretch and
failed to respond. CHAMPESSA was off slow to start, checked hard off heels early, trailed into the turn, saved ground to the lane and was not a factor.

LANE WAY vied between rivals early then dueled outside a rival around the turn, cleared into the stretch, showed the way into the final sixteenth and held
gamely over the runner-up. LINCOLN HAWK (IRE) settled on the inside, angled out in upper stretch, surged between runners late but ran out of time. TURN
ON THE JETS (IRE) broke in and bumped rival, went up to press the pace three deep then dropped back a bit to stalk the top pair, went three wide around
the bend, pursued the winner from outside down the lane but lacked the needed final kick. COMMANDER (FR) settled early, traveled two wide then three
wide into the lane, steered out and needed to find more in deep stretch. MESUT took a bump from outside at the start, traveled in the two path around the
turn and moved into range, set down for the drive but faltered in the late stages. RED FLAG traveled four wide at the back into the turn, got forced six wide
crossing the dirt and could not rally. MARGOT'S BOY stalked outside a rival, went three wide on the turn, moved out then got intimidated by rival who came
out a bit and shifted five wide crossing the dirt, lacked the needed response entering the final furlong and was not persevered with late. ARKAAN vied inside
a pair of rivals then dueled along the rail around the turn, jumped the track crossing surfaces and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
SQUARE CAT stalked on the inside into the turn, entered the lane two wide, tipped to the outside and drew alongside the leader in midstretch, drifted out a
bit but was quickly corrected and drove clear. IN VRONSKY STYLE dueled for the lead from outside, carried a short lead into the stretch, cleared briefly but
was soon challenged by SQUARE CAT midstretch and could not fence off the winner. SINGLE ME OUT stalked between then outside a rival on the turn,
came three wide into the stretch and edged BRIX for third. BRIX turned his head at the start to come away a bit slow, raced in mid-pack on the inside early
then moved closer into and around the bend, steered out in the lane and got outkicked for the show honors. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL went up to battle IN
VRONSKY STYLE for command from inside, fought into and around the turn, failed to keep up outside the eight pole and weakened in the furlong grounds.
MOOSE MITCHELL was held briefly and bumped at the start, sat off the pace in the early stages, waited around the far turn while three wide, swung out
into the stretch and while given his cue but could not threaten for the major awards. SHORTMAN was off slow and bumped leaving the gate, raced off the
rail then moved into the two path entering the turn, exited the bend three wide, went between rivals in the lane and improved position.
CIRCLEOFCHAMPIONS tracked outside a pair of rivals into the turn, went three to four wide around the bend and weakened in the stretch run. DUTCH
BUS stalked three deep into the turn, stayed off the rail into the lane and weakened. BRACE FOR IMPACT was off a bit slow and steadied at the start,
tracked from between rivals out of range, checked at the three-eighths pole and could not rally. EL DIABLO ROJO was off very slow to begin, trailed on the
inside then shifted around rival on the turn and never made an impact. ALPINE THUNDER broke a step slow, unhurried early on the inside and was not a
factor. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE START OF MOOSE MITCHELL AND RULED THAT HE WAS NOT AWARDED A FAIR
START AND IS DECLARED A NON-STARTER.
