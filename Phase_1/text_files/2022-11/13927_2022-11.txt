MISCHIEF'S MACHINE raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout, moved up on the outside around the final turn, rallied down the lane and was
going away at the end. HIGHTAIL COWBOY pressed the pace, dueled throughout, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. DALLAS
GOLD lacked early speed, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made an outside bid and got up for third. G VICTORY went to the front, dueling
with HIGHTAIL COWBOY, saved ground and faded down the final stretch. SILENT POWER had an awkward start, racing in the rear, passed tired ones
late, but was never a threat. FULL OF GLORY raced near the middle of the pack in the beginning, faded and finished evenly. OSO NEGRO lacked early
speed, showed little and was eased to wire.

Footnotes
GATOR PROUD unhurried in the early going, moved up on the outside around the second turn, took the lead entering the home stretch, dueled to the wire
with SERAPE and prevailed for the win. SERAPE pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the stretch with GATOR PROUD, was
outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. COURTLY DOC pressed the pace, raced close throughout and proved no match for the top two. NONEYA
went to the front, drove clear and weakened. MYFRIENDSAWINNER lacked early speed and passed tired ones. SCRAPBOOK raced in the middle of the
pack and put forth an even effort. FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS void of early speed and was never a factor. MISS CHARLIE GRAS vied for the early lead and
made a steady retreat. ADEN'S RANSOM pressed the early pace and dropped back.

Footnotes
JR'S PACIFICO went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and was kept to the task. CRIMSON STORM raced near the back in the early part, moved up
on the outside around the turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. SADIE'S LIGHT lacked early speed, raced wide around the turn,
made an outside bid and was a clear third. LUCKY BREAK showed early speed, forwardly placed throughout and weakened. TARGET PRACTICE pressed
the early pace, faded and was no threat late. TRUE DEAL raced within contention, saved ground around the turn and was finished early. JUSTA BUSTER
always raced near the back, came around the turn on the outside and was never close. JEFFROW raced near the middle of the field in the early going,
dropped back and was outrun.

LUTIE MO dueled on the front end, being challenged throughout by LONESHILOHSPECIAL, pulled away down the home stretch and won under steady
urging. OUR LITTLE GIRL void of early speed, moved up, racing wide around the final turn, made a bid, proved no match for the winner, but got by a tiring

caught for second. SILVER SIREN raced near the middle of the field, came around the first turn on the outside, raced four wide around the second turn and
finished evenly. EMMAS RULER lacked early speed and passed tired ones. IRON BANNER void of early speed and was never a factor. BE A BANDIT

Footnotes
BOW BOW GIRL unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the inside around the second turn, got through on the rail entering the stretch, drove clear and
was kept to the task. PRETTI XTREME lacked early speed, moved up, within contention at the 34 pole, rallied down the stretch and finished willingly.
ONAMARGARITADAY went to the front, drove clear, was forwardly placed throughout, but lacked a late finish. IT'SFIFTYSHADETIME raced in the middle
of the field, eased back, made a late bid and was outfinished for show. KELA'S TURN pressed the early pace, weakened and was no threat late.
CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR raced evenly near the back in the early part, came around the final turn on the outside, finished wide and went to the wire evenly.
FREE LIKE A GIRL pressed the early pace, racing behind ONAMARGARITADAY in the early going, faltered around the final turn, faded and was done.
CUPERE void of early speed and showed little. HANNAH'S HAVEN raced within striking distance, dropped back and was no threat late.
