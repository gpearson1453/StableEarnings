Footnotes
JANERO ROSE was off a step slow, then moved up along the inside to set the pace, drew off during the drive and won as the rider pleased. SHOE GAME
was allowed to settle in stride early, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out to launch her bid entering the stretch, could not reach the winner but
finished well for the place. SHEZ A GRINDER was unhurried early while saving ground, slipped through along the inside on the turn to reach contention and
then went evenly late. ELEGANT CRICKET prompted the early pace while three-wide, but lacked a response when asked. IZANAMI was five-wide
throughout and finished willingly. MADISON'S QUARTERS failed to seriously threaten while racing four-wide. MY EXPRESSION was forwardly placed early
while racing three-wide, dropped back on the turn, angled in for the drive and failed to factor. REIGN OF FIRE showed early speed while racing two-wide
and then gave way. TOP HAT HIGH JINKS failed to menace while racing six-wide.

Footnotes
PALACE PRINCE saved ground stalking Moonlite Graham, angled out entering the stretch, caught that one nearing the sixteenth pole and was all out to
prevail narrowly. CLEOPATRA'S STRIKE was unhurried early, swung out to come eight-wide into the stretch and finished fast to just miss. MOONLITE
GRAHAM opened a clear lead early, saved ground setting the pace, responded when asked, but was quite good enough in a game effort.
WILLTOBELUCKY was reserved off the early pace, came three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. BOURBON TAN saved ground throughout
but lacked a rally. BLUE AZUL dropped back early while saving ground and passed tiring rivals. SIDE STREET DAVE was forwardly placed to the stretch
while three-wide and weakened. LIVING VICARIOUSLY was prominent early while racing two-wide and tired.

Footnotes
CANNONBALL COMIN vied with Jazz Town for the lead from along the outside, was carried out by that one entering the stretch, responded to pressure and
proved narrowly best in a stiff drive. MISTER MCLEAN saved ground stalking the pace, slipped through entering the stretch when Jazz Town drifted out,
offered a bold bid nearing the eighth pole but wasn't quite good enough. JAZZ TOWN dueled with Cannonball Comin from along the inside, drifted out
entering the stretch and held on gamely during the drive. FAMOUS ROCK STAR was allowed to settle in stride while racing two-wide on the turn, came
four-wide into the stretch and was gaining ground late. FRANKS FIX IT raced three-wide on the turn, angled out five-wide entering the stretch and finished
in a mild rally. SHANE ZAIN raced two-wide on the turn while between horses and lacked a rally. MINISTERSDON'TLIE dropped back early, came six-wide
into the stretch and gained his best stride too late. EL MAESTRO was prominent early racing along the inside, was in tight nearing the seven-sixteenths pole
and tired. AUTOPILOT was unhurried early, came nine-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. WARFRONT FIGHTER lacked early speed, came
eight-wide into the stretch and was not a factor.

slightly late. APART OF MY CHARM prompted the pace to the stretch and tired. RED PANTY NIGHT was forwardly placed early while racing three-wide

LOW DOSE saved ground setting the pace while racing in hand and won with something left. SWEET LADY LANA chased the winner throughout, was no
match for that one, but was clearly second best. MISYA GIRL was three-wide on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. PARTY
POLICE was four-wide on the turn, rallied six-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. SHE'S NOT TO BLAME was permitted to settle in stride, came
four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. ROSES FOR SUZZETT saved ground while being unhurried, split rivals entering the stretch but lacked a
response. SKY HIGH VERONIKA was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. AWESOME GALAXY dropped back early
and was not a factor. ROYAL DANIELLE lacked early speed and failed to menace. DISCOVER A WISH was forwardly placed early along the inside and
gave way.

FOREMAN saved ground setting the pace under pressure from Track Bound, shook that one off nearing the stretch, drifted out slightly, then came in late
and bumped with Glenroy nearing the wire and just lasted. FOR INTERFERENCE NEARING THE WIRE, FOREMAN WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST
AND PLACED SECOND. GLENROY was allowed to settle in stride early, rallied along the inside into the stretch, offered a bold bid nearing the wire, was
bumped for Forman late and finished willingly when clear then was awarded the win via disqualification. TRACK BOUND prompted the early pace from
along the outside, drifted out entering the stretch and held on for the show. ADD ON was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and finished in a
late rally. BLESSED BROTHER dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. ROUGE SUNSET saved ground while being
forwardly place, but lacked a rally. MARK OF VALOR was prominently placed early and weakened. AUTISM SAVANT failed to threaten while saving
ground. ROYAL TAP gave way after showing brief speed.

Footnotes
DAY PLAN was allowed to settle in stride while racing three-wide, angled out to be five-wide entering the stretch and finished fast to be up in the final
sixteenth and win going away. OUTSIDE THE LAW vied for the lead With Thatbeingsaid to the stretch, shook that one off nearing the eighth pole, but was
unable to resist the winner late. BLAZINGBELLABLU steadied early in tight along the inside, then was unhurried, rallied six-wide into the stretch and
finished full of run. LA CASTIGLIONE was forwardly placed racing along the inside but lacked the needed late response. ARIZONA SUN was prominent
from the start while racing three-wide, steadied briefly while in tight nearing the eighth pole and finished willingly when clear. INTERSTELLA failed to
seriously threaten while racing two-wide. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. WITH
THATBEINGSAID disputed the pace from along the outside to the stretch and tired. MISS GLORIOUS was prominent early from between horses, steadied
while in tight nearing the seven-sixteenths pole and gave way. MY FIRST PEARL was not a factor while saving ground. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED
AN INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING OF THE RACE, BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS, MAD NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.
