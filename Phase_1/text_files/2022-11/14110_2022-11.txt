Footnotes
NIGHT PROOF assumed command of the early lead leaving the break, was well rated while setting decent fractions through the backstretch run, shook free
from a pressing rival in upper stretch, was confronted by SKY DINSKI nearing the sixteenth-marker, kept to task under left-handed urging and dug in in the
final strides to prevail. SKY DINSKI tracked the pace from a three wide position into the backstretch, advanced three wide on the far turn, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, closed well in deep stretch, confronted the winner nearing the sixteenth-marker, made a late push in deep stretch but could not get by the game
winner and just missed for the win, while besting the rest. THE LONNA RANGER showed early speed, pressed the decent pace through the backstretch
run, kept close attendance to NIGHT PROOF to the quarter marker, could not match strides in upper stretch, weakened in the late stages and held safely in
the end for third. MADE THE TEAM was forwardly placed into the first turn then took back to stalk the pace into the backstretch run, chased the leaders to
the quarter marker and did not offer a late rally. TAM'S TIME settled off of the early fractions, came three wide into the backstretch run, maintained that
three wide path into the second turn and was not a late factor. DANNY MICHAEL was unhurried, saved all of the ground and did not threaten late.

Footnotes
TEAM CONCEPT showed early speed, ceded the lead along the first turn and tracked the decent fractions through the backstretch run, advanced to
challenge the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, battled with ST HELENA to mid-stretch, shook free of that rival, responded to firm urging in deep
stretch and just held over the oncoming runner-up in the final strides to prevail. THE GINGER QUEEN (IRE) settled off of the early pace while saving
ground, advanced along the second turn, waited for racing room nearing the top of the lane, angled three wide in upper stretch, ran evenly to mid-stretch,
closed well inside of the furlong marker, switched to the left lead in deep stretch, just missed for the win in the final strides and was second best. ST
HELENA broke alertly and was sent to dictate terms early on, set solid fractions through the backstretch run, was confronted by TEAM CONCEPT nearing
the quarter marker, met that bid to mid-stretch, gave way in the final stages and just held for show. ALISO BEACH was unhurried, came two then three wide
along the far turn, swung widest into the drive, mounted a late rally while five wide and just missed for third in the final strides. LOTSABLING threw her head
leaving the gate and was off a bit slowly, recovered to stalk the decent early fractions from a three wide path, advanced three then four wide nearing the top
of the lane, could not sustain that run in the drive and weakened.

Footnotes
LADY IN A HURRY was allowed to settle, raced three wide into the turn, mounted a six wide rally leaving the quarter marker, closed with a rush in the final
sixteenth, confronted her stablemate in deep stretch and determinedly prevailed in the final strides. MARY MARGARET was unhurried in the early stages,
saved ground into the turn, was steered out and roused five wide heading into the stretch, made a steady gain nearing the furlong marker, took a narrow
lead in deep stretch, matched strides with the winner in the final stages and was nipped in the final strides for the win, while clear of the rest for second. THE
ARCADIAN WAY contested the solid early pace, pressed UNCAGED KITTY to the quarter marker, lost ground to that rival in upper stretch, ran evenly in the
drive and was outkicked by the top pair, while holding for show in the final strides. UNCAGED KITTY broke alertly and showed good early speed while
disputing the pace, set quick fractions while pressed to the quarter marker, shook free and drew clear into mid-stretch, could not hold off oncoming rivals in
the late stages and faded. MISS BELLA was forwardly placed early on, tracked the quick pace three wide through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and
gave way late. PERFECTLY JULIE stalked the solid early pace, saved ground to the top of the lane and tired.

IN HONOR OF AUTISM rated off of the quick early pace, raced four wide outside of rivals on the turn, gained ground in upper stretch, drifted in a bit nearing
the sixteenth-marker, closed determinedly in deep stretch, took command in the final stages and kept to task late to hold off the runner-up. DOGE OF
VENICE was allowed to settle along the inside, improved position on the turn, loomed in upper stretch, drifted out while gaining inside of the furlong marker,
was put to steady right-handed urging in deep stretch and was outclosed by the winner in the final strides, while securing place. ZACCHEUS was hustled to
the early lead, drew to a clear advantage into the turn, set solid fractions to the quarter marker, was set down for the drive, could not hold off the top pair in
deep stretch and held safely for show in the end. JERRY JEFF WALKER tracked the early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch
and was outkicked in the final sixteenth. MISTER MIDAS was bumped leaving the start, recovered to track the quick early pace, came two wide leaving the
turn, chased the pacesetter to mid-stretch, took up and was shuffled back nearing the sixteenth-marker and weakened in the final stages. APLOMBADO
chased the early speed, saved ground to the top of the lane, swung four wide for the drive and did not offer a late rally. THERE WAS A STEWARDS
INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INVOLVING MISTER MIDAS NEARING THE SIXTEENTH-MARKER AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION THE
STEWARDS RULED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
SPROSTON was asked to show early speed leaving the break, assumed command along the first turn then was well handled through moderate fractions to
the half-mile marker, set a pressured pace to the top of the lane, shook free from the pressing rival in upper stretch, was challenged by the runner-up in the
drive and held KOKO'S MOM at bay through the lane to prevail. KOKO'S MOM was allowed to settle, came two wide into the backstretch run, slipped to the
inside along the second turn, advanced in upper stretch, challenged the winner in the lane but could not get by the determined winner and was second best
in the end. TIGER'S ARROW stalked the early pace three wide along the first turn, maintained position through the backstretch run, advanced three wide on
the far turn, swung four wide for the drive, weakened in the final furlong but kept on to secure third. INFERNAL TIGER showed early speed and pressed the
pace along the first turn, kept close attendance to the pacesetter through the backstretch run and into the second turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch,
gave way in the final stages and was just edged for third in the final strides. PICK BYMY FRIEND settled three wide off of the early pace, was steered four
wide nearing the quarter marker and did not produce a late rally. LOOKOUT POINT was unhurried in the early going, saved all of the ground through the
backstretch run, came in tight and was shuffled back entering the second turn, made a mild late rally but was not able to threaten in deep stretch.
FANTASTIC DREAM stalked the early pace from a two wide position, dropped back on the second turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
ASANO'S BACK was a bit slow away from the gate but recovered to be not far back early on, chased two to three wide along the turn, rallied leaving the
quarter marker, advanced nearing mid-stretch, was full of run inside of the furlong marker, overtook PARTY FOUL in deep stretch and drew clear in the final
stages. PARTY FOUL broke alertly, showed good early speed to set the pace, drew clear nearing the quarter pole, kept to task to mid-stretch, was collared
by the winner inside of the sixteenth-marker and stayed on late to be second best. RESERVENOTMET settled off of the quick early pace, slipped to the
inside nearing the quarter marker, gained ground in upper stretch, lacked the needed late response and was well clear in the end for third. DR. FLASH
DANCER disputed the early pace, lost ground two then three wide on the turn and weakened in the stretch. OMMANEY BAY contested the early pace while
between rivals, chased PARTY FOUL along the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
NAN ELIZABETH raced in the second flight early on while well placed, advanced three wide on the turn, mounted a five wide rally in upper stretch, ran
evenly to the furlong grounds, closed determinedly in deep stretch, overtook the runner-up in the final stages and made a late push to prevail. KIND BUT
SHE LIES established the early lead, set solid fractions while pressed through the turn, drew clear nearing the furlong pole, could not hold off the oncoming
winner in the final sixteenth and was second best. TIZ A TIGER tracked the solid early pace from an inside position, saved ground to the quarter marker, ran
evenly to mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final stages and held safely for third in the end. MISTICAL SURPRISE took back off of the early pace, raced two
wide to the quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch, could not impact the leaders in deep stretch but was gaining in the final sixteenth. CLUBHOUSE
WAVE was fractious in the gate, showed early speed and pressed the pace through the turn, lost ground nearing mid-stretch and faded. PRECIOUS
INSIGHT up close to the early pace, stalked the solid fractions three then four wide on the turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch and gave way. BLUE
BREEZE stumbled leaving the start, chased from the rear early on, improved position four wide on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and did not threaten
late. INEXPENSIVE STAR was shuffled back at the break, lacked speed through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
JERSEY STAR broke in and bumped with LILY PAD LAKE at the break, angled towards the rail in an attempt to save some ground, was forced to race in
the four-path but was clear of traffic through the turn, was sent after the leader passing the three furlong marker and responded to steady handling through
the stretch run to prevail. DALLAS ALICE was in tight a bit after the break, moved up quickly to be in the leading group in the early stages, fell back through
the turn, came on again in the stretch but was behind horses while full of run, moved towards the inside but then lost that path and had to steady slightly at
the sixteenth pole, then moved out a path, surged through an opening and gained the place. FREED BY MAGIC was sent from the break, opened a clear
lead after a furlong, extended that lead a bit through the turn, responded when challenged on all sides in the stretch and battled gamely to the wire. LILY
PAD LAKE broke out and bumped with JERSEY STAR after the break, raced mid-pack and three to four wide down the backstretch and through the turn,
swung out into the five path turning for home and finished well despite racing on the wrong lead through most of the stretch run. AUTISM EXCELLENCE
broke in towards the gap after the break, was asked for speed along the rail, then put under a hold, taking a comfortable position behind the pacesetter,
continued to save ground through the turn while in hand, drifted out slightly entering the stretch taking the path of TOP HAT TIGRESS, was in contention to
deep stretch but weakened late. RED HARBOR broke in and crowded DALLAS ALICE at the break, lacked early speed, was a bit hard to place in the run
down the backstretch, swung out to the four-path entering the turn, swung out even wider for the stretch run but could not make up any ground. TOP HAT
TIGRESS came away from the gate in good order but was outrun early, took the rail path into the turn, was boxed through the whole of the turn, clipped
heels and lost the rider at the three-sixteenths pole and walked off under her own power. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT
INVOLVING TOP HAT TIGRESS IN UPPER STRETCH. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION THE STEWARDS RULED THAT AUTISM EXCELLENCE DRIFTED
OUT SLIGHTLY NEARING THE THREE-SIXTEENTHS MARKER, IMPEDED TOP HAT TIGRESS AND WOULD BE DISQUALIFIED FROM FIFTH AND
PLACED BEHIND TOP HAT TIGRESS DUE TO THAT INTERFERENCE.
