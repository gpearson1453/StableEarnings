vied for the early lead, dueled down the stretch, while racing inside and was outfinished. BRITE OUTLOOK raced within striking distance, made a late gain
and finished willingly. MORO OUTLAW raced in the middle of the field in the early going, made a late bid and was outfinished for third. MORO MAFIA raced

was no threat. THE FIVE B'S flashed early speed, saved ground around the turn and faded. EASY EDDIE A void of early speed and was never close.

CITY, but held on for second. OPTIMISTIC dueled on the front end, saved ground, raced close throughout and was outfinished for second. TRAELEE had a
tight start, racing in the back, moved up on the outside around the second turn, showed late interest, but was no factor. NASTY EXAGGERATOR raced
within striking distance, came around the first turn on the outside, put forth an even effort and lacked a late kick. WARRIORS HAVEN raced near the back,
came around the first turn on the outside and never mounted a rally. FUNNY ACTOR pressed the early pace and faded. OH SNAP void of early speed and
was never a threat. GENERAL EISENHOWER raced in the middle of the pack and dropped back. COACH HUDSON raced near the middle of the field in

Footnotes
BLUE CHEESE void of early speed, racing in the back, moved up on the outside around the final turn, drifted in down the stretch, made a bid and proved
the best. INTO WISHING raced near the middle of the field, had an outside trip, moved up around the second turn, steadied down the home stretch, getting
in tight quarters and was outfinished for the win. FIESTY FIST pressed the pace, had an outside trip, was forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished
by the top two. HOME VISIT raced in the middle of the field, entered the home stretch wide, steadied down the lane, getting in tight quarter, made a mild
bid, but was no factor. TOUCHDOWN JOE raced near the middle of the pack, made a mild bid, angled in down the final stretch and finished evenly inside.
DREWMAZING raced within contention, made a bid, took the lead at the head of the stretch, weakened and was no threat late. CHARLIES TICKET void of
early speed and passed tired ones. DONNIE BOY dueled on the front end, saved ground and faded. QUARTER RAT void of early speed and was never
close. GUITAR DOCTOR showed early speed and dropped back. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS CALLED INTO THE RUNNING OF THE RACE. ALSO
THE JOCKEYS OF #9 HOME VISIT AND #10 INTO WISHING LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #2 BLUE CHEESE FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE
HEAD OF THE LANE. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED #2 FROM FIRST AND PLACED HIM FOURTH.

TRIPPER JOHN challenged for the lead, drove clear, saved ground and was kept to the task. DIXIE STREET unhurried in the beginning, saved ground
around the turn, made a late rail bid, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. MUCHO MARVIN pressed the early pace, saved ground around
the turn, raced close throughout and was caught for second. YES BAB raced within contention, came around the turn on the outside and weakened. I'LL
RAISE YOU lacked early speed and was never a threat. PEPPER JACK always raced near the back and was outrun. CRUSADER EXPRESS showed early
speed and made a steady retreat.
