Footnotes
CRIMSON PRINCESS prompted the pace in the four path, bid from the three path going into the far turn, opened up at the top of the lane, and held sway.
QUEEN DEYMAR stalked in the three path, was coaxed along rounding the far turn, and ran on in the stretch for place. MEDIATION tracked in the five path,
was roused around the far turn, and kept on down the lane to get up for show. MAJOR PRYCE raced in midpack from inside, was hustled around the far
turn, shifted out to the four path into the stretch, but evened out late. BLACK ICE rated from the three path and passed tiring foes in the stretch. ACTION
ROSE pressed in the three path, led from the two path around the far turn, but gaveway going into the lane. SISTER'S DUTY chased from the six path but
flattened down the lane. BALI BALLERINA set the pace from inside but yielded going into the far turn. MISS KRISTY was always outrun.

Footnotes
BIG JOHN pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, drew clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. WINOOSKI
settled off the pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and was clearly second best. HEART BOY raced off
the early, advanced three wide around the turn, lacked the needed rally and was along for the show. GERARD bumped with DREAM OF BLESSINGS at the
start, bobbled soon after, recovered quickly to set the pace along the rail and weakened in the lane. HELLO JACK chased the pace two wide and faded after
a half. CAPT COMPLICATED had brief speed three wide. DREAM OF BLESSINGS bumped at the start, saved ground and never threatened.
SCANDALISSIMO was outrun while racing two wide.

Footnotes
BAHAMIAN MOON led while two wide early, opened up turning into the lane, and held sway. FULTON MARKET pressed from inside, floated out to the five
path going into the stretch, and ran on to hold place. STARSHIP NALA stalked in the four path, was ridden from the five path into the stretch, and kept on for
show. NIKEE KAN tracked in the five path, swung out to the six path going into the lane, but was one paced. SONAR trailed along the inside early and was
never a threat. QUINOA TIFAH chased in the two path but was empty entering the stretch.

TANK TOP stalked the pace from the rail, cut the corner into the lane, took over inside of foes leaving the three-sixteenths pole, drew clear leaving the
eighth pole and held safe under a drive. LAVEAU raced off the pace three wide, angled five wide in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and rallied
through the lane. FELINE bumped with DELTA RED at the start, stalked the pace in the four path, bid nearing the quarter pole, turned for home on near
even terms, continued on the left lead and flattened out. MIDNIGHT IN ALASKA set the pace in the two path and gave way in upper stretch. HOT FOOT
SUSIE stumbled badly then bumped MISS MCBRIDE at the start, raced four wide and never threatened. DELTA RED was bumped at the start, raced four
wide and made little impact. MITESSE dueled between foes in the three path, steadied near the quarter pole and had no further response. MISS MCBRIDE
was bumped at the start, raced two wide and never factored. HOT BOTTOM GIRL was outrun while racing five wide.

Footnotes
HOPE IN HIM led from the two path, opened up around the turn, and held that advantage. FOREST SURVIVOR prompted the pace in the three path, took
aim from the four path going into the stretch, and ran on for place. THE PREDICAMENT chased in the five path, was driven along from the six path turning
into the lane, and kept on for show. UNIFIED CONQUEST trailed from the three path early, floated out to the eight path for the stretch, and was gaining.
COOP TRIES HARDER tracked from three wide, was coaxed while shifting in to the two path around the turn, but finished evenly in the stretch. OLD TOWN
ROAD raced from off the pace in the four path, was ridden along from the eight path going into the lane, but was one paced. HANDSOME PRINCE was
held up in the three path, was roused while two wide entering the lane, but flattened. TIGER BLOOD rated in the three path but was never a threat. QUITE
READY was hustled along from inside, got steadied midway around the turn, and was tired in the stretch. CACTUS JACK raced in midpack from the two
path but backed up around the turn.

Footnotes
EYES ON THE KING stalked the pace in the three path, took over near the quarter pole and powered clear in the lane. LIVE IS LIFE raced in range three
wide, bid four wide nearing the quarter pole, was no match for the winner in the lane but stayed on to gain the place. AFY KID was bumped at the start,
trailed in the four path around the first turn, advanced three wide between foes around the far turn, swung six wide in upper stretch, bumped with BRUMBA
WAFFLE TOES near the three-sixteenths pole then again near the eighth pole, continued on the left lead and narrowly outfinished that foe for the show.
BRUMBA WAFFLE TOES saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch, bumped with AFY KID in upper stretch and again in midstretch and was
outdueled by that foe for the show. SPLENDOR BEAUTY set a clear pace in the two path and gave way near the quarter pole. WINE EMPIRE was bumped
at the start, raced two wide in midpack and faded in the lane. TIGRE chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. HARD TO HANDLE played no
factor while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
THE DISTRACTOR rated from the six path, moved up while three wide around the turn, swung back out to the six path going into the stretch, and rallied
between rivals to get up late. LEGAL DEAL chased in the five path, was hustled from four wide around the turn, drifted out to the eight path into the lane,
and ran on for place. ABSOLUTE GRIT prompted the pace from the four path, bid from the six path turning into the lane, and kept on for show. PRIVET
MOON bumped with an inner foe, led while two wide, floated out to the four path into the lane, but yielded late. SMILING TEUFLES got squeezed at the
start, trailed from the four path early and passed tired rivals in the stretch. ROUGH ENTRY bumped with an outer foe, tracked from the three path but
weakened in the stretch. SCHOCHOH pressed from inside early but gaveway around the turn.

IMPRESSIVE broke a bit awkwardly, trailed four and five for six furlongs and ran on for the show. SHORT CIRCUIT stalked the pace three wide, had aim in
upper stretch weakened through the final furlong. NANA FANNY set the pace inside of the winner and gave way in upper stretch. NO VALLA steadied
entering the first turn, saved ground in range and faded in the drive.

BALI BABY tracked in the three path, loomed four wide around the turn, bid passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. CUPID AUSTIN chased in the four
path, tucked inside around the turn, tipped out to the three path in upper stretch, and ran on to get up for place. MUGURUZA prompted the pace from three
wide, bid two wide turning into the stretch, and kept on for show. R REPOSADO LOCA led between rivals, was roused from the two path into the lane, but
yielded late. SHE'S OUTTA HERE raced from wellback in the two path, swung out to the five path into the lane, and moved up. OLYMPIC FENCER pressed
from inside early but faded in the stretch. ROUGH ENOUGH trailed into the stretch and was never a threat. RAW HONEY stalked from the two path early
but weakened through the lane.
