Footnotes
FABULOSITY cleared off early on, widened her advantage in upper stretch, and lasted safely under driving pressure. PEACEFUL MOMENT broke out and
squarely bumped a foe at the start, stalked outside of the clear leader, gave way at the half mile pole, yet sustained stride turning for home, regained place
at the three sixteenths pole, and stayed on well to prove second best. SPUNK tracked along the inside, chased the clear leader as that foe's only pursuer
around the far turn, but faded without menacing. QUEEN TAPITURE broke slowly while taking a bump from an outer rival at the start, then made little
impact along the inside. YOU'RE A DANDY received a solid bump from an inner rival at the start, then failed to factor from the four path. GAMBI hopped
and bumped an inner foe at the start while breaking slow, then laid off of the pace in the three path, and was done early.

Footnotes
SUNNY ISLE BEACH stalked two wide, bid approaching the three furlong pole, led soon after, and drove clear. A GIRL LIKE ME broke a step slowly,
moved forward to track in the three path into the turn, then stayed on while hanging on her left lead to claim place approaching the final sixteenth. SUE
ELLEN MISHKIN cleared off early on, but met the eventual winner's bid into the turn, got headed approaching the five sixteenths pole, and gave way.
AIDANIKE tracked outside of the top pair early on, chased them from the two path around the turn, but lacked a bid. PRINCESSTAPITURE also came out
about a length slow, raced at the rear three to two wide, and was outrun. LA TOURISTA lacked speed along the inside, and never got involved.

Footnotes
TUMBARUMBA set the pace three wide, then sparred with only a single inner rival while remaining in the three path around the turn, inched away from his
inner counterpart while in the five path in upper stretch, dug in to resist BABY BILLY's inner challenge leaving the furlong grounds, and held firm. BABY
BILLY brushed with an outer rival at the start, laid close up along the inside, backed off to stalk in the two path into the turn, rallied in the four path in upper
stretch to bid for the lead inside of TUMBARUMBA leaving the furlong pole, dueled through the late stages, but was denied. INSPEIGHTOFTRAINER laid
off of the pace in the three to two path, shifted out to the five path entering the lane, and stayed on to reach show in the final sixteenth. JOEY
FRESHWATER felt contact from rivals on both sides at the start, vied two wide and between horses, sustained the battle only inside of the eventual winner
around the turn, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, and weakened. ITWASTHISBIG bumped an inner foe at the start, lacked speed along the inside,
trailed turning for home, then altered course to the seven path approaching midstretch, and moved up. IRISH ACES tracked three wide, took the turn in the
four path, and yielded. BLANTON broke a beat slowly, trailed along the inside, took the turn in the three path before fanning to the six path entering the lane,
and failed to factor. SMART PRIZE tracked two wide and between horses, then faded.

TOUCH CODE was reluctant to load, then dueled along the inside, and drove clear leaving the furlong grounds. CYCLONE shied from an outer rival at the
start causing him to spot the leaders multiple lengths, recovered to stalk the embattled pair from the three path, but failed to truly progress in upper stretch,
then surpassed a tiring rival for place entering the final sixteenth while chasing the leader home. ALLO ENRY dueled for the lead two wide, but weakened
between horses at the furlong pole. WORKINFROMHOME broke out, lacked speed while taking the turn in the four path, and failed to menace. ISLAND
MISCHIEF shied severely from outer rivals at the start causing him to lean all the way into the inner railing while breaking many lengths slow, lagged behind
while taking the turn in the five path, and never got involved. MUD PUDDLE broke in while tossing his head, the briefly chased in the four to three path
before weakening around the turn.

MULBERRY STREET tracked along the inside, smoothly tipped out to take aim on the leader nearing the far turn, bid at the three furlong pole, took over
entering the lane, and drew off under driving pressure. FATHER PATRICK bumped with an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside,
shifted out turning for home, then stayed on in the seven path through the final furlong to bid for place along with an inner KISS PRINCIPAL, and prevailed
narrowly. KISS PRINCIPAL laid off of the pace three wide before shifting in entering the backstretch, moved forward nearing the far turn, chased the leading
group from the two path around that bend, shifted out to the five path and between horses in upper stretch, and stayed on to bid for place along with an
outer rival in the final sixteenth, but just missed. JACKS FIRE BALLS tracked in midpack two wide, chased three wide and between horses around the far
turn, cut the corner entering the lane sparred with a trio of outer rivals for place entering the final sixteenth, but was bested late. VASILEVSKIY (IRE) broke a
beat slowly and raced far back in the three path early on, came under coaxing five wide nearing the far turn, chased outside of foes around that bend,
shifted inwardly at the furlong grounds while vying for place, and battled for that position between horses soon after, but yielded in the final sixteenth. KING
OF STING vied for the lead along the inside, disposed of his outer counterpart before meeting the eventual winner's challenge entering the far turn, got
headed by that foe at the three furlong pole, and weakened turning for home. STORM'S REFLECTION stalked the top pair from the two to three path
around the first turn, but was floated four wide and between horses nearing the far turn, chased around that bend, but weakened coming to the furlong
grounds. T J MUNNINGS broke a step slow before bumping with an outer rival at the start, trailed along the inside, and was outrun. PRESTONSBIRD vied
three to two wide around the far turn, but weakened at the half mile pole, steadied while wilting between horses entering the far turn, and was eased through
the lane.

ONE TIME MO laid off of the pace in the four path, shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch, and rallied to drive past the leaders entering the final
sixteenth. SHADY ROAD stalked three wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, dueled before wrestling an advantage
approaching midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival at the sixteenth pole. ANKYRAH got keen between a pair of foes early on, tracked along the
inside, tipped to the four path in upper stretch, stayed on, flopped back to her left lead before bidding for show in the final sixteenth, and reached that
position narrowly at the wire. MAGICAL ACT vied inside of a rival leaving the chute, cleared with five furlongs to go, but was roused in the two path once a
pair of outer foes menaced turning for home, dueled gamely through midstretch, but yielded a sixteenth from home. LADY COMMANDER laid off of the
pace two wide while in the three path, but was very green to change leads in upper stretch, and lacked a bid. MARKSWOMAN bumped with an outer rival at
the start, vied two wide, backed off to stalk at the five furlong pole, rebid for the lead along with an outer rival at the five sixteenths pole, vied in upper
stretch, but weakened at the furlong grounds. MIDNIGHT TANGO bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked in midpack two wide, but faded along the
inside around the turn. KEEN CONTENDER trailed throughout.

PORTILLA stalked three wide, bid turning for home, shifted out to the five path entering the lane to create separation with an inner counterpart, but took a
brush from that one soon after, dueled through upper stretch, gained an advantage coming to the final furlong, and edged clear. SHE'S ALL CLASS pressed
two wide, vied into the turn, led between horses turning for home after an outer PORTILLA bid, shifted out and brushed that foe while digging in entering the
lane, sustained the duel through upper stretch, but was bested at the furlong grounds. CODE FOR SUCCESS laid off of the pace two wide while under
steady urging, took the turn in the three to four paths, shifted out to the seven path coming to midstretch, chased while staying on through the final furlong,
and reached show late. FAST AND FLIRTY tracked along the inside, retreated to trail the field entering the lane, shifted off of the fence in upper stretch, an
stayed on between horses. CANCEL THIS set the pace inside of a vying rival, got headed whilst inside of a pair of foes turning for home, and yielded in
upper stretch. IN MY OPINION trailed three wide, took the turn in the four to five path, and made little impact.

Footnotes
CHARLIE'S PENNY bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the three to four path, ranged up turning for home, took aim on a game
LOVEMESOMEME in upper stretch, bid at the furlong grounds, dueled before forging an advantage entering the final sixteenth, and edged clear.
LOVEMESOMEME set the pace inside of a pair of vying rivals, got headed by her furthermost foe turning for home, gamely regained an advantage in upper
stretch as a wider CHARLIE'S PENNY made her presence known, dug in to resist that foe's bid at the furlong grounds, dueled into the final sixteenth, but
was bested leaving that juncture. SARAH HARPER moved her head right as the gates opened causing her to come out a length slow, prompted the leading
pair from the outside, vied three wide before gaining an advantage turning for home, but failed to kick away from her inner game counterpart, and weakened
between horses approaching the final furlong. BE LIKE WATER bumped with an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, but failed to
factor. RECODED vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but yielded turning for home, and weakened. LOFTHOUSE was void of early speed two
wide, took the turn in the four path, and made little impact.

Footnotes
DOCTOR NASH pressed two wide, bid while floated out to the four path entering the lane, led coming to the furlong pole, and edged clear. TWO BIRDS set
the pace in the two path, dug in in the three path entering the lane, sparred while hanging on his left lead, but was headed approaching the furlong grounds,
and held place. EXTRAVAGATE laid off of the pace three wide, shifted out to the six path entering the lane, and stayed on. FREEZE POP stalked three
wide, pursued two wide and between horses into the far turn, cut the corner after an inner rival faltered, and chased along the rail through the lane. COOL
RAGS was brushed by an outer rival into an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, then two wide and between horses around the far
turn, and failed to menace. COUSIN LARRY bumped the outer part of the gate while breaking slowly, raced at the rear two wide, circled rivals four wide
around the far turn to come into the lane within striking distance from the five path, but failed to keep pace while drifting a bit outwardly approaching
midstretch, and faltered between horses at the furlong grounds. KEEPCALMCARRYON never got involved. DECLARE THE MOON made little impact. EL
AHIJADO stalked along the inside, and weakened around the far turn. MIACOMET tracked two wide, then chased three wide and among foes around the
far turn before weakening.
