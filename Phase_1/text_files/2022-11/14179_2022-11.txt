Footnotes
SHUTUP AND HANG ON tracked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, then had a long drive and edged clear late to prove best. SUNSHINE
LINDA set a pressured pace on the inside, then made a bid to shake clear on the turn, then shifted off the inside to battle the winner in the lane but yielded
late, second best. COSMOLOGICAL was fractious in the gate, pressed the pace two wide and weakened, held show award. AMAZINGMAE was settled
early, three wide on the turn and came four wide into the lane and had no rally. GOLDEN PHASE was outrun early and swung out five wide leaving the turn
and was not a threat. JO AMY was off slow and had to me motivated early to get into stride and raced wider and was no factor.

Footnotes
STRAIGHT UP GUY stalked the early pace three wide, made a four wide bid leaving the turn, then gained a short lead nearing the sixteenth marker, then
held on late to prove best, driving. PRINCIPALITY was reserved early, advanced on the inside midway on the turn, then eased off the inside and was four
wide by the quarter pole, then decided to angle back in and closed up the inside and just missed. VIOLENT PASS was well placed early on the inside, then
shifted off the inside and pressed the pace two wide on the backstretch, made a three wide bid on the turn and shook clear leaving the turn, but was
outkicked late. ROYAL'S INVASION tracked the pace four wide and tired after six furlongs. PEAKY BLINKERS was bumped at the start, then set a fast
pressured pace on the backstretch and gave way on the turn. STONE SCULPTOR was far back early and wide and was pulled up by the half mile marker
and vanned off.

MY BLUE EYES was away alertly and soon clear to set the pace and get over to the inside, then drew off in the lane to prove much the best under a mild
drive. UPFOR PAROLE stalked the winner three wide proved to be no match for that rival while clearly second best. Z'S SO GOOD broke outwardly at the
start, then rushed up the inside and weakened. SPELLED WELL chased the pace three to four wide and weakened. RIVERBOAT BANDIT was bumped
soundly at the start, failed to menace. TONE OF GENIUS was off slowly and was not a threat. DANNY WHIZZ BANG broke in the air and was not a factor.

ARTISTIC REASON prompted the pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to take over, then drew off in the lane and was ridden out the final furlong to
prove much the best. KAZ SUGAR BANK was allowed to settle early, advanced on the inside on the turn, eased off the inside and came five wide into the
lane and rallied well to get the pace award. NAZARENO tracked the early pace between rivals, then was shuffled back on the turn, came wide into the lane
and finished with interest to just miss the place award. AWESOME LAUNCH chased the pace four wide, made a mild bid three wide on the turn but
weakened. SOUPER ROYAL MOON was well placed early on the inside, made a mild bid two wide nearing the quarter pole but tired the final furlong. NO
FOOLING DUDE set the pace on the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
EAGLES CRY pressed the early pace three wide, made a early move to be clear and move to the inside setting the pace by the half mile marker, then drew
off leaving the turn and then remained clear under left handed urging. TRIBAL NOTION chased the early pace and was two wide on the turn and then
finished well to be second best. RADIEUX was rated early, advanced three to four wide on the turn and then finished willingly to hold on to the show award.
TRUE SUCCESS was reserved early, advanced on the inside on the turn and then swung out five wide leaving the turn and had a mild late rally, missed
show award. NIMITZ lacked a rallyt. LORD WINSALOT vied for the lead on the inside and tired. PALACE SUPERNOVA vied for the lead between horses
and then went bad entering the backstretch and was pulled up, vanned off.
