Footnotes
EARLY FROST was well placed on the inside, slipped through leaving the furlong marker and drew clear to prove best, driving. HOLMDEL PARK vied for
the lead on the inside of KATY THE CAT while racing in the two path, then dueled with that rival, dug in gamely in the stretch but could not go with the
winner late while saving the place gamely. KATY THE CAT vied for the lead and dueled for the lead three wide, then was between rivals leaving the turn
and faded late, held show award. BONITA LASSIE was rated along four wide, then was three wide on the turn, was boxed by the quarter pole, then blocked
by the three sixteenths to the furlong marker, angled out for racing room, then rallied under left handed crop urging and then shied from crop by the seventy
yard marker and missed the show award. FAVORITE DOLL was allowed to settle early on the inside, made a four wide sweep on the turn, but flattened out
the final furlong. WICKED T was four wide into the first turn, settled three wide and tired.
