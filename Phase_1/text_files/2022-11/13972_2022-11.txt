Footnotes
TIEPOLO (IRE) Went directly to the front and was never challenged in the event until the last half mile when MR. FINE THREADS made their bid and rolled
past. REAL GOOD MAN (IRE) Joined the fray for most of the early going as the whole field from front to back wasn't much more than five lengths apart but
when the race intensified, he didn't. REAL GOOD MAN pulled up after the 13th fence. MR. FINE THREADS Sat behind them all for the first mile, although
not a lot of space between them. In the second mile he made his bid closer toward the leaders. Once LONELY WEEKEND unseated the rider at fence 11 he
made his bid to the leader and once in front never needed to look back. LONELY WEEKEND Race just behind the two pacesetters for most of the event,
moved outside for a more clear path before approaching the ninth fence. When it got to fence 11 he stumbled and unseated the rider. He walked off.
GREAT ROAD Never really was in the race and when things started moving and riders were asking for more, he failed to respond. MR. FINE THREADS
WAS DISQUALIFIED AND DEEMED UNPLACED FOLLOWING A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
NOTJUDGINJUSTSAYIN Went straight to the top once the race began, at times opening up by as many as six lengths and as short a margin as a head.
When turning for home he met his only real challenge from the slow starting BOUTONNIERE, then staved that off with a little help from the latter's uncertain
footing on the 13th fence. BOUTONNIERE Turned around as the starter dropped the flag spotting the field no less than 30 lengths, slowly and gradually got
back into the race over the course of the next two miles. With a mile left, rider put him into contention and he responded. Stumbled but ultimately cleared
fence number 13, gathered himself and drove hard home but was not a match for the winner. OUR LEGEND (IRE) showed signs of life in the first two miles,
at times ranging up in to contention with the top two pacesetters, at one time looking poised to strike, only to fail to respond when urged to do so. POCKET
TALK (IRE) sat behind the leader for nearly the entire event until the last three quarters of a mile when BOUTONNIERE and OUR LEGEND got the better of
him then in the very late stages he was very far back and not a factor.

Footnotes
MYSTIC STRIKE sat behind MERCOEUR throughout most of the four mile event until the last three quarters when urged by the rider to challenge. Taking
advantage of two minor mishaps in jumps 11 and 15 by the leader, he was able to move closer. At the head of the lane took command and won driving.
ROYAL RUSE raced behind the pair of leaders allowing them to dictate terms. Sat on the outside of the pair and moved best with three humps to go when
he started closing the gap, passed the front runner and chased hard after the new leader and eventual winner. MERCOEUR (FR) was allowed throughout
the event to dictate terms, leading at times by 15 lengths. Over the 11th fence the rider became a little unsettled and hung on with one hand and on the 15th
fence stumbled slightly, after which his race was essentially complete.
