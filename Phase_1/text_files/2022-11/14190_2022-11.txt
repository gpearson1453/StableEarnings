Footnotes
GOODMORNING ANGEL was last to commence, settled on the outside, moved closer with six furlongs to run, was urged four wide around the turn, chased
outside under a drive into the final furlong, gained the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. CANDLESTICK MAKER settled
off the pace, came under urging before the nine-sixteenths, dropped from the two path to the rail around the turn, gained under a drive into the final furlong,
made a bid along the rail in the final sixteenth but just missed while clear for the place. TEKILA pressed the pace on the outside of the leader while between
foes, vied in the two path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging, spun three wide into the stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong
and weakened while able to get the show. MOSTLY HARMLESS was hustled to the front, showed the way under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail
on the turn, was asked under threat outside the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in the two path, led under a drive into the final furlong then was
headed and tired then missed the show. LORDHEARMYPRAYER came outward at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path
on the turn, dropped back outside the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into the stretch, drifted about in the vicinity of the furlong marker and came up empty.
LACEY UNDERALL was hustled from the gate then settled off the pace, came back under urging inside the three-quarter pole then dropped back, saved
ground for most of the turn then moved to the two path, came out into upper stretch and was no factor. RICELLE was urged along early then taken in hand
behind horses at the three-quarter pole, dropped back under urging near the nine-sixteenths, fell further back in the two path then the rail late on the turn
and faltered.

Footnotes
ACOUSTIC AVE stumbled at the start then was bumped and forced into another foe, showed speed then switched out outside the five-eighths, moved up
on the outside to make a bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the four path around the turn, took the lead in upper stretch, dueled outside of the runner-up in
the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. D'ONT LOSE CRUZ showed speed then moved clear, was challenged near the half-mile pole, vied in the
two path around the turn, was asked for more in the three path into the stretch, lost the advantage to the winner around the three-sixteenths, fought on
gamely in the final furlong and missed while narrowly able to get the place. STARQUIST leaned inward at the start, dropped back outside the five-eighths,
moved up outside the half-mile pole, was roused inside early on the turn, angled three then four wide later on that bend, floated seven wide into upper
stretch, chased the top two on the outside into the final sixteenth, gained on those opponents late but missed while well clear for the show. FLASHY ALEX
dropped well behind the rest of the field, went three then two wide on the turn and was no factor. MSHINDI was bumped shortly after the start then
squeezed back between foes, moved out then settled on the outside, was urged four wide around most of the turn, dropped to the three path outside the
quarter-pole and came up empty.

Footnotes
STAGE LEFT broke out at the start getting away near the rear of the field, advanced along the inside to take command near the nine-sixteenths over a vying
trio, showed the way in hand patiently handled shaking away through the latter portion of the turn, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, edged
clear under a drive and held clear to the finish kept to task. OUTLAW KID stumbled badly at the start and was bumped by CASH NOW breaking outwards
and conceded two lengths to the front, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn, went five
wide into upper stretch and showed good courage to offer up a mild bid and secure the place honors. KADRI vied early on five to six paths off the inside
before chasing tucked three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on to preserve
the show honors. BIG ENGINE vied three wide early on before chasing three wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, angled four to five wide for home
and stayed on one paced to the finish. IN DREAMS stumbled badly at the start losing all footing and nearly belly flopping before being brushed by STAGE
LEFT, conceded four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into
upper stretch and offered no response. Following a shoe repair in the paddock, SECRET RULES vied early on from the two path before giving chased from
the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing along the inside at the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, then weakened to the finish.
CASH NOW broke out at the start under hustling and bumped the stumbling OUTLAW KID, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then
just off the inside through the turn, cornered from the two path into upper stretch and tired.

three-eighths, bumped with a foe then steadied at that juncture, lost touch with the winner nearing the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in the two path
and weakened while able to get the show. CAPITAL STRUCTURE (GB) was reserved on the outside in the three path, checked sharply behind another foe

three wide in pursuit from the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and closed well outside to

seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. FALCONET stumbled at the start, chased three wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and ran on to miss for the show honors. TIZZY IN THE SKY established the front and showed the
way in hand crossing to the two path into the first turn, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths when under challenge for the
initial time, yielded the front spinning two to three wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages. SKRATCH KAT grew fractious in the gate and
broke open the stall door prior to the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing with half a mile to run, spun two to three wide into upper stretch

Footnotes
NOTHING BETTER was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, was headed by the runner-up in upper stretch,
fought back to regain the lead near the eighth-pole, responded gamely in the final furlong and held under strong urging. ANACONDA was well placed just off
the pace, saved ground on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, made an outside bid near the eighth-pole, battled outside of the winner to the wire
and missed while clear for the place. THIN WHITE DUKE settled off the pace, was urged along late on the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, came
five wide into upper stretch and finished willingly to garner the show. CHEWING GUM settled towards the rear, traveled around the turn in the three path,
shifted six wide into upper stretch and finished with late energy to get the last spot in the superfecta. VOODOO ZIP settled on the inside, saved ground
around the turn and improved position to just miss the superfecta. DANCING BUCK broke out at the start then angled in early, pressed the pace on the
outside then in the two path around the turn, gained a short lead in upper stretch, lost the advantage back to the winner before the furlong marker, dropped
back into the final sixteenth and weakened. SCUTTLEBUZZ was last to commence, settled at the rear on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn,
came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. RUN CURTIS RUN bumped with a rival at the start, moved up then was forwardly placed on the
outside, chased three wide on the turn, dropped back five wide into upper stretch and tired. GEAR JOCKEY was carried in early, settled in the front half of
the field, was crowded some while rounded the turn in the two path, dropped back in upper stretch and came up empty. YES AND YES bumped with a rival
at the start, was urged along off the pace, raced outside starting before the nine-sixteenths, went four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and
faltered.
