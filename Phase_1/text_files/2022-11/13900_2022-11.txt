Footnotes
PAID IN FULL set a clear pace, showed the way while being pursued by a pair of chasers around the far turn, and drew off under driving pressure. MY
FAVORITE UNCLE tracked three wide, came under a drive at the three furlong pole while chasing the clear leader, proved no match for that one before
claiming place approaching the furlong grounds, then irrelevantly hopped over leftover markings in the track from the starting gate at the sixteenth pole.
LEAD ACTOR hopped at the start while spotting the leaders multiple lengths, trailed along the inside, began to gain into the leading group's margin two wide
into the far turn, then stayed on through the lane to claim show entering the final sixteenth. SEVEN AND SEVEN stalked two wide, got rank briefly while
puling in the bit approaching the backstretch, then chased the clear leader around the far turn, and gave way in upper stretch. BIG PETE tracked along the
inside, but faded approaching the far turn. ANGEL OF THE NORTH was fidgeting with the assistant starter when the gates sprung and came out multiple
lengths slow, then raced far back two wide, and never got involved.

Footnotes
ONCOMING TRAIN stalked along the inside, pursued from the pocket around the turn, got blocked behind the leading wall entering the lane, yet found a
clear seam between at the furlong grounds, kicked through leaving that juncture, struck the front a sixteenth from home, and drew clear. BIG BOSS BEN
forced the pace two wide, vied around the turn as outer foes pressed on, inched an advantage between horses while shifting to the three path entering the
lane, repelled outer challenges through upper stretch, but failed to resist ONCOMING TRAIN's bid in the final furlong, then fended off an outer rival for place
to the wire. SONO GRATO broke a step slowly, laid off of the pace along the inside under consistent urging, shifted outside of the leading quartet turning for
home before being floated to the five path entering the lane, completed a bid in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner bidder leading the furlong
grounds, kept on in hopes of gaining place late, but was staved off. ROMANCER broke a bit outwardly stalked the top pair from the outside, ranged up to
bid turning for home, vied in the four path and between horses in upper stretch, but gave way entering the final furlong. RIGHT OF RUSH subtly took back
from a bit of tight quarters early on, trailed in the three path around the turn, then failed to factor while hanging on his left lead. BANKROLL set the pace
inside of a pressing foe, but was headed while inside of a pair of foes passing the five sixteenths pole, and weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CORTESE broke inwardly while last away, rushed to set the pace inside of a prompting rival, glided away from that foe turning for home before the rider
peeked for competition entering the lane, saw none and continued to widen under light right handed shoulder taps through midstretch, and was put to wraps
nearing the final sixteenth. LORD GRANTHAM laid at the rear in the three path, fanned to the five path entering the lane, and stayed on to reach place
nearing the sixteenth marker. EL GAVILAN prompted the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader turning for home, tired, and lost place
approaching the sixteenth pole. BACK BEAT lacked speed along the inside, surpassed a tiring rival turning for home, and sustained improvement along the
rail through the lane. I'M WIDE AWAKE broke outwardly multiple paths, stalked three wide, and faded. BOURBON THERAPY leaned out a the start without
making contact, then chased along the inside, but weakened at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
COTTON CANDY ANNIE tracked two to three wide, bid entering the lane sparking a duel with an inner LIGHTER KNOT, took a mild brush from that foe
while sparring entering the final furlong, forged a narrow advantage while exchanging slightly more serious contact at the sixteenth pole, and edged ahead
late to prevail. GRAY FROST stalked outside of the pace setter, chased that foe around the far turn as an outer rival ranged up, shifted in while getting
outkicked entering the lane, then kept on while pursuing inside of of the embattled leading pair through midstretch, crept closer in the closing stages in
hopes of producing a late bid, but did not have enough while narrowly reaching place. LIGHTER KNOT set the pace along the inside, shifted out to meet
COTTON CANDY ANNIE's bid entering the lane, dueled while brushing that foe in midstretch, then exchanged a firmer bump at the sixteenth pole before
being bested by that foe and losing place at the wire. PERFECT ROSE tracked along the inside, shifted to the five path entering the lane to take aim, but
failed to progress. TRIBAL SPIRIT broke a step slowly and failed to factor from the four path. LEXINGTON DIAMOND was off slow and never got involved.
VICTORY'S FLAME came out half a beat slow, stalked along the inside, but stopped around the far turn, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
BEYBLADER stalked two wide and between horses, tipped outside of the leading trio at the half mile pole, pressed them while bidding around the far turn,
sparked a duel along with an inner MAJESTIC FLAG nearing the lane, forged a narrow advantage in upper stretch, and desperately clung to that margin
through the late stages. MAJESTIC FLAG checked lightly entering the first turn as an outer foe crossed over, pressed that rival from the outside while in the
three path, vied three wide and between horses around the far turn, led turning for home, but was headed by his outer counterpart in upper stretch, drifted in
subtly at the furlong grounds while sustaining the duel, flopped back to his left lead approaching the final sixteenth, regained even terms late, but missed via
a head-bob. LIAM THE BRAVE set the pace along the inside, vied with a trio of outer foes around the far turn, yielded to a pair of them entering the lane, yet
kept on well thereafter. BIGGIE stalked along the inside, decisively split the leaders two wide to bid at the half mile pole, vied among foes around the far
turn, but weakened turning for home. MADISON LUVS DUKE checked lightly early on, saved ground off of the pace, improved to track approaching the far
turn, but failed to keep pace despite strong urging around that bend, then shifted out in upper stretch, and managed to keep on. PAID TWICE failed to factor
while in the four to five paths. CROW'S NEST tracked three wide and between horses, but failed to sustain that position down the backstretch, then failed to
respond to urging around the far turn. MINT reared as the gates were opening and slammed her head into the top of the stall, came out many lengths
behind the field in the aftermath, then was distanced around the first turn before pulling up entering the backstretch, and walked off. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
AWESOME AARON set a clear pace, widened his margin in upper stretch, and was driven home to seal the deal. KUNSHAN BRIDGE tracked in the four
path, claimed place approaching the three sixteenths pole while not threatening the leader, and ran on. BONUS APPRECIATION laid off of the pace along
the inside, shifted out to the five path entering the lane, and stayed on to gain show in midstretch. CLASSIC KING took a mild brush from an outer foe soon
after the start, trailed the field in the five to six path, then failed to menace before moving up in the final furlong. ST ANDREWS chased along the inside
while holding a lane outside of the clear pace setter, and tired. LIGHTNING STRUCK stalked two wide while in the three path, and gave way.
SHINNECOCK HILLS broke a step slow, lacked speed in the four to three paths, and was outrun.

WAYAKIN pressed two wide, gained an advantage entering the turn, showed the way in the two path as an outer foe inched closer to press turning for
home, but swiftly repelled that foe entering the lane, drew off in upper stretch, and widened under driving pressure. W W CRAZY settled far back in the three
path, swung to the five path turning for home, grinded away in pursuit of a pair of inner rivals for place in the final furlong, and reeled them in in the shadow
of the wire. EMERALD EXPRESS chased along the inside, surpassed an inner tiring rival around the turn, then stayed on along the inside to claim place
from an outer rival entering the final sixteenth, but got caught late. TANGO CHARLIE stalked three wide, pressed the leader turning for home, but failed to
keep pace in upper stretch, lost place to an inner foe a sixteenth from home, and yielded between horses. MO'S MOJO tracked four wide, but gave way.
AMERICAN TATTOO (ARG) chased forwardly for a quarter mile, but weakened approaching the turn, trailed entering the lane, and surpassed tired rivals.
BOLDISH was last away, took the turn in the four to five path while at the rear, and never got involved. TELEPHONE TALKER set the pace inside of the
eventual winner, got headed entering the turn, and weakened at the three furlong pole.

SCARLET FUSION tracked three wide, engaged the clear leader entering the final turn, gained an advantage nearing the lane, and kicked clear. SILVER
DUST was a bit restless in the starting gates awaiting others to load, rushed to the fore three wide around the opening bend, set the pace along the inside,
met the eventual winner's challenge around the final turn, and gave way to him in upper stretch before proving second best. ALEJANDRO tracked along the
inside, saved ground, chased under urging around the far turn, and fended off an outer rival for show through the final furlong. FULL CHARGE raced in
midpack four wide and outside of foes around the first two turns, tucked three wide nearing the far turn, vied for show through the lane while failing to keep
pace with the top pair, but was denied that position. OFFLEE NAUGHTY tracked in midpack tow wide and between horses, but gave way. SIMOVITCH
stalked two wide, but yielded between horses entering the backstretch, and was done early. COMMON BOND settled off of the pace in the three path,
tucked into the far turn, and weakened. WESTERN RIVER trailed along the inside, then far back two wide around the final turn, attempted to mount a rally
turning for home, but was pulled up entering the lane, dismounted in upper stretch, and vanned off.

NEPOTISM chased from behind the leaders and in the two path, tipped outside of the top pair and to the four path entering the lane, bid in upper stretch,
drove clear at the furlong grounds, and held sway. WINTERWOOD broke a step slowly, raced far back two wide, gained three wide around the turn,
improved inside of rivals before shifting outside of the leaders in upper stretch, then stayed on to reach place in the late stages. FAIR DINKUM vied for the
lead two wide and between horses, got outkicked by the eventual winner in upper stretch, then continued to spar for place with an outer rival in the final
furlong, but was bested. ZIPPIN GIGI set the pace inside of a pair of vying rivals, but yielded at the furlong grounds. FRENCH COMPOSER laid off of the
pace two wide, then failed to progress through the lane. TIWANAKU prompted the pace three wide, and faded while getting floated to the five path entering
the lane. STELLAR TAP broke a beat slow, tracked in midpack in the three to four path, and faded in the six path at the quarter pole. ROUGHIN THE CITY
lacked speed along the inside, and was done early. BADGEBALL laid off of the pace along the inside, and weakened.

Footnotes
GIRL AFRAID broke out, set a clear pace around the turn, inched further away in upper stretch, and held firm. UNKEPT SECRET stalked along the inside,
tipped three wide entering the lane, and chased the clear leader home to prove second best. DIVISIBILITY stalked two wide, but gave way coming to
midstretch. HOMECOMING QUEEN broke a bit in while off a step slowly, raced far back in the three path, shifted to the five path entering the lane, and
stayed on. SUSIE'S SAVER bobbled and took a mild nudge from an inner foe the start, tracked in midpack three to four wide, and tired. GOOD TOHAVE
AROUND broke a step slowly while shying into an outer rival at the start, lagged well behind, picked up stride before shifting out entering the lane, and
moved up. REDHAIREDCOLLEEN raced forwardly two wide between, but weakened after five sixteenths of a mild. DREAMING ALWAYS raced in midpack
four to two wide, and faded. RAGSDALE lacked speed, then faded in the four path around the turn.
