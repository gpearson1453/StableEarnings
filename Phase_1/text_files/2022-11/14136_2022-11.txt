Footnotes
KHOZZY VALINTINE had a good tracking trip behind the frontrunners in the early going, angled out three wide at the quarter pole, bid for the lead outside in
upper stretch and drew off at the furlong marker. CHARLOTTE'S SILVER settled in mid pack between foes at the half, rallied three wide two furlongs from
the finish, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch and closed in well to capture place nearing the finish. CARPE HORSESHOE was the pace of the race,
continued up front running on the turn, put away her chasing rival at the top of the lane, was collared by the winner outside at the furlong marker and
weakened late losing the place award nearing the wire. GAV'S DREAM GIRL chased the early leader through the turn, took closer order to contend
between horses three sixteenths from the prize but needed more in mid stretch to threaten the top three finishers in the end. REINS OF PURPLE was void
of early speed and trailed down the backside, saved ground throughout the turn, shifted just outside turning for home and made little impact racing down the
lane. NICOLE'S SONG travelled in middle of the field on the rail in the beginning, offered a mild run inside entering the turn, could not keep pace with the
leaders at the quarter pole and gave way inside turning for home. MOON POOL stalked three wide outside in midfield entering the turn, was ridden outside
three furlongs from the finish, offered little response and was not a factor running through the lane.

Footnotes
COTTON pressed from between runners early then outside going three wide into the turn, took the lead about the five-sixteenths, moved clear turning into
upper stretch, widened under urging and was clearly best. ORPHAN HALLIE was lightly brushed at the break, tracked inside on or just off the rail through
the turn, came out three to four wide for the stretch run, got up for second late inside EXECUTIVE GIANT, who was prominent from between runners early,
lost some ground on the leading pair into the turn, encouraged along coming to the five-sixteenths, really asked at the quarter pole after going four then five
wide on the turn, was no match for the winner and lost place late. AWESOMECREST raced between foes in the second flight just in behind the leaders into
the turn, went three to four wide on that bend, came out in upper stretch and ran on. HELL BENT lacked early speed despite some encouragement up the
backstretch, went four wide into the turn coming out of it seven deep, kicked on with mild late interest. WINGS OF VICTORY raced toward the rear off the
inside early, switched outside foes leaving the backstretch, went five to six wide on the turn outside foes, swung eight wide into the stretch, ran on mildly.
CALL MY BANKER had brief early speed then chased from outside, dropped back five wide and weakened. A MAIZE ZING DOTIE moved forward inside
rivals but off the rail to set the pace facing pressure from outside, steadily weakened. UPSTART GENTLEMAN broke slowly and brushed a rival, was never
in it and not persevered with in the lane.

Footnotes
SELF INFLICTED was steadied running between foes when pushed out six wide into the first turn, settled near the back racing at the half, circled rivals
three wide midpoint on the far turn and continued to close in the stretch to wear down the frontrunning leader right at the wire. D'S BEN was hustled early
trying clear the field getting to the fence into the first turn, set the pace while pressed outside at the half, put his early speed foe away on the far turn to open
up briefly turning for home, was collared by the winner at the furlong marker and battled to the wire while drifting out nearing the sixteenth pole and just lost
the nod at the finish line. MAYITO was floated out seven wide running into the first turn, stalked in the third flight outside at the half, rallied four wide two
furlongs from the wire, closed between runners in mid stretch, had to be steadied in tight quarters at the sixteenth pole and could not recover in time to
threaten the top two finishers. ONE PUNCH CHARLIE had to be steadied off the rail into the first turn, tracked behind the contesting leaders inside at the
half, waited on the fence though the far turn, was in contention inside at the top of the lane and raced evenly for a minor share at the finish. COWARDLY
ACT tracked just outside in the second flight racing down the backstretch, made an early move to bid two wide three eighths from the finish, was in range
between horses at the top of the lane and stalled with an eighth remaining. MUROMEC steadied on the rail entering the first turn to be five wide, recovered
to stalk on the rail in the second flight at the half mile marker, tracked while on hold running inside through the second turn, contended in the two path in
upper stretch and faded at the furlong marker. DOWNLOAD trailed the field in the early stages, continued to settled near the rear down the backside and
could not get involved for the stretch drive. FIFTH SEASON had to avoid traffic issues by going seven wide into the first turn, settled near the back of the
field down the backside and was urged on the far turn making little impression in the later stages of the race. TARADAR was steadied on the rail entering
the first turn, regrouped to press the pace outside at the half mile marker, was roused to keep up three furlongs from the line, could not quicken with
challengers and stopped in upper stretch. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL NEARING THE SIXTEENTH POLE #8MAYITO AGAINST #2 SELF INFLICTED AND

Footnotes
MUSKOKA SUMMER set the pace racing in the clear and off the rail, extended the advantage in upper stretch, was geared down late when safely in front.
JAB tracked inside, came out in mid-stretch and drifted about, was second best. TUDOR PEAK pressed early, dropped back entering the turn and switched
outside about the seven-sixteenths, came into upper stretch six wide and kept on to secure show honors. CEE'NCEESGREYTNESS tracked in behind, was
in range two to three wide coming past the quarter pole, needed more from between runners in the stretch. DREAMS AND SCHEMES rated inside toward
the rear early, advanced inside up the backstretch, kicked on mildly. HARD ROCK WARRIOR fanned seven wide making up ground but evened out in the
drive. KIMONO KATE was up close in range three to four wide on the turn, came out a bit for the stretch run then flattened out. LADY XI broke a step slowly,
raced off the inside, was not a threat. GYPSY MAGIC was not a factor. MENAGERIE was not a factor.

Footnotes
SCOTTISH SYMPHONY pressed the pace outside down the backstretch, assumed control just outside at the quarter marker, was kept to the task in mid
stretch and was tiring late but held on for the win in the end. SOLO ALBUM was off a bit slow on the break, regrouped to settle in midfield between rivals at
the half, commenced her run three wide at the top of the lane, chased the winner down the stretch and was gaining steadily late but ran out of room to settle
for a clear second. ESME steadied mildly four wide between horses entering the first turn, rated in midfield at the half mile point, was ridden hard to go after
the frontrunners three furlongs from the line, split foes at the top of the lane and kept on trying winning the show battle in the stretch. BIJOU BABY had a
good position on the rail tracking just behind the leaders throughout, was under a snug hold watching the co leaders entering the far turn, roused on the
fence at the quarter pole and finished up evenly losing the show award in deep stretch. FLYSOFREEASHLEEB trailed the field racing six wide into the first
turn, continued to see them all down the backside, put in a good rally three wide around foes midway on the far turn, shifted out in the six path in upper
stretch and passed tiring runners down the lane. KANTBACKOFF set the pace up front down the backstretch while pressured by the winner outside, was
collared at the quarter pole, offered little resistance and faded inside at the furlong marker. BLACKDIAMOND DINNY took a stalking trip six wide in the
beginning turn, settled in mid pack four deep outside runners at the half, made an early move three wide into the far turn around challengers and stalled in
upper stretch. LIAM'S AWESOME hopped at the start, made a good move to save ground getting to the fence, stalked near the back running at the half,
continued to travel inside on the far turn and made little impact running down the stretch. BRITISH CROWN tracked three wide into the first turn, stalked in
the middle of the field outside foes with a half mile remaining, was urged for more run into the far turn, offered little effort and gave way at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
FORTYFIVESEVENTY tracked just in behind inside on or just off the rail, came out three to four wide nearing the quarter pole, took over in upper stretch
and drew clear under moderate urging. TITO'S CALLING settled off the pace two to three wide early, continued well off the leaders three wide on the far
turn, rallied inside rivals in upper stretch coming out a bit past the furlong marker and secured the place while no threat to the winner. BEDAZZLE ME was
forced out by a rival and steadied heading into the first turn then steadied again soon after when in tight, settled toward the rear are that point racing about
three wide, continued about three to four wide on the far turn into upper stretch, altered inside a rival in mid-stretch, ran along for show and was best of the
rest. SENSATIONAL SARAH broke outwardly then was coaxed forward inside but just off the rail, was outsprinted to the front by an outside rival into the
first turn, took closer order to press up the backstretch, took over at the seven-sixteenths, led into upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. DOMER
ALLURE broke inwardly, moved forward to stalk just off the leaders racing mostly three to four wide throughout and failed to rally. ANITA MARGARITA
steadied and altered outside a rival heading into the first turn, raced two to three wide till the far turn when tipped out nearing the quarter pole, came into
upper stretch seven wide and ran on outside foes. SEATTLE CAUSEWAY was in range four to five wide, needed more late. WHAT'S MY NAME was in tight
at the break, trailed near inside early, came out for the stretch run, improved position. DANISH DYNAMITE was forced out a bit into the first turn, raced five
wide on that bend, was about mid-pack into the far turn going five to six wide on that bend, was empty for the drive. ALCOM'SOUTINTHWASH forced the
pace three wide, faltered and faded. INDIANA ROAD was off slowly, moved forward four to six wide early, continued six deep on the far turn, dropped back
and tired. MRS. C saved ground but failed to threaten.

Footnotes
HARD EDGE took command inside leaving the chute, continued to set the fractions racing comfortably on the turn, opened up on the field in mid stretch and
cruised home for an unchallenged victory. AUBRIETA settled near the rear on the rail down the backstretch, stalked behind the field two wide running on the
turn, shifted out in the five path for the drive and closed belatedly capturing second money at the wire. VANTARSI tracked on the rail in the second flight
down the backside, waited inside behind runners at the quarter pole, slipped up the fence in upper stretch and ran gamely to fight on to capture show
money. IMAGERY trailed the field down the backstretch, rallied two furlongs out splitting runners in the three path, loomed six wide outside turning for home
and raced evenly to the wire settling for a minor share in a three horse photo for place. MISS SPEEDY tracked outside in the second flight in the beginning
of the race, took closer order to the frontrunner on the turn, rallied four wide at the top of the lane to make her presence felt on the winner and levelled off at
the furlong marker. HELL N WILD travelled near the back outside foes with a half mile remaining, put in a mild run four wide outside runners on the turn and
could not find more to be involved in the stretch run. GLORIANNIA stalked in the middle of the field all alone at the half mile marker, was roused three wide
running on the turn, could not gain running between horses two furlongs from the line and was not a factor through the lane. HALFINTHEWRAPPER
pressed the issue just outside in the early stages, continued to chase the winner through the turn, gave way between foes in upper stretch and tired the final
sixteenth.

Footnotes
IMA BEAST tracked between rivals in the middle of the field, advanced inside midway on the turn to be in range for the stretch drive, slipped up the fence in
mid stretch and just got up in time for the victory. ARRA GO WAN took command on the rail from the start, was pressured outside through the turn, battled
inside for the lead at the top of the lane, lost the lead momentarily at the eighth pole, rebid to be in front with a sixteenth to go and was caught nearing the
wire in a gutsy up front effort. TAKOTA had a good tracking position outside entering the turn, rallied three wide two furlongs from the prize, bid for the top
spot five wide into the stretch, was gaining on the leaders at the eighth pole but needed more late to threaten for the win. BILLYJANE travelled midfield on
the fence into the turn, was steadied in tight quarters three furlongs from the line, was shuffled back afterwards losing position, recovered determinedly in
upper stretch and ran on late to garner a minor award. TAKE IT EASY was unhurried early to trail in the early stages, could see them all at the top of the
stretch and closed with some interest passing weary rivals the last sixteenth. EVER SO D'WILD was situated near the back of the pack into the turn, five
sixteenths from the finish was ridden hard for more, angled out five wide between foes at the top of the lane and raced evenly to the finish line. MY FINAL
TRICK pressured the frontrunner outside down the backside, battled for the lead running on the turn, poked her nose in front at the furlong marker and
folded with a sixteenth to go losing positions very late. ISHIYAYA tracked the dueling leaders down the backstretch, was in contention three wide two
furlongs from the wire, shifted outside four wide to be in the mix at the top of the lane and weakened in deep stretch. HIT AND RUN offered a mild run four
wide outside runners midpoint on the turn, angled out widest in the six path at the top of the stretch and had nothing to show running to the finish.

Footnotes
IT WORKED broke in a bit, settled toward the back, switched off the inside, came to the quarter pole five wide, was seven deep in upper stretch and
exchanged light brushing with a rival, struck the lead past the eighth pole and drove clear. ALL TIME CLASSIC stalked from outside, advanced three to four
wide, took a narrow lead about the five-sixteenths, edged clear into upper stretch, was no match for the winner. SWATH pressed two to three wide, dropped
back from between runners on the turn, shifted out six wide in upper stretch brushing lightly with the eventual winner, kept on late. THREE MILE LIMIT set a
pressured pace inside on or just off the rail, weakened. WHY NOT BOURBON broke awkwardly and brushed a rival, shifted in and was encouraged forward
three wide, continued three to four deep thereafter, evened out in the lane. INFINITELY KATZ settled inside early, was never a threat. MIA AND ME was
lightly brushed at the start, raced mostly three to four wide, failed to menace. MIGHTY PELE dropped back three to four wide and faded. THE BAND
COMING shifted in, saved ground on the turn but was never a threat.
