Footnotes
GOLD STAR disputed the early pace in the two path between horses, battled inside SULTRY SALLY H in upper stretch, opened a clear lead in mid stretch
and held sway under energetic urging. MYSISTERNANCY , four deep on the turn, was fanned five wide entering the stretch and rallied late. SULTRY
SALLY H , three deep pressing the pace around the turn, weakened the final furlong. BLACK DIAMOND RAIN broke slowly, advanced into the turn, drifted
four wide leaving the bend and failed to threaten. LADY LANCER showed speed along the inner rail and weakened.

Footnotes
GREAT GO GO broke in top despite a bobble, dropped in and set a rated pace about two wide, handled outside pressure mid turn, responded when asked
soon into the lane and spurted away, kept on under solid handling and held firm. SPOTTED BULL broke slowly, regrouped and advanced four wide outside
rivals heading to the half mile marker, took closer order three wide past the five sixteenths and edged up to the inside of a drifting foe, raced as the closest
pursuer in mid stretch and kept on with good energy to steadily gain. FORT FORTITUDE , off the pace while saving some ground, eased out around the
turn, moved up between rivals near the sixteenth marker and continued on with interest while gaining the show. HARD FOUGHT chased the pace, dropped
in towards the rail around the turn, edged up a bit in mid stretch then flattened out late. TOMMY SHELBY , three wide outside a rival around the turn, lacked
the needed response. SILENT SERVICE prompted three wide, bid outside the winner near the three eighths, chased, drifted out to about the five path
entering the lane and faded. HIGH PRINT saved ground and faded.

Footnotes
GOLDEN GULLEY relaxed three wide while not too far back, came under a ride leaving the far turn, took closer order entering the lane, kept on grinding
under left handed pressure, drew alongside the leader in deep stretch and wore that one down to be up in the final yards. NOSTALGIC RUN eagerly cleared
early on, set a rated pace towards the rail, remained under rating past the five sixteenths, responded when roused soon into the lane and maintained a clear
advantage past mid stretch, wandered outward a bit once collared in deep stretch and just failed to last. OUR LUCKY MAN , urged along from the start,
raced in range and moved up a bit past the five eighths, dropped back some leaving the three eighths then found more along the rail through the final
furlong. SHOFAR stalked the leader two wide, was put to heavy pressure leaving the far turn, shifted out some in the drive but came up empty. HACHURE ,
wide both turns, faded. UNCLE JEROME bobbled outward at the break, recovered and raced between runners early on, failed to kick on heading to the far
turn and faltered.

ADDY'S LADDY T N T , a forward factor in the three path around the turn, advanced outside rivals, took command approaching the eighth pole and drove
cleare. WINSTON'S GOLD raced in the two path on the turn, moved four deep entering the stretch and rallied outside horses. KATIE'S NOTION prompted
the pace two wide around the turn, bid for the lead in upper stretch and weakened late. HAMPDEN LANE saved ground around the turn, eased out to the
two path in mid stretch and failed to menace. SUPERSTITIEUX trailed to the stretch then passed tired foes without undue pressure. GARITOFF , four wide
leaving the turn, was no factor. BELIEVEINROCKNROLL set a pressured pace along the inner rail and weakened in the drive. SUNDAY MISCHIEF , four
deep on the turn, faltered.

Footnotes
SWAYIN TO AND FRO took to nudging soon after the start and accelerated inside rivals to take the lead, set a rated pace while handling outside pressure
from LISCOLVIN, kept on under confident handling while joined by two others foes approaching the quarter pole, spurted away when given her cue leaving
the three sixteenths, kept on under right handed asking inside the sixteenth marker and clearly proved best. LISCOLVIN pressed the pace outside the
winner, was caught two wide and between rivals while battling into the lane, failed to match strides with SWAYIN TO AND FRO in upper stretch but kept on
valiantly and saved the place. BAZINGA C broke a bit slow then advanced inside runners to reach a forward spot past the five eighths, eased out and
tracked a contested pace three wide mid turn, bid between foes while under asking near the quarter pole, gave hard chase in mid stretch but hung late and
was out kicked for second. MOODY WOMAN , off the early pace, moved between rivals leaving the far turn, angled out, circled four wide into the lane and
churned on. BUY THE BEST broke a step slow, advanced inside nearing the half mile pole, shifted out under a ride into the lane, altered back in near mid
stretch and kept on with effort. NOVEMBER REIN stalked outside rivals, bid four deep under a ride nearing the quarter pole, wandered outward from left
handed asks in mid stretch and gave way. DIVINE HUNTRESS , sluggish early, was urged inside leaving the three eighths, angled out for the drive but
lacked a solid punch. CLICK TO CONFIRM lacked speed, circled five wide into the lane and failed to menace. HALF IS ENOUGH saved ground, eased out
for the drive and faded. VIBRANT JUDY , away alertly, gave hard chase outside a rival mid turn, failed to kick on nearing the lane and weakened. STILL MY
BABE gave early chase between foes and faltered.

Footnotes
LITTLE VIC , alertly taken to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, was briefly in hand in the two path near the three eighths pole waiting for room, ,
was taken back to the inner rail leaving the turn, gained command at the head of the stretch and drew clear under steady handling. RADICAL RIGHT lacked
speed, moved up on the turn, swung to the four path at the head of the stretch for clear racing and rallied outside foes. AL LOVES JOSIE , four wide on the
turn, advanced nicely outside the winner to the eighth pole and faded late. NIMITZ CLASS lacked speed, raced in the two path on the turn, swung to the six
path in upper stretch and rallied outside rivals. UNCLE BUDDY showed speed, raced off rail and outside the winner on the turn and weakened in the drive.
LOCAL MOTIVE , four deep on the turn, floated to the six patahin upper stretch and was not a factor. IRISH BOOLUM , no factor, was in the five path in
upper stretch. UNDERCOVER KITTY raced in the two path on the turn and was not a factor. STEINBECK , outrun, raced along the inner rail on the turn.
CYNERGY'S STAR , four deep chasing the pace for a half mile, faltered. DEFEND , checked in close quarters along the inner rail entering the turn, gave
way and was eased.

Footnotes
ARMANDO R , off the early pace while off the inside, edged up under coaxing nearing the half mile marker, remained in touch while urged along leaving the
three eighths, swung out to be four to five wide for the drive, kept on grinding outside rivals while under pressure inside the sixteenth pole and forged ahead
in deep stretch to prove best. OURNATIONONPARADE had speed then was rated back off THOMAS SHELBY around the first turn, angled out to track,
moved up to engage leaving the far turn, dueled and gained a slim lead past the five sixteenths, spurted clear under a drive near mid stretch, wandered
outward a bit past the sixteenth marker, kept on gamely but just could not fend off the winner's charge. CORDMAKER bobbled at the break, regrouped and
stalked three wide, ranged up under asking near the quarter pole, gave hard chase from there, briefly challenged between runners near the sixteenth pole
then hung. THOMAS SHELBY moved up outside OURNATIONONPARADE and took over mid way on the first turn, cleared and dropped in to set the pace,
dug in when joined around the far turn, battled to the head of the lane then faded through the last eighth. FOREWARNED lagged back while saving some
ground, swung out into the lane and had belated action. AMERICAN D'ORO , well placed while saving ground, came under a ride leaving the far turn, eased
out for the drive, failed to kick on nearing the eighth pole and faded. WISH FOR PEACE stumbled badly at the break, regrouped and saved ground off the
pace, failed to kick on around the final turn and faded.
