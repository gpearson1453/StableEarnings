Footnotes
CODAS HONOR saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead two deep midway on the far turn, raced clear toward
the head of the lane and drew off under a vigorous hand ride. IRON BERTIE rounded the first turn about the five path and settled off the pace, left the
second turn outside, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, eased outward into the stretch and cleared second leaving
the sixteenth pole. SHESAHUMBLEHUSTLER settled back off the rail, bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and
came along for third later yards. RIGHT TO ASSEMBLE rounded the first turn in the three path, took the lead nearing the nine sixteenths pole and was
pressured toward the three eighths, but was met at the rail midway through the far turn and weakened in the stretch. LITTLE MISS MINION settled just off
the pace and off the rail, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn. CHOSEN MISS was not a factor.
BUFFUM'S BEAUTY took the lead early and moved to the inside to show the way, but was met approaching the nine sixteenths pole and faded through the
backstretch.

Footnotes
SALTY J J took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole and widened at the rail on the far turn, dug in
under steady stretch handling and just lasted. POSTED rounded the first turn three wide and stalked into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole,
raced at the rail on the far turn and finished well while gaining on the waning winner. TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS rated close inside, picked up the chase
from the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. A FAREWELL YODEL settled off the pace in the two and
three paths, gave chase toward the five sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. MASTER THIS rounded the first
turn four wide, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn, eased outward into the lane but showed little more.
THORN OF ROSE HILL saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail. MASTER YOO saved ground
and could only close the gap.

TORCH CARRIER moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was met toward the quarter and raced at
the rail on the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane and recovered the nod in the final stride. SHINY PENNY stalked the early pace off the rail, dueled for
the lead two deep approaching the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, dug in gamely under steady encouragement leaving the eighth pole but
gave up the nod in the final stride. SAX rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, left the
turn three wide, though, missed the nod in a strong finish. CHIT CHAT GIRL stalked in the three path, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced near
the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL eased to the outside rounding the opening turn, picked up the chase toward the
seven sixteenths pole and raced in the five path of the far turn, then weakened. PARTY MONSTER stalked the early pace about the four path, left the first
turn outside and gave chase from the three eighths pole then saved ground on the far turn.

final sixteenth. DETERMINED TRUTH settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three
path, eased outward entering the stretch but flattened the final sixteenth. DECISIVE CAUSE raced boxed at the rail early then stalked on the first turn,

Footnotes
MIMS HAT TRICK pressured the pace four wide through most of the backstretch, contested even terms two deep on the turn then dug in determinedly to
inch ahead of the game effort of EXAGGERATEDDEFENCE through later yards; while the latter contested the pace and dueled at even terms nearest the
rail on the turn and dug in gamely to late stretch before reluctantly ceding. IRISH MCDOUGAL dueled between horses early, dropped back at the rail past
the quarter pole but ran evenly in the lane. FANEUIL HALL chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path and raced evenly in the lane.
BANCO MEDICI chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path then flattened in the lane. HEARNS angled to the outside to give
chase, rounded the turn in the six path and showed little in the lane. A THOUSAND IDOLS gave chase through the backstretch then weakened at the rail on
the turn. BROTHERFROMANOTHER contested the early pace inside but faded past the five sixteenths pole.
