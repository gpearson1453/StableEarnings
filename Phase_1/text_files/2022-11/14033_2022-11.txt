Footnotes
JUSTIN'S QUEST broke a beat slowly while getting bumped by an outer rival at the start, tracked two wide, moved forward three wide and between horses
at the half mile pole, pursued the clear leader two wide around the far turn, shifted out entering the lane before bidding in upper stretch, then gained an
advantage inside the final furlong, and inched clear. IMPROBABLE STORY leaned in a bit at the start, set a clear pace in the two path, dug in to resist
JUSTIN'S QUEST's bid in upper stretch, but was outkicked in the final furlong. MONEY FOR MISCHIEF settled far back along the inside, shifted five wide
down the backstretch, rallied four wide around the far turn to bear down on the clear leader entering the lane, but failed to sustain a bid and flattened out.
MASON A. P. raced far back in the five to four paths around the first turn, improved in the two path around the far turn, then chased along the rail through
the lane. RYE HUMOR broke in and bumped an rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, improved inside of foes nearing the far turn, but only
managed to chase around that bend before fading turning for home. DR. FORMAN stalked the clear leader from the three path, chased four to three wide
and between horses into and around the far turn, but weakened entering the lane, and drifted out in midstretch. WHEREWEGOIN chased in the two path,
and wilted between horses nearing the far turn.

Footnotes
KNOCKER DOWN set the pace in the two path, showed the way from an outer pressing STROBE around the turn, met that rival's bid at the five sixteenths
pole, but swiftly repelled him in upper stretch, and kicked away through the final furlong. STROBE pressed outside of the leader and from the three path
around the turn, bid with five sixteenths to go, but was turned way in upper stretch, failed to keep pace coming to the final furlong, and safely held place
thereafter. SURFER DUDE laid off of the pace in the three path, cut the corner entering the lane, and stayed on to reach show from an outer rival leaving
the sixteenth pole. SPANKSTER chased along the inside, shifted outside of the top pair entering the lane, but failed to progress before losing show to an
inner rival in the final sixteenth. TEXAS RED HOT had his head turned towards the stable-area when the gates sprung, came out slowly, trailed, came into
the lane in the four path, and moved up between horses. MOWINS made little impact from the two path. HIGHER STANDARD chased from midpack in the
two path, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, and tired. STEINBECK chased in the four path, but drifted to the seven path entering the lane, and
weakened.

Footnotes
ALEXA LOU chased from the inside while just a bit off of the rail, pursued between horses turning for home, brushed an outer rival while shifting five wide
entering the lane, sustained a grinding charge despite failing to change leads, and wore down the clear leader in the closing stages. MISS PEABODY was
void of early speed early on, picked up stride while shifting out down the backstretch, rallied four wide around the turn, swept past the leaders nearing the
lane, drove clear in upper stretch, but was nailed at the wire by an outer oncharging foe. GUNS N' LILIES sparred for the lead two wide, led briefly turning
for home as outer foes produced bid, got outkicked by the eventual winner entering the lane, and kept on. HER LADYSHIP chased three wide, bid along
with an outer MISS PEABODY at the five sixteenths pole, but was outkicked entering the lane. GHOSTLY GIRL tracked along the inside, shifted off of the
rail entering the lane to surpass a tiring foe, and chased without menacing thereafter. MO DIVINE laid off of the pace along the inside, but failed to factor.
AISHA R N dueled for the lead along the inside, but got headed turning for home whilst inside of a trio of foes, and weakened. VOGELSANG leaned a bit
inwardly at the start, tracked three wide, but was brushed six wide entering the lane, and faded. LEXA raced far back in the three path and made little
impact. UNDOUBTEDLY was last away, and never got involved from the four path. INSIDE GIRL was restless once loading in the starting gate, then
showed little.

PETIT VERDOT tracked three wide, bid entering the lane, dueled with an inner TOWING through the final furlong, and narrowly prevailed. TOWING
pressed two wide, vied around the turn, sparred between horses entering the lane before forging a very narrow margin in upper stretch, then battled gamely
with his outer counterpart through the final furlong, but was bested. SEVEN SCENTS laid off of the pace four wide while under steady coaxing around the
turn, then failed to progress in upper stretch before yielding to the top two in the late stages. SPYCRAFT set the pace inside of a prompting foe into the turn,
vied with him and an outer bidding foe entering the lane, but was headed in upper stretch, and gave way. C C'S KITTEN stalked along the inside, but
weakened around the turn.

INVALUABLE vied three to two wide, drew clear at the three furlong pole, maintained a wide margin through midstretch, and lasted safely from a pair of
pursuers late. MAOILIN tracked two wide, gained place from an outer rival in upper stretch, and stayed on to narrow the leader's margin while fending off an
outer foe for place. TELLER TO SING broke slowly, rated far back two wide, split foes six wide in upper stretch, and stayed on. LONGLEGGEDLAVERNE
broke a beat slow before being brushed by an outer rival at the start, raced far back while hung in the five path around the turn, came into the lane seven
wide before being floated eight wide in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly. FOREIGN EXCHANGE lacked speed in the three path, fanned out to the six
path entering the lane before being outmoved by an inner rival in upper stretch, then lacked a rally, and was found to have bled. DESTINY'S DARLING
prompted the pace along the inside, backed off to stalk approaching the turn, chased the leaders from the two path around the bend before shifting out to
the four path entering the lane, but came up empty. NO MORE MASK chased along the inside, but faded at the three furlong pole, and surpassed tiring
rivals. HASHTAG LUCKY sparred two wide and between horses cleared her inner counterpart approaching the turn, but failed to keep pace with her outer
competitor at the three furlong pole, weakened turning for home, and was eased through the final furlong. SHES ALL WOMAN stalked four wide, chased
three wide under steady urging around the turn, but weakened after being floated to the five path entering the lane, and was eased thereafter.

TIME FOR TROUBLE stalked three wide, bid at the three furlong pole, forged an advantage while dueling with BLESS THE KITTEN entering the lane,
showed the way from that inner game foe through midstretch, and drove clear in the final sixteenth. BLESS THE KITTEN set the pace inside of a pressing
foe, disposed of that rival while meeting TIME FOR TROUBLE's challenge leaving the three furlong pole, dug in while getting headed entering the lane,
continued resistance through midstretch, but gave in grudgingly a sixteenth from home. MOMENT pressed two wide, but was outmoved by the eventual
winner at the three furlong pole, then held show while chasing the top pair home. MALIBU STAR settled off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the five
path turning for home, but lacked a bid. IYWAAN laid off of the pace in the four path, inched closer to tracking position down the backstretch, but only
managed to chase the leading trio around the far turn before fading nearing the lane. MOTI trailed, surpassed a pair of inner foes entering the lane, and
made little impact. SOUPER CATCH tracked two wide and between horses, but faded at the half mile pole. PEEKACHO tracked from midpack along the
inside, but weakened approaching the far turn.

OUT OF SORTS stalked two wide, vied around the far turn, inched an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, and drew off through the lane. MISTY VEIL
broke slowly, laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out turning for home, came into the lane five wide and between horses, then stayed on while
hanging on her left lead, and reached place entering the final sixteenth. WORLD OF WONDER set the pace, vied with an outer rival around the far turn, got
headed at the five sixteenths pole, gave way thereafter, lost place a sixteenth from home, and lasted for show. CHEROKEE SONG tracked in the two path,
then chased from between horses around the far turn, and lacked a bid through the lane. GOOD FIGHT stalked along the inside, then chased along the rail
in upper stretch before fading. BYE BYE BERTIE tracked in the four path, chased three wide around the far turn, and weakened between horses in upper
stretch. CANDY RAID broke multiple lengths slow, trailed the field, took the far turn in the four to five path before fanning to the seven path entering the
lane, and made little impact. JUDY'S WAY laid off of the pace in the three to four paths, shifted to the six path entering the lane, but failed to factor.

Footnotes
HERO TIGER stalked four wide, bid for the lead among rivals at the five sixteenths pole, got outkicked by his outer bidding counterpart entering the lane,
altered course outside of that drifting foe in upper stretch, regained stride to re-bid at the furlong grounds, and drove clear. JOYFUL HEART chased long the
inside, got shuffled back behind tiring foes turning for home, awaited racing room entering the lane, committed to a rail grind in upper stretch, stayed on
while altering course three wide entering the final sixteenth, and reached place late. ELLE'SBIGSEACRET tracked in midpack four wide, swept past the
leaders five wide turning for home, led at the quarter pole, shifted inwardly entering the lane, showed the way to midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer
re-bidder at the furlong grounds, and faltered. BEVERLY PARK prompted the pace three wide, vied around the turn, but was outkicked by an outer rival
nearing the lane, got herded inwardly in upper stretch, and kept on. DON'T FORGET lacked speed in the four path, inched closer while floating seven wide
entering the lane, and stayed on mildly. THE WOLFMAN set the pace inside of a pair of vying foes, but weakened after another pair of outer foes joined the
fray at the five sixteenths pole. NIMBLE BEAST vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but gave way turning for home. HONORARY DEGREE
broke a step slowly, laid off of the pace in the four to three paths, tipped five wide entering the lane, but lacked a bid. THIRSTY BETRAYAL was off a beat
slow, rated far back in the two to three path, shifted six wide and between horses nearing the lane, but made little impact. CRAZY LEGS HIRSCH hopped
while breaking multiple lengths slow, lagged behind around the turn, and was outrun. GAME BOY BENNY hopped slightly while breaking just a bit slow,
chased in midpack in the two path, but was shuffled behind tiring foes turning for home, and faded.

Footnotes
THE QUEENS JULES sparred three wide, led two wide into the turn, tucked to the fence while clearing turning for home, maintained a clear margin from a
chasing DIVINE LEADER through midstretch, met that foe's bid at the sixteenth pole, dueled to the wire, and prevailed. DIVINE LEADER laid close up
between the leaders early on, stalked his clearing outer counterpart into the turn, tucked to the rail leaving the three furlong pole, tipped out entering the lane
to take aim outside of the leader in upper stretch, grinded away to bid at the sixteenth pole, dueled while unable to kick away, but hung. FAMILY MAN
tracked two wide and between horses tipped to the three path at the three furlong pole, then chased evenly through the lane to claim show in the late
stages. ALEXANDROS stalked four to three wide, but yielded in upper stretch, and lost show late. FIRST GLIMPSE was jostled between horses leaving the
chute, trailed in the three path into the turn, then moved up between horses turning for home and through the final furlong. LT. JUNIOR GRADE tracked
three wide, pursued from the four path and between horses around the turn, failed to keep pace and cut the corner entering the lane, then chased along the
rail while failing to bid. SO DIALED IN broke a step slow while last away, raced off of the pace while caught in the five path around the turn, and tired.
CAJUN BROTHER vied for the lead inside of the eventual top pair, but wilted entering the turn. RAGTIME BLUES broke a beat slow, tracked along the
inside, but was shuffled back behind a stopping rival throughout the turn, and made little impact. NO BURN steadied when shut off in tight quarters leaving
the chute, then got caught five wide while off of the pace, and faded.

Footnotes
KEYSTONE FIELD tracked along the inside, tipped three wide and to the four path entering the far turn, ranged up to bid at the five sixteenths pole, kicked
clear entering the lane, maintained a wide margin from a chasing INTERPID HEART through midstretch, dug in to resist that foe's bid in the late stages, and
held. INTREPID HEART tracked in midpack two wide, altered course four wide into the far turn, tracked around that bend, rallied with a clear
KEYSTONEFIELD to catch in the final furlong, cut in to his margin entering the final sixteenth to produce a late bid, but was denied. BENEVENGO set the
pace along the inside, led from a pair of pressers while taking the far turn in the two path, but was headed leaving the five sixteenths pole, proved no match
entering the lane, and chased the top pair through the final furlong. TIZ RYE TIME settled far back along the inside, took the far turn four wide, and moved
up. DIGITAL rated off of the pace two wide, then shifted inwardly while fading turning for home. DECISION MAKER nudged his inner stable-mate while
breaking a step slowly, trailed along the inside, shifted out entering the lane, and improved. FROSTED GRACE stalked two wide, vied in the three path and
between horses around the far turn, but proved no match for his outer counterpart entering the lane, and weakened. TWELVE VOLT MAN saved ground off
of the pace, but lacked a rally, then irrelevantly steadied behind foes crossing the wire. CALIBRATOR stalked three wide, but weakened between horses
entering the far turn, and was eased through the lane.

PALACE COUP vied two wide, led entering the far turn, and kicked away in upper stretch. BIG AGENDA settled far back two wide, rallied four wide around
the far turn, claimed place while taking aim on the clear leader in upper stretch, but drifted out and failed to threaten while second best. BEAR OAK stalked
two to three wide, chased around the far turn, then yielded between horses in upper stretch. UNDERDRESSED tracked from midpack in the two path,
loomed a danger behind the leader around the far turn, but only managed to chase along the rail while lacking a bid. CAROM tracked three to four wide,
chased from midpack three wide around the far turn, and faded. ROGUE ELEMENT was restless in the gate awaiting the start, but was well handled by the
assistant starter, raced far back, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and moved up. RED FLAG ALERT vied for the lead inside of the eventual
winner, but weakened entering the far turn. SAMUI SUNSET laid off of the pace while tucking around the first turn, and failed to factor. SHADY MCGEE
(IRE) lacked speed in the four to three paths, and tired. ONENIGHTSTANDARDS showed little in a dull effort, and was eased through the lane.
