Footnotes
CHAIRMAN FOX had a good tracking position on the rail behind the leaders three eighths to the finish, chased the frontrunner throughout the turn, began to
reel in the pacesetter at the furlong pole, took command inside the final sixteenth and held safe at the line. BORN HAPPY settled in the middle of the pack in
the beginning, was in the mix for a share three furlongs from the line, angled out five wide for the drive and closed well to capture place. PAPA KATZ
travelled near the back in the beginning, stalked three wide racing on the turn, shifted out widest in the six path nearing the furlong marker and finished up
well outside on the wrong lead to collect third. RED ZEPPELIN broke sharp to lead in the early stages, set a comfortable pace on the turn, was well in hand
up front at the eighth pole and tired in deep stretch losing positions at the wire. MAHOGONY WILDCAT chased the pace throughout the turn, could not
quicken with rivals two furlongs remaining and gave way between foes racing on the wrong lead at the eighth pole. DYNA'S BOURBON broke poorly
spotted most of the field at the break, trailed down the backstretch, could not recover from the start and was not involved in the late stages. QUICK
RELOAD dwelt at the start, was hustled to catch up to the field down the backside, had sight of the leaders running on the rail at the quarter pole and ran
out of steam at the furlong marker inside.

Footnotes
PRINCE OF AYRSHIRE broke outwardly a couple paths bothering rivals, went forward to track in behind the leader into the turn, switched outside that one
to stalk up the backstretch with a little encouragement early on, was given more urging about the five-sixteenths, drew to a narrow lead by the top of the
stretch, was kept busy to hold that rival. HUNGRY WOLF moved clear shifting in to the two path to dictate terms into the first turn, set the pace in the clear
up the backstretch near inside, was challenged late on the far turn, overtaken in upper stretch but kept on gamely. KEYSER tucked in racing just off the lead
near inside, came out four wide at the top of the stretch, was put to stout urging and clearly best of the rest while no real threat to the top pair. PREETZAH'S
STAR was bothered at the break, saved ground inside through the turns and ran on evenly. TASTE MY CANDY raced three to four wide on the turns about
mid-pack and went evenly. GREEN AMAZON bumped with a rival when in tight at the start, tucked in to race near inside off the pace into the first turn,
fanned six wide turning for home and ran on. MANETKA failed to rally after racing mostly three to four wide. ZIPPY HOLIDAY broke outwardly and was very
rank heading to the first turn, went four wide on that bend, steadily retreated on the far turn. BOSTON BAY bumped with a rival and then bobbled and
steadied slightly at the start, saved ground to no avail. HEY LUIGI got away a step slowly and shied from a rival at the start veering outward and losing the
irons, was hard to control into the first turn, dropped back, was not persevered with in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
QUEEN GYPSY rated well in hand behind the early leader down the backstretch, shifted out three wide at the quarter pole to bid at the top of the lane
outside, took control easily at the furlong marker and drew off comfortably for the win. SILENT DIVA chased the early pacesetter just outside at the half,
could not quicken with the leaders midway on the far turn, was shuffled back briefly at the five sixteenths pole, angled out four wide at the top of the lane
and closed in well while no threat to the winner but besting the rest in the end. SPARKLING SILVER was away alertly to dictate the pace in the beginning,
continued up front inside on the far turn, was collared on the fence turning for home and dug in to hold for the show money at the line. CAUGHT AN EDGE
travelled in tight quarters on the rail nearing the six furlong marker and had to be snatched up behind runners, settled inside near the rear down the
backstretch, rallied up the fence two furlongs to the finish and had late interest the final eighth passing foes for a minor role. AGENDA stalked four wide into
the first turn, travelled near the back outside foes at the half, was asked for run outside challengers at the quarter pole and raced evenly to the finish line.
KEY STROKE settled in midfield between horses down the backstretch, was ridden to go on inside midpoint on the second turn and could not be a factor in
the late stages of the race. VELIKIY chased three wide into the first turn, took closer order to the leader running through the far turn, bid between rivals at
the top of the lane, gave way at the furlong marker and tired in deep stretch. READY TO ORBIT trailed the field into the first turn, continued to be unhurried
down the backside seeing all of them, could not gain on runners outside on the far turn and make little impact to the wire.

Footnotes
LAST AMERICAN EXIT got away alertly but was kept wide early settling off the pace, stalked four wide into the turn, moved out seven wide at the top of the
stretch, bid at the furlong marker, edged to secure a narrow lead past the sixteenth pole and held from a numerous others. DIAMOND CRUSH was bumped
at the start, settled near inside off the pace, moved out from two wide on the turn swinging ten deep into upper stretch, gained steadily outside but missed.
COMBATIVE stalked early from outside, eased back and moved in a bit entering the turn, went three to four deep on that bend, came out for the stretch run
then altered outside foes nine wide by mid-stretch, kicked on well but was too late. LENNY K advanced inside into and on the turn, clipped heels of the
leader nearing the top of the stretch, stumbled and almost lost the rider, recovered and was gaining late inside. SOUPER SUCCESS shifted in to stalk in
behind the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, bid between rivals outside the quarter pole while moving out four to five wide at the top of the stretch,
had a narrow lead through upper stretch and was outkicked. DECIMATOR was lightly brushed at the break, raced just off the rail through the turn shifting
five wide into upper stretch, ran on. DRAGON'S BREW made a sweeping six wide move coming to the quarter pole, bid in upper stretch taking a very
narrow and brief lead at the furlong marker but could not sustain the effort and flattened out. EPILOGUE swung ten wide into upper stretch, moved inside a
rival, needed more. DUKE OF CARTHANIA bumped a rival at the start, raced at the back and was never near enough to threaten. TAKE A CHANCE was
urged at the break, set the pace near inside, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
MOON LANDING had a good tracking position outside on the turn, pounced on the leaders four wide at the top of the lane, took control at the furlong
marker and drew clear in deep stretch. SILVER PEAK tracked behind the leader on the rail in the beginning, waited inside throughout the turn, looked for
clear running room behind the engaging front trio at the top of the stretch, shifted out in the four path off tiring rivals and finished up with intent to get up for
second money. LANIGAN lacked early speed to trail the pack at the half, became interested on the rail two furlongs from the finish, found his best stride late
to split runners in deep stretch and just missed closing in for the place award. MIDNIGHT IN MALIBU chased the frontrunner on the turn, led briefly between
horses turning for home, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch and faded late to be on the wrong end of a three horse photo for second
place at the finish line. HEY CUE broke in the air at the start, settled near the back at the half mile marker, was ridden inside through the turn, angled out
five wide at the top of the stretch and finished up with an even effort the wire. ALPHA MEISTER dwelt at the break to trail the field in the beginning,
recovered to be involved stalking the leaders outside three furlongs from the wire, was floated out to the six path for the stretch drive and faded at the
furlong marker. MUSICAL STRIDE broke sharp to set the fractions in the early stages, was collared inside turning for home, gave way at the eighth pole and
faltered the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE KNIGHT, unhurried racing at the rear inside, switched out early up the backstretch, advanced outside foes four to five wide on the far turn, bid in
tandem with another past the eighth pole, had a narrow lead at the sixteenth pole but shared the victory with yet another rival, ENGLISH CONQUEROR,
who tucked in and settled well off the pace saving ground on the first turn, continued inside foes on the far turn, moved out a path for the drive, rallied
between foes nearing the sixteenth and just got up to share the win. IRONSTONE tracked inside on or just off the rail, moved out further late on the far turn
while commencing a move, bid inside ELUSIVE KNIGHT and between runners past the furlong marker but was outkicked. THE MINKSTER raced a bit
erratic in the early going but went to the front to set the pace three to four deep on the first turn and in the clear, was joined by an inside rival who took the
lead at the five-eighths, regained command at the three-eighths and was clear at the quarter pole, challenged in the stretch and lacked the needed late kick.
DUN DRUM saved ground inside early, advanced two to three wide on the far turn coming four deep past the quarter pole, lacked the needed late kick.
PRIDEOFDISTINCTION raced outside toward the back two to three wide through the first turn, continued three then five wide on the far turn, was never a
threat. PRIMO TOUCH was in tight early, moved forward inside the lead but off the fence to force the pace from the five-eighths till the three-eighths, was in
a bit tight nearing the quarter pole while weakening and faded.

Footnotes
MEGAYACHT had a good tracking trip inside behind the early leader in the early stages of the race, continued to wait on the fence through the far turn,
dipped inside from the two path in mid stretch and ran on up the fence in the last sixteenth for the victory. DOLDER GRAND took command from the start,
opened up on his pressing challengers entering the backstretch, was headed outside two furlongs from the wire, put away that early bid to again open up
mildly in mid stretch and could not find more late to hold off the closing winner inside. ARTURO TOSCANINI (IRE) was nestled on the rail at the half mile
marker in the middle of the field, advanced between foes three eighths from wire, angled out five wide for the drive and finished up well to capture third. A
THREAD OF BLUE was situated in mid pack on the rail under a snug hold in the beginning, relaxed near the rear down the backside, took closer order
rallying up the fence on the second turn, lost his rail path at the eighth pole, shifted just outside and had to settle on the fringes in the end. ENTRY TO
HEAVEN travelled in the middle of the pack just outside into the backstretch, advanced outside runners at the half, was urged on three wide on the far turn
to bid for the lead at the quarter marker, was repelled at the eighth pole and weakened the final sixteenth. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE settled near the back
just off the fence at the half mile marker, angled out in the seven path turning for home and showed some interest to pass leg weary runners in the stretch.
ENCHANT ME settled near the back at the half, offered a brief rally midpoint on the turn three wide, shifted out to the five path to be in the hunt for a share
and stalled at the furlong marker. READY FOR THE LADY trailed the field on the rail in the beginning stages, could see all of them into the far turn, angled
out for the drive five wide and could not get involved through the stretch. SPECIAL FORCES was hustled early to press the pace between foes into the first
turn, chased the frontrunner down the backside to the quarter pole, was asked for more run between rivals at the top of the lane and tired in mid stretch.
BREAKING ALONE chased three wide into the first turn, rated back outside entering the backstretch, travelled mid pack while ridden to keep up three
furlongs to the finish and retreated at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
MALIBU EDGE set the pace racing off the rail in the two to three path, was clear into upper stretch, just held. SHAMATEUR tracked from inside on or just off
the rail, saved ground through both turns, came out a path in mid-stretch, once with a clear path and aim on the leader made a steady slow gain that just fell
short. WINSTON BLUE brushed with a rival after the start, was urged forward to stalk three to four wide, went four then five deep on the far turn, kept on
late to secure show honors. MIDWAY MISCHIEF was caught four wide into the first turn, raced off the leaders, swung six wide into the stretch and gained
late outside. ICE ROAD brushed with a foe after the break, tucked in racing on or just off the rail throughout while settled off the early pace, gained willingly
inside but had no room in behind nearing the wire. REPEAT THE HEAT was within range two to three wide turning for home after racing in those paths
throughout, lacked the needed late kick. CAPE COD raced three to five wide on the turns, needed more. BASKETBALL JONES switched out racing in
behind the eventual winner, pursued that one three wide, steadily retreated. VIVID VIXEN raced off the pace three wide early, tired, was eased and walked
off.

Footnotes
DILETTANTE tracked all alone in mid pack entering the turn, began to rally three wide two furlongs from the line, angled out five wide for the stretch drive
and was full of run outside at the furlong marker to take control drawing off at the finish line. EMICRACK (CHI) broke sharp to lead after the break, was
reined in on the fence at the half mile marker to track outside, began to reel in the early speedster just outside at the quarter pole, took over the top spot in
upper stretch, was headed by the winner outside nearing the sixteenth pole, offered little resistance but held safe for the place award in the end. STORMY
SOUL rated behind the early speedsters down the backstretch, roused three furlongs from the finish to close in on the front two, contended four wide
between runners turning for home but needed more in the final eighth to threaten for the top spot. TRICKY MAGICIAN travelled three wide through the turn
in midfield, shifted out to the five path having clear run in upper stretch and found some more interest late to get up for a minor role outside. SPEEDY BOLT
settled on the rail near the rear down the backside, trailed the field saving ground through the turn and showed some late energy to pass tiring runners up
the fence in deep stretch. WESTERN TROUBLE trailed between foes entering the turn, began to offer a run with rivals on either side at the quarter marker,
angled out in the five path at the furlong marker to be in the mix for a share of the prize and faded the last sixteenth. DIXIE GIANT settled in the middle of
the pack on the rail through the turn, could not gain on the leaders when urged on the turn, shifted three wide in mid stretch and could not be a factor
running to the wire. JIBARO was away alertly to lead down the backstretch, continued setting a fast pace up front on the turn, was collared outside at the
quarter marker, gave way at the top of the stretch and stopped the final eighth.

Footnotes
HAVE A SOUPER DAY stalked the pace from outside four wide into the turn, took aim in the stretch, struck the lead past the sixteenth and inched away.
PRICELESS WILL stalked three wide into the turn, shifted to the rail on that bend, bid inside past the sixteenth but was only second best. REAL MONEY set
the pace racing off the inside, was outkicked. THE GREAT OZ raced between rivals mid-pack just off the early leaders, came out in upper stretch, was best
of the rest. SALVATOR MUNDI tracked inside the second group, switched out coming to the five-sixteenths to be three wide by the quarter pole, ran on
mildly. BET N WIN was up close early, dropped back, went four wide on the turn, kept on in the stretch. LAPOCHKA settled off the pace near inside, swung
seven wide into the stretch, ran on mildly. SOUPER COHIBA shifted in past the gap, went two to three wide on the turn, failed to menace. LESLIE CHOW
rated a bit unkindly early, settled in to go three to four wide on the turn, came into upper stretch five to six deep, was never a threat. MY SILENCER pressed
then chased three wide, came up empty.
