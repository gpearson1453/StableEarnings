Footnotes
CAGED PIXIE disputed the pace outside PLEASE MARRY ME, disposed of that one entering the stretch then pulled away under brisk urging. IF THEN ,
four deep entering the first turn, was well positioned in the two path entering the far turn, eased out three wide turning for home and had a slight rally.
BACKSTREET GAL , inside horses throughout, offered a mild advance in mid stretch then weakened. ALONG THE WAY lacked speed, angled outside in
upper stretch and passed tired horses. PLEASE MARRY ME hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to the stretch and weakened. IMAGINE THE MOJO
raced inside horses throughout and gave way. SHEMADEMELUCKY got out leaving the backstretch, raced wide on the far turn and failed to rally.

forwardly while saving ground, eased out and bid between rivals heading to the quarter pole, wrested command outside BOURBON GYPSY entering the
lane, spurted clear under asking heading to mid stretch, shifted in some and gave way grudgingly. LITTLE NUTTER settled off the pace while saving some
ground, eased out leaving the far turn and edged up between rivals, angled five wide into the lane, straightened and closed steadily. SWEET SENSATION ,
well placed saving ground and within range, edged up behind rivals into the lane, worked between soon after and kept on trying to the inside of LITTLE
NUTTER but was edged for the show. LOVE MY CAT , unhurried towards the back and saving ground, stayed inside with some run into the lane, eased out
past mid stretch and kept on with effort. LOTTACLASS LILSASS , off the pace and between foes past the five eighths, swung out for the drive and came up
empty. EARLEY ROSE , four deep into the first turn, tracked wide past the five eighths, bid three deep and under a ride near the quarter pole, failed to kick
on leaving the three sixteenths and faded. BOURBON GYPSY disputed the pace to the inside of a rival, moved clear leaving the far turn, met bids
approaching the quarter pole, battled into the lane then gave way. BLAME THE IRISH , three wide between foes early, raced wide leaving the far turn and
weakened. BLUEBERRY PIE , between rivals and in range past the five eighths, failed to kick on under asking leaving the three eighths and retreated.

way. TALKS IN HER SLEEP , four to five wide outside rivals, gave way.

DIALING DIXIE disputed the pace outside HARD FOUGHT, sprinted clear in upper stretch and was kept to his business in the drive. NOMO RON , three
deep stalking the duel around the turn, had aim on the lead entering the stretch and flattened out. FORT FORTITUDE hugged the inner rail on the turn,
swung to the four path in upper stretch and rallied mildly. HARD FOUGHT showed speed along the inner rail, disputed the pace to upper stretch and
weakened the final furlong. TOM TERRIFIC , three wide on the turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch and was outrun. EXCALIBUR was outrun. HAIR
OF THE DOG raced in the two path on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
ARISTOCAT rated back off rivals early then stalked inside a foe mid turn, eased out and edged up leaving the three sixteenths, altered towards the rail
leaving mid stretch, closed determinedly under pressure and got up. FRONT DANCER was sent clear early and set the pace, raced off the rail into the lane,
dug in when confronted from both sides leaving the sixteenth marker and kept on gamely. CHEVAL DORE stalked the pace, ranged up outside rivals with
about a sixteenth to go, challenged then hung. BLAME B B chased outside a rival mid turn, shifted in through the drive and rallied mildly. BOURBON ON
THE BAY , off the pace, angled out mid turn, circled four wide into the lane and steadily gained. JUNGLHERLY LOVE , well back, saved ground into the
lane and failed to menace. HE ROLLS chased three to four wide, stayed in range to upper stretch and gave way. SJO AMERICANEMPIRE , towards the
inside, faded.

Footnotes
DOLICE VITA stalked the pace outside KNOWHOWIKNOW down the backstretch, engaged that one mid way on the far turn, dueled to mid stretch then
drew out under urging. KNOWHOWIKNOW , in the two path on the first turn, came in on GALATIANS mid way on the bend, opened a clear lead
approaching the backstretch, set the pace near the inner rail and weakened the final furlong. GALATIANS , along the inner rail on the first turn, attempted to
move up inside KNOWHOWIKNOW but was taken up when placed in tight quarters by that one mid way on the turn, remained along the inner rail
throughout and was not a factor. AFTERMATH stumbled leaving the starting gate, failed to be a factor and swung five deep turning for home. BADGER
TOOTH , three wide the first turn, raced in the two path on the far turn and retreated through the stretch. POINT OF GRACE , outrun, swung to the four path
leaving the far turn. VINNY , three wide both turns, stalked the pace to the stretch, faltered and was eased the final furlong. An objection by the rider of
GALATIANS against KNOWHOWIKNOW for alleged interference on the first turn was not allowed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run around
the first turn but no action was taken.

Footnotes
ORO GRIS rated close up off the contested pace, saved ground with aim leaving the five sixteenths, angled out soon into the lane, closed in under a drive,
rallied past the leaders inside the sixteenth marker and drew clear. GOOD KNIGHT NILE vied between foes early, emerged in a battle to the inside of SEE
OUT leaving the far turn, battled on a tenuous advantage to about the sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly. SEE OUT , three deep with the pace,
dueled outside GOOD KNIGHT NILE from the far turn to the sixteenth marker and faded late. ICANDOTHAT rated off the rail, edged up a bit into the far
turn, steadied when shuffled near the three eighths, regrouped to advance inside in upper stretch, altered out in the final furlong and came back on with
good energy. HENDERSON , in range while off the inside, shifted out and made progress past mid stretch then flattened out very late. PHOTO COPY broke
slowly, settled well back and was taken off the rail past the three quarter pole, swung six wide for the drive and found his best too late. FROG PRINCE ,
three to four wide with progress past the five sixteenths, came up empty in the drive. BUSHWICK BRUISER rated off the rail, edged up four wide near the
half, chased then lacked a finishing punch. CUP MATCH , under a snug hold early, angled out through the backstretch, circled five wide into the lane but
lacked a solid bid. ARLO BELLO , four wide, was not a factor. FIRE D'ROCKET sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, was joined for the
backstretch run, dueled and tired. SMOOZER saved ground and faltered.

Footnotes
FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY , four deep around the first turn, gained the lead in hand on the backstretch, raced in the two path on the far turn and dug in
tenaciously late to prevail. NAUTILUS , in the three path the first turn, chased the pace, was three wide the far turn and closed the gap late in a game effort.
WALK AWAY JOE , a forward factor along the inner rail entering the first turn, rated back entering the backstretch, swung to the four path leaving the
backstretch, circled the far turn and failed to menace. CROUCHELLI , along the inner rail around the far turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and
passed tired foes. SAVOY raced inside horses, chased the pace and weakened. BUSTOFF showed speed along the inner rail, faltered in upper stretch and
was eased the final furlong.

AIRSPEED VELOCITY rated kindly outside foes into the turn, moved up in hand three wide mid turn, responded when shaken up and ranged up to join the
leader in mid stretch, kicked clear after being asked left handed then dug in gamely to fend off BIZ BIZ BUZZ. BIZ BIZ BUZZ rated behind foes nearing the
turn, angled out mid turn then advanced four wide into the lane, kept on under asking, ranged up to loom a serious danger with about seventy yards to go
but was kept at bay. WICKED MAD , a bit sluggish from the gate, settled off the inside, swung out for a clear run past the three sixteenths and closed
steadily. GONGHEIFATCHOY , between runners while up close early, eased back off rivals past the three eighths, regrouped and came back on through
the final furlong. BOSS MAN J J took over between foes, went clear then had his rider briefly lose his balance when shying from the rail, recovered and met
an outside bid, dueled past the three eighths, kicked back clear under a drive in upper stretch, failed to contain the winner leaving the furlong grounds and
faded. HEATHER'S GOLD had speed inside foes, was shuffled back entering the turn, regrouped to stalk inside then came up empty after giving chase past
mid stretch. HE'S ORIENTATE , three deep early, moved up outside BOSS MAN J J and dueled past the three eighths, failed to kick on leaving the three
sixteenths and faded. HURRICANE ANDREW , off the pace, wandered well wide into the lane and failed to menace.

JOHN THE BEAR accelerated to the early lead, was off the rail around the turn, pulled away under urging and drifted out near the sixteenth pole. ELUSIVE
AGENT raced in the two path between horses entering the turn, was under urging near the three eighths pole, swung four wide in upper stretch, rallied
mildly and got the place bob at the wire. MANOLITO , well off the rail on the turn, chased the pace and weakened late. CHOCOLATE SHAKE drifted in a bit
near the four and a half furlongs pole, saved ground around the turn, chased the pace and weakened. ASKIN FOR A BASKIN , checked in tight quarters
along the rail behind CHOCOLATE SHAKE, saved ground on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and was not a factor. SOUPER ROYAL MOON ,
three deep on the turn, faltered approaching the stretch. An objection by the rider of ASKIN FOR A BASKIN against CHOCOLATE SHAKE for alleged
interference down the backstretch was not allowed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run down the backstretch but no action was taken.

STRAWBERRY POINT , bumped and off slow, was hustled up into the turn and made a quick move between foes soon after, swung out into the lane,
moved up outside a pair of foes and gained a slim lead nearing mid stretch, dueled outside rival, wandered outward late and got the bob. LADY MOSLER ,
keen stalking the leaders, moved up four wide to take over soon into the lane, briefly cleared, dug in when collared by foes to her outside, dueled nose to
nose from the furlong grounds, held a narrow advantage in deep stretch but was nipped on the line. MIDNIGHT CHOIR rated in range while saving ground,
angled out into the lane, bid between foes near mid stretch, dueled from there and finished gamely. THE SWEATY FOX , taken in hand soon after the
break, settled off the pace, picked up the pace past the three eighths, swung about seven wide into the lane, shifted out further for the final furlong and
churned on. VANILLA BEAN chased the pace, edged up three to four wide into the lane and kept on with some effort. ISABELLA'S GLORY , well back to
upper stretch, drifted in some leaving the three sixteenths, came back out and had a mild run. BRZINA saved ground, angled out leaving mid stretch and
had belated action. HOLY DELITE forced the pace outside the leader, stayed on to about mid stretch then weakened. FASHIONISTA , off the pace, raced
very wide in upper stretch and failed to pose a threat. CATEGORYNINETYNINE , sent to the front, took outside pressure, went clear around the turn, failed
to hold into the lane and weakened. PERFORMANCEANXIETY lagged back, raced five to six wide in upper stretch and came up empty. QUEEN OF THE
CATS , off the pace while towards the inside, ducked in and hit the rail in upper stretch and gave way.
