Footnotes
BIG CREED was away alertly to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off as a handy winner. ROYAL
CANDY broke sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing four-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best. FLASHIN
ACES lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished evenly late. BATTLEOF TRAFALGAR
was off a step slow, raced five-wide through the turn, reached a contending position but failed to gain late. THIRSTY COWBOY was forwardly placed early,
moved three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and lacked the needed closing response. HE'S A FLYIN settled off the leaders early, saved
ground through the turn and failed to rally. GLORY CITIZEN showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. IGO was void of
early foot, raced off the rail through the turn and did not menace.

RICHARDSBRIGHTSTAR settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the lane and was up in the closing yards.
DRAMA DIVA set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter but could not resist the winner late. PAISLEY'S VISION was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. LOTSA LOU was away in good order to press the pace
while racing four-wide and gave way in the drive. THE COMRIE RULE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and was not a factor. CAANFOOLERY pressed the pace from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and gave way.
BURNINGDAYLIGHT was void of early speed, angled out nearing the quarter and did not threaten. WEST COAST ANDY pressed the pace from the inside
and weakened after going a quarter. NEEDLES AND PINS was off slow, lagged and was eased through the lane.

HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY settled off the leaders early, advanced four-wide through the second turn, responded when set down for the drive and wore down
QUEEN OF LOVE through the closing yards to be going away late. QUEEN OF LOVE raced off the pacesetters early, moved up from the inside to gain
command nearing the five-sixteenths marker, opened a clear lead but could not match strides with the winner late. LADY PHYLLIS was reserved just off the
leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, reached a striking position into the stretch but failed to gain late. ALL NATIVE was void of early
speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished evenly. SEVEN POINTS raced off the
pacesetters early, checked nearing the half, angled out nearing the quarter and did not menace. SILLY NOTION set a pressured pace while racing
three-wide and weakened after going a half. KALLINIKI bobbled at the start, raced five-wide through the first turn, chased the leaders while racing four-wide
and weakened after going three-quarters. CANTERBURY GOLD pressed the pace from the inside for five furlongs and weakened. CHANGED OPENING

Footnotes
HAMMERING LEMON was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and
held sway to the wire. SPEEDING STYLE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with good energy.
STILLWATER BROWN settled off the leaders early, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with a belated bid. KOVACS was void of early speed, raced
six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. SYZSLAK lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch
and finished evenly. THIRSTY KISS was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually gave way. SILENT DECLARATION was
never far back, raced three-wide through the turn and gave way. STANWOOD WARRIOR pressed the pace while racing three-wide for a half and
weakened. LAZARUS COME FORTH settled off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened. RI' PIN SNAP lagged early, raced four-wide through
the turn and did not menace. J C EXPRESS lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not offer a bid.
