Footnotes
MINDSHARE sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace and drew off with complete authority. STILLWATER BROWN
lacked early speed, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out into the lane and was up for the place. JUST PICK IT UP was away alertly then hustled
along to chase the winner while racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain on that rival in the drive. BRON AND THE BROW settled off the leaders from
between foes, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. STANWOOD WARRIOR raced off the pacesetters throughout and finished
evenly in the drive. IMISSBAYMEADOWS raced off the leaders early, moved seven-wide through the turn and was not a factor. RI' PIN SNAP showed no
early speed, saved ground and did not offer a bid. MR. WILLPOWER was allowed to settle early, moved seven-wide through the turn and did not menace.
