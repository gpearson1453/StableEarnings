PISTOL OR SHOTGUN chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming around the turn and kicked clear in the
lane. MR. CASH led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the two path racing around the turn, could not go with the winner in the
stretch and kept on to the wire. SPORTS EDITOR hopped up leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack on the inside in the early going, navigated the
turn from the two path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and improved position in the lane. FUN AT THE FORT raced off the pace on the outside
through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the four path, swung wider still entering the stretch and was empty from there. CAPTAIN
QUINT raced off the pace between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and made no bid. GUTHRIE HALL tracked the leader
on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and tired further in the stretch.

and was empty from there. WHISKEY MISCHIEF bumped with the horses to either side at the start, was urged up the backstretch while racing on the

ONLY CHILD very snug hold along the inside around the first turn, raced off the pace and inside into far turn, shifted out nearing the quarter pole, stayed
clear of drifting foe nearing the furlong marker, cleared late driving. RUNYONESQUE leader around the first turn, solo lead into far turn, pressure from
outside entering the lane, steadily drifted out nearing the eight pole, finished willingly through the wire. COATANDTIEREQUIRED raced off the early pace,
saved ground far turn, gained ground late along the inside, never a threat to top pair. QUESTION MY SANITY coaxed along to be part of the early mix, lost
contact with top pair leaving the quarter pole, no bid late. HANFORD sandwiched back after the start, saved ground into far turn, outrun through the stretch.

BODACIOUS BREN raced off the pace up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and got up for
the win in the final strides. ELARY dueled for the lead on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle from the three path around
the turn, was carried wide into the stretch and was caught late. THEYCALLMELEE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, came
around the turn in the two path and gained ground in late stretch. LADY LANCER tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path
around the turn and finished evenly. NEVER FREE dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, swung wide into the stretch and continued
to battle down the lane before weakening late. LET'S MAKE A ZEEN trailed the field through the opening three eighths of a mile, raced in the two path
around the turn and made no bid. JIMMYDABOOK chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faded in the

CARROLL GIRL led the way from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to expand her lead while saving ground around the
second turn and drew off in the stretch, geared down at the finish. VODKATINI raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside
up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and kept on to the wire, no match for the winner. IRIE EMPRESS saved ground around the first
turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground while coming around the far turn and finished
evenly while never threatening. FOCUS stumbled leaving the gate, trailed the field the entire way around the oval, raced in the two path throughout and was
never a factor.
