Footnotes
INTHEALY set the pace inside of a pressing rival while in the three path around the turn, shook clear at the quarter pole, and drifted out through the lane
while inching away before being geared down in the closing stages with his head cocked. JUJU NINETEEN chased the leaders from the four path around
the turn, came into the lane in the six path, and ran on to reach place late. MAGNOLIA RIDGE settled off of the pace along the inside, trailed around the
turn, shifted off of the fence turning for home, cut the gap on the field in midstretch, and rallied between horses while shifting ground outwardly entering the
final sixteenth, but missed reaching place. SPRY CHARLIE stalked outside of the leader, pressed while kept in the four path by that rival around the turn,
but swiftly failed to keep pace entering the lane, gave way in the final furlong, and lost place in the final sixteenth. HALF A DOODLE stalked along the
inside, and faded around the turn. HEARTTHROB HALO broke a step slowly, laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, and failed to factor. ROCK
STAR ALEX got brushed and floated out by an inner foe at the start, raced off of the pace while hung in the five path, came into the lane in the seven path,
and made little impact.

Footnotes
CANDY'S PRIDE sped clear early on, remained in the three path around the turn while inching further away, and held sway under driving pressure.
ENOUGH HEART stalked along the inside, and held place through the lane without threatening the leader. RESPOSADO stalked outside of the clear leader
and from the four path, then vied with an inner rival for place through the lane, but missed. ALLSTAR MAGIC laid off of the pace in the two path, and chased
evenly. THE MISSING PIECE laid off of the pace in the four to five path, then bore out entering the lane, and made little impact. BEAUTIFULANDWILD was
never involved. STAR'S DREAM was outrun.

GEAUX SUGAR quickly sped clear in the early stages, held sway under light coaxing through midstretch, then sealed the deal under a left handed crack
entering the final sixteenth. ALLNIGHT MOONLIGHT hopped at the start while breaking with the field, tracked along the inside, shifted to the three path
turning for home, and stayed on to claim place at the sixteenth pole. F T W SLAM stalked outside of the clear leader, but failed to progress through the lane,
and lost place a sixteenth from home. CAJUN CRAZY laid off of the pace in the four path around the turn, and failed to factor. UP N GONE saved ground
towards the rear, but to no avail. BUCK DOLL TAYLOR lacked speed in the three path, and steadily faded around the turn.

BLURT vied two wide and between horses early on, stalked down the backstretch before tucking nearing the far turn, slipped through along the rail to the
fore at the five sixteenths pole, and kicked away in upper stretch. EXCLAIM trailed along the inside, checked while trying to improve leaving the half mile
pole, pursued two wide around the far turn, shifted to the five path and between horses in upper stretch, and stayed on through the final furlong to reach
place entering the final sixteenth. I LIKE DREAMING got brushed by an inner rival at the start, tracked along the inside, shifted to the four path approaching
the five furlong pole, ranged up to bid at the five sixteenths pole along with a rail skimmer, but was outkicked by that foe nearing the lane, chased through
midstretch, but lost place entering the final sixteenth. MOSH PIT brushed an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, then along the inside
around the far turn, shifted out entering the lane, but only managed to chase. PLEASANT VISION stalked outside of the leading trio early on, but failed to
sustain that position down the backstretch, recovered to track around the far turn,, shifted out to the six path entering the lane, but lacked a bid. KEYS
INCLUDED bobbled minorly at the start, lacked speed while hung in the five path, faltered to trail the field at the nine sixteenth pole improved in the six path
entering the far turn, but flattened out without making an impact. MASQUERADE BALL set the pace three wide before clearing down the backstretch, but
weakened once headed between horses at the five sixteenths pole. SEMI CHARMED LIFE prompted the pace inside of a pair of foes while tugging under
firm restraint around the first turn, wrangled back to stalk at the eleven sixteenths pole, then wilted around the far turn, and was eased through the lane.

PURRFECT prompted the pace two wide, led between horses entering the far turn, then kicked away entering the lane, and was driven home to seal the
deal. ELLE OF THE BALL stalked three wide, pressed around the far turn, then failed to keep pace entering the lane, and was second best. CHATON
ROUGE trailed, took the far turn in the three path, and moved up. IMPLOSION set the pace inside of a prompting rival, but was headed nearing the far turn,
and weakened approaching the five sixteenths pole. MISCHEVIOUS MEL tracked along the inside, but gave way. RUMPUS tracked four wide, but was

CHARLIE'S CREED sped clear early on, took the turn in the two path, showed the way as BOSS' DIALIN IN menaced turning for home, yet shook free of
that foe entering the lane, and held sway while gradually shifting out through the final furlong. BOSS' DIALIN IN tracked four wide, loomed a danger while
ranging closer turning for home, but failed to match strides with the leader through the lane, and was second best. SUPREMELY chased three wide and
between horses, got outkicked for place by an outer foe turning for home, then battled with an inner rival for show through the lane, and prevailed.
KISLOVODSK broke out at the start, tucked behind rivals after a furlong tracked along the inside into the turn, inched closer and claimed place while shifting
out to the three path leaving the three furlong pole, but was outkicked for that position by an outer foe nearing the lane, sparred with a different rival for show
thereafter, but yielded late. RUMBLE READY trailed and never got involved. CHARLEMAGNE stalked two wide and between horses, but gave way at the
three furlong pole.

MONEY WELL SPENT set the pace two wide, cleared around the first turn, showed the way from chasers entering the lane, drifted out while holding sway
through midstretch, and desperately lasted to the wire. SKY HIGH SUSAN stalked two to three wide early on, tucked behind the leader nearing the far turn,
pursued before tipping outside of that foe entering the lane to take aim, but was steadily floated out by that rival through midstretch, ran on in the final
sixteenth to produce a late bid, but narrowly missed. SERAPE prompted the pace setter from along the inside before deciding to stalk that foe from the
outside entering the backstretch, but was floated three wide entering the lane, then herded outwardly through midstretch while holding show, and chased
well through the late stages. HEART THAT BINDS tracked four wide, chase three wide and between horses around the far turn, then brushed his outer
counterpart while being floated out in upper stretch, and lacked a bid after shifting inside of drifting rivals in the final furlong. BLESSED ANNA raced at the
rear four wide around the first turn, improved outside of rivals down the backstretch, then chased four wide around the far turn, brushed with an inner rival in
upper stretch, and lacked a kick. SPELLBINDING popped open the starting gate pre-race, but remained in the stalls, then raced off of the pace two wide
and between horses, and failed to factor. STRUMMER was a bit slow into stride, saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. EXPLOSIVELY HOT laid off
of the pace three wide and between horses, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
SWEET VIDALIA broke in and bumped a rival at the start, tracked along the inside, shifted out to the four path approaching the five sixteenths pole, grinded
away while hanging on her left lead, bid entering the final sixteenth while changing over, and drove clear. ISN'T IT TIME stalked three wide, ranged up
turning for home, chased the leader in upper stretch before closing in to bid at the furlong grounds, led soon after, but was outkicked by an outer oncharging
rival at the sixteenth pole. JUST ANOTHER WIN laid off of the pace in the two to three paths, fanned to the eight path entering the lane, and stayed on.
EASY ACES laid off of the pace in the two path, and failed to factor. BOTH OURS set the pace along the inside, felt pressure from a pair of foes turning for
home, shook free in upper stretch, but was caught at the furlong grounds, and weakened. BAD GAL RIRI never got involved. JIG TIME BANDIT took the
turn in the three path while off of the pace, then shifted inwardly in upper stretch, and made little impact. HOT PATOOTIE took a bump from an outer rival at
the start, stalked two wide, but faded between horses in upper stretch. BONUS ROUND showed little.
