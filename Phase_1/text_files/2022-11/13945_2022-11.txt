Footnotes
ADDI BUG pressed the pace, moved up on the rail around the turn, angled out entering the stretch, made a bid and proved the best late. NEW DESTINY
went to the front, saved ground, dueled deep in the home stretch and was outfinished for the win. R T'S GEM raced in the middle of the field, made a late
bid, proved no match for the top two, but got by LOUISIANA COWGIRL for second. LOUISIANA COWGIRL lacked early speed, made a late gain and was
outfinished for third. WHERE'S AUNT J raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. NICELY UNIFIED was bothered at the start, racing in the
rear, improved position, but was no factor. CUSTOM CANDY pressed the early pace and was finished early. RUN AWAY SAMARI broke in, raced near the
back and was outrun. MEGANS MILLIONS void of early speed and was never close.

Footnotes
RUNTODAY pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, dueled between rivals down the stretch and was just up. BLACKTECA challenged for the early
lead, saved ground around the turn, dueled down the lane and just missed. SCATAMARAN raced within contention, came around the turn four wide, dueled
down the stretch and was outfinished by the top two. TIZ THE BIG ONE pressed the pace, made a late inside bid, was outfinished, while putting forth a
game effort. BLINDEDBYTHEGEES lacked early speed, made a late gain, steadied down the stretch, getting blocked and was no factor. AARON'S SPIRIT
raced evenly near the middle of the field and was never a threat. WINGS OF GOLD raced evenly near the back, came around the turn on the outside and
was never close. BRAVE MAGIC always raced near the back and showed little. PERFECT PRANK raced within striking distance, saved ground around the
turn and dropped back. THE JOCKEY OF #3 BLINDEDBYTHEGEES LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #6 TIZ THE BIG ONE FOR INTERFERENCE
IN LATE STRETCH. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

PICKENS unhurried in the beginning, made a steady gain, rallied four wide and got up late. WILD BERT raced within contention, moved up on the outside
around the turn, took command down the stretch, but couldn't hold off PICKENS for the win. HAIL STATE lacked early speed, made a late rally and was
outfinished by the top two. MAGAWILDTIME broke poorly, racing in the rear, showed late interest, but was no factor. YANKEE SEVEN went to the front,
saved ground and weakened. SLITHER pressed the early pace and faded. NO PEDIGREE challenged for the early advantage and was finished early.
GOLD MERRITT was an early factor, made a steady retreat and was no threat late.

Footnotes
DREAMER'S DISEASE sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and won under steady urging. DUST EM raced within striking distance, proved no
match for the winner, but was best of others. MUNQAD raced within contention, came around the final turn on the outside and proved no match for the top
two. PORTOS trailed in the early part, passed a tiring rival down the home stretch and was never a factor. RIGHTANDJUST pressed the early pace, racing
behind the leader, dropped back and was no threat late.
