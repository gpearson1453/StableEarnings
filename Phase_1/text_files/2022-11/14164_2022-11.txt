FASHION FRAME hustled clear set the pace racing in or about the three path to the far turn taking a breather there widening when prompted into upper
stretch holding safe to wire. GALILEO'S AFFAIR hopped missing the break moving up while racing five wide to the half mile pole closing the gap on a loose
leader on the far turn only to be rebuffed by said foe in upper stretch staying after it late near mid track in game fashion. OUR FLIRTATION slow early
lagged to the far turn giving a mild rally there racing evenly from mid track down the lane. CHECK SIX stalked the pace weakening on the far turn racing
evenly along the inside down the lane. ESTRELA CADENTE stalked the pace weakening on the far turn. SILVER PACKAGE hustled along tired on the far
turn. MY WYNTER ECHO was always outrun. DAH PHILLY outrun early would tire.
