Footnotes
MAYITO rated two wide mid pack between rivals into the first turn, was reined in entering the backside, began to advance on the rail while well in hand three
furlongs from the finish, shot up the fence to lead at the furlong marker, drifted outwards under left handed urging the final sixteenth and was inching away
at the wire. MUROMEC travelled in the middle of the field three wide into the first turn, was asked for run midpoint on the far turn circling four wide, was in
the mix six abreast on the outside battling for the lead at the top of the stretch and was outkicked nearing the finish by the winner. SELF INFLICTED tracked
behind the frontrunner down the backstretch, was roused four wide between rivals at the quarter pole, raced in the four path to contend for the lead turning
for home and battled on determinedly to the wire to be involved in the win photo at the line. D'S BEN showed good speed to lead on the rail at the half, was
engaged by an early challenger outside into the second turn, repelled that foe two furlongs remaining, was surrounded by runners at the top of the stretch,
fought on stubbornly, steadied at the final sixteenth and held for a minor share. COWARDLY ACT chased the early leader into the first turn, was taken off
the dueling leaders midway on the backside, loomed five wide in upper stretch and stalled at the furlong marker. STREET LEGAL tracked four wide into the
first turn, made an early move to contest outside for the lead with a half mile remaining, gave way between with three sixteenths remaining and retreated at
the eighth pole. DOCTOR UPTOWN settled near the rear in the beginning, was ridden for more at the top of the stretch, offered little response and could not
get involved in the latter parts of the race. AM PREPARED was away slowly on the break to trail in the early stages and could not regroup from that start to
threaten running to the wire. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #4 D'S BEN AGAINST #5 MAYITO AT THE SIXTEENTH POLE WAS DISALLOWED

Footnotes
BABY MO broke a step slowly and was in tight just after the break, switched out heading to the far turn, went four then six wide on that bend mounting
momentum, bid in mid-stretch taking command by the sixteenth and was kept busy with vigorous hand urging while drifting in a biti. J M R BOLD VISION
moved clear and shifted in to set the pace in the two path, was challenged in mid-stretch, kept on gamely to preserve the place while no match for the
winner. ROSE RING stalked from outside, advanced four then five wide on the turn, made a mild bid in mid-stretch, drifted in a bit and lacked the needed
late kick. AIRY FAIRY raced mid-pack outside a foe two wide then three wide on the turn, angled five deep turning for home and switched outside the
eventual winner seven wide, ran on. MS. P'S BELLA was prominent early inside the pacesetter, dropped back on or just off the rail, came again to improve
position late. MISS BOBBIT pursued from mid-pack going three to four wide on the turn just off the leader, flattened out thereafter. WAKE UP MAGGIE
chased inside, dropped back and came out five wide, failed to rally. SHOW SOME SKIN moved out widest into the turn, went five then six wide on that
bend, was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
FASHIONABLY FAB took control from the onset, was headed by the chasing rival outside three sixteenths from home, let out a notch on the fence at the
furlong marker to open up and had some left in reserve to keep the closing challenger at bay nearing the finish. SOUPER SINCLAIR settled midfield
between foes down the backside, was coaxed three wide midway on the turn, had her sights set on the dueling leaders in upper stretch closing four wide
and finished up well but needed more late to challenge for the top spot. SILVER SIGN tracked on the rail behind the winner at the half, waited on the turn
inside watching the contesting leaders, shifted out three wide at the eighth pole to offer a rally but could not threaten for the top two placings settling for a
clear third. CANADIANSWEETHEART chased the winner into the far turn, was ridden hard to go after the frontrunner at the quarter pole, bid outside briefly
at the top of the stretch and stalled at the furlong marker to hold for a minor share. MORE GELATO stalked near the rear in the beginning, saved ground
throughout the turn and was one paced in the stretch drive. A GAL FOR T J trailed the field at the half mile pole, roused for more run inside turning for home
and made little impact on the field running to the wire. SIXTH ANNIVERSARY settled in mid pack three wide down the backstretch, raced outside of rivals
three wide into the turn, urged to keep pace with the field five sixteenths from the wire and backed away in mid stretch.

Footnotes
UNDER SURVEILLANCE set the early pace racing off the inside and facing outside pressure, was overtaken at the five-eighths and pursued in behind and
inside the new leader, came again in the stretch to rebid past the furlong marker, edged clear under urging. AGILE DANCER broke outwardly just a bit,
tracked from off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn, came out three wide in upper stretch then angled out further past the eighth pole, kept on late to
get up for second over STAR SCHOLAR, who settled off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn, finished with interest inside. DIXIE'S FLATTER was
brushed lightly at the break and soon after while being forced out, advanced four then five wide on the turn, evened out in the stretch. HARDWARE GAP
brushed a rival at the start and then after while switching out for room, made a rapid early move outside foes to the lead at the five-eighths, moved in from
about five wide to dictate terms in the three path on the turn, was challenged in the stretch and weakened thereafter. MOMENT OF PEACE attended the
early pace then pursued the pace three wide and between runners on the turn coming five wide to upper stretch, checked on heels past the eighth pole,
moved in and finished up willingly. TREBUCHET raced mid-pack two to three wide on the turn, failed to rally. WHY NOT BOURBON attended the very early
pace then chased four wide on the turn, dropped back. HIGH RESERVE broke out just a bit, raced outside and off the pace, swung seven wide, was never
a threat. GRAN ARTIETUDE got away slowly, was ridden along early but had no response, tired. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND OBJECTION
BY THE RIDER OF MOMENT OF PEACE AGAINST AGILE DANCER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED SIXTH BEHIND THE FORMER.

Footnotes
MY FINAL TRICK showed good speed from the outside to clear to the rail at the half mile pole, was uncontested up front racing around the turn, opened up
on the field turning for home and drew off in the final eighth. FRERET chased the winner three wide down the backside, continued to pursue the frontrunner
on the turn, could not make up ground in the stretch and settled for the place award besting the rest. ERRATIQUE tracked inside with four furlongs to the
wire, was steadied briefly on the fence entering the turn, waited on the rail at the quarter marker and could not quicken inside for the drive to get up for place
share. EVER SO D'WILD stalked inside near the back in the beginning, rallied three wide to be in the hunt at the quarter pole and raced evenly to the finish
line. LET'S HAVE FUN settled between horses near the rear at the half mile marker, offered a brief run four wide outside of foes midpoint on the turn, was in
the five path widest for the stretch drive and flattened out at the furlong marker. NICE COMPANY tracked between rivals in the second flight at the half, was
steadied at the seven sixteenths pole, lost ground to the field on the turn and could not make an impression racing to the finish line. MI TORMENTA trailed
the pack travelling three wide down the backside, continued to see them all through the turn and was never a factor running to the wire.

HATMAKER HOLIDAY moved forward inside to dictate the pace, drew clear under moderate urging, was ridden out through the final furlong. A MAIZE ZING
DOTIE rated off the pacesetter three wide into the turn, was no match but held the place. LOADED VIXEN stalked the winner two to three wide, encouraged
along three furlongs out, lugged in a bit in upper stretch, kept on and held show honors. LINCOLNVILLE BEACH raced outside rivals off the pace in the
trailing group, went four to five wide on the turn, ran on and missed third. CLASSIC QUEEN was in a bit tight early, trailed into the turn going four then five
wide on that bend, came into upper stretch six deep and ran on. PIPESTONE raced between foes off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, failed to
menace.

Footnotes
BODACIOUS MISS broke sharp to dictate the pace down the backside, extended her lead through the turn, continued on up front opening up in mid stretch
and was going away comfortably at the finish. GOLD FORESTER broke in at the start, settled in mid pack between rivals with a half remaining, commenced
her run midpoint on the turn just outside and closed belatedly three wide getting up for the place share right at the finish line. INSPECTOR RELOAD chased
the frontrunning winner in the early stages, could not gain on that leader in mid stretch and weakened late losing place right before the wire. SWEET
EDITION stalked two wide near the back in the beginning, shifted in to the fence midpoint racing on the turn, angled four wide turning for home and showed
some late interest running down the lane to get up settling on the fringes. HALO STYLE trailed the field down the backstretch, rallied three wide two furlongs
to the finish, angled out five wide for the drive and passed tired rivals in the stretch. TICKLE HER TOE was taken a hold of at the break and trailed in the
beginning, recovered to advance inside entering the turn, shifted out to the three path two furlongs from the finish, contended for a minor share in upper
stretch and tired in the final sixteenth. PICTUREDAY JESSICA travelled in midfield three wide at the half mile pole, was urged to go three furlongs from the
finish, had little to give in response and could not make a presence in the stretch drive. ONLY BELIEVE tracked in hand on the rail behind the leader into the
turn, was asked for run inside midpoint on the turn, offered no effort and backed away through the field at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
AMI'S LINK settled off the pace shifting in about two wide, advanced inside rivals but off the fence late up the backstretch and on the far turn, came out four
to five wide turning for home, struck the lead a sixteenth out and drove clear. TEXT ME UP stalked just off the pace near the rail, moved out three wide into
upper stretch, made a brief bid but was no match for the winner. BLU SKY SUNRISE moved clear and shifted in to set the pace inside on or just off the rail,
lacked the needed late kick. TEACHER'S PET settled toward the rear inside early, switched out up the backstretch then moved back to the rail entering the
far turn, saved ground then tipped out a bit in upper stretch, ran on evenly. LIL'S TURN raced off the pace three to four wide early, swung eight wide into the
stretch and showed a good late effort but too little. SAN NICOLA STAR broke slowly, moved up a bit two to three wide and inside foes early, angled five
wide about the five-sixteenths, ran on evenly. ADMONISH raced off the pace two to three wide on the turns and ran on evenly. SPEAK ENGLISH was
caught three to four wide on the first turn off the pace, forced four to five wide on the far turn, failed to menace. BELLA NINA pursued the pacesetter from
outside three to four wide early, was asked for more on the far turn but had no response and faded. UNDER THE EYE switched off the inside chasing two to
three wide, came up empty.
