Footnotes
BLUE BUTTERFLY away well and easily cleared, easily led thru the turn and into the stretch, drifted out in the lane and held sway. BADGER GAL away
cleanly, chased clear leader off the rail, continued off the rail on the turn, took aim in the three path, and failed to improve. DORITA'S LEMON away cleanly,
saved ground throughout, launched mild bid along the inside in a good try. CROOKHAVEN LASS stalked pace off the rail on the backstretch, continued in a
good spot on the turn and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
BOMB CYCLONE away well, drifted out at tad early, tapped right handed early, asked lightly passed the gap and drew off with authority under a drive .
SCOOPS DYNASTY broke out, asked right handed, drifted in, asked right handed and drifted out past the gap, ran hard and prove no match in a strong
clear second effort. GOLDEN BOI brushed by inside rival at the start, drifted out, asked right handed early, asked again right handed midway and earned
third. A POLLITICAL CANDY V off slow, lugged in early and crossed by BOMB CYCLONE, hand ridden throughout and finished willingly. DASHA GOOD
REASON a bit antsy in the gate, drifted out a path and a half, steadily asked early right handed in a solid try. JESS FIRE ME broke out, leaning out early,
corrected with right handed urging, mildly leaned out rest of the way in a even effort. INSPYRE away cleanly, had a wide path, steady right handed urging
and lacked needed kick to improve. IN HOTT PURSUIT bumped by inside rival at the start, kept under a hand drive throughout and bumped by same inside
rival late. CORONA YO broke out, bumped rival at the start, in tight early, shied from leaning out rival late and bumped outside foe. JESS HEZ ON FIRE
fractious in the gate, broke out and brushed rival at the start, a bit in tight, switched leads early and immediately lost ground and lost path, and failed to
threaten.
