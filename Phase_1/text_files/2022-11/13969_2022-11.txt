jockey lost its right iron and prevailed under strong pressure. PENSIVELY stalked the top pair early on, raced near the inside past the quarter pole, angled
four wide and finished gamely to the wire. NO MORE FIRE broke to the inside, settled off the early going, moved up from the inside in the stretch and closed
in belatedly in a willing effort. SATISFIED raced off the early going, angled wide through the upper stretch to race from the outside and moved up to improve
position. NANCY MY LOVE was bumped at the start, tracked the early leader while racing three wide and weakened through the drive. LIKE N' EAGLE was
squeezed at the start, raced near the back of the pack early, raced four to three wide in the drive and raced evenly with no late rally. BLUE KENTUCKY
GIRL sprinted clear to hold a long lead down the backstretch and was empty the final eighth of a mile. CAINUDOTHETWIST raced five wide around the first
turn, raced mid pack early on, was three deep near the quarter pole and never threatened. LITTLE MISS MINION broke awkwardly, raced wide throughout

TOP MULE showed good early foot to set the early pace along the inside, eased out a bit through the upper stretch as Luv U Mary Jane moved up from the
inside to challenge for the lead, dug in and held well in a determined run under steady pressure. LUV U MARY JANE was rated along early while racing
between rivals, waited briefly near quarter pole, challenged from the rail into the upper stretch and finished willlingly to the wire. SHAYMYNAME stalked the
pace along the inside, angled out near the five sixteenths pole, raced four deep into the upper stretch and raced along for third. CARMEL SUNRISE settled
early, ridden along from the outside of rivals to move up near the three eighths pole, raced four deep around the far turn and weakened. HELLA ELLA was
off slowly, sent along early to prompt the pace from the outside of the early leader and tired readily the final quarter of a mile.

Footnotes
FORE HARP showed good early speed to set the early pace and held gamely to be clear under strong handling. MOMOS stalked the pace, raced from the
inside around the far turn and finished willingly to the wire. MAYA PRINCE settled off the early going, raced four deep in the stretch run and moved up to
improve position. NO ANGEL tracked the early leader from the inside and weakened late while racing three wide. TOWN OF GOLD raced two wide around
the far turn, raced four wide near the quarter pole and raced evenly with no late run. SWING SHIFT stalked the pace from the outside of foes, raced five
wide into the upper stretch and weakened. NATHAN DETROIT raced off the early pace, asked far turn, fanned seven to eight wide into the upper stretch
and lacked a rally. CASANOVA KITTEN settled off the early going, raced three wide around the far turn and had no late rally. MT SURIBACHI raced five
wide around the far turn and weakened while racing from the outside. JUSTWAVEANDSMILE raced along the inside around the far turn, angled five wide
through the stretch run and never threatened.

Footnotes
RADICAL RIGHT stalked the early duel from the inside, angled four wide and just got up under all out pressure. PIRATE RICK dueled for the early lead from
the outside of foe, was clear near the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly in a sharp effort. SWIFTSURE stalked the duel from the outside and flattened out
in the drive. GIRLS LOVE ME raced off the early going to race near the back of the pack early on, raced four wide around the far turn and moved up to
improve position while racing from the outside. BACKNTHEWOODS dueled while racing near the rail and gave way. MOJOVATION raced off the early
pace, was near the inside at the quarter pole and lacked a rally. INDIAN LAKE settled off the early pace, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole and
never was a factor. SEMPER FI was shuffled back at the start, raced near the inside past the quarter pole and never threatened.

Footnotes
PRINCESS JAVONCIA was rated along from the inside in the early going, angled four wide near the quarter pole and finished well to edge clear under
strong handling. MY BOSS LADY, pinched back leaving the starting gate, raced at the back of the pack early on, moved up through the far turn, raced two
wide past the quarter pole, angled six wide, surged and got up for the place position late. NEW YORK ROCK STAR settled off the early pace, moved up two
wide around the far turn, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished willingly to the wire. INSTINCTIVE raced off the early going, moved up
through the turn, fanned seven to eight wide and closed belatedly. KLAYTON'S KANDY showed good early foot to set the early pace and weakened the
final eighth of a mile. DANCING TIL DUSK raced along the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch and had no late rally. OIL ON CANVAS tracked
the pace while racing between rivals and gave way. WITCH broke awkwardly, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start, made an early move from
the outside of foes while racing four wide past the half mile pole and faded. VOLADOR stalked the pace from the outside and retreated.
