Footnotes
J P CORNETTA tracked in the three path, was hustled between rivals to bid around the far turn, led into the final furlong, and dug in to split the win. EL
SOCIO rated in the five path, moved up five wide going into the far turn, bid into the lane, and ran on to split the win. D. SILO chased from inside, steadied
into the far turn, shifted out to the three path into the lane, and kept on. FORTY FLASH raced in midfield from the four path, swung out to the five path going
into the lane, but was one paced. MAGIC BOMB raced in midpack from inside, floated out to the six path going into the stretch, but flattened. STARSHIP
WIZARD trailed from the three path into the stretch and was no factor. DOUBLE BLESSING was out in the five path around the first turn, set the pace from
inside down the backstretch but yielded at the top of the lane. HIDDEN WARRIOR stalked from inside but backed up around the far turn.

Footnotes
FORCES SWEETHEART stalked the pace three wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole and drew off while ridden out. DEFENDER GAL pressed the
pace two wide, vied between around the turn, was no match for the winner but stayed on to hold the place. SLENDER SLIPPER set the pace along the rail,
could not match strides with the top two around the turn and held well enough to preserve the show. KAREN'S HONOR failed to menace while racing three
wide. STHEPANIE PRINCESS chased the pace four wide and faded after a half. DIXIE GROOVE played no factor while racing five wide. ROYAL JUBILEE
was outrun inside.

Footnotes
CANTILLATE led from the two path, floated out to the four path into the stretch, drifted out many paths and bumped an outer foe, and held on. GO HOME
HAPPY chased from the five path, moved up four wide around the far turn, swung out to the six path going into the lane, was herded outward and bumped
by a drifting foe, and ran on. HIGHJUMP CHARLIE rated in the two path, was ridden from the three path into the stretch, and rallied for show. FREDDY'S
MUSIC bumped with an inner rival at the start, stalked in the four path, was roused while three wide around the far turn, was driven from the five path into
the lane, and kept on. EDEN PARADISE tracked from the three path, was hustled from inside into the stretch, but finished evenly. MY BROTHER MIKE was
wellback along the inside and was no factor. RUBY ROAD bumped with outer foe at the start, pressed in the three path but gave way rounding the far turn.
BOSSHOG THEM DUKES was always behind from the five path. AN INQUIRY AND OBJECTION WAS HELD LOOKING AT THE STRETCH RUN OF
THIS RACE. CANTILLATE WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND FOR DRIFTING OUT MANY PATHS AND INTERFERING WITH THE RUNNER
UP GO HOME HAPPY, COSTING THE HORSE A FAIR CHANCE TO GET BY.

Footnotes
VALIANT AVENGER pressed the pace three wide, took the lead nearing the far turn, drew clear in the two path rounding that bend, held clear past the
sixteenth pole, switched back to the left lead and angled to the rail leaving that marker and just lasted. HONESTO vied two wide between foes around the
first turn, cleared midway down the backstretch, chased the winner from the rail around the far turn, tipped two wide in upper stretch, re-rallied between foes
and just missed. SIR SAMUEL raced off the pace three and four wide and rallied outside. OSKEE WOW WOW was off a step slow, trailed in the two path,
went three wide around the far turn and had a mild rally. BADBADBOBBY failed to menace while racing four and five wide. BACKCHAT tracked the pace
four wide and came up empty in the lane. BETWEEN THE COVERS chased the pace inside and faded in the lane. VAN DUSEN (GB) set the early pace
along the rail and retreated inside.

Footnotes
NIGHT JUMPER stalked from inside, floated out to bid from the six path into the lane, drifted in through the stretch, and held on. VENEZUELAN TRIUMPH
was behind in the three path early, was ridden from the five path into the stretch, was in tight in the final furlong and bumped with an inner foe, and ran on
for place. GRAND DAVID led from the two path, was roused from the three path into the stretch, was bumped in the final furlong, but dug in to show.
CASHIER CHECK chased from inside but finished evenly in the stretch. STRIKE HARD tracked in the four path but was no factor. BULLET FORCE (IRE)
rated in the five path, moved up around the far turn, but faded in the stretch. RUMBLE STRIP RON prompted the pace in the three path but gave way
around the far turn. AN INQUIRY AND OBJECTION WAS HELD TO LOOK AT THE STRETCH RUN FOR THE TOP THREE FINISHERS BUT THERE
WAS NO CHANGE.

STAT tracked between foes, moved up to bid three wide around the far turn, and drew clear in the stretch. METEORITO chased from three wide, shifted out
to take aim from the six path into the stretch, and ran on for place. THE MAR raced in midpack from inside, floated out to the seven path into the lane, and
kept on for show. GLOBES rated from the five path, was ridden from the four path into the stretch, and stayed on. J P HELLISH set the pace from inside but
faded going into the stretch. K. C. CHIEF stalked from the two path, was hustled from inside into the lane, but flattened. C MY MEISTER trailed from inside
early and was never a threat. GREAT UNCLE prompted the pace from the three path but gaveway into the lane. TREASURE RUN raced in midfield from
the five path but was done early.
