Footnotes
CORDUROY ROAD took command on the rail running down the backstretch, travelled comfortably up front through the turn, was roused in mid stretch,
drifted out under left handed urging the final sixteenth, was clear and held safe at the finish line. MASTER SPY tracked between runners at the half, was
urged to go after the loose winner at the quarter pole, chased in vain in upper stretch, could not gain racing to the line and bested the rest easily for second.
POUND GREEN settled near the rear outside down the backside, started a rally four wide midpoint on the turn, angled out five wide for the drive and
levelled out at the furlong marker to be an unchallenged third in the end. MESA SKYLINE was unhurried in the early stages trailing the field, showed some
late interest angling out five wide for the drive and finished up passing tired runners in deep stretch for a minor share. BE THE CHANGE travelled in the
middle of the field three deep at the half mile marker, put in a brief run four wide two furlongs to the finish and stalled with runners on either side at the
eighth pole. LET'S HAVE FUN tracked three wide just behind the leader racing on the turn, was asked for more at the quarter pole, could not keep pace,
gave way at the top of the stretch and tired in the final sixteenth. ACE DESTROYER settled in mid pack between challengers at the half, was ridden
between horses midway on the turn, offered little response and could not get involved in the stretch drive. PIERIAN broke outwards on the start, advanced
on the rail under a snug hold to have a good tracking position into the turn, could not quicken with rivals throughout the turn and was not a factor running to
the wire.

Footnotes
MUMBLEBEE moved to the fore to dictate terms racing inside, responded when asked and extended the advantage, held well. LUNATICA tracked from
inside, came out past the quarter pole, chased the winner home but could make no headway while well clear of the rest. SMARTY ILLUSION was bumped
at the break then angled in and settled at the rear inside saving ground through the first turn, began to move out at the quarter pole, came into upper stretch
seven wide and under urging, lugged in a bit late and ran on to secure show honors while no threat to the top pair. SKINNY DIPPIN stalked three to four
wide, ran on evenly. ADMONISH bumped the inside rival at the start, was caught four wide into the first turn, eased back and tucked in three deep behind
the leaders on that bend, dropped back up the backstretch, was asked for more three wide and between runners passing the seven-sixteenths, kept on
evenly in the stretch. MILWAUKEE BAY stalked just off the eventual winner two to three wide, failed to rally. PRACTICAL GIZMO was forwardly-placed into
the first turn but caught five wide, continued to pursue from outside, dropped back on the far turn while moving out from four to seven deep and continued to
weaken. CALL ME KITTY broke in the air, raced three to four wide throughout, tired and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
I'M INTO MISCHIEF tracked three wide three furlongs from the finish, was asked to go after the co-leaders midpoint on the turn, pounced four wide outside
of foes to gain control at the furlong marker and drew off in deep stretch. POPULAR VOTE settled near the rear after the break, made an early move to get
a good position into the turn, took control just outside at the quarter pole, laid in under left handed urging with an eighth remaining and was no match for the
winner late. DAWN PHAROAH made a good move at the half to get to the rail tracking inside three furlongs from the wire, waited behind the leader on the
rail through the turn, shifted out three wide for the drive to bid and was outfinished racing to the wire. PROUD SPEAKER set the pace on the rail down the
backside, was headed inside two furlongs from home, gave way on the fence in upper stretch, shifted out four wide at the furlong marker and found another
gear to be involved for the photo at the wire. ENGLISH SHIRL tracked behind the top two runners down the backstretch, was ridden to keep up between
horses three eighths remaining, lost touch with the leaders on the turn and was not a factor in the drive. GIO MARIA trailed the field in the early stages,
saved ground throughout the turn, offered a brief run inside at the top of the lane and could not make an impression in the end.

Footnotes
LUZ DE LA LUNA settled mid-pack inside, moved out coming to the quarter pole five wide was six wide in upper stretch when taking the lead outside the
furlong marker, edged away. SILVER DAHLIA tracked along the rail, moved through inside in upper- to mid-stretch to take over second and battled with
LOIS LEN to maintain that placing. LOIS LEN moved clear and set the pace racing just off the rail, was overtaken in upper- to mid-stretch then faced an
inside challenger, was outfinished for second by that one. OLD SECRETS settled off the pace inside on or just off the rail, came out four wide for the stretch
and ran on. LOADED QUESTION broke a bit awkwardly, raced outside a rival off the pace, moved out from three to four wide on the turn, swung seven
deep into upper stretch and ran on. FLIPPIN raced outside toward the back, asked for more by the five-sixteenths, swung from four to eight wide turning for
home, was unable to menace. SYSTEMATIC advanced outside four then five wide coming to the quarter pole but could not sustain the effort. OHEAVENS
chased the pace two to three wide, weakened.

Footnotes
PARAMOUNT PRINCE broke sharp to dictate the pace, was coaxed for more at the quarter pole, quickly opened up turning for home and drew away easily
for a comfortable win in the end. CRUMLIN LAD chased the leader two wide down the backside, could not keep up with the winner at the quarter marker,
asked for for more to no avail at the top of the stretch but ran on gamely to be a clear second at the line. LITTLE DOMI stalked four deep outside at the half
mile marker, rallied three wide midway on the turn, shifted out to the four path at the eighth pole and finished well to close in capturing third money.
CADFAEL settled three wide mid pack down the backstretch, was urged between rivals five sixteenths to the line, shifted inwards to the fence for the drive
and showed interest to run on for a minor share in the late stages. FLOWERS 'N BERRIES chased the leader three wide in the beginning, could not match
strides with the speed winner through the turn and faded between horses in the final sixteenth. SO CALLED VACATION hesitated at the start, trailed the
field in the early stages, figured it out at the top of the lane and offered a good finish running past foes in the stretch. LONHRO'S GIZMO travelled in the two
path in the second flight of runners into the turn, was roused on the rail at the quarter pole, had little to give and weakened on the fence through the stretch.
WILD CONVERSATION stalked in the second flight on the rail at the half, was in tight entering the turn, steadied briefly to be shuffled back inside three
furlongs left to run and could not regroup at the top of the stretch to be involved in the end.

Footnotes
SPEED TRAP tracked in behind just off the rail, came out turning for home, was four wide in upper stretch with aim, bid at the furlong marker, dueled briefly
then edged clear under steady handling. WORST BEHAVIOUR veered in at the break but nevertheless went to the fore to dictate the pace racing off the
rail, was prompted by an inside rival at the three-eighths, headed by that one soon after, dueled and regained a narrow lead by the eighth pole but was
outkicked. AHA MOMENT stalked four wide through the turn, was in tight in behind rivals in upper stretch, switched out about six to seven deep coming to
the eighth pole, kicked on to get up for show honors over MISCHIEF LILY, who settled off the pace and shifted in, advanced inside on the turn, came out
three wide in upper stretch, ran on with late interest. STOLEN stalked from outside four to five wide, bid in the vicinity of the furlong marker putting a narrow
and brief head in front but could not sustain the effort and flattened out. JUST ON TIME pressed from inside then applied more pressure at the
three-eighths, put a narrow head in front about the five-sixteenths, dueled till mid-stretch then gave way. VICTORIOUS TAPIT broke a step slowly and
lacked early speed despite urging, swung widest into the stretch to run on with mild late interest nine deep. CRUMLIN BEAST broke outwardly, advanced
five to six wide on the turn, came into upper stretch eight wide, evened out in the lane. BE LIKE LEIGH was ridden along midway on the turn going four wide
on that bend, came into upper stretch a bit wider, failed to rally. O WOW was forced in at the break, urged along, chased two to three wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
IL MALOCCHIO was in a good spot tracking the leading trio on the rail at the half, took closer order between foes midpoint on the far turn, angled four wide
for the stretch drive, poked her nose in front at the sixteenth pole and was edging away at the finish. ANGELOU pressed the lead on the rail into the first
turn, continued to hound the frontrunner inside down the backstretch, waited on the fence behind the pacesetter midway on the second turn, shifted just
outside in the two path at the top of the lane, battled stubbornly between challengers with an eighth remaining and ran game to the wire for second.
TRANSIENT (GB) was headstrong early on setting the pace, relaxed up front down the backside, continued to set the fractions comfortably throughout the
far turn, opened up a touch at the top of the stretch, collared outside at the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly in the late stages. SILENT CAUSEWAY
was unhurried early on the be near the back in the beginning, trailed the field on the rail at the half mile marker, rallied five wide two furlongs to the line,
angled outside for clear run in the eight path at the top of the lane and closed well to garner a minor share in the end. CRYSTAL GLACIER stalked on the
rail in midfield down the backside, was asked for more run midpoint on the far turn and could only offer an even finish three wide behind the leaders running
to the wire. CREATIVE CAIRO tracked behind the engaging leaders into the first turn, pressed the issue three wide at the half, was urged to keep up at the
quarter marker, offered little response and faded in mid stretch. OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE was eager early on racing inside under the wire for the first time,
advanced on the rail through the second turn, shifted three wide two furlongs to the wire, angled out to the five path in upper stretch and stalled with an
eighth remaining. CHARGES DROPPED settled near the back in the beginning between rivals, was roused three wide outside foes midway on the far turn,
offered a mild rally seven wide while in tight with runners on either side turning for home and could not offer a closing finish. PEACE SEEKER was unhurried
in the beginning trailing the field, could see them all three eighths from the finish, offered a mild run six wide two furlongs out, shifted to the nine path for the
stretch run and levelled out at the furlong marker. MUNNYFOR RO tracked in a good position behind the front trio outside entering the far turn, rallied three
wide five sixteenths from the wire to be in the hunt, angled out six wide giving way at the top of the lane and retreated at the furlong marker. DREIDEL
travelled in the middle of the field in the early stages, was ridden to keep pace with rivals into the far turn and folded with three furlongs from the finish line.

Footnotes
OUR FLASH DRIVE tracked in behind just off the rail, advanced coming to the quarter pole while shifting five wide, swept past in upper stretch and kicked
clear, was eased up late. HAZELBROOK moved forward to press then contest the pace nearing the four- and one-half pole, vied two to three wide and
between runners through the turn into upper stretch, was no match for the winner but fought on for the place over LOYALTY, who attended from outside,
vied outside four wide through the turn, kept on in the lane but was outfinished for second. AWESOME TREAT settled off the leaders mid-pack and outside,
went four to five wide on the turn, lugged in a bit in upper stretch then moved back out, kept on late but settled for the minor award. BEYOND MYBUDGET
settled off the pace racing near the inside, saved ground on the turn, angled five wide at the top of the stretch, moved out further as a rival came out and
kept on late. ARTIE'S PRINCESS was mildly encouraged early but lacking significant speed, raced off the rail through the turn and into the stretch, failed to
menace. SWEET ENOUGH (GB) moved forward inside to vie for the lead taking a narrow brief head just past the half, weakened in the stretch. LORENA
set the early pace racing off the inside three to four deep, faced pressure inside and out heading to the turn and steadily dropped back, came out six to
seven wide for the drive and ran on. ALLWORTHY raced outside off the leaders going four to five wide on the turn and coming wider still for the drive, was
never able to challenge.

TARA LUNA settled mid pack between runners in the early stages, relaxed under a snug hold at the half, waited for running room midway on the far turn,
slipped up the fence at the quarter pole, shifted out to the three path for the drive, took command with a sixteenth to go and held safe at the wire.
MARDENE raced in the middle of the field three wide in the beginning, rallied four wide two furlongs from the wire and closed belatedly in the four path
outside foes in the stretch to get up for the place nearing the finish. GENEVA set the pace in the beginning, continued to be up front setting soft fractions on
the far turn, was challenged outside at the top of the stretch, drifted out under the drive at the furlong pole and could not hold in the last sixteenth. HIGH
TREASON broke out at the start, travelled near the back of the pack at the half mile marker, was hard ridden three furlongs to the finish and had some late
energy to close in for a minor share. MARALINGA tracked behind the leader on the rail running down the backside, angled out three wide to rally for the
lead turning for home, battled between rivals in upper stretch, lost his path at the furlong pole and stalled in the final sixteenth. SHEZ A SEALY was situated
near the back on the rail in the beginning, put in a brief run on the rail three furlongs to the finish, could not advance further inside running on the second
turn and was not a contender through the stretch. INTRO was brushed by an inside rival at the start, stumbled soon after the break, trailed the field down the
backstretch and could not offer a rally to make an impression running to the wire. REES chased the pace for the majority of the race, gave way between
runners at the quarter pole and retreated at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
LADY MOONSHINE was forwardly-placed inside a rival but off the rail attending the early pace, eased back content to track, shifted out at the quarter pole,
came into upper stretch five wide, struck the lead nearing the sixteenth, kicked clear and held sway. SPIDER BELLE settled off the pace near the rail,
moved out from two to four wide late on the turn, came into upper stretch five wide, rallied between foes to get up for second over STARLIGHT RIDGE, who
settled off the pace mid-pack, went four wide into the turn, was ridden along three furlongs out, swung out ten wide for the drive, was outfinished for second.
TWISTER ALERT contested the early pace then moved clear racing just off the rail through the turn, was challenged at the top of the stretch, repelled that
foe but had no extra late. A GAME was forwardly-positioned just off the leader, went three to four wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. MARAIS
settled off the leaders along the inside, moved out two wide at the quarter pole and kept on two to three wide in the stretch to improve. PIONEER'S EDGE
was in range four wide into the turn, failed to rally. MAGIC RIDE was up close racing two to three wide in behind the leaders through the turn, shifted to the
rail at the quarter pole, had no late kick. RICHIES NOBLE GIRL switched off the inside into the turn, went five wide on that bend advancing some, moved
out further in upper stretch but failed to menace late. HELLO FRIENDS raced off the pace near the inside, angled out in upper stretch, was never near
enough to threaten. ALPHA MIA chased from outside, went five to six wide on the turn, faded in the stretch.
