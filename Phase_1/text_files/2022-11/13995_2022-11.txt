Footnotes
AZZURRO set the pace inside of a vying foe, then shook clear in upper stretch, and edged away under driving pressure, but failed to return to the winner's
circle post-race, was dismounted and untacked in the vicinity of the three quarter pole, and was vanned off. AWESOME CHARGE vied for the lead two
wide, pressed in earnest of the turn, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart in upper stretch, and remained well clear of show. SCOTCH NO
ROCKS chased along the inside, then secured show from a pair of outer foes coming to the furlong grounds. SILVESTRE tracked two wide and between
horses, but lacked a bid. KENRIC stalked the leading pair three wide, chased them around the turn, and gave way. PRIVATE CONNIE trailed around the
turn, and surpassed inner tiring rivals. LOCO laid off of the pace four wide, and faded. GUS GUS was outrun.

Footnotes
FOUR DAWN dueled for the lead inside of a rival, sustained vying position while headed around the turn, prolonged the battle while fighting on gamely
through the lane, and prevailed. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER sparred for the lead two wide, led around the turn, but failed to kick away from her inner
counterpart, relinquished the advantage in the final furlong, and was bested. SPARE A DIME stalked the embattled leading pair from the outside, inched
subtly closer turning for home, but failed to sustain progress in the lane, and only managed to chase them through the final furlong while holding show. BIG
JAVA was bumped by an outer rival before shying from an inner foe at the start causing her to spot the leaders multiple lengths, then laid off of the pace
along the inside, and failed to factor. DALLAS VOLUNTEER rated two wide, shifted to the four path entering the lane, but made little impact.

Footnotes
SAND MOUNTAIN set the pace inside of a vying foe while remaining a path off of the inner railing, shook free in upper stretch before meeting DRENA'S
STAR's challenge coming to the furlong grounds, then dug in gamely, and tenaciously fended that foe off through the late stages. DRENA'S STAR tracked
in the five path, loomed a danger while tucking to the four path entering the lane, bid outside of a game SAND MOUNTAIN approaching midstretch, but
failed to reach even terms while staved off through the final furlong. FOREVAMO laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out in upper stretch, stayed on
to bid for show along with an outer rival in the final sixteenth, and held. BIG BELLA BROWN settled off of the pace two wide and between horses, swung to
the seven path entering the lane, stayed on while hanging on her left lead, bid for show in the final sixteenth, but missed. CHIEF HOWCOME stalked along
the inside, but failed to progress through the lane, then lost show in the final sixteenth while faltering. COOL RUNNINGS chased in the four path, but was
outmoved by an outer rival turning for home, then gave way between horses in the six path in upper stretch. ELI trailed in the three path, and made little
impact. GEMO RAIN tracked in midpack in the two path, shifted out five wide in upper stretch, but lacked a rally between horses and faded. RELEASED
prompted the leader from the outside, vied in the three path around the turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. HIGHER AUTHORITY laid off
of the pace three wide, but was floated to the eight path entering the lane, and tired.

Footnotes
BIG BEEMSTER stalked three wide, bid turning for home, led in upper stretch, and drove clear approaching the final sixteenth. GRIMES checked into the
first turn when an outer rival crossed over, stalked along the inside, chased the leading trio around the far turn, tipped outside of them in upper stretch, then
stayed on to reach place late. O'CONNER SUNSET stalked two wide, bid for the lead along with an outer rival at the five sixteenths pole, but was outkicked
by that foe in upper stretch, chased between horses thereafter, but lost place in the final sixteenth. TALKSCHEAP cleared and crossed over early on, set an
unchallenged pace, met a pair of bids turning for home, got headed nearing the lane, fought on through upper stretch, but yielded coming to the final
sixteenth. NIKOLAS ARTHUR was antsy in the post parade, then exchanged multiple solid bumps with an outer rival in the early stages, saved ground far
back, improved into the far turn, but failed to threaten. BREAD WINNER was herded in by outer rivals causing him to make contact multiple times with an
inner foe in the opening furlong, then got bumped and forced outwardly by inner foes into the first turn, tucked from the seven path to the four path while
trailing around that bend, moved out of last down the backstretch, tucked before shifting back out to the three path while gaining stride around the far turn,
and stayed on between horses through the lane. CHILI RED broke a step slowly, tracked along the inside, shifted from the two to four path in upper stretch,
and yielded. CONNECT ME uncontrollably shifted outside of foes entering the first turn causing trouble for outer rivals, raced in midpack two wide and
between horses, then chased in the four to five path around the far turn before fading. PARACHUTEBATTALION was jostled between horses once put to
tight quarters in the early stages, but was bumped and forced out into an outer rival entering the first turn, raced far back in the six to two wide around the
first turn, and weakened. CAESAR'S GHOST raced far back in the five to three path around the first turn before saving ground around the far, and was
outrun. CAMBIASO tracked three wide, chased in the three to four path around the far turn, and weakened. RILEY BEE broke a step slowly, then shied out
and into an outer rival into the first turn, raced off of the pace in the four to three paths, and was done early.

Footnotes
PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE trailed, shifted out to the four path while picking up stride turning for home before fanning to the six path entering the lane, and
sustained his charge to sweep past the leaders coming to the furlong grounds, and drew off. DRIVE FOR FUN took a bump from an inner foe in the early
stages, stalked three to two wide, bid in upper stretch, but was quickly outkicked by an outer rival nearing the furlong grounds before reaching place leaving
that station. AMERICAN ICON set a clear pace in the two path, dug in to resist DRIVE FOR FUN's bid leaving the quarter pole, but proved no match for an
outer bidder in upper stretch, lost place entering the final furlong, and gave way through the final sixteenth. CARBONITE tracked in the two path, shifted to
the four path and between horses entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer foe while leveling off in upper stretch, and lacked a bid. RUM 'N TONIC
laid off of the pace in the four path, but was outkicked by rivals on both sides while floating to the five path entering the lane, and kept on while one-paced.
MARCHING chased along the inside, but gave way. MY GRASS IS BLUE bumped an outer rival leaving the chute, chased two wide and between horses,
but steadily faded into and around the turn.

Footnotes
FLOKI'S FLIGHT set the pace along the inside, drew clear approaching the nine sixteenths pole, then widened under driving pressure through the lane.
TRIPLE OPTION was urged along in the three path while off of the pace, ranged closer to minor placings four wide entering the lane, lugged inwardly
through midstretch while vying for those position, and gained place with an rightly-cocked head entering the final sixteenth. HITTING BOMBS laid off of the
pace in the two path, then chased from between horses through midstretch to bid for show a sixteenth from home, but failed to keep pace with an outer rival
for that position late. UNDER THE GUN pressed outside of the leader early on, but failed to keep pace with nine sixteenths pole, chased while proving no
match entering the lane, but tired in the final furlong, and faltered after losing place at the sixteenth pole. TOP SECRET broke a step slowly, lacked speed in
the three path, and moved up between horses. WAR ROOM tracked three wide, but chased on his left lead in upper stretch before being pinched among
foes at the furlong grounds. MR. YASUDA stumbled at the start, trailed in the four path, and made little impact. MAYAN chased along the inside, but
weakened through the lane.

LEGIONNAIRE tracked along the inside, loomed a danger while inching closer turning for home, smoothly split foes while tipping outside of the leading pair
entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, led leaving the furlong grounds, and drove clear. BEN DIESEL pressed two wide, vied around the turn, dueled
between horses in upper stretch after an outer rival bid, got outkicked by that foe in midstretch, and kept on to prevail for place. CLASSIC MOMENT set the
pace inside of a vying rival around the turn, but failed to resist an outer rival's bid leaving the furlong grounds, and yielded. MINNESOTA READY laid off of
the pace in the three path, fanned to the five path entering the lane, and chased the top trio home. POLICY OPTION broke a step slow, raced far back in the
three to five paths around the turn, and failed to factor. HIPPODROME stalked three wide, but yielded while being floated four wide entering the lane, and
faded. GRANTHAM stalked in the two path, but failed to keep pace entering the turn, and weakened between horses at the three furlong pole. BOURBON
THUNDER was off a beat slow, and got outrun.
