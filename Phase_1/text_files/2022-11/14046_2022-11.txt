Footnotes
JOY IN THE BATTLE dueled from the two path through the opening half mile, led the way while saving ground around the far turn and drew off down the
lane. PRANCE trailed the field on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path passing the three eighths pole
and improved position in the stretch. A THOUSAND DREAMS saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run
up the backstretch, came around the second bend in the two path and finished evenly. LEXOPHILIA hit the gate leaving it, saved ground in the early going,
raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and made no bid. METAROSE saved ground around the first
turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch and faded from there. QUEENS RANSOM tracked the leaders from the two path around the first turn and up
the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the far turn and tired further in the stretch.

Footnotes
OUR VALLEY brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around
the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and got up for the win in the final strides. BOURBON AND WATER chased the front runner on the inside
through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the three path and gained ground late to just miss. SEAFARING WILDCAT led the way up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and dueled gamely in the lane, giving way late. NUMMY NUM brushed with the horse to his inside at the start,
raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, came around the turn in the four path and finished evenly. HUNTER JUMPER raced off the
pace up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and came up empty in the stretch. GABE'S MONSTER raced at the back of the pack on the
outside through the opening stages, angled in to save ground around the turn and made no bid. LIL LADY raced at the back of the pack on the inside up the
backstretch and around the turn and was never a factor.

turn and held that margin to the wire. CASHANOVA saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the
backstretch, continued to save ground around the second bend and gained ground in late stretch. MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) raced in the two path
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, angled in to save ground around the far turn and improved
position through the final furlong. THICK HAZE trailed the field from the three path through the opening half mile, offered a mild bid coming around the far
turn and flattened out in the lane. VINTAGE KITTEN pressed the pace from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to drop back
coming around the second bend and faded further from there.

Footnotes
BANDON BRIDGE tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole,
gained ground and pulled clear in the final furlong. SQUARE FOOTAGE opened up to a clear early lead while racing up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn, was caught in upper stretch and chased on to the wire. WAY TO FIRE chased the frontrunner on the inside up the backstretch, came
around the turn in the three path, switched to the inside entering the stretch and kept on to the finish. BARBARIUS raced in the middle of the pack on the
inside early, saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and was outkicked in the final furlong. LADY COMMISH raced off the
pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and never threatened. FULLY COMPLIANT bumped with the horse to his outside
leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the two path and was empty
from there. WHO B DAT trailed the field up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two and three path and made no bid. TALKINGNONSTOP bumped
with the horse to his inside at the start, raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, came around the turn in the three and four path, swung wider
still entering the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
FAST TO FORTUNE led the field while saving ground around the first turn, opened up racing inside up the backstretch and around the second bend and
held off a late closer to the wire. FAT AND FURIOUS bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, saved ground around the first turn, settled in the
middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and gained ground steadily down the stretch. AKASI
saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, came around the far turn in the two path and gained
ground late. TOP REFERENCES stalked the leader from the two path through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn still in the two path and
weakened in the final furlong. EASY DOES IT trailed the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, raced in the two path around
the turn and passed tiring horses in the lane. DRAMADORA saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, dropped back from
the rail coming around the second bend and tired further from there. PAGODA RIDGE bumped with the horse to his inside at the break, settled at the back
of the pack in the early going, saved ground around the far turn and made no bid. LIP'S OF WINE raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up
the backstretch off the pace on the outside, swung out to the five path entering the stretch and was empty from there.
