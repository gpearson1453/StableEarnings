SNOWY JUBA CAT was hustled to the front leaving the chute and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole and dug in under steady
stretch handling to hold on well. FANCY HER UP gave close chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail, dug in to maintain second but
flattened late. ELLIES LIL CASTLE chased through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn, drifted into the stretch but finished evenly while gaining
on the runner-up. THELADYISTRUE chased, rounded the turn about the four path and finished evenly outside. JUBA'S HOUSE gave early chase toward
mid track, raced in the three path on the turn then weakened. SUPERSTASIA was not a factor. BALLYMENA lacked speed.

POLITICAL DECISION stalked inside, bid nearing the quarter pole and raced at the rail through the turn, eased out at the eighth pole and dug in under
steady handling to take over the final yards. GOT FLOFFY tapered in and rated a short lead, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, dug in at
the rail through the far turn but was caught in the final yards. SILVER R was bumped inward and into Runner leaving the gate then saved ground racing well
back, bid from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, angled out and made contact with MAKE THE WAY CLEAR at the top of the stretch,
dug in from there and dueled clear in third later yards. The latter stalked off the rail, challenged toward the three eighths pole, raced close in the three path
of the far turn but was bumped outward at the eighth pole and flattened the final sixteenth. TAPIT TO THE WIRE rounded the opening turn about the four
path, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the five path then flattened in the lane. RUNNER was bumped at
the break, rounded the opening turn about the three path and showed little response. DAKOTA BOY broke inward and made contact with Silver then settled
in the three path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the five path of the far turn. GOLD GUY was pulled up shortly
after the start and walked off post race. The Stewards reviewed the incident at the top of the stretch but took no action.

rounded the far turn in the five path and dug in through the stretch to get up the final strides. HOT FUDGE SONDE saved ground close to the pace on the
first turn then eased out with a bid into the backstretch, took the nod three wide midway on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch handling, drew briefly
clear mid-stretch but was nipped in the final strides. C R'S UNCLE LINO settled in the three path the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn about the four path and finished well to take third the final yards. PENGUIN PARADE stalked two deep, challenged toward the three
eighths pole and dueled to a brief slim lead toward the five sixteenths pole, was caught between horses midway on the far turn and flattened late stretch.
EPIC TIME rated a short lead inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was met nearing the five sixteenths, raced at a close
disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn but weakened inside the sixteenth pole. NOBALLSTWOSTRIKES stalked three wide into the first turn, picked
