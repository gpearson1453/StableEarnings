Footnotes
THEBACKSTRETCHDUDE showed good speed to dictate the pace at the half, repelled a brief outside challenge running on the turn, opened up on the field
at the top of the stretch and cruised home for a comfortable victory. KINETIC STONE pressed the issue in the early part, was on hold inside lacking room at
the seven sixteenths pole, had to tap on the brakes again midway through the turn on the rail, slipped up the fence at the quarter pole and chased the
winner in vain through the stretch. SILENT MIRACLE had a sluggish beginning hitting the gate at the start, trailed the pack down the backside, took closer
order to the field entering the turn, rallied splitting rivals at the top of the lane and put in a good finish the final eighth gaining on the leaders in deep stretch.
DANCIN' DEPUTY was off slow at the break, recovered to settle in midfield inside at the half mile marker, waited briefly behind foes on the turn, two
furlongs from home was ridden for more and finished through the lane one paced to garner a small share. FIELD HOCKEY tracked the frontrunning winner
just outside down the backstretch, was roused two wide midpoint on the turn to offer a mild bid, gave way at the quarter pole and faltered between horses at
the furlong marker. CANDY STREET travelled near the rear in the beginning stages, advanced mildly three wide into the turn, shifted out in the four path
turning for home and made no impression racing to the wire.

Footnotes
GUNGI bumped with a rival in the early going, stalked the pace from outside, advanced three wide on the turn, took the lead past the quarter pole, was
asked for more, kicked clear and lasted from a fast-closing GIVE ME MY MONEY, who was in a hair tight at the start, settled at the rear shifting in and
saving ground on the turn, swung seven wide turning for home and asked for run, still had much to do a furlong out but was flying late to narrowly miss.
MIA'S LIL ANGEL brushed the gate lightly, advanced outside four to five wide on the turn, drifted in once in the stretch and within striking distance, evened
out and could not kick on but secured show. DEFOGGER saved ground settling inside off the leaders, came out in the stretch and ran on. WILD
CONVERSATION set the pace racing on or just off the rail, steadily weakened once headed. BEYOND TALENTED was in a bit tight past the half, saved
ground and ran on. AURA OF GOLD was encouraged along three to four wide on the turn, came out seven wide for the drive, failed to rally. TAYBO
bumped with a rival early, chased briefly two to three wide, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
FLOWERS 'N BERRIES was relaxed tracking in midfield alone at the half mile pole, waited on the rail patiently through the turn, shot up the fence in upper
stretch to lead by the eighth pole and drew away nicely in the end. CELTIC REVIVAL was hustled early to get the lead between rivals after the break, set
the pace while unchallenged on the turn, offered no resistance when collared inside by the winner in mid stretch and was tiring late but held for the place
share at the wire. SPEEDY ESSA was situated in the middle of the pack running down the backstretch, was ridden to keep pace with an outside runner at
the three eighths pole, angled five wide for the stretch drive and had good late energy finishing well to make it close for place at the line. MISS MOLLY
LALOU settled near the back of the pack with a half left to run, began to find her stride at the quarter pole shifting out to the six path turning for home and
closed well with intent to settle on the fringes at the finish. TAKE CHANCES was unhurried early trailing at the half, save ground racing at the back on the
turn, angled out five wide for the stretch run and passed tired runners through the lane. VELIKIY chased the pace in the second flight into the turn, closed in
on the pacesetting leader at the quarter marker, contended four wide at the top of the lane and faded between rivals with a furlong remaining. I'LL BE ME
hopped at the break trailing early, was hustled to keep pace with the field racing down the backstretch, on the turn was asked for more run and could not get
involved in the stretch drive. FABULEUX AT DAWN tracked while well in hand into the turn, was urged between horses two furlongs from the finish and
folded in mid stretch inside. RASHIDA travelled in the middle of the field three deep early on in a spread out field, put in a brief turn of foot outside midway
on the turn, gave way at the top of the stretch and faded through the lane.

Footnotes
NOT SO QUIET raced behind off the leading pair stalking solo while off the rail, tipped out four wide past the midpoint of the turn, struck the lead past the
three-sixteenths in upper stretch, edged clear under steady handling. ELEKTRONIC was coaxed forward at the start, pressed the pace from outside three
wide, took over past the quarter pole but was soon tackled by an outside rival, kept on to hold second. EMBOLDEN settled inside foes off the pace, came
out three wide turning for home, moved back in a bit after passing outside tiring rivals in upper stretch, got along the inside just off the leaders and evened
out while just holding show honors. SANDY BAY shifted in heading up the backstretch, raced at the back outside a rival two to three wide on the turn, came
out a bit for the drive, was gaining late and just missed third. MAAKWA raced toward the back off the inside going three wide into the turn, shifted in about
upper stretch, advanced inside tiring rivals then altered out nearing the sixteenth pole but was in behind rivals late and finished willingly. MR CROWLEY
saved ground on the turn, came out in the stretch, failed to menace. FEELTHEBEAT was in a bit tight early, was between runners two to three wide into the
turn, floated four to five wide into the stretch and weakened. AIM FOR THE SKY bobbled at the start, steadied on heels slightly in the early going, went four
to five wide on the turn drifting seven deep into the stretch, failed to threaten. ABISKO was hard to load, moved forward to set the pace racing just off the rail
with outside pressure, came up empty. VICTORIOUS WAVE was outside foes five wide on the turn and failed to rally.

Footnotes
STOP THE HUMBUG was allowed to settle trailing the field in the early stages of the race, continued at the rear running down the backside, circled foes
four wide full of run at the three eighths pole, had dead aim on the leader at the top of the lane and wore down the frontrunner late edging away at the wire.
MAD DOG N JOE took command inside right after start, set the fractions racing down the backstretch, opened up on the field again while in hand at the
quarter pole, fought on stubbornly trying to hold off the closing winner and mid stretch and gave way very late. MAYITO tracked the loose leader with
runners on either side in the second flight entering the far turn, was shuffled between foes losing ground at the three furlong marker, regrouped inside two
furlongs from the wire, rallied up the fence in mid stretch and closed well to capture third money. TOURIST'S DREAM broke out at the start, settled in the
middle of the pack alone with a half mile left to go, advanced outside three wide midway on the far turn, could not match strides with the closing winner at
the quarter pole when asked and raced evenly through the lane. PHIL IN ECHO settled on the rail in midfield halfway through the race, slipped up the fence
running on the far turn, shifted out four wide for the drive to be in the mix for a share of the prize and stalled between rivals at the furlong marker. MR.
AGRO was reined in while three wide into the first turn to save ground, stalked near the back of the field with a half remaining, offered a mild run three wide
at the three eighths marker, angled five wide for the drive and could not be a factor running to the wire. BROKE AN BROKEN tracked inside running down
the backstretch, was roused to go after the leader on the far turn, could not close the gap at the quarter pole and had nothing left for the drive stopping at
the eighth pole. WINGS OF VICTORY chased the frontrunner going five wide outside foes on the first turn, continued to track the pacesetter down the
backside, gave way between horses midpoint of the second turn, stopped at the top of the stretch and was not persevered with while crossing the finish.

Footnotes
O WOW was urged at the break, gained forward position tracking in behind near the inside, came out late on the turn and was three wide when making a
bid in upper stretch, led outside the eighth pole and drew clear under stout urging. WORRY LESS broke inwardly, was coaxed forward to set the pace and
quickly moved clear, dictated terms on or just off the rail, was overtaken in upper stretch and no match but second best. CRIMSON NIGHTS broke sharply
but ceded the lead, was up close early stalking from outside three wide, could not kick on with the top pair but kept on well enough to hold show honors.
TELLTALE broke a step slowly, went three to four wide on the turn, came into upper stretch five wide and improved position from between runners then
saved the minor award. SNOW LAKE raced mid-pack just outside two to three wide, ran on evenly and missed the minor award. JO MARCH was outside
four to five wide on the turn coming six deep into upper stretch, ran on mildly. MISS WATERLOO trailed early racing well back, came out four wide turning
for upper stretch and asked for run just past the quarter pole, had no real response and failed to rally. SERENADE BAY was in a bit tight at the start, saved
ground but was unable to menace. PRIVILEGED was mid-pack briefly in the early going, dropped back four to five wide.

Footnotes
BREEZE EASY (GB) had a good spot tracking the speed leader three eighths to the finish, waited for running room through the turn, angled out five wide to
bid in upper stretch, took command at the eighth pole and held on narrowly winning the nod at the wire. TRADING BAY was unhurried early to be near the
rear down the backside, could see the field racing on the turn, began to pick up runners angling out in the nine path turning for home and was full of run
through the lane just missing out on the victory losing the close photo in the end. A GAME was on the rail in a stalking position in the third flight down the
backside, two furlongs from the line was urged three wide to go on, found her best stride in the three path gaining late but could not get there in time and
was on the losing end of a three horse photo for the win. INTO TOURING waited throughout the turn looking for room on the rail, began to rally on the fence
having a clear path in upper stretch but needed more late to threaten the leaders at the finish line. DIAMOND CRUSH was void of early speed trailing down
the backstretch, took closer order to be in the stalking pack into the turn, angled eight wide at the top of the stretch and showed good late energy to close
well the final eighth. SOUPER PECAN travelled inside near the back at the half, saved ground on the rail through the turn and passed tired runners
advancing up the fence down the lane. SPANISH BEAUTY broke sharp and showed speed setting the fractions in the beginning, was collared outside
racing four wide turning for home, battled on nearing the sixteenth pole and tired in deep stretch. I HAVE AN IDEA advanced between runners entering the
turn, continued to keep pace with challengers at the quarter pole, was in with a chance for a small share in upper stretch but could not quicken with rivals
late to be involved. OL' BLONDIE travelled in the middle of the field on the turn, was asked four wide at the quarter pole, travelled in the eighth path turning
for home and made little impact running to the wire. CHOCOLATEADDICTION chased the frontrunner on the turn, tried to keep position under a drive five
sixteenths from the finish, was in range six wide in upper stretch and came up empty for the run in the final eihth. GIZMO'S B F F stalked outside in the third
flight with four furlongs to go, was roused midturn, offered little response and faltered between horses at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
CANDY OVERLOAD was bumped at the break, settled toward the rear, raced outside a foe three then four wide on the turn, fanned eight wide into upper
stretch, took aim and drove past inside the final sixteenth. ICE CHOCOLAT (BRZ) raced outside the second flight four wide into the turn, came into upper
stretch five wide, bid nearing the sixteenth pole, put a short head in front briefly but was outfinished. LUCKY SCORE settled at the rear, fanned ten wide into
the stretch, was gaining but too late. SILENT POET broke sharply, moved clear early to dictate terms, was joined by an outside foe, dueled from about the
seven-sixteenths to the three-sixteenths, reasserted command till mid-stretch then was outkicked. RED RIVER REBEL was forced in at the start and
bumped a rival, moved forward up the backstretch, went three to four wide on the turn, altered out in upper stretch for room and kept on. ROARING
FORTIES settled well back racing about two to three wide, fanned seven wide into the stretch racing inside the eventual winner, switched outside that one
nearing mid-stretch, kept on but needed more. STRIKER broke inwardly, raced two to three wide mid-pack into the turn, came out nearing the eighth pole,
needed more. SECRET RESERVE raced between foes in the second flight two to three wide on the turn, failed to rally. ARZAK moved forward to press
three wide, forced the issue dueling outside from about the seven-sixteenths to the top of the stretch, faded. MASON'S GAMBLE saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
JUST START ME UP took command at the start, led the field uncontested down the backside, was coaxed for more two furlongs from the wire, found
another gear to open up in mid stretch and held well at the finish. NONNO'S LITTLE BOY commenced his run on the fence three furlongs from the finish,
rallied up the rail turning for home, was brushed by a tiring outside rival in upper stretch and chased the winner in vain through the lane besting the rest in
the end. STOLEN MONEY chased the winner in the second flight outside into the second turn, was scrubbed on for more run at the five sixteenths pole,
contended in the three path in upper stretch and ran on well to settle for a clear third. BET N WIN threw his head at the start to be near the back in the early
stages, was allowed to find his feet down the backside,, began to rally three wide three furlongs out, travelled widest in the seven path turning for home and
showed interest in the stretch to close well for the minors. WHERE'S NEAL was allowed to settle near the back all alone at the half mile marker, offered a
mild rally splitting foes at the quarter marker and was one paced in the five path down the stretch. OCTOBER FROST trailed the field inside on the far turn,
could see them all at the top of the lane and passed weary rivals running to the wire. MORE THAN A DANCE settled in the middle of the field three wide at
the half, was roused three wide two furlongs from the prize, shifted out to be six wide for the drive and faded in the stretch. BLAST IN THE SNOW tracked
on the rail into the first turn, sat behind the loose pacesetter through the backside, was ridden to go after frontrunner on the far turn, could not keep up, gave
way between foes in upper stretch while brushing his inside rival, was steadied briefly when stopping at the eighth pole and galloped across the line.

Footnotes
RACING IN THE RAIN dueled for the front between rivals down the backside, held a slight advantage midway on the turn and battled the eventual place
finisher down the lane to persevere late. ROMANTIC GAMBLE pressed the pace three wide on the backstretch and around the turn, had a brief lead in
upper stretch but was outgamed by the winner in the final stages. BODIE broke in and bumped a rival at the start, settled in the second group of three in
behind the leaders down the backside, angled out into the stretch and had dead aim on the top pair in upper stretch but could only inch up late, no threat for
the win. LUCYS CHILD settled in the second tier behind the three leading duelers, angled out into the five path in upper stretch but could only close mildly
for a minor award late. SIR GRAYVENSCROFT bumped by a rival at the start, trailed until midway on the turn and closed well into the top four by midstretch
but stalled at the seventy yard pole and lost a position late. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) nestled in along the inside behind the early leaders, steadied slightly
midturn and dropped back before re-rallying down the lane without threatening. TARA TATTOO off the pace early, came three to six wide on the turn and
passed a few down the lane while widest. SCENIC HOLIDAY three wide at the back early, came five wide late on the turn and could not muster a bid.
PRINCE SUSSEX set the pace inside two rivals before retreating midway on the turn and down the stretch. SUPER HEADLINE was four wide stalking the
top trio, roused at the three-eighths pole but retreated in the final quarter.
