Footnotes
MAGICAL LADY tracked the moderate early fractions, was roused inside of the three-furlong marker, rallied three wide in upper stretch, assumed command
in upper stretch, kept to task in the final furlong under steady urging and held over the oncoming runner-up. MISTICAL SURPRISE settled off of the early
pace, raced two then three wide nearing the quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch, closed well in the late stages, could not reel in the winner in deep
stretch and was second best in the end. COUSIN NIECEY stalked the early pace from an inside position, ran evenly to mid-stretch, encountered traffic in
mid-stretch, lacked a late rally and kept on to secure third. ENGEE OMBEE engaged with NENE ROMANO and dueled through moderate fractions with that
rival to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened. NENE ROMANO broke alertly, showed good early speed while disputing the pace
through the turn, was overtaken by MAGICAL LADY in upper stretch, chased that rival to the furlong grounds and gave way. CYCLONE SLEW lacked early
speed, saved ground through the turn, was not a factor in the stretch run and was vanned off after crossing the wire.

Footnotes
BOLD DAUGHTER tracked the moderate early fractions, raced three wide into the turn, mounted a four wide rally in upper stretch, came within aim inside of
the furlong pole, confronted TRUE COMFORT in deep stretch and produced a good late push to prevail. TRUE COMFORT was forwardly placed in the
early going, stalked the top pair along the turn while three wide, gained ground nearing mid-stretch, assumed command inside of the furlong marker, could
not hold off BOLD DAUGHTER in deep stretch and was second best in the end. DIZZY DAZMURA bobbled at the start, was hustled to contest the early
pace, pressed BEAUTYINTHEBEAST to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and held for show in the final
strides. PETE'S INFERNO chased the pace to the turn, raced three wide into the turn, swung five wide for the drive, gained ground in the final furlong and
challenged for third in the final strides. BEAUTYINTHEBEAST showed early speed and contested the moderate pace, took a narrow edge to the quarter
marker, shook free in upper stretch, could not hold off TRUE COMFORT leaving the furlong pole and faded in the final sixteenth. SEEKING ANSWERS
chased the early fractions, came three wide into the turn, slipped to the inside nearing the top of the lane and was not a late factor.

MINOSO broke alertly and showed early speed to dictate terms to the turn, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker while carving solid factions, shook
free nearing the quarter marker, was challenged late by GENTLEMAN'S SECRET and dug in in deep stretch to prevail. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET tracked
the decent early fractions while not far back, raced two to three wide on the turn, advanced in upper stretch, closed well in deep stretch to challenge
MINOSO, could not get by the determined winner in the final stages and was second best. BERNIE'S BIG BOY pressed the solid early fractions, kept
pressure on MINOSO to the quarter marker, lost ground to that rival in upper stretch, weakened in the drive and held late for third. CASH LIMIT was shuffled
back leaving the start, lacked speed to the turn, came three wide to the top of the lane and passed tiring rivals in deep stretch. CURLING SECRET tracked
the decent early pace while outside of rivals, advanced three wide on the turn, swung widest into the drive and gave way in the final furlong. ZOE'S PAPA
CEE was close up into the turn, lost ground along the rail nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace heading to mid-stretch and tired in the final
stages.

DON'T TELL HYDEE was sent to contest the early pace, took a narrow advantage to the turn, set solid fractions while pressed to the quarter marker, shook
free in upper stretch, felt late pressure from MIRACLE IN MOTION and stubbornly held that foe at bay in the final stages. MIRACLE IN MOTION showed
early speed, pressed the solid early pace, kept close attendance to DON'T TELL HYDEE to the quarter marker, lost ground to that rival in upper stretch,
closed well in the final stages, could not get by the stubborn winner in deep stretch and was second best in the end. HALF HOPING settled off of the solid
early pace, saved ground to the quarter marker, was no match for the top pair in the final sixteenth but was gaining in the late stages and was clear for third
in the end. JAYCEE raced up close to the pace heading to the turn, lost ground three wide nearing the quarter marker, was outrun in the drive and
weakened. ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) stalked the early pace, lost ground two then three wide on the turn, could not keep pace nearing mid-stretch and
gave way. MIDNIGHT SYMPHONY was washy in the post parade and prior to loading, chased the early pace, dropped back on the turn, was pulled up
inside of the quarter marker and was vanned off.

Footnotes
SATANTA was allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, improved position in upper stretch, came within aim inside of the sixteenth-marker, split
foes in deep stretch and made a late surge to get up in the final stride to prevail in a blanket finish. DIAMOND RANGER showed early speed, pressed the
quick pace to the turn, kept close attendance to FURY KAP to the quarter marker, swung three wide for the drive, lost position nearing the furlong marker,
re-rallied in deep stretch, took a slim lead in the final yards and was nailed for the win, while just holding for place. MCGEORGE settled off of the quick early
fractions, raced three wide into the turn, swung five wide for the drive, made a bold late rally inside of the furlong marker, just missed for the win and place
and was up in the final strides to secure the show. FURY KAP was hustled to the early lead, set quick fractions while pressed to the quarter marker, lost the
lead nearing the furlong grounds, stayed on to deep stretch and was edged out in a blanket finish. AFFECTIONTO AUTISM stalked the quick pace from the
inside, advanced on the turn, took a narrow lead in upper stretch, was all out inside of the furlong marker, could not hold off oncoming rivals in the final
sixteenth and was outfinished. HOLIDAY HUSTLE stalked the early pace, came two wide into the turn, swung four wide for the drive, rallied in deep stretch
and was outkicked in the final stages. CONTINENTAL UNION lacked early speed, raced two wide into the turn, swung four wide for the drive and was not a
late factor.

Footnotes
RIMPROTECTOR was allowed to settle in the early stages while not far back, saved all of the ground through the first two turns, was roused three wide
nearing the top of the lane, was full of run nearing mid-stretch, took command leaving the furlong marker and drew clear in the final stages. VANTAGE
POINT had a shoe repaired prior to the race, assumed command of the early lead leaving the break, set modest fractions while well rated, came under
pressure nearing the quarter marker, held BUENISIMO at bay nearing the furlong grounds, was overtaken by RIMPROTECTOR inside of the furlong marker
and held well in the end for place. BUENISIMO stalked the modest fractions from a two wide path, kept attendance to VANTAGE POINT to the quarter
marker, could not keep pace in upper stretch and just held for show in the final strides. HOLY GHOST was allowed to settle, raced three wide through the
first two turns, steadied entering the third turn, went four wide to the quarter marker, did not have a late kick in the stretch run and just missed for third in the
final strides. GOVENOR'S PARTY was keen early while rating off of the pace, was steered five wide into the final turn, slipped to the rail for the drive and
did not produce a late rally. BIG FLAME raced three wide while stalking the modest fractions, maintained position through the first mile, gained ground on
the third turn, could not sustain the run in the drive and gave way.

Footnotes
LAGATHA broke a step slow but was quickly into stride and opened up a clear lead, was roused passing the quarter pole and extended her lead to the wire
under intermittent urging. GAYLES EVENING broke in a bit and was quick into stride but was content to cede the early lead to LAGATHA, made a mild bid
at the top of the stretch but could not threaten the winner. KITTY'S CANDY was bothered a bit by GAYLES EVENING at the break and fell back, moved to
the inside when that one took her path, made some forward progress while saving ground to the stretch, mustered a mild rally but was unable to gain the
place. CANAM GAL was on the outside of a trio chasing the pacesetter down the backstretch, made a sweeping move on the turn, came into the stretch
three-wide and finished evenly while never a threat. SEN SEN bumped twice by LAGATHA after the break, then had to check when that one took her path,
recovered, moved up to race between horses chasing the leader down the backstretch, remained prominent to the top of the stretch then flattened out.

Footnotes
SALLY'S SASSY rated off the fast early pace, was well positioned on the turn while three wide, mounted a four wide rally in upper stretch, came within aim
nearing the furlong marker, closed well inside of the furlong grounds, matched strides with ALWAYS AT EASE in the final yards and determinedly won the
head nod on the wire. ALWAYS AT EASE was a bit slow into early stride, was unhurried through fast early fractions while saving ground, was roused three
wide nearing the quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive, came within aim in mid-stretch, closed fast in the late stages, matched strides with SALLY'S
SASSY in the final yards and gamely missed for the win, while getting up to secure the place. ROUSING JEWEL was forwardly placed in the early stages,
tracked the pace three deep into the turn, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, assumed command in upper stretch and extended the lead nearing the
furlong marker, raced on the left lead in deep stretch, was all out in the final sixteenth and was tagged in the final strides by the top pair, while clear in the
end for show. MAJESTIC OOPS raced in the second flight while settling off of the fast early pace, saved ground on the turn, advanced in upper stretch and
offered a mild late rally while unable to impact the leaders. IMAGINARY was prominent in the early going, stalked the fast pace two wide into the turn, lost
ground nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly while chasing to mid-stretch and lacked a late response. BET DE VRON was squeezed and shuffled back at
the start, chased from the rear to the turn, came two wide into the turn, swung four wide for the drive, came in tight in mid-stretch and did not threaten in the
final stages. JUANA GALLO was hustled to contest the early lead, dueled with KETANJI through quick fractions nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken
in upper stretch, chased to the furlong grounds and faded late. KETANJI broke alertly, showed good early speed while contesting the fast fractions, dueled
for pace duties to the quarter marker, could not keep pace leaving the turn and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
SUNNY SPOT got of a bit slow when squeezed at the break, moved over to the rail, moved forward along the rail while under a strong hold, steadied
repeatedly on the first turn and remained under restraint down the backstretch, was boxed in through the far turn, moved out to the three path for the stretch
run and commenced a strong rally, holding off a determined foe at the wire. MORE POWER TO HIM saved ground behind the leading trio into the
clubhouse turn, was last past the quarter pole, found a seam turning for home, responded to strong handling, rallied while racing on the wrong lead for most
of the stretch and just missed. MAGIC TIGER was a bit fractious in the gate, lacked early foot, made steady forward progress down the backside and into
the turn, launched a four wide bid turning for home and was slowly gaining on the top two without being a serious threat. SUGAR BEETS broke well and
was among the leaders into the first turn, stalked the leader to the far turn, moved to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, battled with AUTISMS
WORLD for a furlong, put that one away in the final sixteenth but had nothing left to fend off oncoming rivals. AUTISMS WORLD was pushed for early
speed and let the field into the first turn, met the challenge of SUGAR BEETS at the quarter pole, ran on gamely but gave way in the late stages. BROKEN
FINGER hustled from the break, got into good forward position but was hung three wide on the first turn, was prominent to top of the stretch while still wide,
lacked clear running room turning for home, angled to the inside and was outrun the rest of the way.
