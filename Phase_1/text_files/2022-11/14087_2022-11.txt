SHENANDOAH CAT set a pressured pace, widened at the rail on the turn and was kept alert through the stretch. DIVA ROSE pressured the winner through
the backstretch, dropped back off the rail approaching the quarter pole, proved no match in the lane but held well for second. REAL APPEAL chased
through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path and finished evenly to take third inside the sixteenth pole. POWER SONDE chased the early
pace, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened in the lane. PETTYFORURTHOUGHTS gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn and showed little in the
lane. WAGER WORTHY gave close early chase inside but steadied at the rail past the five sixteenths pole. CEDAR RUN'S FIRE was not a factor.

HOVEL settled in the two and three paths the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, drew to even terms two deep midway on the far turn and dug
in through the stretch to take the nod in the final strides. COWGIRL SHINE stalked three wide then took over approaching the seven sixteenths pole, turned
back Blue Agave approaching the quarter pole but picked up the challenge of Hovel midway on the far turn, dug in gamely from that point but relented the
final strides. CONCERT HALL saved ground well off the pace, bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the five path of the far turn and
cleared third mid-stretch. GOLDEN SALLY rated close inside on the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase nearing the three eighths pole,
raced in the three path of the far turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. TOUGH GAME rounded the first turn in the four path and left the turn outside, bid
toward the three eighths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. SUPER WICKED exchanged contact with BEAUTIFUL
MICHELLE leaving the gate then stalked, dueled between horses from the half mile pole but dropped back at the five sixteenths and faded on the far turn.
The latter exchanged contact with Super Wicked leaving the gate, raced well back and never factored. EMPTY ENVELOPE rounded the opening turn about
the four path and never factored. BLUE AGAVE rated a slim lead from the five eighths pole, was met into the backstretch and dueled from that point, then
faded at the rail on the far turn.

ONE NIGHT MIKE checked in tight off the inside flank of Change Your Luck past the five eighths pole then eased out to stalk that one, challenged nearing
the three eighths pole, moved to even terms at the five sixteenths and took the edge toward the quarter, then dug in under steady handling to hold off the
late challenge of PERSONABLE, who rounded the first turn about the five path and left the turn outside, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
raced through far turn in the three path then dug in down the lane to hold second. WELL EQUIPPED became fractious in the gate then saved ground on the
first turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail into the far turn, eased outward nearing the top of the lane, finished well to take
third later yards and was gaining on the runner-up. JAXJAXXORJACKS saved ground off the pace, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and entered
the far turn near the rail, steadied in tight at the rail mid-stretch and flattened stride later yards. TIMMY rounded the opening turn in the four path, picked up
the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three path but showed little more. CHANGE YOUR LUCK tapered to the inside
and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, was met at the five sixteenths, gave up the advantage toward the quarter,
continued close at the rail on the far turn then weakened the final furlong. BRIGHT DAWN settled back off the rail on the opening turn and showed little
response through the backstretch.

THUNDERINREADYRICK raced with the pace thee wide through the front stretch then took over past the five eighths pole, was urged away from the three
eighths, widened at the rail on the far turn then steadily handled through the lane. HILLBILLY ROCK raced with the early pace inside then stalked from the
five eighths pole, picked up the chase leaving the half pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and finished well while gaining on the winner. SUGAR LIPS
settled off the rail on the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and
finished well. ROCKET J. saved ground off the pace, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane.
SIENTE EL AMOR saved ground, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened inside the eighth pole.
ORANGEBURG rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn then weakened.
ROCKING TO HOME raced with the early pace but dropped back from between horses midway on the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch and
weakened past the five sixteenths pole. FOOL FOR THE CITY rounded the first turn in the five path and was not a factor.
