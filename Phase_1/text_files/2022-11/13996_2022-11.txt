Footnotes
GOLD CHAIN unhurried in the beginning, moved up, racing four wide around the turn, rallied down the lane and drove clear before the wire. TENPINS
TEMPEST pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match late for the winner, but held on for second. SLOOPY HANG ON raced within
contention, made a late bid and was outfinished for second. CHATAIN'S EAGLE lacked early speed, made a late wide gain and finished willingly. DON'T
BLINK TWICE raced within striking distance, came around the turn on the outside and weakened. CUSTOMS BELLA ELLA void of early speed and was
never a factor. LOT'SA SILVER broke a step slow, quickly rushed up, took the lead, saved ground around the turn and was finished early.

Footnotes
TAPIT'S LADY pressed the pace, challenged on the front end throughout, dueled down the home stretch and prevailed for the win. TRINITY HOPE
unhurried in the beginning, racing in the middle of the pack, moved up on the inside around the second turn, angled out down the lane and was outfinished
for the win. TABLE ONE void of early speed, racing in the back, saved ground around the final turn, angled out down the stretch, gained ground and finished
gamely. MONGOLIAN DIAMOND dueled on the front end, saved ground and weakened down the home stretch. LAST DESTINY raced within striking
distance and lacked a late kick. LA JAZZ showed early speed and faded. VANCOUVER SNOW raced evenly near the back and was never a factor.
ARCTIC GUITAR raced in the middle of the field, dropped back and was no threat late. AUNT JANA always raced near the back and showed little. BABY
MAYBE had an awkward start, raced outside around the first turn and was never a threat.

Footnotes
TRUE RED SLEW vied for the early lead, drove clear down the home stretch and held on well for the win. WOO HOO challenged on the front end, raced
close throughout, proved no match late for the winner, but was best of others. CAMCORDIA raced near the back in the early going, made a steady gain, but
proved no match for the top two. MAVE RUNNER pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a finish. CABO SUNSET void of early
speed and passed tired ones. MY LITTLE GUERA raced within striking distance, steadied down the backside, getting blocked, finished evenly and was no
threat late. T J'S SUNSHINE raced evenly near the back and showed little. THURSDAY MORNING raced within contention, had an outside trip and
retreated. MY AVANI raced in the middle of the field, came around the second turn on the outside and dropped back.
