WHERETHEMONEYWENT was unhurried while off the inside into the far turn, advanced through the three path, came into the lane from the five path,
gained momentum after straightening in the lane and finished with good energy from the four path to be up in time. MOMOS HUMOR set the pace along the
inside, was put under pressure through the turn and into the lane, was bumped solidly near the eighth pole, regrouped, led late and was outfinished.
CECILIA'S HOPE pressed then dueled with the runner-up through the turn and into the lane, stepped in and bumped rival near the eighth pole then yielded.
MAJESTIC CLIMB chased the pace from the three path through the turn when never far back, entered the lane from the three path and lacked a closing
response. KHOZYS CROWN was along the inside through the turn, came off the rail inside the eighth pole and never was a threat while ending in the three
path at the wire. TENAKEE losing ground throughout while near the inside.

Footnotes
S S TROOPER set the pace while on a clear lead from the outset, continued on a clear lead through the far turn and into the lane and was never threatened
to the end. MAJOR SPARKS was unhurried while off the rail through the far turn, came into the lane from the five path and rallied in mid-track for the place
spot. GREY STREAK chased the pace from the two path through the far turn, bid into the lane from the three path, could not gain on the leader and lost the
place spot late. SLIABH AUGHTY (FR) raced near the rail through the turns, came into the lane as a threat while having aim on the top two then could not
gain. STEWARDS RULES never a factor while saving ground into the lane. LORD REVELSTOKE raced in the four path through the far turns, bid into the
lane and faded. EXPRESSED was steadied in the first turn to settle to last, raced in the two or three path through the far turn while never a factor.
FREDERICKTOWN raced in the four path through the first turn, continued well off the inside through the far turn and tired entering the lane. NAUGHTY
NELLIE chased the pace from the three path into the turn and was suddenly done in mid-turn. Quarter time was omitted due to a timer malfunction.
