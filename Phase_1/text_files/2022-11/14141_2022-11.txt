Footnotes
ROCK THE BOURBON broke in and bumped BEACHGRASS, angled to the inside then became rank traying to rate early, remained under a hold up the
backstretch, went around a rival on the far turn then angled back to the inside, rallied inside the leader and took over with a sixteenth to go and won going
away. ICE QUEEN sped to the front and moved inside, set the pace under pressure in the middle stages, shook free at the quarter pole, challenged from
inside in midstretch, lost command at the sixteenth pole and kept on for a clear second. BEACHGRASS got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, steered
to the inside while unhurried at the back, went outside a rival on the backstretch, angled out on the far turn and came five wide into the lane and rallied to
get up for third. CONSTERNATION (IRE) settled in the two path, angled four wide on the far turn, showed a mild response to urging but lost the show.
FRAZZLED brushed leaving the gate, became rank early when rated, chased outside a rival then came three wide into the stretch and lacked further
response. NOBLE HEARTED was up close early two to three wide along the clubhouse turn then went up to press the pace from outside, lost touch with the
leader near the quarter pole and faded in the stretch run. SHEMAKESCENTS stalked the pace on the inside, lost ground on the backstretch, started to
weaken on the far turn and trailed into the stretch and had little left in the lane.

Footnotes
CONCH DADDY broke out then went up to take control, set the pace between rivals then cleared into the turn, led in the two path through the bend and into
the stretch, met the bid from DEVIL MOON in midstretch and gamely prevailed. DEVIL MOON broke through the gate and had to be reloaded, pressed the
issue early then chased the leader into the turn, came again with a rail bid in midstretch but could not get by. U R PRESSED broke out, was forwardly
placed four deep early then chased three deep around the turn, continued to take aim from outside through the lane but lacked the needed late kick. CURLY
ESA broke out then raced up close outside the leader three deep, chased between around the bend, lost ground and came four wide into the stretch and
weakened in the lane while drifting out slightly. MEMORANDUM settled on the inside, angled out widest around the bend, came six wide into the stretch and
could not rally. FROST ALERT bothered leaving the gate, raced in range early, entered the turn two wide, moved out and exited the bend five wide, chased
between rivals in the lane but also lacked a rally. SHADY STAR was off very slow to begin and was not persevered with. BOBS BLUES MAN lost his path
early then went wrong past the half-mile pole, eased leaving the backstretch and pulled up on the turn and walked into the van.

Footnotes
CAROLE LOMBARD broke in and bumped, stalked two wide outside a rival, tipped out on the far turn while gaining, bid three deep into the stretch, brushed
with LOYAL TO A FAULT while taking over, kicked clear past the eighth pole and drew away. LOYAL TO A FAULT was closest in pursuit of the leader to
the far turn, reeled in SWEET HELLO and drew alongside leaving the bend, took over briefly at the top of the lane, brushed with and was overtaken by
CAROLE LOMBARD shortly after and chased the winner through the furlong grounds for a clear second. MOOREA TIME stalked the pace on the inside,
tipped out in upper stretch and was given her cue, could not summon the needed response but kept on to secure the show. POINT AND SHOOT was off a
bit slow then took back to avoid a shuffle early, raced along the inside then moved outside a rival, angled out then back in on the far turn, tried to go inside
then steered out in the lane and missed the show. VIOLET CROWN unhurried in the two path, came three wide into the lane, moved out in the stretch and
lacked a rally. VACANT SEAT settled in the two path then moved to the rail, continued along the inside then two wide into the lane, got floated out
midstretch, and failed to menace. SWEET HELLO took a bump from outside to begin, went up to take control and moved clear, padded the lead in the
middle stages, held a diminishing lead around the far turn and was collared entering the stretch, failed to offer any resistance and folded in the lane.
SMOOVE AS SILK trailed two wide early then moved inside, saved ground to the lane, found traffic in upper stretch then shifted to the inside, could not get
through when put in tight and checked midstretch and could not regain momentum.

Footnotes
GET HER NUMBER dropped back early, made steady progress splitting foes then angled four wide around the bend, drew alongside past the sixteenth pole
and got up at the wire. GINOBILI was closest in pursuit three wide into the turn, moved into the two path around the bend, bid outside with a quarter mile
remaining, took over in the furlong grounds while battling FORBIDDEN KINGDOM but got nailed by GET HER NUMBER at the wire. FORBIDDEN
KINGDOM sped clear and crossed over, led two wide then moved to the inside, challenged at the quarter pole, fought back and carried a narrow lead into
the final furlong, lost command soon after but finished gamely to the wire. HOWBEIT broke a bit slow and lost his path at the start, chased three deep into
the turn, entered the lane five wide and lacked a late bid. RISK AND REWARD saved ground through the turn, steered out in the lane and never threatened.
NERO settled inside, trailed two wide into the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ICY FLAVOR shifted in and bumped WYFIRE at the start, dueled briefly then cleared inner rival, showed the way along the rail through the turn and into the
stretch, met the challenge from WYFIRE at the quarter pole, shook free past the eighth pole under left handed urging and drew away. WYFIRE shifted in
and bumped rival then got bumped from outside shortly after that, stalked three deep, launched a bid from outside around the turn, flanked the leader into
the final furlong but could not keep up in the furlong grounds and had to settle for second best. UNCLE GEORGE bumped leaving the gate, moved into
range three deep, continued three wide into the stretch and held the show. GEORGE HERMAN RUTH raced two wide near the back into the turn, angled
out and came four wide into the lane and could not pass UNCLE GEORGE for third. SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS showed early speed then ceded to
command while keen up the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch and flattened in the lane. QUEEN'S CODE bumped leaving the gate, chased while
keen between rivals early on, went two wide around the bend, found traffic behind rivals in upper stretch, gained an opening midstretch but could not rally.
DAMAZIO bumped at the start, trailed early on, shifted out into the turn, angled down to the rail around the bend, steered out in the lane and failed to rally.
BLAME GEORGE stalked the speed from inside, steadied briefly at the five-sixteenths pole, swung out into the lane, then moved out further and came up
empty. HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
NIGHT PARTY stepped the front quickly, showed the way up the backstretch, met the bid from HOT THOUGHTS at the five-sixteenths pole, disposed of
that rival with a quarter mile left to run, then drew off while drifting to the inside and was in hand late. SPEAKING SPANGLISH chased four deep at the back
early, went four then three wide around the turn, rallied in the drive and edged HOT THOUGHTS for second. HOT THOUGHTS stumbled leaving the gate,
recovered and went up to be forward placed, bid outside the winner at the five-sixteenths pole, could not sustain the challenge approaching the quarter pole,
chased three wide into the lane and lost the show. TIME TOGETHER raced up close from inside early, chased around the turn and was asked right handed
leaving the bend but weakened down the lane. ROSIE ANN RULES tracked two to three wide into the lane and never responded to urging. WINK WISH
AND PARK was off a bit slow to begin, chased inside a trio of rivals then had to check near the three-eighths pole, continued on the fence through the turn
and was not a factor. GYPSY ROSIE chased three deep at the back early, steadied at the seven-sixteenths pole, faded around the turn and exited the bend
three wide and tired.

Footnotes
PHENOM set the pace under pressure from outside, cleared around the turn and held safely through the final furlong. MANORELLI attended the pace three
deep early, chased the winner three then two wide into the stretch, could not make any headway in the lane but bested the rest. TOM'S BEAUTY traveled in
mid-pack early on, raced along the rail then two wide on the turn, shifted out into the stretch, bothered by READY JET GO in midstretch and altered in,
finished well in the late stages and missed second. READY JET GO raced in mid-pack outside a rival, got floated out a bit and came four wide into the
stretch, drifted in at the eight pole and got outkicked for third. ANNIE'S SONG (IRE) bumped leaving the gate, chased outside a rival near the back, rounded
the bend two wide, moved out in the lane and improved position. BABY STEPS stalked on the inside, checked off heels leaving the turn, remained inside
but could not rally. REINECKE chased on the inside then had to steady at the half-mile pole, saved ground through the turn, shifted in at the eighth pole and
could not rally. WOODBINE WAY was off slow to begin, raced two to three wide at the back on the turn, angled out in the stretch and failed to menace.
SHOPPINGFORPHAROAH pressed the pace from between rivals to the turn, chased the winner around the bend while moving to the inside and faded in
the lane. MENDHAM MILL broke a step slow, bumped and steadied at the start, trailed outside a rival, three to four wide on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
HAVNAMELTDOWN got forced out by HARD TO FIGURE early, went up to take control at the half-mile pole, held a short lead then cleared around the
bend, put to left then right handed urging in the lane and held well. NEWGATE bobbled leaving the gate, got forced out early then raced up close four deep,
chased four then three wide around the turn, finished willingly through the lane but lacked the needed late punch. PRACTICAL MOVE was off slow to begin,
chased between rivals then got forced out early, went up to press the pace three deep, could not keep up with HAVNAMELTDOWN past the five-sixteenths
pole, chased two wide into the lane and churned on for a clear third. MIXTO lost his path and had to steadied early, steered down to the inside while trailing,
angled out four wide on the turn and could not rally in the lane. HARD TO FIGURE broke alertly and stepped to the front, lugged out and became rank after
leaving the chute, lost command at the half-mile pole and pressed from inside to the turn, started to weaken around the bend and tired in the stretch run.

FIFTY CENT DOLLARS dueled for the lead from inside, inched ahead in the middle stage then vied with several rivals leaving the backstretch, shook free
late on the far turn and drew off in the final furlong. EGOMANIA stalked the pace on the inside, coaxed around the far turn while on the rail, could not
threaten the winner in the furlong grounds but bested the others. CONSTANT CONFLICT dueled four then three wide early, pressed from outside then
between rivals on the backstretch, vied for command around the far turn then lost touch past the quarter pole and was outkicked for the place honors.
SOCAL RED raced along the inside then two wide while near the back, took the second turn two then three wide, split rivals in the stretch run and kept on
for a minor award. MAYNARD got pinched back between rivals shortly after the start, chased four wide off the pace on the first turn, moved closer and bid
five deep on the backstretch, fought four wide into the stretch and flattened out in the furlong grounds. HOOP DREAM got bumped and shuffled between
rivals early, trailed four then five wide on the first turn, remained wide into the second bend, came six wide into the stretch and improved position. FIREMAN
DAN was along the three path chasing out of range on the first turn, bid four deep on the backstretch, failed to keep up around the far turn, chased five wide
into the lane and flattened. STATE OF THE UNION settled on the inside off the pace, trailed into the stretch, passed a pair of rivals but failed to menace.
STAYIN' OUT LATE had early speed inside a pair of rivals then ceded command but started to pull on the first turn, chased from between foes on the
backstretch, entered the lane two wide and faded. MIGHTY MATT bumped with inner rival early, chased four wide around the first turn, went three then four
wide on the second bend and had little left for the drive.
