Footnotes
RIDE THE RAPIDS chased the early leader while racing two to three wide and just got up in her final strides in a determined run under strong handling.
DONNA'S COURAGE hustled clear early on to set its own pace, raced clear past the eighth pole, drifted a bit late and missed in a game effort. ELLIE
VICTORINA raced off the early pace, was shuffled back near the four and half marker, angled four wide near the quarter pole and kept on willingly to the
wire. MY THIRD CHARM rated off the early pace setters, moved up between near the five sixteenths pole while racing two deep, raced from the inside.
LADY LANCER settled off the early going to race mid pack, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had no final winning bid. BALI
HAI was bobbled, bumped at the start, settled early, raced seven wide into the upper stretch and never was a serious threat. GATITA SUAVE hopped at the
start, checked while racing between nearing the half mile pole and had no response in the drive. SUNNY SPIRIT was pulled up nearing the quarter pole and
was vanned off.

Footnotes
SAVOY was sent early, rebid through the far turn while racing three wide, was eager and drew off to be well clear under a steady hand ride. ASKIN FOR A
BASKIN sent hard to vie from the inside and was match for the winner in the drive. BEN COPENHAGEN stalked the pace, raced near the inside at the
quarter pole, angled out through the stretch run and flattened out in the final stages. ROBEY'S BOY raced off the early pace, was fanned seven to eight
wide into the upper stretch and raced evenly with no late run. GONE INZANE was unhurried early, raced along the inside around the far turn and lacked a
rally. SHIRAZ was off a step slow, raced from the outside in the stretch and never threatened. HE'S A SHOOTER stalked the pace from the outside, raced
six wide near the three sixteenths pole and faded.
