Footnotes
FEROCITY chased the pace from the four path through the turn, bid in the four path into the lane, was four wide just outside the eighth pole then edged up
inside the sixteenth pole. PRINCE ACT chased the pace from the three path through the turn and into the lane then stayed on for the place spot while not a
threat to the winner. ELVIS JUST ELVIS hustled to the lead early, vied along the inside through the turn and into the lane, shook off the challenger but was
joined by others straightening in the lane then yielded to the top ones. GOLDEN TONE unhurried while in the two or three path through the turn and into the
lane then moved up while not a threat. HOLIDAY TICKET settled off the pace while near the inside, bid into the lane from the two path, dueled for the lead
outside the eighth pole then faltered through the final eighth. MISTER MAN was in the three path through the turn and into the lane when never a serious
factor. VICE COP pressed the pace two wide through the turn then was empty turning into the lane. COMPLEX JUSTICE lunged airborn at the start then
steadied soon after, raced far back while off the rail and was never in it.

Footnotes
OCEAN HONEY was off alertly to gain the lead at once, cleared before the first call, continued on a clear lead into the lane while in the two path then held
while never seriously threatened. MARSANNE chased the winner through the turn and into the lane, could not gain on that one and settled for second best.
THATSHOWSHEROLLS chased the pace from along the inside through the turn, came off the inside into the lane and never was a threat while clear for the
show spot. CLOVERTOWNE never a threat while racing in the two path through the turn and into the lane and passed a couple while not a theat. TAYA
ALLDAYA saved ground through the turn then lacked a finishing bid. MIDNIGHT XO was in the three path through the turn when near the back, came into
the lane from the six path and never was a factor. LAVISH LIFE STYLE chased the pace from the two path into the turn then faded.

MANSFIELD TIGER set the pace from the three path into the far turn, cleared in late turn, widened to the eighth pole when in the two path then held. BERN

for the place spot. SPACE FORCE WON was in the five path through the firs turn, moved closer down the backstretch while well off the inside, got closest in
mid-turn when asked, continued to chase the winner into the lane then lacked a closing repsonse. NIP N TUCK pressed the early pace while in the two path,
settled to the back after the half, continued in the two path into the lane and never was a menace. C F V BULLET pressed the pace along the inside into the
far turn then faded. SCORE KEEPER raced in the four path through the first turn, moved to stalk the pace down the backstretch, was suddenly done
entering the turn then was eased through the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
FERDAN vied for the lead two wide through the turn, shook clear into the lane, widened to the eighth pole then slowly extended the margin while under a
hand drive. VICTOR'S DEAL vied for the lead along the inside through late turn, lost contact with the winner when straightening in the lane, shifted into the
three path for the drive, could not gain on the top one then settled for second best. VENICE BEACH chased the two rival duel through the turn, tipped into
the three or four path for the drive and lacked a closing bid while just lasting for the show spot. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE never a factor while saving
ground. LOOKIN AT JUSTICE was in the two path through the turn then weakened after turning into the lane.

GAVINERA set the pace on a clear lead into the turn, slowly widened through the turn, extended the advantage to the eighth pole then was ridden out to the
end while stretching the advantage. LILY'S HOME was unhurried while in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and
moved up for the place spot while not a threat to the winner. FOR THE BISCUIT was in the three path through the turn when never far back, came into the
lane from the two path and never was a threat. SKI SLOPE chased the pace from the two path through the turn and was tired inside the sixteenth pole.
CATCHA LATER MO pressed the pace along the inside early, chased the pace into the turn then steadily faded. A STAR FOR CORA trailed throughout
while in the two or three path.

Footnotes
ALMIGHTYJUSTICE was unhurried while three wide through the turn, bid into the lane from the four or five path, rallied from mid-track through the final
eighth and cleared late. ANCHOR MANNE chased the pace from along the inside, shifted into the three path nearing the eighth pole,gained the lead outside
the sixteenth then could not hold the winner safe while second best. MAS ORO set the pace on a clear lead through the turn and into the lane, yielded to the
runner-up nearing the sixteenth pole then stayed on to be clear for the show spot. AMELIA'S MACHO was in the two path through the turn when never far
back, dropped to the rail for the drive and could not make up ground. VICIOUS RUMOR raced in the three path through the turn when chasing the pace,
swung into the lane from the four path, had aim on the top ones after straightening then weakened inside the eighth pole. CARNACK ON TOUR in the two
path through the turn when well back, settled along the rail for the drive and showed good energy though far too late. CROSSING THE ROAD never a factor
while in the three path, came into the lane from the five path and never was a factor. DREAM TRAVELER was squeezed back at the start, raced well back
while saving ground and never was in it. LOONY in the four path through the turn while well back, came into the lane from the six path and never factored.
BOLSHIE raced close up early while between rivals into the turn, steadied near the three-eighths pole and faded. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE
STRETCH RUN FOUND NO REASON FOR CHANGE OF ORDER.

inside, then improved position late in the four path. V. E. TIA pressed the pace between foes, then gave way after a half mile. D D SEVEN THIRTY pressed
the pace inside for a half mile and then gave way. FOUND MY MAN stalked the pace in the three path, then gave way on the far turn. SKIPPINJUSTICE
was not a factor. DASH OF SIMPLICITY saved ground, angled three wide on the far turn, then faded. HARLANS PRINCESS saved ground, then faded.

Footnotes
ADMIRAL'S GARNET chased the two rival duel through the turn, bid from the three path into the lane then drew away through the final eighth. EXPECT
THE BOSS was unhurried early, asked for more into the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenth pole and into the lane then steadily moved up while not a
threat to the winner. JUSTA SIMPLE GIRL vied for the lead two wide through the turn and into the lane, was no match for the top one after straightening in
the lane then lost the place spot late. LUCKYWISE was unhurried while in the two path through the turn and into the lane and steadily gained through the
lane. JERSEY GOLD never a serious factor while racing in the two path through the turn and into the seven path for the drive. CROSSED THE LINE raced
in the two path through the turn and into the lane and weakened. VERKLEMPT in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the eight
path and offered a belated gain. FABIOLA PRINCESS raced in contention through mid-turn when in the three path then tired. SHE RANUP THE AMEX
never a factor while in the three or four path. SWEET GINGER vied for the lead along the inside through the turn then retreated through the lane.

BONNIE BILL chased the pace from the two path through the turn, tipped into the three path for the drive, steadily gained on the leader, dueled with that
one inside the eighth pole until late and edged up. CAP DE FUEGO set the pace while in the two path through the turn, continued on a clear lead into the
lane, dueled with the winner inside the eighth pole and gave ground grudgingly while clearly second best. MANUELITO in the two path through the turn
when near the back, came into the lane from the three or four path and showed good energy to be up for the show spot. JOVA raced near the rail into the
turn when well back, came off the rail in late turn, entered the lane from the five path and moved up while not a serious threat. FLOWERPECKER chased
the pace along the inside into the lane then faded. BREWSKY was never a factor while in the three path through the turn. HE'S A WARRIOR saved ground
through the turn and into the lane then was empty and was subsequently vanned off. SUCCESSFULLY DONE chased the pace from the three path through
the turn and was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
BLUEGRASS PRAYER stalked the pace in the three path, bid at the quarter pole, drew off and lasted under mild urging. PICKLE FEET raced in the four
path, rallied through the stretch and missed inside late. DOSSIER stalked the pace in the four path, was checked at the sixteenth pole, nearly unseating the
rider and closed. GRAND IN BAY raced inside, was taken up at the eighth pole when a rival came in on him, angled out for running room, then was steadied
late when a foe was backing up into him. WISHY WASHY improved position late outside. SHOOTER JUSTICE pressed the pace outside of the leader,
dueled, gave way and lugged out into a foe. CASPER JUSTICE hopped at the start, then raced evenly. GO EARLY STAY LATE faded. TAY led inside, then
gave way on the turn. Following an inquiry into the stretch run, the Stewards' declined to take action.
