Footnotes
UNBRIDLED TIGER sprinted clear to set the pace and held safely while kept to task. THIRSTY KISS chased the pace, lacked the needed late rally and
finished second best. FORGOTTEN VOWS advanced inside on the turn, bid willingly, didn't have enough late and held for show. ROMEO'S GLORY
bumped at the start and gained late in a steady effort. SILENT DECLARATION bumped at the start, was never far off the pace, angled out for the drive and
offered a mild bid only. HIGH FLYIN TIGER was outrun in an even effort. J C EXPRESS was pinched back at the start and failed to contend. KOVACS was
not a factor. FISHIN THE RIVER broke out and bumped at the start, showed brief speed and stopped.

Footnotes
MAJOR ATTRACTION lagged early, bid three wide entering the stretch, dueled past the eighth pole, incohed away and held under pressure. FALSELY
ACCUSED stalked the pace, angled out for the drive, bid willingly and didn't have enough to get by. BOB'S ALL IN bobbled after the start, saved ground ,
bid between horses entering the stretch, dueled for the lead and faltered near the sixteenth pole and settled for show. SHIP IT RED stalked the pace and
lacked the needed late response. GRAY MAGICIAN was slow early, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and finished well. GIANT PAYDAY was slow
early, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and closed well. BIGFOOT CITY dueled two across to the second turn, swung wide and gave way.
FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM was through early, eased and walked off. SENSEMAKER dueled inside to the second turn, stopped, was eased and walked off.
