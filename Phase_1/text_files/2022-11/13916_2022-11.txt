Footnotes
CHAOS MAGIC raced within striking distance, moved up on the inside around the turn, angled out at the head of the stretch, made a bid and proved the
best late. DON'T LOOK ETHEL pressed the pace, took the advantage on the outside around the turn, but was outfinished late for the win. ROADSIDE GIRL
vied for the early lead, saved ground and was outfinished by the top two. IT'S TIME BABY had an awkward start, racing in the back, gained ground and
finished willingly. MO DIXIE DIVA raced in the middle of the field, finished evenly and was no real factor. SHOOTING STICK raced near the back, moved
up, but was no threat. AMELIES DREAMER pressed the early pace and faded. NEVERLAND BAND raced in the middle of the pack and faded.
POSEIDON'S QUEEN showed brief speed and dropped back. SAMMY JAMMY broke sharp, pulled up in the turn and walked off.

MO BELLA went to the front, drove clear, saved ground, led throughout and was kept to the task. JULIO CHOICE raced in the middle of the field, saved
ground around the final turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. ANN'S STORM raced within striking distance, saved ground around
the second turn, made a mild bid, proved no match for the top two, but got up for third. T R'S FIRST raced near the back in the early part, showed late
interest and was outfinished for show. FRIENDLY ACES raced within contention in the early going and faded. LES AND MADGE was fractious in the gates,
broke in the rear, improved position, but was no factor. ZEEROCK void of early speed and was never close. JUDGE THIS TRIP pressed the early pace and
dropped back. IN FOR A PENNY raced in the middle of the field and retreated.

Footnotes
SEGOVIANA unhurried in the beginning, raced outside around the turn, made a wide bid and got up late. TALTY vied for the early lead, forwardly placed
throughout, dueled down the home stretch and was outfinished. BITSY C C LIL GIRL challenged challenged for the early lead, weakened and lacked a late
kick. TAYLORS BABE lacked early speed, raced inside around the turn, steadied down the stretch, getting blocked, angled out, split rivals and finished
willingly. ENCORE ENCORE raced near the back in the early part, improved position, but was no real factor. FORT PIKE raced within contention and
weakened. PEPPER POINT void of early speed and was never a threat. ALIA MAX dueled on the front end, saved ground and faded on the inside. TALE
OF TENSAS lacked early speed and showed little. DONTFORGETRDREAMS had an awkward start, came around the turn wide and was never close.

Footnotes
VENN pressed the pace, came around the second turn four wide, made an outside bid and proved the best late. UNFATHOMED raced within contention,
forwardly placed throughout, made a bid, took the lead at the head of the home stretch, but proved no match late for the winner. WISE VERDICT void of
early speed, made a steady gain, but proved no match for the top two. INTIMIDATION lacked early speed, had an outside trip, showed late interest, but was
no factor. VODKA GIMLET raced near the middle of the field, put forth an even effort and lacked a bid. BIG CHOPPER showed early speed, took the
advantage down the backside, saved ground around the turn and faded. GAME DAY PLAY raced near the middle of the field and faded, while finishing
wide. DREWHUSTLE dueled on the front end, saved ground and made a steady retreat. VIM AND VIGOR raced in the middle of the pack, dropped back
and was no threat late.

Footnotes
CZAR'S BALLERINA unhurried in the early part, moved up on the inside around the second turn, angled out down the lane, made a bid, racing three wide
and proved the best late. KISS GOODBYE lacked early speed, moved up, took the lead at the head of the home stretch, but was outfinished late for the win.
DIATONIC dueled on the front end, saved ground around the final turn and lacked a late kick. MEAN AMERICAN raced within striking distance, made a bid
and hung. GUANAJUATO showed early speed and was finished early. STOP SHOP N DROP void of early speed, had an outside trip and was never a
threat. RESPECT ALL raced within contention and dropped back.
