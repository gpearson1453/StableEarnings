Footnotes
CHASING JOY vied two wide down the backstretch, drew clear early on the turn, drifted out a bit under left-handed urging in midstretch and held sway.
HOTLINE TO HEAVEN vied inside of the winner down the backstretch, chased that foe in the two path around the turn, tipped out in upper stretch and was
gaining late. ARROW SHAPE was off a step slow, advanced inside around the turn, had plenty of room inside of the winner in the lane but could only gain
mildly. ADIOS DIXIE chased the pace four wide and was one-paced through the lane. LOOK UP TO HEAVEN failed to menace while racing five wide.
AWESOME APEAL hit the starting gate, raced off the pace five wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and never threatened. MUDSHAFT was outrun
inside. ROSES FOR ASHLEY had brief speed three wide.

CLOUD PLAY raced off the pace three and four wide, angled to the rail near the quarter pole, came through inside foes in midstretch, took the lead near the
sixteenth pole and drew clear. LOYAL LOUIE tracked the pace four wide between rivals, shifted further out in upper stretch and rallied outside to gain the
place in the final strides. PERFECT PICTURE set the pace in the two path, led to the sixteenth pole and lost second late. PHAROAH CAT stalked the pace
two wide and weakened through the final furlong. PARTNER'S HOPE hit the starting gate to get off slowly, raced four wide and never threatened. LEE
ANN'S WARRIOR prompted the pace three wide and faded in the lane. BEST CHANCE YET failed to menace while racing five and six wide. AMOR

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT ONYX led from inside, opened up from the two path into the stretch, and drew clear. THE KHOZAN ONE pressed from two wide, floated out to
the five path into the lane, and ran on to hold place. GOLDEN TALENT got squeezed at the start, chased from the four path, was driven along from the six
path into the stretch, and kept on for show. MATRO was held up in the three path early, was ridden from the five path into the stretch, but finished evenly.
GRAND MACALLAN stalked in the two path, was hustled from the four path into the lane, but flattened. MR JACK bumped with an outer foe, trailed from the
six path and was no factor. OLORUN bumped with an inner foe, rated from the five path, moved up around the turn, but faded in the stretch. THE GOLDEN
ONE tracked from inside but was empty going into the stretch.

ME AND MR. C settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, seized command in upper stretch, kicked clear in
midstretch and held safe. HOT BLOODED trailed in the two path around the first turn, advanced four wide around the far turn and rallied outside through the
lane. LAMPLIGHTER JACK settled off the pacesetter in the clear two wide, advanced outside down the backstretch, briefly led around the far turn but was
no match for the top two in the lane. TANGO TANGO TANGO saved ground off the pace, advanced two wide around the turn, tipped three wide in upper
stretch and lacked the needed rally. SEVEN CHANNELS chased the pace two wide and faded in the lane. KENTUCKY PHAROAH set the pace along the
rail and retreated after six furlongs. LURE HIM IN stumbled at the start, lost the rider, galloped around riderless and walked off. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE START AND FOUND NO REASON TO TAKE ACTION.

Footnotes
NATIVE THUNDER pressed in the four path, took over from the three path into the lane, and held on. ON THIN ICE tracked in the three path, was roused
from the six path into the stretch, and ran on for place. MARITIME WINGS (IRE) was held up in the six path early, swung out to the eight path going into the
stretch, and kept on for show. FELIX rated in the three path, shifted out to the four path into the stretch, and stayed on. SPACE RUNNER raced in midpack
from the five path, was driven along from the seven path into the stretch, but finished evenly. UNO TIGER raced from wellback between rivals but was one
paced through the lane. LAKER MAMBA broke inwards at the start, prompted the pace from the five path but yielded at the top of the lane. GREAT KING
(FR) led from the two path early but gaveway around the far turn. KARTANO was off slow, trailed into the stretch, and was no menace. SIGRUN FAST BOY
raced in midfield from the three path but was empty going into the stretch. LORENZ (BRZ) chased from inside but backed up around the far turn.

Footnotes
STRONG AGAIN was unhurried from the four path, was roused to take aim from the seven path going into the lane, drifted in and bumped with an inner
rival, and rallied to get up late. RED HURRICANE dueled from the two path, took the lead into the stretch, drifted out and bumped an outer foe, and ran on
to hold place. WARP SPEED BABY stalked in the four path, was ridden from the five path into the lane, and kept on but got bumped on both sides and
squeezed late to show. GAMBLING TZAR rated in the three path, was ridden two wide into the stretch, but was one paced. MISTER J T dueled from the
three path early but gaveway in the stretch. MAJOR FRONTIER raced in midpack from the two path but was empty going into the lane. DANLEY trailed
from the three path early and was no menace. ARIES REIGNS tracked in the three path but backed up around the far turn. AN INQUIRY AND OBJECTION
WAS LODGED TO LOOK AT THE STRETCH RUN OF THE TOP THREE FINISHERS, RED HURRICANE WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED THIRD
FOR DRIFTING OUT MANY PATHS AND BUMPING WITH WARP SPEED BABY IN DEEP STRETCH COSTING SAID RIVAL A CHANCE FOR BETTER
PLACING.

Footnotes
MAMA STRONG raced off the early pace outside, advanced five wide around the turn, closed outside, was up near the sixteenth pole, vied outside of the
runner-up late and held firm. LOVE IS AWESOME was in range inside early, steadied entering the turn, tipped two wide soon after, edged closer between
foes around the bend, rallied between foes in the lane, vied inside of the winner late and was narrowly outfinished. MO TIME set the pace in the two path,
led to the sixteenth pole and saved the show. TESTED POSITIVE raced off the pace four wide, swung eight wide in upper stretch and rallied widest. FIA
FIRST pressed the pace four wide and evened out in the lane. STEPHANIE MY LOVE failed to menace while racing six wide. AWESOME IDENTITY raced
three wide in midpack, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked the needed rally. PASAJERA broke awkwardly, was bumped early, raced well back
three wide, made some progress in upper stretch then lacked a clear path the final sixteenth. SEEKINGBYTHESTORM pressed the pace three wide
between foes and tired in the drive. DIOSA FORTUNA was bumped early, raced three wide and never threatened. BREAKING BULLET was outrun inside.
MARISSATHEPRINCESS was bumped early, saved ground and was never involved.
