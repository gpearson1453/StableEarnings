Footnotes
CITIZEN WEST vied on the front end, dueled throughout and drove clear late. SHIPPINGPORT challenged for the early advantage, saved ground final turn,
eased back, came again down the stretch and got up for second. CUCINA raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished for
second. UNION STATION void of early speed, gamed ground, finished willingly and was outfinished for show. MINNESOTA MIRACLE lacked early speed,
came around the second turn on the outside, made a wide bid, but was no factor. JOHNNYSJOURNEY pressed the pace, saved ground around the final
turn and faded. LIKEN IT raced evenly near the back and was never close. BIG BOY DAVE REX raced near the middle of the pack and faded. SMARTY
GRIMES raced within contention and dropped back.

AMBASSADOR HOUSE raced in the middle of the pack, finished wide and put forth an even effort. COUNTRY CUT bumped at the start, racing near the
back and was never a threat. UNBRIDLED PULPIT raced evenly near the back and showed little. WITCH'S VOW dueled on the front end, saved ground
and was finished early. MICHAEL'S BAD BOY always raced near the back and was outrun.

Footnotes
MY AMIGO CHARLIE stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up on the inside around the turn, angled out, rallied and was going away at the end.
MIZSPELT void of early speed, raced outside around the turn, made a bid, racing four wide, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second.
CARLOS PUNCH vied on the front end, forwardly placed throughout and was nipped at the wire for second. CABOCHON TREASURE lacked early speed,
moved up and finished evenly. JUST PLAIN MAD challenged for the early lead and weakened. BULLETSREVENGE raced within contention in the early
going, faded and went to the wire evenly. MAD GOLD always raced near the back and showed little. HALF A BUCK raced in the middle of the field in the
beginning, dropped back and was outrun.

MY FRIEND AMY unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the final turn, rallied and was going away at the end. JUBELLA pressed the
pace, raced close throughout, eased off the front, came again down the stretch, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. TEXAS RED BEL
went to the front, drove clear and was outfinished late for second. TINCANDANCE raced within contention, was close throughout and lacked a late kick.
AKIANE'S SOLDIER raced in the middle of the field, came around the first turn on the outside and put forth an even effort. CHASING SHADOWS void of
early speed and was never a factor. EXPLOSIVELY HOT raced near the middle of the pack, saved ground around the final turn and faded. KIND WAYS
pressed the early pace, dropped back and was outrun.

Footnotes
A RUNNIN AFLEET unhurried in the beginning, made a steady gain and finished strong. COZZOLANI raced within striking distance, forwardly placed
throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. SUZY DOLL'S READY vied for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, drifted in
stretch and faded, while racing on the rail. ABBY DABBY raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the turn, angled out down the stretch and
went to the wire evenly. BLUE COWGIRL broke a step slow, racing near the back, steadied late to avoid down rider and was never a factor. SKY TIZZY
raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. CLASSY NANA broke a step slow, racing in the rear and was never close. MARINA dueled on the front
end, weakened down the stretch, clipped heels and lost rider, walked off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS CALLED INTO THE STRETCH RUN OF THE
RACE. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED #5 SUZY DOLL'S READY FROM 3RD AND PLACED HER LAST FOR INTERFERENCE
AT THE HEAD OF THE LANE.
