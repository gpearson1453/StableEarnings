BUFFALO SHUFFLE took control early, began widening on the turn and dominated his rivals while kept to his task. WE READY broke very slowly, swung
wide on the turn and rallied for the place. I SAW IT ALL trailed early, advanced very wide and closed well. BOOM BOOM KABOOM raced in closest pursuit
of the pacesetter and proved empty in the stretch. MASROUR stumbled and ducked out sharply at the start losing his best chance. CRISTIANO'S DREAM
saved ground close up and began fading into the far turn.

CICI UNIFIED set the pace on the inside racing with a clear lead, showed the way on the turn, responded when roued, pulled away and was kept to the
task. SCARF stumbled at the start, raced off the pace between rivals, chased inside on the turn, finished evenly for a clear second. ANOTHER SAUCY SIX
trailed the field, moved up three wide on the backside, then four wide on the turn, rallied mildly outside in the lane and earned the show spot.
MISBEHAVING LADY raced three wide off the pace, chased on the turn and had no rally. POP THE CLUTCH raced four wide off the pace, chased three
wide on the turn and weakened. DON'T B RIDICULOUS raced off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten. GONE DREAMING tracked the pacesetter,
chased two wide on the turn and tired. MONSTER RISING raced off the pace inside and gave way. EMMA'S TOUCH raced off the pace inside and was
outrun.

winner in midstretch and flattened out. COBBLE ROAD settled wide off the leaders, advanced on the final turn then tired. THE KING CHEEK forced the
pace outside to the final turn and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
STORMY BONNIE sent to the front, cleared the field to set the pace, showed the way into the far turn, turned back a bid from FEARLESS FLY at the
quarter pole and drew clear under urging. FEARLESS FLY tracked on the inside, chased the winner on the turn, made a bid at the quarter pole, was no
match and then dug in to earn the place spot. WE BE THERE raced off the pace, advanced outside rivals on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and
rallied mildly outside. THE METHOD stalked between rivals, chased on the far turn, finished evenly and got fourth. THIS ILL DEFEND tracked on the inside,
chased on the far turn and lacked a bid. ORBERT raced off the pace inside, chased on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. TWO
PRINCES raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. ANGELI BLU raced four wide early and was outrun. SAILOR AGAIN raced four wide early,
stalked three wide and gave way.

DATE NIGHT KISSES prompted the pace, took over at the quarter pole then drew off while bearing out badly through the final furlong. TITANIC ROSE
trailed early then finished with good energy to gain the place while no threat to the winner. MOONBOOTS slipped through inside to threaten on the final turn
then weakened in the stretch. BURANO hustled to a narrow lead inside, vied on the final turn then faltered. CHELSEA WALL lacked speed outside and
failed to menace. QUARTERFLASH saved ground just off the leaders and faltered after half a mile. CONNOISSEUR moved up three wide on the first turn,
forced the pace briefly and stopped.
