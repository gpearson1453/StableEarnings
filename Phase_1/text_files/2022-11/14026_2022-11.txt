Footnotes
THORNY TALE tracked the early leader from the inside down the backstretch, angled to the outside of foe entering the far turn and got up late while racing
from the outside under strong handling. YES SIR ROBERT showed good early foot to the pace from the outside of rival while racing well off the inside,
drifted through the stretch run and gave way grudgingly to the winner late in a game effort. SICILIA MIKE was off slowly, dropped back off the early pace,
moved up from the outside through the upper stretch and moved up late to improve position. ERAWAN was slow early, moved up from the inside around the
far turn and made a mild late run. MY MAN POTS N PANS stalked the pace, raced near the inside past the three eighths pole and faded. EKATI'S VERVE
settled to race off the early pace, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and never threatened.

NO MORE TALK raced off the early duel, moved up four wide from the outside of foes near the three eighths pole and edged away to be well clear under
strong handling. OXIDE raced off the early going, moved up through the far turn, raced four to five wide into the upper stretch, shifted in and got up for the
place position late. TOMMY SHELBY settled to race mid pack early, angled to race four to five wide around the far turn, moved up through the upper stretch
and flattened out. MAMAIGOTTHIS was off slowly, lagged in the early stages, moved up from the inside around the far turn through the stretch and
improved position. CAMP PENDLETON hit the gate at the start, raced along the inside around the far turn, angled widest through the stretch run and moved
up. ACOSTA hard sent from the inside to duel early on and weakened through the stretch run. SHOULDA HAD IT dueled for the early lead while racing
between early and faded. MAID THE JOURNEY dueled for the early lead from the outside of foes and gave way. BOONDOGGLE tired readily and was

WINKED prompt the pace from the outside and finished well in the stretch run to edge clear under strong pressure. TARGE sent along early, set the pace
along the inside and narrowly held the place position late but was no match for the winner. FUHGEDDABOUDIT chased the early pace, raced from the
inside around the far turn, angled through the stretch and finished willingly from the outside of foes. SHE'SAROLLINGSTONE raced three wide around the
far turn, was six deep near the three sixteenths pole and raced evenly with no late run. QUIET IMAGINATION raced off the early going, swung six to seven
wide into the upper stretch and made a late gain to improve position. TWELVEO'CLOCKROCK raced mid pack early on, was four to five deep from the
outside of rivals around the far turn and lacked a bid. HITCH A RIDE was unhurried early on, raced four deep near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a
rally. FACTORINTHEHEAT raced off the early pace, was near the inside and had no response.

Footnotes
BEHIND THE COUCH stalked the pace, moved up three wide near the quarter pole, angled out through the stretch run and got up under steady handling.
LADY JEAN raced off the early pace, altered through the upper stretch, shifted between late and surged late to get up for the place position. UNREQUITED
LOVE pressed the pace from the outside of rival, took command near the quarter pole, was clear near the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly late.
AWESOME VIEW settled off the early pace, raced near the inside early on, angled to race off the inside near the five sixteenths pole, raced seven deep into
the upper stretch and moved up late. CANADIAN GINGER was coaxed along early, took back to race in hand and weakened a bid in the drive. DANCER'S
MELODY broke in the air, raced three wide around the far turn and had no late rally while racing five wide. BAHAMA PEARL raced off the early pace,
moved up six wide near the quarter pole, fanned seven to eight wide through the upper stretch and never threatened. PROPER ATTIRE showed good early
speed to set the early pace and faltered through the drive.
