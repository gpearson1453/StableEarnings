Footnotes
SWAMP SOUFFLE rallied five wide on the second turn, was carried out, got a head in front and drew off past the eighth pole. TWO GUNS pressed the pace
two wide, took command on the turn, swung wide, contended to mid stretch and was outclosed to finish second best. FORT LANGLEY was slow early,
offered a mild bid only and earned show. BERNALINHO stalked the pace, had nothing left for drive and faded. SILVER DASH stalked along the inside,
challenged into the stretch, vied to mid stretch and faltered. WEAR THE CROWN set a pressured pace to the second turn, tired and gave way. ALPINE
HYPNOSIS trailed the field and showed little.

WE'RE JUST SAYIN was unhurried early, went seven wide at the top of the stretch, bid willingly to duel and inched clear to prove best. CATS TOUCH
broke out, raced close to the pace along the inside, bid three wide to duel and didn't have enough late. RONALD R (IRE) lagged early, got through inside on
the turn and closed to get up for show. OSTINI was crowded at the start, raced in the middle of the pack, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and closed
well. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE was slow early, went nine wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a rally. LOYALTY SPIRIT stalked the pace, bid four wide
and came up empty. BOURBON TAN was crowded at the start, set the pace to the upper stretch, tired and gave way. MILORDS OATHKEEPER was never
far back, had nothing left for the drive and faded. RUN TAPPY was not a factor.
