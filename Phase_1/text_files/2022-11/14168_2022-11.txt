Footnotes
MANDONA dueled on the outside up the backstretch, kicked clear while racing in the two path around the turn and drew off down the lane, geared down at
the wire. GRANDIOSE SUMMER raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, came around the turn in the three path and improved
position in the stretch but was no match for the winner. DOWNTHESTREETDEBBY dueled on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, gave way
while saving ground around the turn and couldn't go with the winner from there. DADDY'SFAVORITESON raced off the pace on the outside early, navigated
the turn from the three path and never threatened. FLASHIN PASSION chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path
around the turn and faded in the stretch. FACE OF GRACE trailed throughout, came around the turn in the two path and made no bid.
