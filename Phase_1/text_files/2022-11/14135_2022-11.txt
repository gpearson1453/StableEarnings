GOLDEN ALE set a clear early pace from the start, raced three wide though the turns, opened up and drew off. ARRABIATA followed the early pace, raced
four wide into the turn, was no match late and finished second best. THE GREEN CRUSADER was unhurried early, raced between rivals into the second
turn and finished evenly late. COLOR ME LEGENDARY was allowed to settle early, raced off the rail through the home turn and flattened out. MYOPIC
tracked the early pace, went five through the second turn and gave way. WESTPHAL stumbled slightly at the start, was void of any early speed, raced four
wide into the second turn and offered no late rally.
