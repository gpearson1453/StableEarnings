Footnotes
STARRY MIDNIGHT brushed the off side stall at the start getting away last, then began climbing when facing the kickback of the rivals in front, tipped out to
the five path continuing to hop along growing detached at the tail of the field, tucked three wide into the turn and came under light coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, steadily gained through the bend before getting on track to pose a serious threat spinning five to six wide into upper stretch, continued the
good finish closing stoutly on the outside to take narrow command near the sixteenth pole, dug in gamely to fend off a battle ready rival to the wire getting
the bob on the line. VAX broke out at the start bumping QUEENS OVER THREES in tandem with BUSTIN HOT, raced three then two wide in closest aim of
the leader coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, dug in under
threat and was collared a sixteenth out, fought on gamely inside to come again but lost the nod on the wire. BUSTIN HOT broke in at the start bumping
QUEENS OVER THREES in concert with the aforementioned foe, showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, spun two
to three wide into upper stretch under challenge, conceded the front near the eighth pole and kept on clear of the rest to preserve the show honors.
MARLEY'S GHOST four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened. QUEENS
OVER THREES got bumped between foes at the start and was lightly pinched back, chased five then four wide under a ride from midway on the turn,
swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. RED BUTTERFLY hustled from the gate, chased along the inside until tipped to the two path half a mile
from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued in the two path into upper stretch and tired. SPINNING COLORS hustled from the start,
chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
REIGNING CHICK was last to commence then dropped back while climbing into kickback, was urged at the rear of the field, went around most of the turn in
the two path then shifted three wide, rallied seven wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while
moving clear late in a big effort. HOLIDAY JAZZ displayed good speed, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two to three path around the turn,
shook clear at the five-sixteenths, was asked for her best in upper stretch, led until outside the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while clear for the place.
RUN DEVIL bumped with a rival at the start, showed speed then chased the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, was driven three wide into the stretch,
chased the leader under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but held the show. R GIRL FAITH was hard ridden off the pace, went four wide for the
majority of the turn then dropped to the three path, was guided to the two path while behind horses at the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. I'M
NERVOUS NOW moved out while chasing the pace, started the turn in the three path, shifted five wide before the five-sixteenths, drifted out outside the
furlong marker and tired. TEMPERMENTAL settled near the back under some urging, saved ground on the turn, steadied while in tight against the rail
outside the quarter-pole, was roused in upper stretch and failed to rally. CAPITAL GAL was coaxed along on the outside, moved up near the
nine-sixteenths, shifted from the four to the six path around the turn and capitulated. WICKED LADY was coaxed along off the pace, angled in outside the
half-mile pole, went two to three wide on the turn and had nothing left. RIGBY broke in and bumped with a foe, pressed the pace, vied in the three to four
path on the turn, dropped back near the five-sixteenths and faded.

Footnotes
TODAY'S FLAVOR established the front just after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch, went clear under a drive and was geared down in the late stages. MY MAN MATTY three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. REFUAH chased two to three wide under
a ride from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and improved position to procure the show honors. CLASH A. J. chased just off the inside in
closest range of the leader, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. STONECOLDWARRIOR
chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, tipped out four wide into upper stretch, tired. CAPLETON got forced to steady at the start when
rivals took over his lane, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, was unable to make
an impact, then got pulled up when returning from the gallop out and was subsequently vanned off. SUPPORT THE CAT broke open the stall door prior to
the start and was backed out and reloaded, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, went five wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
TIMELESS JOURNEY prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, took over in upper stretch,
shook clear into the final furlong and proved best under steady urging. BEACHFRONT BID was well placed just off the pace on the inside, drafted along the
rail around the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, chased the winner under a drive in the stretch and was second best. SWEET SURPRISE went to the
front, showed the way with company to her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was given her cue outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the
winner in upper stretch and weakened while able to hold the show. TO A T was last to commence, settled on the outside, ranged up while asked five then
four wide on the turn, chased outside into the final furlong and tired. KERIK tracked the pace, came under urging near the nine-sixteenths, chased four to
five wide on the turn and came up empty. RHOMBIQUE settled at the rear of the field, was roused in the two path on the turn, turned into the stretch under
the crop and failed to respond.

Footnotes
SWEETLOU'SGOTACES went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace on the inside, responded well when set down in upper stretch, drew off
while still on her inside lead to the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and proved much the best while kept to the task. SMOKIE EYES was
taken in hand early then reserved on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, came under a drive in upper stretch and narrowly earned the place.
ALLURING ANGEL (GB) settled towards the rear while two to three wide, was roused on the far turn and improved to just miss the place while narrowly up
for the show. BULSARA was taken in hand towards the rear early, became rank under restraint into the first turn, moved from the rail to the three path on
that bend, was reserved at the back, saved ground early on the far turn, checked near the five-sixteenths then shifted three wide and improved to just miss
the trifecta. LIFELOVENLAUGHTER was well placed just off the pace on the inside, chased on the far turn, came out into the stretch and weakened.
PRIVATE CREDIT went two to three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn and came up empty.
NEXT EPISODE went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, chased three wide on the far turn and capitulated. THE CLASSY ONE was taken in
hand early, went three then four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, traveled five wide on the far turn,
spun six wide into the stretch and was no factor. AGUA DULCE (GB) went two to three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, rounded the far turn
in the four path under urging and failed to respond. THIRTY THOU KELVIN went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused three wide
between foes on the far turn and also failed to respond.

Footnotes
ELOQUIST showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, dug in dueling through the
length of the stretch and gamely got the nose on the wire. BARESE coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing from just inside the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, rallied to duel with the aforementioned foe through to the finish in game fashion and was ultimately denied at the
end. NAVAL AVIATOR coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide for home and
improved position. WINIT five then four wide into the first turn, raced seven paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the
far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide for home and weakened. AFFABLE MONARCH chased three wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths and offered no response. SAINT TAPIT three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide under coaxing from three
furlongs out, went eight wide into upper stretch and faltered. BE BETTER coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the
seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
STAR DEVINE (IRE) moved up in hand then pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path around the turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole,
responded well under threat in the stretch and held gamely. CHANGE OF CONTROL was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was
asked in the two path at the quarter-pole, moved further out in upper stretch, gained to make a bid into the final furlong, fought with good courage to the wire
but was outfinished while able to get the place. LADY EDITH broke with her forelegs in the air and was off a bit slow, raced towards the rear on the outside
under reserve, went three wide on the turn, was roused five wide into the stretch, gained to make a bid near the furlong marker but was out-kicked while
able to get the show. HONEY PANTS broke out and bumped with a foe, settled just off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was asked at the
five-sixteenths, shifted three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. ATHWAAQ crossed over while going to the front, showed the way down the
backstretch, vied inside on the turn, lost the lead to the winner at the quarter-pole and gave way. GOGO SHOES was bumped at the start then forced out
into another foe, saved ground under urging and failed to rally. HIT THE WOAH bumped with a rival after the start then checked between foes, settled at the
rear, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved out outside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. MAIL ORDER broke
awkwardly then was bumped in the hindquarters, was taken up when the pacesetter crossed in front early, moved up to stalk the pace on the outside then in
the three path around the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
LADY SHYLOCK showed the way in hand just off the inside down the backstretch before tucking along the inside through the turn, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, drew off under a drive to prevail. TAP IT UP two to three wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while knocking heads to the finish running on to secure
the place honors in the final jumps. BABY SOX forwardly placed four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide for home and ran on to procure the show honors. GERMANY JAYVO chased five wide under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went nine wide into upper stretch and offered up a belated bid. BELLA MICHELLE lunged at the break, chased five then
four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and weakened. WILLFUL DESIRE chased two to three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. BRING THE MAGIC chased five paths off the inside down
