Footnotes
DARKSABER broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, showed good speed while setting solid fractions through the turn, remained clear to mid-stretch
and kept to task in the final stages. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET was a bit slow into early stride, advanced along the rail nearing the quarter marker, continued
that rally approaching mid-stretch, closed on the winner in the final stages but could not reel that one in and was second best. BALLROOM HUSTLER came
in tight in the early stages and steadied nearing the half-mile marker, chased the pace two wide on the turn, was no match for the top two in the drive but
kept on late to secure the show. HULA KING showed early speed and tracked the solid fractions, lost ground to the winner nearing the quarter marker,
swung four wide for the drive, weakened in the final stages and was edged for third. CASH LIMIT chased the pace from the inside and did not offer a late
rally. BERNIE'S BIG BOY chased the solid early fractions, came three deep on the turn, lost position in upper stretch and lacked a late response. MERGIE
TROID lacked early speed and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
FRISCO KID was unhurried, raced two wide along the turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch, closed well in the final furlong and kept to task in deep stretch
to prevail. REALLY EASY was allowed to settle, raced outside of rivals on the turn, swung four wide into the drive, rallied inside of the furlong marker, could
not match strides with the winner in deep stretch and was up for place in the final strides. FIRST STYLE showed good early speed, cleared the field into the
turn, set solid fractions while extending the lead to the quarter marker, drew to a long lead into mid-stretch, tired readily inside of the furlong marker, was
caught in deep stretch and edged for place, while holding safely for show in the end. ONE BROAD STREET settled off of the solid early pace, saved ground
to the top of the lane, chased the pacesetter to mid-stretch, offered a mile late rally and was outfinished in the final stages. THECHIEFHASTRICKS was
away alertly, chased the pacesetter to the turn, lost ground to FIRST STYLE nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way.
AFRICAN PRINCE chased from the rear, came four wide into the drive and was not a factor.

RIO KING settled off of the early fractions, came three wide into the backstretch run, was never far back to the second turn, advanced two wide nearing the
quarter marker, swung four wide for the drive, loomed in upper stretch, assumed command in mid-stretch and kicked clear in the late stages. UPSTART
YANKEE was unhurried early on, saved ground through the backstretch run, was roused four wide leaving the far turn, closed well inside of the furlong
marker and was second best in the end. BIG SWEDE rated off of the early pace, pulled on the rider on the first turn, jostled VANISKY entering the
backstretch run, raced close to the pace to the second turn, advanced three wide into the drive, vied for the lead nearing mid-stretch, gave way in the final
stages and held for show. TEX HANLEY was forwardly placed in the early stages, prompted the moderate fractions into the second turn, vied for the lead
nearing the furlong pole, could not keep pace late and gave way. CARSON'S LEGACY stalked the moderate early fractions, lost position along the
backstretch run, came two wide along the far turn, re-rallied in upper stretch, could not sustain that run in deep stretch and flattened out. BLUE SILVER was
sent to establish the early lead, set moderate fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, held a narrow advantage to the quarter marker, lost
position in upper stretch and faded. VANISKY stalked the early pace while three wide, was jostled leaving the first turn when BIG SWEDE became rank and

Footnotes
SMOKEMS TAPHOUSE tracked the moderate early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, loomed in upper stretch, overtook MADAME GAZELLE leaving
the furlong marker, kept to task in the late stages and prevailed in a drive over the oncoming runner-up. HOW ABOUT A FRESCA rated off of the early
pace, was steered three wide along the turn, swung four wide for the drive, closed fast inside of the furlong marker, pressured the winner in deep stretch but
could not get by and was second best. MADAME GAZELLE broke alertly and dictated early terms, set a pressured pace through the turn, shook free in
upper stretch, was confronted by the winner nearing the furlong pole, grudgingly gave way in the late stages and held safely for show. DANZIGS STAR
STORM took back leaving the break and stalked the pace to the turn, saved ground to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and finished evenly
in the final furlong. YODERANDO chased from the rear in the early stages, raced outside of rivals on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch run and
lacked a late response. LOVE LOST broke alertly, showed early speed to press the pace to the turn, kept close attendance to MADAME GAZELLE to the
quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
LOVING SPIRIT showed good early speed, assumed command of the lead in the early stages, drew clear heading to the turn, set fast fractions through the
quarter marker, was kept to task in the lane, was ridden out in deep stretch and was much the best in the end. AIRKITA broke alertly, could not keep pace
with LOVING SPIRIT in the early stages and chased that one to the turn, came two wide to the quarter marker, was no match for the winner in the final
furlong, rallied late and was up for place in the final strides. ANGRY EMMY chased the quick early fractions, saved ground on the turn, ran in pursuit to
mid-stretch, was outfinished in deep stretch and was just edged for place in the final strides, while well clear for show. PETE'S INFERNO broke in at the
start and was off slowly, chased the pacesetter to the turn, came in tight entering the turn, took up and dropped back leaving the three-furlong marker,
swung four wide for the drive, was not able to impact the leaders in deep stretch but showed good late interest. JEANIE'S SWAN chased from the rear,
saved ground in pursuit through the turn, gained ground nearing the furlong marker and finished evenly in deep stretch. JACKIE SERMON chased the early
pace from a three wide path, dropped back in upper stretch and was not a late threat. LASSAROCK was crowded at the start and was away slowly, chased
the early pace from the rear, lost position two wide on the turn, made a mild rally into mid-stretch, could not sustain that bid in the late stages and flattened
out.

Footnotes
ENJOY IT STRAIT was forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the pace from a three wide path into the backstretch run, advanced nearing the
half-mile marker, overtook GORDY'S BOY nearing the quarter marker, extended the lead to mid-stretch and drew clear in the late stages. GORDY'S BOY
was asked for early speed and assumed command into the first turn, contested the pace with JEDI KNIGHT through the backstretch run, was overtaken by
ENJOY IT STRAIT nearing the quarter marker, chased the winner to mid-stretch, could not make headway in deep stretch and held well in the final stages
for second. SUNNY SPOT rated off of the decent early pace, raced three wide between foes through the backstretch run, improved position nearing the
quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch, made a mild late rally in the final furlong and held safely for third in the end. IMPLICITLY settled off of the early
pace, tracked two wide between runners through the backstretch run, lost position heading to the second turn, slipped to the inside nearing the top of the
lane, improved position in mid-stretch and did not offer a late response. HUNGRY HENRY saved all of the ground while stalking the early pace, shifted to
the two path along the second turn, gained ground in upper stretch, could not sustain that bid in the final furlong and gave way. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE)
came four wide along the first turn, maintained the four wide trip to the second turn while never far back and did not mount a late rally. JEDI KNIGHT
showed early speed and contested the reasonable fractions through the backstretch run, lost position on the second turn and dropped back in upper stretch.

Footnotes
I GIVE UP was unhurried in the early stages, came three wide into the backstretch run, slipped to the inside while improving position on the far turn, loomed
in upper stretch, vied for the lead while skimming the rail approaching the furlong marker, took command nearing the sixteenth-pole and kept to task in the
final stages to prevail. PEACEHAVEN came three wide into the first turn while settling off of the moderate early fractions, gained ground four wide on the
second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed well in the final stages and was up for place in the final strides. BIG JOLT saved ground in the early going
while racing in the second flight, gained ground on the second turn, swung three wide into the stretch, advanced to vie for the lead nearing the furlong pole,
was outfinished by the top pair in the final sixteenth and was clear for show in the end. CAL ROUGH showed good early speed and contested the pace with
TRUE COMFORT, shook free from that rival along the backstretch run, was confronted again by that foe on the far turn, took a narrow lead to the furlong
marker, could not keep pace with oncoming runners in deep stretch and gave way. ON VACATION settled off of the early pace, saved all of the ground,
improved position on the second turn, came within aim at the top of the lane, lacked room nearing mid-stretch and did not produce a late response. BIG
ROSIE was forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, advanced three wide approaching the quarter
marker, swung six wide for the drive and weakened in the final furlong. STRIKING SHIRL was allowed to settle, maintained position while two wide through
the backstretch run, came three wide while trailing along the far turn and was not a late factor. TRUE COMFORT broke alertly and showed speed to contest
the early pace, ceded the lead along the backstretch run, re-engaged with CAL ROUGH on the second turn, battled for the lead to mid-stretch, could not
hold off oncoming rivals in the final furlong and tired late. FLAPS UP stumbled leaving the break, was a bit rank on the run to the first turn, settled four wide
off of the early pace, improved position on the backstretch run, lost ground five wide entering the second turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
LOVE'EM N LEAVE'EM was well placed in the early stages, raced along the rail while tracking the quick early pace, angled three wide nearing the top of the
lane, closed determinedly in deep stretch and got by the game runner-up in the final strides to prevail. FAST PER SE broke sharply and was sent to the
early lead, set fast fractions while pressured to the turn, was challenged by STANFORD BAY nearing the quarter marker, turned away that foe and drew
clear to mid-stretch, was all out in the final sixteenth, met the bid of LOVE'EM N LEAVE'EM in deep stretch, could not hold off the determined winner in the
final strides and just held for second on the wire. LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF was allowed to settle, came four wide into the turn, swung five wide for the
drive, closed with a rush in deep stretch, could not reel in the winner and just missed for place on the wire, while holding safely in the end for third. STORMY
SAMURAI was squeezed at the start and was off a bit slowly, chased three wide into the turn, shifted out four wide for the drive, closed willingly in the final
furlong but was unable to impact the leaders in deep stretch. C'MON MAN was shuffled back leaving the start and spotted the field early on, chased the
pace to the turn, came four wide into the bend then slipped to the two path nearing the top of the lane, showed good late interest in the final furlong but was
unable to threaten in the end. UNTO THEE was forwardly placed, tracked the early speed while two then three wide on the turn, dropped back in upper
stretch and weakened. STANFORD BAY showed early speed and pressed the pacesetter to the turn, advanced to challenge FAST PER SE nearing the
quarter marker, was repelled in that effort, lost ground into upper stretch and tired late.

Footnotes
TERRY'S BOY showed good speed from the gate and found a good tracking position in the early going under a snug hold for the first quarter mile, moved
up to challenge the leaders under confident handling at the top of the stretch, responded when roused and won going away. ETHAN'S ANIMAL broke out at
the start, settled in the four path for the run down the backstretch, launched a bid from the three-eighths pole while still wide, encountered some traffic in
deep stretch, finished with good energy to gain the place. DISKO TRIBUTE was bothered a bit by GABBY HAYES after the break, then got in tight quarters
after about a furlong and was hard to place, found himself boxed in through the whole of the turn and into the stretch, found a clear path in mid-stretch and
ran on but was just nabbed for second. SHARONA'S WILD BOY sped to the early lead, was joined by BETT ON BLAZE after a furlong, inherited the lead at
the quarter pole when that one gave way, fought on gamely but was passed late for third. GABBY HAYES was forced out at the break by MIKE DAD and
took up to avoid DISKO TRIBUTE, swung to the far outside for the run through the turn, made up some ground, came into the stretch run five wide and ran
on well despite idling late. TALISKER BAY lacked early speed, bided his time near the rear of the field to the turn, looked for clear running passing the
three-furlong marker but was boxed in, stayed to the inside once in the stretch but lacked the needed response once he had room to run. MIKE DAD broke
out, impeded GABBY HAYS at the break, checked near the five-furlong pole then once again a few yards later, saved ground through the turn, had to wait
for room in mid-stretch when behind the fading BETT ON BLAZE, swung out for room passing the eighth pole but had nothing left to offer at that point.
BETT ON BLAZE hustled for the lead and the rail position from the break, engaged in a speed duel with SHARONA'S WILD BOY through the turn then
began a steady fade with a quarter mile to go.
