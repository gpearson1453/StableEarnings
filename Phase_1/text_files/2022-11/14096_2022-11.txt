WEST WARPATH dueled early on while two wide, was in the two path into the lane with the lead but yielded late in the stretch run. LAKE TAHOE dueled
early on from the inside, stayed near the rail into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. PLEMMONSTON chased the pace early, raced in the three
path through the turn and flattened out late in the stretch. DESOTO'S WAR bobbled at the start and raced back early on, was in the two path along the turn,
on the inside into the lane and leveled off down the lane. CHASIN CHARLIE was never a factor. DUDLEY was done early.

but yielded late in the stretch run. BOUDIN chased the pace early, was in the three path along the turn, in the six path entering the lane and moved up late
in the stretch drive. VIOLENT RIVER was taken out at the start and trailed the field early on, raced in the seven path entering the lane, made a bid down the
lane but flattened out late in the drive. BRILLIANT COLORS tracked the pace early, raced from between horses along the turn, was in the two path into the
lane and weakened late in the stretch. FEELING bore in at the start and was done early. WHOOP GONE had brief speed from the inside then folded up.

RELEASE MCCRAKEN dueled early on two wide, was in the two path into the lane, shook clear near the eighth pole and held sway in the final stages.
GLOBAL SURPRISE chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, rallied down the lane and was gaining in the late stages. SIR trailed the field
early on, was in the seven path entering the lane with a belated gain in the stretch run. FIRST CLASS HARLOW raced back early on, was in the four path
along the turn, in the five path into the lane with a mild gain late in the stretch drive. SEAS OF NORMANDY dueled early on from the inside, stayed near the
rail into the lane and faltered late in the stretch. FIGHT FIERCELY shied from the rail along the backstretch, was a bit in tight entering the lane, was altered
to the inside and flattened out late in the stretch run. PAYNTED BLUE was a bit slow and bothered at the start, never a factor. WESTERN COMMAND was
done early. TAP DANCE TANGO was through after a half.
