XANTHE saved ground on the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead past the three
eighths, drew clear from the five sixteenths, widened at the rail on the far turn and was taken in hand the final sixteenth. LAUGHINTOTHEBANK rated just
off the pace in the two and three paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then dug in down the lane to take second
late yards. AMELIA'S DREAM settled inside on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn then
flattened the final sixteenth. BEST VIRGINIA stalked four wide on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole but steadied leaving the five
sixteenths, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened toward mid-stretch. LET'S DO THIS rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure nearing the
three eighths pole but gave up the lead leaving the pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. AWESOME MOON stalked from the
three path the first turn, challenged at the seven sixteenths pole but faded past the three eighths. The Stewards reviewed then dismissed a claim of foul
against the rider of Xanthe for alleged interference past the five sixteenths pole, lodged by the rider of Best Virginia.

SWEETONTHEGENTS took over nearing the half mile pole and was hand urged on the lead, dug in to the challenge of Travel Girl nearing the five
sixteenths pole, kept the edge at the rail on the turn and was steadily handled to hold on. TRUE HEIRESS exchanged contact with TRAVEL GIRL leaving
the gate then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the turn, angled to the four path leaving the turn, finished well to take
second inside the sixteenth pole and was gaining on the winner, while the latter exchanged contact with True Heiress leaving the gate then gave chase,
challenged toward the five sixteenths pole, remained close off the rail on the turn but ceded second mid-stretch and flattened later yards. CHEESE LOUISE
gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the four path and ran evenly in the lane. SUPER WILDCAT chased early, steadied past the five sixteenths pole,
raced at the rail on the turn then weakened. UNTOUCHED ELEGANCE chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn two deep, angled widest toward
the head of the lane and showed little more.

CURLIN'S DOVE took over nearing the three quarter pole and rated a short lead inside, came under pressure and dueled at even terms with Conductance
leaving the three eighths pole, recovered the edge at the rail midway on the turn, dueled clear while exchanging light contact with that one past the eighth
pole and held on well. DALLAS rounded the opening turn in the three path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the
far turn, eased out into the lane and dug in to take second the final yards. CODAS HONOR rounded the first turn in the four path, picked up the chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and finished well to take third the final yards while gaining on the runner-up.
CONDUCTANCE stalked the early pace inside then moved off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at even terms from
the three eighths, gave up the nod two deep midway on the far turn, exchanged light contact with Curlin's Dove past the eighth pole then flattened later
yards. IRISH SAMURAI became a bit fractious in the gate and was unprepared for the break then settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase leaving the

chase toward the three eighths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn. BLACK CURRENCY rounded the first turn in the five path, picked up the

OX DOC pressured the pace and dueled to a slim lead two deep midway on the turn, drew clear toward mid-stretch and was taken in hand late.
GLASTONBURY exchanged contact with Northern Tick Tock then engaged in close chase, raced off the rail on the turn, drifted into the stretch then dueled
through the final sixteenth for second. MI GUSTO ES took over approaching the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, was met at the rail
midway on the turn, outfinished in a later duel for second and just lasted for third. FANEUIL HALL chased, rounded the turn off the rail, eased out past the
eighth pole, finished well and just missed third. NORTHERN TICK TOCK exchanged contact with Glastonbury leaving the gate, picked up the chase through
the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail and ran evenly down the lane. IRISH MCDOUGAL chased well off the rail, rounded the turn in the four and
five paths and showed little in the lane. RIDUNCULOUS became fractious in the gate and came away rank, then never factored. MORNING ARTIE was
never a factor.

Footnotes
CHASE LIL ME settled back in the three path the first turn, bid leaving the half mile pole and steadily improved, raced in the three path of the far turn, dug in
under steady encouragement to take the nod inside the sixteenth pole and held on. REY O REYES closed to contention through the front stretch and
stalked off the rail, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole and contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, dueled to a brief slim lead
mid-stretch but grudgingly ceded later yards. MASTER THIS raced well off the pace about the five path on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole,
raced off the rail on the far turn, eased outward into the lane and came along for third the final yards. SALTY J J settled in the four path the first turn, gave
chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and ran evenly in the lane. A FAREWELL YODEL rated a short lead inside, came
under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, but was met toward mid-stretch and flattened the final
sixteenth. MASTER YOO raced well back in the five path the opening turn, left the turn outside then saved ground on the far turn and finished evenly to
pass rivals in the lane. PONTICELLO raced well off the pace about the four path the first turn and was not a factor. MR. HOSTLER saved ground on the first
turn and faded through the backstretch. Per HISA Ruling #8, Chase Lil Me is disqualified from earnings.
