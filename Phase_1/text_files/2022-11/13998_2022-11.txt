Footnotes
THUNDERING MARCH lagged back along the two path, responded, closed fast and then drifted out late bothering rivals late. LISTENING IN unhurried four
wide on the turn, angled out and rallied. PARS HEY ZEUS lagged back four wide, altered in at the furlong marker, rallied and then was forced out late by the
winner. MONTANA'SBIGSUNSET tracked, challenged from between, battled and then was forced out late by the winner. ITSYOUNOTME broke slow, close
up four wide into the turn, challenged three across at the top of the lane, battled and weakened. HE IS BONAFIDE set the pace along the rail, was hooked
at the top of the lane and faded. WILLIE MAYS HAYS broke slow, saved ground, was outrun. EXCEPTIONAL close up along the rail early and tired.
GREEK EASTER lagged far back, outrun. A claim of foul was lodged by the rider of ITSYOUNOTIME against MONTANA'SBIGSUNSET for interference
late, was not allowed.
