Footnotes
TOP NOTE stalked the two rival duel into the far turn while in the three path, bid nearing the five-sixteenth pole, cleared into the lane then drew off while
being ridden out. SATURN BOY vied for the lead along the inside into the far turn, was putting away challenger in mid-turn when passed by the winner,
chased that one through the lane and settled for second best. GO FOR IT was off the rail down the backstretch, raced four wide through the far turn, came
into the lane from the three path and never was a threat while being clear for the show spot. STEEL HAWK vied for the lead two wide into the far turn then
gave way in mid-turn. NEW ART was in the two path through the far turn and never was a factor. NOBLE CREEKER was in the four path into the far turn,
was asked for more approaching mid-turn then was done soon after.

Footnotes
CLASSIC MAX set the pace on a clear lead at once, entered the turn well off the inside and in the three path, continued in the three to the two path through
the turn when remaining clear, came into the lane from the five path and drew off when asked from the four path. D'ORO'S WISH raced in the five to the four
path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the five of six path and gained energy inside the eighth pole to just get up for the place
spot. CARAMELITO saved ground through the turn and into the lane, was closest to the winner with an eighth to go, could not gain on that one and lost the
place spot near the wire. A FEW TOO MANY chased the pace from the three path through the turn and into the lane and weakened. WHITE PIGEON
moved up in the two path through the turn to be a contender then tired after turning into the lane. AKAMAI pressed early while in the four path, continued in
the four path through the turn and was empty.

Footnotes
HE B READY was quickly clear while dropping over to the two path, continued on a clear lead into the lane, raced on his wrong lead after straightening in
the lane and extending his advantage then held clear. SECRET'S IMAGE was off with a slight hop and bumped soon after the start, raced in the two or
three path through the turn when never far back, moved closer to the inside for the stretch run and finished with good energy. BACKYARD JUSTICE chased
the pace from the three path through the turn, was asked for more nearing the five-sixteenths pole, continued in the three path into the lane while closest to
the winner, could not gain on that one and lost the place spot late. SECOND TO NO ONE hustled up into the turn while in four path, raced close up into the
lane while in the four path then flattened in the final eighth. CAMALEON chased the pace along the inside into the lane then weakened through the drive.
SAN RONIN was in the two path through the turn while trailing the field, came into the lane from the three path and showed belated energy.
DOUBLEDOGJUSTICE never a factor while along the inside through the turn. MYSTERY IMPACT was never a factor while in the three path through the
turn. CHARMING VICTORY in the three path through the turn then tired.

Footnotes
STARLET EXPRESS raced in the two path through the turn when never far back, angled into the three path entering the lane, gained the lead inside the
eighth pole then held to the wire. BOTOX KATIE was in the three to the two path through the turn when in mid-pack, came into the lane from the three or
four path, was taken up for two or three strides near the three-sixteenths pole, re-fired through the final eighth and was closing in to the wire.
AMAZINGNESS trailed into the lane while along the inside, rallied along the rail and finished with energy. LEXI SUN vied for the lead along the inside
through the turn and into the lane then gave way nearing the eighth pole. BREAKUP WITH TITOS chased the dueling leaders through the turn and into the
lane then weakened. GOT SPIRIT vied for the lead two wide into the lane, gained a short lead with an eighth to go then faltered. EXPRESS LADY chased
the pace from the three or four path through the turn then tired in the lane. VALSHEBA was in the two path through the turn and never was a factor. A
STEWARD'S INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #2 BOTOX KATIE AGAINST THE RIDER OF #6 STARLET EXPRESS RESULTED IN
#6 STARLET EXPRESS WHO FINISHED 1ST BEING PLACED 2ND FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE THREE-SIXTEENTHS POLE.

Footnotes
NOMADIC FIGHTER was bumped at the start, raced unrushed in the four path, bid at the three-eighths pole, dueled in the stretch and came in at the eighth
pole, then prevailed under mild urging. INGERSOLL was clear early in the two path, dueled through the stretch, was steadied at the eighth pole and
outfinished. SARGEANT BARGER stalked the pace inside, then faded in the stretch. ALTERNATE NIGHTS raced in the two path, fanned out in the four
path in the stretch and faded. BOURBON TRAFFIC was bumped at the start, raced in the three path and gave way on the turn. BEAR FORCE was hard to
load, broke outward, pressed the early pace three wide, then gave way nearing the far turn and was pulled up in the stretch, then was walked off. The
Stewards declined to take action following an inquiry and an objection by the rider of INGERSOLL against the winner concerning alleged interference near
the eighth pole.

SPEEDY DELIVERY led in the two path, was clear in the stretch and held sway under mild urging. VERRY AMELIA pressed the pace in the three path but
was no match late. CACTUS FLOWER pressed the pace in the four path, gave way in the stretch but held the show spot. SMOOTH JUSTICE stalked the
early pace between foes, angled five wide on the turn, rallied but couldn't close late. UNBRIDLED VICTORY pressed the early pace inside, then gave way
on the turn. TRAFALGAR SHORE raced evenly in the three path. SECRET SADIE saved ground to no avail. RUSSIAN INFLUENCE was through early.
LOOKIN ROYAL was fractious in the gate, then was off slowly.
