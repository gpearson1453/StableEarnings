Footnotes
COMPRESSED ENERGY was in the three path through the turn when unhurried, bid into the lane from the three path, caught the previous leaders just
inside the eighth pole then edged up on the next rival late. WILD TAPIT was unhurried while in the four path through the turn, bid into the lane from the four
path, had aim on the top two outside the eighth pole, was passing that duo when joined by the winner and could not keep that one at bay. DREAM STREAK
vied for the lead two wide through the turn and into the lane, was no match for the top two while staying on to save the show spot. PREMIER WISH saved
ground through the turn and into the lane, came off the rail inside the eighth pole and moved up while not a threat. DEEP DISH vied for the lead along the
inside through the turn and into the lane then gave way. SNOOTY was close early while in the two path then steadily faded. MOSE DEFINITELY trailed
throughout while in the four path through the turn.

Footnotes
LONGLEGGEDLAVERNE stumbled at the start, raced in the three path when never far back into the far turn, waited behind rivals through the turn, angled
in to the rail while straightening in the lane then finished with good energy to be going away late. THE BEAUTY'S TALE vied for the lead along the inside
through the far turn, gained the lead outside the eighth pole but was no match for the winner while staying on for the place spot. WHATS UP SWEETS was
in the five path through the the turn when in mid-pack, hustled to the lead down the backstretch, continued to vie for the lead into the lane and stayed on
well to just missed the place spot. CARRY ON raced in the four path through the turns while near the back, bid into the lane from the six path and moved up
while not a threat. COMPLETE stalked the pace while in the three path through the turn, continued a contender into the lane and was empty. HOT DAME
stumbled badly at the start and the rider lost his right iron, quickly replaced his boot in iron, raced in the back while in the two path and never made an
impact. OCELIA pressed the pace while along the inside early then faded after entering the lane.

Footnotes
GIMMEFUELGIMMEFIRE was off alertly to gain the lead at once, joined by another before the first call, raced under pressure through the turn, shook clear
into the lane, widened to the eighth pole then was kept to the task to hold. BRENTSPENCE was in the four path through the turn when never far back,
swung into the lane four wide, moved to the three path when gaining momentum, continued to gain on the leader through the final eighth and settled for
second best. COG was in the two path through the turn, shuffled back while others proceeded wide, cleared into the lane and moved up for the show spot
while not a threat to the top two. READY FOR MORE was in the three path through the turn and into the lane and lacked a closing response. INDIGO RICH
vied for the lead two wide through the turn then faded through the lane. BASSCOAT trailed for half while in the two or three path, bid into the lane from the
four path and was never a factor. GOODTIMEJUSTICE never a factor while in the two path. EVEN MONEY was done after going a half while along the
inside.

the two path as others swung wide, continued with good energy through the two path and was up for the place spot. PROTECTED AREA was in the two
path through the turn while on a clear lead, came into the lane from the four path with the lead then yielded late. PURSUANT raced in the four path through
the turn while never far back, came into the lane from the five path and lacked a finishing kick. COPPER HARBOR near rail through the turn and into the

SHARP JUSTICE chased the pace from the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and moved up for the place spot while not a
threat to the winner. LADY DONT MIND was in the three path through the turn while never far back, came into the lane from the two path and was up for the
minor share. REMEMBER ME FIRST raced in the four path through the turn and into the lane then faltered late. LOVE DRUNK in the three path through the
turn when well back, came into the lane from the six path and gained energy too late. MAGNIFICENTREVENGE saved ground into the lane and lacked a
bid. SAVEDBESTFORLAST never a factor while in the two path into the lane. TWO CARROT RANSOM was in the three path through the turn when well
back, came into the lane from the seven path and never factored. FLIRTY DANCER made little impact while saving ground. GIVEUSTHISDAY was in the
three or four path through the turn when near the back then tired after entering the lane. ROCK OF CASHEL vied for the lead while near the rail and was

Footnotes
B FLAT OUT vied for the early lead from the three path, cleared into the turn, widened into the lane then continued to slowly extend the advantage to the
end. CASTLE MAGIC vied for the lead along the inside early, chased the winner through the turn and into the lane while near the inside and could not gain
while second best. EXPLOSIVE SKIES was in the two path through the turn when in mid-pack, moved closer to the inside for the drive and offered a mild
gain. ALLABOUTTHEIMAGE was in the four path through the turn when near the back, came into the lane from the three path with a lot to make up, gained
energy after straightening in the lane and moved up while not a threat. ARRINGTON near the rail through the turn and moved up while not a menace. PAT'S
PALACE was in the four to the five path though the turn, came into the lane from the six path and lost ground through the lane. NO JOKING MATTER
drifted into the gap soon after the start, hustled up to bid into the far turn while near the inside, came off the rail for the drive and was suddenly empty inside
the eighth pole. PURELY MINE never a factor while in the three or four path through the turn. FAR'S LAST ONE never made an impact while in the three or
four path through the turn. CHIMES was outrun while saving ground. GIRLS ARE TUFFER chased the pace while near the inside through the turn and was
empty turning into the lane. ICEY ANGEL vied for the early lead then chased the leaders into the turn and dropped back while moving out from the two to
the four path.
