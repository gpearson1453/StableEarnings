Footnotes
HELLO HOT ROD set a pressured pace from the start, was well handled then was in a long drive in the stretch and held sway in the end. NUMBER ONE
DUDE chased the early pace while two wide on the backstretch, made a bid three wide on the far turn and was in a long drive but hung in late stretch.
PALUXY was unhurried early then rallied on the far turn, was three wide in the stretch and was no menace to the top two. MAN IN THE CAN pressed the
pace while two wide on the backstretch, was in a long drive then gave way. NEWSCASTER stalked the pace while inside, saved ground on the far turn and
lacked a rally in the stretch. DRIFTING WEST was unhurried early then failed to menace. GOLD MONEY chased the early pace while three wide, was used
up then gave way stopping to a walk in late stretch.
