Footnotes
DIA DE PAGO raced in the four path around the first turn, chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming
around the far turn, kicked clear under a drive in upper stretch and drew off, under wraps at the wire. K P AIM HIGH raced in the two path around the first
turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the far turn and chased the winner home, no match for that rival.
MAGIC IS FLYING raced in the middle of the pack in the three path through the opening half mile, angled in to save ground around the second bend and
finished evenly. AZTEC SUN hit the gate leaving it, trailed the field from the two path in the early going, began to move up while racing up the backstretch
and around the far turn and was outkicked in the lane. SMOKE STACK saved ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch and
around the far turn and tired in the stretch. CHARLIE DYNASTY raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up
the backstretch, came around the far turn still in the two path, swung wide into the stretch and was empty from there.

Footnotes
I'MAGAMBLER bumped with the horse to his inside in the opening strides, settled in the three path for the run around the first turn, stalked the leaders on
the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the three path, kicked clear in upper stretch and held that margin to the wire while drifting
mildly late. BEAR BRIAN dueled on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the second bend
and chased on to the wire. GOLDEN MERGER raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the pace setters between horses up the backstretch,
navigated the far turn from the three path and improved position mildly late. CEDAR EXTRA BOLD raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled on the
outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the second bend and weakened in late stretch. FORT STANTON SCOUT saved
ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and was outkicked in the
final furlong. JUVAL raced in the five path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn in
the four path and showed no kick. SUN TREADER raced in the four path around the first turn, switched to the inside while racing off the pace up the
backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and never threatened. THE TIME'S RIGHT bumped with the horse to his outside early, trailed the field from
the three path through the opening half mile, began to improve position while racing wide around the far turn, entered the stretch from the five path and
flattened out from there.

SHAME ON BEA led the way between horses up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and dug in gamely to hold the win. INDIAN
DIVA tracked the leader on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced in the three and four
path around the turn and gained ground in the stretch, narrowly missing. TIZ FOR REAL trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the five
path around the turn, swung wider still entering the stretch and gained ground late on the outside. SUPERBLEA raced in the middle of the pack on the
inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn, improved position in upper stretch and was outkicked. PEGGY B FAST raced in the middle of the
pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and finished evenly. DANSMETOTHENDOFLOV raced at the back of the pack
on the outside in the opening stages, began a bid from the four path approaching the quarter pole and flattened out in the final furlong. BIND ME UP raced
off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and made no bid. SATURNCLOUD chased the leaders on the inside
early, raced in the two path around the turn, swung wide into the stretch and tired from there.

MASK OFF pressed the pace on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and drew off in the lane. RIGHT JAB chased the
leader on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the three path around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and kept on
to the wire. WATFORD stalked the leader on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the four path and finished evenly. SUPER HUNK
bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, recovered to lead the way up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and faded in the
final furlong. I'M A COOL CAT bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, saved
ground around the bend and was outkicked from there. DAN WHO raced off the pace on the inside in the early going, came around the turn in the two path
and made no bid. REVOLT AND RIOT raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three and four path
and was empty in the stretch. BINGOS SYSTEM reared up leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and
was not a factor. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE START. UPON REVIEW, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT HORSE SEVEN, BINGOS
