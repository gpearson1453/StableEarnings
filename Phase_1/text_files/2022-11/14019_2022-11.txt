Footnotes
CAPTAIN COOL went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and was kept to the task. HARD CANDY pressed the early pace, eased back, made a late bid,
racing four wide, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. TEXAS TURBINE showed early speed, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a
late kick. STYLING HOOK lacked early speed, gained ground late, but was no real factor. WILLIE THE MAN pressed the pace, saved ground around the
turn and lacked a finish. VALDINA DREAMS lacked early speed, came around the turn on the outside, moved up, finished wide and went to the wire evenly.
SILVER CHALICE raced within striking distance, came around the turn wide and faded. ARKANSAS ZONG raced evenly near the back and showed little.
DABOOGEYMAN always raced near the back and was outrun.

raced near the back in the early part, made a mild bid, but proved no match for the top two. SPEAKTOMEOFLOVE drifted in early, challenged for the early
lead and faded down the home stretch. PACIFICISLANDTIME steadied, getting in tight quarters early, dueled on the front end and was finished early. WISE

Footnotes
TENSAS CANDY broke out, pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the home stretch and prevailed for the win. STELLAR LADY
unhurried in the early going, racing in the rear, moved up on the outside around the second turn, angled in down the stretch, was outfinished, while finishing
willingly. TAYLORS TAP showed early speed, drove clear, saved ground around the second turn, dueled down the lane and was outfinished, while putting
forth a game effort. OUTOFNOTHINGATALL pressed the early pace, faded, while racing inside around the final turn and lacked a late bid. LAYLALLEE
broke in, raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
SAVANNAH'S HERE went to the front, drove clear, led throughout, pulled away down the home stretch and was ridden out. ANGEL AND ME raced within
contention, came around the first turn on the outside, moved up around the final turn, made a bid down the lane, proved no match for the winner, but got by
TAP YOUR FRONT for second. TAP YOUR FRONT pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout and was a clear third at the wire, not being able to
hold off ANGEL AND ME for second. SEEMYVALENTINE was an early factor, weakened and finished evenly. CABEZA DE TORTUGA lacked early speed,
saved ground around the final turn, improved position, but was no factor. LUCKY DEAL raced near the back in the beginning, moved up, but was no threat.
A P HUMOR challenged on the front end and dropped back. MISS YELLOW MEADOW void of early speed and showed little. ELLIE'S TOUCH raced within
contention, came around the first turn on the outside and retreated. CHARMING KAT always raced near the back and was outrun.
