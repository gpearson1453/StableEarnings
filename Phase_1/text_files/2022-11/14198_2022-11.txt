Footnotes
CATATUMBO tracked the pace from the two path early, ranged up to bid four wide midway around the far turn, took the lead and opened up slightly going
into the lane, and maintained that advantage. CLEVER ENOUGH rated in the two path, was roused around the far turn, swung out to the seven path
entering the stretch, and rallied down the center to secure place honors. JERRY'S TURN stalked the pace from the two path, was short of room while in the
three path turning into the lane, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, but finished evenly to show. RACKET prompted the pace from the four path, bid
from two wide turning into the stretch, but was one paced. ALPHA BLUE set the pace from the two path, cut the corner turning into the lane, but yielded.
DUNKLE was held up along the inside but was never a threat. MY MOM WAS AWESOME had a hesitant start, trailed from the three path into the far turn,
and was no factor. WINGING IT raced in midpack from the five path but was tired after a half.

Footnotes
SCENIC VIEW set the pace in the two path, repulsed a bid late on the far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. TAKE THE
PODIUM settled off the pace while racing three wide, angled in in upper stretch and rallied inside of the winner. DUBSTEP was bumped at the start, raced in
range two wide, bid three wide around the far turn and was turned back in upper stretch. HARDSPUN WOMAN bumped DUBSTEP at the start, saved
ground off the pace, went two wide around the far turn and improved position in the lane. ROUGH ENOUGH chased the pace in the two path and lacked a
closing bid. HOLY BERRIES had brief speed inside. OLYMPIC FENCER stalked the pace three and four wide, stopped around he far turn, was eased
through the lane, pulled up soon after the wire and was vanned off.

Footnotes
BULLET ON TAP set the pace off the rail, was cued from the three path entering the stretch, opened up, and was much the best. BREEZY CONNECTION
tracked the pace in the four path, was roused into the stretch, and kept on for place. PRETTY FLATTERING bumped with an inner foe at the start, was
coaxed along from inside, cut the corner into the stretch, but finished evenly for show. KUKARO bumped with an outer foe at the start and was slow into
stride, trailed along the inside going into the turn, and passed tired rivals while in the three path in the stretch. ROSEISALWAYSRITE stalked from to the
three path early but began fading starting midway around the turn. SHOW ME LOVE brushed the gate at the start, chased from the five path but was no
factor. ALBA MIA had to be hustled along from the six path and backed up around the turn.

Footnotes
FRANKIE'S GIRL settled off the early pace in the two path, advanced four wide around the far turn, took the lead in upper stretch, vied outside of
CURRENT SIUTATION to deep stretch and held firm between foes late. SHE FLED THE SCENE raced off the pace three and four wide and rallied outside.
CURRENT SITUATION stalked the pace in the three path, bid between foes turning for home and fought on inside of the winner to deep stretch.
PEARLESCENT raced in range inside, cut the corner into the lane to reach near even terms in upper stretch then weakened through the final furlong.
MONEY FACTOR had her head turned at the start then hopped to get away several lengths last, saved ground off the pace and never threatened.
MORNING COLORS set a clear pace in the two path and tired in the lane. FLASHY TOO played no factor while racing two and three wide. SPLICER was
outrun inside.

Footnotes
NO DECAF stalked in the two path, tipped out and ranged up to bid from the four path turning into the stretch, and drifted out while drawing clear in the final
furlong. DEMURELY set the pace along the inside, was coaxed from the two path midway around the turn, kept on in the stretch, but was second best.
SHE'S OUTTA HERE chased from the four path early, was ridden two wide around the turn, shifted to the rail in upper stretch, and got up for show honors.
WIN OR CELLAR prompted the pace from the four path but weakened in the stretch. BE NAUGHTY WITH ME rated from the three path early, was driven
along while drifting out to the seven path going into the stretch, and was no factor. UNBRIDLED CHROME trailed from inside going into the turn and was
never a threat. UNCAPTURED FAITH pressed the pace in the three path but gaveway turning into the lane.

VAI BELLA set a pressured pace in the two path, kicked clear nearing the eighth pole and held clear under a drive. FOREVER UNCAPTURED pressed the
winner in the three path, could not match strides in upper stretch but stayed to hold the place. JENNY STAMP hesitated at the start, saved ground off the
pace, tipped two wide near the quarter pole and rallied for the show. WISE AND ELEGANT stalked the pace in the four path, could not match strides with
the two in upper stretch and just missed third. WITCHING HOUR failed to menace while racing five wide. GRAND SPUN chased the pace from the rail and
came up empty in the lane. EMALTHA chased the pace two wide, got out near the quarter pole, was corrected and angled back in in upper stretch and had
no further bids.

FROSTED ARMOUR set the pace along the inside, was cued and opened up turning into the stretch, and held sway. CELESTIAL GLAZE rated in the three
path, moved up while coaxed along from the five path around the turn to take aim entering the stretch, and ran on for place. WIND NINETY NINE prompted
the pace between rivals, shifted out to the three path in the final furlong, and finished evenly for show. KHOZY MY BOY pressed the pace in the three path
but faded going into the stretch. MAN ON THE MOON stalked from inside, checked going into the turn, swung out to the six path turning into the lane, but
was no factor. KING CAIRO tracked in the four path, steadied slightly midway around the turn, and weakened in the stretch. NIXON JOY (ARG) trailed
throughout.

UNSOCIABLE settled off the early pace in the three path, advanced four wide around the turn, struck the front leaving the sixteenth pole, vied to the wire
and prevailed. DETROIT CITY stalked the pace three wide, took over near the quarter pole, led to the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly inside of the
winner. WAR STRATEGY raced off the pace inside, stayed at the rail in the lane and was along for the show. SAINTHOODFORBRIAN failed to menace
while racing four wide. PSYCHEDELIC SHACK dueled in the two path to midstretch and tired. INVISIBLE WAR played no factor while racing two wide.
TETRAGRAMMATON chased the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane. GONE NUTS vied inside and faltered nearing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
MEDIATION was held up from the three path around the first turn, took over the lead from said position down the backstretch, opened up slightly turning into
the lane, but began to tire in deep stretch and just held on. SING SCAT tracked the pace from the four path, ranged up around the far turn took take aim
from the five path entering the stretch, and ran on for place. RESONANCIA led from the two path around the first turn, took back to press the eventual
winner down the backstretch, was coaxed from the three path into the lane, and kept on to hold show. REBATE rated in the four path early, moved up
rounding the far turn, was ridden from the six path into the stretch, and finished evenly. GRAND ARROW stalked along the inside early but was empty going
into the stretch. KHARKIV raced from wellback in the two path and was no factor. SPRINT BREAKER raced in midpack between rivals but faded around the
far turn. GLADIATORA trailed from the six path going into the far turn and was never a threat. CAIRO WINNER chased from the five path early but was no
menace.
