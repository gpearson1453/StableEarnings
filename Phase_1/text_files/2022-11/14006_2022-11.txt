UNDERVALUED ASSET lost her footing ever so slightly while breaking in second position from the outside, pressed the pace on the outside of the leader,
turned up the pressure under her own power in the three path around the turn, took the advantage at the quarter-pole, kicked clear when set down in upper
stretch, swapped leads back and forth in the vicinity of the furlong marker, was given one pop of a right-handed crop while drawing away outside the
sixteenth-pole, widened under a solid hand-ride into the final seventy yards then was eased up while much the best. RISK FREE broke out and hit the gate
then bumped with a foe, settled on the inside, moved out leaving the backstretch, gained three then four wide around the turn, chased five wide into the
stretch and proved no match for the winner while finishing willingly to safely secure the place. BILOXI BLUES broke in then bumped with an opponent, was
urged to establish position early then settled into a comfortable stride, went around the turn in the two path while in dead-aim of the leaders, shifted four
wide while asked outside the quarter-pole, chased into upper stretch and weakened while clear for the show. PARDON MOI was away alertly, set the pace
under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead to the winner at the quarter-pole and faded. AUDIT COMMITTEE bumped with
foes on both sides at the start, was urged along near the back, dropped to the rear in the two path on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
HE'SGOTTASHORTFUSE chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to steadily gain
through the final furlong collaring the leader seventy yards from home, dug in and prevailed safely over a late bidding rival on the wire. PAPI ON ICE chased
along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, offered up late foot to miss at the end. GENESIS ONE
stumbled at the start, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid.
SUPER QUALITY bumped at the start by SEAN THE HAMMER and in turn bumped DISENGAGE, prompted the leader from the outside five then four wide,
advanced to take command at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in leg weary and was caught
seventy yards from the finish. PSYCHIC INCOME four then three wide in closest aim of the early leader, took over with seven-sixteenths to go and tucked to
the two path at the three-eighths, yielded the front himself at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong.
SMART JOKER chased along the inside early on and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into
upper stretch and offered no response. SEAN THE HAMMER got bumped at the start by GRAND AGAIN and in turn bumped SUPER QUALITY into
DISENGAGE, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and made no headway. DISENGAGE
bumped at the start, chased six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the
seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. GRAND AGAIN bobbled at the start recovering outwards into SEAN THE
HAMMER, showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from a pair, got overhauled with seven-sixteenths to run, retreated through the turn
and went four to five wide at the top of the stretch, then tired in the drive.

gained the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best under strong urging. ICE COLD GOLD went to the front from the outside, moved clear
near the five-eighths pole, controlled the action in the two path around the turn, was asked in the three path into the stretch, led under a drive into the final
furlong then was overtaken while able to hold the place. APRIL ANTICS broke out at the start, settled off the pace, was urged along while moving from three
to five wide around the turn, came seven wide into the stretch, gained outside into the final furlong and finished willingly for the show. MY BEAUTY
PRINCESS was hustled from the gate, moved in while showing speed, raced just off the pace, chased inside on the turn, pursued the leader under a drive
into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick then missed the show. SIMPLE SUGAR bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, moved up under
urging, went two to three wide for most of the turn then shifted five wide, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SWEETER broke out and
bumped with a foe, was urged along off the pace, moved closer late on the backstretch, chased three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and
tired. ICE KREEM SUNDAE was bumped at the start and forced out while last to commence, raced at the rear under urging on the outside, went five to six
wide on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and was no factor. RAINING CANDY was well placed down the backstretch, dropped back near the

Footnotes
PALACE GOSSIP tracked the pace along the inside from the pocket coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch
following the leader before tipping to the two path straightened away, dug in under a drive heads apart for command a furlong out, seized the front narrowly
a sixteenth from home dueling to the finish and gamely prevailed on the wire. ROAD TO REMEMBER prompted the leader from the outside in the two path
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from home, came inwards forcing the
aforementioned foe in slightly while dueling to the finish and was headed a sixteenth out, fought on game but was ultimately bested at the end.
ITSAKEYPER chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide for home, ran on to secure the show honors. DERRYNANE
chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly for the last major share.
BLAME IT ON MARY showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from ROAD TO REMEMBER to the outside, came under coaxing near the
quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and was displaced from the front just outside the eighth pole, then
weakened in the late stages. SOCIAL WHIRL just off the pace three wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch,
weakened in the late going. KOKOPELLI chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths and offered no response. TOWERING ORBIT
chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper
stretch and offered no rally, then got pulled up soon after the finish and was subsequently vanned off. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS chased two to three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. CAPTAINSDAUGHTER chased two to three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, went four to five wide for home and trailed throughout.

through quick fractions, responded well when set down a bit off the rail into upper stretch, shortened stride into the final furlong, led to the sixteenth-pole but
was overtaken while just able to hold the place. ARUBA went around the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside without cover, was asked in the two
path on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, gained into the final furlong and just missed the place while clear for the show. INDEMNIFY (FR) was
bumped in the hindquarters at the start, raced in the three path around the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked in the two path on the far turn, moved
out in upper stretch, shifted further out in the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. CAPTAIN QUICK broke in at the start, settled on the inside, was given
his cue on the final turn, moved out into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. CLEAT prompted the fast pace on the outside in the three path,
shortened stride under a drive in upper stretch and tired. CELESTIAL MOON bumped with a rival at the start, went three wide on the turns, came five wide
into the stretch and failed to threaten. STJAMES was last to commence then urged along early, raced inside to the two path on the turns and was no factor.
BALI RIDDIM was hustled from the gate, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was urged along while saving ground on the far turn and
failed to respond. EQUALJUSTICEFORALL was bumped on both sides at the start, went four wide on the turns, came six wide into the stretch and failed to
impact.
