Footnotes
NEW YORK DREAMS (GB) broke a step slow then went up to take control, cleared the field past the five-eighths pole, padded the lead on the turn under
coaxing, then drew off under mild urging. IVORY SKY trailed up the backstretch, went two wide into the turn, angled out around the bend and entered the
lane widest of all, rallied through the drive and gained second. MIDNIGHT MAJESTY chased between leaving the backstretch, got bumped on both sides at
the three-eighths pole, moved to the rail around the bend, lacked the needed late kick in the drive and was outkicked for second. PRECEDENT came away
well from inside then chased the pacesetter from inside, got bumped entering the turn, put in tight and shuffled back a bit at the five-sixteenths pole, tipped
out into the lane and churned on for a minor award. SYNNIN AND WINNIN had early speed then balked at the dirt crossing to lose some ground, chased
three deep then got bumped by CHICAGO SOLDIER (IRE) at the seven-sixteenths pole, bumped with inner rival entering the turn, moved into the two path
around the bend, then flattened in the drive. CHICAGO SOLDIER (IRE) stumbled leaving the gate, chased four deep early, drifted in and bumped rival at the
seven-sixteenths pole, rounded the bend four then three wide, moved out into the stretch, was bothered from outside at the top of the lane and faded.

Footnotes
COMMANDER CARL sped clear and crossed over to the inside, led through the turn then met the challenge from FAMOUS STAR leaving the turn,
responded when called upon and drew clear to prove best. FAMOUS STAR bumped leaving the gate, chased the lone leader up the backstretch on the
inside into the turn, moved out and engaged the COMMANDER CARL leaving the turn, lugged out past the eighth pole and could not match the winner late.
TENTH STREET DON got pinballed and had take up at the start, dropped back early, went two wide inside a rival into the turn, moved out to the three path
around the bend, tipped out in the lane and bested the rest. APFEL stalked the speed outside a rival to the turn, chased three then four wide around the
bend and weakened. STRAIGHTTODASOURCE brushed the gate and bumped with TENTH STREET DON at the start, tracked three deep in the early
going, rounded the bend four then five wide and weakened down the lane. HONEYMOON SUITE broke in and bumped rival while tossing his head, raced
off the pace three wide into the turn, moved out and entered the lane five wide and failed to menace. MASTERMIND bumped in the beginning, chased out
of range along the rail then eased out to the three path around the turn and weakened.

bumped leaving the gate, chased MARKS HIP from between early, was closest in pursuit two wide around the bend, took aim in the stretch but lacked the
needed late kick. BIZZY GAL bumped with MISTER BEAMS at the start, got shuffled between rivals crossing the dirt and dropped back, gained on the
inside through the turn but flattened in the late stages. CHICK'S DIG IT was off slow to start, moved into striking position inside a pair of rivals, drifted out

HIALEAH HOTTIE stepped to the front immediately, set the pace up the backstretch while moving over to the inside, continued under a confident ride
through the turn, given her cue in upper stretch and stayed clear when shown the whip and steady handling. LOVE OUR FAMILY was closest in pursuit
from outside up the backstretch, rounded the bend two wide, chased determinedly through the lane but could not reach the winner. ROYALE FLARE stalked
along the inside into the turn, eased out and came three wide into the stretch, could not summon the needed the response but churned on to hold the show.
SHORT JOURNEY traveled near the back early on, went three then two wide around the bend and failed to threaten. ANACARAVA (IRE) dropped back to
last early, saved ground on the inside and was always outrun. DRAW NEAR chased off the rail up the backstretch, two then three wide on the turn and
faded in the drive.

Footnotes
LIBERTY FOREVER prompted the pace from outside, put a head in front at the five-sixteenths pole, cleared leaving the bend and held well under a drive to
the line. RESILIENT broke awkwardly to come away a step slow, chased two wide around the bend, tipped out at the top of the stretch then angled back to
the inside and finished gamely for the place. CATEMACO unhurried in the beginning while traveling wide, rounded the bend five deep and finished willingly
for the show honors. EXCEED SPEED LIMIT raced in range three deep early on, took aim three wide into the stretch and could not produce a bid. I KNOW
CASH FLOW stalked four deep in the early going, continued in the four path to the stretch and flattened in the final sixteenth. NICE GUY CLAY sent for the
lead early, set the pace while under pressure from the winner on the outside, lost command midway around the turn, stayed on to the top of the stretch and
weakened down the lane. PRAYER OF JABEZ was hard to load then ran through the gate when the assistant starter opened the front, taken behind and
reloaded again, lost his footing at the start, moved into range under a hold on the inside, got boxed in along the rail through the turn and had to wait, gained
a clear path in the lane but was too late to summon a rally.

Footnotes
RIP CITY sped to the front, cleared and moved inside, held command while pressured by GYPSY KING in the middle stages, moved clear around the far
turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and held well in the final sixteenth. COUNT OF AMAZONIA (IRE) settled early on the inside, moved closer into the far
turn, cut the corner into the stretch and outkicked EARLS ROCK (IRE) for second. EARLS ROCK (IRE) was keen early along the inside into the first turn,
lacked room past the five-sixteenths pole, entered the lane two wide, finished willingly through the final furlong and got edged for the place. ZOFFARELLI
(IRE) stalked the pace outside a rival in the two path, traveled between into the second bend, came three wide into the drive, lacked room in upper stretch,
steered inward then lacked room in the final sixteenth and kept on to hold a minor award. GYPSY KING bumped outer rival at the start, stalked two wide
then applied pressure on the backstretch, lost touch then re-engaged on the far turn, could not keep up while three wide exiting the bend and weakened in
the final furlong. VANTASTIC dropped back early and trailed two wide into the first turn, moved out and went three deep into the far turn, came four wide
into the lane, tipped out in upper stretch and failed to menace. FLASHIEST got bumped back at the start, stalked in the two path early, moved out on the
backstretch went three wide into the far turn, spun four wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
CROWNING GOLD brushed early, vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals up the backstretch, inched ahead on the turn, kicked clear at the three-sixteenths
pole and was kept to task to the wire. PACIFIC STATES broke in and bumped rival, stalked the leading trio from outside, navigated the bend four wide,
drifted inward in the lane and held the place. SPIRITIST got bumped soon after the start then was forced to check back, raced wide to the turn, came five
wide into the drive, drifted inward while closing in tandem with PACIFIC STATES and got edged for second. NAPOLEONIC CODE brushed with the winner
early, stalked the top trio a bit off the rail around the turn, angled to the fence entering the stretch and lacked a rally. VINNY THE COIN got knocked into rival
at the start, vied for the lead between foes into and around the turn, failed to keep up in upper stretch and weakened down the lane. SIPPIN WHISKEY was
off slow and broke inward, trailed on the inside then two wide leaving the bend and never got involved. MOBE TOWN got knocked into rival leaving the gate,
went up to vie three deep up the backstretch, fought three wide through the turn, then gave way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
DOC ADAMS chased two then three wide early, bid three deep on the far turn and got floated out to the six path around the bend, battled from outside
through the final furlong and dug in to get up. HIGH HEATER stalked outside a rival early, moved up to apply pressure on the backstretch, vied between
rivals while getting floated out five wide on the far turn, took over in upper stretch and yielded grudgingly late. BACK RING LUCK sped clear in the three
path early, showed the way two wide into the far turn, drifted out four wide on the second bend while holding a short lead, lost the lead in upper stretch but
battled back through the final furlong and went gamely to the wire. BIG BUZZ unhurried in the early going and moved inside, steered out on the backstretch,
went three wide around the far turn, closed well inside the top trio but ran out of time. OUTRIGHT bumped leaving the gate, went four wide into the first turn
then angled down to the two path, traveled in mid-pack early on, asked three then two wide on the second bend and flattened in the drive. HOLIDAY
AROUSAL pulled early and was taken in hand on the inside early, remained inside into the stretch and also flattened. LITTLE DEMON chased six wide into
the clubhouse turn then moved down to the four path, continued out wide and rounded the far turn five then six wide and could not respond when called
upon. TODAY MATTERS trailed two wide around both turns and made no impact. ZIMBA WARRIOR chased three wide then angled to the rail around the
first turn, came three wide into the lane and never threatened.

Footnotes
COCKTAIL PRINCESS set the pace inside a pair of rivals up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, shook free under left and right handed urging
and coasted in late. NYVAN raced up close between early, pursued the leader two wide to the stretch, was no match for COCKTAIL PRINCESS in the lane
but stayed on to secure the place. MOOREA TIME settled in the early going, moved closer three wide through the turn, steered out in the lane and finished
willingly but was unable to gain the place. GOLDEN TEMPER raced up close three deep then dropped back to stalk the top trio, chased in the two path
around the bend, went between foes in the stretch and earned a minor award. CAROLE LOMBARD was off slow to begin, raced inside a rival at the back,
between foes into the turn, spun three wide into the lane and summoned a mild rally. TURN OF FOOT bobbled crossing over the dirt, sat off the pace on the
inside to the stretch, tipped out in the lane and improved. SARANDE raced up close from outside early then three deep into the turn, chased the winner
three wide to the stretch and weakened. SMILING AMY was off slow to begin, moved into range on the inside, remained along the fence around the turn
and down the stretch while weakening. CHERRY CHAOS steadied off heels early, chased off the rail then steadied again entering the turn, got blocked past
the quarter pole, tipped out but had little left for the drive. VACANT SEAT was off slow in the beginning, chased outside a rival at the back early on, entered
the turn three deep, exited the bend two wide and was never a factor.
