MO NIGHEAN DONN Vied for the lead along the rail, kicked clear after a half mile, opened up long lead nearing the quarter pole and then widened as much
the best. ALL BIZZ Lagged back four wide, gained on that path around the final turn, chased to no avail but bested the rest. UNBRIDLED'S REIGN In hand
along the rail, three path into the last turn, four wide out of it and weakened. SO ARE YOU In hand along the three path, four wide into the lane and tired.
TINTAGEL Vied for the lead three across early, tracked the leader after a half mile and tired. KITTY TIN TIN Extremely hard to load in the gate, two path
after a half mile and was done into the final turn.

Footnotes
ROZ Close up, gained along the three path into the turn, took command, opened up some and then drifted out leaving the sixteenths pole taking away the
path of FLATTER'S MUSIC but clear of the second place rival. BECKY'S MISSION In hand four wide into the turn, three path around it, lodged a bid outside
and earned the place. FLATTERY'S MUSIC Angled to the rail at the half mile pole, two path midway around the bend, chased outside and then checked
late. LILLIA PRANCES Unhurried, saved ground and failed to take part. BISTRITA Lagged back, saved ground, was not a factor. MISS CIRCULAR GAL
Vied for the lead along the rail and gave way. BEAUTIFUL BANKS Forced the issue early, two path into the turn and tired. GET YOUR GOLD Close up
early, three path into the turn, five wide out of it and tired.
