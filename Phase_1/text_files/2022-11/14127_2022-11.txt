and drew past in the final furlong. CHEF MENTEUR bumped an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace from the four path, took the lead while two wide
turning into the stretch, and kept on but was second best. VOICE OF NOW set the pace in the two path, cut the corner into the stretch, gave way in the final
furlong, but held on for show. IMPETUOUS SOUL chased from three wide, was hustled around the far turn, took aim from the five path entering the lane,
but was one paced. EDEN PARADISE trailed from the two path early and was never a threat. SIR BITESALOT was bumped on both sides at the start,
stalked from inside, steadied to shift out to the five path early around the far turn, but was empty in the stretch.

CAGED PIXIE dueled two wide between foes to upper stretch, dueled inside of CAPRIDREY to deep stretch then drew clear late. CAPRIDREY dueled three
wide between foes to upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane, led outside of the winner past the sixteenth pole and weakened late. LOOK UP
TO HEAVEN dueled inside of foes while hugging the rail and weakened in the lane. ELLIEREESEASTON pressed the pace four wide and faded in the lane.
LITTLE BELITA steadied at the start, had early speed between foes, chased in the three path around the turn and lacked a closing bid. THRILLING BABY
broke awkwardly and trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
GAM GAM JOANN bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked from the four path, ranged up to take aim around the turn, bid from the six path in the
stretch, and drifted in while drawing past an inside rival in the final furlong. SPEIGHTFUL SIS led while two wide, was ridden from the three path into the
lane, and ran on to secure place. AVE FENIX raced in midpack from the two path, swung out to the six path entering the stretch, and kept on down the
center for show. OAXACA pressed from inside early, dropped back around the turn, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch, and finished evenly. FEEL
LIKE GUESSING chased from inside, but was one paced while in the four path through the lane. VELOCISSIMA bumped with an inner foe at the start,
stalked from the three path early but yielded in the stretch. A PERFECT SET raced from wellback in the four path and was never a threat. RAIN OF
BLESSING was in the three path early but was always behind.

VANDALIA stalked the pace four wide, was bumped entering the far turn, bid three wide around that bend, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, vied
to midstretch and edged ahead in the final furlong. PACIFIC PRINCESS dueled inside, could not quite keep pace in upper stretch but fought on inside to
regain the place. ROSA STAR disputed the pace two wide to deep stretch and was outfinished. KENTUCKY PRIDE raced in range while five wide around
both turns and a mild stretch rally. LA COSTA was up close two and three wide and lacked the needed rally. RUBYSA was in touch while racing three wide
between foes, bumped the winner entering the far turn, went four wide around that bend and never threatened.

pace, bid from three wide around the turn, but flattened down the lane. FUNTASTICA trailed from the six path early and was no threat. CONDESCENDING
set the pace from inside but gaveway around the turn. LITTLELADYISAWOMAN rated in the three path but was no menace.

Footnotes
LORD MILES broke sharply but soon dropped off the pace, bumped near the nine-sixteenths marker, was urged along in midpack while racing three and
four wide around the turn, kicked in in upper stretch and surged clear. BIG DATA hit the starting gate to get off a bit slowly, advanced three wide around the
turn, took the lead in upper stretch, was no match for the winner in the final furlong but stayed on for the place. THERE BE DRAGONS raced off the pace
four wide and was along for the show. DEVIL'S CAY tracked the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. IMMENSE FAITH had early speed inside, dropped
back around the turn then improved position in the lane. MR BRIZEL played no factor while racing two wide. VAMOS VIEJO vied two wide, drew clear
nearing the quarter pole and tired in the lane. POINT LIAM dueled inside and faltered nearing the quarter pole. DARE DREAM DO bumped with the winner
near the nine-sixteenths marker, steadied near the seven-sixteenths pole, raced three wide around the turn and never threatened.

Footnotes
NAVY GOAT hit the side of the gate at the start, was held up while racing in the three path early, shifted in and was coaxed to bid from the rail entering the
lane, and drew clear. OH DARLIN set the pace in the two path, was roused from the three path into the stretch, and dug in to hold place. LUCK IN THE
DUSK rated while three wide, swung out to the six path turning into the stretch, bumped with an inner rival at the top of the lane, and kept on for show.
STUCK IN MALIBU stalked in the four path, was ridden from the five path entering the lane, was in tight and bumped between rivals at the top of the stretch,
and finished evenly. LA PANDA prompted the pace in the three path, was hustled from the four path into the stretch, but faded. EXTRA INDY chased from
two wide but was empty in the stretch. ESOTERIC hit the side of the gate at the start, was hard held while tracking from the rail, steadied and shifted outside
around the far turn, but was no factor.

Footnotes
ALLURAMORE vied inside of foes down the backstretch, was in tight near the half-mile pole, rated back, angled four wide near the three-eighths pole,
quickly moved to the front and drew off under a drive. SOUL OF AN ANGEL was bumped hard on both sides at the start, dropped far back inside, swung out
near the three-sixteenth pole and ran on to gain the place late. OFFALY FAST stalked the pace four wide, advanced three wide around the turn, took the
lead nearing the quarter pole, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch and lost second late. POIEMA set a pressured pace between rivals down
the backstretch, vied along the rail around the turn and tired in the lane. RUNNING LEGACY broke out and bumped at the start, raced three wide and never
threatened. NINJA ABARRIO came in and bumped at the start, raced two wide and played no further factor. TOWSER stalked the early pace, bid nearing
the far turn, vied two wide between foes around much of the bend and stopped nearing the quarter pole.

the two path, was cued entering the lane, and ran on but was second best. SONICUS tracked in the two path and kept on in the stretch to win a head bob
for show. SEQUIN LADY chased in the four path and stayed on through the lane but lost the show bob. DEMOGORGON trailed from the four path early and
finished evenly in the stretch. TEMPORA raced in midpack from the three path but flattened in the stretch. VIGIL ANNA rated in the two path, shifted out to
the five path entering the lane, but was one paced. PARCHITA was wellback in the five path but was no threat. I SAID HEY prompted the pace from inside
but was empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
ANAMNESTIC settled off the pace inside, swung five wide near the quarter pole, came seven wide into the stretch, closed well while steadily drifting inward
through the lane to end up in the three path, took the lead near the sixteenth pole and inched ahead. DANGEROUS RIDE tracked the pace inside and
finished well along the rail. BIG SAVE stalked the pace three wide, reached near even terms near the five-sixteenths pole, vied between foes in the lane and
bumped with CHEERFUL CHARLIE late. CHEERFUL CHARLIE set the pace in the two path, fought on between foes in the lane and was bumped late.
SOUPER BLESSING raced in range three wide, tipped further out in upper stretch, was forced to steady when ANAMNESTIC came in leaving the eighth
pole, angled out not long after and gained ground late. CAPTAIN ANTHONY was fractious in the gate, broke awkwardly, trailed in the two path for six
furlongs, angled out in the stretch and rallied belatedly. TIGRE failed to menace while racing four and five wide. MAXIMO was outrun while racing in the two
path.

Footnotes
PACO'S PICO tracked in the five path, took over from the four path entering the stretch, opened up at the top of the lane, and held sway. LUDINGTON
chased in the two path, was driven along in the five path entering the lane, and drifted out through the stretch while running on for place. GRAINGER
COUNTY trailed from the six path early and finished evenly in the stretch for show. ENBARR stalked in the four path but backed up around the turn. TOO
MUCH ACTION rated in the four path but flattened down the stretch. MEETMEINKINGSTON dueled for the lead from two wide but gaveway entering the
lane. CONCRETE GLORY dueled for the lead from inside but yielded around the turn.
