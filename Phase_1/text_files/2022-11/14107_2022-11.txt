the start, racing near the back, came around the first turn wide and was no threat. KEEP ON DREAMING went to the front and dropped back.

Footnotes
KANCANCUTIE raced within contention, entered the stretch three wide, rallied and proved the best late. ARMS APRIORITY vied for the early lead, saved
ground around the turn, took the advantage, but proved no match for the winner late. MISS S T LEE dueled on the front end, forwardly placed throughout
and lacked a late kick. SAUCY pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn, lacked a rally, while putting forth an even effort. PIECE OF ME raced
evenly near the back and showed little. CAUGHT MY HEART raced within striking distance, came around the turn on the outside and faded. CALIFORNIA
CALI always raced near the back and showed little.

outside around the turn and went to the wire evenly. SUMMERTIME BANDIT went to the front, drove clear, saved ground around the turn and weakened.

CLASSIC RED RACER shot to the front, drove clear, led until late, couldn't hold off GILDERSLEEVE for the win. G E H GIANTS WAY pressed the pace,
forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for the top two. BARNEY'S PASSION raced within contention, came around the turn on the outside and
finished evenly. FIGHTING SOLDIER raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the turn and put forth an even effort. ISLE CALL U LATER raced
within contention, weakened and was no threat late. DRESSED IN LOUIE lacked early speed and raced evenly near the back. KINGDOM STAR broke
through the gates before the start, raced in the back, came around the turn wide and was never close. BERSERKO always raced near the back, came
around the turn wide and showed little.
