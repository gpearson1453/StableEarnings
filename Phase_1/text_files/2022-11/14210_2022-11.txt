Footnotes
ARDIS sped clear and crossed over, set the pace on the inside to the stretch, put to right handed urging in the final furlong and was never challenged.
BLAME IT ON ROSE tracked the pace on the inside into the turn, eased out and came three wide into the lane and rallied for second. HAIL COLUMBIA was
closest in pursuit stalking the leader in the two path, continued to give futile chase through the lane and lost the place. SANGRE AZUL sat off the pace early
on, went two wide into the turn, angled out and came four wide into the stretch, churned on down the lane but needed to find more late. LILLY BABE lacked
early speed, raced three deep into the turn, came six wide into the stretch and could not rally. TIZZY TWISTER unhurried in the beginning, entered the turn
between foes then came four wide into the drive and lacked further response. SPRING SPINNING was along the rail while off the pace into the turn, exited
the bend two wide and failed to menace.

Footnotes
TONY ANN broke a step slow, stalked on the inside to the stretch, waited briefly in traffic behind the leader in upper stretch, gained a clear path when that
rival moved out, rallied up the fence and edged away late. BRANDON'SMYLAWYER pressed the pace from outside, lost touch with the leader and chased
two wide into the drive, re-engaged BULLETPROOF ONE at the eight pole, took a brief lead with a sixteenth to go but was soon overtaken by TONY ANN
and saved the place. ALICE MARBLE brushed leaving the gate, allowed to settle at the back then got bothered by CAROLINA MIA coming out past the
half-mile pole, raced on the inside then two wide into the stretch, angled out in the lane, rallied and missed the place. CAROLINA MIA brushed leaving the
gate, chased two wide into the turn, moved out and was asked right handed three wide around the bend and could not rally in the drive. BULLETPROOF
ONE cleared early and crossed over to the inside while in hand, was soon pressured from outside, moved clear into the stretch, challenged again at the
eighth pole, relinquished the lead at the sixteenth pole and weakened.

Footnotes
AMERICAN CAT dueled for command from outside, inched ahead at the three-eighths pole, put away inner rival late on the turn, put to right handed urging
in the lane and held safely. LEMON DROP SHOT broke out and bumped rival, trailed early, went two wide into the turn, advanced inside rivals on the bend,
steered out in the lane, put in a late run and proved second best. IRONDALE dueled for the lead from inside, kept the pressure on around the bend then lost
touch with the winner late on the turn, chased through the lane and flattened to third. CAROL'S COMIC broke out a bit but was quickly corrected, chased
inside then off the rail, shifted out entering the turn then steered down to the inside, kept on through the lane to earn a minor award but never threatened.
AGADOR SPARTACUS lacked early speed well off the rail, rounded the bend four to five wide, had the rider lose the whip outside the sixteenth pole and
could not rally. VALIENTE got bumped both sides at the start, chased under coaxing off the rail, got floated out by inner rival at the three-eighths pole,
angled down to the two path, found the rail in the stretch and could not summon the needed response. WEGONAHAVAGOODTIME got bumped on both
sides at the start, stalked on the inside then tipped out and came three wide into the stretch, bumped DAD BOD in upper stretch and weakened. DAD BOD
bumped with inner rival at the start, stalked two wide into the turn, entered the lane four wide, bumped with inner rival in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
SECRET FIX chased for a bit then went up to take over at the nine-sixteenths pole, cleared outside pair into the turn, inched away on the turn, then widened
in the stretch when asked with the right hand and was ridden out to the wire. SUPER RENEE was a bit rank then steadied behind a rival early, steered down
to the inside, moved into range on the turn, failed to launch a bid to threaten the winner but stayed on to best the rest. GYPSY LYNN got floated out a bit
early while showing speed, raced up closer four then three deep, chased the winner from the three path around the turn and held the show. AWESOME
TAYLOR lacked early speed outside a rival then three deep, went three wide into the turn then angled down to the inside, summoned a mild rally in the drive
and rounded out the superfecta. BALI DANCER showed early speed then lugged out in the early going, lost command at the nine-sixteenths pole, pressed
the winner to the turn, could not match strides and started to lose ground two wide on the turn and weakened in the drive. QUICKLIKEABUNNY broke out
and was quickly corrected, showed speed then got forced out by BALI DANCER early, chased between the leaders then dropped back out of range, went
two to three wide around the bend and could not rally. FRIED ASPARAGUS was off slow to begin, raced inside a pair of rivals at the back early, remained
far back two wide into the lane and failed to make an impact. ALPHIE'S ANGEL allowed to settle then gradually dropped back between rivals, trailed four
wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive. HEAD START tracked widest up the backstretch, five wide into the lane and weakened.

CHAOS THEORY pressed the pace from outside early, dueled around the turn, kept the pressure on into the final furlong, took a short lead in midstretch
and drew clear late. MAVEN set the pace under pressure from CHAOS THEORY on the outside, dueled on even terms around the bend then inched head
nearing the stretch, continued to battle then lost command midstretch and had to settle for second best. REAL MONEY sat off the pace outside a rival, took
the turn two to three wide, tipped out in the lane and got up for third. FULLY LOADED stalked three deep early then between rivals, angled to the rail around
the bend, chased through the lane and got edged for the show at the wire. MY HARBORS DREAM stalked four then three deep early, outside a rival in the
two path on the turn and failed to respond when called upon. KING OF SPEED chased between foes then got put in tight and checked nearing the
seven-sixteenths pole, rounded the bend two wide and could not rally. GRIT AND CURIOSITY broke a step slow, dropped back to last, saved ground
trailing the field, steered out in the lane and passed tired rivals. HE BE MOJO RISIN bumped JACKS OUTLAW at the start, settled on the inside, moved out
in the stretch and could not rally. JACKS OUTLAW bumped at the start, chased inside rivals then lost ground leaving the backstretch, was trying to get out
and fought the rider while inside a rival around the bend, moved out in the lane and weakened.

SPUN INTENDED vied for the lead inside rivals up the backstretch, cleared at the five-sixteenths pole, opened up under coaxing leaving the bend, widened
while given a tap of left handed urging midstretch and won in hand late. HARLOCAP was off slow on the outside, attended the pace five deep early, could
not keep up into the bend and angled from the four path down to the rail, kept to task through the lane and bested the rest. TALL BOY bobbled a bit at the
start, chased five wide into the turn, asked four wide around the bend and edged rivals for the show honors. TEXTHELEGEND showed early speed four
deep in the early going then began to climb near the half-mile pole, dropped back and chased three deep into the turn, stayed off the rail into the lane and
kept on while getting outkicked for the show. JOHANNES vied between rivals for command early, could not keep up with SPUN INTENDED at the
five-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into the stretch and flattened. VEGAS BURNER vied three deep in the early stages, chased the winner three wide
past three-eighths pole and weakened in the drive. BARNSTORMING was a bit rank in the early going, raced outside a rival then got put in a bit tight at the
three-eighths pole, exited the bend two wide and was not a factor. CALM SEA chased on the inside and never threatened. SMOOSE broke a step slow,
trailed four wide into the turn, angled down to the two path around the bend and never got involved.

Footnotes
HONG KONG HARRY (IRE) settled off the pace on the inside, roused around the far turn and tipped to the three path, drifted inward at the eight pole,
closed in outside the top pair and got up at the wire. BEYOND BRILLIANT was up close four deep leaving the chute then settled off the pace in the two
path, was on the move three wide on the far turn, reeled in the leader in the final sixteenth but was edged by the winner in the final moments.
MASTEROFFOXHOUNDS got bumped between rivals leaving the chute then went up to take command, moved clear on the clubhouse turn, set all the
pace to the stretch, remained clear into the final sixteenth and was run down in the final strides. SANTIN prominent early and bumped leaving the chute on
the inside, moved back to give chase along the rail, coaxed on the far turn and two wide into the stretch, earned a minor share but failed to threaten. IRIDEO
(ARG) unhurried in the beginning, bumped with inner rival nearing the stretch for the first time, steered to the inside, saved ground to the stretch, moved out
in the lane and lacked a rally. SET PIECE (GB) broke a step slow, angled to the inside while racing near the back and bumped entering the stretch for the
first time, went outside a rival on the clubhouse turn, pushed on through the final turn, came three wide into the lane and also failed to rally. SMOOTH LIKE
STRAIT away well in the beginning, got bumped while three deep on the front end exiting the chute, was closest in pursuit to the outside of
MASTEROFFOXHOUNDS through the early stages, pushed on through the far turn giving chase but lacked the needed response and weakened in the
lane. KENTUCKY GHOST broke a step slow on the outside, angled to the two path then inside and was never involved.

Footnotes
PERCOLATE (IRE) settled on the inside, moved forward in the middle stages, took aim two wide into the stretch, drew alongside the leader at the eight
pole, quickly took over and moved clear from that rival and held safely in the end. TIO MAGICO stalked three deep to the far turn, moved out and came five
wide into the stretch, closed well but was not enough to get to the winner. AGATINO (IRE) was a bit rank and steadied early on the inside, remained und a
hold in the middle stages, pushed on around the final turn but lacked room to advance, tipped out in the lane and put in a mild late bid while getting
outkicked for second. ALIGATO raced between rivals at the back early on, two wide outside a foe on the clubhouse turn, angled to the rail at the
three-sixteenths marker, steered back out in the lane and put in mild rally for a minor share. SEVEN WONDERS was off slow from outside, raced three
deep at the back entering the stretch first time around, moved into the two path , tipped three wide on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and showed a
mild response to improve placings. DOMINANT SOUL stumbled sharply but still came away quickly, sped clear and crossed over to the inside, remained
unchallenged to the stretch, collared by the winner at the eight pole, failed to offer any resistance and weakened in the final sixteenth. FLY THE SKY was off
slow to begin, pulled early at the back on the inside, saved ground to the stretch and failed to menace. HAWK OF WAR raced off the pace in the two path
then between rivals under a hold, shifted out at the three-eighths pole, exited the far turn four wide, got crowded between rivals in upper stretch and could
not rally. BANG FOR YOUR BUCK pulled early while up close from outside, stalked three wide around both turns and weakened in the drive. GOLDENEYE
was forwardly placed early while moving inside, started to pull then had to check off heels first time in the stretch, tipped to the two path to stalk the leader,
remained in range to the stretch then faded.
