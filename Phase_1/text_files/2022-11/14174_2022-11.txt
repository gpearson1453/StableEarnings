and was steadily handled in the lane. DRINKWITHTHESTARS pressured the pace from the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back toward the quarter,

outfinished in the stretch duel for second. NOCASHREFUNDS chased outside, rounded the turn about the four path then flattened through later yards.

LET US MAKE GOLD saved ground, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and improved at the rail on the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane and got up
the final yards in a well timed ride. FREEDOM RIDER stalked from the three path then took the lead into the backstretch, was urged clear from the three
eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and dug in under steady stretch handling, but was caught in the final yards. NIGHT BOSS settled just off the
pace in the two and three paths, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened the final furlong. DOLICE VITA
rated close inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, but lacked room at the five sixteenths, closed to the heels of rivals in the four path
midway on the far turn and showed little further. SASSY KING saved ground well off the pace, eased out into the backstretch and offered only a mild middle
move. SAGRADA RAY rounded the first turn about the five path then saved ground, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in
the four path then weakened. HAPPY YEARS settled off the rail, gave chase from the three eighths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn.
STRINGFELLA rated a slim lead inside, was met into the backstretch and gave chase from that point, but dropped back at the three eighths pole and
weakened into the far turn.
