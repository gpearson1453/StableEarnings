Footnotes
CONSPIRACY FACT broke a bit out and brushed a foe at the start, set the pace in the two path, inched clear of a trio of chasers approaching the three
furlong pole, then widened his margin under moderate urging through the lane. ONEMORANDTHECHECK stalked along the inside, chased the clearing
leader into the far turn, then gained place while shifting off of the rail nearing the lane, and proved second best. BIG HELLO tracked in the two path, tipped
to the four path turning for home before gaining show in upper stretch, and held it from an inner vying foe through the final furlong. SHAKEDOWN STREET
was brushed by an inner foe before bumping with an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace two wide and between horses early on, pursued from the
two path before moving up inside of foes entering the lane, vied for show coming to midstretch, but was fended off. PAID TWICE was brushed by an inner
foe while put to crowded quarters between horses at the start, saved ground towards the rear, and improved inside of rivals entering the lane. BIGGIE took
a staggers step before bumping with an inner foe while put to tight quarters at the start, rated at the rear two wide, took the far turn in the four path, and
move dup. LEAD ACTOR tracked in the three path, got floated to the five path around the far turn, and faded. CALIPARI laid far back along the inside, then
in the four path around the far turn, and moved up. AMERICAN SILVER lacked speed, and made little impact after tucking from three wide turning for home.
KING DOODLE pressed three wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with the leader entering the far turn, and weakened among foes turning for
home. B G LEE got hung four wide in midpack early on, but failed to sustain position entering the backstretch, and played no factor. DOUBLE DEALER
prompted the pace four wide, but yielded into the far turn, and weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
SOARING BIRD stalked the top pair from the two path around the turn, chased them without truly progressing in upper stretch, set up shop outside of those
bumping foes in midstretch, grinded away to produce a late bid inside the final sixteenth, and forged an advantage nearing the wire. BIG THORN prompted
the pace two wide, vied around the turn, dueled while creating a path of separation with his inner counterpart entering the lane, but took a bump from that
foe at the furlong grounds, continued to spar while receiving a more severe bump from that wandering rival soon after, then forged an advantage nearing the
final sixteenth, but was outkicked by an outer rival late. FULL IMPACT set the pace inside of a vying rival around the turn, maintained an advantage while
dueling through upper stretch, but shifted out from a left handed crop and bumped that rival entering the final furlong, lugged out and bumped that foe again
inside the furlong grounds, then flopped back to his left lead while lugging in and relinquishing the front, and faltered while continuing to wander about.
TURFY chased two wide, but yielded in the three path turning for home, and held fourth from an outer rival through the lane. STRIKE ME DOWN lacked
early speed, tucked from the five path to the two path entering the turn, improved while shifting out to the four path around the bend, but flattened out in
upper stretch, and was staved off for fourth. WITH VERVE saved ground towards the rear, but to no avail. BIG NICK tracked three wide and between
horses, but faded at the three furlong pole. AGGRESSIVITY pursued from midpack four wide, but faded in the five path around the turn.

CANAL tracked in the three path, searched for racing room from the two path behind the leading trio entering the lane, inched forward through a rail opening
and produced a bid inside of those foes in upper stretch, struck the front at the furlong pole, and edged clear while remaining on his left lead.
PERMAFROST stalked three wide and between horses, pressed around the turn, bid entering the lane, took a brush from the leader while forging an
advantage in upper stretch, shifted in and across that foe's path at the three sixteenths pole, but failed to match strides with a rail bidding rival entering the
final furlong, and was second best. CASHMEUP hesitated at the start and came out multiple lengths slow, tucked nearing the turn while off of the pace,
shifted out turning for home, and to the five path in upper stretch, then ran on to reach show entering the final sixteenth. FUNNY UNCLE pressed four wide,
ranged up entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with inner foes coming to the final furlong, bid for show leaving that station, but was outkicked by an
outer rival in the final sixteenth. BOXSTER prompted the pace two wide, led between horses around the turn, brushed an outer bidder entering the lane
while getting headed, then checked when put to tight quarters by between horses by that shifting rival, and gave way. REPREHEND broke multiple lengths
slow, lagged behind in the three to four paths turning for home, and moved up between horses. ICONICUS lacked speed in the five to four paths, then
floated to the six path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. WILDERZAR stalked in the two path, chased the leaders around the turn, then faded two wide in
upper stretch. SWISS GUARD set a pressured pace along the inside, but was headed with three furlongs to go, and wilted entering the lane.

Footnotes
FAMED laid off of the pace in the two to three paths, swung to the six path entering the lane, rallied on her left lead to take aim on the clearing leader in the
final furlong, ranged up entering the final sixteenth, and drove past. UNSOLVED MYSTERY was nudged by an inner rival into an outer foe leaving the
chute, moved forward to press the leader from the outside, vied while kept in the three path around the turn, led while shifting to the four path nearing the
lane, showed the way while shifting down on his game counterpart in upper stretch, drove clear of that faltering foe leaving the furlong grounds, but was
caught by an outer rival in the final sixteenth. HIDDEN CONNECTION bumped an outer rival while attempting to shift outside of the pace setter leaving the
chute, failed to sustain forward position soon after, tracked two wide and between horses, but was outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, and kept on
well to reach show in the late stages. LET'S BE CLEAR trailed in the three path, moved out to the seven path approaching midstretch, and moved up. DIVA
TREVA set the pace inside of a vying rival while remaining a path off of the inner rail, got headed at the five sixteenths foe, fought on through upper stretch,
but faltered while flopping back to her left lead at the furlong grounds. MORE THAN VOWS brushed the outer part of the gate, took a mild shoulder from an
inner rival leaving the chute, stalked three wide, but tired between horses in upper stretch. LADY BAFFLED chased along the inside, but faded.

Footnotes
MONTAUK POINT set the pace inside of a pair of vying rivals down the backstretch and around the far turn, shifted out while shaking clear of them in upper
stretch, held sway while flopping back to his left lead entering the final furlong, changed back over as rivals on both sides closed in inside the final sixteenth,
and narrowly lasted from the inner rival to the wire. ANDY CANT broke a tad outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, rated off of the pace in the two path,
awaited racing room turning for home, split foes two wide in upper stretch while launching a rally, then charged along the inside to bid inside of the leader in
the closing stages, but just missed. MAASAI WARRIOR broke a step slow while taking a bump from an inner foe at the start, raced at the rear in the two
path, shifted out and gained four to five wide turning for home, rallied to take aim on the clear leader entering the final furlong, but leveled off through the
late stages. NAPA VALLEY stalked three wide, pressed entering the backstretch, vied around the far turn, then from between horses entering the lane, but
was repelled in upper stretch, and yielded among foes entering the final furlong. PANCAKE HOUSE laid off of the pace three wide, inched closer into the far
turn to track the top trio from the outside, ranged up to bid entering the lane, but was turned away in upper stretch, then faded between horses at the furlong
grounds. LAYTOWN stalked two wide and between horses, pursued from the three path around the far turn, but lacked a bid. OLD POINT broke a beat
slowly while being bumped by an inner foe at the start, climbed into the first turn while achieving an inside tracking position, but faded through the lane.
ICEATUDE bumped an outer rival at the start, pressed two wide, then from between horses down the backstretch, vied around the far turn, but weakened
turning for home. TURTAR MARA backed out from between horses while off a step slowly, then was outrun, and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
LAVER bumped an outer rival at the start, stalked behind the pace setter before decisively bidding two wide approaching the five furlong pole, vied before
gaining an advantage into the turn, showed the way from a pair of outer bidders turning for home, shook clear of them in the three path in upper stretch, held
sway through midstretch, and lasted from an outer on-charging foe late. PRAIRIE DUNES laid off of the pace in the two path, tipped to the four path around
the turn, gained while fanning six wide entering the lane, then rallied outside of foes to take aim on the clear leader in the final sixteenth, quickly closed in
late, but ran out of ground. EMPEROR'S APPEAL broke slowly, rated far back in the three path, rallied between horses leaving upper stretch, gained show
from outer rivals entering the final sixteenth, and leveled off. BANISHING splayed his front feet leaving the gates, tracked six wide and outside of foes, then
four wide into the turn, bid three wide while still in the four path turning for home, but was turned away while floated back to the five path in upper stretch,
sustained his chase while getting outkicked for minor placings nearing the final sixteenth, and kept on. BASELINE BEATER was pinched between horses
soon after the start, trailed early on, improved in the four path around the turn before swinging to the eight path entering the lane, and stayed on after
shifting further out in midstretch. PERFORM stalked five wide, then three wide and between horses into the turn, bid outside of the leader turning for home,
but yielded after being floated to the four path in upper stretch. RUNGIUS pressed four wide and between horses, but tucked two wide after failing to keep
pace nearing the turn, chased around the bend, but lacked a bid among foes. DARIO raced in midpack three wide, inched closer to the top trio under a full
drive turning for home, but flattened out. READ ON was bumped and pushed inwardly by an outer foe at the start, set the pace along the inside, vied with
the eventual winner down the backstretch, but weakened approaching the three furlong pole. CHANCE was reluctant to load, then broke in and impacted
several rivals at the start, raced prominent three wide and between horses early on, but faded at the five furlong pole. MY IMAGINATION was herded in and
bumped a rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the two to three paths, and faded. KUPP bumped an inner rival before pinching an outer foe at the start,
chased from midpack along the inside, but weakened around the turn.

Footnotes
FARMINGTON ROAD saved ground far back rallied along the rail through upper stretch, tipped outside of the clear leader with multiple lengths to find in
midstretch, stayed on well to bid nearing the wire, and narrowly got up. RUN CLASSIC dueled for the lead inside of a rival through an arduous pace while
opening up on the rest of the field, drew clear in upper stretch, held way well into the final furlong, but met a host of bids late, and got nailed at the wire.
HAPPY AMERICAN rated at the rear two wide and between horses, trailed around the far turn, gradually shifted out while gaining through upper stretch,
brushed his way five wide at the furlong grounds, and stayed on between horses through the late stages after flopping back to his left lead, and narrowly
reached show. THE REDS laid off of the pace in the four to five paths, got brushed six wide by an inner rival in midstretch, and stayed on through the final
furlong. RUNNIN' RAY bumped an outer rival at the start, stalked the embattled leading pair from many lengths off, chased them from the three path around
the far turn, altered course inwardly to surpass a tiring rival at the three sixteenths pole while between horses, then chased among foes through the final
furlong, but missed show. KITTANSETT tracked along the inside before shifting to the three path around the first turn, chased from the four path around the
far turn, then failed to progress through upper stretch, and yielded between horses in the final sixteenth. ELEVEN CENTRAL dueled for the lead two wide
through a stern pace, but weakened in the three path in upper stretch. MAJOR FED took a nudge from an inner foe at the start, raced in midpack in the
three to four path around the first turn, and tired. SOUTHERN DISTRICT rated at the rear three wide, then took the far turn in the five path, and lacked a
rally. ETHICAL JUDGEMENT laid off of the pace in the two path, and yielded between horses turning for home.

COPPELIA pressed outside of the leader while taking the turn in the three path, gained an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, shifted out to the four path
entering the lane as an outer JOYFUL CADENCE menaced, kicked clear in upper stretch, and held sway. JOYFUL CADENCE stalked three wide, bid in the
four path turning for home, got floated to the five path while attempting to vie with the leader entering the lane, but was swiftly repelled in upper stretch, and
remained well clear of show. SCONSIN laid off of the pace three wide, inched closer in the five path while tracking the leaders around the turn, but failed to
sustain progress in upper stretch, and lacked a bid while holding show. CLUB CAR laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, tipped three wide
entering the lane, but failed to factor. SHARP HERO saved ground while tracking, but to no avail. PALM COTTAGE set the pace, showed the way inside of
the eventual winner into the turn, got headed at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
BANGO laid off of the pace along the inside, saved ground while tracking turning for home, inched closer to loom a danger behind the top pair in upper
stretch, smoothly tipped out three wide at the furlong grounds, sustained progress to bid at the sixteenth pole, and edged ahead late. SIBELIUS broke a bit
out at the start, vied two wide, forged a narrow advantage entering the lane, dueled with his inner game counterpart through midstretch, inched ahead as an
outer BANGO menaced entering the final sixteenth, and got outkicked late. TOP GUNNER set the pace inside of a stoutly pressing SIBELIUS, sparred with
that foe around the turn, fought on gamely through the lane after being narrowly headed at the quarter pole, but gave in a sixteenth from home. KAVOD
stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the top pair approaching the five sixteenths pole, but failed to bid in upper stretch, chased the dueling pair before
being outkicked and floated four wide by an inner foe in midstretch, and kept on. SURVEILLANCE broke a half a beat slow, trailed in the two path, improved
inside of wide foes entering the lane, chased behind rivals in upper stretch, paused briefly as BANGO shifted across his path nearing the furlong pole, and
lacked a bid in the late stages. MUCHO tracked three wide and between horses, pursued four wide turning for home, then failed to progress in upper stretch
before being floated five wide at the furlong grounds, and gave way. LONG RANGE TODDY chased two wide and between horses, but yielded among foes
at the three furlong pole. WILLISTON WAY raced in midpack four wide, but faded six wide entering the lane. TORONTOTORO lacked speed in the five
path, then faded while fanned seven wide entering the lane.
