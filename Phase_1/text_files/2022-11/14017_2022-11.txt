Footnotes
LUCY JANE set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer rival around the turn, shook free in upper stretch, and drew off under driving pressure. YOU'RE
AVOIDING ME prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, but failed to keep pace with her inner counterpart in upper stretch, then held place. TIME
FOR CUPID stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the top pair while inside of a rival with three furlongs to go, but failed to produce a bid turning for
home, then chased through the lane to prove best of the rest. SHRIMPIE laid off of the pace along the inside, hugged the fence while saving ground around
the bend, paused behind a rival turning for home before slipping through nearing the lane, then chased evenly. GIN N SIN stalked three wide, got floated
four wide at the three furlong pole, and faded through the lane. BODIEFUL saw her rider lose her irons at the start, but they were recovered within a
sixteenth of a mile, then raced off of the pace in the three path and failed to factor. TIAN'AI ROAD broke just over a length slow while last away, then
tracked from off of the pace in the two path, and tired. SUMMER AUTUMN ROSE showed little.

Footnotes
ALSANAH tracked along the inside, slipped inside of the leader to produce a rail bid in upper stretch, then kicked clear nearing the furlong grounds, flopped
back to his left lead entering the final sixteenth, but was kept to task thereafter. SHEZAPISTOL broke many paths outwardly at the start, set a clear pace in
the two path around the turn, but was outkicked by an inner rival approaching midstretch, and was second best. KLIMT'S MUSE stalked in the three path,
pursued the clear leader under mild urging around the turn, failed to bid before getting outkicked by an inner rival in upper stretch, then chased thereafter to
be best of the rest. GIRLS HOUSE chased in the two path, then yielded turning for home. CORTADO trailed in the two path and got outrun.

Footnotes
DIXIE FURY dueled for the lead inside of a rival around the turn, shook clear in upper stretch, and drew off under driving pressure. SHORTLY was bumped
by an outer rival into an inner foe at the start, stalked the dueling pair from the two to three path around the turn, and ran on to reach place entering the final
sixteenth. HENDRIX dueled for the lead outside of the eventual winner, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, and lost place at the sixteenth pole.
MIDNIGHT DREAMING took a bump from an outer foe at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside while under steady coaxing, and failed to menace. M
B'S MUNNING lunged in and bumped a foe at the start, then made little impact from the three path. SMALL SAILOR broke outwardly, chased in the three to
four paths, and faded. UTOPIAN TREASURE quickly failed to keep pace with the rest of the field after a sixteenth of a mild, and showed little.

GRAPNEL cleared, set an unchallenged pace around the turn, then drew off while gradually drifting out through the lane. HOLY CROSS chased along the
inside, was roused along into the turn to secure inside position, pursued the clear leader while gaining place around the turn, and held that position from an
inner foe through the late stages. DROP ANCHOR laid off of the pace two wide, then ran on to bid for place inside of a rival at the sixteenth pole, but was
fended off. BRONZE BEAST broke out, tracked in the four path, got floated to the six path entering the lane, and failed to factor. WE THANK YOU chased
the clear leader from the three path, but yielded while drifting to the five path entering the lane. JESUIT broke a step slowly before being floated out multiple
paths at the start, then was outrun in the four path. MALIBU TIME broke slowly, laid off of the pace along the inside, and faded.

Footnotes
LUCKSME hopped slightly at the start, set the pace inside of a vying rival while remaining a bit off of the inner rail, then drew off entering the lane, and
widened under moderate hand urging. SWEET SLEW took a bump from an inner foe at the start, chased outside of the top pair and from the four path
around the turn, gained place entering the lane while failing to keep pace with the clearing leader, and proved second best. SURE ENOUGH bumped an
outer rival at the start, tracked three wide, changed leads after shifting out to the five path in upper stretch, and chased mildly to reach show late. DOOIT laid
off of the pace in the three to four paths, and improved between horses in the final furlong. WILDCAT GIRL tracked two wide, tucked to the rail turning for
home, gained show from an outer rival at the three sixteenths pole, but was bested by a pair of foes late. XTRASAUCEWELLDONE raced far back in the
three path, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, and moved up. QUEEN OF CHILL broke slowly, lacked speed in the four to five paths, and failed to
factor. MIDNIGHT SOCIETY was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, vied two wide while in the three path, but yielded between horses
entering the lane, and weakened. RAG TOWN was outrun along the inside. LADY BRETT ASHLEY tracked along the inside, but weakened around the turn.

Footnotes
IPSUM GRATUS brushed the outer part of the gate while off a step slowly, laid off of the pace three wide, tracked in hand behind rivals around the turn, was
held up while aiming to a narrow seam between horses entering the lane, got through and split foes in upper stretch, rallied well to bid inside of the
wandering leader entering the final sixteenth, and drove clear. SHELL SHOCK prompted the pace three wide under steady urging, assumed command while
under a drive leaving the three furlong pole, opened up turning or home, but began to tire entering the final furlong, drifted out as an inner foe bid a sixteenth
from home, and was surpassed soon after. DIVINE HOPE trailed, circled rivals four to five wide around the turn to gain place entering the lane, grinded
away to take aim on the clear leader approaching midstretch, but flattened out while shifting ground outwardly in the final furlong. SHIP IT stalked along the
inside, but was shuffled back while trying to maneuver around a pair of faltering foes around the turn, did so among rivals turning for home, and chased
evenly through the lane. INEEDAGIRLLIKEYOU lacked speed along the inside, shifted three wide into the turn, and failed to factor. LOUELLA STREET
tracked two to three wide and between horses around the turn, but tired. BEACH KITTEN tracked four wide, but faded while getting outkicked nearing the
lane. JE SUIS RAPIDE vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but was headed into the turn, and weakened leaving the three furlong pole.
BALLYKEEN broke through the gate pre-race, but was re-loaded without further incident, dueled for the lead along the inside, but wilted approaching the
final three furlongs, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
COUNTY FINAL was hustled to secure position inside of rivals, dueled for the lead inside of a quartet of foes into the turn, got headed by a pair nearing the
lane, fought back to continue the battle in upper stretch, tenaciously sparred with an outer AIR COMBAT through the final furlong, and prevailed. AIR
COMBAT sparred for the lead four wide and between horses, vied only outside of a pair of rivals through upper stretch, then battled gallantly through the
final furlong as an inner foe sustained the long duel, and was denied at the wire. MY MAN FLINTSTONE dueled for the lead two wide and between horses,
battled among a pair of foes through upper stretch, but yielded to them coming to the final sixteenth. EDGE TO EDGE pressed five wide, but failed to keep
pace with the top trio entering the lane, and chased thereafter. TEMPT FATE vied for the lead three wide and among rivals, but gave way entering the lane.
FORE LEFT laid off of the embattled leaders along the inside, but failed to factor. FRANCATELLI tracked outside of the leaders while caught six wide
around the turn, and faded.

Footnotes
MR. WIRELESS tracked four to three wide into the turn, pursued under consistent coaxing around the bend, took aim on the newly leading HERE MI SONG
while being floated to the five path entering the lane, chased that foe through upper stretch, bid leaving the furlong grounds, dueled through the late stags,
forged an advantage late, and prevailed. HERE MI SONG stalked outside of the clear leader while inside of another chasing foe down the backstretch, bid
two wide at the three furlong pole, gained an advantage turning for home, shifted out to the four path entering the lane as an outer MR WIRELESS
menaced, shook free and shifted inwardly in upper stretch, but met that foe's bid inside the final furlong, sparred gallantly while getting headed in the late
stages, and missed re-reaching even terms via a head bob at the wire. SOUTH BEND failed to keep pace down the backstretch, picked up stride in the four
path turning for home before fanning to the six path entering the lane, grinded away in pursuit of the dueling pair through the final furlong, produced a late
bid, but just came up show. CHESS CHIEF chased in the three path under strong urging, tucked behind the leading pair around the turn, then cut the corner
entering the lane, but lacked a rail rally. FIVE STAR GENERAL cleared off early on, met a bid from an outer foe into the turn, got headed while remaining a
bit off of the rail leaving the five sixteenths pole, and faded between horses in upper stretch. MYSTIC NIGHT was outrun throughout.

Footnotes
TEN GAUGE pressed two wide, bid at the three furlong pole, led entering the lane, cleared in upper stretch, lugged inwardly and across his inner
counterpart's path in midstretch, and held sway safely thereafter. PUSH BUTTON set the pace inside of a pressing rival, got headed by that foe nearing the
lane, altered course outside of that lugging rival in the final furlong in hopes of rebidding, but was fended off. QAADER tracked three to four wide, and
stayed on. NASHOBA'S JOY stalked two to three wide, but only managed to chase through the lane. VINTAGE YEAR stalked along the inside, but failed to
progress before fading. GOOD SOLDIER broke a step slowly and failed to factor. INBOUND hopped slightly while off a beat slow, and made little impact.
HABITUS never got involved. LOLAS BEAU was outrun.
