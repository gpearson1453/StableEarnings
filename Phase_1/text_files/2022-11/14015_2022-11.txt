Footnotes
GIANT'S FIRE bumped with a rival at the start, settled on the inside of that foe, moved closer near the nine-sixteenths, went around the turn in the four path,
was asked just inside the five-sixteenths, jostled with HAPPY BOB while keeping that foe behind horses in upper stretch, rallied to make a bid outside the
sixteenth-pole and got up under steady handling to prevail. OPPORTUNITY SET disputed the pace on the inside of two foes, vied along the rail on the turn,
dueled with MATT DOYLE into the final sixteenth, fought with that foe and the winner to the wire then was denied while just able to get the place. MATT
DOYLE was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the outside of two opponents, vied in the three path under urging on the turn, dueled with the
runner-up while remaining on his inside lead in the stretch, battled between the top two in the final sixteenth and just missed while clear for the show.
HAPPY BOB came in some while hustled from the gate, settled off the pace, moved closer at the nine-sixteenths then was taken in hand while behind
horses, went two then three wide on the turn, was asked while inside of a foe at the three-eighths, jostled with GIANT'S FIRE while trying to get out in upper
stretch, lacked room in while pocketed behind foes into the final furlong then altered to the outside and missed the trifecta. MAGICAL WAYS was hustled
from the start, contested the pace between foes, vied in the two path while asked for more around the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired.
TIGER TOWN BOY bumped with a rival at the start, was ridden along on the outside, went four to five wide for most of the turn, dropped to the three path
late on that bend and failed to respond.

Footnotes
BERT BERT BERT was a bit restless in the gate then came away towards the rear of the field, moved up to track the pace on the outside, chased in the four
path around the turn, gained to take the lead at the quarter-pole then kicked clear in upper stretch, drifted in while drawing away under a strong hand-ride
into the final furlong, continued under a solid-hand ride into the final seventy yards then was eased up while much the best. CENTRAL PRIDE bumped with
a rival at the start, moved out early then settled off the pace, shifted further out near the three-quarter pole, was urged along passing the five-eighths, raced
in the four path around the turn, came six wide into the stretch and improved position to safely secure the place. CICCIOBELLO broke in at the start, went to
the early lead, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, was asked in the two path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened while able to
get the show. STEERAGE bumped with a rival at the start, switched to the outside early then moved up to contest the pace, was asked in the three path on
the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. MIDNIGHT EXPRESS was restless in the gate, came away in good order, was well placed just off the
pace, chased two then three wide on the turn, moved a bit further out outside the quarter-pole, swung five wide into the stretch and came up empty.
REUNION TOUR was bumped on both sides at the start then squeezed back between horses, raced on the outside under urging, went five wide on the
turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. SALTY HEIR stumbled at the start then was taken up some in tight quarters, spotted the front a
few lengths, settled at the rear, was urged along while inside to the two path around the turn and failed to threaten.

engaged those foes in the four path around the turn, took the advantage outside the quarter-pole, shook clear into upper stretch, drew away while kept to
the task into the final seventy yards then was eased up while much the best. ASSERTIVE ATTITUDE was hustled from the gate then taken in hand early,
set the pace under pressure from his outside, vied in the two path while inside of two opponents around the turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole and
