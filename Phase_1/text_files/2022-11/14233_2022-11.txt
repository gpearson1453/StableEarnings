Footnotes
WILDWOOD'S WARRIOR broke quickly inside, set the early pace while prompted by MICHAEL GEORGE to his outside, tracked the pace after that one
took the lead past the seven eighths, headed that foe from his inside at the nine sixteenths, led inside into the far turn, was engaged from the outside by I'M
YOUR VALENTINE past the three eighths and vied inside that one, reasserted a lead into the lane, went to a drive past the three sixteenths, drifted out, and
kept on under mainly a hand ride except for one corrective strike late. I'M YOUR VALENTINE settled toward the rear, took closer order approaching the half,
bid two wide around the far turn, engaged outside of WILDWOOD'S WARRIOR past the three eighths and vied two wide, was no match for that foe in upper
stretch and chased on second best. BON DEUX tracked the leading pair, took closer order approaching the half, hugged the rail around the far turn,
steadied behind a fading foe near the three eighths, continued to chase the leading pair down the lane and proved best of the rest. MODIFIER was restless
in the post parade and behind the gate, broke slowly and came awkwardly in to stride, took closer order three to four wide around the far turn, was driven
two wide into the lane, and improved mildly between horses. MONSTERONTHEMIDWAY chased midfield, took closer order on the leading pair inside of
BON DEUX approaching the half mile mark, settled back and switched out past the half, was pushed along three wide, was bumped past the three eighths
by the fading MICHAEL GEORGE, and flattened four wide in the lane. NAGY AND DA BEARS settled well behind the main group, saved ground around the
far turn, was driven inside in upper stretch and faded. MICHAEL GEORGE was sent for pace outside, prompted outside of WILDWOOD'S WARRIOR into
the first turn, led past the seven eighths, was reengaged by WILDWOOD'S WARRIOR to his inside and headed by that foe near the nine sixteenths,
weakened between horses around the far turn and had no more in the lane.

Footnotes
GHAALEB'S MAGIC joined the pace four wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival into upper stretch, responded to wrest the advantage
nearing midstretch, shifted inwards once clear and held sway to the end under right handed pressure. TIME BREAK tracked off the second flight along the
rail in the opening stages, was eased back from that position nearing the turn, shifted out approaching upper stretch to steadily gain position three wide
between foes and continued with interest in that path to prove best of the others. LA GUERRERITA was rated off the first flight between foes racing to the
turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share nearing the wire. KIANA'S LOVE was urged three deep
between foes in the opening stages between dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, set the pace off the inside racing into the turn, dueled into upper
stretch, then faded leaving midstretch when failing to match the winner. SUMMER LOVIN broke slowly, was settled last racing into the turn, shifted to the
four path in the stretch but offered no rally while finishing in hand. NOCTURNAL MISSION was settled off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn
and offered no rally. ASHLEY ELIZABETH was urged along the inside prompting the leaders racing into the turn and gave way after a half.

Footnotes
FREE LOVE was quick to the lead, raced keenly down the backstretch while still on a clear lead, saved ground around the far turn, went to a drive
midstretch and maintained a clear lead to the finish. PERFECTLY PROUD tracked the leading pair, got through inside of CRYSTAL SNOW into the far turn,
tracked the pacesetter in the two path around the second turn, could not reel in FREE LOVE down the lane but kept on willingly to finish well clear of the
others. CRYSTAL SNOW tracked the pacesetter early, was relegated to third position into the far turn when PERFECTLY PROUD rallied inside her, tracked
the leading pair in the three path around the far turn, was no match for the leading pair into the lane but chased on to prove best of the rest under a two to
three wide drive in the lane. D'ORO FOREVER broke inward, chased three wide, was pushed along in the three path around the far turn, swung four wide
into the lane, and chased on mildly while drifting out late. MISS KITTY PIE chased inside, offered a mild bid inside in upper stretch, and flattened late.
MIZZEN MILLIONS tracked two wide around the first turn, advanced to track the leading pair outside of PERFECTLY PROUD down the back straight,
flattened to midfield into the far turn, raced between horses around that bend, was driven in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. COWGIRL FRANKIE
broke a step slowly, raced keenly inside early, continued well off the pace down the back straight, was pushed along inside around the far turn, swung out
four to five wide into upper stretch, and lacked the needed rally. PRADA'S MIRACLE settled near the rear, was pushed along in the two path on the far turn,
and did not muster a rally. BEE A WINNER stumbled out of the gate and was cut off at the start by D'ORO FOREVER breaking inward, trailed well off the
inside, raced in the four to five path on the far turn and made no bid. TANGO CITY chased two wide between horses, weakened in the three to four path on
the far turn and continued to fade in the lane.

Footnotes
SCAT SHACK, off slowly, settled along the inside racing to the backstretch, advanced along the rail to challenge inside the pacesetter nearing upper stretch,
exchanged brushes with that rival racing through the stretch while tipping a bit off the inside, gained a narrow advantage in the closing stages and just held
LOOK AWAY under firm encouragement. The latter broke readily, shifted inwards exchanging light contact with FLASHY RICHIE tracking off the pacesetter
to the first turn, was eased back from that position while switching well off the inside racing into backstretch, gradually gathered momentum leaving the far
turn, swung five wide in upper stretch and produced his best stride in the closing stages to close the gap while prevailing for the place honors. FLASHY
RICHIE was prompted to a position in second flight while exchanging light contact racing into the first turn, tipped off the inside steadily advancing on the
pacesetter in tandem with several rival racing into the far turn, lost some position nearing upper stretch, shifted to the rail entering the lane, was roused to
advance inside foes, then steadied momentarily in close quarters midstretch, but continued with interest inside foes to narrowly prevail for a share.
SUPRISE CAT broke sharply, sprinted clear of the field along the inside to the backstretch, held sway on a clear margin to the far turn, set the pace a bit off
the rail through the second bend, briefly resisted the winner's challenge while leaning inwards brushing that foe racing through upper stretch but yielded to
the top trio late while finishing in hand in the final strides. RAVE ON stumbled at the start, settled outside a rival racing to the first turn, continued four wide
into the far turn to briefly gain striking position nearing upper stretch but had no closing response while his rider let his mount finish on his own courage.

Footnotes
FRISCO LINE tracked just behind the leader three wide early, was taken back near the five eighths and advanced again nearing the turn when clear,
engaged outside of KANITHAPPEN into the turn, dueled two wide from the three eighths into upper stretch, went to a drive in upper stretch, cleared past the
furlong mark and drifted in late. KANITHAPPEN broke outward, raced a bit keenly on a narrow lead early, was pushed along into the far turn, dueled inside
of FRISCO LINE from the three eighths into upper stretch, proved no match for that foe past the furlong mark but chased on well clear for the place.
CLASSOFSIXTYSEVEN trailed early, took closer order in the three path on the turn, regained touch with the pack into the lane, improved under a drive
between horses, proved no threat to the top two but got up late for the show. TAPIT SAM attended the early pace inside, was pushed along in the three to
four path on the turn to track the leading pair, came four wide into the lane, drifted out a bit further in upper stretch, proved no match for the top two, chased
on but lost the show late. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE attended the early pace between horses, settled back approaching the turn, chased the leading trio while
saving ground around the bend, was pushed along past the three eighths and driven inside in upper stretch, and flattened. DYNAMOMETER broke inwardly
and a bit awkwardly, settled near the rear of the main group inside of NACHO S early, was driven while chasing in the five path on the turn, drifted out in the
lane and flattened. NACHO S settled at the rear of the main group outside of DYNAMOMETER, weakened in the four path on the turn, went to a drive past
the five sixteenths, and had no response.

Footnotes
FIRST KITTEN was urged to terms with the pacesetter in the three path early forcing the issue outside that foe into the turn, took over nearing upper
stretch,, went clear through the lane and was kept to firm encouragement. ALMAFUERTE ducked out at the start bumping HELL OF THE NORTH, was
righted to track the leaders inside foes racing into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch, tipped off the inside late and proved best of the others. FIRST
SQUADRON was urged disputing the pace from the outset along the inside into the turn, drifted out once headed racing into upper stretch but kept on well
enough for a share. CAIRO SUMMER tracked the leaders four wide in second flight in early stages, continued three deep into the lane and finished evenly
between rivals late. MINI DRESS, cut off by FIVE ROSES LUNA at the start steadying off that rival, settled last to the turn, then made some belated
progress inside foes in the closing stages. AIKEN TO BE TAKIN settled off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn, shifted out five wide in upper
stretch but made no impact. HELL OF THE NORTH, bumped at the start while off slowly, tracked off the second flight along the inside to the lane but came
up empty in the drive. FIVE ROSES LUNA ducked out at the start crossing a rival's path, was righted to make brief pursuit of the leaders between foes but
steadily faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
WALKER'S WIN tracked between horses early, tracked the leader in the two to three path on the turn, was driven for a three wide bid into upper stretch,
vied through midstretch, came in on TIGHTROPE near the furlong mark, vied outside TETSU to the sixteenth pole and edged away late. TETSU was
fractious in the gate, tracked inside early, was pushed along while tracking the leading pair on the rail around the turn, bid inside into the lane, led inside of
TIGHTROPE near the three sixteenths, vied through midstretch, proved no match for WALKER'S WIN in the final sixteenth but held on inside for place. W
W CANDY raced at the inside of the rear flight early, continued near the rear in the three path on the turn, bid inside into the lane, shifted out nearing
midstretch, rallied late between horses and missed the place. HUEY ATTACK tracked three wide early, continued to track the leading pair between foes on
the turn, came two wide into the lane in range behind the leading flight, angled out and was driven four wide midstretch, kept on between horses but was
outkicked for the place. BRING ME A CHECK chased midfield early, improved position approaching the turn to track three wide, swung out toward the
center of the track into upper stretch, drifted in approaching midstretch, kept on on willingly under a drive five wide but was narrowly outfinished. W W
CRAZY raced between horses in the rear flight early, continued near the rear in the four path on the turn, angled out near the center of the track into upper
stretch, and chased on evenly to the finish. TIGHTROPE was put on the lead and soon cleared, set the pace in the two path on the turn, was engaged from
both sides in upper stretch and headed by TETSU to his inside near the three sixteenths, steadied between horses at the furlong mark when WALKER'S
WIN came in, began to flatten and emptied out in the final sixteenth. JEFF THE LION settled four wide in the rear flight, trailed in the four to five path on the
turn, was driven in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally.

Footnotes
KEEPMEINTHE MOMENT, in touch with the first flight three wide between foes in the opening stages, conceded some position to the leaders to attend the
pace in that path into the turn, pressed the issue into upper stretch, edged forward midstretch and maintained a narrow advantage to the end under firm
right handed pressure. MAUREENLOVESFRANK was urged to terms with the first flight five wide in the opening stages, continued four deep into the turn
pursuing the leaders in that path into upper stretch and edged rivals for the place honors late while failing to match the winner. AVASARALA was urged
inside foes from the outset disputing the pace into the turn, dueled inside foes past ,midstretch but was outkicked by the top pair. IGGY BIGS, off a step
slowly, was collected, then prompted to advance inside foes racing into the turn, shifted out five wide in upper stretch and continued willingly to close the
gap. JOURNEYIST was urged four wide between foes to race on terms with the first flight in the opening stages, was eased off the pace racing in that path
into the turn and offered no rally. MARYS LAST SONG switched out six wide dropping off the leaders racing through the backstretch and failed to mount a
serious challenge. CHROME ATTACK angled inwards to track off the first flight between foes racing into the turn and faded into upper stretch. JUDY'S MS.
OFFICER was urged between foes from the outset disputing the pace into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. RARE ACTION ATTACK was outpaced
early and trailed throughout.
