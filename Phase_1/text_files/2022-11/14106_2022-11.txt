Footnotes
PLEASE FOCUS vied for the lead from inside then cleared around the clubhouse turn, controlled the pace in hand to the far turn, showed the way while
saving ground to the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safely under urging. LUKA GRAZIE unhurried in the beginning at the back then became
rank into the first turn, steadied when running up behind a rival into the backstretch, went between foes leaving the backstretch, angled out four wide on the
far turn then came three wide into the stretch, finished determinedly through the lane and closed the gap on the winner while earning the place.
MONTEPULCIANO had early speed then started to pull the rider along when trying to rate, continued to fight around the first turn, stalked inside into the
second bend, saved ground then tipped out in the lane and lacked a late bid while saving third. HERECOMEGEORGIEBOY steadied between early, raced
outside a rival at the back into the first turn, trailed into the backstretch, tipped three wide on the far turn and missed the show. CATHEDRAL LIGHT broke a
step slow, lost his path early then began to pull and bumped between rivals into the first turn, tracked two wide then moved closer into the second bend,
raced three deep at the five-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into the lane and lacked a rally. CLOUSEAU broke a step slow then was hustled early and
started to pull and became rank on the inside, ran up on heels and steadied, chased on the inside through the far turn and could not rally. RECKLESS
AFFAIR bumped and pulled and steadied three deep on the first turn, trailed two wide into the stretch and weakened. DRUIDIC steadied off heels early then
began to pull hard while three deep, was closest in pursuit to the far turn, dropped back between rivals around that bend and tired in the lane.

KRAHENBUHL bumped with BLETCHLEY PARK then chased the early leader near the inside then moved out and went between rivals, bid three deep at
the half-mile pole, gained command at the five-sixteenths pole, cleared with a quarter mile left to run, powered away under some left handed urging and
steady handling then coasted in nearing the wire. PURIFIED was off awkwardly and came away last, steered out and chased widest at the back to the turn,
navigated the bend five then four wide and bested the rest. BLETCHLEY PARK bumped leaving the gate, lost his path when THALES crossed over at the
five-eighths pole, bid between rivals at the half-mile pole, fought between rivals then dropped out of contention nearing the quarter pole, churned on through
the lane and earned the show honors. WARRIOR ROAD lugged in shortly after the start, chased three deep then four wide into the first turn, exited the bend
three wide and failed to rally. THALES sped to the front from outside, cleared and crossed over, vied with rivals into and around the turn, could not keep up
with the winner at the quarter pole and gave way in the stretch.

over the runner-up. SMILING MOLLY angled to the inside towards the rear, inched closer while saving ground around the bend, steered out in the lane and
drew alongside the top pair in the final sixteenth but could not get by. VASCO vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals, disposed of those challengers at the
quarter pole, led into the final furlong then was engaged by DORIS MAE midstretch, lost command at the sixteenth pole and flattened to third. QUEEN

and kept on for a minor award. D'S LOVELY SOPHIA was off slow to begin, trailed two wide into the turn, tipped to the three path then swung out leaving
the bend and could not rally. VA VA VOOM stalked two wide into the turn, moved to the three path then found traffic behind a rival briefly at the quarter pole,
got crowded between rivals in upper stretch and weakened. HER PERFECT VISION went up to vie three deep for command, fought around the turn then

Footnotes
CHARLOTTE HARBOR raced up close outside the top trio, challenged four deep around the turn, took over past the five-sixteenths pole, cleared late on the
bend, drew off under right handed urging and strong handling and was in hand nearing the wire. SWEET HEIDELBERG bumped leaving the gate, pressed
the top pair early from outside, took over at the five-sixteenths pole but was quickly overtaken by CHARLOTTE HARBOR, chased that rival into the lane,
drifted out and bested the rest. BIG SHAMROCK broke out and bumped rival, took back to avoid a shuffle early, went two wide into the turn, steered out and
came four wide into the stretch and gained the show. SPANISH CHANNEL chased early then went up to take control between rivals, dueled up the
backstretch, fought between rivals on the turn, could not match strides with the top pair past the quarter pole and flattened to fourth. LUCY L stalked widest
early on, rounded the bend four then five wide and weakened. DRIZELLA chased on the inside, tugged briefly then went up to duel for command from
inside, vied with outside trio on the turn then checked past the five-sixteenths pole and faded out of contention.

Footnotes
PLEASANT WAVE forwardly placed in the early going, applied pressure from outside into the turn, lost touch around the bend, chased two wide into the
lane, re-engaged the leader midstretch and dug in late to best CHRISTINA'S CANDY late stages. CHRISTINA'S CANDY sped to the front and crossed over,
met the bid from PLEASANT WAVE into the turn, moved clear again around the bend, challenged again by that rival outside the sixteenth pole and was
overtaken late. PLAYLIST was hard to load prior to the start, stalked from inside, tipped out in the lane but lacked room between the top pair, altered out
with a sixteenth to go and finished willingly to the wire. ANYBODY'S CHOICE was off slow in the beginning, tracked two then three wide on the turn and
lacked a late bid. RYLAN JAYNE chased along the rail, lost her path at the seven-sixteenths pole and dropped back, saved ground to the stretch and could
not rally. MAGAZINE broke slow, trailed two wide into the turn, exited the bend three wide and failed to menace. DADS WISH was off a bit slow then went to
race up close from outside, drifted to the four path on the turn and lost ground, stayed wide to the lane and came up empty.

MY MAN BAGS was closest in pursuit well off the rail leaving the backstretch, dove down to the inside early on the turn, bid inside LOVE MY JIMMY past
the eighth pole and drove clear. LOVE MY JIMMY sped clear and set the pace up the backstretch, led four wide into the turn then moved down to the two
path, led clear into the final furlong, was challenged from inside while drifting out and yielded to the winner. OIL CAN KNIGHT broke a step slow and
bumped with TOBACCO ROAD at the start, tracked outside a rival early, three then four wide on the turn and gained the show. TOBACCO ROAD was off a
bit slow and bumped at the start, chased outside a rival towards the rear, came three wide into the lane and improved position. PERFECTO AMOR traveled
in mid-pack while wide in the early going, entered the turn six wide, moved down to the four path racing outside rivals midway around the bend, came five
wide into the stretch and failed to menace. DEVOTED TO YOU chased along the inside near the back and failed to make an impact. PURE SPEIGHT was
fractious in the gate, tracked two wide off the pace through the turn and came up empty. SHARP WARNING lagged behind early, trailed wide early on then
angled in on the turn and was always outrun.

MYFAVORITEDAUGHTER was a bit antsy in the gate, had to check back early, settled two wide then moved inside, lacked room and steadied off heels at
the quarter pole, stayed inside then tipped out and rallied between rivals and drove clear. ONE SILK STOCKING got put in tight by the leader and checked
along the rail early, gained a good stalking position from the rail, roused at the quarter pole, tipped out in upper stretch and put to left and right handed
urging, fought three deep into the final sixteenth and got outkicked by the winner. FLAME MCGOON stepped to the front and was keen early under a hold,
set the pace under pressure to the far turn, vied with rivals then cleared at the quarter pole, showed. JIBBER JABBER (IRE) brushed leaving the gate,
stalked between foes or outside a rival, angled out on the far turn and came four wide into the drive and lacked a late bid. DOLLY MAY (IRE) raced up close
outside the top pair, bid three deep on the far turn but failed to sustain the challenge nearing the quarter pole and flattened in the final furlong. FAIRY TALE
BLISS had to steady off heels early, stalked three deep or three wide around both turns, moved out in the lane and failed to menace. TARANTA (IRE)
checked on the inside early then again into the first turn, trailed to the far turn, went between on the second bend then angled out in upper stretch and could
not rally. TEEN DRAMA bumped leaving the gate, pressed the pace from outside, failed to keep up with a quarter mile left to run and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
COURTSIDE broke a step slow on the inside, rated through the early stages stalking the pacesetter, tipped out and given his cue with a quarter mile left to
run, collared the leader exiting the turn, quickly took over and disposed of PRINCIP at the top of the lane, then widened under a tap of right handed
encouragement and won in hand late. PRINCIP sped to the front and moved inside, showed the way up the backstretch, pressured from outside at the
seven-sixteenths pole, moved clear at the five-sixteenths marker, was challenged by COURTSIDE exiting the far turn, relinquished the lead shortly after and
stayed on to secure the place. MIGRATION bumped with PALAGIO at the start, was fanned seven wide into the first turn then dropped back and steered
down to the two path around the bend, raced along the inside then two wide on the far turn, angled out into the stretch and was along for the show.
PALAGIO bumped then got crowded between leaving the gate, chased six deep into the first turn then angled to the three path, continued off the rail and
chased three to four wide under asking on the second bend, flattened in the lane but kept on for a minor award. GREENBOW raced up close outside the
leader three then two wide early, applied pressure leaving the backstretch, lost touch at the five-sixteenths pole, chased three wide into the lane and faded.
WESTERN CAPE chased five then four wide around the first turn, dropped back and angled from the three path to the rail on the far turn and had little left
for the stretch run. LOTTERY PICK forward four wide into the first turn then moved into the three path, dropped back around the second bend while three
then two wide and tired.
