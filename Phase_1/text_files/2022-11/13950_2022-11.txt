Footnotes
GET OFF MY CLOUD took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, was briefly met leaving the half mile pole, promptly recovered the advantage and pulled
clear of Ydouhavetobesomean past the five sixteenths pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and was kept alert through the lane. DON'TCALLTOOEARLY
settled off the pace in the three path, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, though, had to settle for second best.
COMEONTURNMELOOSE saved ground off the pace, eased out into the backstretch and started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail
on the far turn and came along for third later yards. YDOUHAVETOBESOMEAN stalked off the rail, closed to a brief lead past the half mile pole, was quickly
overcome and gave chase, raced off the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. ROCKET BALLAD saved ground off the pace, bid from the three
eighths pole then weakened off the rail on the far turn. HARDIN was never a factor.

Footnotes
LADY KAZA took the lead nearing the quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure at the three eighths pole, raced at the rail
on the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. TAKE ME HOME raced inside through the front stretch then angled out into the first turn and
stalked the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close in the three path of the far turn and ran evenly down the lane. SAX rounded the first turn
in the four path, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride.
THEA'S THEME was shut off and steadied off the heels of Take Me Home into the first turn then saved ground, bid toward the quarter pole, raced at the rail
on the far turn then weakened. MORTAL STORM raced off the rail the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. DUSTWHIRL WONDER
dropped well out of contention. The Stewards reviewed then dismissed a claim of foul against the rider of Take Me Home for interference into the first turn,
lodged by the rider of Thea's Theme.

challenge of Why Lea leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths, drew clear at the rail approaching the quarter
pole and was kept alert in the stretch. MANGORITA settled inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and finished well, but
had to settle for second best. SHESAHUMBLEHUSTLER saved ground on the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then dueled through the stretch for third. WHY LEA stalked then challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole
and gave close chase through the backstretch, but dropped back nearing the quarter pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and weakened in the
stretch duel for third. CHOSEN MISS settled off the rail on the opening turn and could only improve her position. BUNNY PRINCESS raced off the pace in
the three path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. BRINGTHEWINE was bumped and steadied at the start then rounded the

COLT ROCK took over inside nearing the seven sixteenths pole and rated the pace, raced near the rail on the turn and dug in under steady handling to hold
on well. WINDSOR'S STAR chased through the backstretch, eased outward on the turn and entered the stretch about the five path, then dug in through the
final furlong to take the nod for second under the wire. TWO ROOM SCHOOL chased and raced off the rail on the turn, dug in under steady stretch handling
but was nipped from second under the wire. DE'S CASTLE gave chase, raced in the three path of the turn and ran evenly in the stretch. MISSIONARY
chased through the backstretch and raced in range near the rail on the turn, then flattened the final sixteenth. SUMMONING DENIS gave early chase
outside then saved some ground on the turn. EL LUCERITO became very fractious in the gate and was a late scratch. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
NAVY SWORD saved ground well off the early pace, closed the gap from the half mile pole then bid nearing the three eighths, contested at a close
disadvantage off the rail on the far turn, took the nod past the eighth pole and dug in under determined handling to keep the edge. SENECA ROCKS settled
off the rail early then eased out into the backstretch, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced close three wide on the far turn, dug in leaving
the turn to take second mid-stretch and finished well while gaining on the winner. SOMEDAY IS TODAY drew clear and angled to the inside to rate the
pace, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, but was met leaving the eighth pole and
relented the final sixteenth. AZZURRA exchanged contact with The Sky Is Falling leaving the gate then raced well back off the rail on the first turn, eased
out leaving the second turn and bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, eased to the outside in the upper stretch and
ran evenly from there. YOLO CHARLOTTE rated close to the early pace inside, gave chase leaving the half mile pole then faded on the far turn. THE SKY
IS FALLING exchanged contact with Azzurra leaving the gate and settled in the three path early, eased out into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole but showed little resolve and flattened in the three path of the far turn. TIZBIT settled off the pace about the four path the first turn, saved
ground into the second turn then faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
ANGELA'S ROMEO raced well back saving early ground, bid leaving the half mile pole and steadily improved from that point, raced in the four path of the
far turn and dug in under steady stretch handling to get up the final strides. WITH SECRET ENERGY rated close inside, started a bid leaving the three
eighths pole and raced three wide on the far turn, took aim into the lane and dug in for a brief lead mid-stretch, but was caught in the final strides.
JAXJAXXORJACKS took the lead into the first turn and rated a slim lead, dug in to the challenge of Well Equipped leaving the half mile pole and put that
one away toward the quarter, contested the edge at the rail through the far turn but was met approaching mid-stretch and weakened the final sixteenth.
BLUE N GOLD settled back in the three path, picked up the chase from the half mile pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, angled to the five path into the
lane and passed a rival. MY BOY CLYDE saved ground well off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and
passed rivals in the lane. WELL EQUIPPED rounded the first turn in the five path then stalked from the seven eighths pole, challenged into the backstretch
but dropped back at the quarter pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and weakened into the lane. STRONG LIL KOKORO rounded the first turn in the four
path then stalked, eased out into the backstretch and picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, but weakened in the five path of the far turn.
SPECTACULO rated close to the early pace inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail into the far turn.
