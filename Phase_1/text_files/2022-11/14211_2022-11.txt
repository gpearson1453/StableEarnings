Footnotes
SEAU went to a clear lead to set all the pace was challenged in the final sixteenth, battled to the wire and just lasted. KNIGHT COMMANDER tracked the
leaders from the two path through the final turn then engaged the leader in deep stretch but just missed. PAYDAY TOO stalked the pace from the four path
to the final turn then made a mild bid but was no match for the top two. MINNESOTA MIRACLE raced in the middle of the pack from the three path made a
middle move but was not enough. DOCTOR LEO was forwardly placed in the early stages made a mild bid going into the final turn and faded.
DREWPOWER was allowed to settle around the first turn then made a mild bid on the backstretch and finished evenly. WISH UPON A STAR was not a
factor. CITIZEN WEST was within striking distance on the first turn then retreated.

Footnotes
TRINITY HOPE was allowed to settle in the early stages then moved four wide to circle the field and took a clear lead in upper stretch to prove best. HERE
COMES LOVIE tracked the leaders from the two path to the final turn then move out four wide on the final turn but couldn't catch the winner. ANN'S STORM
was close up while racing four wide, took the lead at the half pole briefly, and tired. STAR FASHION raced near the back around the first turn and down the
backstretch, slipped through going into the final turn and faltered. LOVERS NEVER SAY went to a clear early lead around the first turn then vied for the lead
down the backstretch and weakened. ST MARIA pressed the pace from the three path and dropped back on the backstretch. COME WHAT MAE raced in
the middle of the pack to the first turn then made a rail bid to take a brief lead and gave way.

five wide in upper stretch to be up for the show. BIG BOSS MAN vied for the lead from the two path through the final turn, floated out slightly coming out of
the turn and tired. CLERIC tracked the leaders from the inside and flattened out. PAT ME DOWN raced near the back and finished evenly. HEATHER'S
REQUEST was in the middle of the pack from four wide and failed to menace. SIXTO was allowed to settle to the final turn but was never a factor.
HELIOCHROME saved ground to no avail. WYMAN went five wide into the first turn then stalked the pace from the three path but was through early.
