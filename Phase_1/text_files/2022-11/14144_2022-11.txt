Footnotes
THE LAST FACT chased inside of WILDCAT HAGRID early, began a bid inside past the seven sixteenths, engaged inside of the pacesetter near the five
sixteenths, carried a lead into upper stretch, drifted out under both left and right handed urging but nonetheless stayed in front to the finish. COAL TOWN
ROAD set a pressured pace inside, shook clear into the turn, set the pace while positioned two wide, was engaged near the five sixteenths when THE LAST
FACT drew even to his inside, drifted out into the lane, was carried further out at THE LAST FACT drifted out, gave chase to the finish but could not reel that
foe back in. UNCLE DICK trailed the rest of the field while racing outside of TRYGVE, was patient in the three to four path on the turn, swung into the lane in
the five path and rallied belatedly for show. WILDCAT HAGRID tracked the leading pair early, advanced to attend outside the leading pair approaching the
half, tracked the leader while positioned three wide around the bend, came into the lane in the four to five path, was no match for the leading pair under a
drive in the lane and flattened out. CHIEF MYSTIQUE prompted the pace outside of COAL TOWN ROAD early, tracked the pacesetter while racing inside of
WILDCAT HAGRID approaching the turn, raced two wide in range until beginning to weaken past the three eighths mark, was driven upper and was no
further threat in the lane. TRYGVE was agitated in the post parade, trailed the rest of the field while racing inside of UNCLE DICK, raced in the two path on
the turn, came into the lane in the three path, and offered no response under a drive.

Footnotes
YAK, brushed, then caught in close quarters at the start, was rated between foes just off the leaders to the backstretch, tipped out three wide after three
furlongs tracking the leaders to the second bend, advanced in that path to bid between foes racing into upper stretch and responded to firm left handed
encouragement to go clear in time. UNBROKEN SONG switched off the inside racing to the first turn tracking the leaders from just out of striking position,
was prompted to advance four wide racing into the far turn, advanced in tandem with the eventual winner into upper stretch but couldn't match that rival's
kick while narrowly prevailing for the place honors. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE was urged along the inside racing to the backstretch dictating the pace on a
narrow advantage, dueled for command on the far turn into the stretch and weakened late. TALLESTOFTHETALL broke inwards brushing the eventual
winner, was prompted to terms with the pacesetter three deep racing to the first turn, continued to prompt just outside the leader into the backstretch,
pressed the pace into the far turn, dueled for command between foes into upper stretch but faded late. NOT VERY GENTLE settled between foes in the last
flight to the backstretch, shifted out five wide racing into upper stretch but had no closing bid. HONEST TO GOODNESS settled outside foes in the last flight
to the backstretch, was fanned six wide into the lane but proved no threat. FINAL CALL broke outwards brushing the eventual winner, was collected, then
settled inside foes racing to the backstretch and faded early.

Footnotes
MY REDEMPTION chased inside early, saved ground in the chasing flight on the turn, was taken off the inside in upper stretch and driven, responded with a
rally and reeled in the leader five jumps from the wire. ALPINE GHOST set the early pace while pressured by LORD DYLAN to his inside, opened up in the
two path on the turn, remained clear through upper stretch, chased under a drive but failed to hold in the last strides. MON AMI FUZZIE chased between
horses early, settled back toward the rear approaching the five eighths, raced near the rear in the two path on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and
began to make up some ground, split horses midstretch under a drive, and improved well belatedly despite drifting out. TWO COOKIE RULE was anxious in
the gate, chased midpack early outside of MY REDEMPTION, raced three wide in the chasing flight on the turn, came into the lane in the six path, and kept
on mildly to prove best of the rest. LORD DYLAN pressed the early pace inside of ALPINE GHOST, settled back to track in the three path on the turn, came
into the lane in the five to six path and proved no match for ALPINE GHOST, chased to midstretch and emptied out in the final furlong. POWERFUL MAN
was wrangled to the rear early, trailed down he backstretch and in the four to five path on the turn, swung eight wide into the lane and offered no rally.
GLOBAL EMPIRE raced close up early but soon settled back to track, chased between horses in the three path on the turn, and proved empty inside in the
lane.

Footnotes
QUEEN'S MISSION broke sharply, sprinted clear of her rivals along the inside racing to the turn, held sway on a comfortable margin into upper stretch and
was kept to firm left handed pressure proving best. RANK AND FILE, a bit reluctant to load, was urged three deep between rivals pursuing the pacesetter on
the backstretch, shifted inwards racing into the turn and continued willingly just outside the winner in late stages to close the gap while gaining the place
honors. SUPERSTAR DIVA was rated off the second flight along the inside racing into the bend, tipped out three wide racing past midstretch but continued
with interest to gain position while edging a rival for a share. FIRST SQUADRON was urged between rivals pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, shifted out
to three path nearing upper stretch and weakened in the drive. FLYING BUSINESS, urged to contend five wide on the backstretch, continued four wide on
the turn into upper stretch and faded late. HOPPESTRY switched outside the leaders dropping well off the second flight on the backstretch and never
gained contention. ARCH FLYER made brief pursuit of the pacesetter four wide between foes in the opening stages, angled inwards nearing the turn and
gave way in the drive. WANNA HAVE FUN, a step slow into stride, never gained contention. HER GOLD MINE, restless prior to the start, broke slowly and
never menaced thereafter.

Footnotes
TRY TRY AGAIN stalked the pace inside, was pushed along in the two path near the five sixteenths into upper stretch, shifted out under a drive, rallied well
and got up just in time. TAKE ME UP BRADY led narrowly early, cleared approaching the half, saved ground on the turn, remained clear through midstretch,
kept on under a drive but was caught in the last strides. TALE OF THE NILE raced toward the rear of the main group inside of NYOMAN early, hugged the
rail on the turn, swung four wide into the lane, drifted out and bumped FIXICO in upper stretch, angled out further near the sixteenth while rallying, found his
best too late but got up for show. NYOMAN raced two wide outside of TALE OF THE NILE early, was pushed along and improved in the five path on the
turn, continued to give chase in the lane and gained on the leading pair late but was outkicked by TALE OF THE NILE for place. FORT RIDGE settled at the
rear, began to improve in the two to three path on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, and improved mildly while angling in late. Z U SOON stalked
the pace between horses, took up near the seven sixteenth when in tight and lost ground, chased inside in the lane but was ultimately outfinished.
SIRCORRI tracked four and then three deep down the backstretch, continued to track the pace in the three path on the turn, was driven in upper stretch and
emptied out three wide in the final furlong. EMOJI GUY settled near the rear inside of OUTRUN THE POSSE early, continued toward the back in the five to
six path on the turn, swung seven wide into the lane, and passed tiring horses. SCARLET CITY chased outside foes early, was pushed along and stalked in
the four path on the turn, was hard driven four wide in upper stretch and emptied out. FIXICO stalked three wide early, settled back to midfield past the five
eighths, chased in the four path on the turn, came six wide into the lane, was bumped by TALE OF THE NILE in upper stretch and had no rally. OUTRUN
THE POSSE settled near the rear outside of EMOJI GUY, trailed in the six to seven path on the turn, came eight wide into the lane and had no rally.

Footnotes
ROYA broke sharply, angled to the inside setting the pace on a narrow advantage into the backstretch, repelled a rival's challenge racing into upper stretch
and edged clear late under firm right handed encouragement. SHE'S XTREMELY HOT was urged prompting a rival's pace from the outset to upper stretch,
proved only second best in the drive. GYPSY WIFE was steadied along the rail when losing her path to BEING CREATIVE racing into the first turn, tracked
off the second flight to the backstretch, switched out five wide racing into the far turn, advanced outside foes in that path to upper stretch and continued well
enough to earn a share. PRESENT OF HERO, bumped at the start, was settled three deep between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch,
continued in that path through the far turn, shifted inwards in the drive and continued with an effort to improve position in late stages. BEZEL SET, bumped,
then clipped by BEING CREATIVE just after the break, was settled last to the far turn, shifted out four wide nearing the lane and gained some position while
lacking the needed closing bid. EMBARRASSING tracked the leaders three deep in second flight to the backstretch, angled inwards racing into the far turn
and steadily faded racing into the lane. NOFANSINTHESTANDS, broke inwards bumping PRESENT OF HERO at the start, settled outside rivals to the
backstretch, raced four wide through the far turn while making some brief progress but came up empty in upper stretch. BEING CREATIVE broke inwards
clipping BEZEL SET at the start, angled sharply to the inside racing into the first turn and emptied out after a half. SPENDER threw her head at the start
while getting away slowly, was urged to regain contention while being caught five wide racing into the first turn, steadily gained position outside foes racing
into the far turn, then gave out abruptly into upper stretch.

Footnotes
BABA'S BOY took up when in tight into the clubhouse turn, raced keenly around the first turn after taking back, settled better down the back stretch, was
patient inside around the far turn, went to a drive inside in upper stretch and began to improve, shifted out near the furlong mark, continued to improve,
caught MISTER CHARMING past the sixteenth mark and cleared late. MISTER CHARMING tracked the pace into the first turn, took the lead outside of
COMING UP ACES into the backstretch, set a pressured pace, was nudged along to clear into the far turn, went to a drive inside in upper stretch, remained
clear through midstretch, but was caught just inside the sixteenth mark. ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS was a bit slow into stride, settled outside of EMPTY
HOLSTER in the rear flight, began to improve near the seven sixteenths, rallied four wide around the turn, came five wide into the lane, proved no match for
the top two but chased on best of the rest. EMPTY HOLSTER was soundly bumped by BUREAU in the opening strides, settled back with the rear pair inside
of ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS, continued at the rear down the back straight and in the three path on the far turn, swung six wide into the lane, and drove
past tiring horses. VITALE tracked the leading pair three wide through the clubhouse turn, tracked them down the backstretch, was pushed along for a two
wide bid to engage the leader on the far turn, was no match for MISTER CHARMING into the lane, and weakened between horses. COMING UP ACES led
into the first turn, was headed by MISTER CHARMING into the back straight, prompted inside that foe from there, tracked the leading pair inside around the
far turn, was outkicked into the lane and flattened out in the final furlong. BUREAU broke inward and soundly bumped EMPTY HOLSTER in the opening
strides, raced in the pocket behind the leading pair around the first turn, chased the leading trio inside down the back straight, chased three wide around the
turn, and came up empty in the lane. KEEP ATTACKING tracked the leading trio two wide through the first turn and down the back straight, began to flatten
past the five eighths, and had no more when driven near the quarter pole.

Footnotes
CALIBRATE was reserved along the inside racing to the first turn, switched outside foes entering the backstretch to race widest to the second bend, was
prompted to advance four wide through the far turn to upper stretch, moved to challenge the pacesetter leaving midstretch and wrested the advantage in the
closing stages under energetic handling. MEGAN'S HONOR, in touch with the pacesetter prompting that rival in the opening half, pressed the issue into the
far turn, edged forward in upper stretch, resisted the winner's challenge to late stages but couldn't contain that rival. MAGIC CASTLE was urged to dictate
the pace on a narrow advantage along the inside to the first turn, maintained that margin through the backstretch, dueled for command into the far turn,
shifted off the inside when losing the advantage but kept on with interest for a share. FIRST MASAMUNE was rated off the second flight near the inside
racing to the backstretch, was urged to split foes nearing upper stretch gaining some position but had no late kick. GITA'S LAD broke sharply, tracked just
off the pacesetter along the inside into the backstretch, then to the far turn but steadily faded nearing the lane. SILVER QUARTERS, off last, was settled last
racing to the far turn, swung out five wide in upper stretch but made no impression. TONYS MORNING LINE, pulling a bit three deep racing to the first turn,
tracked off the first flight racing outside a rival in the second bend, lost ground to the top pair nearing upper stretch and gave way into the lane. QUANTUM
LEAP tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, faded three deep between foes nearing the lane and was fanned six wide while
dropping out last.

Footnotes
JACKS SPRING BREAK briefly had the neck of the awkwardly-breaking RIP IT RYAN hooked over his in the opening strides, soon shook loose and got
position chasing midfield inside, was keen to join the tracking flight into the backstretch, improved between the tracking horses on the far turn, engaged
outside of ASTI SKY approaching the quarter, was outkicked into upper stretch but continued to give chase, went to a drive near the three sixteenths, vied
with ASTI SKY while drifting in and out, and cleared in the last fifty yards. ASTI SKY carried a narrow lead two wide through the first turn, continued to set a
reasonable pace despite prompting from both sides down the backstretch and around the far turn, carried a narrow lead down the lane outside of MINISTRY
OF ART, was engaged for good to his outside by JACKS SPRING BREAK tnearing the sixteenth mark as MINISTRY OF ART began to flatten to his inside,
and could not hold off JACKS SPRING BREAK in the final fifty yards. MINISTRY OF ART cleared to the inside of the leading flight into the first turn,
attended the pace inside of ASTI SKY, hugged the rail around the far turn, was driven inside in upper stretch, continued in range inside of ASTI SKY past
the furlong mark but flattened out from just before the sixteenth pole. ARBUCKLE OUTLAW tracked between horses around the first turn, was keen to join
outside the leading pair into the back straight, joined the leading flight three wide for the backstretch run, tracked the pace four wide around the far turn,
came into the lane five wide, was no match for the leaders into the stretch, but chased on mildly to prove best of the rest. BLOOMING GARDEN bobbled at
the start, raced three wide in the tracking flight, chased five wide around the far turn and into the lane, and proved no threat under a drive in the lane. RIP IT
RYAN broke inward extremely awkwardly, tossed his head, and briefly hooked it around the neck of JACKS SPRING BREAK in the opening strides, was
wrangled back to the rear, continued at the rear, was driven in the three path on the far turn, raced three wide into the stretch, and improved mildly to get
past tiring foes. STORM'S REFLECTION tracked inside foes around the far turn, was keen while tracking the leading line down the back straight, chased in
the two path around the second turn, proved no match into the lane and weakened. DARE GOES DA DEVIL settled near the rear inside of OFF TO THE
BEACH, continued near the rear well behind the tracking flight down the back straight, raced in the two path around the far turn, came into the lane two wide
and did not muster a rally. OFF TO THE BEACH settled toward the rear outside of DARE GOES DA DEVIL, continued near the rear down the back straight
and in the three path on the second turn, came four wide into the lane and lacked a bid. B'S TURNING POINT settled in second last, raced in the three to
four path on the far turn, came five wide into the lane and lacked a rally.
