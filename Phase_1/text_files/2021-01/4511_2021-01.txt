turn, made a bid passing the five-sixteenths, took over into upper stretch, disposed of the runner-up into the final furlong then edged clear while still on his
inside lead under steady urging. C'MON VE was away alertly, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, was headed by the
winner into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and was outfinished while clear for the place. BORN AGAIN GEORGE was ridden along on the
outside, went four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch then pulled in to elicit a lead change and lacked the needed response while able to
get the show. WHY JOEY WHY brushed with a rival at the start, dropped back while climbing behind horses at the rear early, went around the turn in the
two path, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. FIRE BLASTER was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn and came up
empty. RECKLESS RANSOM brushed with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, was urged along between horses in the two path on the turn and failed to
respond. FREE INDEED was urged along on the inside, saved ground on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and had nothing left.

after the start, went three wide on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, went three wide on the far turn, swerved six wide into the stretch, drifted out near
the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. JEFE dropped from the two path to the rail early on the first turn, moved out at the rear early on the
backstretch then was urged along, went four wide on the far turn, was driven seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. DREAM HALO was keen
under restraint while inside to the two path on the first turn then rated off the pace, raced inside early on the far turn then moved to two path while steadying
off heels at the five-sixteenths and failed to respond. AWESOME PARTY broke out and bumped hard with a foe, bumped hard with another foe while also
bumping again the first foe after the start, went four wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, drew even in the three path on the far turn,
dropped back into the stretch and faded. V MAN was hustled to the lead, went around the first turn in the two path, set the pace with company of two foes to
his outside, was headed under urging while inside early on the far turn, took an awkward stride passing the three-eighths and stopped then was eased in the
final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
TREYS MIDNITE MOON was taken in hand early, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, went two then three wide early on
the far turn then moved to four wide late on that bend, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead into the final furlong then drew clear
under strong urging. ANTARCTIC went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, moved up to make a bid at the nine-sixteenths, vied two
to three wide on the far turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole then was set down in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner into the final furlong and
proved no match while clear for the place. CHOP CHOP CHARLIE was hustled to the lead, set the pace while inside to the two path, lost the advantage into
the stretch, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. EXECUTIVE BONUS bumped with a rival after the start, was taken in hand
early, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, moved closer with a half-mile to run, rounded the far turn in the two path, came four wide
into the stretch then moved further out at the three-sixteenths and just missed the show. KING OF CANDY went four wide on the first turn, was rated on the
outside, came under urging while three wide on the far turn then was driven four wide into the stretch and tired. FLEETWAY went four wide on the first turn,
moved in while well placed down the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. KILLEEN went three
wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved closer with a half-mile to run, was urged along while moving from three to five wide on the far turn, came
six wide into the stretch and had nothing left. HIDEAWAY HERO moved in at the rear early, went around the turns in the two path and was no factor.

RUSSIAN MAFIA broke a step slow, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, was reserved towards the rear, saved ground for most of the far turn then
shifted to the two path, moved out while put to a drive in upper stretch, dropped in while gaining at the furlong marker, rallied to make a bid between horses
into the final sixteenth and got up under vigorous handling. YLIKEDIS went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, went two then three
wide on the far turn then rallied four wide into the stretch, took a narrow advantage at the three-sixteenths, fought on ever terms for the lead into the final
sixteenth and missed while just able to get the place. WEST BANK BABY was hustled to the front, set the pace on the inside, was asked at the quarter-pole
then came under a drive in upper stretch, fought on well into the final sixteenth and just missed the place while clear for the show. ALTA'S AWARD settled
on the inside, was given her cue near the five-sixteenths, moved off the rail under a drive in upper stretch, chased under the whip into the final furlong and
weakened. FLASHING RED went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the two path on the far turn, battled under a
drive in upper stretch, dropped back while carried in some nearing the furlong marker and tired. AIFE stood in the gate at the start and dwelt, came out over
fifteen lengths behind the rest of the field, rounded the turns in the two path, came three wide into the stretch then moved further out and was no factor.

upper stretch and tired. BOOTH ROAD SHINE broke a step slow, was rated off the pace under tight restraint then dropped back at the half-mile pole, went
four then five wide on the turn, floated eight wide into the stretch and was no factor. CAJUN CHAOS tugged hard at the bit while rated just off the pace
under tight restraint, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn and came up empty. ONEHOLYLION was off a couple of lengths slow, settled on the
outside, was urged five then six wide on the turn, dropped back seven wide into the stretch and failed to respond.
