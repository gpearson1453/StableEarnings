Footnotes
CHARMING ALEXIS broke well and cleared off on the backstretch, entered turn clear and on the inside, entered stretch clear and continued clear past the
sixteenth, held safely while rival made up ground late. BELLIGERENT broke well and chased quicker rival in the two path on the backstretch, continued two
wide into the turn, took aim on rival in the stretch and failed to make up enough ground in the stretch. MAGICALCHIC tracked clear leader along the inside
on the backstretch, continued the ground saving trip into the turn and into the stretch, failed to make a menacing bid at leaders while clearly holding third.
FIERY CAUSE settled along the rail on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn and into the stretch, kept on evenly in the stretch to hold
position. MY PROJECT GIRL bore out at the start 5 lanes, stalked leaders three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn and failed to
launch a rally in the stretch. HAPPIER TOGETHER stalked pacesetters off the rail in the two path on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn and
never threatened.
