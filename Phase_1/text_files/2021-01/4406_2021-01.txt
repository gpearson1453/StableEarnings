turn, made a bid at the quarter-pole then took the lead in upper stretch, shook clear outside the furlong marker, led into the final sixteenth but was caught
while clear for the place. BETTER BIZ brushed with a foe early then was taken in hand, went three wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, came
under urging in the three path on the far turn and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. LADY KAZA angled in while going to the front then
went clear early, set the pace on the inside, was asked while challenged at the quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into
the final furlong and tired. TUPELO HON E broke out at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along in the two path on

Footnotes
MALIBU MOIRA went three wide on the first turn, was forwardly placed on the outside, came under urging while three wide on the far turn, made a bid
passing the five-sixteenths, drifted in just after turning into the stretch and put the runner-up in tight, battled outside of LIMAGE into the final furlong then
shook clear and held under strong urging. CLOSE TO ME bumped with a rival into the first turn, dropped from the two path to the rail while keen under tight
restraint on that bend, stalked outside the leader on the backstretch, chased in the two path on the far turn, made a bid nearing the five-sixteenths, steadied
when the winner came in just after turning into the stretch, angled out inside the three-sixteenths and finished willingly for the place. LIMAGE broke in then
was hustled to the lead, set the pace on the inside, was asked near the quarter-pole then lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch, fought on with the
winner into the final furlong and weakened but held the show. SUNDEREYA went three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under urging
in the two path on the far turn, was driven three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. OUR SLICK CHICK went four wide on the first turn,
was guided in entering the backstretch, established a good position just off the pace, drafted inside to the two path on the far turn, was asked outside the
quarter-pole, moved out under a drive in upper stretch then shifted further out around the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. MELODY ROSE
bumped with a rival into the first turn, went three wide on that bend, settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the far turn then came five wide into the
stretch under the whip and failed to respond. CHRISTEANA'S KISS went three to four wide on the turns, turned into the stretch under a drive and failed to
threaten. KATIE THE CUTIE was unsettled in the gate then acted-up just as the gate opened, reared very badly and was off extremely slow, went two to

while closing well coming to the eighth-pole, took the lead inside that pole and prevailed under strong urging. SPYCRAFT bumped with a rival at the start,
was taken in hand while showing early speed, raced in the two path on the first turn, was rated in second position, moved closer late on the backstretch,
was given his cue in the three path on the far turn, took the lead in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong then lost the advantage to the winner
and was outfinished while clear for the place. EAST LEX broke out and hit the gate then bumped with a rival, saved ground on the first turn, was urged
along towards the rear with a half-mile to run, rounded the far turn in the two path, angled out in upper stretch and finished willingly to get the show.
DOODLE TIME went three wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, traveled around the far turn in the two path, moved out while put to a drive
just inside the three-sixteenths, lugged in near the furlong marker then moved back out again and just missed the show. CHANTRY FLATS moved in early
then was rated on the inside, advanced closer late on the backstretch, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then chased under a
drive and lacked the needed kick. BIARRITZ went to the front then was taken in hand, set the pace while inside to the two path, was asked in the two path
under threat on the far turn, lost the advantage before the three-sixteenths and gave way. LOOKIN HIGH went four wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, was urged four wide on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to threaten. BOTSWANA TAPS moved out at the rear, went

outside the quarter-pole, chased outside into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. LAFITTE'S FLEET broke a half-step
slow, moved in midway down the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. VERIFIED broke a half-step slow, settled off the pace,
went three wide on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole then came four wide into the stretch, dropped back passing the three-sixteenths and

Footnotes
LUCK OF THE DRAW brushed the outside of the gate at the start then was hustled, angled in early then saved ground on the first turn, was well placed just
off the pace, moved out near the half-mile pole, ranged up four wide to make a bid midway through the final turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and proved
best under steady urging. JOEMO broke in at the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path for most
of the far turn, angled four wide outside the quarter-pole then was driven five wide into the stretch and secured the place while unable to threaten the
winner. CITY PARK went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged two to three wide on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper
stretch and lacked the needed response while just up for the show. VENN went around the first turn in the two path, prompted the pace on the inside of the
leader, vied inside on the far turn, raced in hand inside the three-eighths, was asked while dropping back at the five-sixteenths, chased under a drive into
the stretch and weakened then just missed the show. DRILLING REPORT went four then three wide on the first turn, disputed the pace on the outside, vied
three wide on the far turn and tired. SILVER KING went four wide on the first turn, was reserved at the rear, moved closer with a half-mile to run, shifted
from three to five wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch, drifted in near the furlong marker and failed to rally. TENSAS TODDY was hustled from
the start, went three then four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace, was carried out while dropping back around the half-mile pole, went four wide on the
far turn and retreated then was distanced in the final furlong. BAQUERO'S BIND broke out at the start, went five wide on the first turn, settled near the back,
was urged along midway down the backstretch and faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off. TAKING NOTES broke out then was hustled, went
six wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, dropped back after a half-mile and also faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off.
