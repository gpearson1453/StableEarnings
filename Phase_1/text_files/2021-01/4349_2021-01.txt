Footnotes
RUN THE BLUES AWAY was away in good order to duel for the early fractions with MARK WHATS MINE while racing three-wide, disposed of that rival
after going three furlongs and held UNAFIESTAPARATODOS safely to the wire. UNAFIESTAPARATODOS was reserved just off the leaders early,
advanced four-wide through the turn, reached a striking position in mid-stretch but failed to gain on the winner late. TAKE HER TEMP was hustled along to
be forwardly placed early, moved three-wide though the turn, reached a contending position and lacked the needed late response. MARK WHATS MINE
broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner from between foes, could not match strides with that rival but stayed on well in the drive. KOKO'S MOM
settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly. RED BETTE was off a step slow, raced four-wide through the turn,
angled out into the stretch and failed to menace. SCARLET SAMBA showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the
three-sixteenths and was not a factor. CAMELLIA CITY pressed the pace from the inside for three furlongs and weakened. FRONT BURNER showed brief
speed and weakened.

Footnotes
GOOD TIME DOLLY broke sharply then was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, offered a bid with a furlong to run and
edged away through the closing yards. WINNING APPEAL dueled for the lead from the inside, responded when challenged by DON'T RUB IT into the
stretch, vied with that rival and gave way grudgingly to the winner late. DON'T RUB IT stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to engage
nearing the three-sixteenths pole, vied and gave way late. DIVALICIOUS was off a step slow, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the
turn and finished evenly in the drive. DAISY FIELD lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and was not a factor.
KRISTIN'S PICNIC disputed the pace from between foes for a half and weakened. MARVELOUS MARVELLA was void of early speed, raced four-wide
through the turn and did not threaten. DANCE WITH KRISTIN lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.
GOPREACHIT was away in good order to show brief speed and weakened. LA PERLITA NEGRA raced off the pacesetters from the inside and gradually
weakened.

Footnotes
COLAVITO was never far back while racing along the inside, angled out into the stretch, moved between rivals with a furlong to run and edged away.
DARCEE'S LOVI DOVI was away in good order to press the pace while racing four-wide dropped back nearing the five-sixteenths pole, re-bid with a furlong
to run but could not match strides with the winner late. MR. ARTISTIC was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, checked
nearing the three-sixteenths pole, angled out and finished willingly. KODIACTION settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled
out in mid-stretch and finished evenly. THE SHYSTER was slow to begin, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and did not threaten. PHANTOM DROP pressed the pace from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and gave way in the
drive. RIVER KAI raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late response. WYNNVILLE lacked early foot,
raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. DOGHOUSE set a pressured pace from the inside and weakened through the final sixteenth.
RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention. ERRIGAL settled off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive. BIG ERROR lagged throughout.

Footnotes
RAGING WATERS broke out to bump rival, settled off the leaders early, moved between rivals in mid-stretch to gain command and drew clear.
THEYREMINISCEOVERU was bumped at the break, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and
finished with a steady rally. CITY CHAMP was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the sixteenth pole and
finished willingly. BOBBY'S ALIBI dueled for the lead while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. COPPER HALO raced off the
pacesetters early, saved ground through the turn, lacked racing room nearing the quarter and again in mid-stretch and failed to menace when clear.
ROUSING SLAMMER disputed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. A LITTLE BIT LUCKY pressed the pace while racing
four-wide and weakened after a half. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERNING THE BUMPING AT THE START BETWEEN RAGING
WATERS AND THEYREMINISCEOVERU AT THE BREAK AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS CONCLUDED RACING WATERS HAD BROKE
OUTWARD AND BUMPED THEYREMINISCEOVERU HOWEVER THEY CONCLUDED THAT IT DID NOT AFFECT THE OUTCOME OR PLACING AND
MADE NO CHANGE.

STALKING SHADOW was allowed to settle early, advanced five-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and quickly drew off.
TRIBAL NATION stalked the pace of OKOYE while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths marker, remained in control
through mid-stretch but could not match strides with the winner late. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out
approaching the stretch, could not gain on the top pair in the drive but held on to save the show. BERNALINHO hopped at the start, raced unhurried early,
moved six-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. TWICE THE PRICE was forwardly placed from between foes, moved four-wide through
the second turn and gave way in the drive. SOONER THAN SOONER raced four-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide
through the second turn and failed to rally. OMPH was off a step slow, lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn and did not offer a bid.
OKOYE sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
KALINE appeared hard to rate, raced four-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out in
mid-stretch and was up in the closing yards to be going away late. KNOWN was away in good order to press the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to
offer a bid nearing the five-eighths marker, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole, remained in control through mid-stretch and gave way to
the winner grudgingly late. PRAISE LOUDLY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished willingly in the
drive. TEQUILA BLANCO raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out in mid-stretch, bumped with NORTHERN
QUEST nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with a belated bid. NORTHERN QUEST lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled
out further with a furlong to run, bumped with TEQUILA BLANCO nearing the sixteenth pole and did not menace. BLUES RAPPER showed no early speed,
advanced three-wide through the second turn, reached a contending position and failed to gain late. HAWK'S RISING set a pressured pace from the inside
and weakened after going six furlongs. REDACTION settled off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened. GOT TOBE AWESOME raced
five-wide through the first turn, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. COLLUSION DELUSION was off a step
slow then allowed to settle and did not reach contention.
