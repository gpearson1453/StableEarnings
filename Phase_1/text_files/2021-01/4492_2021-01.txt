Footnotes
LITTLE MISS BELLE tracked the early pace, went six wide into the second turn, was gaining late and was up in time for the win. TIPARILLO stalked the
early pace from the inside, made a middle move while taking control through the home turn, couldn't sustain the run and finished second best. UNUSUAL
DANCER was allowed to settle early, raced along the inside into the home turn, angled out in early stretch and flattened out. EASY DOES IT set the early
pace, raced off the rail into both turns, drifted out in early stretch and weakened. PROSSER'S KITTEN was unhurried early, went four wide into the second
turn and never fired. HAVEN'S JOY was void of any early speed, went five wide into the second turn and offered no late rally. THE RACE WAS HAND
TIMED.

SPUN LINE stalked the early pace, found room along the inside, made a bid on LUCK BE MINE in mid stretch, shook clear from that rivals and held for the
win. HIT IT TWICE was unhurried early, advanced five wide through the turn, was gaining late and just missed. LUCK BE MINE set a pressured early pace,
raced off the rail into the turn, met the bid of the winner, couldn't sustain the pace and weakened late stretch. SHEZA DANDY R F pressed the early pace,
raced six wide out of the turn and faded. B C Z MIDDLETON was void of any early speed, went four wide into the turn and offered no late rally. DADDY'S
MELODY was allowed to settle early, raced seven wide and was empty. JANET'S MAE reared at the start and walked off.
