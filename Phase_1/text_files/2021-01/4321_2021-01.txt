Footnotes
WELD broke readily, raced unhurried tracking off the first flight in the opening quarter, advanced three deep on the turn to challenge for command nearing
upper stretch, wrested the advantage and held sway through the lane under firm encouragement. BOOYAKASHA tracked off the first flight outside the
eventual winner racing to the turn, then continued four wide through the bend to upper stretch to prove best of the others. SHAKEM N BREAKEM bobbled at
the start, settled last to the turn, angled out four wide in the stretch and found his best stride in late stages to edge a rival for a share. GRAN CASIQUE,
urged inside a rival prompting the pace in the opening quarter, conceded some position racing into the turn while switching outside that foe, continued with a
bid between rivals on the turn and faded leaving midstretch. RATTLESNAKE RIDGE was urged to force the pace outside a rival through the backstretch,
went briefly clear while shifting to the inside on the turn, couldn't fend off the winner and gave way in the drive. INDY RIDE angled inside tracking off the
second flight racing to the turn but failed to menace thereafter.

Footnotes
TALK OR LISTEN (IRE), reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily drew into contention while shifting off the inside nearing the far turn,
angled back to the inside entering the bend, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, split foes when presented an opening entering the lane to
challenge for command and edged forward to a narrow advantage in time under firm left handed pressure. EONS was rated tracking the pacesetter from
just out of striking distance along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted off the rail advancing in tandem with several rivals to bid for command between
foes midway through the far turn, shifted three deep disputing the issue in a grudging effort racing past midstretch and prevailed for the place honors while
failing to contain the winner. GRAND JOURNEY, reserved off the second flight, angled to the inside nearing the backstretch, shifted out three wide gaining
on the leader nearing the far turn, moved to challenge while being fanned four wide into upper stretch and disputed the issue to late stages while just
outkicked by the top pair. WICKED WARRIOR sped to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, dictated the pace on a clear margin to
the far turn, briefly resisted when challenged nearing the lane but gave out late. SENTRY settled last to the backstretch and never gained contention. LOST
IN LIMBO was rated tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking distance outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was prompted to lodge a brief bid
three wide between foes on the far turn but emptied out abruptly entering the lane.

Footnotes
LA CHICA LATERAL was urged inside foes disputing the pace on a narrow advantage into the turn, edged clear in upper stretch while shifting a bit off the
rail and extended her advantage under pressure. GRIMHILDE was urged prompting the eventual winner's pace racing into the turn, proved no match in late
stages but narrowly prevailed for the place honors. BETO'S GIRL tracked just off the first flight between foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside
entering the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and just missed for second. JULIE'S GRACE, off slowly, then shuffled out of tight quarters at the start,
tracked off the second flight three deep between foes, split rivals in that path nearing the lane and continued with an even effort to improve position.
ECLIPTICALS DOLLY, urged to a forward placing three wide tracking just off the leaders racing into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. INPENDING
BREEZE settled off the second flight racing four wide on the backstretch and proved no threat. ELLIE BE DANCING tracked just off the first flight inside
rivals to the turn but faded early. ASTERS D'ORO shifted out four wide racing through the backstretch, bore out racing through the turn and was eased in
late stages.

Footnotes
UNLEASH ME, shut off at the start while breaking a step slowly, quickly recovered to gain terms with the first flight while caught five wide on the backstretch
dropped off a bit off the leaders racing into the turn, was prompted to advance four deep nearing upper stretch, shifted inwards under pressure to bid three
deep midstretch and wrested a narrow advantage in time under firm encouragement in a game effort. FRANKIE Z, urged between foes, then along the
inside disputing the pace into the turn, resisted grudgingly to late stages but just failed to contain the winner. ALMONASTER, bumped at the start, recovered
quickly to join the pace four wide between foes pressing the issue through the backstretch, continued three deep into the bend gaining a narrow advantage,
dueled between foes past midstretch but yielded to the top pair late. LITTLE DUDE, urged inside rivals prompting the pace in the opening stages, was
eased off the leaders nearing the turn while shifting off the inside, angled four wide in upper stretch and continued with an even effort late. HESALITTLE
SHADY veered out at the start crossing the eventual winner's path while bumping ALMONASTER, was righted to press the issue three deep between foes
to the turn and gave way into upper stretch. NOTHIN REALLY exchanged bumps with DREAMING OF GUS at the start, dropped out last in early stages
and never menaced thereafter. DREAMING OF GUS exchanged bumps at the start, angled to the inside early while making brief pursuit of the leaders but
soon retreated.

Footnotes
BEE MAJOR was rated off the second flight while shifting inwards racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three wide on the far turn, wrested
the advantage racing into upper stretch and kicked clear under firm handling. BUC'S INVESTMINT settled into stride dropping well off the leaders racing to
the backstretch, advanced to contention four wide on the far turn to upper stretch and proved best of the others. JUAN BOLY, forwardly placed along the
rail, tracked just off the leaders along the inside to the far turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch making firm contact with GENERAL but continued with
interest to edge that rival for a share. GENERAL was rated off the second flight near the inside, shifted outside foes nearing upper stretch, was bumped
nearing midstretch and was outkicked for a share. WITH REWARD, urged to the lead outside a rival racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow
margin along the inside to the second bend, dueled inside foes to upper stretch and gave way late. INSIDER TRADING, off slowly, was settled outside foes
racing to the backstretch, was caught wide nearing the far turn and had no rally. FLORIDA EXPRESS settled near the inside and offered no rally. LOOKIN
FOREVER dropped well off the field early and proved no threat. IMPERIAL GUARD, held up avoiding tight quarters leaving the chute, shifted out three deep
racing into the backstretch while being prompted to a position just off the leaders, was urged to make brief progress between foes but quickly came up
empty. DONEGAL ACES, pulling a bit while shifting inwards leaving the chute gaining a position just off the leaders, was fanned four wide racing into the
backstretch, was prompted in brief pursuit outside foes to the second bend but soon gave way.

handed encouragement. HE HAD A SECRET tracked just off the first flight three deep racing through the backstretch, was urged to advance in that path
bidding for command entering the turn, shifted inwards nearing the lane to gain a brief advantage between calls but couldn't contain the winner while just
lasting for second. CHAMPIONSHIP ALLEY shied outwards at the start avoiding GOT FASHION while shifting into the path of COMPANY STORE bumping
that rival, tracked off the first flight inside foes, switched outside rivals midway through the turn, angled four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with

Footnotes
PIONEEROF NEW YORK broke readily, was taken in hand to track just off the leaders racing to the first turn, shifted out entering the backstretch while
moving to terms with the pacesetter after a half prompting that rival, pressed the issue on the far turn to gain a narrow advantage nearing midstretch, then
shifted out in the closing stages but held BACI on a safe margin under right handed pressure. The latter, forwardly placed along the inside racing through
the chute, tracked just off the leaders to the far turn, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance and moved to close the
gap on the winner while never gaining even terms. MAKEME DREAM was rated off the first flight along the inside, shifted out entering the lane and
continued with interest between foes to prevail for a share. FALL MOON was rated outside a rival in second flight to the far turn, was fanned three wide
racing through the lane and finished evenly in late stages. CHICK'S SHADOW was urged to the lead while angling to the rail leaving the chute, set the pace
on a clear margin to the backstretch, briefly alternated with a rival on the lead dueling for command into the far turn, pressed the issue to upper stretch and
gave out late. ACT LIKE ARTIE was rated just off the second flight near the inside racing to the far turn but came up empty entering the stretch. WRITTEN
IN RED dropped well off the field early.

Footnotes
BAYDAR took up a position four wide racing behind the second flight from out of striking distance in the opening stages, was prompted to advance three
wide into the bend, moved to wrest command in that path entering upper stretch and drew away in the final stages under firm right handed encouragement.
LUCKY FIND, gained a position just off the second flight while shifting inwards avoiding tight quarters leaving the chute bumping DUCHESS OF SUSSEX,
came through close quarters after the opening quarter shifting off the inside, was prompted to advance splitting rivals three wide into upper stretch and
prevailed for the place honors late. BIONIC BOTTLE shifted inwards leaving the chute to track just off the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the turn, was
prompted to advance on the leader in tandem with several rivals racing into the turn, dueled inside the eventual winner into upper stretch and weakened
late. ELUSIVE AMELIA settled between foes dropping off the second flight on the backstretch, then continued with a steady effort to improve position three
deep between foes into the lane. BIG BASE settled outside foes in early stages, was prompted to advance while being fanned five wide racing into the lane
and gained some position in an even effort. PIONEER WOMAN tracked off the second flight outside foes in early stages, raced four wide through the turn to
upper stretch and faded late. TWIRLING STAR, cut off, then shuffled back at the start, swung out six wide racing into the stretch but made no impression.
DUCHESS OF SUSSEX ducked in sharply at the start impeding TWIRLING STAR, angled to the inside racing past the chute tracking off the second flight,
was bumped entering the backstretch, then steadied out of tight quarters and failed to menace thereafter. RUSSIAN ROULETTE angled to the inside early
pursuing the pacesetter as part of the second flight racing into the turn and emptied out nearing upper stretch. HIFALUTIN ducked out at the start, was
quickly righted, then hustled clear along the inside racing through the backstretch, was headed nearing upper stretch and gave way into the lane.

Footnotes
MILBURN gained a forward placing along the rail in the opening stages, was rated just off the second flight racing to the first turn, came through inside foes
to track just off the pacesetter racing to the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch awaiting an opening, came through to challenge along the rail midstretch
and edged forward late under right handed pressure. FLY NIGHTLY was rated off the second flight racing a bit off the inside to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance nearing upper stretch while shifting out four wide, then steadily gained position between foes in that path to close the gap on the
winner while prevailing for the place honors. JOY CITY, urged to the lead racing through the chute while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow
margin along the inside to the far turn, dueled inside foes to upper stretch, shifted out entering the lane resisting several challengers but yielded to the top
pair late. MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY stalked just off the pacesetter between foes racing to the backstretch, advanced to press the issue into the far turn, dueled
to upper stretch but had no final kick. UGLY DUCKLING, caught wide leaving the chute while being prompted to contend, dropped off the second flight to
track outside foes to the far turn, was prompted to advance four, then five wide nearing upper stretch and lacked the needed final kick. INITFORTHELOVE
settled out of striking distance while working his way to the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, then gained some position along
the rail in late stages but was outkicked. IN HONOR OF ARTIE settled last to the backstretch and never gained contention. VIOLATOR, urged to a forward
placing three wide tracking the pacesetter in second flight, lodged a brief bid racing into the far turn but came up empty in the drive. MASPERO, bumped at
the start, settled between foes in the last flight early and faded into the lane. TIZ LUNA broke in the air bumping MASPERO and dropped out after a half.
