Footnotes
BEAUTIFUL KAREN away forwardly placed, tucked into the two path proceeding along the backstretch, showed the way on a narrow margin, tailed by a
well-rated QUALIFYING OFFER positioned out in the three path, got set down stepping onto the top of the lane, shook off the aforementioned foe's feeble
bid, then, although a bit erratic in the final eighth, managed to hold sway. VIENNA CODE one of three on near even terms with each other at the break, with
the other two being the eventual pace contestants, dropped back after being taken in hand, departed the backstretch from the three path, was asked to pick
up interest a sixteenth shy of the quarter pole, fanned outward for the stretch run, settling in the neighborhood of path six when down, had a good, albeit
belated, finish down the center of the strip to be along for second. QUALIFYING OFFER sparred with the winner from the three path, unleashed a tepid bid
in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, weakened into the show slot after proving not up to the task at hand. EQUANT got set up in midpack, travelled
two to three wide on the turn, got sent out into path five entering the stretch, made no headway. DAY'S HUMOR in path four both onto and then off of the
turn, gave way. VOICE OF SPRING darted over to the rail coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, was never heard from.

Footnotes
VIRADIA brushed at the start by WHYISSHESOOLUCKY, who broke inwards, chased five then four wide in aim of the leader advancing to apply pressure
through the turn in hand, took over command and swung four wide into upper stretch, got roused at the three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive and held
gamely to the finish. VIOLENT TRICK established the front and showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths
under threat, got headed for the front near the quarter pole and spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive fighting on to the finish while well
clear for the place honors. MONGOLIAN HUMOR four then three wide in range of the front, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got shaken off through
the latter portion of the turn and swung four to five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top pair while keeping on well clear of the rest for the
show honors. WHYISSHESOOLUCKY broke in at the start brushing VIRADIA, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five
wide for home and weakened. PERSIAN QUEEN chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. DRAGONESS three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled
four wide into upper stretch and tired. SISTER ALEXA lunged at the break, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six
wide into upper stretch and was eased through to the finish.

EXCELLORATOR away without apparent mishap, sat reserved two to three wide on the turn, angled four wide for the drive home, honed in on the ones to
catch, bested CHARLIE FIVE O after a late duel and inched clear. CHARLIE FIVE O flicked off some light contact with CONFORMIST in the shadow of the
gate to assume a forward position, was well held sparring for control in path three, matched up with the earlier-mentioned opponent, was already narrowly in
front heading for path four entering the stretch, clung to the advantage, despite being force to shy out slightly deep into the furlong grounds, became
engaged with the top one soon afterwards, wound up being the one denied. CONFORMIST went on to vie from path two with the second place finisher after
the pair brushed with each other at the start, came under stronger handling by the five-sixteenths pole, got headed, stepped into the lane, tried to battle back
before weakening a bit in the final furlong. MEETMEINCALI set up along the inside prior to leaving the backstretch, proved to be the lone member of this
quintet to spend significant time along the rail, was put to a hand ride travelling about the turn, cut the corner into the stretch and faltered. BOWING
SNOWMAN two wide on the turn, was steered out into path five exiting it, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SQUARE SHOOTER secured a prominent position on the backstretch, was on hold keeping watch on a three-way contested pace dispute a short distance
up ahead, was cued up as the second split was about to be posted, got steered out into path five from upper to midlane, struck the front end by a slim
margin at the start of the final furlong, cemented itself to the top and kicked away. CLENCH set in the three path, vied as the outermost of a threesome for
the lead for the majority of the opening half, settled in upper stretch and was called upon, saw the winner take over deep into the furlong grounds, held on
well to save second. TOPPER T taken hold of getting squeezed after a series of bumps in rapid succession with rivals from both sides at the start, dove
onto the inside route, moved up under his own power to nail down the pocket slot, bided time tracking the disputed pace, was forced to remain on hold
caught behind the front runners during the final stages of the run around bend, stepped onto the top of the lane, idled along under the same predicament as
before for the next sixteenth, gradually maneuvered its way over towards path six and into some racing room, came home with good energy in the last
eighth to be along for the show. HONORABLE SERVICE saved ground for nearly a half, angled four to five wide into the lane, rallied mildly. AIR ATTACK
cut over to the rail after undergoing several light bumps with another at the start, got put to a drive swinging to the outside as the half was being rattled off,
wound up towards path four when done, lacked a solid closing punch. MCERIN tucked into the two path, contended for the top from between rivals for over
a half before giving way. SKYLER'S SCRAMJET strung out three to four wide on the turn, wandered out into path seven during the drive, venturing onward
as the widest of all, never made his presence felt. VINEYARD SOUND bumped a few times right after the start, was on the rail arguing for control afterwards
against a pair of foes to the outside until the head of the stretch, folded.

under pressure from a pair, took to the two path through the turn patiently handled, spun just off the inside for home, got roused nearing the eighth pole
edging clear, held well to prevail. FOREVER CHANGED bumped at the start by JUMP FOR JOY, who broke inwards, chased just off the inside getting set
down at the head of the stretch, ran on through to the finish to be along willingly for the place honors. DOVEY LOVEY three wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish to procure the show honors. BAY JEWEL coaxed from
the gate, prompted the leader from the outside in the three path placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, continued three wide into upper stretch,
weakened in the drive. SWEET KISSES coaxed from the start, raced four wide in aim of the front coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to

Footnotes
IT'S GRAVY along the outside, settled into the three path, was patiently ridden keeping watch on the contested pace, stepped into the stretch, was given his
cue right around the three-sixteenths pole, hitched up to its fellow in-the-money finishers, battled onward with good courage, eventually grinding his way
past a pair of stubborn foes with a few jumps to spare before the finish line to prove best. BREW PUB remained forwardly placed after the field had been
sent on its way, was in path three vying as the outermost of a threesome from the seven-eighths marker until the top of the turn, then went at it one on one
with B C GLORY DAYS, was coming up to the three-sixteenths pole when switched over to stronger handling, had the top one burst upon the scene, vied
with vigour from between foes the rest of the journey to the wire, gamely got up for the place. B C GLORY DAYS remained stationed along the inside route,
was forced to fend off a pair of opponents to the outside from the top of the backstretch until the top of the turn, dueled with BREW PUB thereafter until the
general area of the three-sixteenths pole, saw the pace dispute morph back intoa three-way one, dug in with good determination while hounded from that
juncture onward, relinquished reluctantly in deep stretch then got beat by the narrowest of margins for the place. BIG LITTLE RISK grabbed hold after
lunging in slightly at the start, cut over to the rail in rapid order, rode it until the end of the bend, remained on hold idling along behind some others
approaching the quarter pole and would continue to do so for the next sixteenth, tipped a bit wider, had no closing punch. OLIVER'S FORTUNE steadied
while appearing unsettled on the chute, raced four wide on the turn, was in the same path entering the stretch, launched no bids. RUSE underwent a two
wide trip and gave way. DOUBLEPOUR two to three wide on the turn, got sent out five into lane to no avail. SCHERZANDO disputed the pace two wide
from between rivals from the seven-eighths pole to the seven-sixteenths marker, steadily retreated thereafter.

Footnotes
SECRET LOVE broke outwards brushing the off side stall at the start, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch in closest aim of the leader,
tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, took over command straightened
away and inched away under a drive kept to task. LAOBANONAPRAYER five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn
placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five then four wide for home straightened away, ran on to chase the winner home and was just up for the
place honors in the final jumps. VACAY chased three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered
three wide into uppers tretch and offered up a mild kick. ROSSA VELOCE showed the way in hand three paths off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from
home, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch under threat, yielded the front straightened away and weakened in the final furlong. A LIFE
THAT'S GOOD chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from three furlongs out,
angled five wide at the head of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BRASS RING contended for command from off the inside, made it into path two prior to departing the backstretch, fended off a pair of opponents out in
paths three and four themselves, got set down as the third fraction was being finalized, went onward for another sixteenth before its fellow pace contestants
got called upon, retained command then steadily kicked clear. MAIDEN BEAUTY guided into the four path, went on to contest as the widest of a threesome
beginning from the half mile pole, was kept on reserve continuing at the task at hand as the trio heading for the quarter pole, stepped into the lane, ventured
onward for another sixteenth or so before asked for more, failed to keep pace, stayed on for second. CRITICAL VALUE pursued the front runners from the
two path, altered out four wide in midstretch, rallied for the show. TONED UP spotted along the inside route shortly after the start, began to get roused
beginning from the vicinity of the seven-sixteenths pole, cut the corner under a hard drive, flattened out. LOVE AND LOVE secured a prominent position,
shifted into the three path and went on to contest the pace from between rivals from the top of the turn until upper stretch, gave way. WICKED AMBER
loped along at the back of the pack, taking the two path on the bend, went onto the head of the stretch, improved position. SOUTH OF THE SHORE chased
the pace from path two, came under a drive springing from the five-sixteenths pole, got steered into the six path from upper to midlane, lacked the
necessary response. SAY MOI forwardly placed along the inside until late on the bend, faltered. FIFTYSHAYS OFGREEN pinched at the start, travelled
three wide on the turn, wandered out seven to eight wide in the stretch making no headway. I DARE U strung out four wide on the turn, tired.
