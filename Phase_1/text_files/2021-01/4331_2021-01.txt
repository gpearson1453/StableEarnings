Footnotes
FUEGO CALIENTE lagged well back for six furlongs, circled four wide rallying into the stretch, reached the front outside LEASE entering the final furlong
and won going away. LEASE saved ground allowed to settle early, moved out two then three wide approaching the stretch, overhauled FEAR THE BROW
from outside near the eighth-pole, but was no match for the winner soon after that. FEAR THE BROW was bumped lightly between horses at the start, set
the pace inside, and yielded through the furlong grounds. HE AIN'T NO SAINT raced three wide much of the way, improved position after six furlongs, but
flattened out late. WESTERLY WIND checked between horses first time through the stretch, saved ground to the far turn, and improved without threatening.
COLTONSTHEADMIRAL pressed FEAR THE BROW from outside, had aim approaching the stretch, but retreated under pressure. MR. EINSTEIN tired
inside after six furlongs. LIAMS STAR was reserved early two wide, and lacked a response when roused. EASTON ROCKS raced three to four wide
throughout, and tired. CITY GLORY broke two lengths slow, and was never close. JIMBO bumped with FEAR THE BROW at the start, and was outrun.
DEMON raced two wide, and was through after six furlongs.

Footnotes
FRIAR TUCK tracked the pace two wide, angled four wide nearing the quarter pole, steadily gained between rivals in the lane, took the lead near the
sixteenth pole, briefly drew clear and lasted under left-handed urging. SANDY DUDE saved ground off the pace and rallied along the rail through the stretch.
THIS DUDES NO FOOL checked back to last early, advanced four wide around the turn, angled further out in upper stretch and rallied widest. DIVERT
settled off the early pace outside, raced four wide around the turn, made progress in upper stretch but evened out late. BERHANU was off a bit slow,
advanced three wide, seized command near the quarter pole, quickly drew clear, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired in the final sixteenth. ON
THE ENGINE played no factor while racing two wide. CARROTS OR CARATS dueled two wide to upper stretch and tired. MILITARY DRILL dueled along
the rail for three furlongs and stopped.

Footnotes
LUDINGTON pressed the early pace inside, moved out to join the leaders two wide between horses on the turn, took over in upper stretch and drew clear
while drifting out. CAUSALISTIC was never far back, advanced widest of a foursome contesting the pace after a half-mile, and continued on willingly.
WICKSTERS DREAM pressed the pace from the outset, bid between horses three wide approaching the stretch, but weakened through the last eighth of a
mile. COUNTRY SINGER set the pace inside, faced a trio of challengers turning for home, and gave way. BOLD ENVOY was no factor two wide. BABY
BROTHER faded around the turn three then four wide.

BIMINI rated off the pace along the inside, split rivals in upper stretch, seized command near the eight pole and drew off under a drive. WORTH AVENUE
was squeezed back at the start, raced three and four wide around the turn and rallied widest to gain the place in the final strides. SALSA RITA stalked the
pace from the rail, bid in midstretch, battled on to the wire and was vanned off. SAY ADIOS set the pace two wide and weakened in the final furlong.
BAHAMIAN GIRL advanced four wide around the turn to reach contention turning for home and faded in the drive. BEAST OF WILDWOOD steadily faded
while racing three wide. I'M PRAYINGFORTHAT chased the pace three wide between foes and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
SIGILOSO was unhurried early inside, moved swiftly to contention four wide approaching the stretch, overpowered VOTER PROTECTION from outside
through the furlong grounds and edged clear, then held on late. TRIPLE JEOPARDY raced three wide for six furlongs, moved to the far outside for the drive
and finished fastest too late. DREAMING OF AUDREY was never far back, bid between horses in the two-path past the eighth-pole, and was outfinished.
VOTER PROTECTION pressed THE RED MAN from outside, wrested command coming to the quarter-pole, and gave way through the last eighth of a mile.
THE RED MAN set a manageable pace inside for nearly six furlongs, and yielded through the lane. QUINTO SOL was no factor two wide.

three-sixteenths marker and drew clear under a steady drive. VINNIE VAN GO tracked the pace three wide and was one-paced through the lane to hold
second. GAME BOY BENNY was in range inside, angled out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. STARSHIP APOLLO raced off the pace four wide and had
a mild gain outside. DECKOLOGY failed to menace while racing five wide. ROUGH ENTRY set the pace along the rail under pressure from the winner and
tired in the lane. ARRIVEDERLA was outrun inside.

Footnotes
MAIL ORDER took control right away, rated along inside to the top of the stretch, kicked clear through the furlong grounds, and was all out to hang on.
FOREVER BOSS saved ground to the far turn, moved out for the drive, loomed past the eighth-pole, got bumped by DANCE WITH DESTINY in deep
stretch and just missed. ELLE EST FORTE raced three wide much of the way, and finished gamely on the far outside. GABBY SQUARED cut the corner
rallying into the stretch, came out for room bumping DANCE WITH DESTINY into FOREVER BOSS with a sixteenth remaining, lost some momentum as a
result and was edged between horses. DANCE WITH DESTINY saved ground in range to the stretch, moved out to take a run at the pacesetter in upper
stretch, got bumped into FOREVER BOSS by GABBY SQUARED and took up sharply late. MIA AT MIDNIGHT raced wide throughout, and lacked the
needed closing bid. SPILL THE TEA was forwardly placed two wide to the stretch, and tired. BROKEN TABLE (IRE) was always outrun. BONNIE'S THE
BEST tracked outside the leaders three to four wide, and had nothing left in the stretch. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY, GABBY SQUARED WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH POSITION AND PLACED FIFTH FOR IMPEDING DANCE WITH DESTINY IN DEEP STRETCH. RUN-UP DISTANCE
UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
PHANTOM CURRENCY set the pace along the rail, drifted out a bit in the lane and held firm under a drive. DANCETERIA (FR) settled off the pace while
racing three wide, angled six wide in upper stretch, did not switch to the right lead until the eighth pole then closed outside. MONARCHS GLEN (GB) raced
off the pace four wide around the first turn, advanced four deep rounding the far turn and had a mild stretch rally. ARTIE'S RUMOR tracked the pace three
wide, bid nearing the lane but was one-paced through the stretch. PERFECT SPEIGHTY was rank under restraint early, saved ground up close and lacked
a rally. SAND DANCER chased the pace two wide and faded in the lane. IDENTIFIER raced off the pace inside, went three wide around the far turn, came
seven wide into the lane and never threatened. ENDORSED prompted the pace two wide and tired in the drive. RUN-UP DISTANCE UNAVAILABLE.

HERCULES saved ground in range to the turn, moved out three wide past the quarter-pole, wrested command outside SIDARTH past the furlong marker
and drove clear. SIDARTH set the pace inside, could not withstand the winner past the eighth-pole, and held well to remain well clear of the others.
HICKERSON bumped hard with FREEZE TURKEY at the start, saved ground outrun for six furlongs, and rallied along the rail for a share. GREYZER
pressed the pace three then two wide for six furlongs, and faded through the stretch. HANGAR ONE raced two to three wide, and did not seriously menace.
FITZ'S MO was finished around the turn while moving out four wide. FREEZE TURKEY bumped hard knocking heads with HICKERSON at the break, and
tired before reaching the stretch. THE METHOD showed speed outside to the turn, and faltered after a half-mile.
