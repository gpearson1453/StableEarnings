Footnotes
COMPLEX SYSTEM was coaxed to establish early position after being last of the quartet to commence, moved out while taken in hand behind the leaders
at the nine-sixteenths, dropped back under a snug hold while floating into the three path into the turn then quickly dropped to the two path, drafted behind
the leading duo under a hold, was patiently ridden while waiting behind those foes into upper stretch, moved out from behind the leaders at the
three-sixteenths while asked, accelerated to make an outside bid into the final furlong, gained the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best
under strong handling. BREW CREW showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail while inside of a foe on the turn,
was asked at the top of the stretch, lost the lead under the whip at the three-sixteenths, fought on well in the final sixteenth and earned the place while
unable to match strides with the winner late. SCHMOOZIN pressed the pace on the outside while in hand, was let out in the three path on the turn then
roused for more outside the quarter-pole, took a short lead in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole, battled between
foes into the final sixteenth and just missed the place while extremely clear for third. F J'S GEM settled outside under some urging, dropped from the three
path to the two path while ridden along on the turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
HILTON MAGIC showed good speed and moved clear early, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, responded well when asked at the
three-sixteenths, drew off under a drive into the final forty yards then was eased up while much the best. ABOUT OUR TIME was away alertly then chased
the pace down the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into upper stretch and proved no match while clear
for the place. WESTERN TROUBLE bobbled after the start, was taken back under restraint, moved out leaving the backstretch, went three wide while
roused on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch, moved out outside the sixteenth-pole and just got up for the show. SIR TRUEBADOUR chased the pace
on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a left-handed whip, drifted out at the three-sixteenths, was switched to a
right-handed whip coming to the furlong marker and tired then lost the show. LITTLE KANSAS broke in at the start then dropped back, went around the turn
in the two path, moved out a bit in upper stretch and failed to threaten. THE GRAY BLUR broke out at the start, was urged along off the pace, moved from
three wide to the rail early on the turn while dropping back and had nothing left. XY SPEED was coaxed along on the outside, dropped back while moving
from the four path to the two path early on the turn and retreated.
