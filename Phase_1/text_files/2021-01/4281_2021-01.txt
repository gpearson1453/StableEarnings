HOLLY GO LIGHTLY unhurried while never far back, rallied in the stetch, forged to lead and cleared off smartly. VORTICES raced back to the stretch,
uncorked a wide run for place late. REDHOT KATIE had an inside trip, stayed well in the drive to gamely hold the show spot. FLAT MEADOW tracked three
wide to turn, led past quarter pole but faltered late. SHE'S NO DRAMA had an awkward start, dueled to late stretch and faltered in the drive. DICHOTOMY
loomed boldly to the quarter pole while well off rail with nothing left in drive. THE TWO NANCY'S raced in good position to the stretch, failed to respond late.
HARDLY MATE was off slow and never recovered. TIZ RED WINE rushed to lead, inside to the turn, gave way readily in the stretch run

Footnotes
DESTINIQUE just off leaders to turn, challenged into stretch and edged clear late. ARTIE'S ROSE awkward start and bounced around, recovered with a
good late run for place in the final sixteenth. THREATLEVELMIDNITE (GB) sharp speed to gallop to the lead, stayed on well for show spot at the wire.
OVERDRESSED chased three wide to quarter pole, stayed on gamely in the drive. EUROPA raced in second flight to turn, evenly from the turn.
AMERICAN VIOLET no speed to the turn and only improved position off rail in the stretch. A LOT OF SPUNK just off leader to quarter pole could not go on
and faltered. DARK BLUE FLAME never a menace. SILVER MAPLE bothered at the start and lost best chance and never a threat thereafter. JASMINE
CHIEFTAIN never a menace outside. TIZ THIRSTY was through after the half from outside and retreated. MOONSHINE DANCING was off slow inside,
rushed up rail but used up and dropped back.
