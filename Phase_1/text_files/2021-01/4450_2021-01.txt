Footnotes
SEEDS OF TIME unhurried in the early going while four wide through the first turn, began a steady advance after five furlongs off the inside, challenged
three wide turning for home, drove well clear to prove best. DIXIE MO pressed the issue off the inside through the first turn, fell back a bit the middle half,
closer between rivals and inside the winner turning for home, fell back again for the second spot past the furlong marker, firmly roused, came back for that
position while not a threat to the winner. RAHWAY broke alertly, set the pace inside, offered brief resistance to the winner entering the stretch, chased that
one past the furlong marker while clear for the second spot, weakened late to be nipped for that position at the wire. ANGELINA'S HEAVEN settled off the
pace and the inside, continued one paced while four wide into the lane, lacked a closing response. HUSH Y'ALL made little impact while saving ground
much of the way, came three wide for the drive, no serious kick. GLAMORIZED void of speed, passed tiring rivals while also not a serious threat. LADY
MCKENZIE prompted the pace off the inside and three wide, gave way. BOSSY BRIDE was finished after a half.

Footnotes
WILLFUL WOMAN tracked the leader along the inside, moved out to be three wide when moving to challenge turning for home, took over, drifted out, well
clear. SMARMY carried out at the start, pressed the leader off the inside, took over in the far turn, offered brief resistance to the winner in upper stretch then
proved no match late, remained clear for the place. TRUMPET LILLY behind the leaders toward the inside, came three wide into the stretch, displayed
some mild late interest to be gaining on the runner up. ZAPPORITA carried out a bit at the start, raced within striking distance while 4w through the first turn,
crept a bit closer late in the final turn, flattened out in the drive, missed the show. LOFTHOUSE broke in good order, set the pace toward the inside, faltered
when headed by the runner up in the second turn. MEJTHAAM broke out to carry a couple of rivals out, failed to menace. EASY SILENCE last away, trailed
throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
DON'T FORGET off a step sloe, raced back, was steered to to be five wide with rallying late in the turn, collared the leaders past the furlong marker and
drove steadily clear. REASON TO SOAR prompted the pace off the inside, challenged the leader entering the stretch, vied between foes past the furlong
marker when on equal terms with the winner, could not match that one late, clearly second best. MIDNIGHT LAS VEGAS settled in the two path behind the
pace, roused for the drive, proved no match for the top two, fully extended to prevail for the show late. LOOPALLU away in good order, stalked the pace
while racing three wide, came up empty when asked the final furlong. SCRUTINIZER rank, steadied at the start, trailed for a half, moved out and was four
wide turning for home, found best stride too late to improve position while well out in the strip. . HURTS SO GOOD broke alertly, cleared to the inside to set
the pace, continued to show the way into the lane, faltered when headed nearing the furlong marker. DRC ALL INCLUSIVE failed to menace while three
wide. RULER OF THE NILE was finished early. ROYAL COMMISSION tired while racing along the inside.

for room to be three wide for the drive, set down, finished well to be getting to the winner late. NILES CHANNEL broke back, bothered in some traffic early,
rallied three wide into the lane, closed some ground to be up late for the show while remaining out in the strip. STONE SECRET vied up front while between
rivals, weakened in the drive. COLD AS HELL went one paced while racing three wide. BATTLE HERO broke alertly, contested the pace closest to the
inside, gave way in the drive. HANEY BOYS raced in mid pack outside, came four wide out of the turn, lacked the needed closing response. AXIS failed to
menace. SPECIAL PRYCE chased the leaders early, was finished before a half. FACTION off a step slow, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HIDDEN SCROLL back off the pace steadied in traffic entering the stretch, moved out, four then five wide into the lane, challenged outside the first flight
past the furlong marker, drove comfortably clear. ROYAL DAAHER in tight at the start, moved up along the inside, checked in tight quarters along the rail
into the turn, recovered to saved some ground inside of traffic through the bend, came in the two path for the drive, finished with courage to be up for the
place, not a real threat to the winner. ANCIENT WARRIOR settled in mid pack outside, four wide through the turn when advancing, challenged inside the
winner into the lane, hung the final furlong to be outkicked for the place, saved the show. LYKAN void of speed toward the inside for three furlongs, angled
out steadily to be five wide turning for home, mild rally to improve position. AMERICAN BUTTERFLY void of speed for a half, steered out to be four wide
turni9ng for home, improved position while narrowly missing the fourth spot. HANSENS MISCHIEF forwardly placed on the outside, bit closer while four
wide into the turn, weakened in the drive. ENERGIZER pinched back at the break, trailed early as a result, came three wide for the drive, displayed some
late interest to improve position. DESTINY WAY forwardly placed while racing three wide, had little left for the drive. SOUIXPER CHARGER alternated up
front closest to the inside for a half, gave way through the stretch. REEF'S DESTINY saved ground to no avail. SKOL FACTOR broke alertly, settled behind
the pace in the two path, three wide into the lane, faded. STURGILL dueled up front off the inside, stopped badly to finish far back.

ABROGATE close from the start off the inside, advanced to challenge between horses through the turn, narrowly showed the way into the land, edging
away late while fully extended with a right handed whip. SOUTHERN GRAYCE within striking distance outside early, vied three wide and outside the winner
late in the turn, could no match strides with that one the final sixteenth, held sway for the place. INJECT in the second flight early toward the inside, crept a
bit closer late in the turn while remaining along the inside, moved out for the drive, modest interest, finished up best of the rest, no real threat for the place.
EKATI'S HIT broke a step slow, moved up to race within striking distance outside, four wide through the turn, came up empty for the drive to finish up
evenly. ABSOLUTE ANNA remained back in failing to menace. MELTING SNOW broke alertly, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch, vied along the
rail through the turn then gave way in the drive. MY BOSS LADY broke out and slowly, trailed throughout in failing to threaten.

LNGTERMRELATIONSHP lacked speed while saving some ground in the first turn, moved out onto the backstretch, worked way out to be four wide when
rallying into the lane, finished with good energy to be up in time. TRUCULENT broke alertly, showed the way into the first turn off the inside, continued in the
two path up the backstretch when on a lonesome lead, remained well clear into the lane, failed to contain the winner late, remained well clear for the place.
TRASHTALKINYANKEE settled off the pace while four wide into the first turn, continued back, two path through much of the second bend, staged a mild
rally to annex the show, no threat to the top pair. SOLOMONIC bothered to be off slowly, raced back while saving ground, mild advance when moved out in
the two path late in the final turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. STOCK DEAL off a step slow, raced back while four wide through the
first turn, continued outside, three out to four wide again in the second bend, when improving a bit, finished up evenly. HANDY within striking distance while
saving ground, came up empty for the drive. FEVOLA prompted the pace off the inside, lodged a brief bid outside the runner up in the second turn, faltered
in the drive. TAKE CHARGE NOW within striking distance, backed up in the stretch. ROBINSON void of speed, steadied into the far turn when trailing,
continued back in the run to the wire. RIVER FINN settled in mid pack, began a steady fade after a half.
