Footnotes
LADY BREANNA was urged to the lead racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin a bit off the rail through the backstretch, met the
challenge of a rival to her inside to regain a clear advantage nearing midstretch and widened late under firm encouragement. NIGHT WATCH was rated
along the rail stalking just off the pacesetter under firm reserve in the opening half mile, was prompted to advance inside the leader pressing the issue on
the far turn, couldn't match terms with that foe racing into upper stretch, then switched out in the closing stages while proving best of the others.
ROYALBONNIELEGACY tracked just off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch and continued with an effort to gain some position three
wide racing into the lane. QUIET NO MORE settled last racing to the backstretch, then angled out four wide racing into the stretch while making no real
impression. ANTALYA tracked just off the second flight between foes racing to the far turn and steadily faded into the lane. J'S TWOSTEP BEAUTY broke
readily, prompted the pacesetter to the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
DREAMS STILL WILD broke readily, vied outside a rival, then three wide through the backstretch disputing the lead, edged forward to a narrow advantage
entering the bend while shifting nearer to the inside, resisted several challengers racing into the lane and held sway to the end under firm right handed
encouragement. PEACEFUL WAY jostled at the start, gained position three deep between foes in the second flight racing through the backstretch, shifted
out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors while her rider took his mount in hand approaching the
wire. BLAZING MISS JOJO, urged inside the eventual winner, then between foes prompting the pace through the backstretch, lost some ground to the
leader entering the turn, shifted to the inside racing into upper stretch and just missed for second while failing to regain even terms with the winner. LITTLE
MISS HODOR tracked off the first flight four wide racing to the turn, shifted in to prompt the winner three deep on the bend but flattened out in upper stretch.
HIDEY HIDEY, bumped at the start, settled off the second flight while angling to the inside early and never gained contention. DANCIN AT THE RITZ broke
outwards bumping PEACEFUL WAY, was righted, then urged to contention angling inside the leaders leaving the chute, was prompted to briefly press the
pace inside foes on the backstretch but came up empty on the turn. MAY BEAU settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
QUICK ENTRY broke readily, pressed the pace between foes through the backstretch, continued three deep into the lane dueling for command and edged
forward late under firm handling to prevail. MAGICAL TALE, urged inside foes pressing the pace on a narrow advantage shifting a bit off the rail, dueled for
command between foes on the turn past midstretch and was just outkicked. HARD WEST swerved out at the start bumping I'M MACHEN TOO, was
collected off that foe, then angled to the rail taking up a position just behind the leaders, came through inside foes when presented an opening midway
through the turn to bid for command nearing upper stretch, contested the issue in a protracted skirmish past midstretch but was outkicked by the top pair.
PURIMETER was eased back avoiding close quarters in the opening stages to track off the first flight, was prompted to split rivals three deep nearing the
lane and continued with a steady effort to gain position to the end. DOUBLE DEEP, urged three wide between foes through the backstretch pressing the
pace, lost ground to the leaders entering the bend and gave way nearing the lane. I'M MACHEN TOO, bumped start, was quickly righted then shifted
inwards to join the pace four wide, was prompted to contend in that path into the turn and gave way after a half. ELUSIVE RO settled last outside foes
racing to the turn, was eased entering the lane while being quickly outdistanced, then was vanned off the course following the race.

Footnotes
HONESTA came through close quarters racing to the first turn to track off the first flight between foes under rating into the backstretch, shifted to the inside
nearing midstretch to bid along the rail in the closing stages and narrowly prevailed in time under firm encouragement. TENERIFE MOON settled outside
foes dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide nearing upper stretch, shifted inwards under pressure
racing past midstretch while advancing to challenge for command and was just outkicked. MADAME MOON, urged through the close quarters racing to the
first turn to gain the lead racing a bit off the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, held sway into upper stretch and disputed the issue
grudgingly between foes to the end while collared late. HIGHRHYTHMDIXIE urged three deep between foes to gain terms with the leader prompting the
pace, pressed the issue between foes to upper stretch shifting outwards while his rider appeared to strike NEW YORK COMMANDER with his whip
midstretch and gave way late. NEW YORK COMMANDER tracked just outside the first flight racing four deep to the backstretch, advanced three deep
nearing upper stretch but lost her momentum when appearing to be struck across the nose by a rival's whip leaving midstretch. MERICATHEBEAUTIFUL
tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid. KATIE FALOONA settled in the last flight near the
inside and trailed the field to the stretch. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF NEW YORK COMMANDER LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST
THE RIDER OF HIGHRHYTHMDIXIE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
STARSHIP GODDESS was rated inside rivals as part of the second flight tracking the pacesetter from out of striking distance to the backstretch, switched
out three deep nearing upper stretch, steadily advanced in that path midstretch, shifted in under pressure, then altered course avoiding BIG ANNIE in late
stages but sustained her momentum to prevail in time under firm handling. BIG ANNIE tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the first turn,
shifted out four wide after a half while being prompted to advance, steadily closed the gap on the pacesetter racing into the stretch, shifted about avoiding
close quarters, then into the path of the eventual winner in the closing stages and just missed. CANTERBURY GOLD sped clear of the field along the inside
racing to the backstretch, held sway on a comfortable advantage into the lane, shifted out under pressure while being roused to resist the top pair but was
collared nearing the wire. GET BACK HOME, off a bit slowly, settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled out five wide midway
through the backstretch, advanced four wide on the far turn to upper stretch but had no final bid. A FOOLISH FANCY angled inwards while avoiding some
traffic racing into the first turn to track between rivals in second flight racing to the far turn but had no closing bid. JAENT, off slowly, was settled last along
the inside and passed some tiring rivals into the lane. CLOVER BEACH settled inside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to mount a serious challenge.
MARIANNA QUEEN tracked off the second flight along the inside but faded early. PALOMA MIA swerved out leaving the chute while being prompted to
contend exchanging repeated contact with PASTURE PRINCESS racing into the first turn, was urged in pursuit of the pacesetter into the backstretch and
gave way between foes racing through the far turn. PASTURE PRINCESS shifted inwards being urged to contend leaving the chute, exchanged several
bumps with PALOMA MIA racing into the first turn and dropped out after a half.

tandem with several rivals, shifted inwards disputing the issue outside a rival to midstretch and edged forward late under energetic handling. LARGE tracked
off the first flight nearest the inside in the opening stages, switched out to advance in close quarters between foes racing into the turn, dueled inside foes
into upper stretch but came up second best. SOARING BIRD raced unhurried five deep between foes in the opening stages, was prompted to advance four
deep between foes while caught in close quarters challenging for command racing into the turn and couldn't match the top pair in the last furlong. ACTION

path entering the turn while exchanging some contact racing in tight quarters midway through the bend and faded into upper stretch. FRONTIER MESA,
urged along the inside disputing the pace inside a rival, dueled for command inside the field racing into the turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. WEST

Footnotes
CLASSY OF COURSE broke readily to gain a forward placing between foes attending the pace under light rating racing to the backstretch, steadily moved
to terms with the leader entering the far turn, pressed the issue nearing upper stretch to edge clear in the lane and held SAND DRIFT on a safe margin
under firm handling. The latter tracked off the first flight outside foes leaving the chute, angled inwards entering the first turn to track those rivals between
foes, shifted to the inside entering the far turn continuing under patient handling, switched off the inside entering the lane to split rivals leaving midstretch
and continued willingly just outside the winner to close the gap. BLOODY MARY MORNIN was rated off the first flight near the inside racing to the
backstretch, shifted out to advance four wide between foes in the closing stages and continued willingly while being just outkicked for second. OVER TO
YOU tracked off the first flight outside foes racing into the backstretch, steadily gained position three wide entering the far turn, was fanned five wide into
upper stretch and lacked the needed final kick. RED CURLS, caught three, then four wide tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, continued
four wide on the far turn to the lane and had no closing bid. ELUSIVE RYDER settled in the last flight early, switched outside foes on the backstretch but
offered no rally. WANNA HAVE FUN settled between foes in early stages, angled to the inside on the backstretch but offered no rally. MORGAN'S Z VA,
urged along the rail to gain a forward placing, wrested the advanteg dictating the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, dueled inside the eventual
winner leaving the far turn and gave way midstretch. HOLY DIVER, urged to terms with the leaders three deep prompting the pace into the backstretch,
gave way abruptly between foes nearing the second bend while being steadied out of close quarters.

Footnotes
ZOOMIES, off last, was settled along the inside racing through the backstretch, switched outside foes gathering some momentum entering the turn, swung
out five wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to rally past rivals in time under left handed pressure. RAL
COPPERHEADROAD, off a bit slowly, tracked off the first flight four wide racing to the turn, shifted inwards to advance three wide into the lane challenging
for command in late stages but was outkicked. HAIL SOUTHERN shifted in at the start crossing the path of GRAB THE CHANCE, was righted quickly to
gain terms with the pacesetter prompting that foe through the backstretch, took over from that foe racing through the turn, went clear into upper stretch while
shifting to the inside but failed to sustain that momentum through the final sixteenth. T J MUNNINGS tracked off the second flight outside rivals, shifted out
four wide nearing the lane but had no rally. GRAB THE CHANCE, caught in tight quarters at the start, recovered to track off the first flight near the inside,
switched out approaching the turn while being urged to advance between foes but had no closing bid. TIZ TRIUMPHANT tracked the leaders between foes
in second flight on the backstretch but faded early. ATWATER, urged along the rail disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way after
a half. HERE FOR BEER dropped out early.

Footnotes
LEXOPHILIA was rated off the first flight outside a rival racing to the first turn, switched outside foes on the backstretch to gain terms with the pacesetter
after a half, pressed the issue outside that rival on the far turn into upper stretch and edged forward to a narrow advantage in a protracted skirmish to prevail
under brisk handling. FREEDOM MACHINE was settled outside foes racing to the first turn, angled inwards nearing the backstretch to gain some position
between foes after half, angled out four wide in upper stretch and produced a steady late response to just miss. DREAMING OF PARIS broke readily, sped
to the lead along the rail racing to the backstretch, dueled for command inside the eventual winner on the far turn into the stretch contesting the issue
grudgingly to late stages but yielded while prevailing for a share as her rider took his mount in hand approaching the wire. MOMS LOVE was rated off the
second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, switched out after a half to gain terms with a rival in second flight, shifted out three wide racing
through the stretch while being urged to advance on the leaders but was outkicked. V K LEGACY, urged to a forward placing three wide racing to the
backstretch, shifted inside the pacesetter to track the leaders into the far turn but had no closing bid. LADY CLOVERLY tracked off the second flight outside
foes, angled four wide into the lane but had no rally. PLATINUMCENTS broke in the air, was settled between foes in the last flight, then was fanned five
wide in the closing stages while proving no threat. INHONOROFOWENJR urged between foes prompting the pace to the backstretch, gave way early.
WELLINGTONS ROSE tracked off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch and faded after a half. LADY MIAH settled last and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BRICE, urged clear along the inside racing to the first turn, shifted off the rail on the backstretch dictating the pace on a comfortable advantage, went well
clear while shifting out entering the lane and widened the advantage under firm left handed pressure. SUN SQUALL, unhurried between foes dropping off
the second flight racing to the first turn, shifted out four wide on the backstretch, angled inwards racing into the far turn splitting rivals gaining position into
the stretch but was always only second best. WICKED STRONG ALEX angled inwards racing into the first turn to track the leaders between foes in second
flight, shifted in saving ground on the far turn but had no closing bid while prevailing for a share. DOHKO, reserved between foes racing to the backstretch,
shifted to the inside saving ground on the far turn and continued with some interest to improve position. TALON switched off the inside early tracking the
leaders three wide in second flight but steadily faded into the far turn. PAPA RALPH J switched off the rail racing into the first turn while being urged in
pursuit of the pacesetter, then gave way racing into the far turn. SUPER EDGAR, caught four wide racing to the backstretch, never seriously menaced.
IRISH MAIL, caught wide racing to the backstretch, failed to menace. ZAMAN settled inside rivals in the last flight and proved no factor. EL GRAN CACAO
angled to the inside early tracking the leaders in second flight but retreated after a half.
