MUCHO MACHO EDDIE was never far back between horses, moved two wide to vie before a half, bore out under left hand whip in midstream and edged
clear. OCTORARO ORPHIE came out three wide on the turn while moving, vied outside the winner into the final furlong but flattened out. SPLITZVILLE was
unhurried after a slow break, raced the three path around the turn, lugged in in early stretch and gained late between horses. STRAWBERRY RED opened
a clear lead soon after the break, stayed along the rail while making the pace for about a half then tired. MANAHAWKIN was slow early then made a mild
run between horses. SACRED MOUNTAIN stayed inside around the turn, came out between horses in the lane but wasn't a factor. START CASHIN
showed speed, moved three wide to a short lead early on the turn, drifted nearing the lane and faded. CHRISATUDE was fractious in the gate, took to the
outside early on the backstretch and was eased up late while outrun. ROLLING PALISADES was finished early then was eased up through the final quarter.

rallied five wide around the turn, vied outside into the final furlong but couldn't stay with the winner. EMILIA STRONG was bumped leaving the gate then
made a late run between rivals. RELEASE ME rallied to vie four wide between rivals on the turn then tired in the lane. SHOW MAID was slow early then
made a late run along the rail. RIP BY YOU sped to the front at once, angled to the inside and tired in the lane. JEANNE'S JOY chased, gave her best three
wide between rivals on the turn then stopped. SPICY CURRY stopped inside. CHECKING THE MARK ducked into EMILIA STRONG leaving the gate then
was outrun. CYBERSPACE was outrun.
