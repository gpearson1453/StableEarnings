Footnotes
LOOKIN SO LUCKY forwardly placed outside the leader, bid three wide at the top of the lane, gained command at the eighth pole, dueled with ACOUSTIC
SHADOW in the final furlong and prevailed. ACOUSTIC SHADOW went four wide into the first turn then angled to the two path around the bend, angled
back out four wide leaving the far turn, bid outside the top pair in upper stretch, dueled with the winner late and was bested. UNBREAKABLE settled along
the inside, angled out around the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, rallied and proved a game third. AMIKO CHOW (IRE) chased from off the pace
early on, went outside a rival on the backstretch, traveled two then three wide around the far turn, showed late effort but was outkicked by the trop trio.
LET'S GO NOW stumbled at the start, recovered well to head to the front, cleared the field and set the pace from inside, showed the way in the two path
entering the stretch, relinquished command at the eighth pole and flattened out. OLIVE YOU MORE stalked the pace from inside, roused around the second
bend, cut the corner into the stretch, was in tight and waited briefly upper stretch, tipped out and could not rally late. NICOLE GRACE reserved in the
beginning, saved ground throughout and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SIGNOFTHECROSS stalked outside the top pair, bid three wide at the quarter pole, gained command just past the eighth pole and drew clear in the final
sixteenth. CAUSEIDIDITMYWAY dueled outside a rival to the far turn, inched ahead around that bend, met outside bid from SIGNOFTHECROSS at the
quarter pole, fought back along the inside, yielded in the final sixteenth and held the place. ALVAARO rated early along the inside then moved into the two
path, entered the stretch three wide, tipped out in the lane, finished willingly but needed to find more in deep stretch. POLAR WIND chased off the inside,
came off the final turn four wide and improved position. STACKIN SILVER dueled for the lead from inside, ridden along through the second bend, could not
keep pace into the lane and weakened. SKY CONFIDENTIAL stumbled at the start, saved ground to the stretch and proved no menace.

Footnotes
BANG FOR YOUR BUCK settled early, steadied behind rival at the three-eighths, angled five wide into the stretch, closed fast and inhaled the runner-up in
the closing moments. BEAUDACIOUS broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, chased four deep then outside the leader, took over in upper stretch,
kicked clear of inside foe then got caught in the final strides. FAT STACKS steadied early, drifted out at the three-eighths pole, went four wide into the
stretch, five wide at the top of the lane and held the show. LUVLUV steadied early, traveled along the inside into the stretch, shifted out and bumped rival
repeatedly near the eighth pole and went on to miss the show. SQUARED STRAIGHT chased between rivals, two wide into the stretch, between rivals
again in the drive and lacked the needed late kick. LIL RICHARDS BELLO forwardly placed outside a pair of rivals, went four wide upper stretch then
between foes and weakened in the late stages. MR. CLUTCH checked early, raced along the inside into the stretch, angled out in the drive but failed to
rally. ARRIVEDERCI ROMA sped to the front, crossed over to the inside, held command through the turn, lost the lead at the top of the lane and tired.
AUGUST INDY bumped and checked leaving the gate, lagged behind and was never a factor. ZERO DOWN stalked along the inside then a bit off the rail in
upper stretch, bumped repeatedly by rival and checked at the eighth pole and faded. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED
LUVLUV FROM FOURTH TO LAST FOR ALTERING OUT AND CAUSING ZERO DOWN TO CHECK APPROACHING THE EIGHTH POLE, COSTING
ZERO DOWN A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

CONCERT TOUR pressed the leader early before taking over at the half-mile pole, remained under a confident ride into the stretch, roused inside the eighth
pole and drew away in hand late. MR. IMPOSSIBLE chased outside rival, closed in on the leader around the turn, took aim three wide into the stretch, could
not threaten the winner in the final furlong but was clearly second best. TARVI off a bit slow to begin, stalked inside to the turn, angled out around the bend
and came three wide into the stretch and bested the rest. HOZIER broke in, chased off the rail, three wide into the turn, two wide into the stretch and
weakened. SENSEMAKER set the pace early with CONCERT TOUR to the outside, lost the lead at the half-mile pole, chased that foe into the turn, lost
ground around the bend and faded.

SAPPHIRE KID stumbled a bit at the start, settled behind the field, raced two to three wide into the stretch, angled out and rallied under left-handed urging
and won going away under hand urging late. MISCHIFFIE (IRE) stalked the pace from inside, saved ground around the turn, moved out a bit and went
between foes in upper stretch and finished well to earn the place honors. POSIT sped to the front then dueled with DEVILS DANCE up the backstretch, held
a short lead through the turn, cleared rival in upper stretch, got caught at the sixteenth pole and edged for second late. SAVVY GAL stalked outside a rival
or two wide into the turn, tipped out at the top of the drive and flattened out in the final furlong. DEVILS DANCE shifted in at the start, sent for the lead and
forced the early pace from inside, continued to apply pressure through the turn, could not keep pace with the leader into the stretch and weakened in the
final furlong.

GOTTA BE LUCKY forwardly placed early behind the top pair, went three to four wide around the second turn while being asked, collared the leader inside
the eighth pole, gained control with a sixteenth to go and drew clear late. OUR BONNIE LASS dueled for the lead outside a rival, vied three deep briefly at
the half-mile pole, dueled with KEEP DANCING into and around the far turn, cleared rival near the quarter pole, challenged by GOTTA BE LUCKY in the
drive, could not hold off the winner but finished a clear second. MOREAVINO settled off the inside, exited the far turn three wide and gained the show.
KEEP DANCING fractious in the gate, off slow at the start, stalked from inside then went up inside to challenge at the halfway point, dueled with OUR
BONNIE LASS into and around the far turn, chased that rival past the quarter pole and weakened in the late stages. BLAZINONBAYOU bumped at the
start, trailed up the backstretch from off the rail, angled out upper stretch and had little left. NAANSENSE dueled for the lead from inside early, vied between
foes briefly at the half-mile pole then chased the top pair to the far turn, went two wide around that bend and faded. KEEP IT CLASSY broke out out and
bumped rival leaving the gate, chased outside a foe and remained off the rail into the lane, eased through the drive and walked off.

Footnotes
SOMBEYAY sped to the front, set the pace under pressure, headed by rival at the five-sixteenths pole, held the challenger at bay in the drive then drew
clear in the final sixteenth under right-handed urging. TIZ PLUS shifted out and bumped rival entering the first turn, pulled from inside and had the rider lose
the whip on that bend, stalked the leader up the backstretch, remained inside to the lane, angled out and finished well to earn the place. OHIO (BRZ)
pressed the pace from outside, headed rival at the five-sixteenths pole, challenged in the drive but faltered in deep stretch. THE BLACK ALBUM (FR)
bumped by TIZ PLUS entering the first turn, stalked the speed outside a rival or two wide to the stretch, angled out and lacked a bid. MUSAWAAT (GB)
traveled near the inside, angled out on the second turn, exited the far turn three wide, moved out further in upper stretch and could not rally. MANHATTAN
UP steadied early, altered out into the first turn, tracked off the inside, three then two wide around the final bend and weakened.

Footnotes
SHANE ZAIN went four wide around the first turn, moved up to press three deep, gained the lead at the five-sixteenths pole, vied three wide into the stretch,
maintained a short lead over SIX POINT RACK through the final furlong and held gamely to the wire. SIX POINT RACK went four to five wide around the
first turn, three to four wide around the second, bid four deep into the stretch, challenged SHANE ZAIN in the final furlong but lacked the needed final kick to
get by. MAXINAMILLION stalked the pace from inside then a bit off the rail into the stretch, lacked room behind rivals at the top of the lane, steered outside
and finished willingly for the show. OCEAN FURY dueled for the lead from inside early then pressed the leader on the backstretch, chased inside to the
stretch and kept on for a minor award. BLAME IT ON KITTY lagged behind early, advanced along the inside around the far turn, angled out into the stretch
and moved out further in the drive and finished summoned a mild rally. VODKA TWIST was up close behind the leaders in the two path, angled four wide
leaving the far turn and flattened out. DEBT MONGER traveled three to four wide around the first turn, chased outside a rival then three deep on the
backstretch, went four wide around the far turn and could not rally. GRYFFINDOR deled outside OCEAN FURY early, vied between or inside a rival on the
backstretch, two wide into the drive and folded. R CHA CHA came in and bumped rival at the start, chased three wide around the first turn, entered the far
turn three wide then angled five wide into the stretch and weakened. WILL DANCER bumped outside rival and got shuffled back at the start, pulled early
and steadied into the first turn, continued to pulled around that bend then tracked off the inside, raced four then three wide on the far turn, had nothing left
for the stretch, eased in the lane and walked off. BITTER RING HOME bumped and checked at the start, went five wide around both turns, came up empty
in the stretch and was eased to the wire and walked off. RIDEO chased in the two path, tired in the stretch, was eased and walked off.
