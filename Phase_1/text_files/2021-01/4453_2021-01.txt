behind the leader, saved ground, followed the winner to the wire and was a clear second. SUMMERTIME BANDIT stumbled at the start, racing in the back,
moved up on the outside around the turn and gained ground. QUICK HEAT raced within striking distance, was outfinished for third and put forth an even
effort. HERE COMES LINDA void of early speed and passed tired ones. CRAPAUD lacked early speed and was never close. RARE ONE pressed the early
pace and faded. WHY NOT DANA raced near the back and was outrun. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
HANGING LAKE lacked early speed, racing in the rear, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a wide rally and got up in time. GUILTY
CONFESSION dueled for the early lead, saved ground, took the advantage and was caught at the wire. I'M ALL MIXED UP bumped start, pressed the early
pace, raced three wide around the turn and was outfinished by the top two. RAISING THE ROOF raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout, put
forth a good effort, but lacked a late kick. ROSE CROWN lacked early speed, made a mild bid, but was no factor. BIGJIM'S SILVERGAL showed early
speed and was finished early. ARANCIA raced near the middle of the field and faded. SHE'S A FAIR CATCH bumped at the start, raced near the back in
the beginning and was never close. ALYS EPISODE pressed the early pace, saved ground around the turn and dropped back. SARA'S FLASH void of early
speed and showed little.

the middle of the field, made a late mild bid and was a clear third. ENOUGH HEART showed early speed, raced close throughout, saved ground and
weakened. TOSHITA FOREVER raced in the back of the pack, improved position, but was no factor. SEVEN COME ELEVEN lacked early speed, raced

got up for third, but proved no match for the top two. HARLONS COMMISION bumped at the start , raced near the back, moved up and finished evenly.
POOPSIE DOOPSIE bumped and shuffled back at the start, improved position, but was no factor. LADY BELACQUA vied for the early lead, saved ground

Footnotes
LENAPE DRIVE raced within contention, down the backside, moved up around the turn and pulled away down the stretch. SHANGHAI MIKE raced within
striking distance, came around the turn four wide, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. MY PERFECT GRAYDAR went to the front,
drove clear and weakened. D'ROCK broke a step slow, racing in the rear, made a late gain and was outfinished for third. YOUNG HENDRICK pressed the
early pace, forwardly placed throughout and weakened down the stretch. SMARTY GRIMES void of early speed, moved up, but was no factor. BAPTISM
dueled for the early lead and faded. BRAZOSWILDCAT always raced near the back and showed little. HAUS raced within contention and dropped back.

Footnotes
PARLAY PETE broke thru the gates before the start, reloaded, sprinted to the front, led throughout and finished well. BROOK IS GOLDEN broke slow,
racing in the back, made a steady gain and finished willingly. RAMAAH raced within striking distance, made a mild bid, but proved no match for the top two.
EGOMANIAC lacked early speed, made a late gain and was outfinished for show. ELLA'S ACTOR pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout and
weakened. OUACHITA raced in the middle of the pack, came around the final turn six wide and finished evenly. ROYAL GALAXY void of early speed,
improved position, but was no factor. IT'SUPTOYOUPAL raced within contention and dropped back. LUCKY STREAKER void of early speed and was
outrun. BRAVE RIFLE challenged for the early lead, saved ground and retreated.
