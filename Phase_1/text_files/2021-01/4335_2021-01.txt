the early pace along the rail, dueled on even terms through the lane but wasn't quite enough. DIGGERS DIAMOND settled early, improved position two
wide into the stretch then continued evenly. DEFIBRILLATOR had early position inside, came out three wide nearing the stretch then flattened out.
OCTORARO ORPHIE was bumped just after the break, stayed inside and failed to menace. MISSION OBERON was bumped into OCTORARO ORPHIE
leaving the gate then was bumped again early on the backstretch, took to the outside, made a three wide run on the turn then tired. BOLD QUEST ducked
into MISSION OBERON leaving the gate and again early on the backstretch, raced wide around the turn and trailed.

Footnotes
FAIRY DUST moved to the front from the outside just before going a quarter, drew out two wide early on the turn, remained clear for about five furlongs then
held stubbornly. KEW PALACE stayed inside, bid inside the winner into the final sixteenth and hung. JESSE THE GREAT was slow early, made a run three
wide
around
the
turn
and
finished
willingly
between
rivals.
BROOKLYNS
SURPRISE
chased
three
wide
to
the
stretch
then
weakened.
TOOTSYSROCKNROLLER made a run four wide around the turn but lacked a strong closing response. LIKEUONLYPRETTIER lagged inside to the stretch
then found best stride too late. SECRET MUSIC ducked out into STORMY SPELL soon after the break then was no factor. STORMY SPELL ducked out
into DISCREETLY TOUGH leaving the gate, was bumped soon after, raced four wide and failed to menace. CABBAGE PATCH broke sharply, made the
early pace along the rail and stopped. DISCREETLY TOUGH was bumped leaving the gate then briefly showed speed outside.

backstretch, stayed close to the rail around the turn and weakened in the drive. NORMANS GIRL GAYLE was slow early, rallied the rail around the turn,
came out in late stretch and gained mildly. TRIBAL PRINCESS was slow to find best stride. IRON WILMA bumped with SPRING THE TRAPPE leaving the
gate, made a run along the rail around the turn then flattened out. BRIA AND GIGI was outrun. COSMOHEART was finished early. TARA'S Z VA stopped
three wide. SPRING THE TRAPPE bumped with IRON WILMA leaving the gate then was outrun. EMPRESS KYLEENA chased the early pace for about a
half then stopped.
