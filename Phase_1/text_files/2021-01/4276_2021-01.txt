Footnotes
CELIA'S PRIDE pressured the pace toward the inside, took the lead at the rail past the five sixteenths pole and raced clear toward the head of the lane,
then dug in under steady encouragement to hold off the late arrival of SPOOKY MOON, who gave chase through the backstretch and raced at the rail
rounding the turn, dug in the final furlong and was gaining steadily on the winner. BELLA FEMMINA bobbled slightly leaving the gate but picked up the
chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path and raced evenly down the lane. SING FROSTY came away a step slow then picked up
the chase, raced at the rail on the turn, was eased outward past the eighth pole but flattened stride. LILBITSOFDRAMA set a pressured early pace but gave
up the nod past the five sixteenths pole, dropped back nearing the head of the lane and flattened stride the final furlong. LOVIN MACHEN chased the
leaders, raced in the six path of the turn and showed little in the lane. HAPPY FREEDOM gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn five wide
and showed little more. ITSI BITSI chased through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the three path. REAL FANCY PANTS gave chase and saved
ground on the turn.

Footnotes
REMYS SHOWTIME took quick control to rate the pace off the rail, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and dueled clear two deep midway
on the far turn, then dug in under steady encouragement to hold on well. LET'S GET PHYSICAL settled off the early pace while saving ground, bid leaving
the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the four path of the far turn, dug in for second mid-stretch but couldn't gain further. NAUTICAL WARRIOR stalked the
pace inside, challenged from the three eighths pole but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened stride inside the eighth pole. BOP
MARLEY settled off the pace and off the rail, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and raced evenly through the lane.
SHORT CAKE'S MAN rounded the opening turn about the four path and raced outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, continued in the four path of the far turn and passed a rival down the lane. RUM RUNNER RED saved ground off the early pace and
showed little response through the backstretch. LUCKY PENGUIN stalked the early pace three wide, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but
weakened off the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
TANELEER took over approaching the three eighths pole and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, drew clear at the rail midway
on the turn and held on under steady stretch encouragement. YOUR MOM KNOWS chased the pace and drew close in the three path of the turn, was
edging closer late stretch but ran out of ground. BENROY chased the early pace outside, raced two deep through the turn, drifted a bit into the stretch and
got up for third later yards. GRANDPA MUNSTER pressured the pace and raced close off the rail on the turn, then flattened out inside the eighth pole.
DUNN DEAL was shuffled back on the chute then picked up the chase outside, rounded the turn in the three and four paths, angled out into the lane but
showed little further. BROTHER SKYE gave chase and saved ground on the turn, then weakened. PREACHER'S BAY chased the pace, raced off the rail
on the turn and showed little in the lane. MR. MAKOO broke a step slow and was not a factor.

Footnotes
CAYENNE CREEK settled close off the rail the opening turn then stalked into the backstretch, started a three wide bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and
ran close through the far turn, then dug in past the eighth pole to take the lead later yards and raced clear under the wire. OPERA NITE rated a slim early
lead inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, was caught in later yards and flattened stride nearing
the wire. WILLIAM AND MARY settled back off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, eased out into the
lane and finished evenly. RUSH TO THE CASTLE raced off the pace about the three path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole
and rounded the far turn still in the three path, but flattened out inside the eighth pole. BUFF'S EYE VIEW rounded the first turn in the four path, raced
outside into the backstretch and showed little response. GRUMPELSTILTSKIN angled in to stalk into the first turn, challenged nearing the three eighths pole
but dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened. ELLIE'S LIL MAN saved ground early on, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but
was taken up approaching the five sixteenths and walked off.

Footnotes
OLD LINE MAGIC rated the pace inside, was hand urged away from the five sixteenths pole and widened on the far turn, then kept alert through the stretch.
BELLY FLOP raced in the four path the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at
the rail, though had to settle for second best. FLICKER'S PRINCESS stalked the pace two deep the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the three
eighths pole, but dropped back toward the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn four wide and showed little more. ALL EYES ON ME saved ground early on,
picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, then showed little in the lane. RICH IMAGE settled off the pace in
the two and three paths the first turn, showed little response through the backstretch then rounded the far turn about the three path. BOTTLE COURAGE
saved ground. LWF DRIVE BYE GAL raced well back and never factored. VENETIAN DRIVE stalked the pace from the three path, gave chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole but weakened two deep on the far turn. UNEXPECTEDLY raced outside into the backstretch and was not a factor. LADY

WILLIE THE WHALE settled off the pace toward the inside, picked up the chase nearing the five sixteenths pole and raced two deep on the turn, dug in
from the eighth pole to take over mid-stretch and held on well. TRUTH SERUM broke a step slow then picked up the chase leaving the chute, rounded the
turn in the five and six paths, raced outside into the stretch and finished strong to take second the final strides. COCONUT MAN hesitated at the break then
picked up the chase outside, rounded the turn seven wide and dug in through the lane to get up and share third the final stride. FLASHY READY RICK
chased the pace, raced six wide on the turn then dug in through the lane and held on to share third. YOUREOUTOFCONTROL chased the pace inside,
lacked room near the rail through the turn then came through traffic in the stretch to finish evenly. FROSTY'S MAJESTY chased the pace, rounded the turn
about the three path but flattened stride late yards. WINDSOR CALLING gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path then
flattened stride the final sixteenth. GATTOSING was not a factor. SALERNO chased the pace, raced at the rail on the turn then weakened. I'M ABLE was
hustled along with the early lead, rounded the turn at the rail but was caught mid-stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
CARTER'S RUN rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths and raced well off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid past the seven
sixteenths pole, steadily improved to take the lead in the five path approaching the head of the lane, drew clear past the eighth pole and widened under
steady encouragement. DYNAFORM raced well off the pace and off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase into the backstretch, angled to the seven path
rounding the far turn then dug in through the lane to take second the final strides. NO REGRETS settled close into the backstretch, picked up the chase
from the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead at the quarter, raced briefly clear midway on the far turn but was caught toward the head of the lane then
nipped from second the final strides. EASTPORT veered out at the start and raced in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path but flattened stride the final sixteenth. ONCE MORE EH saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the
three eighths pole but lacked room at the rail rounding the far turn, angled out into the stretch then flattened stride the final sixteenth. CREEKMORE saved
ground off the pace, bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced three wide on the far turn then flattened. VOODOO VALLEY raced well back from early
contention and was never a factor. AWESOME BUZZ angled in to stalk two deep early, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced close
through the backstretch, but dropped back toward the head of the lane and weakened. CHUCK'S DREAM rated the pace inside, came under pressure
leaving the seven sixteenth pole, was caught at the quarter and weakened at the rail on the far turn. SILVER CASTLE rounded the first turn in the three and
four paths, raced outside into the backstretch and picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, but, weakened on the far turn.

SOUND OFF rounded the first turn about the three path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced five wide
on the far turn, angled six wide into the stretch and dug in for the lead the final yards. BIG BOOTS raced in the five path the first turn and settled off the pace
into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took a slim lead in the four path approaching the top of the stretch, dug in under steady
encouragement to draw briefly clear mid-stretch, but was caught in the final yards. LION LORD showed the way through the front stretch then stalked inside
from the nine sixteenths pole, picked up the chase toward the five sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn then dueled for third the final sixteenth. HOBE
SOUND settled off the early pace in the three and four paths, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the four path, then
flattened stride in the later duel for third. SPOKANE EAGLE settled just off the pace about the three path the first turn, closed to the lead approaching the
five sixteenths and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was caught nearing the head of the lane and weakened the final sixteenth. LASER
LOOP saved ground the opening turn then steadied approaching the half mile pole, bid nearing the three eighths, raced at the rail on the far turn then
flattened stride. SINGANOTHERSONG angled in to take the lead two deep at the nine sixteenths pole, was caught toward the five sixteenths, raced in the
three path of the far turn then weakened. DESTINY'S CHARGE saved ground off the pace then faded through the backstretch. THE IRON BANK was not a
factor.

PEACEFUL CHILD angled to the outside to give chase, rounded the turn about the six path but drifted wider into the lane, then dug in under steady
encouragement to get up the final yards. SONDE OF MUSIC pressured the pace through the backstretch and contested at a close disadvantage two deep
on the turn, dueled to a brief slim lead inside the sixteenth pole but was caught in the closing yards. NICE N' BROAD gave chase outside, rounded the turn
about the four path, was forced wider into the stretch but got up for third the final strides. MALIBU SPLASH chased the pace inside, took aim at the rail in
later yards but was nipped from third the final stride. COLLEGE KID surged to the front at the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, contested the edge
nearest the rail on the turn, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the turn but was caught past the sixteenth pole and flattened stride. GANDARI gave
chase through the backstretch and saved ground, to no avail, on the turn. THREE BOPS chased the pace through the backstretch, eased out toward the
head of the lane then weakened. VIOLANE never factored.

Footnotes
ROYAL BLUE raced in the three and four paths the first turn then started an outside bid into the backstretch, improved steadily six wide on the far turn, dug
in at the head of the lane and got up the final yards. BINN GOODE took the lead quickly and rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the quarter
pole and raced at the rail rounding the far turn, dug in to steady stretch encouragement but was caught in the final yards. APPROVETHISMESSAGE stalked
the pace off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the three and four paths of the far turn, angled to the
five path into the stretch but flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. KATMAN QUICK settled off the earlier pace inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths
pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, then flattened stride through later yards. THE SEVEN FIVE rounded the opening turn in the five path and stalked
into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, had range five wide on the far turn but flattened out the final sixteenth. BAY HILL
raced off the pace inside the first turn, started a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, came through the far turn three wide and finished evenly. THE CREEP
stalked the early pace about the three path, gave chase from the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, then weakened. CHESAPEAKE
CHARLIE was not a factor. CHARITABLE HERO raced outside into the backstretch and showed little response. BLIMEY LIMEY was through early.
