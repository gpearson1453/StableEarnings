THIRD TIME AROUND bumped with TAKE ME AS I AM at the start, sped to the front, set the pace in the two path, kicked clear in midstretch and just
lasted. DONTPUSHYOURLUCK raced off the pace two wide, angled five wide in upper stretch, closed outside and ran out of ground. DRIVING WIND
settled off the pace while racing three wide, rallied through the lane but was outkicked. IN VAIN stalked the pace from the rail, bid in midstretch and flattened
out late. SWEET BABY RAELYNN broke slowly, saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. WHAT A TRICK pressed the
winner in the three path and tired in the lane. MA REVE saved ground to no avail. TAKE ME AS I AM was bumped by the winner at the start, chased the
pace two wide and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
SENZAZIONE vied early inside EL ZEUS and WARRANT OFFICER before letting those two go on with it, moved out and rebid from outside around the
turn, drifted to the five-path reaching a short lead at the top of the stretch, and prevailed after a long drive. EL ZEUS vied for command inside WARRANT
OFFICER up the backstretch and into the turn, fought back when overtaken by SENZAZIONE, and stayed on stubbornly to the finish. WARRANT OFFICER
argued the pace outside EL ZEUS for six furlongs, could not match strides with the top two in upper stretch, but ran on with good courage clearly best of the
others. EXCALIBUR lost ground to the first flight after a half-mile, moved out four wide past the quarter-pole and could not gain. MIKE IS READY dropped
back early, raced five wide into the lane and made no headway. POWER (BRZ) was outrun inside. PROSPECT PROJECT lunged at the start to get away
slowest, and was finished after a half-mile.

Footnotes
KING SNAKE set a rated pace along the rail, shrugged off bids approaching the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch, switched leads multiple times through
the lane and held firm under a drive. GEAR JOCKEY stalked the pace three deep bid nearing the quarter pole, could not keep pace in upper stretch but
finished willingly to narrow the gap a bit. EAGERLY prompted the winner two wide, bid between foes nearing the lane and was outfinished. THE ANGRY
MAN hit the starting gate, raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. UNCLE RENNY was in range inside
but was through after a half.

Footnotes
KIFFLE saved ground tracking the early leaders, rallied through a seam between KATIELEIGH and CAT'S ASTRAY near the quarter-pole, wrested
command from the latter through the furlong grounds and edged clear, then held AWSUM ROAR safe late. AWSUM ROAR was outsprinted early, came
four wide off the turn and closed strongly outside the winner. DANCING DOLL brushed with HEIR BALL at the start, raced at or near the inside through the
turn, and rallied mildly for a share. CAT'S ASTRAY set the pace inside, got headed by KIFFLE with an eighth of a mile to go, and weakened. SWEET YARE
N DIRA raced three wide around the turn, and made no impact through the lane on the far outside. KATIELEIGH pressed the pace outside CAT'S ASTRAY
in the three-path, and gave way turning for home. HEIR BALL brushed with DANCING DOLL at the start, moved inside approaching the stretch, and tired
through the late stages.

Footnotes
LUANN bobbled at the break, was bumped soon after, cruised up four wide around the turn, blew by the pacesetter leaving the three-eighths pole drew off
under mild urging. FLORADO set the pace along the rail, drew well clear around the turn, was collared in upper stretch, could not keep pace with the winner
but stayed on to finish far clear of the rest. TRINNI SUNSHINE hit the starting gate, moved up three wide around the turn and lacked a closing bid.
EMPEROR'S SONG was pushed out at the start and lightly bumped the winner, saved ground and never threatened. ISADELAS DREAM was firmly rated
between foes and was through after a half. TRINNI CUTIE PIE had brief speed three wide. NATURELL (ECU) was eased in the lane, pulled up shortly after
the wire and was vanned off.

LIONESSOFBRITTANY contested the pace outside DANESSA BABY and CALIFORNIA LILY, reached a short lead through upper stretch and edged away,
then kept MAGICAL SOUL at a safe distance late. MAGICAL SOUL broke a step slow, was outsprinted two then three wide to the end of the turn, and
finished well too late outside the winner. AGOG spotted the field a couple lengths at the break, moved inside before reaching the turn, loomed along the rail
in upper stretch but could not sustain the bid. FOUZIA raced off the first flight three then four wide around the turn, and finished evenly. DANESSA BABY
vied inside rivals to the stretch, and gave way through the last eighth of a mile. VIVA LA REINA eyed the battling leaders two then three wide around the
turn, and lacked a closing bid. CALIFORNIA LILY argued the pace between horses to the end of the turn, and gave way. HARA was finished early three
wide.

SPEARGUN stalked the pace three wide in the clear, seized command near the sixteenth pole and drove clear late. TIMEWON'TLETMEGO set the pace
along the rail, turned back a bid nearing the lane, continued on the left lead through the stretch, led to the sixteenth marker and held well for the place.
KHOZANDO raced off the pace outside, angled four wide early on the turn, lacked the needed rally but was along for the show. ENSIGN PARKER pressed
the pace two wide, reached near even terms near the five-sixteenths pole and weakened in the drive. BUENISIMO saved ground and failed to menace.
BRACCIO DI FERRO raced off the pace between foes down the backstretch, angled five wide early on the turn and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
CALIBRATOR grabbed the lead after bumping lightly with RANGER UP at the break, established an even pace along the inside for six furlongs, and
responded to pressure to remain in command. BREAK BEAT was outrun early, shifted out three wide approaching the stretch, and rallied outside rivals to
get up for the place. THENORTHREMEMBERS raced three wide around the turns, moved to the rail in upper stretch and finished one-paced. ZIPALONG
lagged at the back for a half-mile, advanced three then four wide around the far turn, had aim outside the leader in upper stretch, but flattened out late
between horses. CAPTAIN DUKE pursued the pacesetter from outside for a half-mile, dropped back steadily around the far turn while unhurried, was
roused into the lane and ran on late past tired horses. BODIE CODY faded inside after six furlongs. RANGER UP bumped lightly with CALIBRATOR at the
start, saved ground for a half, moved out three wide on the far turn and made no progress. MY BOY BLUE stayed in range three wide to the end of the far
turn, and gave way.

Footnotes
IMPRIMIS was bumped between foes at the start, raced off the pace two wide, angled five wide near the quarter pole, surged outside and was up in the final
strides. EXTRAVAGANT KID broke in and bumped BLIND AMBITION at the start, raced off the pace three wide, cruised up in hand around the turn, made
good progress while still patiently handled in upper stretch, was roused near the eighth pole, closed inside of the winner, drifted in a bit, was urged once
left-handed in deep stretch and just missed. THE CRITICAL WAY set the pace in the two path, held clear past the sixteenth pole, led until the final strides
but could not quite stave off the top two. HARRY'S ONTHELOOSE saved ground in range and lacked a rally. SAYYAAF broke out and bumped the winner
at the start, pressed the pace in the three path and weakened in the lane. BLIND AMBITION was bumped between rivals at the start and trailed two wide.

GULF COAST advanced four wide around the turn, collared ADIOS TRIPPI from outside at the top of the stretch, kicked clear with a sixteenth remaining,
then held on late. HONORIFIQUE got bumped by GLADYS at the break, then was forced out by ORBS BABY GIRL right after that, began to get rolling four
wide after six furlongs, rallied steadily through the lane and was gaining outside the winner to the wire. ADIOS TRIPPI set a solid pace inside, could not hold
off GULF COAST through upper stretch, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile. SHEA D SUMMER raced forwardly two wide for six furlongs,
moved to the rail turning for home, and gave way while shortening stride. ORBS BABY GIRL broke outward, prompted the early pace outside ADIOS
TRIPPI, and gave way around the turn. GLADYS bumped HONORIFIQUE at the start and was very slow into stride, remained far back despite urging up the
backstretch, and made little progress after that. SKY PROPOSAL delayed the start very difficult to load, and retired early inside. QUINOA TIFAH showed
brief speed, and was through after a half-mile.
