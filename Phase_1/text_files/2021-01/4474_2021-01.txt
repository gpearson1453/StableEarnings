Footnotes
DARLING JOANNA saved ground on the first turn, settled off the inside on the backstretch, was roused while two to three wide on the far turn then driven
four wide into the stretch, dropped in while gaining on the leader, made a bid inside that foe into the final furlong, took the advantage into the final sixteenth
and just held under strong urging. GIFTED TALENT dropped in early, settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch,
rallied on the outside while swapping leads back and forth, closed well to make a bid into the final sixteenth but was denied while able to get the place.
LIVELY LEA went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the far turn, took the lead while floating six wide into
upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong, lost the advantage into the final sixteenth, drifted out near that point then fought on to the wire but
missed while able to get the show. KUHLKE broke out at the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, was urged along while
inside on the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch, moved to the two path while gaining outside the furlong marker, shifted further out behind the leaders
around the sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage but missed the trifecta while a long ways clear for the last spot in the superfecta. EXPLOSIVELY
HOT was keen into the first turn, went around the bend in the two path, settled near the middle of the field, was urged along in the two path on the far turn
and failed to respond. LUCKY HARBORAGE went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged three to four wide on the far turn and also
failed to respond. CUSTOM GULCH went three to four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, dropped back five wide on the far turn then floated six
wide into the stretch and had nothing left. THE MISSING PIECE was hustled from the start, angled in while going to the front, set the pace near the inside,
was asked on the far turn, lost the advantage into upper stretch and faded. STEAL THE STARS rounded the first turn in the two path, settled in third
position, was urged along while saving ground on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and retreated. NOTTODAYFELLAS was taken up badly
at the start and off slow, spotted the front many lengths, raced inside to the two path on the turns and was no factor. GO MY JULIET went five wide on the
first turn, raced well back in the field, traveled around the far turn in the two path, came three wide into upper stretch and showed little. (Rail at 17 feet)

Footnotes
CURLINGTON went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved towards the rear, raced four wide while roused on the far turn, came six wide into the
stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late. BRIAR JUMPER bumped soundly with a rival at the start, went three wide on
the first turn, settled towards the rear, rounded the far turn in the two path, steadied while lacking room behind horses when beaten to a hole at the
three-sixteenths, rallied in the final furlong and closed well to get the place. DEANOS CAPE went three wide on the first turn, raced just off the pace, was
asked between horses in the two path on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch then tipped further out, rallied to the lead at the furlong marker, led
into the final sixteenth but was caught while just able to get the show. MATHESON settled on the inside, drafted behind the leader on the far turn, was
asked in the two path at the quarter-pole, beat BRIAR JUMPER to an opening around the three-sixteenths, gained to make a bid into the final furlong, fought
on well to the wire but just missed the trifecta. DAY TRIP broke in and bumped soundly with a foe, went five wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the
outside, was asked in the three path on the far turn, chased five wide into upper stretch then made a bid, battled under a drive into the final sixteenth and
was outfinished. JUNIOR BUG went four wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the far turn, took the lead outside
the three-sixteenths, lost the advantage outside the furlong marker, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened. JACK THE RIPPER (FR) came
away last, was very rank while hard held on the initial straightaway then taken up nearing the first turn, went five wide while tugging at the bit on that bend,
continued rank early on the backstretch before finally settling more kindly, was asked in the four path on the far turn, moved out outside the three-sixteenths
and lacked the needed response. CONATIVE dropped back while crowded between horses early, went two to three wide on the turns, came five wide into
the stretch and was no factor. DOM CAETANO (ARG) rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved towards the inside, saved ground under urging on
the far turn, came out three wide into the stretch and failed to respond. MAX PANDOWDY went to the front, set the pace in the two path while in hand, was
asked while headed at the quarter-pole, dropped back into the final furlong and gave way. HE'S A LUCKY MAN went four wide on the first turn, settled off
the pace, dropped back three wide leaving the backstretch and faltered. (Rail at 17 Feet)

Footnotes
MILLENNIUM FORCE showed speed on the inside of a foe then moved out and chased that rival, went around the turn in the two path, came three wide
into the stretch, pursued the leader under a drive into the final sixteenth and got up under strong urging. SIKUM settled on the outside, went three then four
wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the place. COBRA CASABLANCA was fractious in the gate, showed speed on the
outside then moved clear with a half-mile to run, dictated terms in the two path on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth but
was overtaken then lost the place while able to get the show. TIPSY GAL bumped soundly with a rival at the start then bobbled, moved out under some
urging, went four wide on the turn, was carried seven wide into the stretch and improved position for the last spot in the superfecta. LISTEN UP broke out
then was corrected by the rider, moved in while rated towards the front, lost position badly and dropped back significantly while taking some awkward strides
into the turn, was guided around that bend with extra left-rein pressure, was put to a drive off the rail in upper stretch, chased into the final sixteenth and was
out-kicked. SUGAR AND SASS broke out and bumped with a rival, raced well back in the field, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch
and gained but failed to seriously threaten. LEA'S PRINCESS was unsettled in the gate, broke in the air and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths,
went around the turn in the three path then came four wide into the stretch and also gained but failed to threaten. BLUES MARY bumped soundly with a
rival at the start, settled under some urging, was taken up and dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the
two path and failed to respond. MOON OF LOVE (IRE) bumped with a foe at the start, settled on the outside, chased three wide on the turn then four wide
into the stretch, dropped back while still on her inside to the furlong marker and capitulated. (Rail at 17 Feet)

Footnotes
STAR OF KODIAK moved up after breaking towards the rear, was well placed towards the front, saved ground on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch,
made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths then took the lead, shook clear outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best under steady urging. WILE E
PEYOTE angled in while settling off the pace, saved ground on the turn, chased under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly for the place while unable
to match the winner. EMBOLDEN tracked the pace on the outside, chased two to three wide on the turn, was carried five wide into upper stretch, dropped
back into the final furlong and weakened but held the show. TELL YOUR DADDY settled towards the rear, was taken under a vigorous hold from the
seven-sixteenths to the three-eighths then was taken up, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive inside the
three-sixteenths and improved position. DUNCASTLE moved in while going clear, raced inside to the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch
then lost the lead under urging and tired. POWER END settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came three wide into the stretch, dropped in outside
the furlong marker and failed to threaten. BROTH settled at the rear, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor. SIR ALFRED JAMES settled
on the outside, went four wide on the turn, drifted out inside the three-sixteenths and failed to rally. NUCKY settled on the outside, was urged three wide on
the turn and came up empty. ITS A WRAP broke out and a step slow, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and never
reached contention.

pursued the runner-up into the final sixteenth and got up under strong urging. SHAKIN SILVER broke in at the start, moved in then chased the pace on the
outside, went three wide on the turn, took the lead in upper stretch, drifted out outside the furlong marker, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was
caught while clear for the place. JADE'S CLASSY ONE broke in and bumped with a rival, was urged along near the rear, went around the turn in the two
path, moved out under a drive at the furlong marker and finished with late energy to safely secure the show. FLUFFPOINT showed good speed and set the
pace, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage in upper stretch and gave way. COMERUNNINBOYS was ridden along in the back half of the field,
angled in near the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. HE'S TAYLOR MADE broke out then
stumbled badly and dropped back quickly, spotted the front several lengths, went three wide on the turn and was no factor. THE THREE KS was urged
along on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. MIDNIGHT NIGHTMARE was urged along
towards the front, rounded the turn in the two path and capitulated. RUNNIN BRAVE bumped with foes on both sides at the start, moved in under urging
early, drifted out near the half-mile pole, went four wide on the turn then came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MINISTER'S MEDAL broke in
