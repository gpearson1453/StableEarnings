untracked throughout widest str. SUMMER SWEETHEART never menaced. MI ENLACE never a threat. GET ME A DIAMOND good position between

too late. MOTAGALLY good speed to the front, stayed grudgingly in the final furlong with a good effort. SURF AND TURF perfect position throughout,
steadied along in the final sixteenth from inside with no where to go.. SPEEDY HANS chased leader to far turn, steadied twice in the final sixteenth.
PERFECTLY MAJESTIC unhurried to far turn, never impacted from the half. HELLORHIGHWATER bothered at start, raced evenly with no late kick. J W
RUCKUS never a menace. TOSS OF FATE bore out start, never a threat thereafter. CEDUNA failed to menace. MONEY FOR MISCHIEF through after half.
