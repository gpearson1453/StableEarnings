Footnotes
AWESOME BEACH set the pace along the rail, shrugged off a bid from TRY ME midway around the turn, drew off in upper stretch, continued on the left
lead through the lane and widened under a drive. GLOBALTROUBLECOCO saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and rallied to gain the
place late. BIG CYPRESS chased the pace from the rail, tipped out in upper stretch and was one-paced through the lane. TRY ME prompted the winner two
wide, bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole but tired in the drive. SADIO was bumped at the start, raced well back four wide and improved position in the lane.
PRINCE TRITON chased the pace two and three wide and came up empty in the lane. TRUE IDENTITY played no factor while racing three wide.
MINDSHIP Q was outrun two wide. TRINNI LIGHT was bumped at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
GIMME SOME MO set the pace along the inside, kicked clear from chasing foes in upper stretch, and widened through the lane. SMALL TALK tucked down
to the rail into the first turn, stalked the pace along the inside, forged place from outer rivals turning for home as GIMME SOME MO kicked away, proved no
match for that foe in upper stretch, but stayed well clear of show thereafter. MAKER OF AN EMPIRE saved ground off of the pace, and improved position
along the rail through the lane. THE ANGRY MAN lied forwardly placed three to two wide and between horses around the first turn, but retreated to midpack
into the backstretch, shifted four wide turning for home, then stayed on for a minor share without threatening. LIGHT CRUISER prompted the eventual
winner from the outside, but failed to keep pace with that foe around the far turn before weakening between horses turning for home. AUGUSTA MELODY
stalked four to three wide around the first turn, held striking position three wide around the far turn, but weakened approaching the lane. ORAN lagged well
behind the field throughout and showed little. FAVORED lied off of the pace two wide, but unfortunately went wrong in upper stretch, fell, and perished on
the track.

Footnotes
BACCHANALIA stalked the pace two wide, seized command near the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. CHOATE
BRIDGE settled off the pace two wide, steadied near the five-eighths pole, advanced three wide around the far turn and finished willingly to narrow the gap.
ASK BAILEY saved ground off the pace, advanced four deep rounding the far turn but had only a mild kick while trying to lug in throughout the stretch run.
NO WAY JOSE (IRE) broke outwardly, saved ground off the pace, went two wide in range around the far turn and was outfinished for the show. OCEANS
OF LOVE was forced out at the start, pressed the pace two wide, drew clear midway down the backstretch, set the pace along the rail around the far turn
and weakened in the drive. VICTORY CRUSADE set the early pace along the rail and retreated after a half.

Footnotes
CHURCHILLS VICTORY set the pace along the inside, came under a drive passing the quarter mile pole to hold an advantage as NIMBLE BEAST ranged
up and ONE EYE JACK loomed behind, shook clear of those foes in upper stretch, then held while hanging on his left lead through the lane. ONE EYED
JACK stalked along the inside, loomed large just behind the leader at the quarter pole, smoothly tipped outside of that foe entering the lane, but lacked a
kick and only managed to chase him home. TIZ LIGHT THE WAY lied far off of the pace in the three path around the turn, then improved position between
horses inside the final furlong. NIMBLE BEAST broke outwardly, lied close to the pace two wide, shifted three wide into the turn, surpassed a tiring foe and
bid for the lead two wide approaching the quarter pole, but tired turning for home, and weakened. ULTRACONFIDENT bumped an outer foe in the opening
furlong, lied off of the pace in the two path around the turn, then failed to factor while hanging on his left lead through the lane. RANGER UP took back from
being crowded between horses early on after an inner foe broke outwards, lied off of the pace in the four to five path around the turn, and failed to factor.
NEVERSTOPDREAMING prompted the pace two wide, but weakened between horses passing the three furlong pole, and was done early. BIG
TREASURE took a bump from an inner rival in the early stages, then was well outrun throughout, and showed little.

Footnotes
POR QUE NO moved two wide to the front around the first turn, angled in late on the bend to set the pace along the rail, shrugged off some challengers
nearing the lane, drew clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive. MUNNYFOR RO lacked early speed while racing two wide, advanced between
rivals rounding the far turn, swung out in upper stretch and finished strongly outside. FRANKIE'S GIRL led early, steadied along inside for a half, remained
up close inside around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and was one-paced. BRYNBELLA was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide,
made good progress outside down the backstretch, bid three wide nearing the lane and weakened in the drive. WINTER PRINCESS went evenly while
racing two wide. IRAZU was off a bit slow, raced well back three wide early, moved up two wide around the far turn, made progress inside in upper stretch
and flattened out late. VERY SAVVY was bumped at the start, pressed the winner three then two wide, bid between foes nearing the lane and tired in the
stretch. PANOTTI chased the pace three wide and faded around the far turn. CONVENTIONALWISDOM saved ground off the pace early, went four wide
around the far turn and never threatened. DERALDINE saved ground early, went four wide around the far turn and was always outrun. BACKSPARK was
outrun inside. BERTRADA was bumped at the start and played no further factor while racing four and five.

Footnotes
NOCTURNAL lunged inwards at the start and bumped a rival, recovered to set the pace after a furlong, showed the way in hand through quick fractions,
inched clear of pressing foes with five sixteenths to run, responded well to driving pressure at the furlong marker, and finished strong to widen his advantage
while needing correction from lugging out. NO MORE BUSINESS stalked along the inside, shifted out to the two path approaching the quarter pole to bid for
place inside of BOLD AGENDA as the leader scooted away, brushed with the aforementioned rival straightening into the lane, then prevailed over that foe
for place while hanging on his left lead and proving no match for the leader. BOLD AGENDA lacked early speed and settled off of the pace along the inside,
commenced a rally along the rail into the turn before shifting three wide approaching the five sixteenths marker, produced a bid for place outside of NO
MORE BUSINESS turning for home as his stablemate kicked clear, but failed to match strides with that foe through the final furlong. BRAZILLIONAIRE
prompted the pace setter from the outside, but weakened between other foes approaching the quarter pole. IMPERIAL CONFLICT was bumped by an outer
rival at the start, lied forwardly placed three wide, but faded while getting floated four wide approaching the five sixteenths pole. OR'EFFICE bobbled at the
start, took a few strides to get his feet back underneath him, pulled outside of the group after doing so to achieve a stalking position leaving the chute, but
faded passing the half mile pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
GOT GLEE set the pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and held sway under confident handling. FIGHTRESS had early speed inside of the
winner, was wrangled back off the pace nearing the turn, remained in hand around much of the bend, angled three wide in upper stretch, split rivals nearing
the eighth pole and rallied. SWEETLY MAID raced off the pace two wide, angled five wide in upper stretch and rallied for the show. AFFICIONADO (FR)
prompted the pace three wide, bid nearing the lane but flattened out. SUBSIDIARY pressed the pace between foes and weakened in the drive. NOT NICE
steadied at the start, raced two and three wide and never threatened. BRIGHT VENEZUELAN was outrun inside.

Footnotes
KATNISS KAN lied far off of the pace in the three path into the turn, gained ground in hand and loomed behind the leader turning for home, tipped out at the
three sixteenths pole, bid in upper stretch, and drew off. LALALI chased two wide, got outmoved by GALIT JAK passing the three furlong pole, tipped out
and bid for the lead outside of that foe at the quarter pole, forged an advantage turning for home, but was headed passing the furlong pole. LEO'S
DIAMOND tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, shifted inwards in upper stretch, and rallied on his left lead along the rail for a minor share.
SHELLPHONE lied off of the pace along the inside, shifted three wide turning for home, and stayed on. GALIT JAK stalked three wide, moved forward into
the turn while shifting down to the two path, forged an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, but was headed in upper stretch, and tired.
TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE tracked from midpack in the four path, advanced to striking range approaching the quarter pole, but was outmoved by the eventual
winner at the three sixteenths marker, and flattened out. DINNER AT FIVE lied off of the pace, gained in the five path around the turn, got floated six wide
turning for home, and flattened out. MYSTIC COMIN HOME was off a step slowly, raced far off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the four path around
the bend, and failed to factor. MY LITTLE JOHARA trailed in the four path into the turn, and failed to factor. TWINKIESANDTURNIPS lied forwardly placed
along the inside early on, but was done into the turn. FLYING SOFIA lost her hind footing at the start, rallied in the five path around the turn, but weakened
turning for home. DELTA HUTCH was sent to a clear lead early on, but was headed with five sixteenths to run, weakened turning for home, and stopped
through the lane.

Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE RO was bumped by an inner foe at the start, lied forwardly placed in the three path around the first turn, lost position down the backstretch,
shifted from the two path to the four path turning for home while commencing a re-rally, bid for the lead outside of SPUNGLE passing the furlong marker,
dueled outside of that foe to the wire, and prevailed. SPUNGIE stalked two wide and between horses, shifted three wide around the far turn to commence a
rally, bid for the lead passing the furlong pole while inside of TAKE CHARGE RO, dueled with that foe to the wire, but was bested. STAR COMMAND
managed a loose lead around both turns, stayed clear in upper stretch, but tired, got headed approaching the final sixteenth, and gave way. COALITION
BUILDING rated off of the pace three wide around both turns, shifted five wide while commencing a rally in upper stretch, and produced a mild kick. OCEAN
AIR rated while saving ground far off of the pace around the first turn, took the far turn three wide, rallied while shifting six wide in midstretch, and stayed on
late. COASTANA saved ground in midpack, but came under a drive into the far turn, and had little response. LADY ROSALIE (IRE) stalked along the inside,
tipped to the four path in upper stretch, but weakened. L'INDISCRET bumped an outer foe at the start, stalked two wide, but was outkicked by outer foes
turning for home, and faded. SATURDAY SUN took the turns far off of the pace two to four wide, shifted six wide turning for home, and failed to factor.
TIZEMOTIONALGOLD lied off of the pace two wide and between horses around both turns, and never got involved. MY HAPPY GIRL pulled in the four path
around the first turn to a stalking position, but faded in that lane around the far turn.
