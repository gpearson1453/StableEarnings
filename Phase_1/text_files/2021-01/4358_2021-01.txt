JADEY AT THE BAR pressed the early pace, went four wide into the turn, dueled with DRAFTY BREEZE to late stretch and prevailed. DRAFTY BREEZE
set a pressured early pace, went six wide into the turn, dueled with the winner and just missed. CURRENTLYMYPROBLEM was unhurried early, raced
between rivals into the turn, angled out seven wide in early stretch, drifted in and was along for third. MY FUNNY GAL was allowed to settle early, circled
eight wide and passed tired rivals. LIEUTENANT MARGIE stalked the early pace, went three wide into the turn and faded. TAX MONEY was up close early
from between rivals and weakened.

Footnotes
MAGIC MOSCO was up close early, went five wide into the turn, was gaining late and was up in time for the win. INQUISITEUR stalked the early pace,
went three wide into the turn, took a brief lead in mid stretch, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best. WILL YA WIN SUM was void of speed,
raced between rivals in late stretch, angled out late and was closing fast. VROYSKY set a pressured early pace, went four wide into the turn and finished
evenly late. GREAT ULYSSES was taken back early, circled nine wide through the turn and finished belatedly. HIGEAR HARRY pressed the early pace,
went six wide and faded. TENGA'S GOLD raced in mid pack early, went six wide into the turn, drifted in late and weakened. KIJANI was reluctant to load,
was unhurried and was no threat.
