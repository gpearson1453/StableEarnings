Footnotes
PRINCESS LIVIA broke sharply, angled inwards dictating the pace in the two path through the backstretch into the turn, then steadily widened her
advantage to the end under firm encouragement. MULBERRY was urged pursuing the pacesetter racing just outside that foe into the bend, couldn't
maintain striking distance nearing upper stretch but held rivals for the place honors. SHALL RETURN tracked off the second flight between foes racing to
the turn, shifted out to race three deep between rivals in the closing stages and edged a rival for a share. FIELD LETTERS tracked the leaders three wide
between foes into the turn, was fanned four wide racing into the stretch and had no closing bid. PASSION'S IMAGE, caught four wide tracking off the
second flight racing to the turn, shifted inwards nearing the lane and steadily faded. LAKOTA PRINCESS was urged along the inside pursuing the
pacesetter into the turn and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
PIRATE PARADE broke readily, angled inwards dictating the pace just off the rail racing into the turn, turned back challengers racing past midstretch and
edged clear under firm right handed encouragement. FLIPPING FUN, bumped at the start, recovered to track off the second flight between foes racing to
the turn, shifted to the four path in upper stretch and edged a rival for the place honors while failing to gain even terms with the winenr. MONDAY'S WITH
MIKE broke outwards bumping FLIPPING FUN, was righted, then urged pursuing the pacesetter in the three path racing into the turn, moved to striking
distance in upper stretch but had no final kick. RAL COPPERHEADROAD, reserved near the inside racing to the turn, shifted outside foes nearing upper
stretch, angled back to the rail entering the lane and continued to improve position. OUR STUIE, reluctant to load, was held up avoiding tight quarters at the
start, dropped well off the field racing to the turn and passed some tiring rivals late. TIZ TRIUMPHANT tracked the pacesetter inside a rival as part of the
second flight through the backstretch but steadily faded racing into the turn. SILVER DOLLAR CITY tracked off the second flight racing four wide on the
backstretch and faded early.

Footnotes
LADY JEAN joined the pace three wide in the opening stages pressing the issue, went clear racing into the turn while angling nearer to the inside, held sway
just off the rail racing into upper stretch and widened the advantage late under firm encouragement. BAHAMIAN MOON angled inwards pressing a rival's
pace between foes in the opening quarter, continued with a steady effort just outside the leader to upper stretch and proved best of the others. CHILLIN
LADY tracked off the first flight along the inside, shifted out three wide entering the lane and continued with an effort to gain some position while prevailing
for a share. SMOOTH AS GLASS angled inwards racing through the backstretch prompting the pace inside foes, continued to pursue the pacesetter to
upper stretch and faded in late stages. R D BLESSING settled nearest the inside racing to the turn and passed inside some tiring rivals in late stages.
PALOMA MIA tracked off the first flight racing four wide into the turn and steadily faded into upper stretch. REYNA DE VERANO, shuffled back out of close
quarters at the start, raced widest throughout while never proving a serious threat. DAWNDETTI WAS SCRATCHED AT THE GATE ON THE ADVICE OF
THE VETERINARIAN.

Footnotes
ROCK THE PARK tracked off the first flight while between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a
steady late bid to wrest the advantage in time under right handed pressure. PRIZED WARRIOR, forwardly placed along the rail prompting a rival's pace into
the first turn, was eased off the leaders entering the backstretch to track off the first flight inside foes, shifted out three wide entering the far turn while being
prompted to advance, wrested a narrow advantage with a quarter mile to go, shifted inwards entering the stretch disputing the issue to late stages but
couldn't fend off the winner. SILVER EDGE angled inwards racing to the first turn prompting the pace outside a rival, then between foes racing to the
backstretch, dueled for command inside a rival into the far turn, continued to dispute the issue past midstretch but was outkicked by the top pair. SILENT
MISCHIEF angled to the inside in early stages tracking well off the second flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch gaining brief
contention but lacked the needed final bid. PREQUALIFIED, urged to a position outside a rival in second flight, was urged to advance in tandem with the
eventual winner racing into the far turn, was fanned five wide nearing upper stretch and faded in the drive. POCO CHARLIE settled outside foes racing three
deep to the first turn, continued five wide into the backstretch and never gained contention. BRICE, off slowly, was urged to terms with the first flight three
wide prompting the pace racing to the backstretch, dueled for command between on the far turn and gave out entering upper stretch. TEXAS GIANT settled
near the inside early and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
LADY CLOVERLY ducked out at the start bumping BEAUTIFUL DIVA, was collected, then rated inside that rival tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the
backstretch, tipped out racing into upper stretch to bid for command between foes, wrested the advantage, then drifted out despite right handed pressure,
but kicked away in the closing stages. SHE'S AN ALPHA, off slowly, was settled between foes in the last flight racing under reserve to the backstretch, was
prompted to split foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch, then angled four wide in the closing stages while finishing with interest to prove best of the
others. TRULY tracked off the second flight three deep to the backstretch, angled to the inside racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to gain
position while prevailing for a share. FREEDOM MACHINE angled to the inside early tracking off the second flight into the backstretch, shifted out to race
three deep between foes in the closing stages and continued evenly. TWISTED TREASURE sped to the lead along the rail leaving the chute, dictated the
pace on a clear margin to the far turn, contested the issue to upper stretch and gave out leaving the furlong marker. BEAUTIFUL DIVA, bumped at the start,
recovered to track just off the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the far turn, shifted out three wide in upper stretch to lodge a brief bid but had no final kick.
RACHEL'S WISH angled inwards to track just off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch but steadily faded nearing the lane. MONAD, off a
bit slowly, was settled last outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. MISS BOOMER BABE proved no factor.

CARAMEL CHIP, slow to gather stride, settled off the second flight along the inside racing to the turn, saved ground on the bend gathering momentum
nearing upper stretch, swung out four wide entering the lane and continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage in time under firm
encouragement. JACKSON STRONG, in touch with the pacesetter from the outset prompting that rival through the backstretch, pressed the issue three
wide racing through the turn to upper stretch gaining a narrow advantage, couldn't contain the winner's bid but narrowly prevailed for the place honors
between foes. R GOODTIME CHARLIE, urged to the lead disputing the pace shifting off the rail nearing the turn, dueled for command between rivals on the
bend, exchanged bumps with SHOO SHINE entering upper stretch, continued to contest the issue inside foes to the end but was just outkicked. SHOO
SHINE tracked just off the leaders along the inside in the opening stages, came through along the rail when presented an opening racing into the turn to
challenge for command, exchanged bumps, then steadied out of tight quarters racing past the three sixteenths marker, altered course to bid three wide
between foes in the closing stages but was just outkicked for a share. YES SIR ROBERT was rated three deep tracking off the first flight racing to the turn
and steadily faded nearing the lane. TICKET TO ALASKA tracked the leaders between foes in the second flight and steadily retreated racing into the turn.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN UPPER STRETCH BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

FLY NIGHTLY was rated just off the first flight inside a rival racing to the backstretch, lost some position awaiting a path racing into the far turn, swung out
four wide in upper stretch and produced a stout rally to just edge DANCERONTHEBEACH on the wire under firm handling. The latter tracked off the second
flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted three deep between foes gaining striking distance racing into the far turn, took over between calls
in late stages but couldn't contain the winner. INITFORTHELOVE, forwardly placed along the rail stalking just off the pacesetter, lost some position entering
the far turn, tipped out entering upper stretch, shifted three wide in the closing stages but continued with interest to prevail for a share. ROSE FOR A SAINT
settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, advanced four wide racing into the far turn to lodge a bid three deep between foes nearing the lane but lacked
the needed final kick. EVIDENCE raced four wide through the chute joining the pace, angled inwards entering the first turn while moving to gain the
advantage, set the pace on a clear margin along the inside to the far turn, maintained the advantage past midstretch but gave out late. IN HONOR OF
ARTIE tracked off the second flight along the inside in the opening half, switched out to race four wide into the far turn, was fanned five wide in upper stretch
and flattened out. DREAMIN OF SEVILLE settled between foes in the last flight and offered no rally. MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY, forwardly placed three wide in
the opening stages, tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight but faded early. THE RACE WAS DELAYED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AFTER
JUAN BOLY DISLODGED HIS RIDER AND RAN LOOSE ON THE COURSE, NECESSITATING A LATE SCRATCH.

Footnotes
CAPTIVANCE (IRE) broke readily to gain a forward placing along the rail racing through the chute, was rated in hand to stalk just off the first flight along the
inside racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide in upper stretch and produced a solid closing response to reel in RASTAFARA (IRE) in time under firm
handling. The latter broke readily, tracked just off the first flight racing three deep to the backstretch, commenced a steady advance in that path racing into
the far turn, went clear when given her cue in upper stretch, then grudgingly resisted the winner to the end to just miss. FATE OF OPHELIA, bumped from
both sides, then pinched back at the break, was collected to track off the second flight to the backstretch, was prompted to advance outside foes racing into
the far turn while being fanned four wide into the stretch but continued with a steady late effort to edge a rival for a share. TRANQUILLINA tracked off the
second flight outside a rival in the opening half, was prompted to gain some position between foes on the far turn, shifted out three wide racing into upper
stretch and continued with interest while just missing for a share. YOUENS sped to the lead from between foes, then angled to the rail once gaining the
advantage leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the far turn, dueled inside foes to upper stretch and gave way into the
lane. LULLABY LAND settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was fanned five wide entering upper stretch and gained some position
while making no real impression. LADY BLAKENEY was urged to terms prompting a rival's pace to the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes
entering the far turn and gave way entering the lane. BETTY GRABLE tracked off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch but steadily faded
after a half. DIAMOND SLEW broke outwards bumping FATE OF OPHELIA, was settled along the inside and failed to menace thereafter. ECLIPTICALS
DOLLY broke inwards bumping FATE OF OPHELIA, was righted to gain a position between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch but dropped out
abruptly after a half.

STOPIT tracked off the first flight between rivals racing through the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch, continued with a steady bid
to gain the advantage leaving the furlong marker and went clear under right handed pressure. HIMELSTEIN broke in bumping IMPERIAL PALACE, was
righted, then angled inwards to prompt the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch, moved to gain a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch
but proved no match when confronted by the winner while clearly best of the others. IFEELGOOD tracked the leaders inside rivals as part of the second
flight, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for a share. STARSHIP BUTLER, off slowly, settled along the inside in early
stages, saved ground through the turn, shifted off the inside entering the lane and improved position between foes to the end. EL FEFO, bumped at the
start, settled between foes off the second flight racing to the turn and continued with an even effort to gain some position three deep between rivals in the
closing stages. REACTION TIME, urged to dispute the pace racing a bit off the rail through the backstretch, dueled inside foes through the turn and gave
way midstretch. IMPERIAL PALACE, bumped at the start, tracked off the first flight racing four wide to the turn and faded nearing the lane. KHOZANITO,
urged to a forward placing four wide in the opening quarter, faded after a half. ODESSA GOLD, caught five wide racing through the backstretch, dropped
back early. ERIN GO BRAUGH broke outwards bumping EL FEFO, was held up between foes and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
CATSOUTOFTHEBAG tracked off the first flight outside rivals racing five wide to the turn, shifted inwards to bid four wide for command leaving the midway
point of the bend, wrested the advantage racing into upper stretch and HERE COMES JACKIE to the end under firm handling. The latter tracked just off the
first flight along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out five wide in upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap nearing the wire. BLIP SAYS BYE
was settled off the second flight while angling inwards racing into the bend, gathered momentum while swinging out six wide in upper stretch and found her
best stride late to gain terms with the top pair nearing the wire. DANCE OR STROLL was urged inside rivals disputing the pace, saved ground to upper
stretch to contest the issue into the lane but weakened in late stages. FIFTYSHADESOGRAYCE broke outwards bumping GREY JAZMINE, was urged
three deep pressing the pace into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. BONITA ANNIE tracked off the first flight three deep between foes, shifted out
on the turn, was fanned seven wide into the lane and passed only tiring rivals. BAND SWEETHEART, urged between foes disputing the pace, gave way into
upper stretch. GREY JAZMINE, bumped, then shuffled back at the start, failed to menace thereafter. SOME SAY SO tracked just off the first flight four wide
racing to the turn, was fanned five wide nearing upper stretch and quickly came up empty. RAKI tracked off the first flight between foes, raced wide into the
turn and soon emptied out.
