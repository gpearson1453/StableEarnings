Footnotes
CAPTIVANT angled to the inside early tracking off the first flight, steadily advanced along the inside through the backstretch, switched outside the
pacesetter while moving to challenge that rival nearing upper stretch, was carried out entering the lane but continued with a steady effort to wrest command
and go clear under left handed pressure. JUST A BIT SASSY, reluctant to load in the gate, was urged to the lead outside foes racing into the first turn, set
the pace racing off the rail to the far turn, drifted out entering upper stretch while being roused to resist the winner's challenge but couldn't contain that rival
while holding gamely for the place honors. MOMENTS TO SAVER tracked off the first flight outside rivals racing to the backstretch, was caught four midway
through the backstretch while being prompted to advance, shifted inside the leaders racing into upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair.
WHISPERING ROSE, restless in the post parade, settled off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted three wide on the far turn and continued
evenly. MINEWELLRECEIVED tracked off the first flight between foes into the backstretch, shifted in on the far turn and gave way into the stretch.
ATHENASWAY settled last along the inside early and failed to menace. CHIQUI THE GRAY, urged to a forward placing along the, shifted out after a half
and gave way.

Footnotes
BROADWAY, bumped at the start, recovered quickly to gain terms with a rival attending the pace while shifting to the three path nearing the backstretch,
continued on terms with the leaders three deep through the backstretch, shifted inwards on the far turn while moving to press the issue outside a rival
nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage in the closing stages and went clear under firm handling. LAST INVESTMENT broke outwards bumping the
eventual winner, was quickly righted to prompt the pace along the rail into the first turn, edged forward between calls racing into the far turn, resisted the
winner's bid past midstretch but proved only second best. HACHURE shifted a bit off the inside tracking just off the first flight inside a rival racing to the
backstretch, angled outside foes racing into the stretch and continued with late interest to gain some position. DYNABLUE exchanged brushes with the
eventual winner at the start, was prompted to a forward placing tracking just off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was urged to lodge a
brief bid nearing upper stretch but quickly came up. SOME MO angled inwards in the opening stages, then was prompted to split the leaders entering the
first turn to press the pace on a narrow advantage to the backstretch and gave way abruptly entering the far turn. NEFARIOUS FELLA settled last to the
backstretch and offered no rally.

Footnotes
ROSE FOR A SAINT settled inside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, swung out entering the far turn, advanced on the leaders racing five wide
into upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to prevail in time under firm encouragement. RED HOOD, forwardly placed along the inside
stalking the pacesetter, switched outside that rival on the backstretch, moved to press the issue nearing upper stretch, struck the front between calls late but
couldn't contain the winner. DISCO'S BRIDGE, urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail into the backstretch, set the pace to upper stretch and was collared
late. SURVEY (IRE) tracked off the first flight inside foes under light rating, saved ground to upper stretch, was urged to advance inside foes bidding for
command midstretch but was outkicked. ESTILO PELIGROSO, caught four wide racing into the first turn as part of the second flight, tracked the leaders
outside foes and improved position five wide in late stages. SWIFT KID, shuffled out of tight quarters at the start, pulled his way through close quarters to
gain a position just off the second flight, was prompted to make a early move advanced three deep between foes racing into the far turn to gain striking
distance but came up empty in the drive. ANALYZEYOURVISION, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, was fanned four wide
on the far turn and gave way. SANTO, held up out of tight quarters, then steadied leaving the chute avoiding DIVINE CONTROL while shifting into the path
of ADIOAS BOBBY, was righted to track the pace in second flight three wide between foes into the backstretch but steadily faded nearing the lane. DIVINE
CONTROL broke outwards bumping SWIFT KID, was held up between foes while ducking outwards leaving the chute impeding rivals and dropped back
early. ADIOS BOBBY, caught in tight quarters, then forced out leaving the chute, soon dropped out then trailed well off the field.

NOWITNA RIVER, angled to the inside early dropping off the first flight, saved ground through the turn, shifted off the inside gathering late momentum to bid
between rivals and narrowly prevailed under firm left handed pressure. EXCEED THE GOAL was settled last shifting outside foes on the backstretch, swung
four wide racing into upper stretch, rallied outside foes to challenge for command leaving the sixteenth marker and was just outkicked. NOTHINS FREE,
forwardly placed along the rail, asserted herself in the second furlong to gain a clear advantage racing into the turn, held sway past midstretch but faltered
late. GLORY ROLL, in touch with the pacesetter prompting that rival, continued in pursuit to upper stretch and gave way. SIDEPOCKET BET settled outside
foes dropping off the first flight, then continued three wide between foes into the stretch but had no rally. MZ. FOO DO, urged to brief contention four wide
on the backstretch, emptied out early. TEE UP tracked just off the first flight nearest the inside in the opening quarter but dropped out early.

nearing midstretch and went clear under firm handling. SELFMADE angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing to the first turn, steadily
advanced to contention inside foes after a half, shifted out on the far turn advancing on the pacesetter, was fanned three wide leaving midstretch and
prevailed for second. CURLEE FOX, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the leaders racing to the backstretch, was fanned four wide into the
lane and continued with interest to gain position. DRAMATIC KITTEN, urged along the inside prompting a rival's pace, wrested the advantage after a half,
went clear into the far turn but failed to sustain that momentum nearing midstretch. SWEET GIANT worked his way to the inside tracking off the second
flight racing to the backstretch, continued inside foes into the far turn but had no closing bid. STOPIT, urged to forced the pace outside a rival to the
backstretch, gave way into upper stretch. CALOGERO settled well back early and proved no threat. TIDES OF WAR shifted off the inside racing as part of

turn to loom outside the leaders four wide in upper stretch, then took over shifting inwards under pressure while going clear. VAN KHOZAN tracked off the
first flight, four wide, then three deep into the backstretch, steadily advanced to challenge three deep nearing upper stretch, gained the advantage
midstretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. SOUTH HOUSE, urged to dispute the pace while angling to the inside racing to the first
turn, dueled for command inside rivals to upper stretch and gave way late. WILL TAKE ROSES tracked the leaders between foes, then along the inside in
second flight racing to the far turn, shifted out four wide racing into the lane but had no closing bid. PRETTY PRISCILLA was urged forcing the pace outside
a rival, dueled for command on the far turn to upper stretch and gave way. PRAY FOR RAIN, caught four wide early, angled in to track off the second flight,
continued four wide through the far turn and lacked a rally. MY OWN PASSION settled along inside racing to the first turn, angled out five wide nearing the

Footnotes
PRINCIPLED STAND (GB) broke readily to join the pace three deep leaving the chute, went clear on his own courage racing into the backstretch while
angling nearer to the inside, dictated the pace in hand to the far turn, widened when given his cue racing into upper stretch and continued to draw away
while being gathered up approaching the wire. GROWL TIGER broke readily, was prompted to gain a forward placement along the inside tracking the the
pacesetter as part of the second flight, was urged along the inside in pursuit of that rival into upper stretch but proved no match while lasting for the place
honors. SOLDIERS SON, shuffled back out of tight quarters at the start, settled outside a rival to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while caught
four wide racing into the far turn and continued in that path to late stages while continuing to improve position. ALONZO MOSELY, caught in close quarters
three wide between foes leaving the chute, was prompted to make brief progress between foes into the far turn to lodge a bid nearing upper stretch but
came up empty in the drive. ANDRETTI, reluctant to load, was shuffled back avoiding traffic leaving the chute, continued between foes just off the second
flight racing to the far turn and had no closing bid while finishing evenly. SECLUDE settled near the inside racing to the backstretch and passed only tiring
rivals late. ON THE LIPS was prompted through close quarters leaving the chute to gain a forward placing between rivals in second flight racing to the the
backstretch and steadily faded into the far turn. IT'S ME AGAIN broke inwards bumping RED BARI, was then carried out by that foe racing into the first turn,
shifted in nearing the backstretch to make some brief progress three deep after a half but emptied out between foes on the far turn. RED BARI, bumped at
the start, was prompted to terms with the second flight four wide leaving the chute, bore out racing into the first turn impeding IT'S ME AGAIN and soon
dropped out.

HAUNTEDBYTHEMUSIC broke readily to force the pace outside a rival on a narrow advantage racing through the backstretch, shifted out three deep on the
turn disputing the issue between foes nearing upper stretch but continued with a steady effort to dispatch several challengers and go clear late under firm
handling. EXPENSIVE STYLE was urged inside the eventual winner from the outset prompting that rival while angling inwards dueling for command a bit off
the inside, conceded some position nearing the turn, then was urged to press the issue between foes inside the eventual winner to upper stretch but yielded
to that rival in late stages. UNCORK THE BOTTLE, held up between foes momentarily when caught in close quarters three deep in second flight racing
through the backstretch, shifted out four wide nearing the turn while being prompted to advance, moved to challenge in that path nearing upper stretch but
couldn't match the top pair while continuing evenly in the closing stages to prevail for a share. ANANROAD, urged inside foes tracking off the first flight,
advanced along the rail on the turn to lodge a brief bid inside foes nearing upper stretch but flattened out entering the lane. KALU tracked the leaders
between foes in second flight, conceded some position racing into the turn and couldn't produce a closing bid. I AM THAT I AM, caught four wide between
foes in the opening stages, was collected after clipping heels with EXPENSIVE STYLE racing through the backstretch and steadily faded into upper stretch.
MYSTIC LINK settled outside foes in the opening quarter and retreated early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF I AM THAT I AM LODGED A
CLAIM AGAINST THE RIDER OF EXPENSIVE STYLE FOR INTERENCE ON THE BACKSTRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
PRINCESS NINA broke readily, was rated off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half, was prompted to advance three wide racing into the far turn,
wrested the advantage in that path nearing upper stretch and drove clear. KITTEN WITH A WHIP was rated inside foes tracking well off the second flight in
the opening half, shifted out four wide entering the second bend while being prompted to advance, moved to challenge in that path in upper stretch but was
always only second best. TAP SOLO tracked off the first flight inside the eventual winner racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, shifted out
when lacking a path nearing upper stretch, angled five wide entering the lane and continued with an effort to gain position to the end. BARREL OF BLISS
sped to the lead along the rail racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch, dueled for command inside foes on the
far turn and gave way into the lane. DOUBLE DOT, caught four wide leaving the chute, dropped off the second flight to track three deep to the backstretch,
was fanned five wide into the lane but had no closing response. MAGESTAL BASTIDA broke awkwardly, was settled angling to the inside racing to the
backstretch, switched outside foes, then was fanned five wide wide into the lane but offered no rally. ONE LUCK GIRL settled outside foes racing to the first
turn and proved no threat. SECRET SARAH settled last early and never seriously menaced. PONZI was urged to terms prompting a rival's pace racing to
the backstretch, was urged to press the issue between foes entering the far turn but gave way between foes into the lane. PACKIN tracked off the second
flight between foes racing to the backstretch but retreated early.
