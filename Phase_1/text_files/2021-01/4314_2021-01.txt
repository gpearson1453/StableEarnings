Footnotes
DEALING JUSTICE away without apparent mishap, sparred for command with O'GOTTEN GIRL from path two, got cued up as their tussle spilled into the
stretch, forged its way to a slim lead during the ensuing furlong, saw the pesky second place finisher still battle onward but dug in well to preserve the
decision. O'GOTTEN GIRL cut over to the inside with the advantage, contended for the top matched up with the eventual winner, got roused coming into the
lane, yielded traversing through the furlong grounds, kept up the fight, but couldn't re-claim the top. MO DESSERTS saw within range of a contested pace
from path three, stepped into the lane having been switched to stronger handling, got staved off. DESPEIGHT ALL ODDS underwent a two wide pursuit,
fanned out into path four from upper to midstretch, lacked a response. BECCA'S WISH off approximately a length the tardiest after slamming into the left
side of the gate with significant force, failed to make her presence felt while saving ground throughout. QUICK TALKER brought up the back of the pack on
the backstretch, was just off the rail taking up the chase on the turn, tipped out into path two for the commencement of the stretch run, had no offering.

Footnotes
BAD GUY brushed the near side stall at the start, chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping three wide through the turn placed to coaxing
at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, closed well outside to get up in the final jumps to the finish. NOT THAT BRADY broke out at the start
trading a bump with SMILE BRYAN who broke inwards, came under coaxing and dueled from the two path with BEND IN THE RIVER to his inside, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive clinging to the lead through the final furlong and was nailed in the last
strides to the wire. FINANCIALSTABILITY chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun just off the inside for home, offered up a mild kick closing inside and missed at the end. COMPLEXIFIER hustled from the gate, chased four wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued four wide for home, kept on through the stretch to the finish but was outkicked. BEND IN THE RIVER
coaxed from the gate, dueled inside of NOT THAT BRADY coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. DUBAI BOBBY chased three wide coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and
weakened in the late going. QIAN B C broke a half a beat slow, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide
for home and offered no response. SMILE BRYAN broke in at the start trading a bump with NOT THAT BRADY who broke outwards, chased four paths off
the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing three furlongs out, went three wide into upper stretch
and made no impact.

Footnotes
BLITCHTON LADY in hand disputing the pace from path two on the backstretch, slid onto the inside route the top of the turn, continued along rated on a
loosely-contested advantage, got cued up approaching the three-sixteenths pole, responded and kicked well clear. FAIR REGIS a forward factor at or near
the rail until the end of the bend, was under a drive taking path two for entrance into the stretch, got outkicked. FAIR LASSIE secured a prominent position
on the backstretch, travelled two to three wide on the turn, was more the latter coming into the stretch under a drive, lacked the necessary response. OK
HONEY two wide onto the turn, got sent out into path four for the stretch run, came up empty. VIP NATION strung out four wide on the bend, fanned out into
path five from upper to midlane, backed away. AWESOME ALANA spotted along the rail in short order, went on to save ground to no avail. DRAGONESS
chased the pace from path three, swung out into path four entering the stretch, never made her presence felt.

Footnotes
FUN FINDER got bumped at the start by LOVE ME TOMORROW, who recovered inwards from a stumble, and in turn brushed TRAPPED N MY MIND,
chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for
home, rallied to take command at the eighth pole, inched away under a drive to prevail. JASMINESQUE chased four paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a
mild kick to secure the place honors. SECRET ZAR chased just off the inside before tipping four wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and kicked on belatedly for the show honors. TRAPPED N MY MIND brushed at the start by FUN FINDER
due to pressure from LOVE ME TOMORROW, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, then went five wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, continued five wide for home and offered up a mild bid. EBO SPECIAL showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked
inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in and was collared a furlong out,
weakened in the late stages. APPRECIATE chased three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along three furlongs out, spun three
wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. FIRST DAWN chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and made no headway. LOVE ME TOMORROW stumbled badly at the start
pecking the ground and recovering inwards into FUN FINDER who in turn brushed TRAPPED N MY MIND, got coaxed along to chase four then three wide
forwardly placed, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, faded, went five to six wide into upper stretch and was eased through to the finish.

Footnotes
COFFEE BAR away well, closed the gap late on the backstretch, departed it towards the two path, moved when ready right around the three-eighths pole,
was still being confidently ridden spinning onto the head of the stretch, was inside the three-sixteenths pole when switched over to stronger handling, drew
off smartly. VALLARAND prompted the pace two to three wide, saw the winner take charge on the turn, shifted out into path four early during the drive,
proved no match. POP THE BUBBLY pursued the pace two wide on the turn, swung out four wide into the stretch, went on to secure the show. QUIET
TYPE saved ground for nearly three-quarters, tipped into the two path at the head of the stretch, bested the rest. STORMI CAT LADY failed to get involved
during a ground-saving journey. COSMIC KITTEN a forward factor three wide, folded. CAUMSETT disputed the pace from along the inside route for the
opening half, steadily retreated during the run around the bend, cut the corner protected and ventured onward thus so.

Footnotes
NYTHINGZPAZIBLE assumed the front end, cut over to the rail a sixteenth or so short of the half mile pole, eventually setting at a slight distance from off
the rail, slithered over into path three before getting called upon for more in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, saw the winner chipping away at the
deficit in the final furlong, held late to prevail. PAY GRADE perched three wide, swung out approximately one path wider into the stretch, settled in and was
given her cue, gained ground in a steadfast manner, missed. EPONA'S DREAM had the pilot grab hold after stumbling at the start, got guided over to the
rail prior to departing the chute, slipped to the outside springing from the five-sixteenths pole, angled wider and wider until five wide a furlong later, mustered
up a mild response to grab the show. DESTINATIONWNRSCIR underwent a four wide for nearly three-quarters pole, ducked in when given a solitary right
side shot in midstretch, resulting in being checked, found itself along the rail soon afterwards. flattened out. EXFILTRATION took up residence in midpack,
tipped into the two path by the top of the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the inside, gave way. PHOTOFINISH JEANNE forwardly placed,
stalked the pace two to three wide, was more in path three coming into the lane having been roused a sixteenth up the road, altered into path two a few
strides later, tired. FLOWER'S FORTUNE saved ground and faltered. SALUKI three to four wide onto the turn, displayed only brief speed.

Footnotes
PERFECT MUNNINGS three wide in closest aim of the duel up front, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive to take command a sixteenth from home, then edged away to the finish to prevail. STORM SHOOTER dueled along the inside of
LOOKIN FOR TROUBLE, shook off that rival briefly nearing the half mile pole before being engaged once more through the turn, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in heads apart for command to the sixteenth marker when collared in tandem by the top one,
then ran on to safely secure the place honors. LOOKIN FOR TROUBLE dueled from the two path down the backstretch, got shaken off a bit near the half
mile pole before advancing once more into the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole heads apart for command, spun just off the inside for home,
dug in trading the front with the aforementioned foe latched on until shaken off in the final sixteenth when weakening in the very late stages and was just
able to preserve the show honors on the wire. UNO chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home offered up a
mild bid to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late going and just missed for the show honors. WINDY NATIONS chased three then two wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position by tired rivals. BLUE GATOR four paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened. NEW
YORK ONE chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under a ride at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper
stretch and tired. HALPERT stumbled at the start veering inwards in recovery and was taken hold, came under coaxing and chased two to three wide from
the tail of the field, angled six wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
WISHES AND DREAMS away last after tossing its head about prior to being sprung from the starting gate, proceeded along in a sluggish manner on the
backstretch, got maneuvered into the three path coming up to the midway point on the turn, noticeably picked up interest a sixteenth down the road, angled
five wide into the lane, charged by the front runners, then drew off convincingly in the final furlong, under the mildest of drives. YES YOUR HONOR pursued
the pace two wide after losing her footing springing from the gate, was in the same path heading home, mustered up a response sufficient enough to be
along for the place. WOMEN NOT EASY moved into a prominent position in short order, cut over to the inside, vied for command matched up LUCKY
LINDSEY from the outside, pulling a bit on the bit, with the pilot aware of a rider-less foe in the vicinity all the while, continued to go at it under the same
scenario with LUCKY LINDSEY, checked when put in tight by a rider-less BASTET in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, recovered after a few
jumps and saw the rider go to work, wandered into the three path in upper stretch, proved powerless to hold off the top one, weakened into the show slot.
MIA CALIA four wide departing the backstretch, went into path six exiting the turn, made no impact en route for the final significant slice of the pot. LUCKY
LINDSEY got guided towards the two path after the start, raced teamed up with WOMEN NOT EASY, rider casting intermittent furtive glances at the loose
horse a short distance behind, ventured onward as a team with WOMEN NOT EASY once onto the turn, rider still glancing at the horse-without-a-rider, was
steadied when put in tight by that one right around the five-sixteenths pole, angled four wide after completing the rest of the way to the end of the bend,
backed away. HERE COMES MEG cut over to the rail after bumping with BASTET very shortly after the field had been sent on its way, rode it for nearly a
half, shifted three wide into the lane, had no offering. BASTET off cleanly, made contact with HERE COMES MEG right afterwards, then stumbled after
taking an awkward step, losing the rider in the process, unfortunately made her presence felt at intervals during the running of the race, was walked off after
being apprehended by an outrider. Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the incident right after the start, the result was allowed to stand and the race
was declared official.
