CHASIN MUNNY broke in and bumped rival, stalked outside the leader, applied pressure around the turn, dueled through the stretch and edged rival on the
line. CRUEL INTENTION showed early speed, set the pace inside of CHASIN MUNNY, met bid around the turn, dueled in the lane and was nailed at the
wire. SYMPHONIC bumped leaving the gate, steered to the inside, stalked along the rail to the stretch, moved out a bit in the lane and held the show.
TRIPOLI in range early, went three wide around bend and finished evenly outside of SYMPHONIC in the final furlong. SINGLE ME OUT chased the speed
from inside to the stretch and improved position. HOWBEIT traveled off the pace while outside a rival, took the turn two wide, was tight between rivals at the
quarter pole, then kept on in the final furlong. VANTASTIC off a bit slow to begin, raced outside a foe, three wide into the bend, angled into the two path,
steered inside in upper stretch and weakened. PREACHING TRAINER angled out early on the backstretch, went four wide through the turn and faded.

Footnotes
THE GREAT ONE stalked outside FENWAY early, drew alongside and headed rival at the five-sixteenths pole, quickly cleared, widened when shown a
right-handed whip to mid-stretch then ridden out to the wire. AFFABLE stumbled leaving the gate, tracked off the inside, ranged up three wide outside the
top pair on the far turn, could not match the winner in the drive but was clearly second best. THERE GOES HARVARD chased off the rail, ridden along up
the backstretch, asked around the far turn, lacked the needed response but was along for the show. FENWAY showed speed along the rail, set the pace up
the backstretch, headed by rival at the five-sixteenths pole and folded.

into the stretch, held a short lead to the eighth pole, lost command with a sixteenth to go and stayed on for a minor award. HONOS MAN broke out and
bumped rival leaving the gate, traveled along the inside to the stretch, waited for an opening in upper stretch, found room along the fence and finished

up the fence and gained the place. BEST OF SHOW settled early, took the turn five wide, showed a mild rally and gained the show. BIG AL'S PRINCESS
dueled for command inside rival or in the two path, lost command to the winner at the quarter pole, then weakened in the final furlong. SMART LOLA dueled
outside a rival up the backstretch, vied between around the turn then chased the winner into the stretch and also weakened. HERE COMES RALPHIE
entered the turn two wide, swung six wide into the stretch and was never a factor. LULU D' ORO raced outside rivals up the backstretch, took the turn four
wide and had little left when straightened away. FELICIDAD LEGADA broke in and bumped rival at the start, stalked three then four wide around the turn
