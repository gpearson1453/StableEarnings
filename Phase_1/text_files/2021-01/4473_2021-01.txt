MEMORY MAGIC raced within striking distance, moved up on the outside around the final turn, drove clear and was kept to the task. PANTERITA unhurried
in the early going, raced four wide around the final turn, rallied down the lane and was a clear second at the wire. MISS OCEAN EXPRESS raced within
contention and proved no match for the top two. MOONFIELD sprinted to the front, pulled away and tired early in the home stretch. MO GAYLE lacked early
speed and was never a threat.

Footnotes
SUMMER APPEAL lacked early speed, moved up outside around the final turn, made a bid, five wide and got up in time. ARTIST BY THE SEA unhurried in
the beginning, moved up four wide around the final turn, took the lead down the stretch, but hold off the winner at the wire. KING ZIPPY challenged for the
lead, dueled throughout, was outfinished by the top two, while putting forth a game effort. WRATH pressed the pace, made a mild bid, while racing close
throughout. APALACHEE BAY went to the front, drove clear and weakened. MUTINEER raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort.
VALLEY OF THE HIDE raced near the middle of the pack and never mounted a bid. SOUTHPINE GIFT raced within contention and faded. HOOK always
raced near the back and showed little. GASOLINA void of early speed and was outrun.
