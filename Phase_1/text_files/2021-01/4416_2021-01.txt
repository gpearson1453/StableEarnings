Footnotes
PUGIN achieved stalking position while shifting down to the three path around the first turn, bid for the lead turning for home, and drew off approaching the
final furlong. DUEL FUEL stalked along the inside, loomed large from the two path around the far turn as PUGIN got first turn, tipped three wide in upper
stretch to achieve place at the furlong marker while not keeping place with that rival, then just held that position from NO DRAMA late. NO DRAMA broke a
step slowly before being sent for early position, rushed to a forward position while floating a trio of foes wide into the first turn, shifted down to the three path
while between horses around that bend, but took back to midpack into the backstretch, came under a drive while five wide and outside of foes into the far
turn, but still sustained a grinding rally through the lane to just miss place. OPTIMISTIC VALOR tracked from midpack while shifting down from the five path
to the two path around the first turn, took the far turn three wide before swinging five wide turning for home, and rallied for a minor reward. YOUNG FLINT
saved ground off of the pace around the first turn, commenced a rally while aiming three wide at the quarter pole, but was outkicked to that spot by DUEL
FUEL turning for home, shifted back two wide to split foes in upper stretch, but was herded inwards to the rail path by PARTY OF NO in midstretch, taking
away NAVAJO CREED's path, then finished under a mild drive inside of PARTY OF NO to the wire. PARTY OF NO lied forwardly placed two wide while a
bit keen between rivals around the first turn, inched closer down the backstretch to vie around the far turn, forged an advantage at the quarter pole, but was
headed turning for home, drifted in while weakening in midstretch, and faded. ASSERT DOMINANCE saved ground forwardly placed around the first turn,
shifted two wide into the backstretch, then four wide into the far turn, but only managed to chased the leaders home. NAVAJO CREED lied far off of the
pace two wide, then along the inside around the far turn, commenced a rail rally turning for home, but was shut off in midstretch when PARTY OF NO
herded YOUNG FLINT into his path, steadied due to the incident, and was protected thereafter. CAN'T BE BROKEN got floated to the six path into the first
turn while far off of the pace, shifted down to the four path around that bend, then never got involved. JIMBO hesitated at the start, then got outrun.
THIRSTY'S PRIDE pulled forward into the first turn, cleared into the backstretch, vied inside of PARTY OF NO around the far turn, but caved in upper
stretch. PULL A FREDDIE was reluctant to load, then broke slowly, lied far off of the pace in the seven to five path around the first turn, and was done early.

and drew off under a drive. SENSE A MILLION pressed the early pace, bid between horses on the turn, reached a short lead after six furlongs, was no

finished evenly. ANTIGONE chased three wide to the turn, and gave way after six furlongs. MONEY FACTOR was outrun inside. SKYE SNOW bumped
with MAGICGIRL at the start, set the early pace inside, yielded to challengers on the turn, drifted wide into the stretch and jogged in.

Footnotes
ISLAND VIBE set the pace inside of ADDI, cleared away from that foe into the turn, then widened her advantage under driving pressure through the lane.
WATER WIZARD lied forwardly placed along the inside, shifted to the two path at the quarter pole to take aim on the clear leader, but failed to keep pace
with that rival in upper stretch, and held place. ADDI was brushed minorly by an inner foe at the start, lacked early speed and trailed the field, improved
position three wide around the turn, then stayed on through the lane to claim show late. TRINNI GIRLS broke a bit inwards, saved ground far off of the pace,
which allowed her to improve position turning for home, then chased the leaders through the lane before getting outfinished by an outer foe for show.
TWIRLING DERVISH lied off of the pace in the two path around the turn, got outmoved by ADDI for a minor placing turning for home, shifted four wide in
upper stretch, then failed to factor. EMPEROR'S SONG broke a bit outwardly, lied forwardly placed three wide, but weakened turning for home.
THEYCALLMEPRINCESS took minor bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, prompted the pace setter two wide, but weakened between horses

Footnotes
CHILL HAZE broke to the lead, gave his pursuers the slip around the turn, stayed on his left lead through the stretch and faced no challenges. HARPER GO
LUCKY raced in the second flight for a half-mile, swung five wide rallying into the stretch, and bested YES FOR LESS for the place. YES FOR LESS was
outsprinted early, came six wide into the lane, and was edged for second while best of the remainder. FIRST HOMESTEAD saved ground in range to the
stretch, and lacked a closing response. BARBIE'S KING was no factor inside. EL ZEUS was finished after a half. THE REIGN MAN chased three wide early,
and faltered before reaching the stretch. CAPTAIN DUKE pressed the pace outside, and had nothing left into the lane. PRICEY VICTORY broke slowly and
was never close.

Footnotes
FEATURE CREATURE lied far off of the pace two wide, gained position down the backstretch, rallied three wide around the far turn to bid for the lead
outside of REAL DOOZIE at the quarter pole, dueled with that foe through the lane, prevailed in the battle in the late stages, and just held from an
oncharging YAKO. YAKO tracked from midpack two wide, allowed the eventual winner to outmove her down the backstretch, took the far turn three wide
while creeping closer, then produced a rally through the lane to bid outside of the dueling leaders approaching the wire, but missed. REAL DOOZIE vied
along the inside of DIXIE PRINCESS through a fast pace around the first turn, allowed that foe to clear off into the backstretch, stalked from the two path
before rebidding for the lead inside of FEATURE CREATURE at the quarter pole, dueled gamely inside of that foe through the lane, but was bested in the
battle and got nailed on the wire for place. FANTASTIC KINGDOM saved ground far off of the pace along the inside, gained ground four wide around the far
turn before being floated five wide turning for home, then sustained a mild rally through the lane. ISADORABLE AIDA tracked from midpack along the
inside, then two wide around the far turn, but was outkicked by outer foes in upper stretch, and chased the leaders home. MISS JEN saved ground far off of
the pace around the first turn, took the far turn four wide before swinging six wide turning for home, and stayed on. AGUAS COLORADAS saved ground off
of the pace, had to await racing room behind foes around the far turn while getting outmoved by outer rivals, swung four wide entering the lane, but lacked a
rally. GENERIC MARK trailed in the two path around the first turn, lied far off of the pace along the inside around the far turn, but failed to factor. DANCE
TILL DAWN stalked along the inside around the first turn, but faded around the far turn before steadying turning for home. DIXIE PRINCESS vied three to
two wide around the first turn through a fast pace, cleared off into the backstretch, but met a pair of bids at the quarter pole and weakened. PASSION PLUS
lied forwardly placed along the inside around the first, turn, but weakened at the half mile pole, was eased thereafter, and got vanned off.

Footnotes
NO COMMISSION rushed up inside after the start, shook off pursuers around the turn, entered the stretch in the two-path and was driving to remain well
clear. GOLDEN TONE lagged far back inside early, swung four wide into the lane, and was up outside R KING KONG for the place. R KING KONG chased
after the battling leaders three wide into the turn, made no headway on NO COMMISSION into the stretch, and was overhauled for second. CURVE broke
slowly, came three wide off the turn, and lacked a closing bid. MIDNIGHT TEQUILA failed to threaten three wide. COMPASS CAY was finished early inside.
WEIGHT OF GLORY pressed the early pace outside the winner, had nothing left after a half-mile and jogged in far behind.

Footnotes
MID DAY IMAGE set the pace along the inside, established a loose advantage around the first turn, met MY POINT EXACTLY's and YAMATO's bids
turning for home, but repelled those foes in upper stretch, scooted clear, then steadily drifted out many paths through the lane while holding sway. YAMATO
broke outwardly, rated off of the pace in the three path around the first turn, rallied four wide around the far turn to bid for the lead passing the quarter pole,
but was repelled in upper stretch, chased the leader through the lane as that foe drifted out, and proved second best. HIGH NOON RIDER lied at the rear of
the field along the inside around the first turn, took the far turn three to four wide while gaining mildly, then sustained his kick through the lane to rally for a
minor share. GOOD OLD BOY tracked from midpack two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, but only managed to chase the leaders home.
MY POINT EXACTLY stalked two wide, bid for the lead around the five sixteenths grounds, vied between horses turning for home, but failed to keep pace
with them in upper stretch, and faded. LOOKIN AT ROSES tracked from midpack along the inside, inched closer three wide under a drive around the far
turn, but faded turning for home. BELGRANO stalked along the inside, but failed to produce a bid, and weakened. ROCKET JOE COPPER hesitated at the
start, lied at the rear of the field three to two wide around the first turn, attempted a rally three to four wide around the far turn, but lacked a kick through the
lane to sustain it. DANVILLE saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. ZIPPY lied far off of the pace in the two path, and never got involved.

Footnotes
ANGELCENTS dashed clear after the start, showed the way slightly off the inside to the stretch, and remained in command on her left lead. SONG RIVER
bumped with DOUBLE MEDAL at the start, chased after the winner from the outset, entered the stretch in the two-path and ran on gamely outside WAR
STAR to take second. WAR STAR raced forwardly two wide around the turn, moved inside for the drive and was outfinished for the place. FOLLOW ME
MOM saved ground to the stretch, and lacked the needed response. MISS MIAMI raced three wide and failed to menace through an even effort. NIKEE
KAN got off to a stutter-step start behind the field, steadied toward the back near the quarter-pole, and posed no threat. DISTINCTLY BLUE raced four then
three wide around the turn, and could not reach contention. DOUBLE MEDAL bumped with SONG RIVER at the start, steadied near the back attempting to
get through between horses a quarter-mile out, and made no late gains. THINKIN COWTOWN was outrun three to four wide.

Footnotes
UNTITLED set the pace inside of four pressing foes down the backstretch, inched away from them into the turn, met WHYRUAWESOME's bid turning for
home, but repelled him in upper stretch, kicked clear, then safely held from GIROLAMO'S ATTACK's late charge. GIROLAMO'S ATTACK lied off of the
pace along the inside, shifted to the four path into the turn, rallied with good kick through the lane, but ran out of ground to catch the leader. ARHAM hopped
at the start and was off slowly, got hustled to improve early position, shifted from the five path to the three path into the turn while still off of the pace, but
kicked in around the five sixteenths pole, attempted a bid passing the three sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, and
leveled off. WHYRUAWESOME pressed five wide early on, then just two wide around the turn, inched closer to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but was
turned away between horses in upper stretch, and faded. READY TO ANSWER trailed early on, took the turn in the four path while far off of the pace, and
failed to factor. DOC AMSTER got fractious in the gate, pressed the pace two wide and between horses early on, failed to keep pace passing the half mile
pole, then steadied inside of the tiring SAGAMORE MISCHIEF at the seven sixteenths pole, and failed to make an impact thereafter. SAGAMORE
MISCHIEF pressed the pace three wide and between horses early on, but weakened into the turn, and was done early. ROYAL SQUEEZE chased four
wide and between horses while close up to the pace early on, sustained chasing position from the two path around the turn, but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
K'S RUNNING FREE broke slowest and was outrun to the stretch two wide, kicked in past the eighth-pole and was along in time outside rivals.
SEAMIALAUGH bumped with IMHAVINAVERYGOODAY at the start, waited for an opening around the turn two wide, came clear into the stretch, and
finished with good courage between horses. MIAHSOLOMIAH cleared off and moved inside entering the turn, maintained a daylight advantage to deep
stretch but could not hold on. MAMA LONGLEGS vied early inside MIAHSOLOMIAH, stayed on the chase to the stretch, and weakened through the late
stages. SASSY CAT lacked a rally two wide. WINNIPEG WONDER played no part three then two wide around the turn. LIVIN AT THE BEACH broke
slowly, and was outrun four wide. PRINCESS MERIDA raced wide and was never a factor. HOITY TOITY was outrun inside. IMHAVINAVERYGOODAY
bumped with SEAMIALAUGH at the start, stayed in range four to three wide around the turn, and tired. ST. LOUIE ARCH raced far back inside. BLESSING
MEMORIES raced three wide and was through after three furlongs.
