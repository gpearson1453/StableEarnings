up, drifted in and was best. PURELY POLITICAL was unhurried early, advanced seven wide through the turn , was no match late and finished second best.
SURPRSINGLYPERFECT was void of speed, went four wide into the second turn and offered a mild late rally. KONA COAST set the early pace, went four
wide into the second turn, couldn't sustain and weakened. CIMPL MAN was allowed to settle early, was rushed to contend the pace, went three wide into
the second turn and faded. AOTEAROA chased the early pace, went five wide into the second turn and tired. MOST DETERMINED was outrun early, went
three wide into the second turn and never fired.

Footnotes
SUPER CAT SPEED set a clear early pace, went four wide through both turns, opened up, drifted out late stretch and held for the win. POINT OF IMPACT
was unhurried early, circled eight wide through the turn, raced far wide through the stretch, was closing late and finished second best. DANDY VAN was
void of speed, raced between rivals into the home turn, was gaining late and needed more ground. IRISH CHARLIE raced in mid pack early, made a middle
move along the backstretch, angled out six wide through the second turn and flattened out. PAUL'S DIVA was taken back early, went four wide into the turn,
angled in and offered no rally. SMILING MATT was allowed to settle early, raced three wide into the second turn and weakened late stretch. GEORGIAN
ROAD tracked the early pace, went seven wide into the second turn and was empty. FIELD GENERAL chased the early pace and was finished early.
