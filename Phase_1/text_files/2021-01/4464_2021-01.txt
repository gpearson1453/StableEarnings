Footnotes
DEPUTY INDY bumped with HONOR FACTOR at the start and was outrun early, got maneuvered out four wide picking up steam near the quarter-pole,
rallied to overhaul AMERICAN MATTERS from outside with a sixteenth remaining, and drew clear. AMERICAN MATTERS sped clear early inside, settled
into the stretch well in command, could not withstand the winner but was best of the others. UNLONELY raced two to three wide around the turn in midpack,
and was up outside for show. THE KING AQUILES stayed close four then three wide around the turn, and lacked a solid closing response between horses.
MASTER Q came away alertly despite hitting the left side of the gate, saved ground and lacked a rally. AESTHETICALLY broke slowly, swung five wide
leaving the turn, and made no impact. ANDRES EDUARDO was no factor two to three wide. ROYAL BIZ chased the pacesetter between horses early, and
tired after three furlongs. EXTRACTION WILL hit the left side of the gate and broke slowest, lagged far back to the stretch, and swerved to avoid a stricken
rival near the eighth-pole. HONOR FACTOR bumped with DEPUTY INDY at the start, came five wide off the turn and could not gain. RUB MY BELLY
chased early inside, went wrong suffering a catastrophic injury to the right front entering the stretch and was vanned off.

GEGE CONQUEST was isolated around the turn tracking the leaders, rallied to overtake HEAVENLY BLESSING entering the final furlong, and drew clear
staying on his left lead. HEAVENLY BLESSING broke in bumping KING TARZAN, crossed over with the early lead inside, edged away coming to the
quarter-pole, yielded to the winner past the furlong marker and held the place. BARREL PROOF pressed HEAVENLY BLESSING from outside to the
stretch, and lacked a final rally. COMMUNICATION FAIL got bumped between horses at the start, raced three wide and failed to seriously menace.
HANGAR ONE got bumped by COMMUNICATION FAIL at the start, saved ground and posed no threat. KING TARZAN was bumped into
COMMUNICATION FAIL by HEAVENLY BLESSING at the start, and was outrun four wide. PELUCHIN CHIN was a step slow coming out, and tired early
two wide.

TODAYSTHEDAY stalked the pace two wide, seized command near the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. ALADO tracked the pace three wide, could
not match strides with the winner in upper stretch but stayed on well enough to last for the place. HIGH YIELD KITTEN lacked early speed, saved ground
around the turn, tipped out in upper stretch, rallied between rivals and just missed second. LOYAL LOUIE veered out at the start, set the pace along the rail,
was collared near the quarter pole and faded under minimal urging while appearing to try to get out through the lane. LADIES' CHOICE was shut off at the
start, raced off the pace inside, made good progress at the rail in upper stretch and faded through the final furlong. MILITARY DRILL raced off the pace two
wide, angled four wide nearing the lane and lacked the needed rally. COACH PAUL had early speed three wide and faded around the turn. JACOHARE was
outrun while racing two wide.

SENGEKONTACKET raced close up inside for six furlongs, came two wide into the stretch, darted back to the rail coming to the eighth-pole and got past
RECIPROCAL to prove best late. RECIPROCAL grabbed the lead after the start, set an even pace slightly removed from the rail, could not fend off
SENGEKONTACKET through the late stages and settled for second best. BASELINE DRIVE saved ground at the back early, began moving three then four
wide approaching the stretch, and was up outside AWESOME ELLA to get the show. AWESOME ELLA crept closer to the leaders along the inside after six
furlongs, attempted a rail bid but was beaten to the spot by SENGEKONTACKET and steadied a furlong out, moved off the inside and was outfinished for
third. SO ELUSIVE raced two wide around the turns, and lacked the needed closing response. CAT LADY pressed the pace outside, and faded after six
furlongs. A LOOKER was never prominent inside. ZOOLOGY raced three wide in striking range early, and tired into the stretch. GALWAY CITY hopped at
the break and came out slowest, raced three wide early, tired in the stretch and was vanned off after the finish. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO
THE STRETCH RUN BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

IRISH HONOR stalked the pace three wide, slowly gained through the lane and was up late. SIR OLLIE prompted the pace two wide, took the lead near the
five-sixteenths pole, led to deep stretch but could not withstand the winner. THE ICE BEAST was pulling hard while saving ground through the opening half,
angled four wide nearing the eighth pole, lacked a rally but was along for the show. BEASTER set the pace along the rail and tired in the lane. FAMOUS
GENT chased the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane.

FREE TO FLY advanced three wide through the run around the turn, rallied to collar DAHLONEGA from outside with a furlong remaining and edged away
under pressure. LAVI broke slowly and was outrun early inside, angled five wide leaving the turn, and finished well to get up for second on the far outside.
DAHLONEGA set the pace in the two-path, moved inside approaching the stretch, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile. IMA DAREDEVIL shifted
out four wide late on the turn, and ran on one-paced through the lane. SAMMIE SUNSHINE hustled up inside to press the early pace, and weakened after a
half-mile. WORTH AVENUE was outrun two to three wide. WORDS OF DEVINE moved out five wide approaching the stretch, and could not reach
contention. PROSPECTIVE DIVA broke slowly, saved ground and was always outrun. MIDTOWN ROSE pursued outside the early leaders three wide, and
was through soon after completing a half.

Footnotes
MEADE raced off the early pace outside, made strong progress three wide around the turn, inhaled the pacesetter turning for home, drew clear in upper
stretch and just held off the runner-up's late charge inside. PLEASE SIT DOWN settled off the pace outside, raced three wide around most of the turn,
angled in nearing the lane, closed inside and just missed. BRASSTOWN sped to the front, set the pace in the two path well clear of the field but with the
loose horse several lengths in front at the rail, was collared turning for home and weakened inside. CANDY CRUSHEM chased the pace three wide and
finished evenly. IL FARAONE was outrun inside. UNMATCHABLE had early speed two wide, stopped and was eased. ROBINTAKINCHARGE stumbled
badly and lost the rider at the start, ran off in front of the field, completed the course riderless well in front of the field and walked off. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START, RULED THAT ROBINTAKINGCHARGE CAUSED HIS OWN TROUBLE AND TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
KASIM tracked from easy striking range two then three wide, rallied steadily through the stretch, caught ENSIGN PARKER from outside and pulled clear
late. THINKABOUTIT vied early inside UNDER THE COUVERS and ENSIGN PARKER, took back entering the turn, came off the rail through the furlong
grounds to go around UNDER THE COUVERS, moved back inside and finished well to get up for the place. ENSIGN PARKER vied early outside, edged
away turning for home, remained clear past the eighth-pole, could not resist the winner a sixteenth out, and was nailed late for second. ZAMFIR failed to
threaten through an even effort near the two-path. UNDER THE COUVERS vied inside ENSIGN PARKER going to the turn, got shaken off after three
furlongs, and faded through the drive. THIRD TIME AROUND broke out at the start, and was no menace three wide. TIMEWON'TLETMEGO hit the left side
of the gate and came out slowest, and trailed inside.

outside and was up in deep stretch. SANDRA'S MINE saved ground in midpack, went three wide around the far turn, rallied between rivals through the lane,
took the lead in deep stretch but was outkicked. GINGERONMYMIND was in range three wide, bid between rivals in midstretch but evened out late.
