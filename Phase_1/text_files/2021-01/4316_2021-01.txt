stretch in the two path under a drive then moved further out around the furlong marker, gained into the final sixteenth and just missed while able to get the
place. M V P MOOKIE raced in the three path on the first turn, was reserved under a tight hold, came under some urging late on the backstretch, dropped in
with three furlongs to run, was ridden along while inside to the two path on the far turn then driven three wide into the stretch, moved out around the furlong
marker then drifted out in the vicinity of the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly for the show. AWESOME PARTY went to the front, raced inside on the first
turn, set the pace with some company to his outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive in upper
stretch and was outfinished. V MAN broke near the back of the field, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, was rated off the pace then let out late on
the backstretch, went three then four wide under urging on the far turn, turned five wide into the stretch under the whip, drifted out outside the sixteenth-pole

Footnotes
CAVIAR RESOLUTION broke a step slow, settled towards the rear under some urging, went three wide under stronger encouragement early on the turn,
shifted four wide over heels at the five-sixteenths, drifted in turning into upper stretch, rallied under a right-handed whip and closed strongly to win going
away. TIZ A QUEEN was hustled to the lead and set the pace, extended the advantage while inside on the turn, lugged inward in upper stretch then was
given one crack of a right-handed whip, remained clear into the final furlong, switched to a left-handed whip at that point, led to the sixteenth-pole then was
overtaken and proved no match for the winner but held the place. STACEYS RACEY broke out at the start, chased the pace on the outside then in the three
path on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. BREST FORTRESS was off slow then came
outward, raced well back in the field, went four then five wide on the turn and failed to threaten. DARE TO HOPE broke out at the start, dropped back under
urging on the outside, went three wide on the turn and faltered. TIZ FOR REAL bobbled slightly at the start, was urged along off the pace, saved ground on
the turn and also faltered.

Footnotes
CAJUN UP bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along towards the front, chased in the two path on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, gained
on the outside under the whip, took the advantage into the final furlong and drew clear under strong urging. NO QUARTER was brushed in the hindquarters
at the start, raced off the pace while ridden along, advanced four wide on the turn, made a bid passing the five-sixteenths, took the lead while five wide into
the stretch then dropped inward, was headed by the winner into the final furlong and proved no match while just able to hold the place. FLASHBURN was
urged along off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch, held a good striking position while outside into the final
furlong but lacked the needed kick and just missed the place while clear for the show. IMPRESSIVE GREELY bumped with a rival at the start then was
taken up, was reserved early then settled well off the pace, went three to four wide under urging on the turn, gained while moving out some into upper
stretch, dropped in under a drive around the furlong marker, moved in more coming to the sixteenth-pole and flattened out. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT broke out
and bumped with a rival, was urged along at the rear, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch and was no factor.
WENDY'S WILL bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went five wide on the turn, came six
wide into the stretch and had nothing left. LOUISIANA JAZZ was sent hard to the lead, set the clear pace, raced inside on the turn, was challenged outside
the five-sixteenths then headed into the stretch and faded. KING LIAM chased the pace on the outside three wide on the turn, made a bid outside the
five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and retreated. SPECIAL STORM was urged along towards the rear, went around the turn in the two path
and failed to respond. R W 'S RETIREMENT veered out at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, was urged along on the outside, went
six wide on the turn and failed to respond.
