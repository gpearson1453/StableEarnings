Footnotes
CONQUEST LEMONRAID was away in good order then hustled along to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the
three-eighths pole and drew off through the lane with complete authority. SPEED SAVER steadied soon after the start, raced unhurried early, moved
three-wide through the second turn, angled out further nearing the three-eighths pole and finished with good energy. IMPLICITLY pressed the pace while
racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive. TIZ EMMA raced four-wide through the first turn, showed no early speed, saved ground through
the second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly. REY COLIMAN lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out
nearing the three-sixteenths pole and was not a factor. THE REF pressed the pace while racing three-wide from between foes and weakened after going
three-quarters. ON THE WINGS OF settled off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
ATLANTIC STRIKE sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch and held sway to the wire.
RANGER MOLLY broke sharply to chase the winner throughout, could not gain on that rival in the drive but was clearly second best. SHE'S A LIL FLIRT
was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached a contending position but lacked the needed late response. ROCKA DOCKA NOLA
was off slow and hopped, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, reached a contending position and finished evenly late. NORTHERN GEM
lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not menace. LIFE IN PARADISE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn
and weakened. SAYITALL was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten. Due to a timer malfunction internal fractions were
omitted.

NICE AND TRUE was away alertly to duel for the lead from the outside with PLEASE ZIP IT, disposed of that rival after going a half, opened a clear lead
into the lane and was ridden out to increase that advantage. ICE KITTY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached
a striking position into the stretch, was no match for the winner but finished well to regain the place. MY THREE KIDS settled off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the turn, offered a bid in mid-stretch but failed to sustain her rally. PLEASE ZIP IT dueled for the lead from the inside, could not stay with
the winner after going a half and gave way. RANDOM PLEASURE showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch
and finished with a belated bid. CHARMING LASS raced off the pacesetters early, reached a contending position into the lane and lacked the needed
closing response. SHAWNEE PASS raced off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled in slightly approaching the stretch and failed to
rally. GIFTY was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
BEE EINSTEIN broke sharply to stalk the pace of MIA SOLINA while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that rival nearing the three-sixteenths pole,
vied and edged away through the closing yards. GREY ABBEY settled off the leaders from between foes, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out in
mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner late. MIA SOLINA sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, responded when challenged by
the winner into the lane, vied with that rival and gave way grudgingly late. FRENCH TUDOR lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, was
bumped in mid-stretch and finished willingly when straightened away. PERFECT EDITION was off a step slow then allowed to settle, raced five-wide
through the turn and finished with a belated bid. CHRIS IS READY settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, checked nearing the
sixteenth pole and finished well when clear. CLOCHARD STREET chased the leaders while racing four-wide, drifted out through the lane, bumped with
FRENCH TUDOR in mid-stretch, continued to drifted out and was not urged late. ON THE VERGE showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the
turn and did not menace. PACIFIC SILENCE raced off the leaders from the inside, steadied nearing the quarter and did not threaten thereafter. LIS LA
VICTOIRE was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. STYLE AWARD lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the
turn, angled out into the stretch and was not a factor.

ridden out to the wire. AMERICAN ROYALTY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and

Footnotes
TEN THE SMART WAY was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin into the stretch and held sway to the wire.
LILA AT THE BEACH raced unhurried early, advanced five-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with good energy to gain
the place. MAYBE I WILL settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished
with a steady bid. AMAZEN GRAZEN raced off the leaders early from off the rail, stayed on well in the drive and finished willingly. SLEW OF FASHION
lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with a belated bid. MISS ARROWHEAD showed no early
speed, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the eighth pole and did not threaten. SILVER LYRIC chased the leaders while racing
four-wide for a half and weakened. FAST TO FORTUNE raced off the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and weakened. CHIEFTESS AINE
pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. HANDCUFFED lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not
reach contention.

Footnotes
CINDERELLAS PRINCE sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch and held sway to the wire.
SURPRISE FASHION was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the turn, lacked racing room approaching the stretch, angled out with a sixteenth to
run and finished with good courage. CONTINENTAL UNION lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with a late rally. RED STAR
was forwardly placed from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and failed to gain late. SIZZLING EVENING was
never far back while racing along the inside and gave way in the drive. IRISH TERRIER chased the winner while racing three-wide and gave way after going
a half. IVORIAN settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and did not menace. CASH LIMIT showed no
early speed, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out into the lane and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SING IN THE WIND lacked early speed, raced off the rail through the turn, remained inside for the drive, reached the fore inside the furlong marker, opened
a clear lead and held by a diminishing margin. DR WYSONG lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and bumped
with PERFECT STORIES, was quickly straightened away and rallied late to just miss. TRINA stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, stayed on well in
the drive and finished willingly. IXTAPA'S FINEST was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, offered a bid in mid-stretch but
failed to sustain that rally late. PERFECT STORIES was off slow, then raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, was bumped by DR
WYSONG nearing the three-sixteenths pole, steadied, angled in and finished willingly when clear. DEE GEE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide
through the turn, angled out further into the lane, reached a contending position but failed to gain late. SQUARE PEGGY was away alertly to dispute the
early fractions from the inside and gave way through the final sixteenth. GALILETA pressed the pace while racing five-wide for a half and weakened. LOTSA
PEPPER broke sharply to duel for the lead with SQUARE PEGGY while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERNING THE BUMPING BETWEEN DR WYSONG AND PERFECT STORIES AT THE THREE-SIXTEENTH POLE
AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS CONCLUDED DR WYSONG HAD ANGLED OUT AND BUMPED PERFECT STORIES CAUSING HER TO
STEADY, DR WYSONG WAS THEN DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED FIFTH.

PERSUASIVE LIPS sprinted clear soon after the start, responded when challenged by STRADARI nearing the five-sixteenths pole, was headed by that rival
into the stretch, vied and edged away in the final yards. STRADARI chased the winner while racing three-wide, moved up to engage nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, gained a brief lead but could not match strides late. BREAKING THE CODE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the
turn and was up for the show. THRILL'S LEGACY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive.
TRULY FABULOUS was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. SURELY A SMILE raced
off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. MUNNY was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn
and did not menace. TIM'S STREET GIRL showed brief speed and weakened.
