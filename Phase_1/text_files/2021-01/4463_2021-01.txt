Footnotes
SMOKIN HOT MOMMA pressed the pace, raced outside around the turn, drove clear before the wire and finished well. MISS PAT'S GIRL lacked early
speed, made a steady gain, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. GRILLIN unhurried, racing in the middle of the field, made a late bid and
was outfinished for second. SHE'S SEVENTEEN went to the front, drove clear, weakened and lacked a finish. HAVE NO FEAR raced near the back in the
early going, showed late interest, but was no factor. SOUTHERN DUDETTE raced in the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort. NEW ORLEANS
SPICE raced within striking distance and faded. SHALLOW RIVER void of early speed and was never close. TEN COUNT OUT raced within contention,
saved ground around the turn and dropped back. PAPER DOLL trailed throughout and showed little.
