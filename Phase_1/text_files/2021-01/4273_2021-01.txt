Footnotes
WHISKEY'S GONE dueled from the three path took the lead at the half then drew clear late under a drive. JACK'S KISS stalked the pace from the inside
then angled out in the turn and was second best. KISS OF THE WOLF dueled from the two path early while setting the pace during the first half then faded
late. NOMOREQUESTIONS stalked the pace from the four path and lacked the late response needed in the drive. G CISIVE chased the leaders from the
inside and gave and even effort. SAVED AT SEA was allowed to settle and made a mild bid late. SINGINGINTHEWIND raced in the middle of the pack but
was not a factor. PUNKY MONKEY raced in the middle of the pack but was not a factor. ELLERBE dropped back early and was not a factor.
