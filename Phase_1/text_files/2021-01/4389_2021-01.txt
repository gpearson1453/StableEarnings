Footnotes
QUIET PLEASE settled off the leader, vied inside through the final turn then drew away in the stretch while kept to her business. CARMELTINI lagged far
behind, advanced wide and closed well too late. PASATIME reserved off the leaders, bid after half a mile, vied with the winner and tired. WISES LANDING
saved ground close up then weakened on the final turn. PABLO'S DREAM broke slowly, rushed to the front outside then stopped after a half mile. TOO
MUCH DRAMA lacked speed and was never in contention. WHY NOT YOU dropped back early and trailed throughout.

DANZAFIED rushed to the lead inside, ducked out sharply under a left handed whip at the top of top of the stretch, ducked in soon after when struck right
handed and continued well to the finish. HOLD MY CALL bid outside on the turn, loomed a threat at the top stretch but was outfinished in the final furlong.
ALFATEI dropped back wide then flattened out through the stretch. SPACEMAN lagged far behind and caught a rival in the final stride while no factor.
MOOJI MOO JR. pressed the pace outside then began retreating on the turn. Following a stewards inquiry and an objection by the rider of the second
finisher against the winner, DANZAFIED was disqualified and placed second for interference in the stretch.

DOUBLE THE BET advanced between rivals on the turn, collared the leader in the stretch and eagerly drew away. POSITIVE FORCE stalked the
pacesetter outside, bid into the stretch, but proved no match for the winner. FREEDOM PASSAGE saved ground close up, steadied along at the top of the
stretch and continued gamely. ABOVE PAR set the pace just off the inside, was collared nearing the eighth pole and tired. IT'S SO EASY broke sluggishly
and dropped back then lacked a rally. CHARLY'S CHARM was urged just off the leaders three wide between rivals and faded. STEADY LOVE chased
inside, angled out in the stretch and was no factor. WILDCATTIN bobbled at the break, rushed up wide and gave way.

OWIN I AM settled at the back of the pack, moved four wide on the turn, six wide into the stretch then surged late to get up in time. GRAVES ISLAND vied
along the inside, rallied clear briefly in mid stretch, but was nailed nearing the wire. TRUE BOLDNESS saved ground just behind the leaders and continued
well to the finish. LUVINMEISEASY lacked speed, moved very wide on the turn and finished with good late energy. TOMATER GATOR hustled to the front
in the two path, battled into stretch and tired. MACH TRIAL settled wide off the pace, rallied into the stretch then flattened out. TACTICAL PURSUIT (IRE)
outrun early, moved inside on the turn but was no threat. DEVINE DENTAL was urged off the pace three wide for half a mile and weakened.

Footnotes
DEEP SEA was bumped at the start, trailed the field, advanced on the far turn, went four wide past the quarter pole, closed strongly outside and pulled away
under urging. WAIT FOR IT raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up three wide on the backside, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled, gained a short lead
turning for home, dug in gamely but second best. DEAL DRIVEN raced three wide early, then stalked two wide, bid between rivals on the far turn, dug in
and held on for third. FOREWARNED raced off the pace inside, angled out for the drive, closed belatedly and missed for third. WHISTLING BIRDS tracked
along the inside, lacked a bid and weakened. INFURIATED bobbled at the break and was bumped, raced four wide early, cleared off on the first turn to set
the pace, dueled on the far turn and faded. JUMP FOR ALEX raced three or four wide off the pace, four wide on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
VIOLENT TURBULENCE set the pace inside, moved clear on the final turn, drifted out badly in the stretch but held on gamely. STAR SIGN stalked the
pacesetter outside, moved inside the leader but could hot get by the winner. THE ROBERT trailed for five furlongs, rallied very wide through the stretch too
late. O'KRAM urged off the pace three wide, bid five wide in the stretch but flattened out. PAUL THE WAITER chased in mid pack and lacked a solid rally.
QUALITY CHOICE saved ground well off the pace and was never in contention. CELTIC TREASURE prompted the pace outside, was asked for run on the
final turn and proved empty in the stretch. SCREEN SAVER saved ground behind the pacesetters for three quarters and faded. OVER SENSUAL broke
sluggishly, brief a bid after half a mile then faltered. SKIPIN ON ORCHARD lacked speed inside and gave way readily.
