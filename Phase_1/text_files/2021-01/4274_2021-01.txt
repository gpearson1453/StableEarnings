Footnotes
STAR'S DREAM went three wide on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, drafted inside to the two path on the far turn, was asked while coming
through an opening at the quarter-pole, made a bid inside the leader in upper stretch, gained the advantage approaching the furlong marker and drew clear
under steady urging. BOBBIES REASON went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, angled in midway down the backstretch, was roused while
moving from the inside to the four path on the far turn, rallied to the lead into upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner coming to the furlong marker
and proved no match while well clear for the place. BREEZIN BYE YOU jostled with a foe early, went three wide under restraint on the first turn, settled
down the backstretch, was roused while three to four wide on the far turn, gained some late on that bend, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked
the needed response but was clear for the show. PLAYIN N TRAFFIC jostled with foes on both sides early then checked sharply, floated from three to five
wide on the first turn, moved up to track the pace on the outside, was asked in the two to three path on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and
capitulated. YOUNMEHONEYBUNNY went to the front, set the pace on the inside through moderate fractions, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the
advantage under a drive in upper stretch and gave way. SANDY'S WAGER settled on the inside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, saved ground
through the final turn and failed to respond. FLASH ANNIE was carried out into the first turn, went six then five wide on that bend, was urged along near the
back, went three wide on the far turn and was no factor. FLOATIE jostled with a foe early and steadied between horses, went five then six wide on the first
turn, dropped well behind after a half-mile, fell while being eased in upper stretch then was vanned off. THREE-QUARTER FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED

TORNADO CROSSING went around the first turn in the two path, was unhurried towards the back, came under urging in the four path on the far turn, rallied
six wide into the stretch, closed fast to get the lead inside the three-sixteenths, kicked clear into the final furlong and proved best under strong urging.
CREATIVE LEGACY saved ground on the first turn, settled in a good position down the backstretch, raced inside on the far turn, was asked while cutting
the corner into the stretch, made a rail bid at the three-sixteenths, lost touch with the winner inside the furlong marker and was outfinished while able to get
the place. GOINGTOAGOGO moved in early, settled towards the back on the inside, hesitated while negotiating her way into the far turn, shifted to the two
path into the stretch then was carried in behind horses, waited past the three-sixteenths, was roused while moving out outside the furlong marker and lacked
the needed kick but was up for the show. ANNIE'S SHENANIGAN steadied briefly when foes crossed in front early then moved out, went three wide on the
first turn, settled on the outside, was given a couple taps of a down-turned whip inside the five-eighths, was asked four wide on the far turn, spun five wide
into the stretch and weakened. CRAZY GOOD went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused leaving the backstretch then urged along
in the three path on the far turn, drifted in just after turning into the stretch then moved out around the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response.
YOU'RE DOING FINE went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the far turn, took the lead into upper
stretch, lost the advantage to the winner outside the furlong marker and tired. SOFT N LOVELY went to the front, set the pace in the two path, was asked at
the quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and gave way. TWO SKIES was off slow then awkwardly into stride, saved ground at the rear,
came three wide into the stretch, moved further out in the drive and failed to threaten. (Rail at 25 Feet) SEVEN-EIGHTHS FRACTION WAS UNAVAILABLE

JURISDICTION was well rated while rated just off the pace on the inside, came under urging around the five-sixteenths, shifted out into upper stretch and
bumped with a foe, chased into the final furlong then made a bid, battled with multiple opponents to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging.
CURLINGTON hit the gate at the start and was away awkwardly then hustled, raced under stout restraint between horses into the first turn, went three wide
on that bend, was rated off the pace, went around the far turn in the two path while between horses, was bumped out into another foe into upper stretch,
chased into the final furlong then made a bid, battled with multiple rivals to the wire and just missed while able to get the place. BRIAR JUMPER dropped to
the rail early on the first turn, settled towards the rear, went two then three wide for most of the far turn, swerved five wide outside the quarter-pole then was
fanned seven wide into upper stretch, rallied to make a bid inside the furlong marker, battled outside of two foes to the wire and missed but was clear for the
show. JUNIOR BUG was taken under a tight hold early, stalked the pace on the outside in the three path, made a bid on the final turn, gained the lead into
the stretch then shook clear, lost the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened. DAYS OF GLORY broke out and hit the gate, clipped heels into
the first turn, went four wide on that bend, settled on the outside, was urged along while three then four wide on the far turn then fanned six wide into upper
stretch, chased into the final furlong then made a bid, dropped back into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked. DREAMMASTER bumped with foes on both
sides at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled near the back, went three then four wide for most of the far turn, was carried six wide outside the
quarter-pole then eight wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. SANDBAGGER AL broke in and bumped with a rival, was keen under tight
restraint into the first turn, continued keen while saving ground through that bend, was rated off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, shifted out into the
stretch and came up empty. JACK THE RIPPER (FR) tossed his head when taken under a tight hold early, went three wide on the first turn, was rated off
the pace, went four wide on the far turn, was bumped and forced out into upper stretch then capitulated. DOM CAETANO (ARG) broke out and bumped with
a rival, raced inside to the two path while at the rear on the turns and was no factor. SHAR'S TREASURE moved in while going to the front, set the pace in
the two path, was asked while being headed at the quarter-pole and faded. ONE HITTER had DAYS OF GLORY clip his heels into the first turn, went four
wide on that bend, settled on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went five wide on the far turn and failed to respond. (Rail at 25 Feet)

the lead nearing the furlong marker then quickly kicked clear and held under strong urging. IZZY'S BABY BOY broke a bit awkwardly, was urged along

Footnotes
BORN GREAT bumped lightly with a rival after the start, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, turned into the stretch in
the two path then was asked once straightened for the drive, extended the advantage into the final furlong and held under strong urging. SEVEN SCENTS
broke out then bumped lightly with foe after the start, was well placed just off the pace on the inside, saved ground on the turn, was roused while cutting the
corner into the stretch, chased the winner under a drive into the final sixteenth then moved out and finished willingly for the place. ITS A WRAP broke a bit
slow, settled towards the rear, went two to three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and finished with good energy to just miss the place while
narrowly able to get the show. REAL NEWS settled on the outside, was asked three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, chased the winner
under a drive into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked then just missed the trifecta. POWER END bumped with a foe at the start while off a step slow,
settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, moved out inside the furlong marker and gained but missed the
superfecta. GOOD ONE smashed through the front of the gate prior to the start, was brought back around and reloaded, broke in and bumped with a rival,
pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the two path on the turn then was driven three wide into the stretch and tired.

ground on the first turn, raced on the inside of a foe in the second fight, chased three to four wide on the far turn, made a bid into the stretch, drifted out
inside the furlong marker, fought on to the wire but missed while just able to get the place. GUIDED MISSILE broke out at the start, went three then four
wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged five wide on the far turn, advanced to make an outside bid in upper stretch, drifted out inside the
furlong marker, kept on to the wire and just missed the place while able to get the show. JOB SECURITY broke out at the start, rounded the first turn in the
two path, settled at the rear, was urged three then four wide on the far turn, gained under a drive into upper stretch, moved out outside the furlong marker,
shifted further out near the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly. GLORY ROAD went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, dropped
back under urging while four then three wide on the far turn and lacked the needed response. POTOMAC raced inside to the two path on the first turn,
settled towards the rear, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, saved ground on the far turn, came out into the stretch and failed to respond. KADESH
went four to five wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was hard ridden in the two path on the far turn and faltered.

LATE NITE MISCHIEF went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the far turn, took the lead outside
the quarter-pole, shook off the runner-up into the final furlong and edged clear under steady urging. CLINT MAROON (GB) bumped with a rival at the start,
went to the front, set the pace on the inside while in hand, was headed outside the quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and was
outfinished but was clear for the place. VINYL was well placed just off the pace on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, moved out under the whip
in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show then was vanned off after the race. JO'S BOLD CAT went three wide on the first turn,
settled towards the rear, rounded the far turn in the three path, shifted five wide then waited behind a foe into upper stretch, altered in around the
three-sixteenths then was roused, moved out into the final furlong, came between horses outside the sixteenth-pole and improved position. YA GOTTA
WANNA went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch then moved further out,
raced between horses into the final sixteenth and missed the superfecta. ARMCHAIR JOCKEY broke out and bumped with a rival at the start then stumbled,
rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved at the rear on the outside, started the far turn in the two path, shifted four wide under urging at the
five-sixteenths, came six wide into the stretch then moved further out and gained but failed to seriously threaten. TAKE THAT FOR DATA saved ground on
the first turn, settled off the pace, raced inside for most of the far turn then moved to the two path, came three wide into the stretch behind a rival, was
roused outside the three-sixteenths, moved out into the final furlong and lacked the needed response. FOLDOVER saved ground on the first turn, settled
near the middle of the field, was asked in the two path on the far turn, angled out under a drive in upper stretch, drifted out inside the furlong marker and
also lacked the needed response. STOCK TRADE was taken under a tight hold early, saved ground on the turns, came out into upper stretch and was no
factor. MAJOR KEY went four wide on the first turn, settled outside towards the front, was urged along four wide on the far turn and came up empty. (Rail at
25 Feet)

Footnotes
DEBS PRAYER went to the front, set the pace on the inside, inched clear on the far turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, came under a
drive into upper stretch and drew off under strong urging. SLEWALYZE went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the back, was urged along
while inside early on the far turn then moved to the two path, turned into upper stretch under a drive and earned the place while no match for the winner.
LOOKING HOT bumped soundly with a rival at the start, was well placed on the inside, chased on the far turn, moved to the two path late on that bend,
pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and was no match then lost the place but was clear for the show. GONE MIDNIGHT brushed the
inside of the gate at the start and was off a bit slow, went three wide on the turns, dropped to the two path under urging outside the three-sixteenths and
failed to rally. MY REBEL GIRL bumped soundly with a foe just after the start, raced inside early on the first turn then shifted three wide, lagged at the rear,
went four wide early on the far turn then shifted six wide outside the quarter-pole, came five wide into the stretch, moved out approaching the sixteenth-pole
and failed to threaten. MAYBE BABY bumped soundly with an opponent just after the start, went four wide on the first turn, was rated just off the pace,
started the far turn in the two path under urging, shifted three then four wide later on that bend, was driven five wide into the stretch and came up empty.
SHOP AROUND went two to three wide on the first turn, disputed the pace on the outside, dropped back under urging in the three path on the far turn and
retreated. SEEKING THE STARS bumped soundly with a rival at the start, went four to five wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside under a
snug hold, came up empty while four to five wide on the far turn and tired.
