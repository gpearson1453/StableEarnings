BLUE LIZZY followed the early pace, went six wide into the turn, was closing late, took control late stretch and edged clear. RIVER JUMPER set a clear
early pace, went five wide into the turn, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best. SARAH'S STAR raced in mid pack, advanced between rivals,
angled to the inside and was along for third. BEAUTIFUL BABE was unhurried early, went four wide, angled out late and finished with a mild late rally.
THREE CHIPS was void of speed, raced along the inside and passed tired rivals. AKUBA tracked the early pace, raced seven wide and was empty.
SWEET REGARDS stalked the early pace, went three wide and tired. LOST FREEDOM was taken back early, raced off the rail and offered no rally.

Footnotes
LUCKY STEPPER pressed the early pace, went four wide into the second turn, made a bid on LADY ROBIN, dueled briefly with that rival, shook clear,
angled in and held for the win. REAL GOOD DEAL was unhurried early, advanced six wide into the turn, was gaining late and finished second best. GOOD
FOR NOW tracked the early pace, went five wide into the second turn and was empty. LADY ROBIN set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the
home turn, met the bid of the winner, dueled briefly and weakened. LADY JADE stalked the early pace from between rivals and faded. LADY SUZZETT was
outrun early, went four wide and was no threat. GREATER GLORY raced in mid pack early, went three wide into the second turn and flattened out.
AMBERS STORM was allowed to settle early, circled seven wide through the turn, angled in and never fired. VONHRA stumbled at the start, had no speed
and was no factor.
