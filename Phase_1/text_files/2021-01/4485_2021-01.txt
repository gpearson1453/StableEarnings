Footnotes
EXXTOP broke outwardly, bumped a foe into another causing multiple rivals to be bothered at the start, set the pace along the inside, met NONA RAC's bid
approaching the five sixteenth pole, came under urging turning for home to repel that foe in upper stretch, then held from SADIO late. SADIO was jostled
and pinched back between horses at the start, tracked from midpack down the backstretch, came under urging and chased the leaders from the three path
around the turn, shifted to the five path to be outside of the dueling leaders at the three sixteenths pole, then grinded away at the leader's advantage while
hanging on his left lead and subtly drifting out, but did not have enough to catch the leader. NONA RAC lied forwardly placed along the inside, shifted
outside of the leader into the turn, bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, vied turning for home, but drifted out a bit while getting repelled by his inner
counterpart in upper stretch, and tired. GEOMETRICO lied far off of the pace in the two path around the turn, and improved without threatening. ROYAL
MEETING was bumped by an inner rival into an outer rival at the start, prompted the pace two wide, but chased three wide around the turn and faded. CITY
GLORY was never involved. WATER CAY failed to factor. NEVERENOUGHCOCO was outrun. UNIMPEACHED bumped with an inner foe at the start, lied
forwardly placed three wide early on, but weakened passing the half mile pole, faded in the five path around the turn, and was eased thereafter.

SAGE CANYON raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch, continued on the left lead through the lane and was up and clear late.
STARSHIP TAXI dueled along the rail, kicked clear near the quarter pole, held clear to deep stretch but had no resistance to the winner in the later yards.
TOOK A CAB settled off the pace while racing three wide and was one-paced in the lane to gain the show. DEO FORTE stalked the duel three wide in the
clear and came up empty in the lane. THE SPIDER saved ground off the pace, swung widest turning for home and lacked a rally. BALABAN was outrun
inside. COOL DIXIE MAN dueled two wide and stopped nearing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
MISTA DONZELLA set the pace along the inside, met a pair of bids around the far turn, dug in to resist those foes turning for home, shook clear passing the
furlong marker, and held sway. HE AIN'T NO SAINT stalked three to two wide around the first turn, then three wide around the far turn, got outmoved by
DOUBLE DAVID at the five sixteenths grounds, shifted four wide and outside of that rival in upper stretch, and produced a grinding rally inside of QUINTO
SOL through the lane to reach place on the wire. ESPECIALLEA veered in at the start but was not costed early position, pulled under a hard hold to an
inside stalking position, held that spot turning for home while shifting to the two path, but lacked clear racing room while chasing behind the leader through
the lane, finally found room late while forging place, but was nailed on the wire for that position. QUINTO SOL bumped with an inner foe at the start, lied off
of the pace two wide, swung to the six path turning for home, and stayed on outside of rivals through the lane while shifting ground a bit inwards. LIAMS
STAR prompted the pace two wide, bid for the lead at the quarter pole as DOUBLE DAVID rallied alongside, but was turned away by the leader
approaching the furlong marker, and tired. DOUBLE DAVID was bumped between horses at the start, trailed into the far turn, rallied four wide around that
bend to bid for the lead outside of a pair of rivals at the quarter pole, but flattened out in midstretch, and faded between horses before checking mildly inside
the final sixteenth. WESTERLY WIND broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, lied off of the pace along the inside, saved ground, but to no avail.

DUGOUT pressed the pace two wide, took over between rivals near the quarter pole, drifted out entering the lane, vied to midstretch, drew clear leaving the
eighth pole, continued to drift out under right-handed urging and held safe. DISCRETIONARY MARQ stalked the pace three wide, was floated about five
wide into the lane, stayed on willingly outside of the winner but could not reel that foe in. TENACITY ZIP raced two and three wide in midpack and rallied for
the show. GRAN MALBEC saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied belatedly between foes. COLONEL TOM raced off the pace
two wide, swung five wide near the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY failed to menace while racing two wide. EARTH
set the pace along the rail, resisted the winner to midstretch then tired. MAR VISTA MIGUEL chased the pace inside, tipped two wide near the quarter pole
and came up empty in the final furlong.

LA CARA BONITA stalked the pace three wide, seized command near the sixteenth pole and drove clear late. ZIP IT JESS prompted the pace from the rail,
took the lead turning for home, led to the sixteenth pole and was second best late. CENTSATIONAL was off a bit slow, saved ground well back early, angled
four wide near the five-sixteenths marker, rallied outside and just missed second. NOBLE MARIA was in tight early, saved ground off the pace, swung
widest in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. HURRICANE BREEZE went evenly while racing two wide. YELLEN set the pace two wide to upper stretch and
tired. FREEZER BURN played no factor while racing three wide. DREAM CHASING was outrun while racing four wide.

Footnotes
ZONIC lied far off of the pace in the three path around the turn, commenced a rally while shifting five wide turning for home, bid outside of rivals
approaching the final sixteenth, and drove clear. AREYOUTALKINGTOME chased from midpack four wide, inched closer turning for home to bid for the lead
in upper stretch, forged an advantage inside the final furlong while hanging on his left lead, but was outkicked by an outer rallying foe late. JANUARY WON
lied forwardly placed three wide, bid for the lead outside of, and simultaneously with, STARSHIP APOLLO at the five sixteenths grounds, forged an
advantage from that foe in upper stretch, switched to his right lead at the furlong pole, but was outkicked by an outer foe passing that marker. STARSHIP
APOLLO stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the pace setter into the turn, bid for the lead inside of JANUARY WON at the five sixteenths pole, but
was outkicked by that foe in upper stretch, and faded. AEQUOR set the pace along the inside, but was headed at the five sixteenths pole, and gave way.
QUASAR MOON bobbled a bit and was crowded in a bit of tight quarters between horses at the start, lied far off of the pace three wide, took the turn in the
five path, and never got involved. ROSAS WAY saved ground while off of the pace, but to no avail. MONMOUTH DR prompted the pace two wide, but
weakened between horses into the turn, and was done early.

FOUZIA set the pace along the rail, kicked clear around the turn and held clear under a drive. CAN'T BUY LOVE saved ground off the pace, angled out in
upper stretch and finished willingly to gain the place in deep stretch. LA LIBERTEE stalked the winner two wide, was one-paced through the lane and lost
second late. MAGICAL SOUL saved ground off the pace, angled four wide in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and made a mild gain. GAMBLING
CAT failed to menace while racing two wide. DANESSA BABY steadied entering the turn, saved ground well back, angled out turning for home and lacked a
bid.

Footnotes
WEDONTBELIEVEHER prompted three wide, then only outside of SAMMY'S TOWN while kept in the three path around the turn, failed to keep pace with
that foe in upper stretch, but sustained his chase under a long drive as that rival tired, and drove past him approaching the wire. SAMMY'S TOWN vied two
wide, forged an advantage into the turn, showed the way inside of WEDONTBELIEVEHER while staying in the two path around the turn, kicked clear of that
rival in upper stretch, but tired in the final furlong, drifted outwards, and was bested late. KATNISS KAN lied off of the pace in the four path, gained to
striking range around the turn, but leveled off and chased the leaders home. TREVESS chased along the inside around the turn, but was held up behind the
tiring MY LITTLE ROSE at the five sixteenths pole, slipped inside of that foe turning for home, then stayed on for a minor share. ABARRIO FOREVER lied
off of the pace along the inside while under steady urging, swung to the six path turning for home, but failed to mount a challenge. MY LITTLE ROSE set the
pace along the inside, but was headed by a pair of foes into the turn, and faded around it. LAILONI tracked from midpack two wide, but came under a drive
at the three furlong pole, lacked a response, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, and faded. TALKTHETALK hopped at the start, took the turn in the five
path while far off of the pace, and never got involved. DUBAIAN was outrun.
