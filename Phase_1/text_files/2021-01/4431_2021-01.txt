Footnotes
TOFFEN took command after the start, rated along on a clear lead inside to the stretch, drifted out late under left-hand pressure and was saved by the wire.
APURATE saved ground for six furlongs, moved off the rail into the stretch, bid outside the winner and needed one more stride. FURIA VIKINGA (CHI)
moved in from the three path leaving the first turn, cut the corner into the stretch, came out with a late bid and finished gamely between the top two.
VIVIDLY (GB) missed the break by two lengths and was taken inside, shifted off the rail around the far turn, and rallied belatedly on the far outside.
STICKINGTOGETHER raced two wide on the turns, and lacked the needed closing response. ORENCIA stayed in range two then three wide to the stretch,
and had no rally. FOLLOW THE FLAG was a step slow to begin, and failed to factor two wide. MORAL REASONING lagged well back early, came four wide
off the far turn and made no impact. TWO CENT TOOTSIE was outrun inside. WHAT A BEAUT prompted the pace two wide for six furlongs, and faded.
HOLYANNA raced three wide and was finished by midway on the far turn.

Footnotes
MICROSECOND crossed over clearing to the early lead, rated along inside to the stretch, and responded well to keep BEAU LUMINARIE at bay. BEAU
LUMINARIE prompted the pace outside MICROSECOND from the outset, challenged coming off the far turn, could not get by and settled for second best.
MYSTIC LANCELOT broke alertly despite hitting the left side of the gate, saved ground to the stretch, moved off the rail and finished one-paced. FALKIRK
saved ground early, moved out tracking the leaders up the backstretch, and lacked a solid closing response. JUULSTONE moved off the inside midway on
the far turn, and made no gains. BRAY lagged far back for six furlongs, and improved without threatening. JUNKANOO raced in the second flight and never
made an impact. READY SOUL failed to menace. SCANNO raced three wide in range early, and tired after six furlongs. LOMU came under a ride into the
far turn, and was empty. HOMELAND was never prominent. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, FRACTIONAL TIMES UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
PERFORMER stalked the pace two wide, angled four wide turning for home, reached near even terms approaching the eighth pole, dueled outside of EYE
OF A JEDI throughout the final furlong and prevailed. EYE OF A JEDI saved ground off the pace, made progress inside around the turn, split rivals two wide
nearing the lane, bid between foes nearing the eighth pole, battled on inside of the winner through the lane and was narrowly outfinished. AVANT GARDE
settled off the pace, raced two wide around the turn and rallied inside to gain the show. SHIVAREE set a pressured pace along the rail, hung in well to the
eighth pole then weakened. PHAT MAN raced three wide and never threatened. DREAM MAKER pressed the pace two wide to upper stretch and tired.
INDIMAAJ was in range three and four wide and came up empty in the lane. HAIKAL chased the pace four wide, came four wide into the lane and lacked a
response. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
OLYMPIC RUNNER was crowded by STIRLING DRIVE and bumped with inner rivals at the start, raced well back in the two-path to the far turn, swung wide
into the stretch and kicked in strongly to get up outside WINTERS BACK near the wire. WINTERS BACK raced in striking range three wide to the stretch,
reached the front past the sixteenth-pole outside SILENCED, but could not hold off the winner. EMARAATY (GB) was held up in traffic going by the
quarter-pole and into upper stretch inside, maneuvered through between rivals and finished gamely. OPRY settled in the middle of the field for six furlongs,
bid along the fence through the furlong grounds but did not have enough. MALIBU MAMBO saved ground early, took the far turn four wide, and needed
more late. ANGELUS WARRIOR raced two wide through the turns, and gained mildly without threatening. SILENCED set the pace inside to mid stretch,
and gave way. THUNDER RIDE raced forwardly two wide to the stretch, and weakened. STIRLING DRIVE came in after the start causing crowding, and
tired into the stretch. ATTACHMENT RATE lagged far back to the stretch, swung wide and made no impact. KINGMEISTER was bumped and shut off
between BORRACHO and OLYMPIC RUNNER at the break, then stumbled behind those two right after that, and never got close. BORRACHO bumped
with KINGMEISTER at the start, pressed the pace outside to the stretch, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile.

Footnotes
PREVALENCE broke in and brushed QUANTUM LEAP at the start, had speed inside, spurted clear nearing the lane and widened under a hand ride.
STAGE RAIDER disputed the pace three wide down the backstretch, pressed the winner two wide around the turn, could not match strides with that foe
nearing the lane but stayed on to preserve the place. GHAZAALY had some early speed inside, dropped back under urging around the turn, tipped out
nearing the lane, angled back in in upper stretch and rallied for the show. FULL COURT PRESS raced three wide in midpack and never threatened. HOLY
REDEEMER broke slowly, rushed up between foes, chased the pace three wide around the turn and came up empty in the lane. QUANTUM LEAP was
brushed at the start, raced two and three wide and failed to menace. TRAVELLER played no factor while racing five wide. EXALTED CHARM broke a bit
awkwardly, raced three wide and made little impact. PREGAME was outrun while racing two wide. MARCHING had only brief speed four wide. RABDAN
played no factor while racing two wide. LONGTAIL broke slowly, raced four wide and was outrun.

Footnotes
ZOFELLE (IRE) was unhurried early inside, moved out two then three wide taking closer order after six furlongs, overpowered SWEET BYE AND BYE from
outside near the eighth-pole and kicked away. SWEET BYE AND BYE tracked three wide outside the leaders for six furlongs, reached a short lead outside
VIGILANTES WAY in upper stretch, could not withstand the winner but held well for the place. BELLE LAURA followed behind the front flight inside to the
far turn, came two wide into the stretch, and could not reach the top two with an even finish. TUNED (GB) broke slowly and was outrun early, swung four
wide approaching the lane, and gained mildly for a share. VIGILANTES WAY pressed the pace outside OUR BAY B RUTH, wrested command coming to
the quarter-pole, moved inside turning for home and gave way near the furlong marker. EVIL LYN raced in range between horses to the far turn, and lacked
a rally. NIKO'S DREAM was no factor three to four wide throughout. GREAT SISTER DIANE broke slowly, saved ground and was never prominent. OUR
BAY B RUTH set the pace inside, and folded up once displaced up front approaching the stretch. LOVELY LA LA tired after a half-mile three wide.

Footnotes
ALWAYS SHOPPING tracked the pace from the rail, angled three wide near the three-eighths pole, seized command in upper stretch, quickly cleared and
widened under a drive. DELTA'S KINGDOM settled off the pace while racing two wide, steadied the first time through the stretch, remained two wide in
midpack to upper stretch, angled out and rallied for the place. IRONY OF REALITY raced well back inside, circled four and five wide around the far turn to
reach contention, continued on the left lead in the lane and evened out. SISTER HANAN saved ground off the pace around all three turns and improved
position in the lane. HEAVENLY CURLIN failed to menace while racing two and three wide. COURT RETURN pressed the pace two wide, fought on to
midstretch and tired. CAMBELIZA played no factor while racing two wide. LOVELY LUCKY saved ground in midpack, angled three wide entering the far turn
and had no response. ENGLISH AFFAIR checked while rank early, raced off the pace three wide around the first two turns, made a quick three wide bid
nearing the far turn, took the lead late on the bend but soon retreated. CAP DE CREUS was outrun while racing three wide. TRAIPSING rated off the pace
outside, lost action briefly the first time through the stretch, recovered to chase three wide but was through after a mile. AUNT HATTIE (IRE) set the pace
along the rail and stopped midway around the far turn.

PACIFIC GALE bumped with PIEDI BIANCHI at the start, was covered up between horses and behind the leaders for five furlongs, came clear three wide at
the top of the stretch, rallied to the front outside THISSMYTIME past the eighth-pole and drew clear under a strong hand drive. THISSMYTIME dueled for
command outside CINNABUNNY, got the best of that dispute through the furlong grounds, could not resist the winner but held well for second. PIEDI
BIANCHI bumped with PACIFIC GALE at the start, was outsprinted early inside, came two wide off the far turn and rallied mildly. CINNABUNNY dueled
inside THISSMYTIME from the start, and weakened through the late stages. DREAM MARIE broke slowly, swung four wide approaching the stretch, and
could not reach contention. BRONX BEAUTY raced close up inside to the stretch, and faded on the rail. SALLY'S CURLIN broke slowly, saved ground and
was always in arrears. SOUND MACHINE tracked outside early, had aim outside the leaders three then four wide leaving the turn, but came up empty.

TIDE OF THE SEA set a rated pace a bit off the rail, responded when TEMPLE bid outside in upper stretch, clung to a narrow lead passing the eighth pole
then was edging back away late. TEMPLE settled off the early pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, reached near even terms
approaching the eighth pole but was turned back by the winner while holding second. DOSWELL was firmly rated while up close inside, swung out nearing
the eighth pole and made a slight gain in the final sixteenth. SADLER'S JOY lagged far back two wide, advanced four and five wide around the far turn and
rallied belatedly down the center of the course. CHANNEL CAT raced two wide in midpack, made progress nearing the lane and evened out in the final
furlong. SIR ANTHONY failed to menace while racing three wide. SUCCEEDANDSURPASS (IRE) stalked the winner two wide and came up empty in the
lane. CLEAR VISION played no factor while racing three wide. MIRINAQUE (ARG) bumped with TINTORETTO at the start then saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
COLONEL LIAM settled in the middle of the field early, moved off the inside to the three-path with a quarter-mile remaining, switched out wider into the
stretch, kicked in strongly and was up outside LARGENT in time. LARGENT saved ground following behind the leading trio up the backstretch, looked to try
and get out to the two-path leaving the far turn but opted to stay inside, got through on the fence taking over from STORM THE COURT in upper stretch,
finished gamely but was edged out late. CROSS BORDER raced well back three wide to the stretch, and finished with good energy to get up for the show.
SOCIAL PARANOIA pressed the pace three to four wide, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened through the late stages. PIXELATE stayed in range
near the two-path for nearly a mile, came four wide off the far turn, and lacked a solid final response. NEXT SHARES was slow to get going, circled five
wide into the stretch and improved position without threatening. STORM THE COURT was nursed along setting the pace inside, came into the lane two
wide and was overrun from both flanks. AQUAPHOBIA raced two wide at or near the back, and never fired. BREAKING THE RULES saved ground to no
avail. NORTH DAKOTA was off a beat slow and trailed to the far turn, circled five wide into the lane and could not gain. SAY THE WORD raced three to four
wide, and tired in the stretch. ANOTHERTWISTAFATE pressed the pace two wide, reached a short lead between STORM THE COURT and SOCIAL
PARANOIA coming to the top of the stretch, could not sustain the bid and steadied while tiring through the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
KNICKS GO sped to the front, set the pace in the two path, cleared off down the backstretch, remained in the two-path rounding the far turn, drew off under
a drive through most of the lane and held well clear while geared down in the final yards. JESUS' TEAM settled off the pace while racing three wide, edged
closer under urging four wide around the far turn, stayed on willingly while unable to threaten the winner and outfinished INDEPENDENCE HALL for the
place. INDEPENDENCE HALL bobbled at the break, stalked the winner from the rail, angled out near the quarter pole, could not gain on the winner, vied
inside of JESUS' TEAM for second and was outfinished. SLEEPY EYES TODD rated off the early pace, raced well back two wide around both turns and
passed tiring rivals in the lane. CODE OF HONOR was a bit washy pre-race, settled off the pace while racing two wide between foes, made some progress
in upper stretch and flattened out through the final furlong. COASTAL DEFENSE saved ground and failed to menace. KISS TODAY GOODBYE was outrun
while racing three wide around the first turn and four wide around the far turn. LAST JUDGMENT prompted the winner in the three path and tired after six
furlongs. MATH WIZARD broke awkwardly, raced two wide and made little impact. TAX tracked the pace three wide to upper stretch, continued on the left
lead in the lane and retreated. MR FREEZE played no factor while racing four wide around the first turn and three wide around the far turn. HARPERS
FIRST RIDE raced off the pace two wide, stopped around the far turn and was easing through the lane.
