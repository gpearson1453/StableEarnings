BATTLE OF THE NILE forced the pace outside, took over after half a mile then drew away under a brisk hand ride. HORSE BE WITH YOU seta pressured
pace inside for five furlongs and continued well while no match for the winner. GREY GIANT broke sluggishly, lacked speed then rallied mildly for the show.
MAC AND BREEZE was urged close up between foes early then weakened. SMART TEE dropped back outside and was never in contention. GO SKIPPY
GO lagged far behind throughout. MISSED THE BUS saved ground and stopped abruptly.

MIAMI TIGER settled outside off the pace advanced on the final turn, rallied clear and lasted in a steady drive. SHALAKO lacked speed, angled wide in the
stretch, drifted in and closed the gap too late. DODDSPRIVATELABEL trailed for half a mile, moved closer to the rail on the final turn then flattened out.
WORTH HIS SALT set a pressured pace inside, vied through the final turn and came up empty. AMERICAN ROMA fanned wide through the opening half
mile and faded. MASS APPEAL prompted the leader outside for three furlongs and gave way. SPIDER JORGENSEN saved ground close up briefly then
gave way readily.

Footnotes
JAMMINWITHBRANDON tracked close up on the inside, moved up midway on the far turn, came two wide into the lane, rallied inside rivals and finished
willingly late to draw clear. SOUTHERN BRIDGE stalked between rivals, chased on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied between rival in the
stretch drive and dug in gamely for second. JAYJAYDEE pressed the pace, bid two wide entering the far turn, dueled with DOUBLE CHUBBLE, led entering
the stretch, drew clear, weakened late and held on to win the show photo. SAMBAM raced five wide early, settled two wide off the pace, went four wide on
the far turn, rallied mildly outside and just missed for third. ROAN MOUNTAIN broke in the air and was off slowly, raced off the pace inside and failed to
threaten. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE raced four wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace and had no rally. DOUBLE CHUBBLE set the pace on the inside,
dueled on the far turn and faded. KID MACHO stalked three wide, then chased three wide and gave way.

Footnotes
ZITMAN settled behind the pacesetters, bid outside, wore down the leader nearing the eighth pole and lasted. FINGLAS reserved at the back of the pack,
advanced inside, swung wide into the stretch and rallied too late. SPRING EMPEROR chased close up inside, angled out in the stretch with a mild rally. MR
CLASSICAL prompted the pace three wide, led briefly and continued gamely to the finish. KRISTI'S COPILOT chased between rivals for three quarters and
faded in the stretch. FIVE MORE MINUTES hustled to a clear advantage inside, was collared on the final turn and gave way. SPEED SYNDROME was
taken under a firm rating hold and never in contention. A claim of foul by the rider of SPRING EMPEROR against the winner for interference in deep stretch
was quickly dismissed by the stewards.

Footnotes
SHANGHAISWEETHEART controlled the pace inside, widened in the stretch and remained safe while kept to her task. BANGLE GAL split rivals advancing
after a quarter mile and made a gradual late gain. CREEDIBILITY lagged far behind inside then offered some late energy. ZENSATIONAL DIXIE urged
inside, moved very wide on the turn and into the stretch. TIZ A DATE chased outside then came again passing tiring rivals. GRACE AND PEACE prompted
the leader wide down the backstretch and stopped. UP JUST IN TIME chased within striking range early and gave way on the turn. FINDING PERFECTION
saved ground off the early pace and weakened steadily.

MANOLETE advanced inside on the turn, took over into the stretch and stayed safe driving. MONTELEONE broke slowest, rallied outside and closed
gamey making a gradual gain. FLASHY KYEM was put to urging moving on the turn but flattened out in the stretch. AMERICAN TALENT chased wide to
the stretch and lacked a rally. KING'S HOUSE set a clear pace off the inside, was collared into the stretch and weakened. FACTOR THIS IN was outrun
early between rivals and never a factor. BOLITA BOYZ dropped back very wide then passed tiring rivals. FRAN'S WORRIER urged close up inside then
began faltering on the turn. NICK THE CARDSHARK lacked speed, was put to whip on the turn and drifted out badly through the stretch.
