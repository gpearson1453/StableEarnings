Footnotes
THE REDS saved ground through the first turn before settling two to three wide in pursuit from the tail of the compact field, remained patiently handled just
off the inside through the far turn advancing into contention near the quarter pole, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command a furlong from home, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. INSPIRATION POINT stumbled at the start and broke on top despite it, showed the
way in hand just off the inside through sensible splits under the watchful eye of RUN SMITTY RUN to the outside but facing little pressure, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths as that rival intensified the pressure, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive under threat to the outside, got
collared a furlong out, ran on to secure the place honors clear of the rest. NEPOTISM two then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. AL'S PRINCE coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside until
tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along three furlongs out, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. RUN SMITTY RUN
forwardly placed three wide through the first turn, was under a firm hold four paths off the inside down the backstretch attending the leader to the outside,
tucked three wide through the far turn and steadily increased the pressure on that rival getting placed to urging five-sixteenths from home, swung four wide
into upper stretch and faltered. Please note that due to a winter weather safety initiative all riders carried an additional two pounds.

Footnotes
FAIR LASSIE taken hold of in the shadow of the starting gate, got going shortly afterwards when put to some coaxing, raced at a considerable distance from
off the rail throughout, hitched up to the front runners after departing the backstretch from the four path, pressed the issue as the widest member of a
quartet, came up to the three-sixteenths pole and got called upon for more, responded, ground her way to the ones to catch resolutely and, got the job done
right at the finish line. FAIR REGIS sparred for command two wide in between rivals practically all the way to the quarter pole, well held during the early
going of it, was called upon spinning onto the top of the lane, forged to a slim lead during the ensuing furlong, dueled with the winner during the final
sixteenth, and although showing some willingness all the way to the end, wound up denied. SISTER PATRICIA remained forwardly placed after the field had
been sent on its way, got guided into the three path, vied as the outermost of three for a good portion of the journey on the backstretch, and then from
between opponents during the run around the bend, was turned loose for the stretch run, fell back in the lane, but managed to stay on well enough to
salvage the show. DUBLINORNOTHIN cut over to the rail after establishing the top, was forced to fend off several rivals at at time seemingly from the
get-go, initially a twosome and then once on the turn, a threesome, had the pilot lose the whip relinquishing in upper stretch, battled on before weakening in
the final sixteenth. MICROMILLION reserved two wide, was worked into path six from upper to midstretch, made no impact. CATHY NAZ rode the rail,
under encouragement while on the turn, was maneuvered towards path five during the first half of the stretch drive, gave way. KINKY SOX mostly three
wide on the turn, got sent out into path seven in the lane, never made its presence felt. All riders carried an additional two pounds in compliance with a
weather-related safety initiative.

Footnotes
DEMOCRATIC VALUES assumed a prominent position, settled into the three path, pressed the issue from between rivals for the majority of the trip leading
up to the five-sixteenths pole, rider atop with confidence, bid when ready a furlong down the road, took charge, drew out to a comfortable advantage before
getting taken in hand once more for the last forty yards. MY FIRST GRAMMY gathered after coming in with her initial step losing its footing, grabbed a
narrow advantage, remained stationed towards the two path showing the way, facing pressure from two others to her outside on the backstretch, and then
from three others to her outside on the bend, came under a drive approaching the quarter pole, proved no match when the winner was let out at the
three-sixteenths pole, barely saved second. ESOR stumbled at the start, recovered and managed to take up position in midpack, hitched up to the front
runners to become a part of the pace scene after departing the backstretch from path five, kept pace, got set down prior to the quarter pole, stepped into the
lane, narrowed up to MY FIRST GRAMMY, lost the place photo. KITH pursued the pace from path two, under a ride while between rivals on the turn, angled
five wide from upper to midstretch, mustered up a mild response sufficient enough to lay claim to the final significant slice of the purse. A GRAY FOR
CAROLYN three wide onto the turn, got sent out six wide exiting it, made no impact. BOURBON RISING forwardly placed four wide, disputed the pace as
one of the middle members of a group of four on the turn before giving out. OUCH OUCH OUCH underwent a ground-saving journey, was under some
encouragement making her way on the turn, went into the stretch and faltered. All riders carried an additional two pounds in compliance with a
weather-related safety initiative.

Footnotes
MAKE MISCHIEF five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch in pursuit from mid pack, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from home, edged clear under a drive to prevail. PLEASURE
LUCK five paths off the inside just off a duel, tucked four wide through the turn advancing steadily to vie for command through the latter portion of the bend
while patiently handled, took over the front let out swinging six wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, ran on to be along
clear of the rest and second best. SHANES PRETTY LADY chased two to three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole, dug in under a drive flattening out in the late stages while
clear for the show honors. OUT FIRST four wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing three furlongs
from home, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. IOVA four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, went three wide through
the turn placed to coaxing midway, angled seven wide for home and weakened. CHASING CARA showed the way shortly after the start before being
confronted by her stablemate, dueled with that foe from the five-eighths to the five-sixteenths when taking narrow and sole command put to coaxing, swung
four to five wide for home, yielded the front straightened away and tired. MENDHAM chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went
seven to eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact. CARAMOCHA coaxed from the start, came under hustling to poke a nose in front five furlongs
from home and dueled three then two wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, got shaken off through the latter portion of the turn, spun
three wide into upper stretch and faltered. Please note that due to a winter weather safety initiative all riders carried an additional two pounds.

JUST READ IT took up residence in midpack, sat perched three wide keeping an eye on the front runners, flashed some interest as the half was being
completed, tipped one path farther off the rail for the stretch run, surged to the front, continued to pad the winning margin despite drifting out a bit in the late
stages. DESPEIGHT ALL ODDS pursued the pace two to three wide, swung wider and wider once in the stretch until approximately six wide, had a good
finish down the center of the strip to be along for the place. HEELS TOGETHER put to some urging seemingly from the get-go, chased the pace towards the
two path on the turn, swung out four wide into upper stretch, got out-muscled by STRONG POINT for its path in the general area of the three-sixteenths
marker, obligingly tipping one wider attempting to avoid additional contact, inched up, fell short of snagging away second. CAUSE TO DREAM rode the rail,
got set down to a hard drive as the second fraction was being finalized, cut the corner into the lane, tired in the final furlong. STRONG POINT tracked the
pace from just off the inside, moved to the outside for the stretch run, bumped its way into path four right around the three-sixteenths pole, made no
headway. CHARGINA went on to spar for the top two wide after stumbling at the start, went about the task on the turn being ridden along, arrived at the
head of the stretch and gave way. MY DELICIOUS disputed the pace from along the inside route until upper stretch, backed away readily after releasing the
advantage. All riders carried an additional two pounds in compliance with a weather-related safety inititaive.

Footnotes
ELEGANT ZIP four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying through
the final furlong to get up in the last strides and score. MISS JIMMY chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside for home, dug in under a drive latching on the leader inside the eighth pole, knocked heads to the finish getting collared in tandem by the top one in
the last jumps while prevailing for the place honors. RUVIES IN TIME coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, got set down taking
the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat holding stubborn until collared in the final jumps, then got bested for the place honors at the end while

paced through to the finish. BABY BOSS hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, got coaxed along at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. PENDOLINO chased five wide under a ride from the three-eighths,
swung six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. AWESOME ALANA two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the turn, went

Footnotes
HELLO HOT ROD responded to some encouragement springing from the gate to establish the top, took up residence in the two path, led the way, pulling a
bit on the bit with the second place finisher applying some pressure to his outside, saw PICO D'ORO add itself to the pace picture by the top of the lane,
successfully defended the advantage during the run around the bend, got let out for the drive home, vied with vigour matched up with both RETURN THE
RING and PICO D'ORO, didn't quit and gamely got the job done. RETURN THE RING argued for the top with the winner while three wide, went about the
task from between rivals on the turn, was set down for the drive, remained engaged in a spirited tussle with HELLO HOT ROD, with the show horse still
lurking a danger close behind, menacingly chipped away at the deficit, but couldn't go by an opponent having mustered up an equal amount of
determination. PICO D'ORO settled into the four path, was the widest of three contending for the top beginning from the top of the bend, kept at the task at
hand all the way down the lane too en route for the show award. SCOTCH ROCK'S underwent a two wide pursuit on the turn, was worked into path four
from upper to midstretch, narrowed in. MAGNIFICENT CHROME took the inside route keeping an eye on the front runners, without benefit of much cover,
got roused into the lane, backed away. All riders carried an additional two pounds in compliance with a weather-related safety initiative.

Footnotes
SCOTTY dueled five then four wide with WAR OF THRONES to his inside down the backstretch and into the turn, took over sole command at the
seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled in to spin just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail.
LOULOVESTHERIVER got bumped solidly by BEDAZZLING and was forced to steady at the start when pinched in concert with NINETY NINE GEORGE,
raced seven paths off the inside down the backstretch before going five wide through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, angled in to swing
three to four wide for home, ran on to chase the winner home well clear for the place honors. BEDAZZLING came in at the start bumping the
aforementioned foe solidly inwards forcing that rival and NINETY NINE GEORGE to steady out, chased five to six wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun three wide for home and improved position for the show honors. UP FOR ADVENTURE chased four to five wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, flattened out in the late stages. NINETY NINE GEORGE got forced to steady at the start when
pinched between rivals due to mostly pressure outside from BEDAZZLING, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper
stretch and passed tired rivals. LITTERBOX chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then got marooned seven wide through the turn as the field
stacked out, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued seven wide for home and weakened. EIGHT WEEKS LONG chased two to three wide
under coaxing from three furlongs out, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. POLLARD'S DAY forwardly placed five to six paths off the
inside, went five wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths in retreat, swung seven wide into upper stretch and gave way. WAR OF
THRONES dueled from the four path down the backstretch with SCOTTY to his outside, tucked three wide into the turn, began to get shaken off near the
seven-sixteenths, retreated through the turn under coaxing, went four to five wide for home and folded. Please note that due to a winter weather safety
initiative all riders carried an additional two pounds.
