Footnotes
SMIRKOTCH saved ground far off of the pace around the first turn, came under a drive into the far turn as GINGERONMYMIND rallied alongside, steadily
gained ground along with that foe while under all out pressure around that bend, bid for the lead three wide and between horses turning for home, then
kicked clear approaching the furlong pole, and drew off. SAINTE MERE EGLISE bumped the gate at the start but was not costed early position, lied far off
of the pace two wide, gained while shifting three to five wide turning for home, then sustained her rally through the lane to prevail for place over COPPER in
the final stages. COPPER stalked along the inside, loomed large from the pocket around the far turn, but remained blocked behind the pace setter turning
for home, which caused him to be outkicked outer foes in upper stretch, tipped out five wide in midstretch for clear racing room as SAINTE MERE EGLISE
rallied along side, then stayed on inside of that rival, but missed place to that foe. GINGERONMYMIND tracked from midpack along the inside gained
ground two to four wide outside of the eventual winner around the far turn, produced a four wide bid for the lead turning for home, but was outkicked in
upper stretch, then drifted in while tiring through the late stages. HERCULINA lied forwardly placed two to three wide, bid for the lead three wide at the
quarter pole, shifted down two wide turning for home as other foes rallied alongside, then got outkicked by those foes in upper stretch, and faded. BIG
CHEEKS lagged behind the field early on, and was outrun. SASSY CAT established a clear margin into the first turn, backed down the pace into the
backstretch, held an advantage around the far turn, but met a trio of bids turning for home, and weakened in upper stretch. CAPTURED LIGHT lied off of the
pace in the two path, took the far turn three to four wide, and failed to rally. REMARKABLE SILVER stalked two wide while a bit keen around the first turn,
pressed the pace into the backstretch, but gave way between horses passing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
ROSAS WAY bumped with PURECRAZIDUDE at the start, advanced inside entering the turn, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, caught
AYCAPOTE from outside with a furlong remaining and drew off under pressure. AYCAPOTE set the pace inside, was no match for the winner in mid stretch,
and ran on clear of the others. TONS OF GOLD steadied inside midway on the turn, stayed on the rail and rallied mildly. PURECRAZIDUDE was bumped
between horses at the start, raced four wide and could not seriously menace. SAINT LARNED bumped with PURECRAZIDUDE at the start, advanced up
the backstretch, made a run outside AYCAPOTE on the turn, then weakened through the lane on his left lead. RAGS FOR BRITCHES was no factor two
wide. RED FOG bumped with SUPERHIGHWAY at the start, pressed the early pace to midway on the turn, then drifted wide fading into the stretch. MONEY
COME pursued the leaders from outside up the backstretch, and tired after six furlongs. SENZAZIONE stayed in range early, and faded around the turn
while moving out four wide. SUPERHIGHWAY bumped with RED FOG at the start, and was always outrun.

Footnotes
LAMUTANAATTY brushed the gate at the start before being brushed by an outer foe right after, recovered to prompt the pace setter two wide, forged an
advantage from that foe passing the three furlong pole while in hand, held that advantage turning for home as SAINTHOOD ranged up alongside, dueled
inside of that foe after his inner counterpart gave way, got headed passing the furlong pole, but gamely reclaimed the lead approaching the wire.
SAINTHOOD hopped a bit at the start, recovered to chase the pace setters three wide, inched closer turning for home to produce a three wide bid for the
lead outside of LAMUTANAATTY turning for home, dueled while forging a very narrow advantage passing the furlong pole, but was out-gamed to the wire
by his inner rival. DR. DUKE broke sharply, set the pace along the inside while feeling pressure form LAMUTANAATTY, got headed by that foe passing the
three furlong pole, sustained vying position turning for home, but gave way in upper stretch, then proved the best of the rest while staying well clear of
fourth. GRAN RUNNER chased along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the top trio passing the five furlong pole, shifted out turning for home, and held
fourth through the lane. ATLANTIC ROAD trailed the field along the inside, came under an all out drive to gain ground approaching the three furlong pole,
but only offered a mild response while staying on inside of tiring foes through the lane. EIGHTHANDBROADWAY tracked from midpack in the two path
around the turn, but failed to make an impact. POLSAR slightly bobbled and got brushed by an outer foe at the start, lied off of the pace in the four path
around the turn, then weakened. MY LIBERTY stayed in the five path while far off of the pace around the turn, and was outrun.

Footnotes
BLUEGRASS PARKWAY trailed inside to the quarter-pole, moved out getting in gear through upper stretch, finished with a flourish and was up outside
BATTALION to reach even terms at the wire. BATTALION prompted the pace outside MR. TIP, challenged for command at the top of the stretch in the
three-path, kicked clear in deep stretch, then held for a share of the win. PREFECT saved ground in the second flight to the end of the final turn, had aim
outside the leaders through the furlong grounds, got outkicked and was in tight between the top two coming to the finish. DOVER CLIFFS hugged the rail in
striking range for the first mile, slipped through with a bid on the fence in upper stretch but was outfinished. TIL THE END raced two to three wide, and failed
to menace. MR. TIP cut an even pace for a mile, got overhauled from both flanks turning for home, and gave way. COWTOWN was no factor two to three
wide. The mile and a quarter fraction was unavailable.

Footnotes
CANDY MAN ROCKET broke well and prompted the pace two wide after an inner foe rushed forward, allowed that foe to clear off into the turn, stalked from
the three path around the bend before rebidding for the lead passing the three sixteenths pole, blew past the pace setter in upper stretch under driving
pressure, and widened through the final furlong under steady hand urging. JEEBAR rushed after a lack-luster beginning to set the pace after a furlong, drew
off to a clear margin passing the half mile marker, maintained that advantage around the turn in hand while staying a path off of the inner rail, came under
urging as CANDY MAN ROCKET saddled up alongside passing the three sixteenths pole, but offered little resistance to that rival in upper stretch, tired
thereafter, but just held place. BLITZ TO WIN got brushed by an outer rival at the start, rated off of the pace in the two path around the turn, altered course
four wide off of his outer rivals heels straightening into the lane, and offered a stout rally through the late stages to just miss place. PROMISE KEEPER
chased along the inside under mild urging, saved ground around the turn, forged show from an outer foe while proving no match for the leader in upper
stretch, grinded away through the lane in pursuit of the early pace setter for place, but was outfinished by an outer rallying foe in the very late stages.
MYSTERY MO saved ground far off of the pace, and rallied mildly while hugging the fence through the lane. UNTREATED lied off of the pace despite rider
encouragement, shifted down to the inside while coming under driving pressure passing the three furlong pole, but failed to respond while chasing mildly
through the lane. CHROME REPUBLIC hesitated at the start and was last away, lied far off of the pace two wide into the turn, shifted four to six wide in
upper stretch, but lacked a rally. SUMMER SERMON tracked while forwardly placed three wide, but weakened in upper stretch. BOREAS lied off of the
pace three wide around the turn, and weakened.

Footnotes
HENNI PENNY was outsprinted early, swung five wide rallying into the stretch, finished determinedly and was up outside LA CARA BONITA in the closing
yards. LA CARA BONITA advanced around the turn three then four wide, rallied to overtake SWEETSWEETSWEEST leaving the furlong grounds, finished
gamely but could not withstand the top one. YELLEN got shuffled back between COOKIE COVE and JUST SMOK'N early on the turn, moved inside and
lacked room into the stretch, stayed on the fence and finished willingly. SHIKAKA was outrun early, circled widest into the lane and rallied mildly for the last
major share. SWEETSWEETSWEET set the pace inside, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile. MO ME MO MY saved ground outrun to the
stretch, moved to the three-path and gained some ground without threatening. COOKIE COVE pressed the pace two wide to the stretch, and faded. JUST
SMOK'N hit the right side of the gate and came out slowest, rushed up three wide outside the early leaders, and gave way after three furlongs. LADY NOY
was finished early three wide.

Footnotes
SIMOVITCH vied two wide and between horses early on, went on into the turn and dueled inside of BRACKEN while staying a path off of the inner railing,
inched away from that foe passing the quarter pole, and edged further away through the lane. EMPEROR'S CAUSE stalked the leading group from along
the inside early on, tracked the leading duelers from the two path into the turn while holding stalking position, cut the corner turning for home as
SIMOTVITCH inched away, then forged place in midstretch to prove second best. BRACKEN vied three wide and between horses early on, maintained
vying position into the turn and dueled outside of SIMOVITCH around the bend, but failed to keep pace with that foe passing the quarter pole, chased him
thereafter, but lost place in midstretch. AMERICAN DOLLAR prompted the pace six wide leaving the chute, failed to keep pace with inner foes into the turn,
chased the leaders five wide around the bend, then stayed on for a minor share without menacing. SOUND MONEY was off a step slowly, vied five wide
and between horses early on, chased the leaders from the four path around the turn, then faded through the lane. ROSENQUIST gained ground in the two
path around the turn, but flattened out through the lane. SEMINOLE BEACH lied far off of the pace three wide, shifted to the six path turning for home, and
failed to factor. FIRST TASK took the turn two wide while far off of the pace, but was outrun, and eased through the lane. JUNGLE CRY vied along the
inside of a group of rivals early on, but was through after a half. MANITOWISH vied for the lead four wide and between horses, but weakened into the turn,
and was eased through the lane. EYE OF HORUS was outrun throughout and showed little.

Footnotes
CITRUS BURST bumped with BIG DRINK OF WATER at the start, lagged well back early, cut the corner into the stretch, rallied through an ample opening
between the leaders and prevailed under good handling. LONG BLADE raced close up early inside, moved out with aim at the leaders in upper stretch,
finished well and just missed between horses. LEGENDARY PRINCE advanced mildly while moving off the inside approaching the stretch, shifted further
out and was going well late. LIVING VICARIOUSLY vied for command inside BIG DRINK OF WATER, edged away through the furlong grounds, but
weakened the last sixteenth of a mile. BIG DRINK OF WATER bumped with CITRUS BURST at the start, dueled outside LIVING VICARIOUSLY, and
drifted out weakening near the eighth-pole. BOURBON CURRENCY broke a step slowly, raced four wide around the turn, and could not seriously threaten.
GRAN SAMAN raced two wide on the turn, moved inside for the drive and could not gain. CHIEF HOWCOME was no factor three wide. FREEWHEELER
stayed in range three wide early, and tired in the stretch. SILVERLY ENOUGH was always outrun. EMICRACK (CHI) was outsprinted away from the gate
despite hustling tactics inside, and never got close.

Footnotes
JOE DI BAGGIO advanced into the turn to stalk the pace three wide and between horses, forged an advantage approaching the quarter pole, then kicked
clear of rivals in midstretch under mild flagging before being geared down approaching the wire. TOWN CLASSIC stalked two wide and between horses, bid
for the lead approaching the quarter pole as his outer counterpart forged an advantage, then proved no match for him in midstretch. ALL AROUND
advanced to track from midpack four wide into the turn, bid for the lead outside of foes approaching the quarter pole, but failed to keep pace with them in
upper stretch. SOUTH SEA set the pace from the onset, met a trio of bids passing the five sixteenths pole, got headed approaching the quarter pole, and
weakened thereafter. I'M A G SIX trailed early on, advanced past tiring foes into the turn, took the bend in the five to four path after coming under a drive to
keep pace at the three furlong pole, then failed to factor. EXAMINER stalked three wide, but faltered into the turn and was done early. SECRET TOUCH
tracked from midpack along the inside, but weakened into the turn, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
RIDE A COMET was allowed to settle through the opening half-mile, began picking it up three wide around the far turn, responded readily once straightened
away for the drive, collared CASA CREED from outside in deep stretch and edged away. CASA CREED saved ground tracking from close range to the far
turn, moved out to the two-path to go after FROSTMOURNE at the top of the stretch, reached the front from between horses with a furlong remaining, then
could not deny the winner. FROSTMOURNE grabbed the lead with an alert beginning, was forced to gradually increase the tempo through the middle
fractions, could not hold off the top two through the furlong grounds and gave way. HAY DAKOTA got pinched back at the start, improved position four wide
after six furlongs, but made no further headway. FLYING SCOTSMAN was three wide into the first turn, saved ground around the far turn and could not
reach contention. DOCTOR MOUNTY trailed early inside, went two then three wide around the far turn, and lacked the needed response. ADMISSION
OFFICE was outrun inside. TUSK broke outward, pressed the pace outside FROSTMOURNE to the far turn, and was finished before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
GREY CHARLOTTE saved ground from midpack, swung five wide turning for home, and rallied through the lane to edge past the leaders approaching the
wire. TIME SENSITIVE stalked along the inside, loomed awaiting racing room around the far turn, smoothly tipped outside of the pace setter straightening
into the lane, produced a bid in midstretch, but was outfinished by an outer rallying rival. SHE'SANEARTHMOVER cleared the field and angled to the rail
around the first turn, set a pressured pace, repelled pressing foes in upper stretch, dug in as a pair of rivals made bids in midstretch, but was bested by
them approaching the wire. BLUE EYE KITTEN saved ground off of the pace, cut the corner while advancing turning for home, then chased the leaders
through the lane. UNMARKED MONEY was off a step slowly, got caught three wide while far off of the pace around the first turn, steadily gained ground
outside of foes down the backstretch to stalk the pace four wide around the far turn, bid for the lead turning for home, but flattened out in upper stretch
before lugging in late. OUR TEN ANGELS prompted the pace four to two wide into the first turn, then from between horses around the far turn, but failed to
keep pace with his inner counterpart turning for home, and faded thereafter. SMARTY QUEEN stalked five to three wide around the first turn, held stalking
position around the far turn, but yielded between horses turning for home. LA PINTA got rank while off of the pace two wide and between horses around the
first turn, then failed to make an impact thereafter. TAP TAP BIRDIE trailed early on, took the far turn five wide while attempting a rally, but failed to do so.
LEARNT never got involved. FAITH'S A BLUEBIRD lied forwardly placed three to two wide, but was done early.
