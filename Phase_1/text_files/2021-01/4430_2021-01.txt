Footnotes
ROYAL ALEXIS pressed the pace early, inherited a good size lead when WATCH THE FED jumped shadows nearing the three eighths, responded in the
stretch and held driving. WATCH THE FED hustled to the front, jumped shadows nearing the three eighths and took up sharply, regained momentum and
chased the winner to the stretch then was finishing well. THAT'S MY STORY pressed the pace outside the winner, steadied away from WATCH THE FED
at the three eighths, raced two wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. UNUSUAL SECRET had no speed and was trailing then also steadied
when the trouble happened in front of her, eased out into the turn, was five wide to the stretch and finished evenly. BLUE BREEZE was outsprinted early,
checked and eased out into the turn then was not a threat in the drive. KISS OF CONGRATS stalked the pace early, checked at the three eighths, was
three wide then gave way in the drive. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident involving WATCH THE FED at the three eighths and disqualified
that one from second to fourth for interference.

MAYCEE JO zipped clear and angled in, set the pace off the rail to the stretch then responded to pressure and held. MALIBU CAT chased the winner from
the rail to the stretch, eased out slightly, could not impact the winner and dug in late to hold second. CHARGING HOME had no speed, raced two wide to
the stretch, shifted back inside in mid stretch and had a mild late bid. RAELEE also had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch then was outfinished late.
RED DAHLIA chased the winner early, was caught out four wide on the turn, shifted widest for the drive but did not threaten. SURELY A SMILE stalked the
pace four wide to the stretch but was weakening late. BEE EINSTEIN pressed the winner three wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and also
weakened.

HUGE BIGLY was outrun for a half mile, bid three wide into the second turn, swung out widest for the stretch run, rallied determinedly and was up in the last
jump. MULHOLLAND HIGHWAY (IRE) tracked the pace to the second turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then also rallied willingly but was nailed on
the wire. TRASH TALKIN CAT set all the pace racing off the rail, responded when set down for the drive, battled gamely but was nailed by the top two in the
final strides. IRISH DECLARATION broke a bit slow, chased the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch and was gaining willingly late. COOL
YOUR JETS pressed the pace to the half, bid three wide to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. LUCK IS MY NAME had no speed,
raced two wide to the stretch but was tiring in the drive.

Footnotes
PARTY SPIRIT (GB) was well placed off the leaders to the second turn, rallied three wide and pushed away in upper stretch then held driving. MISTY CAT
was settled to the half, bid two then three wide to the stretch, was not a threat to the winner but got the nod for second. BIG WISH had no speed, settled to
the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then also did not impact the winner and missed the place. TURA LURA attended the pace inside a rival
for five furlongs then was outkicked to the stretch and tired. NEW WAYS TO DREAM hustled to contest the pace to the second turn but gave out in the
stretch. ITAINTEASYBEINGRAY stumbled one stride out of the gate then was in tight into the first turn, checked back and trailed throughout.

BIG DUKE was outrun to the turn, raced three wide then eased down to the two path into the stretch, rallied when set down and pushed away under steady
urging. EMMA'S DANCE contested the pace two wide to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then could not stall the winner but held second stubbornly. DO
YOU HEAR THAT got outsprinted early, saved ground to the stretch and advanced to loom a threat to mid stretch then flattened out late. GAYLES
EVENING attended the pace outside EMMA'S DANCE and three wide to the stretch, was outrun to mid stretch and weakened. MANDO broke inward then
bobbled straightening away, trailed to the stretch and was not a factor. CORSICAN chased the leaders three wide to the stretch then faded.

CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE trailed to the backstretch then tried to pull the rider at the five eighths but was settled nicely, circled five wide on the second turn,
rallied when set down and closed steadily to prevail. GETTIN SIDEWAYS had no speed, was two wide to the stretch then shifted out and was gaining
steadily late. NOVELLA pressed the pace to the second turn, bid three wide to get on terms into the stretch, inched away to mid stretch then could not stall
the winner and was nailed late for second. ZIARAH (IRE) was four wide to the backstretch, tracked the pace to the second turn, remained four deep to the
stretch then lacked the needed late response. NORTHWEST FACTOR hustled to show good speed, dueled off the rail for six furlongs but tired in mid
stretch. MYBLUEBELL (FR) chased the pace from the rail to the second turn but gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
HARMON never far back to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then shifted in and rallied through tight quarters in mid stretch, dug in gamely and
just got the nod. MORE POWER TO HIM was settled to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, shifted out for room, shifted out again leaving mid
stretch to be widest of all, rallied determinedly and just missed. OF GOOD REPORT took up away from OUTLAW at the start and trailed to the second turn,
circled rivals five wide to the stretch, rallied to engage the leaders in mid stretch, battled on stubbornly but was bested. MITHQAAL pressed the pace to the
second turn, moved up three wide to duel OUTLAW on the second turn, continued to dig in to deep stretch then was also outfinished. FUENTE (GB) stalked
the pace four wide to the second turn, remained four deep to the stretch, boldly loomed a threat to mid stretch then could not sustain the needed response.
OUTLAW broke inward and crowded OF GOOD REPORT, se the pace two wide to the second turn, dueled into the stretch then was outkicked and tired.
