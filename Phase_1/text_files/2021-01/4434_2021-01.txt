Footnotes
DABZILLA dueled with rival along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the rail through the turn and came into the stretch clear, lugged in early in
the stretch and stayed clear past the sixteenth while proving best. GLITTER GULCH asked for run out of the gate but failed to contend for the lead, tracked
leaders along the rail, continued along the rail and took aim on leader at the head of the stretch along the rail, kept on in the stretch but unable to make
ground on leader. ELEMENTAL dueled for the lead after a good break, continued two wide on the turn and into the stretch, began to fade in deep stretch
and just held on for show in a three way photo. GODDESS APHRODITE stalked leaders two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn and
launched a mild rally in the stretch and just missed third. BARB'S VALENTINE chased duo off the rail in the two path on the backstretch, bid three wide
midway through the turn and drifted into the stretch into the six path, kept on in the stretch and edged for third. IN IT FOR LIFE stalked pacesetters along
the rail on the backstretch, continued to save ground into the turn and into the stretch, failed to launch a rally in the stretch.
