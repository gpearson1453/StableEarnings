Footnotes
SUPER GARNER took immediate control to rate the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, drifted
a bit into the stretch and was steadily handled to the late going before being taken in hand. CHARITABLE SPENNY raced in the two and three paths the
opening turn and picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the three path then dueled through the stretch for
second. IHEARUKNOCKIN settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole and was outfinished in the stretch duel for
second. CARTER'S RUN raced off the rail early on then bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little further. CATCH
MY CABOOSE came through the first turn in the four path and raced outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn still about the four path and showed little more. CUBIC SOUND showed little response through the backstretch and raced in the five
path of the far turn.

Footnotes
UNKISS ME settled off the pace inside then bid nearing the quarter pole, improved at the rail rounding the turn, eased out to split horses leaving the turn
and dug in under steady encouragement to get up later yards. CAT LAK set a pressured pace inside, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the turn
but was caught in later yards and reluctantly ceded. WIGGLE IT JIGGLEIT exchanged contact with KIM'S PET leaving the gate then came further in to
make solid contact with No Stone Unturned, picked up the chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the five path, dug in from the eighth
pole but flattened stride later yards, while the latter of whom, broke awkwardly to exchange contact with Wiggle It Jiggleit and was promptly pinched back on
the chute, gave chase outside, raced in the six and seven paths of the turn and steadily improved down the lane. NO STONE UNTURNED was bumped
soundly at the break and raced boxed in most of the backstretch then bid past the quarter pole, raced in the four path on the turn, steadied from tight
quarters between horses toward the head of the lane then flattened stride. BRASS MAGNOLIA chased outside, rounded the turn in the seven and eight
paths and finished evenly. VINTAGE GIN chased through the backstretch then faded off the rail on the turn. LADY REBEL pressured the pace through the
backstretch and raced close three wide most of the turn, but was carried outward toward the head of the lane and weakened. Following a Stewards inquiry
and subsequent claim of foul against the rider of Wiggle It Jiggleit, lodged by the rider of No Stone Unturned, the steward determined there was no foul.

Footnotes
BRONZE DIVA took over two deep approaching the nine sixteenths pole, raced clear and moved to the inside past the pole and rated the pace, came under
pressure nearing the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the rail, drifted into the stretch, widened under steady handling, though, was taken in hand later
yards. KATALIMA raced off the pace about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and ran three wide on the far turn, but proved no match for the
winner. MY EMMALLY saved ground the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced four
wide on the far turn and was along for third mid-stretch. HOW IS SHE raced well back from early contention then angled out and gave chase into the
backstretch, rounded the far turn in the five path and passed rivals in the lane. DIAMOND TRAIN set the early pace inside but was caught approaching the
nine sixteenths pole, dropped back leaving the first turn, showed little response and faded at the rail nearing the far turn. MISS GRANDSTANDER saved
ground off the pace the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, then weakened. CRUZ IN THE
CASTLE stalked the early pace from the two and three paths, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and
weakened.

Footnotes
GOOFY BOY saved ground through the opening turn and started a bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn, dug in
through the final furlong to take over later yards and was inching further ahead approaching the wire. NOT TELLING stalked from the two and three paths
the first turn then bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead two deep midway on the far turn, dueled clear approaching the top of the stretch but was
met in later yards and reluctantly ceded. YES MEANS NO raced well off the pace in the two and three paths the first turn and entered the backstretch
toward the outside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and was along for third later yards. PERSEVERED raced off
the pace inside then picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail and flattened stride leaving the eighth pole.
TAURIAN rounded the first turn about the four path, entered the backstretch outside and bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the three path rounding
the far turn and showed little further. MISTER CARSON took over nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to set the pace, faded at the rail
rounding the far turn and was caught weakening toward the head of the lane. THE FRANCHISE raced in the six path the first turn and showed little
response through the backstretch. PREACHER'S BAY rounded the opening turn about the five path and was not a factor. DUSKY raced just off the pace
inside the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but faded into the far turn.

BRIDGING THE GAP tapered in to stalk the early pace two deep, challenged toward the three eighths pole and dueled at even terms from that point, took
the nod approaching the quarter, contested the advantage on the far turn and widened through the upper stretch with steady handling. CAMPY CASH raced
in the three path the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off
the rail and dug in to take second mid-stretch. MY LOVELY GIRL angled to the inside to rate the pace, was met at the three eighths pole and dueled at even
terms from that point, gave up the advantage approaching the quarter, raced close at the rail on the far turn, dropped back into the stretch but raced evenly
the final sixteenth. DRINKATTHECREEK rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths, left the turn outside and picked up the chase toward the
three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the five path and passed a rival outside. LIES AND SCANDALS raced in the four path the first turn and
settled into the backstretch, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then flattened out inside the sixteenth.
FOGGY DREAMS showed little response.

GOODLUCKCHUCK rated a slim lead inside, was met at even terms and gave chase into the backstretch, recovered the edge at the five sixteenths pole,
dueled clear into the lane and held on well with steady encouragement. V. I. P. TICKET rounded the opening turn about the three path and settled off the
pace, eased out into the backstretch and bid from the seven sixteenths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, but dropped back into
the stretch and had to settle for second best. ITGOT GRANDMA closed to even terms nearing the three quarter pole and took a brief lead leaving the half
mile pole, was caught toward the five sixteenths, dropped back midway on the far turn and flattened stride. HAYNE'S FEVER raced three wide the opening
turn and stalked from the seven eighths pole, picked up the chase into the backstretch but flattened stride two deep on the far turn. BRUTUS settled off the
pace inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole then faded leaving the far turn. TIZEZZY showed little response through the backstretch.
COMES N THREES raced well off the pace and was never a factor. TAKE TIME rounded the first turn about the three path and settled off the pace from the
seven eighths pole, then faded past the seven sixteenths.

Footnotes
CASTLE OF CAYLEE came away sharply and rated a short early lead inside, was pressured nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the
rail then steadily encouraged to widen. KIM'S DIAMOND settled off the pace inside the first turn, bid nearing the far turn and raced close off the rail on the
far turn though couldn't improve on the winner. STERLINGS MORENA raced in the three path the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid
past the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and finished evenly. CHARITABLE MISS settled back in the two and three paths the first turn and
raced outside into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and flattened out later yards.
SHARP'S MISSION stalked the early pace three wide then two deep into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced close
through the backstretch, came through the far turn in the four path, dropped back toward the head of the lane and weakened. MASTERDANCER rounded
the first turn in the four path, settled off the pace into the backstretch and gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far
turn and weakened into the lane. MARYLEE showed little response through the backstretch. WORKPANSOMETHINGS stalked the early pace two deep
then gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, though, faded at the rail into the far turn.
