Footnotes
DIAMOND AND SILKS showed good speed then moved clear, was coaxed around the turn under extra left rein pressure while along the rail, spun into the
two path into the stretch, responded well when put to a right-handed whip around the three-sixteenths, drifted out late and held under strong urging.
MARIPOSA D'ORO bumped with a rival at the start, moved out while rated off the pace, was let out in the three path on the turn, came four wide into the
stretch, chased the winner under the whip in the drive and finished willingly for the place. BRIGHTNMORNINGSTAR showed speed then chased the pace
on the outside, raced in the three path on the turn, drifted in just inside the quarter-pole and lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show. LINDA
GOT LUCKY settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, altered out from behind horses at the three-sixteenths
and failed to threaten. TWO MORE BARBO showed speed then chased the pace, went around the turn in the two path, dropped back under the whip into
the stretch and tired. FUHRCRY bumped with a rival at the start, dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground under urging on the turn, turned into
the stretch under a right-handed whip, had the rider lose the whip when attempting to switch to the left-hand coming to the three-sixteenths and was no
factor. INNERVOICE broke a bit slow then came outward, settled on the outside, was asked while four wide on the turn then driven five wide into the stretch
under the whip and came up empty. MY HEART DOMINUS was taken up coming to the five-eighths pole then rank under restraint until past the
seven-sixteenths, was let out midway through the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, lugged in off heels at the three-sixteenths and failed to respond.

Footnotes
SOCIAL MISFIT went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, moved closer midway down the backstretch then was taken under restraint,
tugged hard at the bit while taken under more vigorous restraint into the far turn, drafted in the two path on that bend, was given his cue near the
five-sixteenths, came three wide into the stretch then moved out behind the leading duo, rallied on the outside, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole and
narrowly prevailed under strong urging. RIFLE MAN went four then three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, moved closer with five furlongs to run,
drafted two then three wide on the far turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, rallied four wide into the stretch then made a bid at the three-sixteenths,
took the advantage outside the furlong marker, disposed of STAR BANJO outside the sixteenth-pole but was soon challenged by the winner, fought with
that foe to the wire and just missed while clear for the place. STAR BANJO went four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked near
the seven-sixteenths, advanced three to four wide under urging on the far turn, took the lead at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under a drive, lost
the advantage inside the three-sixteenths, fought on with the runner-up until outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened but was clear for the show. LOOKING
FOR BULL went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was asked while three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to
rally. TAKE CHARGE CHASE raced inside to the two path early on the first turn, settled towards the rear, saved ground on the far turn, was asked while
three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. HIDEAWAY HERO went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the inside of a foe,
was asked leaving the backstretch, vied two then three wide under urging on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and capitulated. FLASHY IMAGE broke
out and was taken up some at the start, went four to five wide on the turns and faltered. HANSEN'S HOLIDAY was sent hard to the lead, set the clear pace
on the inside, was challenged midway down the backstretch, lost the lead midway through the far turn and stopped. SENATOR CON acted-up just before
the start then reared very badly, came out well behind the rest of the field and was immediately pulled up then walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY INTO THE START, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

bumped soundly with foes on both sides at the start, was urged along towards the back, dropped from the four to the three path early on the turn, moved to
the two path late on that bend and faltered. TAPIT'S TEMPLE bumped soundly with a rival at the start, settled on the far outside, went six wide on the turn
and failed to respond. BABE REED was taken in hand when the leader crossed in front early, raced towards the front of the field, came up empty in the four
path on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
RIPITTOTHERIGHT went clear early, set the pace in the two path, responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch, came under the whip in the final
furlong and held under strong urging. SOURNOIS raced inside to the two path on the first turn, was rated off the pace, saved ground behind the leaders on
the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, chased under a drive into the final furlong, moved out near the sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage for
the place. RELUCTANT WARRIOR went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the far turn, pursued the winner
under a drive in the stretch and was out-kicked while just able to get the show. BRITTS A CLOSER broke out and hit the gate, angled in towards the rear,
went three wide on the first turn, settled near the middle of the field, went two then three wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, chased
outside into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. OH MY ACHING ARCH went four wide on the first turn, was rated
towards the front on the outside, raced four wide on the far turn, was roused into upper stretch and came up empty. SPECIAL BINGO went five wide on the
first turn, settled on the outside, was urged four to five wide on the far turn then came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LOVE THAT
WARRIOR bumped with a rival at the start, was taken in hand early, became quite rank under stout restraint into the first turn, rounded that bend in the two
path, was reserved off the pace, went three then four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. MY GUITAR bumped with
rivals on both sides at the start then bobbled while pinched back, raced from the two path to the inside on the turns and was no factor. IBEAM was away
awkwardly, went six wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, went four wide while roused on the far turn and also failed to respond.
JENNOVODKA bumped with a rival at the start, went four to five wide on the turns and faltered.

C'MON VE quickly sped clear, extended the advantage while inside on the turn, responded well when put to the whip in upper stretch and remained well
clear under strong urging. BINDING AGREEMENT broke a step slow then bumped the hindquarters of a rival and was taken up, raced off the pace under
urging, went three then four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip, drifted in outside the furlong marker and safely secured the place while
unable to threaten the winner. FAST VERDICT broke a half-step slow, settled towards the rear, saved ground while roused on the far turn and failed to
respond but earned the show. MONEY AND ME bumped solidly with a rival at the start, chased the pace, went three then two wide on the turn and tired.

MR. AL'S GAL bumped with a rival at the start, settled comfortably off the pace, moved closer while inside on the turn, was asked while shifting three wide
at the quarter-pole, rallied on the outside, took the lead outside the sixteenth-pole and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. FAME FEATHER bumped
with a foe at the start, settled at the rear, went around the turn in the two path, was roused at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch,
chased into the final furlong, altered out from behind horses coming to the sixteenth-pole, gained on the outside late and just missed while clear for the
place. NUN OF OURS showed good speed and set the pace off the inside, was guided around the turn in the two to three path then roused outside the
quarter-pole, came under a drive in upper stretch, was headed outside the sixteenth-pole and outfinished while clear for the show. DR LIZ was hustled from
the start, stalked the pace, chased in the three to four path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and had nothing left. ROYAL PRIORITY tracked the
pace on the outside, chased in the four to five path on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
SISTER ANNIE broke out and hit the gate, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the far turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole
and drew clear under strong urging. PEACE BROKER went around the first turn in the two path, set the pace, vied inside while challenged on the far turn,
lost the advantage at the quarter-pole, dropped back into the final furlong, moved out around the sixteenth-pole and just held the place. PAULINE'S PEARL
went four wide on the first turn, was rated towards the front on the outside, chased four wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and just
missed the place while no match for the winner but was clear for the show. CASHEW was well placed just off the pace in the two path, came under urging
on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a strong drive and lacked the needed response. WICKED BISOU saved ground towards the rear under
reserve, was roused while inside on the far turn and failed to rally. HOT AS BLUE BLAZES rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was
asked while dropping from three to two wide early on the far turn, shifted four wide at the five-sixteenths and failed to respond. TAKE CHARGE LORIN was
rank under tight restraint for the opening five=sixteenths then rated off the pace in the three path, came under urging on the far turn and also failed to
respond. DELLA FROST went three to four wide on the first turn, was reserved near the back, dropped from five to four wide early on the far turn and was
no factor. FADED MEMORIES went six then five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked while four to five wide on the far turn and faltered.
