Footnotes
OUR ALIBI vied for the lead from the start, slipped through along the rail to make the lead nearing the quarter pole, set the balance of the pace and edged
clear under brisk handling. CELERITY never far back, bid along the inside into the stretch, angled out two wide before the furlong marker and finished
second best. FRANCO trailed for a half and closed a gap late five wide. HIGHER AUTHORITY broke in front, set the pace in the two path for nearly six
furlongs, remained a sharp threat until deep stretch and was outfinished. STORM ADVISORY chased the pace two wide into the far turn, loomed boldly four
wide before the quarter pole then came up empty. SILVER G T O allowed to settle, moved up three wide into the stretch, was in tight nearing the furlong
marker then weakened. MORE THAN GOOD had speed for six furlongs then wilted.

Footnotes
PABLO CREEK never far back while near the inside, shifted out three wide entering the stretch made the lead inside the furlong marker and finished full of
run to win going away while under mild urging. ROMANTIC JEWEL broke in front, set the pace along the inside until deep stretch then was no match for the
winner. LA CAFETERA pressed the pace two wide and was outfinished. AND I KNOW stalked the early pace, moved up four wide on the far turn then
leveled off. JOPLIN settled mid pack and finished with good courage along the inside. ZANGARVA was no factor. IRISH THUNDER was no threat.
LIGHTNING MISS was always outrun. BETTER THAN PEARLS pressed the pace two wide for four and one half furlongs then gave way. SPECIAL
CONQUEST trailed.

RACINROSEMARY always within striking distance, responded readily when set down, slipped through along the rail through mid stretch and was along in
time. SOPHIE'S ANGEL well placed, had a mild late rally four wide and got up for second. BLACK BUTTE broke in front, set a pressured pace, drifted to the
five path entering the stretch, angled back into the three path and was outfinished. SUN DRESS pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, was carried out
to the six path, made the lead and was outfinished in the final stages. DANZIG RAINBOW failed to menace. GENTLE KISS was no factor. PRADO'S
TRUST was outrun. CALL ME JELLY ROLL had brief speed three wide.

Footnotes
THERESTOFTHESTORY stalked the pace into the stretch, rallied three wide to make the lead late, drifted in a bit and drew off under strong left handed
urging. AWESOME OX broke in front, dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch, steadied and angled outside the winner late and finished clear for
second. HAPPILEA dueled with the runner up from the inside until deep stretch, drifted out over heels under left handed urging near the sixteenth pole,
checked and dropped back. INDIANA RED failed to menace. CALIFORNIA RONE well placed, failed to respond. DAUER had brief speed.
UNCLEJACKOMO broke inward then miss stepped at the start and trailed. THE RIDER OF HAPPILEA LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE
RIDER OF AWESOME OX FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.
