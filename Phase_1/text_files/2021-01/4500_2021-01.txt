Footnotes
COMMISSIONER BIGGS stumbled at the break, circled the turn three wide, gained the lead in upper stretch, opened a clear advantage in mid stretch and
lasted under urging. SEVEN PLUS SEVEN lacked speed, raced two wide on the turn, was caught behind foes in upper stretch, swung to the six path in mid
stretch and rallied outside rivals. COMMANDING GENERAL , four deep on the turn, reached a striking position inside the eighth pole and hung between the
top pair. WHATS THE CHANCES hopped then was shuffled back at the start, steadied when eager to run in traffic leaving the backstretch, raced between
horses in the stretch, flattened out and was steadied on the winner's heels in deep stretch. ISABELLA'S MAGIC lacked speed, was four deep leaving the
turn and failed to be a factor. I'D LIKE TO KNOW set the pace along the inner rail and gave way. TIZ AUCTION TIME , two wide on the turn, chased the
pace and gave way. CHOCLATE BODIE hugged the inner rail chasing the pace around the turn and gave way. TRUE SHIPMAN , no factor, had a rail trip
on the turn.

Footnotes
NINE MARTINIS prompted the pace three wide outside the leader while in hand, moved to a short lead past the five sixteenths, was roused clear soon into
the lane, opened up under a drive in mid stretch then held firm while kept alert. I LOVE YOU tracked the pace four wide, was under urging mid turn, churned
on willingly and held down the place. MARY'S JEWEL , taken to rate off the rail as her stable mate attended to pace, came under coaxing heading towards
the quarter pole, swung six wide and closed belatedly. VIBRANCY settled off the pace and off the rail, was under asking mid turn but lacked a bid. DAT
DARES GOLD , brushed at the break, pulled her way clear early on and set the pace towards the inside, took pressure leaving the far turn, dueled heading
towards the quarter pole then weakened in mid stretch. TAPETE CLAIRE broke outward and brushed with a rival, edged up and stalked inside into the turn,
was under urging nearing the lane but came up empty.

Footnotes
GOLDEN MOON SHINE accelerated to the early, set the pace near the rail, opened up in mid stretch and was kept to her business in the drive. TRICKY
SPIRITS , along the inner rail around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch for clear sailing and closed outside horses. STOP TALKING , four wide
leaving the turn, had a mild advance to mid stretch and flattened out. THUNDER THIGHS , squeezed back leaving the starting gate, raced well off the rail
on the turn, was outrun and passed tired foes late. WHO'S YOUR DADDY , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, weakened. EMPTY POCKETS ,
two wide on the turn, chased the pace to the stretch then gave way. POND HOCKEY , three wide on the turn, was fanned to the six path in upper stretch
and was not a factor. DIGGIN FOR DOUGH hugged the inner rail and weakened.

KEEPER IN SPITE quickly established a clear advantage, was nursed along towards the rail, spurted away from her closest pursuer leaving the three
eighths, increased her lead after being put to a drive inside the three sixteenths, drifted out a bit late and held firm. COUGAR VISION saved ground under
some early rating, angled four wide heading towards the stretch, advanced near mid stretch, lugged in late and held the place. SCAMPER ALONG settled
towards the inside, cut the corner while under asking into the lane, kept on with interest but missed second. ADABEL broke a step slow, raced off the pace
while saving ground, came out late and rallied mildly. THEA'S THEME , bumped at the break, chased three wide, made a mild move mid turn but failed to
sustain in the final eighth. BEAN INDISCREET broke outward and bumped with a rival, circled five wide into the stretch but lacked a serious follow through.
A TOAST TO KAY chased the early pace off the rail, dropped back mid turn, shifted out and came up empty. WORSTBESTIDEAEVER broke alertly but
quickly retreated off the pace, came out in the drive but lacked a rally. EIGHT OAKS , bumped and rank at the break, was taken to rate well back and never
threatened. SUNDAY IN L B C prompted the pace two wide outside the winner, lodged a mild bid around the far turn, failed to keep pace mid turn and gave
way. BIGDADDYSGLORY , wide, dropped back.

BOSS LOGIC stalked the pace, eased out to the three path leaving the turn, bid for the lead outside SHACKLED LOVE near the eighth pole then drove
clear. SHACKLED LOVE , right to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, was challenged in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. NOBODY KNEW , two
wide chasing the pace around the turn, gradually weakened in the drive. TEXAS BASIN saved ground around the turn, remained near the rail in the stretch
and had a slight rally. ERAWAN , three deep around the turn, was outrun. DR. FERBER raced in the two path on the turn and was outrun. BRIBERY ,
outrun, raced along the inner rail on the turn. RRACE DAY WARRIOR dropped back.

ALWAYSMINING settled well off the rail, circled six wide into the lane, closed under strong handling, secured command past the furlong grounds, kicked
clear a sixteenth out and widened late. ZABRACADABRA broke inward and bumped with a foe, stalked four wide outside rivals, bid between foes in upper
stretch, gained a slim lead in mid stretch, gave way grudgingly and just saved the place. SARATOGA JACK chased inside rivals, angled out into the lane,
altered back in for the final furlong and came back willingly. TYBALT stumbled at the break, settled well back, swung very wide for the drive, ranged up in
deep stretch then hung in the final jumps. NOTTOWAY sped clear early, set the pace three wide into the lane, dug in when confronted past the quarter pole,
battled while drifting inside the furlong grounds and faded late. CERULEAN SPRINGS , bumped at the start, saved ground most of the way but lacked a
solid finish. MY FRIENDS BEER settled outside a rival, was under pressure two to three wide into the stretch but failed to muster up a legitimate kick.
HONOR THE FLEET , bumped at the break, tracked between rivals early on, had aim four wide into the lane, steadied when lacking some room past the
three sixteenths then gave way.
