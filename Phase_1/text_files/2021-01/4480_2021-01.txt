SWEET KATHERN good position while outside to far turn, circled field and cleared off in the final furlong. KIKI'S LULU ROSE never far back to far turn, held
up a bit with a late rush but not good enough, settled for the place spot. MI ENLACE unhurried to far turn, ran into trouble and steadied a bit but rallied into
the stretch for the show spot in a good effort. APSARA wide trip throughout, middle move to contend but emptied out in the drive. THE DUTCH ANGLE
never a menace. PIPA PAN improved position. NINJA KITTEN two path close up early, shuffled back and gave way readiy. DEFENDER OF FAITH raced
three wide to far turn to reach contention but dropped back. ROAR OF CALI good inside to duel for three quarters but used up and dropped back. DIMPLES
OF VENUS three wide chase, took over at the half, duel to stretch but came up empty. ANGEL ARMIES off tardy, never a menace.
