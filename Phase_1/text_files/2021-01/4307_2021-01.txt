MOSLER'S IMAGE showed speed, hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to upper stretch then gradually edged away. FEARLESS LASSIE disputed the
pace outside the winner and weakened. SONG OF HONOR , a bit rank leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path around the turn and finished evenly.
THREATEN stalked the pace around the turn, was three deep turning for home and failed to rally. SHERIFF'S KID hugged the inner rail and gave way.
REGAL BILLEE was outrun. LONG DISTANCE LOVE unseated her rider when stumbling at the break. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the start
but no action was taken.

Footnotes
GALLINELLA settled off the rail and off of a contested early pace, circled four wide advancing into the lane, sustained under a drive and got up in the final
yards. STAY OUT vied outside a rival, secured command mid turn, opened up under a drive near the three sixteenths, wandered outward under left handed
rousing in deep stretch and failed to last. TEQUILA FOG , off the pace while saving some ground, eased out around the turn, chased three wide between
rivals nearing the stretch but lacked a solid finish. ALWAYS SOMETHING rated off the early pace, dropped in around the turn, cut the corner into the stretch
but lacked a significant rally. RAGING BLAZE dueled inside on a short lead, lost command past the three eighths, chased into the lane then tired in upper
stretch. PETES PRIDE , in the clear tracking the dueling leaders, was put to pressure two wide mid turn, failed to respond and faltered through the lane.

Footnotes
I'M SO MUNNY hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to upper stretch then drew away under steady handling. SPLENDOR GAL lunged at the break,
raced in the three path in upper stretch and had a mild rally between horses. PROUD MANDATE , four wide leaving the turn, had a slight rally outside
horses. CIAO LUNA disputed the pace outside the winner and weakened late. MARY COSTA saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.
MIDNIGHT CROSSING , five deep entering the stretch, was not a factor. GRECIAN DANCER , outrun, swung to the six path turning for home.

Footnotes
ROYAL NUMBER settled off the early pace while saving ground, moved up into the far turn while in hand, got through along the fence as the leader drifted
out past the three eighths, spurted clear past the five sixteenths then widened under confident handling. SHACKLED LOVE stalked the pace three wide,
took closer order leaving the far turn, failed to go on with the winner past the five sixteenths but continued with some interest to be clear of the rest. NO ONE
TO BLAME , taken to rate off the rail, dropped in past the five sixteenths, pursued into the lane but lacked a solid finish. FULL DINNER JACKET lagged off
the pace, swung wide into the stretch but failed to menace. BANANAS ON FIRE stalked two wide, was lightly steadied between rivals leaving the far turn,
failed to recover and faded in the drive. LAMPLIGHTER JACK cleared early, set the pace towards the rail, got out leaving the far turn affording the winner a
clear path then faltered.

Footnotes
EMBRACE A NEW DAY settled off the dueling leaders while saving ground, eased out leaving the far turn, advanced four wide into the lane, moved
alongside the winner with a furlong to go, responded to left handed stick work and took over a sixteenth out, kicked away and was kept alert. ELOQUENT
LADY rated in range of a three pronged early pace scrum, angled out some then split rivals heading towards the lane, went clear soon into the lane, dug in
when confronted in mid stretch, drifted out and ceded grudgingly in the final sixteenth. WORSTBESTIDEAEVER lacked speed, raced three wide into the
lane and lacked a solid run. SO WHO'S BACK lacked speed, saved some ground mid turn, angled out and failed to rally. BEAN INDISCREET sparred
between rivals early, dueled to the inside of SUNDAY IN L B C leaving the far turn, moved to a short lead mid turn, fought on to upper stretch then faded.
SUNDAY IN L B C had speed three deep, battled outside BEAN INDISCREET around the turn, wandered outward nearing the stretch and gave way.
ANSELMI broke outward, was corrected and sent up inside foes to contest the early pace, eased back off the leading pair heading towards the turn, chased
then weakened before going five furlongs.

Footnotes
NEW FRONTIER sped to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail, opened up entering the stretch then dug in tenaciously late to hold sway.
TRUSTYOURINSTINCT stalked the pace around the turn, was well positioned three wide at the head of the stretch and rallied outside the winner. HELLO
AMIGO saved ground on the turn, eased out to the two path for the stretch run and finished evenly. CHAUFFEUR lacked speed, swung to the four path in
upper stretch, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. PRINCE PERE , three deep on the turn, weakened through the stretch. MR. SHADES OF GRAY
stumbled leaving the starting gate, checked in tight quarters entering the turn, raced along the inner rail and weakened. HONOR MY WORLD trailed.

Footnotes
GIFTED HEART had speed to the inside of a rival, rated back off and angled out nearing the turn, bid three wide to engage with a quarter to go, dueled,
gained command past the three sixteenths, kept on under a drive and went clear at the line. DEEP RED settled off the pace, circled four wide into the lane,
closed steadily and just got the place. BUNTING vied outside rivals, went clear near the half mile marker, dropped in to set the pace towards the rail, dug in
when collared approaching the lane, dueled inside the winner to mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. FIFTEEN ROYALS , taken to rate, moved up four
wide into the stretch then flattened out. DOCTORSOFMISCHIEF saved ground and faded. CHOCOLATE SPEIGHTS broke a bit slow, raced two wide
between foes and weakened.

YEYETZI sprinted to the early lead, hugged the inner rail throughout and was kept under pressure in the drive. SAND IN MY SHOES bobbled at the break,
chased the winner while two wide around the turn, drifted in near the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. CAPRICHOSA saved ground around the turn,
remained near the rail in the stretch, altered course near the sixteenth pole and was gaining late. TOP HAT BOSS , three wide on the turn, steadily retreated
the final three furlongs. SHUFFLEBOARD trailed.
