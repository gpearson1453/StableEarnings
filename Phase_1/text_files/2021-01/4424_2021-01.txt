Footnotes
MOONLIGHT GRAHAM, forwardly placed three deep in the opening stages, tracked just off the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the turn, advanced to
press the issue in the three path in upper stretch, shifted inwards leaving midstretch while moving to gain a narrow advantage and narrowly prevailed
between foes under firm encouragement. THROWN FOR A LOUPE, urged inside the pacesetter prompting that rival in the opening stages, tracked just off
that foe into the bend, came through along the rail in upper stretch to lodge his bid and was just outkicked. MARKET tracked off the first flight outside foes in
the opening stages, shifted to the four path racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap on the top pair late. ALMONASTER broke
readily, was urged to the lead a bit off the rail dictating the pace between foes on a narrow advantage, briefly resisted the winner's challenge racing into
upper stretch, then was steadied out of tight quarters in late stages while giving way. CAPTAIN FUN angled to the inside in early stages tracking off the first
flight, but steadily faded nearing the lane. BIZ NOW, off slowly, never gained contention. IAMMAJESTICRED proved no factor. FOLLOWING THE RACE
THE RIDER OF ALMONASTER LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH WHICH WAS
DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
BATTLE RAGS broke readily, tracked just outside the pacesetter racing to the turn, continued with a steady bid to wrest the advantage from that foe nearing
midstretch and held WHO IS JARETT to the end under brisk handling. The latter tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside racing to the turn, shifted
three wide entering upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap to the end. STERLING ICE broke sharply, was urged dictating the pace on a clear
margin while angling to the inside racing into the turn, resisted the winner into the lane but yielded to the top pair late. YEUDIEL tracked off the second flight
between foes in the opening stages, shifted four wide racing into upper stretch but could make no real impression. EL FEFO broke outwards bumping FED
XMAN, was settled last while shifting off the inside but passed only tiring rivals. EL SOLO UNO was rated off the second flight outside foes in the opening
stages, was prompted to make brief progress three wide racing into the turn but drifted wide racing into the lane while giving way. FACTOR MAN settled
outside foes in the last flight, angled inwards on the turn but lacked a closing response. FED XMAN, off slowly, then bumped at the start, soon dropped out.

Footnotes
SOARING BIRD, forwardly placed inside rivals in the opening stages prompting the pace, shifted a bit off the rail entering the bend dueling for command
inside a rival to gain a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch and edged clear from between foes in late stages under firm handling. ACTION
WARRIOR tracked just off the first flight three deep between foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside nearing upper stretch, bid for command
nearest the rail approaching the furlong marker but proved only second best. SEMINOLE WARRIOR, unhurried outside foes while in touch with the first
flight racing through the backstretch, continued four wide into upper stretch while moving to close the gap and edged a rival for a share late. LARGE, urged
to a clear lead between calls after the start racing in the three path on the backstretch, dueled for command outside the eventual winner, then between foes
into upper stretch and gave way late. UNION APPRECIATION hopped at the start while breaking slowly, shifted in while being urged between rivals
prompting the pace on the backstretch but emptied out early.

Footnotes
GRAY BEAU was rated between foes tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, conceded some position under patient handling nearing the far
turn, shifted four wide nearing upper stretch to split foes advancing on the pacesetter, then wrested the advantage and edged forward in time under firm
handling. IRISH MAJOR tracked the pacesetter inside foes as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, advanced along the rail on the far turn to
bid for command inside foes nearing upper stretch, gained a brief lead racing into the lane but couldn't fend off the winner. BOXER BOY, caught four wide
as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, continued with a steady effort while being fanned five wide into upper stretch and edged rivals for a
share. KALEIDOSCOPE KID settled off the second flight racing just off the inside racing to the backstretch, came through close quarters splitting foes racing
into upper stretch, but lacked the needed final kick. TIP SHEET, forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch,
advanced to press the issue on the far turn but flattened out leaving midstretch. THANK YOU settled outside foes in early stages, raced five wide into the far
turn, was fanned six wide into upper stretch and had no closing response. GRINGO STAR broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing off
the inside to the far turn and gave way abruptly entering the lane.

Footnotes
JADA'S KINGDOM broke sharply, angled to the inside leaving the chute disputing the pace inside a rival, dueled for command on a narrow advantage to
upper stretch, shifted out under left handed pressure into the path of RANSOMS REWARD leaving the sixteenth marker but maintained a clear advantage
to the end. EASTER CHOCOLATE switched just outside the leaders tracking those foes as part of the second flight on the backstretch, was urged to
advance three wide racing into upper stretch and came through some traffic late to prove best of the others. RANSOMS REWARD angled inwards
prompting the eventual winner's pace on the backstretch, pressed the issue to midstretch, then was carried out in late stages while coming up empty.
BETO'S GIRL was rated just off the second flight between foes near the inside early, shifted out entering the turn, was fanned four wide midway through the
bend and continued in that path to late stages while steadily improving position. CROSS THE MERSEY tracked off the first flight along the inside in the
opening quarter, switched out racing into the turn to race three wide into the lane but came up empty in the drive. GLOBAL QUEEN COCO settled outside a
rival in the last flight early and never gained contention. DOSHA tracked off the first flight four wide racing through the backstretch and steadily faded racing
into the turn. DREAM TO WIN proved no factor. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF RANSOMS REWARD LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
CLADDAGH'S RUN tracked off the second flight three deep racing to the backstretch, made a steady advance on the pacesetter in that path racing into the
far turn, shifted inwards wresting the advantage entering upper stretch, then turned back a challenge from INHONOROFOWENJR in the closing stages to
edge forward under firm handling. The latter, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, switched out racing through the far turn, was prompted to
advance four wide into the lane, gained terms with the winner in the closing stages but couldn't match that rival's final kick. KATZ YOU LATER angled to the
inside tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted outside a rival to gain position between foes nearing upper stretch but lacked the
needed final kick. CLOVER BEACH, shuffled out of tight quarters racing through the tight chute, settled well off the leaders to the far turn, then steadily
improved her position four wide between foes into the stretch. MOMS LOVE settled outside foes dropping off the second flight, was fanned six wide into the
lane and made no impression. V K LEGACY tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch and faded into stretch. BIG ANNIE tracked just off
the pacesetter inside a rival as part of the second flight racing to the far turn and came up empty nearing the lane. CANTERBURY GOLD sped to the lead,
dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn and gave way into the lane. DREAMER'S GETAWAY broke slowly, trailed the field to the far turn and
proved no factor. BOSTON GIRL, urged to a forward placing just outside the pacesetter racing to the first turn, continued three deep into the backstretch
and emptied out abruptly after a half.

Footnotes
OLYMPIC ROMP, firmly rated near the inside tracking just behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, made a steady gain along the rail racing into
upper stretch to bid for command inside the pacesetter in tandem with BOW AND ARROW, edged forward of that foe under firm pressure and was taken in
hand nearing the wire once the issue was decided. The latter was rated off the second flight a bit off the inside racing to the far turn, swung four wide
midway through the second bend while being prompted to advance, bid for command three deep in tandem with the winner leaving midstretch while being
brushed by the pacesetter and was just outkicked. THE STIFLER, urged to gain a clear advantage shifting off the inside racing to the backstretch, turned
back a rival's challenge after a half to regain a clear advantage on the far turn, held sway racing off the rail to upper stretch, shifted out brushing a rival while
being headed late and yielded to the top pair. IT'S MANDATORY settled last to the backstretch and passed tiring rivals racing into the lane.
CONTRAFLOW, urged to a forward placing three deep tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight, continued in that path into the far turn and
steadily faded into the lane. BRICE, urged to a forward placing between foes tracking the pacesetter, was urged to prompt that rival through the backstretch,
steadily lost ground to that foe racing into the far turn and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
LAKE PARIMA broke readily to gain a forward placing, came under rating to stalk the leaders along the rail racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide
racing into upper stretch and produced a steady late response to wrest command and go clear under firm handling. LEXOPHILIA was rated outside a rival
as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced on the pacesetter to bid for command midway through the far turn, lugged inwards a
bit despite correction racing into upper stretch, couldn't contain the winner but edged rivals for the place honors late. BOASTFUL CONTESSA angled
inwards to track off the second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, split foes, then shifted four wide racing through upper stretch and continued
with an effort to prevail for a share. REAL WILD SOLUTION, urged prompting a rival's pace racing into the backstretch, pressed the issue gaining a narrow
advantage racing into the far turn, resisted when challenged nearing upper stretch but gave out leaving the furlong marker. SNIPER SIS tracked off the
second flight while caught wide racing to the backstretch and lacked a rally. MAGIC FINNISH settled near the inside early and never mounted a serious
challenge. LASTING JOY shifted three wide early tracking the leaders just behind the second flight in the opening half and steadily faded into the lane.
LITTLE MS BROADWAY, urged to the lead while angling to the rail leaving the chute, pressed the issue inside a rival to the backstretch and was spent after
a half. BIZNESS BEAUTY, off a step slowly, trailed the field to the stretch. CAN'T KATZ HER, reserved inside foes in the opening stages, switched out four
wide racing to the backstretch and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
COCHISE CHARLIE, in touch with the pacesetter from the outset prompting that foe, pressed the issue racing into upper stretch to go clear and just held
several challengers under firm left handed pressure to narrowly prevail. BEACH WARRIOR angled inwards tracking just off the first flight racing to the turn,
shifted out three wide in upper stretch and continued willingly between foes to just miss. ESTILO VARONIL broke in the air, was righted to track off the
second flight racing four wide into the turn, shifted out five wide in the closing stages but was going well late to close the gap on the top pair. LIL GREEN
MACHINE broke readily, tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed final kick.
UNCLE CHARMING was rated off the second flight while shifting inwards in early stages, was held up momentarily racing in close quarters on the turn, then
shifted three wide racing into the stretch while finishing evenly. D TACHYON angled to the inside early tracking off the second flight, saved ground to upper
stretch but offered no rally. MANUKA BOBBY settled between foes in the last flight and failed to menace. UPRISE dropped out last early and never
menaced thereafter. GOOD BOY ROY, urged along the rail disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way entering upper stretch.
