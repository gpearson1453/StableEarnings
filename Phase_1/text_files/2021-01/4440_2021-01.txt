Footnotes
PRIVATE ASTRAY tracked off the first flight outside a rival from out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, commenced a steady advance three wide
racing into the far turn to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage approaching midstretch and went clear under firm
encouragement. TOMMY TUESDAY tracked well off the first flight inside the eventual winner in the opening half, steadily gained position between foes in
tandem with the eventual winner racing into the far turn, switched out of close quarters to race three wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady
effort to prevail for the place honors. CUP GAME switched off the inside early tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, then steadily improved
position between foes just off the inside in the closing stages to prevail for a share. ON DUTY ducked out at the start brushing ERIN GO BRAUGH, was
urged to gain a clear lead racing a bit off the rail to the backstretch, turned back a rival's challenge after a half to hold sway into the far turn, but gave way
once headed by the winner late. PARADE GRAND, off slowly, settled off the second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, angled five wide
entering the lane and continued evenly. ERIN GO BRAUGH, brushed at the start, was urged to a forward placing between foes tracking just off the
pacesetter, advanced to press the issue midway through the backstretch and emptied out racing through the far turn. CHANNEL MAN, off slowly, settled
well off the field and never gained contention. JUST LIKE DUNCAN, urged to forward placing three deep tracking just off the leaders racing to the
backstretch, emptied out abruptly entering the far turn.

Footnotes
SUNDRENCHED was urged to gain the lead inside a rival racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a clear margin into the backstretch, resisted when
challenged racing through the far turn to upper stretch, was headed midstretch but shifted out under left handed pressure in the closing stages bumping
MINEWELLRECEIVED to narrowly prevail in an all out drive. The latter broke sharply, stalked just off the pacesetter, racing to the backstretch under light
rating, was urged to press the issue between foes racing through the far turn to upper stretch, struck the front midstretch, then was bumped nearing the wire
while just failing to contain the winner. TEGLA was rated just off the leaders shifting out three wide racing to the backstretch, advanced to press the issue in
that path racing through the far turn but came up empty entering upper stretch. FOOT RUB LOVE tracked the leaders three, then four wide off the second
flight racing to the far turn but offered no rally. ATHENASWAY angled to the inside tracking behind the second flight racing to the backstretch and steadily
faded on the far turn. BIZ MAKER, a bit outpaced while settled last to the backstretch, angled five wide entering the lane but proved no factor. FOLLOWING
THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN WHILE THE RIDER OF MINEWELLRECEIVED LODGED A
CONCURRENT CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
SPEED SALSA, off a step slowly while being cut off at the start, quickly regained contention while being urged along the rail to a position just inside the
pacesetter racing into the turn, made steady progress inside that foe to wrest the advantage racing through upper stretch and edged clear under firm
handling. BILLYSBIRTHDAYGIRL veered out sharply at the start crossing the paths of SPEED SALSA and PATRICIA H, set the pace in the three path
racing to the turn, continued to dictate terms off the rail to upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner in the drive. RUN AWESOME TIZ, urged to a forward
placing three wide tracking just off the pacesetter, lost some ground to the top pair while shifting inwards crossing the path of PATRICIA H entering the lane
and soon gave way. PATRICIA H, off slowly, recovered quickly to gain a position between foes in second flight, was held up avoiding close quarters racing
into the bend, angled inside nearing the lane, then altered course entering upper stretch when losing her path but lacked any further late response.
STARSHIP PRANKSTER tracked off the first flight racing four wide into the turn and steadily faded into upper stretch. BLAZING DIVA settled outside foes
racing to the turn and failed to menace thereafter. R B C GOLD broke slowly, angled to the inside early racing as part of the last flight but proved no factor.
RONNIE settled between foes and dropped out early.

Footnotes
QUALITY STEP tracked the leaders from out of striking distance outside a rival as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled four wide after a
half, was prompted to advance three wide racing into the far turn to wrest command racing into upper stretch, went well clear in the lane and was kept to
brisk encouragement. SHENDAM (FR) worked his way to the inside early, while settling well off the leaders, gained position inside foes after a half, then
between rivals racing through the far turn, shifted back to the inside in the closing stages and continued with interest to edge a rival narrowly for the place
honors. KITTEN'S SPA was settled last racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes nearing the far turn, advanced four wide through the second bend
to upper stretch and was just outkicked for second. HOT AND HEAVY, forwardly placed three wide, shifted on the first turn to force the pace outside a rival
racing into the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes into the far turn and emptied out entering upper stretch. MR. PAPILLON tracked the leaders
inside a rival as part of the second flight, continued between foes into the far turn, swung five wide racing into upper stretch but made no real impression.
THE BOSS FACTOR sped to the lead outside a rival leaving the chute, angled to the rail dictating the pace into the first turn, dueled for command inside a
rival through the backstretch to the second bend and gave way nearing upper stretch. GLAD ROCK (GER), forwardly placed along the rail in the opening
stages, was eased off the leaders nearing the backstretch and steadily retreated after a half.

Footnotes
ROYALBONNIELEGACY angled to the inside early tracking the pacesetter inside foes as part of the second flight, was eased back off the pace to drop out
last nearing the far turn, swung out five wide nearing upper stretch, then produced a stout rally in that path through the closing stages to prevail in time
under firm right handed pressure. ALEXBABE, off a step slowly, settled off the second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out entering
the far turn, was prompted to advance four wide on the second bend to upper stretch steadily gaining terms with the pacesetter leaving midstretch but was
outkicked by the winner. STATED sped to the lead while angling over racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a comfortable a margin a bit off the rail
racing into the far turn, resisted when challenged in late stages but couldn't fend off the top pair. QUIET NO MORE settled outside a rival in the last flight
racing to the backstretch, shifted out racing four, then three wide into the far turn gaining position between foes nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed
final kick. SAPPHIRE JUBILEE tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight, angled inside after a half, saved ground on the far turn and faded into
the lane. NIGHT WATCH tracked the pacesetter three deep between foes in second flight to the backstretch and faded after a half. KISS THAT DUDE, off a
bit slowly, was prompted to gain contention while caught four wide racing into the first turn, continued in that path to the backstretch, shifted inwards a after
a half to lodge a brief bid racing into the far turn but soon emptied out.

EYE ON THE FINISH, was held up just off the leaders along the inside leaving the chute, steadied slightly after clipping heels racing into the first turn,
continued to tracked the leaders inside foes to the far turn, advanced along the rail when presented an opening in upper stretch and narrowly prevailed on
the wire under firm encouragement. COLONELS DAUGHTER, reserved off the second flight while angling inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out
nearing upper stretch, angled out five wide in the lane to split foes and continued willingly in the closing stages to close the gap while edging a rival for the
place honors. CLASSY OF COURSE, in touch with the leaders three deep attending the pace to the backstretch, pressed the issue in that path on the far
turn into upper stretch to gain the advantage nearing the furlong marker but was collared by the top pair late. POSTINO'S IDOL, in touch with the pacesetter
while just inside that rival attending the pace under light rating racing to the backstretch, pressed the pace inside foes racing into the far turn, dueled for
command while shifting off the inside in upper stretch, then weakened late. MAGIC HATTER settled last dropping well off the field racing to the far turn,
swung out five wide entering the stretch and gained some position between foes late. LUCY'S TOWN tracked the leaders three deep just off the second
flight racing to the backstretch, was caught five wide on the far turn to upper stretch and offered no rally. CARIBBEAN KITTEN tracked off the first flight
between foes in the opening half, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch but couldn't produce a closing bid. BETTYB went to lead outside a rival racing
through the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin between foes into the backstretch, dueled between rivals on the far turn to upper stretch and gave
out nearing the furlong marker.

Footnotes
ELGAR was pulling a bit under rating between foes stalking just off the leaders racing through the backstretch into the turn, shifted to the four path entering
upper stretch and produced a steady late response to wrest the advantage under firm right handed pressure. FIRE MARSHALL BILL, off a bit slowly, quickly
recovered to track off the pacesetter inside rivals racing into the turn, shifted out three wide in upper stretch and continued with interest between foes to
prevail for the place honors. FIVE OF HEARTS, in touch from the outset attending the pace under light rating racing to the turn, advanced to press the issue
nearing upper stretch, gained the advantage leaving the furlong marker but couldn't fend off the top pair. ZORB bobbled at the start, quickly recovered to
gain the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing into the turn, dueled for command into upper stretch and yielded leaving the
furlong marker. DISTURBINGTHEPEACE, in touch with the first flight tracking just off the leaders three deep racing to the turn, drifted to the five path
entering upper stretch and quickly gave way.

Footnotes
THE CONNECTOR angled to the inside tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance racing into the turn, steadily gained on the leaders in tandem
with a rival nearing upper stretch, shifted out to bid between rivals nearing midstretch, wrested the advantage while shifting to the three path but went clear
under firm handling. JAZZY TIMES was hustled up the rail forcing the pace inside a rival racing into the turn, edged clear in upper stretch but couldn't fend
off the winner while narrowly prevailing for the place honors. FOX ROX broke outwards brushing CHESS MASTER, was righted to track off the second flight
between foes in the opening stages, angled to the rail entering the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and continued willingly inside foes to late stages to
just miss for second. CHESS MASTER, brushed, while caught in tight quarters just after the start, tracked off the second flight outside foes racing into the
turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and continued with some interest to gain some position. QUARKY angled in sharply just after the start while being
urged to gain a position tracking the leaders outside a rival, steadily drew into striking distance shifting out three, then four wide racing into upper stretch and
lacked the needed final kick. DERBY CITY settled between foes dropping well off the leaders racing to the turn, angled to the inside entering the stretch but
failed to mount a serious challenge. HENRY'S WORLD broke sharply, was urged prompting the pace outside a rival in the opening stages, dueled for
command racing into the turn and gave way abruptly in upper stretch. JARETH was slow to gather stride and never mounted a serious challenge.
SIMMARDSTRIKE tracked off the second flight along the inside in the opening stages but dropped out early.

STRIKING HEIR prompted the pace inside foes racing through the backstretch, edged forward to a narrow advantage while shifting out racing into upper
stretch, widened the advantage under pressure and held sway on a clear margin to prove best. WAR GIANT tracked just off the first flight between foes near
the inside in the opening stages, angled to the rail entering the turn and continued in pursuit of the winner while shifting out late proving best of the others.
SUSPECT A STORM, forwardly placed four wide prompting the pace through the backstretch into the turn, shifted inwards a bit to bid racing into upper
stretch but lacked the needed final kick. STEEL SHOT tracked off the first flight racing five wide into the turn, continued in that path to upper stretch, then
angled to the inside in late stages while continuing with interest between foes. STONE HANDS, held up avoiding close quarters just after the start, angled to
the inside and steadily improved position in the closing stages. PREFERRED OUTCOME vied for command three wide between foes through the
backstretch into the turn and gave way leaving midstretch. OHANZEE, urged between foes prompting the pace from the outset into the turn, was through
after a half. COMBAT CONTROLLER dropped out early. ROCKYSBUCKAROO tracked off the first flight three deep between foes racing to the turn but
gave way early.

Footnotes
BLUE CAT was rated dropping off the second flight while angling inside racing to the first turn, switched out nearing the second bend, advanced five wide,
then four wide racing into the lane and responded to firm left handed pressure to take charge, then kick clear proving best. STAND WITH MO angled to the
inside racing to the first turn tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight, switched out racing into the lane advancing on the pacesetter and edged
rivals for the place honors. THE BEST DISTANCE sped to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a clear margin into the
backstretch, maintained that margin to upper stretch and gave out late. RUMELI, caught wide leaving the chute, shifted inwards racing to the backstretch
tracking off the second flight, was steadied momentarily when caught in close quarters midway through the backstretch, as prompted to advance four wide
into the second bend, steadily gained position three wide nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. LOVE LIFE settled into stride while angling
inside early, shifted out to gain some position between foes racing into the far turn, steadied in close quarters midway through the second bend and
continued to gain some position late while proving no real threat. BOCA GUY switched off the inside early while pulling a bit tracking just off the pacesetter
between foes, continued three deep between foes to the far turn and faded into the lane. WILTON tracked just off the pacesetter between foes in second
flight to the backstretch and steadily faded into the far turn. BLACK V. K., caught four wide racing to the first turn, tracked off the second flight outside foes to
the backstretch but retreated early. CORRELATE proved no factor. THRU THE VINE was off slowly and trailed throughout.
