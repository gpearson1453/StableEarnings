Footnotes
MR. FOUR SEVENS broke alertly then was hustled, angled quickly towards the inside and forced two foes inward, saved ground on the first turn, moved out
at the nine-sixteenths, rallied in the four path on the far turn, closed well to get the lead into upper stretch, shook clear into the final furlong while driting
about and prevailed under strong urging. BAYOU JAM was forced in by the winner early then taken up briefly, raced inside early on the first turn then shifted
to the three path, settled outside on the backstretch, was roused in the five path on the far turn, turned into the stretch under a drive, pursued the winner in
the final furlong and finished willingly for the place. STANDING MAN went to the front, set the pace in the pace, vied inside of a foe under strong urging on
the far turn, passed the quarter-pole under the whip, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. RICHIE GARY was last
to commence, went three to four wide on the turns, floated seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. J C'S IN TOWN veered out at the start then
was hustled, raced in the three path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid at the three-eighths pole, vied in the three path on the far
turn, dropped back into upper stretch and came up empty. SIR POKERFACE was forced in by the winner early then taken in hand, rounded the first turn in
the two path, settled off the pace, struck the rail leaving the backstretch, saved ground while ridden along on the far turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
FLAGS UP broke alertly and went straight to the front, showed the way in the two path through the turn, was coaxed along passing the five-sixteenths, came
in a bit when switching leads just inside the quarter-pole then bumped with EASTSIDE COOL, was pulled off that foe by the rider with tugs of the right rein,
responded well while battling outside the aforementioned foe in the final furlong and gamely prevailed. EASTSIDE COOL was well placed just off the pace,
saved ground on the turn, moved up to make a rail bid into the stretch then was bumped by the winner, fought inside that foe in the final furlong and couldn't
get by while clear for the place. OLYMPIC CHAMPION settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the turn then driven three wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. GOLD INCENSE was hustled from the start, tracked the pace on the outside then three
wide on the turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under a drive then came under the whip, dropped back outside the furlong
marker and tired. FLAT OUT AMERICAN was off slow and spotted the front between two and three lengths, raced on the outside at the rear under urging,
went five then four wide on the turn, floated six wide into the stretch then drifted in around the three-sixteenths and failed to respond. DEVIL'S FIRE was off
a step slow, became very rank under steadying restraint early, steadied repeatedly until being moved out at the nine-sixteenths, leveled out around the
seven-sixteenths, was urged four wide on the turn, chased five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, FLAGS
UP WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR INTERFERENCE INSIDE THE QUARTER-POLE

THEBOYZGALAXY brushed with a foe at the start, went three wide early on the first turn, was forced four then five wide midway through that bend then was
taken up while pinched back, dropped in entering the backstretch then moved further in,, settled well off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and came up
empty while best of the rest. DANCE AWAY brushed with a rival at the start then was hustled, started the turn in the two path then climbed behind horses,
shifted four wide shortly thereafter, settled in third position down the backstretch, was urged three wide on the far turn, drifted out significantly in upper
stretch and capitulated. I DONT KNOW EITHER broke out at the start, saved ground on the first turn, moved out early on the backstretch, settled well back

advantage outside the quarter-pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, drifted in just inside the three-sixteenths, drew off under the whip into the final furlong,

under extra left-rein pressure into the first turn then dropped to the five path, settled near the back, moved out near the half-mile pole, advanced five then
four wide on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. PLATINUM QUEEN went around the first
turn in the two path, was rated off the pace, came under urging while inside to the two path on the far turn, shifted out into upper stretch and came up empty
while best of the rest. LUCKY LINDA was sent hard to the front, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, set the pace, vied inside under urging while
challenged by the winner on the far turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole and tired. KITTENOFTHE COURT went three wide on the first turn, was
urged along towards the rear, raced three then two wide on the far turn, dropped well back while still under the whip until inside the furlong marker and was
distanced. WORLD WAR broke out at the start, brushed with a foe nearing the first turn, went five wide on that bend, settled on the outside, was through
after a half-mile and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off. OPPS MY BAD brushed with a rival nearing the first turn, went four wide on
that bend, was forwardly placed on the outside, came up empty leaving the backstretch, retreated four to five wide on the far turn and was also eased in the

Footnotes
QUIKFAST N AHURRY was taken up early, raced on the outside while coaxed along, advanced four then three wide to make a bid on the turn, took the
lead at the quarter-pole then edged clear under a drive in upper stretch, responded well in the final furlong and held under strong urging. GOULDING was
well placed just off the pace, shifted from the rail to the two path early on the turn, came three wide into the stretch then tipped further out, chased the
winner into the final furlong and finished willingly for the place. GIANNA'S GIFT was away alertly from the outside post, moved in while going clear early,
showed the way while inside through the turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and weakened but was clear for
the show. AMERICAN LEGEND chased the pace, dropped back some leaving the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into
the stretch and lacked the needed response. TWIRLING DIAMOND checked in the early going, raced five then four wide on the turn and also lacked the
needed response. LOVE OF MY HEART bumped with a rival early, was rated between horses while tugging hard at the bit, was let out three then four wide
on the turn then driven five wide into the stretch and came up empty. ZEBECCA bumped with a rival early then was taken in hand, raced under a tight hold,
dropped back leaving the backstretch, was let out four to five wide on the turn, drifted in near the furlong marker and failed to respond.

Footnotes

stretch and held under strong urging. ACTIVE GIRL leaned in at the start and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, settled towards the rear, went
three then two wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, shifted in while gaining around the sixteenth-pole and finished with good energy
for the place. CUSTOM FOR CARLITA chased the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch
and was outfinished while clear for the show. MONARCHOS PRAYER was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed kick. TOODALOO TO YOU broke a half-step slow, settled in the middle of the field, raced inside to the two path on the turn,
was driven three wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to rally. WAR BANDIT broke a step slow, settled at the rear, went six wide on the
turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. FLAT OUT BIG MONEY dropped well off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came five wide
into the stretch and failed to threaten. FLASH HANDS broke a half-step slow, settled on the far outside, went five wide under urging on the turn then came
six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. CHERRY TWIST was well placed just off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on
the turn and came up empty.
