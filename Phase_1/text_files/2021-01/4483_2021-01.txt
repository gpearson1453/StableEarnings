Footnotes
BEAUTIFUL BELLA broke a bit slow, swerved out behind an awkward traveling foe nearing the first turn, went four then three wide on that bend, settled
towards the rear, rounded the far turn in the two path, was roused while swinging four wide into the stretch, rallied under a left-handed whip, closed well to
make a bid into the final sixteenth and got up under vigorous handling. GOINGTOAGOGO brushed the inside of the gate at the start, was taken in hand
early then well placed on the inside, moved off the rail early on the far turn then shifted three wide later on that bend, rallied to the lead in upper stretch, was
asked for her best outside the furlong marker, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. I GOT WINGS angled in
early, lost action and very awkward strides into the first turn then was taken up, dropped from the three path to the rail on that bend, settled at the rear, was
urged three wide on the far turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the show. BEE HOUSE became rank early then lugged out into
the first turn, went three to four wide on that bend, remained hard to handle early on the backstretch then leveled out some, chased four wide on the far turn,
came six wide into the stretch under the whip and lacked the needed response. CRAZY GOOD went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, set
the pace, was challenged early on the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then lost the advantage outside the
three-sixteenths and gave way. ANNIE'S SHENANIGAN was carried four to five wide on the first turn, moved up on the outside early on the backstretch to
contest the pace, was asked in the two path on the far turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired. (Rail at 17 Feet)

Footnotes
ZANESVILLE went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, inched closer in the three path on the far turn, made a bid outside the
five-sixteenths, came under the whip turning into upper stretch, took a narrow advantage into the final furlong, drifted out under heavy pressure late and
narrowly prevailed under strong handling. WOMAN WITH A BOOK saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, started the far turn in the two path,
was roused while shifting three then four wide late on that bend then was driven five wide into upper stretch, chased two foes into the final furlong, gained
into the final sixteenth and just missed while clear for the place. CAP ROCK MINER went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, was well rated
while setting the pace, vied near the inside on the far turn, was set down under heavy threat in upper stretch, lost the advantage while swapping back to his
inside lead at the furlong marker and was outfinished while well clear for the show. OVERZEALOUS went two to three wide on the first turn, was pulled in by
the rider to encourage a lead change early on the backstretch, settled last but one, was roused while three then four wide on the far turn and lacked the
needed response. CITALI dropped well behind while three then two wide on the first turn, lagged at the rear, saved ground on the far turn and showed little.
FORESTDUNGONE went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, went four then five wide on the far
turn and faltered.

ROMAN JEWELS chased the pace down the backstretch, made a bid in the four path on the turn, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, was carried six
wide into the stretch then dropped in while moving clear, responded well in the final furlong and held under strong urging. ADINA was urged along on the
outside, chased in the five path on the turn then was driven six wide into the stretch, pursued the winner while inside of MAW MAW'S SOPHIA into the final
sixteenth and finished willingly to just get the place. MAW MAW'S SOPHIA was last to commence, raced on the outside while rated under a tight hold,
tucked into the four path early on the turn, moved to the five path while asked late on that bend, was driven seven wide into the stretch, chased the winner
on the outside while still on her inside lead and also finished willingly but just missed the place while well clear for the show. SMOOTHOUTTHETRACK
dropped back early then settled well off the pace, went around the turn in the three path, moved out outside the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten.
MADISON'S PLACE angled in behind the lugging out leader on the backstretch then was well placed along the rail, saved ground on the turn, was asked
inside the five-sixteenths then put to the whip into upper stretch and came up empty. BLUE RIDGE HEAT lugged out while setting the pace, vied in the three
path while being guided with extra left-rein pressure on the turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole, floated five wide into the stretch and tired. SANDY'S
WAGER was completely void of speed, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
GRIEF settled under some urging, saved ground on the turn then turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out inside the three-sixteenths, rallied into
the final furlong, drifted in while gaining in the final sixteenth and got up under good handling. RANCH BADGE pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the
three path on the turn, dropped back a bit late on that bend, came under the whip into the stretch, took the lead outside the furlong marker then shook clear,
remained clear into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. COFFEE COUNTY brushed with a rival after the start, chased the pace on
the inside of a rival, dropped back leaving the backstretch, started the turn in the two path, shifted four wide coming to the five-sixteenths, turned into upper
stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick while just able to get the show. JACKIE MOON set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied inside to
the two path on the turn, shook clear late on that bend, was set down in upper stretch, lost the advantage outside the furlong marker, dropped back into the
final sixteenth then had the rider lose his whip and weakened. GUILTY LOVER settled on the outside, was urged four to five wide on the turn, drifted out
inside the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. CATINANDSCATIN was taken in hand early, went four wide while let out on the turn, angled
out under a drive in upper stretch then was carried out further out and failed to threaten. MIGHTY ABLE was hustled from the start then urged along at the
rear, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. CHINESE BANDIT brushed with a rival after the start, settled
off the pace, was urged along while inside to the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under the whip and came up empty. JOEBOY was urged
along off the pace, dropped back three wide on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
GHOST GIANT settled on the inside, dropped back midway down the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, rallied into upper stretch, closed well
to get the lead approaching the furlong marker then drew clear under steady urging. SPACE MOUNTAIN broke in and bumped with a rival, went three wide
on the first turn, settled towards the back on the outside, was urged three wide on the far turn, swung seven wide while gaining into upper stretch, made a
bid outside the furlong marker and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. NEW EAGLE settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn,
gained in the two path into the stretch, chased into the final furlong and just missed the place while able to get the show. NOBLE EGYPTIAN went around
the first turn in the two path, was rated off the pace, moved closer in the two path on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, jostled with a foe around
the three-sixteenths, chased into the final furlong and weakened. LATE NITE MISCHIEF went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused
three then four wide on the far turn, gained six wide into the stretch, jostled with a foe around the three-sixteenths and came up empty. MAJESTIC SIGN
prompted the pace on the outside in the three path, took the lead outside the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into the stretch under a right-handed whip,
drifted out some under heavy pressure, lost the advantage approaching the furlong marker and gave way. JO'S BOLD CAT brushed with a rival at the start,
saved ground on the first turn, lagged at the rear, traveled around the far turn in the two path, came four wide into the stretch then moved further out and
was no factor. MERLIN'S SONG went to the front, set the pace on the inside with company to his outside, lost the advantage outside the five-sixteenths,
dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated. HONOVI bumped with a rival at the start, went two to three wide on the turns and failed to respond.

Footnotes
OUR STARLET chased the pace, went four wide on the turn, dropped in after turning into the stretch, took the lead before the three-sixteenths then kicked
clear and held under strong urging. CUSTOM FOR ALY was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch then shifted
further out outside the furlong marker and finished willingly for the place. G'S SQUEEZE chased the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch
in the two path, moved out around the three-sixteenths, chased the winner into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. MISS
LAUGHALOT was urged along off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, dropped in nearing the furlong
marker and lacked the needed response. EVE'S DELIGHT was urged along towards the rear on the outside, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into
the stretch then moved further out and failed to threaten. SHELLEYS A WARRIOR disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn,
lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and gave way. KIMMY broke very awkwardly and a bit slow, went around the turn in the two path and was no
factor. SARAH ADRIANA drifted out inside the five-eighths, went five wide on the turn and came up empty. JULIA'S CHANCE broke a bit slow, dropped well
behind the rest of the field, went three wide on the turn and showed little. FLAT OUT CRYPTO contested the pace on the outside, vied two to three wide on
the turn and faded.
