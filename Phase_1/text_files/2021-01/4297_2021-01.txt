three wide in the stretch, was gaining ground and just missed in the end. FOLD EM was settled then saved ground on the turn, was inside in the stretch and
finished well in the end. FREE FLYING FAST dueled for the lead while two wide, was in a long drive and weakened in late stretch. TEXAS TIDELANDS was
two wide on the turn then made a bid but was no menace in late stretch. TWILIGHT CURFEW was saving ground on the turn and failed to menace.

faltered. WYOME was unhurried early and failed to menace. VENUS ISLAND was inside on the turn and was no menace. EUROROSE was through early
