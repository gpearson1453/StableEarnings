Footnotes
PLAY UNIFIED disputed the pace on the inside of two foes, dropped back late on the backstretch, angled from the two to the four path on the turn, gained
to make an outside bid in upper stretch, dueled outside of the runner-up in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. STRONG BEAUTY
disputed the pace on the outside, vied two to three wide on the turn, responded well when set down into upper stretch, dueled inside of the winner in the
final furlong and just missed while clear for the place. YES GORGEOUS disputed the pace between horses then inside on the turn, dropped back under a
drive in upper stretch and weakened but was clear for the show. NEW YEAR'S PARTY settled on the inside of rivals, dropped back some late on the
backstretch, moved in at the seven-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn and lacked the needed response. FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS was void of speed,
dropped well behind under urging, went two then three wide on the turn, swung eight wide into the stretch then drifted further out around the
three-sixteenths and failed to threaten. AFLEET MOON settled on the outside, moved in midway down the backstretch, steadied into the turn, went around
that bend in the two path and came up empty. MIA O MAYA broke a step slow, settled between horses, dropped back some late on the backstretch,
dropped from three to two wide early on the turn and was no factor. JET SWEEP settled on the outside, was urged four to five wide on the turn then driven
six wide into the stretch and also failed to respond. BELLAMY CAY was urged along off the pace, came under lighter encouragement while behind a foe
around the half-mile pole, dropped back while moving out at the seven-sixteenths, was urged three wide on the turn then came four wide into the stretch and
capitulated. FANCY MALLORY was urged along towards the front on the outside, chased four then five wide on the turn and retreated.

the final furlong, moved out while gaining fast into the final sixteenth and blew by the leading duo without the use of the whip. JUST MIGHT disputed the
pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, battled outside of READYFORPRIMETIME under a drive into the final sixteenth, got the best
of that foe but was overtaken by the winner and earned the place. READYFORPRIMETIME disputed the pace on the inside of JUST MIGHT, vied inside to
the two path on the turn, battled under a drive with the aforementioned foe into the final sixteenth and was outfinished late then just missed the place. FAST
BOAT settled near the middle of the field, was urged in the three path while inside of a foe on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed kick. BORN GREAT was well placed behind the leading duo, dropped back some while inside on the turn, was roused three wide into the stretch
and lacked the needed response. REAL MONEY broke a half-step slow, settled while last but one, was urged along in the two path on the turn, swung six
wide into the stretch and failed to rally. ARCHIDUST broke a bit slow, settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn then driven five wide into the
stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
LIJANA was well placed just off the pace on the inside, came under some urging on the far turn, rallied inside to make a bid outside the furlong marker then
took the advantage, shook clear inside that marker and prevailed under steady urging. LOVE IN THE AIR became keen under restraint into the first turn,
rounded that bend in the two path, settled off the pace, moved closer with a half-mile to run, was roused while inside to the two path on the far turn, bumped
with a foe while coming out in upper stretch then made a bid between horses, lost touch with the winner inside the furlong marker, kept on well into the final
sixteenth, bumped again with the same foe late and earned the place. OFFICE PARTY was carried out into the first turn, went six then five wide on that
bend settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the far turn, bumped with LOVE IN THE AIR in upper stretch then made a bid on the outside, bumped
again with that foe late and was out-kicked but clearly earned the show. HANA ROAD went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside,
chased in the three path on the turn, made a bid into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. WALK ME HOME moved in while
going to the front, set the pace in the two path, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage outside the
furlong marker and tired. TRANSIENT (GB) saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the back, started the far turn in the two path, shifted three wide at
the five-sixteenths then four wide shortly thereafter, swung six wide into the stretch and improved position. GO BIG GREEN bumped with a rival early, went
around the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, rounded the far turn in the two path, was taken in hand off heels briefly just inside the
five-sixteenths, came under a drive into upper stretch and failed to rally. LET'S SKEDADDLE checked between horses nearing the wire for the first time,
went four to five wide on the turns, bumped hard with a rival at the five-sixteenths and failed to threaten. LAUGH IT OFF pulled hard under restraint while
keen into the first turn then was taken up, went four wide on that bend, dropped in early on the backstretch, was reserved near the middle of the field,
moved in to save ground on the far turn and came up empty. STRIKE OF HONOR went five then four wide on the first turn, settled well back on the outside,
went around the far turn in the two path and failed to respond. PINK CHANNEL broke in then hit the gate and was off a bit slow, went two to three wide on
the turns while at the back and was no factor. CINDYLOUWHO bumped with foes on both sides early then was taken up while squeezed back, tugged hard
at the bit under a tight hold while rank into the first turn, bumped with a foe at that point, went four to five wide on the turns and had nothing left.
REMINISCENT was bumped into the first turn, went five to six wide on the bends, lugged in some in upper stretch and never reached contention. SNEAKY
bumped with a foe early, was keen under restraint then lugged out into the first turn, went three to four wide on the bends, bumped hard with a foe at the
five-sixteenths and capitulated.

RIGHTANDJUST moved in while going to the front, set the pace while inside to the two path, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole then came
under a drive, drew off into the final furlong and proved much the best under strong urging. GAGETOWN raced inside to the two path on the first turn, was
rated just off the pace, started the far turn in the two path then was asked, shifted four wide at the five-sixteenths, chased the winner in the stretch and was
second best. COUSIN LARRY bumped with a rival at the start, raced inside on the first turn, was reserved towards the rear, saved ground under urging on
the far turn and lacked the needed response. BEEP BEEP bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, went four to five wide on the turns, turned into the
stretch under the whip and failed to rally. GHOSTLIGHTER went two to three wide on the turns and was no factor. ANGKOR bobbled at the start, moved out
into the first turn, went three wide on that bend, settled off the pace, was urged three wide on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch, was taken up
while out of contention at the furlong marker and capitulated. MANOR HOUSE bumped with a rival at the start, went three to four wide on the first turn,
settled just off the pace on the outside, chased four to five wide on the far turn and came up empty. STAYIN' OUT LATE broke awkwardly then bobbled on
the following stride, went around the first turn in the two path, lagged at the rear, moved from the inside to three wide on the far turn, came out into upper
stretch and was no factor. GOOD FIRST bumped with a rival at the start, went four to five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged four wide
on the far turn and failed to respond. A C EXPRESSWAY broke very awkwardly then bumped with a rival, went two to three wide on the first turn, stalked

LOGICAL MYTH was bumped in the hindquarters after the start, went around the first turn in the two path, was rated just off the pace, drafted inside on the
far turn, raced just off heels outside the quarter-pole then was asked while cutting the corner into the stretch, rallied to make a bid into the final furlong then
shook clear and proved best under strong urging. BIG AGENDA went to the front, set the pace on the inside, came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the
lead inside the furlong marker and was outfinished while just able to get the place. SPECTACULAR GEM bumped with a rival at the start, went four wide on
the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and was out-kicked then just
missed the place but earned the show. PEACE ACHIEVED bumped with a rival after the start, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace,
came under urging while inside to the two path on the far turn, was driven three wide into the stretch then moved out and lacked the needed kick. SAILING

settled towards the rear, went around the far turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. SPLIT THE WICKETS
bumped with a foe at the start and was off a step slow, quickly angled in at the rear, went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the back, saved
ground on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MY BOY JACK bumped with a foe after the start, saved ground on the first
turn, was reserved off the pace, went three wide while roused on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. MARAUD was taken in hand
early, went four wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, lugged out some leaving the backstretch, went five then four wide on the far turn, was

Footnotes
CHARLIE'S PENNY was bumped at the start and forced into another foe, went four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside under a tight hold,
was let out in the four path on the far turn, rallied to the lead in upper stretch then kicked clear and proved much the best under a brisk hand ride. SOUPER
SENSATIONAL was last to commence, came under a strong hold while crowded against the rail early, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved under
tight restraint, went around the far turn in the two then three path, swung five wide into the stretch and got up for the place. MOON SWAG broke out and hit
the gate then bumped with a rival, was taken up while rank off heels early on the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path, was rated just off the pace,
drafted in the two path on the far turn, was roused while three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. SUN PATH was
forced out at the start, went three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader in the three path on the far turn, took
the advantage at the quarter-pole but was headed at the three-sixteenths, drifted to the rail shortly thereafter, dropped back into the final furlong and
weakened. LITTLESTITIOUS broke out at the start, dropped to the rail early on the first turn, set the pace through tepid fractions, vied inside while asked on
the far turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole and gave way. BARISTA was bumped at the start and forced out, went five wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, was roused while three then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch then dropped in and failed to respond.

pressure while inside on the far turn, was roused for more at the quarter-pole, shook off two foes in upper stretch and held under strong urging. PROXY
bumped with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace down the backstretch, was asked at the seven-sixteenths, made a bid in
the two path under urging on the far turn, dropped behind the winner under a drive in upper stretch, drifted out while chasing near the sixteenth-pole and
finished with good courage to just get the place. MANDALOUN went four wide on the first turn, settled in third on the outside, was given his cue leaving the
backstretch, chased three wide on the far turn, pursued the winner on the outside of the runner-up in the stretch, was carried out near the sixteenth-pole,
kept on to the wire and just missed the place while well clear for the show. SANTA CRUISER bumped with a rival at the start then was shut-off, went two to
three wide on the turns while at the rear, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ARABIAN PRINCE broke a step slow, settled on the inside,
was roused near the seven-sixteenths, dropped back under urging while inside for most of the far turn then moved to the two path and came up empty.
GAME DAY PLAY broke out at the start, went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, angled in while dropping back leaving the backstretch, went
around the far turn in the two path then came three wide into the stretch and capitulated. REGULAR GUY bumped with a rival at the start, was keen under
restraint in the three path on the first turn then reserved off the pace, went three then four wide under urging on the far turn and failed to respond. RED N
