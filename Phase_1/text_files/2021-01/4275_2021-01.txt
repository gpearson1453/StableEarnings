Footnotes
RAULITO saved ground unhurried to the far turn, came off the rail beginning to find stride at the top of the stretch, split ANDRES EDUARDO and PUGIN
past the eighth-pole and bested the latter through a late duel. PUGIN moved in from the four-path entering the first turn, came back out three wide rallying
into the stretch, battled outside RAULITO through the last sixteenth of a mile and was edged to the wire. CITY MAGIC moved off the inside to the three-path
past the quarter-pole, and rallied with good energy. ANDRES EDUARDO stayed in range early, bid three wide reaching a short lead outside in upper
stretch, then weakened through the last sixteenth of a mile. SETTE STELLE bumped lightly with SWEENEY'S CAT at the start, lagged at the back to the far
turn, and improved late without threatening. SWEENEY'S CAT bumped lightly with SETTE STELLE at the start, prompted the pace outside UNCAPTURED
PULSE, brushed with that one while challenging for command at the top of the stretch, and weakened past the furlong marker. THE ZIP FACTOR raced
three wide early, and faded after a half-mile. CAN'T BE BROKEN moved in from the five-path entering the first turn, continued inward winding up on the rail
turning for home, and could not gain. UNCAPTURED PULSE hustled to the front inside after the start, cut an even pace, brushed with SWEENEY'S CAT at
the top of the stretch, and gave way into the final furlong. CITY MAGIC raced under the name of DALLAS HICCUP and has been renamed.

Footnotes
GRACE'S DRAMA lied forwardly placed along the inside bid for the lead turning for home two wide and between horses, surged between those foes in
midstretch, and drove clear through the final furlong. BACCARAT FASHION lied well off of the pace through the opening furlong, but resisted restraint and
pulled forward leaving the chute, cleared the field passing the five furlong marker, maintained a clear margin around the turn while pursuing foes inched
closer, turned for home meeting a trio of bids, dug in in upper stretch, but was headed by the eventual winner passing the furlong pole, then held place on
his left lead. SASSY JUSTICE lied forwardly placed three wide, bid for the lead four wide turning for home, but was outkicked by an inner bidding rival in
upper stretch, and flattened out. ASSUME CONTROL lied off of the pace early on, swung five wide turning for home, and improved for a minor share.
PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL vied along the inside early on, allowed BACCARAT FASHION to clear off passing the five furlong marker, stalked that foe from
between horses around the turn, but steadied in tight quarters while attempting a bid between those foes at the three sixteenths pole, then altered course
outwards in upper stretch, but failed to rebid. GRAN ETIQUETA trailed along the inside, and made a mild late gain but failed to menace. DIXIE PRINCESS
was done early, and eased through the lane.

JADE EMPRESS bumped with SCHAKOLAD at the start, pursued the leaders from between horses early, saved ground patiently handled around the turn,
came out to challenge NO DECAF from outside at the top of the stretch, and bested that rival through the last eighth of a mile. NO DECAF set the pace in
the two-path to the stretch, moved inside coming under attack from JADE EMPRESS, and could not withstand that one while clearly best of the others.
SKYFLY advanced to loom a threat outside NO DECAF after a half-mile, but could not sustain the bid and ran on one-paced through the lane. KHOSEA
bumped with ONE NIGHT STAND at the start, came under a ride midway on the turn, and posed no threat. SCHAKOLAD bumped with JADE EMPRESS at
the start, pressed the early pace inside, moved out three wide approaching the stretch and faded. ONE NIGHT STAND bumped with KHOSEA at the start,
and was always outrun.

Footnotes
MOROCCO saved ground from midpack, shifted out around the far turn to split foes four wide turning for home, produced a bid for the lead in upper stretch,
drew clear passing the furlong grounds, and drifted out through the late stages while maintaining a clear advantage. NOBLE INDY vied inside of ABIDING
STAR into the first turn, took back to stalk from the pocket into the backstretch, held ground saving position turning for home as outer foes made bids,
awaited racing room behind traffic through upper stretch as MOROCCO got the jump, switched out to a clear path passing the furlong pole, and stayed on
while hanging on his left lead to secure place without reaching the drifting leader. STIRLING DRIVE lied far off of the pace along the inside, shifted three
wide into the far turn to commence a rally, got floated five wide turning for home by the eventual winner while getting outkicked by that foe, then stayed on
through the final furlong, but was denied achieving place by an inner foe. FIG JELLY stalked three wide around the first turn, inched closer to the leader into
the far turn to vie for the lead two wide around that bend, forged an advantage turning for home, but was headed by the eventual winner approaching the
furlong pole, and weakened late. FINANCIAL SYSTEM lied off of the pace two to three wide around the first turn, advanced under his own power to stalk the
pace three wide around the far turn, but was outkicked by an outer foe passing the three sixteenths pole, and tired thereafter. BLUERIDGE TRAVELER
trailed along the inside, saved ground around both turns before shifting to the five path through upper stretch, and improved position without threatening.
ABIDING STAR set the pace outside of NOBLE INDY into the first turn, cleared that foe around that bend, then vied inside of FIG JELLY around the far turn
after that foe made a bid, but was headed by that rival passing the quarter pole, and gave way in upper stretch. THE LAST ZIP tracked from midpack two
wide, but was done into the far turn.

Footnotes
COREY stalked two wide early on, shifted three wide at the three furlong pole to perch himself outside of the leading pair, inched closer turning for home to
produce a three wide bid for the lead passing the three sixteenths pole, then edged past the leader with a sixteenth to go to win under a long drive.
FOOLISH HEART was reluctant to load, but broke sharply and quickly cleared to the inside, set the pace while feeling pressure from BATTLE CRY around
the turn, dug in to repel that foe in upper stretch as COREY produced a menacing bid, but was edged out by that foe passing the sixteenth pole. BATTLE
CRY stalked three wide early on, advanced to prompt the pace two wide into the turn, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, but was repelled by his
inner counterpart in upper stretch as COREY edged up alongside, then chased those foes home. DEM A WONDER stalked along the inside, but failed to
produce a bid while sustaining his chase through the lane. STATE CROWN brushed the gate at the start and was off a step slowly, trailed the field in the
two path around the turn, then stayed on without threatening. ROMANTICAL NOTE saved ground while off of the pace, but was outrun.

Footnotes
ZAP DADDY tucked in covered up behind the leaders to the top of the stretch, found a seam between horses past the eighth-pole, collared DR. SHANE
from outside and edged away under good handling. DR. SHANE prompted the pace outside TENACITY ZIP, poked a head in front with a quarter-mile
remaining, fought gamely through the stretch and held on well. J P HELLISH steadied slightly approaching the first turn, stayed in range two then three wide
to the top of the stretch, rallied between horses but did not have enough. BOW TIE AFFAIR trailed early inside, took closer order around the far turn three
then four wide, and improved on the far outside for the last major share. PAGLIACCI saved ground to the far turn, moved to the two-path and found himself
behind horses through the furlong grounds, then lacked a closing bid when clear. HIGH HEATER raced three wide in easy striking range, had a clear shot
turning for home but was outfinished. TENACITY ZIP moved inside clearing to the lead around the first turn, got overhauled near the quarter-pole, stayed on
to mid stretch and gave way. DEXTER ROAD was three wide early, moved inside before reaching the far turn, and made no headway. JUST THE FACTS
was in tight between horses entering the first turn, advanced after a half-mile, moved out four then five wide around the far turn, and had nothing left for the
drive.

Footnotes
SHOOTIN THE BREEZE lied forwardly placed two wide, inched closer three wide around the far turn to produce a bid for the lead outside of the loose
leader turning for home, dueled with that foe through the lane, and prevailed late. MAJESTIC RO set the pace along the inside, maintained a loose lead into
the far turn, met SHOOTIN THE BREEZE's bid turning for home, dug in and dueled gamely to resist that foe through upper stretch, but was bested inside
the final sixteenth. PLEASECALLMEBACK lied far off of the pace two wide around the first turn, advanced to track from midpack three wide and between
horses around the far turn, then sustained a rally as the leaders kicked clear in upper stretch, and chased them home evenly through the late stages.
INDIAN COUNSELOR lied far off of the pace three wide around the first turn, advanced along with PLEASECALLMEBACK to track while four deep in
midpack around the far turn, then stayed on mildly to claim a minor share. MONY stalked three to two wide around the first turn, held stalking position into
the far turn, but weakened between horses turning for home. AHNAF stalked along the inside early on, but faded around the far turn and was done early.
ALEJANDRO'S TEAM saved ground off of the pace, but failed to shift off of the inside in upper stretch despite a mild rider steering attempt, and faded.

Footnotes
SUPERFECTO volleyed for command outside ASHAAR early, gained the upper hand midway on the turn, shook off a bid from SUMMER KID at the top of
the stretch and drew off under steady pressure. ASHAAR vied inside SUPERFECTO for five furlongs, got overtaken for second on the turn, then stayed on
with good courage on his left lead to regain that spot. TARGET TALES raced two wide around the turn, and lacked a solid response. LOOKIN AT ROSES
brushed with DON BOURBON at the start, moved off the inside to the three-path around the turn, and failed to menace. SUMMER KID tracked outside the
leaders to the turn, loomed outside SUPERFECTO with a quarter-mile remaining, but gave way once straightened away for the drive. SOUNION stayed
close for a half-mile, and faded around the turn inside. DON BOURBON brushed with LOOKIN AT ROSES at the start, moved out up the backstretch, and
was through early.

Footnotes
CASH CALL KITTEN rated at the rear of the pack two wide, swung six wide turning for home, rallied outside of foes through the lane to produce a bid
approaching the wire, and just got up. FARLEY hopped a bit at the start, rated off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the two path and awaited racing
room around the far turn, swung five wide turning for home, rallied inside of CASH CALL KITTEN through the lane to produce a late bid approaching the
wire, but was outfinished by his outer counterpart, and dead-heated for place. LAHINCH lied off of the pace two wide, rallied four wide and outside of horses
around the far turn to bid for the lead in upper stretch, drove past inner foes passing the furlong marker, but met a pair of bids approaching the wire, got
nailed, and dead-heated for place. DIDNT DO IT established a loose lead around the first turn, held that advantage turning for home from a trio rivals, but
was headed passing the furlong pole, and gave way. COWBOY'S HERO saved ground from midpack early on, advanced to a three wide stalking position
into the far turn, produced a three wide bid for the lead in upper stretch, then got outkicked by outer foes. PLAYING HOOKY saved ground at the rear of the
field, but to no avail. REMEMBER THE MAINE saved ground while stalking the pace, failed to surge through a non-existent opening in upper stretch,
steadied, then was buried inside of rivals thereafter. HONOLULU EXPRESS stalked two wide, produced a mild bid between horses in upper stretch as outer
rivals ranged up alongside, but weakened in midstretch.
