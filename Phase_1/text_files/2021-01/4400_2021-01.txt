Footnotes
LUCKY OLIVIA ROSE vied two wide for command, dueled with WINGS OF FURY throughout, took over from that rival nearing the quarter pole and drew
clear under urging. ANGEL RAPHAEL raced off the pace inside, chased entering the far turn, rallied three wide into the stretch and dug in gamely late to
earn the place spot. WINGS OF FURY vied inside for the lead, dueled with the winner, dug in gamely in upper stretch and lost second late. PAOLLA'S
HEART raced two wide off the pace, advanced between rivals on the far turn, steadied slightly at the five sixteenths marker, then gained mildly outside.
ENOUGH LOVE raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far turn and gained mildly on the rail. FREE COFFEE raced four wide early, then stalked
three wide, chased on the far turn and gave way. SAVANNAH'S DREAM stumbled, was off slowly and steadied, then outrun. A Jockey Objection by the
rider of PAOLLA'S HEART against ANGEL RAPHAEL was dismissed.

BAD SUENO settled outside the dueling leaders, led at the quarter pole, resisted challenges and held on gamely to earn the nod. SPARTAK saved ground
throughout, loomed a threat in mid stretch but could not get by. REFI broke sluggishly, made a menacing wide middle move on the final turn but weakened
in the stretch. VIOLENT IMPACT forced the pace outside for five furlongs and gave way. COMMISSIONER DAVE lagged well behind inside and never a
factor. BRIDLECREST earned a narrow advantage inside then stopped into the far turn.

Footnotes
ARCH CAT settled just off the pacesetter, took over into the stretch and drew away eagerly under moderate urging. GRIT'N'GRIND dropped well behind,
advanced inside on the turn, closed well to get up for the place. FIX ME A SANDWICH quickly took control inside, widened briefly, was collared on the turn
then proved empty late. APPEALING FUTURE was urged close up three wide then flattened out in the stretch. AWE MUN saved ground off the pace and
lacked a rally. GET THE W broke alertly, raced close up wide for a quarter mile and gave way. HAPPYASCANB dropped back early under a patient hold
and was always outrun.

Footnotes
KNOCKOUT KICK stumbled at the start while breaking on top, showed good early speed, dueled inside between calls, shook free, kicked clear and held on
well under urging. DIG CHARLIE DIG raced three wide off the pace, went five wide past the quarter pole, rallied outside, closed willingly in the final furlong
and was along for the place spot. ARK IN THE DARK raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the turn, came two wide into the lane, rallied near the
rail and got up for third. LA WAUN chased close up outside the winner, made a bid, dueled briefly with that rival, then chased and weakened. CALL ME
DADDY chased three wide, raced three wide on the turn and finished evenly. EMPEROR JOHN raced two wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane
and gained mildly outside. THOUSAND PERCENT chased inside and lacked a rally. BLACK LIGHT chased two wide, between rivals on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
I'M BUSY saved ground, angled out in the stretch, bid to the front passing the eighth pole and gamely held inside rival safe. ROYAL URN steadied along
lacking room inside on the turn, split foes in the stretch but was outdueled late. MOUNT TRAVERS raced close up off the inside and continued willingly to
the finish. POPIZAR dropped back very wide and finished well while no threat. SPIRIT SPECIAL trailed early, moved extremely wide on the turn then
offered some late energy. FINAL SHOT pressed the pace outside, faded on the turn but continued well. DANCING BULL quickly led inside, widened on the
turn but proved empty in the final furlong. WAR TOCSIN was urged close up three wide to the stretch and faltered. WENTZ raced wide within striking range
then gave way. PNUTBUTTER SPECIAL broke sluggishly and raced far back throughout.
