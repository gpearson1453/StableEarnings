Footnotes
STAR GAZE was forwardly place from the inside then made a bid on the backstretch and gained command at the three quarter pole to draw clear while
driving. NANA'S JOY was allowed to settle on the inside and rallied from the outside to have her best strides late. MISS OCEAN EXPRESS stalked the
pace from the three path made a bid on the turn but had no response late. HONEST WOMAN was unhurried early from the two path then steadily advanced
from the outside and came up empty in the drive. MEMORY MAGIC set the early pace from the inside and gave way. ANGEL CAT was not a factor.
CUSTOMS IN DIXIE was away alertly but broke to the outside then pressed the pace from the three path and was through after a half.

Footnotes
FORT PIKE led throughout from the two path and just lasted. JULIO CHOICE was forwardly placed in the two path and made a late rally to just miss.
TENSAS SUNDAY was well placed in the four path then drifted in on the backstretch and made a rail bid mid stretch to be up for the show. BACK INTHAT
ACTION broke to the outside and forced foe out then stalked the pace from the three path and weakened late. APRIORITY GIRL was force out wide at the
break but rushed to contention to press the pace and tired. FORTHELOVEOFLUCY was unhurried early and improved position. CAROLS CUPCAKE failed
to menace. TAKENFORGRANTED was not a factor. SKY SUM pressed the pace from the inside then was in tight on the turn and checked to give way.
AUDACIOUS GIRL stalked the pace from the four path then was in tight mid backstretch and was steadied, fell and walked off. A STEWARD INQUIRY
WAS CALLED ON #7 TENSAS SUNDAY AFTER REVIEW THE INQUIRY WAS DISALLOWED.

LANGS DAY trailed the field early then made a late rally from the outside to be up in final strides. CHARLIES TICKET stalked the pace from the inside then
angled out stretch to have his best strides late. TOP DRAW raced in the middle of the pack then moved between horses in the stretch to hold show. FRANK
THE MAYOR was allowed to settle then steadily advanced from the three path made a mild bid on the turn and faded in the drive. BOLD THIRST was
unhurried early and improved positon. DYNAMO KID led until the eight pole and gave way. FLATOUT WINNER failed to menace. LIKEN IT was forwardly
placed in the two path and tired. ARCTIC ROSE stalked the pace from the four path and was through after a half.

Footnotes
MUFFIN NUTS was unhurried early from the two path then angled out final turn to make a late rally while driving. DODGER was forwardly placed and
dueled from the two path made a bid to gain lead briefly in the final turn and held sway. KINLEE'S SONG was off slow then allowed to settle inside and
steadily advanced made a bid on the final turn and hung. SMOOTH CURRENT was wide into the first turn then chased leaders from the two path made a
bid on final turn but came up empty. ANDIAMO GIACOMO improved position. BLACK SWORD led for a half and tired. SABER RUN stalked the pace and
dueled from the two path then gave way late. CALLINGINTHENIGHT was not a factor. MISS JENNY'S HALO was through early.
