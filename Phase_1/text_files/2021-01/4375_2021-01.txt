Footnotes
D'WILD BARONESS disputed the pace on the outside of a foe, vied in the two path on the turn, kicked clear under a strong hand ride in upper stretch, was
put to a left-handed whip inside the furlong marker, drew off under the whip into the final sixteenth then was placed under a hand ride to the wire while much
the best. LAGNIAPPE showed good speed, contested the pace on the inside of the winner while along the rail, lost touch with that foe while under the whip
in upper stretch and proved no match while able to hold the place. GOODNIGHT GRACIE dropped back at the start, angled in towards the rear of the field
then was rated while tugging at the bit, saved ground just behind the leaders while guided around the turn with extra left rein pressure, spun into the two
path entering the stretch then was asked after straightening for the drive and narrowly earned the show. BLONDIE LOX BABE broke in at the start, settled
on the far outside, dropped back late on the backstretch, went four then five wide on the turn, was roused into the stretch, drifted in near the furlong marker
and just missed the show. LIL' SISTER LOU broke in and bumped with a foe, tracked the leading duo on the outside then three wide on the turn, was asked
near the quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. BROOKLYN BABY was bumped at the start and forced in, raced off
the pace while rated under tight restraint, drafted two to three wide on the turn, was asked while shifting four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. FLAT SCAT broke in then was taken up off heels, angled in at the rear oft he field, went three wide early on the turn, shifted six wide around the
five-sixteenths, drifted out in upper stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
BREONNA dropped from the three path to the rail while in front on the first turn, tracked the pace down the backstretch, was asked in the two path on the far
turn, came three wide into the stretch, made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, battled with the runner-up in the final furlong and prevailed under strong
urging. MS SATCH MO was taken under a tight hold early, went four then three wide on the first turn, moved to the clear lead entering the backstretch, went
around the far turn in the two path, was asked outside the three-sixteenths then battled inside of the winner, drifted out inside the furlong marker and missed
while able to get the place. TAPTIME went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved at the rear, rounded the far turn in the two path, was put to a
drive in upper stretch, angled out just as the leader started to drift out inside the furlong marker, altered to the outside of the leading duo and finished with
good energy but was too late while clear for the show. PERKS D'ORO went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while three
wide on the far turn, floated five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. PEACE NICKER bumped with a rival at the start, went three wide on
the first turn, was reserved on the outside, came under urging in the three path on the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch then dropped in and
failed to rally. MISS UNIONIST was forced in at the start, went two to three wide on the turns and was no factor. TAYLOR'S WISH broke in and hit the gate,
rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the back on the outside, was asked along the rail on the far turn and failed to respond. FANCY GI GI saved
ground on the first turn, dropped back significantly entering the backstretch, settled near the back, saved ground on the far turn, came out into the stretch
and faltered.

well to get the lead into the final sixteenth and prevailed under vigorous handling. AMERICAN REBEL settled towards the rear, went three wide on the turn,
moved out under a drive in upper stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed well but missed while just able to get the place. OUR MARDI GRAS
broke out and a half-step slow, tracked the pace on the outside, made a four wide bid on the turn, took the lead into the stretch, led under a drive to the
sixteenth-pole then was collared by the winner, kept on to the wire and lost the place while just able to get the show. SPELLBINDING settled in a good
position off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, was roused at the quarter-pole, gained to make a bid into the final furlong, battled with multiple foes
to the wire and just missed the trifecta. BIRDCATMOUSE pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under
a drive and tired. STEAL THE STARS set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead into the stretch and gave way.
