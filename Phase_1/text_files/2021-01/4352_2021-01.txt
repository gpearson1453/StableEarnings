GOOD MEASURE saved ground on the turn, eased out to the two path entering the stretch, rallied inside horses, led late and narrowly prevailed. LUMINIST
lacked speed, was three wide turning for home and rallied between horses. MOONSAFE disputed the pace two wide, opened a clear advantage turning for
home, drifted out in upper stretch and tired. NICOLAR stalked the pace, moved up three deep leaving the turn, took aim on the leader in upper stretch and
gave way in the drive. EXPECT THE SUNRISE hugged the inner rail, dueled to the stretch and faltered.

VICS COOL CAT vied between rivals early on, moved clear after a quarter mile then set a rated pace, responded when set down two wide in upper stretch,
widened a bit past the eighth pole then held firm while kept to task. HYDRA had speed three deep, tracked the winner around the turn, gave hard chase
from upper stretch and continued with good energy to save the place. UNION SONG steadied when in a bit close at the break, recovered and settled inside,
angled four to five wide advancing into the lane, straightened away and closed steadily. SUZYSELLSSEASHELLS , rank in the opening three sixteenths,
settled in the clear nearing the turn, angled four wide under coaxing into the stretch but went evenly in the final furlong. UNO TIGRESS had speed to contest
the early pace inside the top pair, eased back a bit after a quarter mile and stalked, had aim along the rail in upper stretch, failed to kick on leaving the
eighth pole and faded. HAD THE NOTION lacked speed while off the inside, was under urging leaving the far turn, angled five wide but came up empty.

a half furlong pole and dropped to last, came back out and was put to pressure past the five sixteenths, entered the lane four to five wide, closed
determinedly under left handed rousing, struck the top soon past the sixteenth marker, kicked clear and was taken in hand the final strides. GRACETOWN ,
three wide to the lead early on, dropped in when clearing past the six furlong pole, was well rated up front, spurted away under coaxing near the five
sixteenths, was put to firmer asking soon into the lane, dug in when confronted past the three sixteenths, fought on gamely and held down the place.
PERSISTO , taken in hand outside rivals, ranged up past the five sixteenths, bid outside the leader in upper stretch, vied past the furlong grounds but hung
a bit late. PAT'S NO FOOL , under a firm hold past the three quarter pole, moved up four wide leaving the three eighths, drifted in when chasing past the
three sixteenths then went evenly late. STAY SMART , urged from the gate and disputed the early pace towards the rail, rated off the leader past the six
furlong marker and stalked, dropped back some under asking leaving the five sixteenths, eased out a bit in the drive and found some more action in the final

Footnotes
POINT DRIVEN circled the turn four deep, swept to command in upper stretch then steadily drew out under a hand ride. PAY THE KID , three wide on the
turn, swung to the four path entering the stretch then chased the winner through the stretch in a willing effort. CATCH YA LATER BRO raced in the two path
on the turn, was steadied in close quarters in mid stretch, split horses inside the eighth pole and rallied. GLORIOUS WEEKEND , between horses on the
turn, was taken to the five path in mid stretch, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. CLASSY SOLUTION showed speed along the inner rail and
weakened. MEGA MILLIONS showed speed in the two path and weakened. ONE MORE NIGHTCAP raced in the three path on the turn and was not a
factor. ISABELLA'S MAGIC sprinted clear on the turn and gave way in upper stretch. TWO DOORS DOWN raced inside horses and was steadied lacking
room mid way on the turn.

Footnotes
CHARGING LION , between rivals early, advanced three wide into the lane, leveled off under right handed rousing leaving the three sixteenths, took over
inside the furlong grounds, kicked clear past the sixteenth pole then dug in gamely to hold sway. ALWAYS FORGIVEN settled well back while saving
ground, picked up some steam leaving the far turn, angled out soon after, circled four wide into the stretch, closed steadily and was getting to the winner.
SMART TWO A T opened up a long lead early on, set the pace two wide into the stretch, saw his lead dwindle leaving the three sixteenths, held on past mid
stretch then succumbed. EARNED IT lost ground four to five wide, was hustled along leaving the far turn but lacked a solid response. EMPTY NESTR
chased in the two path, raced willingly to about the furlong grounds then faded. HE'S ZIPPIN ON BY had his rider lose the right iron when breaking poorly,
rushed up towards the rail then steadied off heels, recovered past the seven eighths, got through along the rail to chase, stayed in range to the head of the
stretch then tired. KING MAURO , wide, appeared to want to get out around the final turn and retreated.

LOOKIN DYNAMIC , four deep entering the turn, moved up three wide leaving the bend, took the lead outside SKI BUNNY near the sixteenth pole then
drove clear. SKI BUNNY , three deep entering the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, opened up a clear advantage near the eighth pole then tired.
GENNIE HIGHWAY , briefly steadied lacking room along the inner rail near the half mile pole, remained inside horses to mid stretch, drifted out and lacked
the necessary late response. SAVEDBYTHEBELLE saved ground on the turn, eased out to the two path and rallied mildly between rivals. AWESOME PAL ,
taken to the inner rail after sprinting to the early lead, remained along the rail and weakened the final furlong. YESTERDAYSPLAN lacked speed, swung to
the five path entering the stretch and failed to rally. FAIRY WISH , outrun, was fanned to the six path turning for home. MAE SAI PRINCESS , fractious in
the starting gate, chased the pace in the two path and gave way leving the turn.

Footnotes
STEP BY STEP had speed to the inside of SEVILLA SANGRIA, rated back off that one and other rivals nearing the turn, sat patiently awaiting room off the
embattled leaders past the five sixteenths, found room along the rail to advance past the furlong grounds, kept on grinding under left handed
encouragement and just got up. SCARLET TANAGER stalked outside rivals early on, bid four deep leaving the far turn, dueled five wide outside runners
into the lane, moved to command near mid stretch, kept on gamely but just failed to contain the winner. SCAMPER ALONG , brushed at the break, raced
between horses leaving the far turn, chased three wide into the lane, angled out some with a sixteenth to go and closed between runners. COUGAR VISION
, in range four wide, circled five wide making progress into the stretch, shifted out from behind SCARLET TANAGER nearing mid stretch and closed. EIGHT
OAKS saved ground, moved up into the lane, was briefly stalled near mid stretch, eased out for room and rallied. ADABEL battled two to three wide
between runners, stayed on to about the sixteenth marker then faded. A TOAST TO KAY , three to four wide, challenged between horses leaving the far
turn, dueled to upper stretch and was still giving effort to the end. SEVILLA SANGRIA had speed to take command about two wide, took heavy pressure
from her outside, kept up the fight past mid stretch then faded. BIGDADDYSGLORY , off the pace while saving ground, swung very wide for the drive but
failed to generate a legitimate kick. MAJORIE MUGS drafted back off the early pace and failed to respond.

Footnotes
SPANISH D'ORO chased the pace around the turn, gained the lead outside the pace setter in mid stretch and drove clear. GOLDIE'S BOY set a pressured
pace along the rail and was out finished by the winner. LUXERO , briefly steadied in traffic leaving the backstretch, swung to the five path at the head of the
stretch and rallied outside foes. CANHERUN , four deep around the turn, offered a mild advance to the eighth pole then flattened out. UNCLE CECIL , three
wide chasing the pace around the turn, weakened in the drive. DOUBLBARRELBOURBON lacked speed and was not a factor. TINY TIN , wide turning for
home, showed mild, late interest. MAGIC OF LOVE hugged the inner rail, chased the pace, gave way and was eased. BALTINGLASS chased the early
pace while between horses and gave way on the turn. ZOINKS SCOOBY raced along the inner rail and was not a factor.
