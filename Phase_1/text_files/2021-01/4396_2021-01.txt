Footnotes
AVABELL went to the front, drove clear, pulled away and proved much the best. MISS DARLENE challenged for the early advantage, forwardly placed
throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. CANDY'S PARADE raced in the middle of the pack, saved ground around the turn,
showed late interest, but was no match for the top two. ANOTHERINTHEFIRE void of early speed, made a steady gain, racing inside, but was no threat.
FALYN'S GOLD RULER raced within contention, came around the turn on the outside and weakened. CHIEF FALCON lacked early speed, never mounted
a bid and showed little. DOWNEASTER ALEXA hesitated at the start, raced in the rear and was never a threat. POSEIDON'S QUEEN broke out, pressed
the pace and dropped back.

CHARLIE ROADS sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout, pulled away and proved much the best. SWANEE BEACH raced within contention,
forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. MY GIRL EM raced in the back of the pack, raced five wide around
the final turn, made a late gain and got up for the show. FEARLESS DIXIE raced in the middle of the field in the beginning, eased back, showed late
interest, but was no factor. KORAT QUEEN raced within striking distance, came around the final turn wide and finished evenly. CABEZA DE TORTUGA
pressed the early pace and was finished early. WE CAN DREAM raced near the back at the start, came around the first turn wide, moved up down the
backside to challenge the leader and faded around the final turn. LUMBERJACK EMPIRE void of early speed and was never close.
