early, rallied into the lane and moved up late. FLIGHT TIME (BRZ) good speed to vie on the lead to deep stretch but weakened late. STARSHIP MERCURY
raced evenly outside with no late gain in the final furlong. LIMEHOUSEGAS close up inside to the stretch and faltered in the drive. WING AND WHEEL
never menaced. PEPPERMINT ZIP raced evenly lacking a late response in the stretch run. SUM OVERTURE never menaced. ROLLIN MY OWN never
close. POLO ART had a sluggish start and never in the hunt.
