Footnotes
LOGSDON, bumped at the start, recovered to gain a position tracking off the first flight inside foes racing to the turn, continued under patient handling on the
bend, shifted out advancing in close quarters to bid three wide between foes entering upper stretch and wrested the advantage late under firm
encouragement. STUNNING BABY, urged between foes prompting the pace in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival to upper stretch, edged
forward leaving the furlong marker but couldn't fend off the winner. HAY HAY MY MY, urged to a forward placing four wide tracking just off the leaders into
the turn, continued willingly in that path entering the stretch to close the gap on the top pair late. PAPA RALPH J, in touch with the leaders three wide
between foes racing into the turn, was caught in tight quarters racing into upper stretch, then angled inside the leaders in the last furlong while continuing
with some interest. HE HAD A SECRET broke outwards bumping the eventual winner at the start, was quickly collected, then urged inside a rival disputing
the pace through the backstretch into the turn and gave out leaving the furlong marker. IGOTSUNSHINE tracked off the leaders five wide in early stages,
angled to the rail racing into the turn to make some brief progress inside foes but offered no closing bid.

Footnotes
GLORY ROLL broke readily, was urged to gain a clear advantage along the inside racing into the turn, then held sway under steady pressure to maintain a
comfortable margin proving best. HEATHER HILLS settled off the second flight in the opening stages, angled inwards nearing the turn, gathered momentum
splitting rivals three deep nearing upper stretch and continued in that path to late stages to prove best of the others. MARCHING IN, off a step slowly,
recovered to track off the leaders near the inside racing into the turn, shifted out nearing upper stretch but had no final kick. GIPSEY SORCERESS tracked
off the first flight five wide in early stages, then continued evenly four wide into the lane. BERBERSLILBRIEBRIE was settled last, angled to the rail on the
turn, saved ground to the lane to gain some position but proved no real threat. PAPA'S ISLA DOLL made brief pursuit of the eventual winner racing to the
turn and gave way into upper stretch. PASZ THE PEPPER tracked off the first flight between foes in the four path on the backstretch but retreated early.

challenge for command nearing upper stretch and drove clear. ABUELO NUNO broke in the air, then was bumped at the start, recovered to track off the
second flight between foes, angled four wide on the far turn and continued with interest outside a rival to prevail for the place honors late. LEND AMERICA
broke outwards bumping NEFARIOUS FELLA, was righted to track off the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, was urged to
bid between foes, then inside the eventual winner racing into upper stretch but weakened late. NEFARIOUS FELLA, bumped, then forced into ABUELO
NUNO at the start, was righted to track just off the second flight between foes, angled inwards racing into the far turn and faded in the drive while finishing in

SUCCESSFUL LEGACY tracked the pacesetter from out of striking distance under light rating to the backstretch, commenced a steady advance on the far
turn to gain the advantage racing into upper stretch and went well clear under pressure. BEAUTIFUL TIZ, bumped at the start, settled last to the
backstretch, swung out five wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to prevail for the place honors. ALEX'S FIRST hopped at
the start, was settled off the second flight to the backstretch, steadily advanced four wide on the far turn to upper stretch but was outkicked for second.
ATLANTIC PRINCESS worked her way to the inside tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, then continued between foes into the lane but offered
no closing bid. DONYA'S MAGIC sprinted well clear of the field racing to the backstretch while under light reserve, set the pace into the far turn but gave
way once headed by the winner. PRINCESS NINA broke in the air, was righted to track the leaders between foes in second flight, advanced three wide on
the far turn to lodge a brief bid nearing upper stretch but soon flattened out. RUBY LEE broke inwards bumping BEAUTIFUL TIZ, was righted to track the
leaders inside foes in the second flight but faded between rivals nearing the lane.

advance, dictated the pace in the two path into the far turn and held sway to the end under firm right handed pressure. CAPTIVANT tracked the leaders
between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted five wide racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance, continued to make steady
progress four wide into upper stretch to briefly loom outside the winner but proved only second best. BIG BASE tracked the leaders outside rivals in the
second flight in the opening half, shifted four wide steadily gaining position racing into the far turn, shifted inwards under pressure racing into upper stretch
and faded in the drive while edging a rival for a share. FUN PADDY tracked off the first flight inside foes racing to the backstretch, came around a tiring foe
to advance along the rail nearing upper stretch but flattened out leaving midstretch. DARLINDIVA, urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow
margin to the backstretch, gave way racing into the far turn. DILLY DOES IT settled inside a rival off the second flight early failed to menace. LEDECKY
dropped out early. QUEEN ROLLER, forwardly placed between foes prompting the pace, conceded some position while shifting out three wide midway

outside that foe to the backstretch, then dueled inside the eventual winner into upper stretch but gave out late. PATSY'S BIG GIRL was rated inside a rival
as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, was shuffled back behind a tiring foe racing into the far turn, was urged to split foes just off the inside
but couldn't regain contention. ESTILO DE MUJER, caught in tight quarters racing through the chute, then shuffled back, settled between foes racing t the

Footnotes
R BOY BODE, urged between from the outset disputing the pace, continued in a protracted duel past midstretch but narrowly prevailed under firm left
handed pressure. RAOFTHESUN tracked off the first flight four wide between foes racing into the turn and made a steady gain in that path late to edge
rivals for the place honors. EXECUTIVE DECREE angled inwards in the opening stages to prompt the pace three deep, pressed the issue past midstretch
but was outfinished. MINES MADE UP ducked out bumping PASSIONATE HACHI at the start, switched outside foes tracking off the second flight, was
prompted to advance five wide through the turn to upper stretch and continued willingly in that path to close the gap. STAR JUANCHO shifted off the inside
racing to the turn tracking off the second flight, angled four wide in upper stretch and improved position between foes to the end. JERSEY JOE B, urged
inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, pressed the issue to late stages and gave out. CALL ME HANDSOME tracked off the first flight
inside rivals, saved ground to upper stretch but had no late kick. FAR FROM AWESOME, checked out of tight quarters just after the start and never
regained contention. I'M CARDINAL, urged between foes prompting the pace in the opening furlong, was held up out of tight quarters nearing the half mile
marker and faded into the stretch. PASSIONATE HACHI, bumped at the start, settled outside foes and dropped out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE
TRAINER OF I'M CARDINAL LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
DISCO'S BRIDGE, in touch with the first flight three wide between foes racing to the first turn, was held up to stalk just off the first flight nearing the
backstretch, was prompted to advance three wide racing into the far turn, bid for command in that path racing into upper stretch and wrested a clear
advantage late under firm right handed encouragement. SWIFT KID settled in the last while angling nearer the inside racing to the first turn, switched
outside foes racing into the far turn, advanced five wide through the far turn to upper stretch and prevailed for the place honors late. DRAMATIC KITTEN,
urged between foes pressing the pace from the outset into the first turn, dueled between rivals, then along the inside through the backstretch into the far
turn, continued in a grudging effort to midstretch but yielded late. DIVINE CONTROL tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, then
split foes just off the inside in the closing stages to just miss for a share. ADIOS BOBBY, reserved three deep in the last flight racing to the backstretch,
shifted out four wide while being urged to advance between foes on the far turn to upper stretch but had no final kick. GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY joined the
pace five wide leaving the chute, shifted inwards nearing the backstretch to press the issue three wide, then outside a rival into the far turn, dueled between
foes to upper stretch and gave out leaving the furlong marker. IT'S ME AGAIN hopped at the start, then angled to the inside early but never gained
contention. CHIT CHAT CHARMER, urged inside foes from the break pressing the pace into the backstretch, gave way after a half. ELUSIVE ARTY was off
last, switched outside foes to make brief progress four wide racing into the far turn but came up empty in the drive. CLEAR WONDER, urged to contend four
wide between foes racing to the first turn, was held up outside a rival tracking off the first flight nearing the backstretch but dropped out after a half.

Footnotes
KRAMDEN, forwardly placed two deep stalking a rival's pace under light rating racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue outside that foe on the far turn,
was fanned three wide racing into upper stretch losing some position to AGRIPINO but produced a steady late response to just edge that foe in time under
firm handling. The latter gained a forward placing inside foes racing to the first turn, stalked just off the pacesetter along the rail through the backstretch into
the second bend, came through inside foes to gain the advantage when presented an opening in upper stretch, held sway to late stages but just failed to
contain the winner. NO TIME TO YAWN sped to the lead outside a rival leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin a bit off the rail racing into
the far turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch, couldn't match terms with the top pair in the drive but narrowly prevailed between foes for a share. JOY
CITY tracked off the leaders three deep between foes racing to the first turn, shifted out four wide after a half, was prompted to advance in that path racing
into upper stretch but had no late kick. ROBIN TEAM SHOW, reserved in the last flight while pulling between foes racing to the backstretch, angled to the
rail nearing upper stretch and improved position to the end. UGLY DUCKLING tracked off the second between foes to the far turn but had no closing bid.
GENERAL, reluctant to load in the gate, was settled outside foes racing four wide to the backstretch, continued five wide into the lane and finished in hand
while failing to menace. LITTLE TEQUILA tracked off the second flight inside foes racing to the backstretch and faded early. TALON, caught widest racing to
the backstretch, angled to the rail after a half but lacked a rally. CHAMPIONSHIP ALLEY, forwardly placed four wide racing to the first turn, emptied out
early.
