Footnotes
AWFULLY FOXY lacked speed, circled the turn three deep, floated to the five path in upper stretch, rallied outside horses, led late and was edging away at
the finish. MY WAY OR ELSE saved ground on the turn disputing the pace, drifted to the two path entering the stretch, opened a clear advantage in mid
stretch and finished gamely on her left lead while drifting out. GARY DOING BIZ stalked the pace two wide around the turn, remained in the two path in the
stretch, was caught in narrow quarters near the eighth pole and finished willingly. HELLO GRACIE saved ground on the turn, hugged the inner rail through
the stretch, was well positioned in mid stretch and lacked the necessary late response. CINCONOLA bumped COWGIRL NIGHT when bearing in at the
break, disputed the pace outside MY WAY OR ELSE and weakened the final furlong. INFINITE REWARD stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide,
floated to the four path in upper stretch and gave way. COWGIRL NIGHT , bumped leaving the staring gate, trailed.

Footnotes
SUZZETTE STAR , brushed at the break, had speed between foes then rated back off the leaders heading to the half mile marker, dropped in soon after,
eased out four wide into the lane, closed steadily under pressure and got up in the final strides. THUNDERINTHEVALLEY stalked three wide, took closer
order mid turn, bid two wide outside the leader in upper stretch, drifted in while dueling and exchanged a brush in mid stretch, lugged in when clearing inside
the sixteenth pole, kept on gamely but could not fend off the winner. SCARLET'S SONG chased inside, eased out for the drive then went evenly late. ALL
ABOUT AUDREY was lightly steadied off heels nearing the turn, lost ground four wide mid turn, came six wide for the drive and had a slight response.
LUCKY LINDSEY sped clear in the opening furlong, dropped in to set the pace, was joined in upper stretch, brushed with THUNDERINTHEVALLEY when
battling past the furlong grounds and faded. BROADWAY TROUPER , off the pace, saved ground mid turn and failed to threaten. LILY CHASER broke
outward, chased off the rail and weakened. CHELICHNA, was outrun

Footnotes
FIND YOUR BOAZ saved ground the first turn, raced in the two path between horses the far turn, angled to the five path in upper stretch, closed outside
horses and was up at the wire. BLUE SKY PAINTER , steadied in traffic leaving the backstretch, worked between horses in the stretch, gained the lead
inside the sixteenth pole, switched to his left lead late and just missed. ROCKIN RON , a forward factor the opening quarter mile, dropped back a bit on the
far turn, raced along the inner rail most of the trip and passed tired ones late. POLITICAL lacked speed, swung to the six path in upper stretch, raced
outside horses and passed tired ones. CHARGE AHEAD set the pace in the two path, opened up in mid stretch and weakened in the drive. GOTTAWAY ,
taken to the five path in upper stretch, failed to be a factor. TWINSTINCT stumbled leaving the starting gate, circled the far turn three wide and weakened.
STAND MY GROUND stalked the pace, advanced three wide on the far turn then weakened through the strech.

IT'S SIZZLING TIME sprinted clear early, set a rated pace, raced two wide into the lane, remained clear under a drive past the furlong grounds then held
sway in the final yards. SUE LOVES BARBADOS , in range between runners nearing the half mile marker, came three wide for the drive, made a grinding
run but ran out of ground. PALATIAL TIMES settled off the pace, edged up between rivals nearing the quarter pole, shifted four wide and closed steadliy.
DOUBLEOSEVEN chased the pace while saving ground but came up empty in the final furlong. GOLDEN GULLEY , in close between runners leaving the
five furlong marker, dropped in around the turn, came back out for the drive and offered a mild kick. MINISTRY OF MAGIC , brushed at the break, steadied
in the opening furlong, dropped off the pace and failed to recover. BOBBY TWO TIMES , three wide outside foes nearing the half mile marker, failed to kick
on leaving the three eighths and retreated.

Footnotes
LADY FOX settled well off the rail, commenced a run leaving the half mile marker, gained four wide into the lane, was roused clear near the three sixteenths
and widened while ridden out. CAR LADY lagged well back and off the inside, was put to pressure leaving the far turn, circled five wide in pursuit of the
winner into the stretch, kept on willingly and was well clear of the rest. IMAGINE VICTORY , unhurried early while outside a rival, dropped in around the
turn, came back out to make a run between foes in mid stretch, altered out with a sixteenth to go and churned on. DELANCEY'S PHILLY tracked two wide,
went after the leader leaving the far turn, shook clear into the lane, was overtaken past the quarter pole and weakened. ROCKSTAR GIRL , four wide within
range past the five eighths, shifted in a bit and stalked behind foes mid turn, came back out for the drive, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and
faded. DUCHES OF GRACE flashed a bit of early foot then was rated back off rivals and content to save ground, dropped further back around the turn,
stayed inside into the stretch but came up empty. THEA'S THEME cleared early and set the pace towards the rail, took pressure past the half mile pole,
stayed in contact to upper stretch then surrendered. TOMA stalked three wide, lodged a mild bid outside runners exiting the far turn, failed to kick on while
under pressure into the lane and faltered.

PAISLEY SINGING prompted the pace outside FRIEND ME CHARLIE around the turn, took the lead in upper stretch, opened a clear advantage in mid
stretch and lasted under brisk urging. SARAH'S TREASURE stalked the pace two wide on the turn, eased out to the three path entering the stretch and
rallied outside the winner. FRIEND ME CHARLIE set the pace along the rail, was challenged by the winner entering the stretch and faded in the drive.
PROMENADE PRINCESS saved ground on the turn, eased out to the two path in mid stretch and finished evenly. PATRIOTIC PUNCH lacked speed,
worked between horses on the turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch and came up empty. QUIET IMAGINATION was not a factor. GIMME'S
GOLDENGIRL , up close four deep leaving the backstretch, gave way on the turn.

DIXIE DRAWL , four wide into the first turn, dropped in a path and was perched off the embattled leaders past the five eighths, asserted himself and forged
to command near the three eighths, shook clear heading towards the lane and drew away while kept to a steady drive. PLOT THE DOTS settled in range
while saving ground, angled out for room around the far turn, circled three wide pursuing the winner into the lane but failed to generate a legitimate stretch
kick. CLOSER LOOK cleared early and secured the rail, was headed near the seven eighths, vied under rating into the backstretch then shook clear with a
half mile remaining, could not turn back the winner past the three eighths, stayed on willingly to about mid stretch then faded. AUTOMATE , between
runners near the five eighths, moved out and chased three wide leaving the three furlong marker but lacked a solid response. BOBBY G was steadied along
off heels around the first turn, recovered to save ground off the pace, angled out mid way on the final turn but failed to make an impact. MALTHAEL ,
brushed at the break, rushed up two wide and poked a head in front mid way on the first turn, disputed the pace outside CLOSER LOOK to about the half
mile pole, failed to keep pace past the three eighths and retreated. REAL FACTOR lost ground four wide through the opening half mile and faltered.

WORKIN ON A DREAM saved ground on the turn setting a pressured pace, sprinted clear in upper stretch and held sway under urging. FAST CASH lacked
speed, raced three wide on the turn, floated to the four path in upper stretch, split rivals in mid stretch and closed nicely. SILENT MALICE circled the turn
three deep, was fanned five deep in upper stretch, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. JAMMIN STILL chased the pace racing near the rail, eased
out three wide leaving the turn and weakened. DOOBIEDOOBIEDOOBIE , two wide between horses on the turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch
and failed to rally in an even effort. WELLING raced along the inner rail, failed to be a factor and was checked in close quarters near the eighth pole.
PYSER'S ORB prompted the pace outside the winner, gave way in upper stretch and was eased.
