Footnotes
BIG WIN stalked the p[ace into the turn, rallied three wide to make the lead in upper stretch then finished full of run to win as much the best while under a
strong hand ride late. BELLA BASORA chased the pace into the turn, loomed boldly two wide past the five sixteenths pole then was no match for the winner
while clearly second best. NATIVE VALLEY unhurried early, swung wide and had a mild late rally. DIANNA'S JET broke slowly, saved ground and went
evenly. LOVE'S TAVITO failed to menace. GO ESTRELLA broke in front, set the pace for three furlongs, had speed into the stretch then weakened late.
SUMMER WAR well placed, failed to respond. ROYALANDTOULOUSE showed little. MISS PAMMIE SUE was outrun. EXPECT was no factor.

L. A. STAR never far back, closed fast in the four path through the stretch and was along in time. TURN TO ME SUCREE close up from the start, split
horses three then two wide on the turn, quickly opened a daylight lead, set the balance of the pace then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner.
FRIDAY had a mild late rally in the five path. MISS PINKERTON stalked the early pace, loomed boldly three wide midway on the turn, had speed into the
stretch then came up empty. MISS IRISH BOSS failed to menace. COMPANYS COMING dueled for the lead two wide into the turn then weakened in the
stretch. MERENGUE dueled for the lead along the inside into the turn then gave way. URBAN KAT was outrun.
