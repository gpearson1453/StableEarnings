Footnotes
THREE PHASE raced three wide early, stalked three wide, bid three wide nearing the far turn, dueled briefly, took over, drew clear, drifted out under left
handed urging in front of FLAT BILL at the sixteenth marker, then dug in and maintained a clear lead to the wire. FLAT BILL raced off the pace, advanced
on the far turn, rallied in upper stretch, drifted in a bit passing the eighth pole, then steadied behind the winner and steadied again slightly nearing the wire.
SIGHT LINE vied two wide, dueled entering the far turn, weakened and dug in to save the show spot. LOST IRON raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up
three wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. MUCHO MAS GRANDE raced off the pace and did not factor. FINANCIAL FREEDOM vied inside, chased and
gave way. After a Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey Objection by the rider of FLAT BILL against the winner, THREE PHASE was disqualified and placed second
for interference in the stretch run.

THORNY TALE went after the pacesetter into the far turn, vied through the turn and held on gamely. NAUGHTY PRINCE saved ground on the turn, angled
out nearing the quarter pole, rallied, loomed a threat but hung. VERO SUN trailed well behind in the opening half mile then offered late energy. SARGEANT
DRIVE chased wide throughout and flattened in the stretch. G DADDY quickly sprinted away through the opening quarter, vied on the turn and faded.
DOUGIE dropped back early, angled inside and was never a factor. MY DANZIG PARTNER was urged close up three wide to the turn and gave way.

out on the final turn, rallied but was second best. KINGSVILLE saved ground down the backstretch and continued willingly. DIAMOND SETTER dueled
between rivals and then inside and weakened in the stretch. REGAL QUALITY dropped back after the start and lacked a solid rally. BOB'S MY UNCLE
chased outside and began fading after half a mile. SEMI EXCITED was fanned five wide on the first turn and gave way readily. NOBIZ LIKE JETBIZ dueled
along the inside to the far turn and faded. POSTINO'S VOW dropped back early and trailed throughout.
