Footnotes
GILDED APPLE settled near the back under some urging, went three wide under stronger encouragement on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch,
rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to win going away. GLITTER TIME chased the pace on the outside, made a bid at the
seven-sixteenths, vied in the three path on the turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole, shook clear while still on her inside lead coming to the furlong marker,
swapped to the proper lead shortly thereafter, shortened stride into the final sixteenth then drifted in and bothered a foe while overtaken but was clear for
second. MAGIC COY was hustled from the start while breaking last then urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, gained coming to
the quarter-pole but flattened out while able to get the show. HIP FLASK broke in but was away fast, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside of
the runner-up in the two path on the turn, lost the lead to that foe at the quarter-pole, chased under a drive into the final sixteenth, checked when the
GLITTER TIME came in at that point and weakened then lost the show. G'S MINE was sent hard from the start, had the rider lost his balance briefly inside
the five-eighths, raced inside to the two path on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. GALAXY STAR settled off the pace, raced
inside to the two path on the turn, was urged into the stretch and failed to threaten. DIVIDED was ridden along on the outside, went four then five wide on
the turn then was driven six wide into the stretch and was no factor. FROIDEUR chased the pace on the inside of a rival, dropped back while lugging out
four wide leaving the backstretch, moved to the two path outside the three-eighths and retreated. CAUSEWAYCAT was urged along at the rear, went
around the turn in the two path and showed little. BLESSED VILLANA raced on the far outside while wearing a goggle on a blind right eye, was taken up
while traveling awkwardly around the half-mile pole then pulled out the race then vanned off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, GLITTER TIME WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED FOURTH FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE SIXTEENTH-POLE

Footnotes
G'WILDCAT bumped soundly with a rival at the start but came out in front, went clear early and controlled the action, was challenged while inside on the
turn then asked at the quarter-pole, responded well when put to a drive in upper stretch, shook clear inside the furlong marker, swapped back to his inside
lead just inside the sixteenth-pole and proved best under steady handling. JANETS JAY JAY bumped solidly with a foe after the start, was rated under snug
restraint then asked in the three path on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the place. CREOLE CHARLIE tracked the pace
on the outside, made a bid while dropping from three to two wide on the turn, turned into the stretch on ever terms for the lead, drifted out when put to a
left-handed whip approaching the furlong marker, was switched to a right-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened but was clear for the show.
BERNIE SPECIAL bumped hard with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground under urging on the turn
and came up empty. PERFECT PERIGEE chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back in the two path on the turn and tired. GET THEM JUSTIN
was reserved on the outside, went four wide while let out on the turn, dropped back while still on his inside lead in upper stretch and failed to respond.
SCHNELL was last to commence then bumped solidly with a foe after the start, raced at the rear under urging, went four then five wide on the turn then was
driven six wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
SPUN D'ETAT broke out while hustled from the start, went around the first turn in the three path, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the two to
three path on the far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch, switched back to her inside lead while put to a right-handed whip outside the furlong marker, drifted
in some at that point, drew off under the whip into the final sixteenth then was placed under a hand ride, swapped back to the proper lead late and proved
much the best. PRINCESS D'ORO broke out at the start, settled at the back of the trio on the inside, came under some urging early on the far turn, was
roused while shifting three wide near the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch under the whip and proved no match for the winner while clear for
second. KILLER DRESS went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, set the pace through sensible fractions, vied inside to the two path while
challenged by the winner on the far turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
AVAILABLE STAR broke out at the start, contested the pace on the inside, shook clear outside the three-sixteenths and drew off under a strong hand ride to
prove much the best. M V P MOOKIE bumped with a rival at the start, bumped hard with foes on both sides early, went around the first turn in the two path,
settled off the pace, was urged along midway down the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn and safely secured the place. STRIKING STAR bumped
with a foe at the start, bumped hard with rivals on both sides early, went three to four wide on the turns, came six wide into the stretch then steadied behind
horses outside the furlong marker and got up for the show. MISS YOU JO went around the first turn in the two path, settled near the back, was urged along
in the two path on the far turn, bumped with a foe outside the quarter-pole then checked and failed to threaten. GUITAR KING bumped hard with a rival after
the start, went three wide on the first turn, was ridden along on the backstretch, raced four wide on the far turn and came up empty. CHAMBLISS went four
wide on the first turn, settled on the outside near the middle of the field, moved in with a half-mile to run, saved ground on the far turn, bumped with MISS
YOU JO outside the quarter-pole, moved out outside the sixteenth-pole and failed to respond. FLEET RUN broke out at the start, went four wide on the first
turn, stalked the pace on the outside, dropped back three wide on the far turn, drifted in near the furlong marker and capitulated. EATORBEEATEN bumped
hard with rivals on both sides after the start, raced in the two path on the first turn, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn,
dropped back three wide into the stretch and faded. LITTLE RED KID saved ground towards the rear and faltered then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT was hustled from the start, went three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn,
took the lead into the stretch, drifted out near the three-sixteenths, shook clear into the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. FREEDOMFI went
three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged two to three wide on the far turn then came four wide into the stretch, drifted in under a drive
around the furlong marker and finished with good energy for the place. GUITAR TRIBUTE was off slow, saved ground on the first turn, settled well back in
the field, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch, drifted in under a right-handed whip near the furlong marker,
steadied behind horses coming to the sixteenth-pole then altered to the outside and finished with good energy to just miss the place while able to get the
show. MISTER INTUITION saved ground on the first turn, moved out early on the backstretch, bumped with a foe outside the five-eighths, was well placed
into the far turn, went two to three wide on that bend, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, chased into the final furlong and weakened. IN CHARGE
HALO went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside of the winner on the far turn, lost the lead
into the stretch and gave way. DON GUILLERMO went around the first turn in the two path, settled on the inside of a rival, was ridden along while saving
ground on the far turn and failed to threaten. LOVE CONQUERS was hustled from the start, raced in the two path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the
outside, made a bid while three to four wide on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated. LES PAUL went four then three wide on the
first turn, steadied and was forced out when REMEMBERMIS took very awkward strides nearing the five-eighths, saved ground on the far turn and was no
factor. REMEMBERMIS rounded the first turn in the two path, was taken up out of the race while taking very awkward strides near the five-eighths and was
pulled up but walked off.

EASY TO BLESS pressed the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure on the leader in the two path on the turn, took the advantage outside the
quarter-pole, kicked clear inside the three-sixteenths and drew away under steady urging. CAVIAR RESOLUTION settled off the pace, was urged along in
the two path on the turn, moved out some under a drive in upper stretch and earned the place while no match for the winner. STYLIN UPTOWN was away
alertly, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was headed outside the quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive in upper
stretch and tired but held the show. WAVE OF GOODNESS broke a half-step slow then was hustled, raced on the outside under urging, went three wide on
the turn and lacked the needed response. BODIE ON POINTE broke awkwardly and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, moved out near the
five-eighths, went five wide on the turn and was no factor. DIAMOND LILY broke a half-step slow, settled well off the pace, dropped back leaving the
backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, lost her footing slightly while three wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MOLIERE broke out and bumped with a foe then jostled with that rival early, saved ground on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, moved from
the two path to the four path on the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch under the whip, took the lead at the three-sixteenths, battled outside of the
runner-up in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. ABSAM bumped with a rival at the start then jostled with that foe early, went to the
front, set the pace in the two path, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the lead outside the three-sixteenths, fought on gamely in the final furlong and just
missed while well clear for the place. WIN D'ORO was taken up while crowded against the rail early, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the
pace, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the far turn, shifted back to the two path under urging at the quarter-pole and lacked the needed
response while well clear for the show. DEFIED went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked while three wide inside the
three-eighths, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch and tired. CITIZEN WEST bumped with foes on both sides at the start, jostled with those foes
early then swerved out nearing the first turn, went five then four wide on that bend, was forwardly placed on the outside, dropped back midway down the
backstretch, was ridden along while four wide on the far turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
KENTUCKY SUMMER went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was urged along while inside on the far turn, shifted three wide into the
stretch, chased the runner-up into the final furlong, took the lead into the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. TREASURY broke out then
bumped lightly with a foe, went to the front, set the pace on the inside, was asked outside the three-sixteenths, led under a drive into the final furlong, lost
the lead into the final sixteenth and missed while clear for the place. GOLD DOUBLE broke out at the start, traveled around the first turn in the two path,
dropped back early on the backstretch while settling off the pace, was urged four wide early on the far turn, moved to six wide to go around a drifting foe
around the five-sixteenths then dropped back to the four path, gained into the stretch under the whip and lacked the needed kick while well clear for the
show. EKATI'S VERVE steadied outside the seven-eighths, moved from three to five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged in the two path
on the far turn and failed to respond. GRAVES MILL ROAD shifted from the rail to the three path over heels early on the first turn, settled at the back, went
five wide on the far turn and was no factor. BREEZY MONEY went five then four wide on the first turn, followed the solo leader from second, went three
wide early on the turn then moved to the four path, dropped back while lugging out five wide around the five-sixteenths and faltered. GET THE NET bumped
lightly with a rival at the start, went three to four wide on the turns and faltered badly.

Footnotes
DREAMALILDREAMOFU raced in the three path on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader at the seven-sixteenths, vied
in the two path on the far turn, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, drew away under a strong hand ride into the final
sixteenth then was eased up late while much the best. SINGITA DREAMS brushed with a foe early on the first turn, went four wide on that bend, tracked the
pace on the outside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole then came under the whip, went three wide under strong urging on the turn and earned the
place while no match for the winner. TEENAGE KICKS went to the front, set the pace on the inside of the winner while along the rail, was urged along on
the far turn, lost the lead coming to the quarter-pole and tired while well clear for third. GINNY B was keen under restraint early on the first turn, raced in the
two path on that bend, settled towards the rear, was urged along while inside on the far turn and failed to respond. SENSIBLE MYTH brushed with a foe
early on the first turn, went three wide on that bend, was rated off the pace, came under urging in the two path on the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
TUCKER THE GROUCH saved ground on the first turn, settled well off the pace, was hard ridden while inside early on the far turn, shifted to the two path to
go around a foe midway through that bend then dropped back to the rail, moved out while gaining in upper stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and
closed strongly to wing going away. GREY SLOAN was hustled from the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled in third position, gained three to
four wide on the far turn, took the lead into the final furlong, came in slightly near the sixteenth-pole and was overtaken while clear for the place. SNEAKY
ALLIE KAT went around the first turn in the two path, settled in the middle of the spread out field, was urged along while moving from three to five wide on
the far turn and finished willingly for the show. NOCOMET contested the pace on the inside, shook clear leaving the backstretch, was asked on the far turn,
turned into the stretch in the two path then came under the whip, lost the advantage into the final furlong, hesitated when the runner-up came in around the
sixteenth-pole and weakened. RAY'S KIMUA went four wide on the first turn, settled in fourth position, was ridden along while three wide on the far turn,
came four wide into the stretch, drifted inward in the final furlong and failed to rally. C F JOHNATHAN bumped with a rival at the start, angled in nearing the
first turn, went three wide on that bend, settled well back in the field, was urged four then five wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed
to threaten. MR. OLD HAT bumped with a rival at the start, brushed with a foe into the first turn, went five then four wide on that bend, was urged along well
back in the field, went five then four wide on the far turn, dropped to the two path into the stretch, moved out outside the sixteenth-pole and was no factor.
JUSTIN'SMEMORIES went four to six wide on the turns and was no factor. SEMI CHARMED LIFE broke out and was off a bit slow, was caught seven wide
on the first turn, angled in near the five-eighths pole, lagged at the rear and showed little. YANKEE CLIPPER broke out and brushed with a foe, raced in the
three path on the first turn, contested the pace on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, came up empty while three wide on the far turn and
retreated. THEOS FLEW broke in the air and was off slow, went four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, dropped back while inside on the far turn and
faltered.
