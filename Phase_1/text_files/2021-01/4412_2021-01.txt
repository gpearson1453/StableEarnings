Footnotes
O'TROUBLE hustled from the gate, was out-sprinted for the top, steadied after acting unsettled getting geared down a panel into the event, tipped onto the
outer border of the inside route, went about more professionally than before tracking the pace, got maneuvered to the outside leaving the five-sixteenths
pole, would up in the neighborhood of path four a furlong down the road, closed in readily on the ones to catch, out-fought a pair of opponents to the left to
emerge a sixteenth later as the undisputed leader, extended the winning margin. STRAFE away last, attained a prominent position, prompted the leader
from path two, well rated and pulling a bit on the left, swung about one path farther off the rail into the stretch and got called upon, forged to a slim lead
despite trading some leans with MR. BUCKLEY, was forced to defend from between rivals beginning from midlane, failed, stayed on the place. MR.
BUCKLEY cut over to the inside with the advantage by the conclusion of the backstretch, led the way narrowly, accompanied by the second place finisher
from the outside, got roused a short distance from the quarter pole, shifted towards path two at the head of the stretch, got headed deep into the furlong
grounds by STRAFE with some light contact between them going on, battled onward as the innermost of a trio for the next sixteenth before weakening.
RIBBONS AND MEDALS strung out two to three wide and under a ride on the turn, gave way.

Footnotes
SUPER DUDE coaxed from the gate, established the front and shook away from the field along the inside through the first turn before taking to the two path
down the backstretch, settled into a comfortable rhythm as the field advanced with five furlongs remaining, got joined to the outside by AIR ATTACK midway
on the far turn and slipped away as a pair from the rest coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got headed spinning two to three wide for home, dug in
under a drive taking back command a furlong from home, inched away under a drive kept to task. AIR ATTACK broke out at the start bumping THE GREAT
DANSKY, raced along the inside through the first turn before tipping to the two path down the backstretch, tipped out three wide five furlongs from home and
steadily advanced on the leader into the far turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took over narrow command spinning three wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive under challenge and shied out under a near sided stick near the eighth pole yielding back the front, ran on to chase the winner
home well clear of the rest and along second best. CREATIVE STYLE three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, weakened while along for the show honors. EKHTIBAAR coaxed from the gate, chased two then three wide
coming under urging half a mile from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. THE GREAT DANSKY bumped at the start by AIR ATTACK, who
broke outwards, raced just off the inside through the opening bend then chased four to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide for
home and tired. LUCKY RAMSEY off to an awkward beginning, raced just off the inside through the first turn, chased along the inside under coaxing from
the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact.

HAVE A HEART away without apparent mishap, took up position in the pocket, patiently kept watch on the multitude of equines vying for the lead a short
distance up ahead, was on hold idling along awaiting options approaching the quarter pole, got cued up angling into the two path for entrance into the
stretch, espied a clear rail corridor for the asking and after getting taken in hand eagerly dove onto it, this occurring in the general area of the
three-sixteenths pole, unleashed an explosive kick, fought his way past a threesome of opponents to the outside just inside the eighth pole and edged clear.
APEX PREDATOR at a considerable distance from off the rail, emerged as a pace contestant by the top of the turn, went about the task from path four in
between rivals, was let loose for the drive, was still engaged with others trying to grab the front when the winner took over in midstretch, willingly won the
place. BRUNATE moved into the two path, argued for the top seemingly from between rivals the entire way before weakening late into the show slot.
ROYAL KAZ stayed stationed along the rail after the field had been sent off and running, led the way narrowly, forced to fend off a squad of foes, numbering
at the beginning four, prior to dwindling down to three by the five-sixteenths pole, shifted into the two path stepping onto the head of the stretch,
inadvertently leaving the inside open, was still going at it versus outside pressure when the top one took over, fought onward then backed away in the final
stages. MIGHTY WIND stacked five wide, contended for the top as the outmost of a quintet at the top of the turn, and then as the outermost of a quartet
from the five-sixteenths pole to midlane before giving way. BRICKYARD worked out a tuck into the two path before departing the backstretch, got set down
at the five-sixteenths pole, got driven five wide into the lane, made no impact. HEREISSIO lunged at the break, underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn,
got maneuvered into path six from upper to midstretch, failed to gain significantly. MOONSHINE MAKER set up in the three path, battled for command from
between rivals for most of the trip of the turn, folded. DON MARTIN guided over to the rail at the half mile pole, trailed.

Footnotes
BUYER'S REMORSE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, edged away under a drive
holding well to the finish to prevail. LOOKBOTHWAYS chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper
stretch, was hemmed in behind the leader straightened away as BLITCHTON LADY came inwards, gained clearance inside the eighth pole, had the rider
lose the handle on the whip nearing the sixteenth pole and ran on to secure the place honors. PENDOLINO chased four wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, continued four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive tipping out slightly as BLITCHTON LADY came out under a near side stick
slightly offering a mild bid, then flattened out in the late stages while clear for the show honors. BLITCHTON LADY three wide in closest aim of the leader,
advanced through the turn to get on near even terms five-sixteenths from home, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, shied out slightly
under a near sided stick nearing the eighth pole, got corrected and came inwards at that station, then weakened through to the finish. BONUS BABY four
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. JACKIE MILTON coaxed from the gate, chased three
wide under a ride from midway on the turn, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
MR PHIL took up position in midpack after the field had sent on its way, was two to three wide in pursuit of the front runners on the bend, sat on hold poised
to strike as the half was being rattled off, angled five wide for racing room stepping onto the head of the stretch, responded when given his cue, arriving at
the eighth pole full of momentum, maintained it, rolling by THE BIG S in the final seventy yards to prove best. THE BIG S retained the advantage after
out-breaking the competition, gradually made its way over to the inside route, cut the splits, well rated on a loosely-contested lead, settled in upper stretch
and was switched over to stronger handling, was yet comfortably in front by the beginning of the final furlong but the eventual winner bearing down hard
from the outside, relinquished with less than a sixteenth to go, had no trouble salvaging second. BIG BOY MO stalked the pace from the two path, got
roused spinning into the lane, kept at the task at hand before weakening in the final sixteenth. BULWARK three wide onto the turn, was in path four exiting
it, made no headway. BREITHORN chased the pace from path two, was in the same one entering the stretch, gave way. VICTORY BUILT spotted into the
two path prior to arriving at the conclusion of the backstretch, got set out six wide from upper to midlane, launched no bids. FOUR OF SWORDS off the
inside, travelled in the three path on the turn, went as wide into the lane, had no offering. STANHOPE set up in the pocket at the half mile pole, faltered.

PONCHO SONG got worked into the two path prior to leaving the backstretch, inched up to the front runners before getting put to a drive coming up to the
five-sixteenths pole, angled four wide into the lane, kicked in and narrowed the gap during the ensuing furlong, wore down the leader inside the sixteenth
pole and drew clear. TIMED OUT towards the inside route during the initial stages, appeared unsettled after the first fraction had been finalized, tried to
ease its way to the outside, eventually did so after bulying PAZZION out of position at the top of the turn, went onward for another furlong then slithered her
way into the three path, went on to contest the pace as the widest of a threesome from that juncture until deep into the furlong grounds, got called upon for
more springing from the five-sixteenths pole, took control, held its largest advantage with a furlong to go but with the top one bearing down from the outside,
yielded inside the sixteenth pole then watched the winner edge away in the final seventy yards. PAZZION pursued the pace primarily from the three path
after making contact with MS WICKED in the shadow of the starting gate, lost some position after being bumped by the second place finisher right around
the half mile pole, went into the stretch, proved no match. TAP THE BARREL sparred for control from path two, was under a drive coming home, gave way.
TAKE IT OFF argued for command after bumping with its next stall neighbor at the start, came under aim from the winner as the field stepped onto the head
of the stretch, yielded then backed away steadily in the last eighth. MISS COMEDIAN strung out four wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one path
farther off the rail, gave way after undergoing the widest journey of all. MS WICKED bobbled in between suffering bumps from both sides at the start, got
guided over to the inside route, spun three wide onto the top of the lane under a protective hold, was then allowed to fade away.

Footnotes
MY AMANJENA stumbled at the start and was bumped by ALLIED INVASION breaking outwards, raced forwardly placed just off the inside through the first
turn before tipping four wide into the backstretch, advanced under a hold on the leader latching on five furlongs from home, tucked to the two path into the
far turn, took over command three furlongs out, shook away through the latter portion of the turn and was let out swinging four to five wide into upper stretch,
then went clear under a drive to prevail. KING OF AMERICAN four then three wide through the first turn, chased four paths off the inside from near the rear
of the field, tucked three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and kicked on
belatedly threading his way through traffic a furlong out to just get up in the final jump and secure the place honors. ALLIED INVASION broke out at the start
bumping MY AMANJENA and came under hustling, knocked heads from the two path through the first turn with GLENN LIKES GIN to his inside,
established sole command into the backstretch, showed the way from the two path coming under some pressure from the presence of MY AMANJENA to
the outside five furlongs from home, tucked inside half a mile out, got displaced from command at the three-eighths and was placed to coaxing at that
juncture, spun just off the inside for home shaken off by the top one and weakened in the late stages getting nailed for the place honors on the wire. OPEN
LENGTHS coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and
weakened. SUPER WICKED CHARM stumbled at the start pecking the ground, raced three wide into the first turn before tucking along the inside near at
the tail of the field, saved ground and tipped to the two path through the far turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out six wide into
upper stretch and passed tired rivals in the stretch. FOTIS three wide through the first turn, chased five then four wide under coaxing from midway on the far
turn, went eight wide into upper stretch and tired. GLENN LIKES GIN forwardly placed from the start, dueled inside through the first turn with ALLIED
INVASION to his outside, succumbed the front and chased along the inside down the backstretch in range of the leader, came under coaxing three furlongs
from home, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. SHADOW CASTER four wide into the first turn, went three wide through that turn and chased
three wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was backing away when
paused in tight a furlong out, then tired through to the finish. HEALY'S HOPE just off the inside through the first turn, raced three to four wide in pursuit,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and tired.
