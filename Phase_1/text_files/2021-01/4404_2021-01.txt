Footnotes
MISTY TASTE four then three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and advanced, swung five then four
wide into upper stretch straightened away, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, drew clear under a drive getting geared down in the late stages.
IDAKA stumbled at the start, recovered to chase four then three wide down the backstretch before going two to three wide through the turn placed to
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, tipped out straightened away and improved position for the place honors. CRICK chased
five then four wide down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide for home and
weakened. SWEET SNEAK prompted the pace two to three wide, advanced to take command five-sixteenths from home, got set down spinning just off the
inside into upper stretch, yielded command near the three-sixteenths and weakened. MIZZYS IMAGE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, made no impact. LOVE THAT FACE established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside
under some pressure from SWEET SNEAK to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when headed for command, took the inside route into
upper stretch and tired. CENTRAL CAPITAL chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and
tired. AFLEETING GLANCE stumbled badly at the start falling to her face and lost the rider as a result. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the start prior to
the race being declared official.

Footnotes
LOVELY LADY LEXI off the inside throughout, departed the backstretch from path three, flashed some interest as the second split was being finalized,
swung out towards path four for entrance into the stretch then was given her cue at the three-sixteenths pole, raced as a team with the runner up towards
the one to catch, went by, vied onward with good determination with DUBLINORNOTHIN in the last eighth and proved best. DUBLINORNOTHIN sparred for
command from path two, was one path farther off the rail challenging in earnest at the three-sixteenths pole, rallied in tandem with the winner going by NO
DEAL, went at it one on one with the top one in the final furlong, got denied. NO DEAL argued for the top from along the inside, came under heavy pressure
at the furlong grounds, yielded and weakened. COVER PHOTO kept watch on the front runners from just off the inside route, angled three wide for the
drive, mustered up a mild response. BLUNT FORCE chased the pace three wide on the turn, got sent out into path five from upper to midstretch, launched
no bids. MISS LIANA taken hold of after coming out with her initial step, stayed within range from the pocket for the opening half, got driven two to three
wide heading for the three-sixteenths pole, lacked the necessary response. EVAN'S NICE NOW four wide at the top of the turn, was in the same path at the
head of the stretch, backed away.

Footnotes
STEAM ENGINE established the top after being set down to an abbreviated brisk hand ride springing from the starting gate, cut over nearer to the rail,
showed the way on a loosely-contested advantage, straddling the outer rim of the inside route, shifted into the two path when asked for more at the head of
the stretch, saw the runner up whittling away at the deficit in the last eighth, dug in late to preserve the decision. DARK MONEY kept watch on the winner
while saving ground during the initial stages, inched his way into the two path at the top of the turn, was patently ridden stalking the winner, got cued up
angling three wide for the drive, gained some ground in the late stages, got staved off. SICILIA MIKE contently brought up the back of the pack, spotted just
off the inside on the turn, got sent out five wide from upper to midstretch, went on to secure the show. VICAR'S LEGEND rode the rail, cut the corner into
the stretch, made no headway. KOSCIUSZKO chased the pace from path three, got turned loose a short distance from the quarter pole, went into the
stretch and backed away. RUNAWAY LUTE brushed at the start, travelled three to four wide on the turn, was more the latter spinning into the stretch, tired.
MANIFEST DESTINY pursued the pace three wide after making some contact with RUNAWAY LUTE in the shadow of the starting gate, was put to
encouragement after entering the turn, commenced the stretch slightly closer to the rail, folded.

DADDY KNOWS cemented itself into a forward position, disputed the pace primarily from the three path for nearly three-quarters, moved when ready
coming up to the quarter pole, settled in upper stretch and was called upon for more, emerged a sixteenth down the road leading by its largest margin, felt
the presence of the second place finisher in the final stages, but held late to prevail. DURKIN'S CALL off the inside throughout, was unhurried three wide on
the turn, angled out six wide for the drive, becoming the widest of all, clawed his way towards the one to catch, came up short. VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD
bumped with CHARLIE MCCOY at the start, recovered in short order and took up residence in midpack, was in path three taking up the chase on the turn,
came under urging swinging five wide into the lane, finished with willingness down the center of the strip to earn the show. JUST RIGHT forwardly placed
from along the inside route, got moved out into path four turning onto the top of the lane, stayed on well in the final furlong for the final significant slice of the
purse. THE CARETAKER lightly bumped shortly after the start, got guided over to the rail at the top of the backstretch, went on to save ground to no avail.
BIG MOUNTAIN remained stationed in the two path, vied for command matched up with the winner for six furlongs, stepped into the lane and folded.
BEACH ACCESS made light contact with THE CARETAKER shortly after the field had been released, tucked into the two path, went into the stretch and
had no offering. CHARLIE MCCOY sat reserved two wide for three-quarters after bumping with VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD at the start, came four wide onto
the head of the stretch and gave out.

command a furlong out, tussled with the runner up to the sixteenth marker before inching away to the finish kept busy to the end. BUSTIN SHOUT broke in
at start forcing MANOLITO to be steadied in behind, prompted the leader from the outside in the two path coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took
over command spinning three wide for home, dug in under threat and was headed a furlong out, fought on to the sixteenth pole before being shaken off late.
MORNING BREEZ three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show
honors. ZAEVION three wide in pursuit, got set down angled five to six wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. SPEIGHTFUL KITTEN chased
four wide coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, weakened. FOOLISH GHOST bumped at the start by MANOLITO
breaking inwards, showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from BUSTIN SHOUT to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
yielded the front and took the inside route into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. MANOLITO broke in at the start bumping FOLLISH GHOST then got
steadied as BUSTIN SHOUT came inwards and conceded four lengths to the front, chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide for

Footnotes
A LONGLONGTIMEAGO got worked into the two path on the backstretch, was well rated keeping watch on the contested pace within striking distance,
remained on hold awaiting options late on the bend, got roused angling four wide onto the top of the lane, straightened and took off in earnest after the ones
to catch, got engaged in a tussle with ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE at the beginning of the final furlong, wore down that pesky opponent inside the sixteenth pole
and edged away. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE away without apparent mishap, departed the backstretch from the three path, hitched up to the front runners,
contended for the top as the outermost of a trio, got cued for the drive home, forged to the front end during the ensuing furlong, was pounced upon by the
winner, relinquished reluctantly with less than a sixteenth to go, kept going well to finish comfortably clear of the others for the place. REGGAE MUSIC MAN
set to a brisk hand ride springing from the gate, argued for control versus two others from the outside for the opening half, stepped into the lane, remained
prominently placed for a little while longer then weakened in the final eighth. VODKA LEMONADE took up residence in midpack, was strung out four wide
on the turn, fanned out into path seven from upper to midstretch, lacked the necessary response. PURPLE HEARTED along the outside, was under a ride
racing three wide on the turn, got steered into path six for the drive, had no offering. FORGOTTEN MISSION bumped with TACO BEAN at the start, was
sighted two to three wide during the run around the bend, came approximately five wide into the stretch, made no impact. BIG BROWN SHOES remained
forwardly placed after the start, moved into the three path, was one of three vying for the top for nearly a half, going about the task from path two in between
rivals on the turn, made it into the stretch and gave way. FORTY TWO ACE an early pace contestant, shifted into the pocket at the top of the turn, saw the
pilot hand urge the mount along, tipped into path two for the commencement of the stretch run, tired. ROGUE LEADER slid over to the rail at the half mile
pole, angled into path four heading onto the top of the lane, never got involved. TACO BEAN bumped at the start, brought up the back of the pack from path
two, went slightly wider into the stretch on empty.
