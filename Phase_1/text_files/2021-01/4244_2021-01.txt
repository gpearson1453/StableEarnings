and got up. LURE HIM IN bumped leaving the gate, settled outside a rival, bumped from inside entering the stretch, rallied through the final furlong and
missed. RUSTIC CANYON raced mid-pack early, went up inside a pair of rivals near the seven-sixteenths pole, tipped out at the top of the lane, bid outside
the leader at the eighth pole, gained command and got caught in the closing moments. THREE AY EM trailed the field early and angled to the inside, angled
out around the final turn, angled back inside in the stretch and finished well for a minor share. KEYSTONE FIELD off a bit slow and bothered at the start,
vied outside a pair of rivals first time through the stretch then cleared approaching the seven-eighths. M TOWN GEM broke out, tracked the pace outside a
rival, got knocked into rival entering the stretch and could not rally. STORM THE BASTILLE (FR) vied for the lead between rivals early then stalked the
leader past the finish line first time around, raced outside a rival then three deep at the half-mile marker, traveled two to three wide around the final turn and
weakened. HONG KONG COWBOY bumped outside rival, stumbled, almost losing the rider in the process, brushed inside rival soon after, had rider regain
his left-iron then vied for the lead from inside into the stretch first time around, ceded the lead to KEYSTONE FIELD and stalked from inside then moved out
into the two path, weakened and was eased in the stretch and walked off. RAIL ON HILL ZERO FEET.

Footnotes
TRANSLATE chased the speed from inside then angled outside the leader and applied pressured, headed foe and put a nose in front at the quarter pole,
put IRISH AURA away in upper stretch and kicked clear in the final furlong. IRISH AURA sped to the front, steered inward and received pressure from
TRANSLATE, held a short lead through the turn then lost command at the quarter pole, could not go on with the winner in the final furlong and held the
place. SWEET DEVIL chased from inside then two wide into the drive and weakened. NURSE GOODBODY tracked along the inside, cut the corner into the
stretch and went evenly in the late stages. SHEZAGHOST chased outside a rival up the backstretch, between foes around the bend the bend, roused in the
lane and could not offer the needed response. NAANSENSE chased outside a rival then three wide around the bend and flattened in the furlong grounds.
AWESOME PAMELA off slow to begin, raced well off the pace, angled out upper stretch and proved no menace. WILD RIDE tossed head and came away a
bit slowly, traveled in range from outside, raced outside a pair of rivals through the turn and faded. RAYS DARLINKLE off slow at the start and took some
time to settle into stride, took the turn two wide and never got involved.

Footnotes
DESTINY'S JOURNEY established the front early, showed the way to the far turn, challenged from outside at the quarter pole, lost the lead into the stretch,
dueled and regained command at the eighth pole, drifted out in the lane and gamely prevailed. LULUMARU chased three wide around the first turn, moved
out into the four path on the backstretch, ranged up four wide around the turn and headed the leader at the quarter pole, took a short lead into the lane, lost
command at the eighth pole, drifted out in the drive and finished gamely to the wire. ETERNAL ENDEAVOUR (GB) stalked from inside, saved ground then
shifted two wide into the stretch, chased the top pair in the drive then angled inside and finished a game third. SIDE EFFECT (GB) traveled three wide then
between rivals and weakened. MONGOLIAN WINDOW settled off the pace, raced two to three wide into the lane, angled in upper stretch and lacked a rally.
JUST GRACE went four wide around the first turn, three deep into and around the second bend and weakened.

Footnotes
I GOT NO MUNNY off a bit slow to begin, chased between then moved inside, angled out into the stretch, rallied four wide and drove clear. FOLLOW THE
LUTE attended the pace three deep, bid outside the top pair around the turn, got bumped by MIDNIGHT MISTERY at the sixteenth pole and stayed on to
regain the place. MIDNIGHT MYSTERY dueled for the lead outside a rival, inched ahead at the five-sixteenths, carried a short lead to the eighth pole,
drifted out and bumped rival at with a sixteenth to go and yielded late. CANDY FURY dueled from inside into and around the turn and could not match the
the top trio in the final fulrong. MR VERRACITY raced five deep early then three deep into the turn, came four wide off the turn and never produced a bid.
TIZ VICIOUS forwardly placed early on, raced between rivals into the turn, traveled two wide then moved to the rail around the bend, shifted back into the
two path leaving the turn and weakened. BUSHIDO'S WAY tracked four wide into the turn, lost ground around while angling down to the two path, angled
back out entering the stretch and had little left.

CATEMACO vied for the lead from inside early then cleared near the half-mile pole, traveled a bit off the rail through the turn, inched away in upper stretch
and widened in the late stages. SCARY FAST SMILE tracked outside a rival, raced five wide into the turn, advanced while angling a few paths around the
turn and edged rival for the second. STARSHIP CHEWBACCA chased off the rail then closed in along the inside, steadied off the heels of the leader into
the turn, remained inside to the stretch and got outkicked for the place. QUEEN'S CODE tracked off the rail, angled in on the turn, steered back out at the
top of the lane and kept on for a minor award. STAR RACER settled off the pace, saved ground to the stretch and improved position. THE LITTLE H MAN
dropped back early, raced three wide then angled four wide into the stretch and passed tired rivals. STIR THE POT broke in and bumped rival at the start,
vied three deep early then chased the leader four wide into the turn, moved down into the three path around the bend and faded. SQUARE ROOT bumped
