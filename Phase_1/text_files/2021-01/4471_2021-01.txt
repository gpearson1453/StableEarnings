Footnotes
JOYCEE HAZ PIZZAZ at a considerable distance from off the rail, departed the backstretch from the four path, flashed interest as the second fraction was
being finalized, was given his cue spinning into the stretch, forged to the front during the ensuing ground, held on well to stay in the clear. WARFRONT
FIGHTER settled into midpack after the start, got guided over to the pocket at the top of the turn, was under a ride cutting the corner into the stretch, ground
its way to second. SCORPION DYNASTY cemented himself to the front end after being set to a brisk hand ride, carved out the pace on a loosely-contested
advantage, was put to stronger handling coming into the lane feeling an uptick in pressure, got overhauled by the winner then got overtaken by the second
place finisher while steadily weakening. CONFECTIONER underwent a three wide pursuit, swung into the lane and was outfinished. MACLEAN'S LEGACY
prompted the pacesetter from path two, went about the task from between opponents from midway on the turn until the quarter pole, stepped into the lane,
lacked a response. HEIGHT strung out three wide on the turn, failed to respond when asked to at the three-eighths pole. ACROSS THE CHANNEL steadied
after lunging out at the start, travelled three wide on the turn, got moved out towards the five path into the stretch to no avail. All riders carried an additional
two pounds in compliance with a weather-related safety initiative.

Footnotes
HALO CITY chased just off the inside from near the rear early on, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, rallied to take
command nearing the eighth pole, drew clear under a drive getting geared down in the late stages. PRINCESS PINKY prompted the pace three then two
wide taking over command at the three-eighths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole before being set down spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under threat and was collared nearing the eighth pole, kept on clear for the place honors. MAKE OR BREAK chased three to four wide under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, weakened while well clear for the show honors. JASMINESQUE chased four wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, tired in the drive. BEHIND THE COUCH three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three
furlongs from home, spun four wide into upper stretch and tired. MAMA KIN established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside under some
pressure to the outside through the presence of PRINCESS PINKY, tucked inside half a mile from home, yielded the front at the three-eighths and faded,
cut the corner into upper stretch, folded and was eased through the final furlong. Please note that due to a winter weather safety initiative all riders carried
an additional two pounds.

Footnotes
WRITER'S REGRET maintained the advantage after narrowly out-breaking the competition, went onto the two path, was held in reserve showing the way,
attended by SKIPPINGANDAJUMPIN from along the inside route, kicked away from others during the final stages of the run around the bend, doing so
under his own power, got let a notch in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, scampered away to a comfortable advantage during the next furlong,
squandered some of that lead the final sixteenth having been geared down. SCOTTO made contact with in addition to taking TAPITENA along for an
abbreviated ride after coming in slightly himself at the start, made it into the two path by the top of the turn, fanned out six wide from upper to midstretch,
gained ground belated on the eased up winner. OUT OF TUNE sat forwardly placed threee wide, got called upon at the five-sixteenths marker, swung into
the stretch and was outfinished. IN THE ZONE tracked the pace from along the inside route, got worked towards path five entering the stretch, shifted in late
while making no headway. SKIPPINGANDAJUMPIN spotted along the rail, vied with the winner for command for nearly a half before faltering.
BEATTHATFLEW took up the chase from the two path, got sent out four wide from upper to midstrech, made up no real estate. TAPITENA nudged inward
being bumped by SCOTTO at the start, departed the backstretch from the three path, went five wide exiting it, had no rally. VICE KING quickly placed along
the rail, went on to save ground to no avail. SOPHOS chased the pace from the two path, never got involved. All riders carried an additional two pounds in
compliance with a weather-related safety initiative.

CAUSE OF ACTION chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying
to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command seventy yards from home, then inched away to the finish to prevail. TAPIZEARANCE five
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide and advanced to press the leader between foes among a quartet latched on, took over
command at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat and was caught seventy
yards out, ran on clear of the rest for the place honors. BEACH FRONT hustled from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. LARCENY chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. PINKY DUDE established the front and showed the way in
hand just off the inside, tucked inside and came under pressure from a trio, yielded the front five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. QUEEN'S MASON hustled from the gate, prompted the pace four then three wide down the backstretch, tucked to
the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and weakened. BIG'S GRAY DAY lunged at the break,
chased five then four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled in and spun just off the inside for home and weakened. ALONGCAMETHEPRINCE

Footnotes
CROWDED TRADE gathered after coming in springing from the starting gate, was towards path two steadily advancing towards the front runners, angled
five wide for the best of racing room coming into the stretch, kicked in stride, closed the gap readily leaving the eighth pole, struck the front end in the final
seventy yards and edged clear. HYPERACTIVE CHRIS pressed the issue two to three wide, took over the advantage late on the bend, was more in the
three path getting driven into the stretch, drew out to its largest advantage by the beginning of the final furlong, saw the winner gain ground rapidly,
relinquished well inside the sixteenth marker, had no trouble at all salvaging second. LEMON DROP ROAD shifted to the inside on the backstretch, pursued
the pace three to four wide on the turn, got steered into path five for the drive home, finished well enough down the center of the strip to be along for the
show. BIRD RULER inward after losing his footing at the start, sat forwardly placed three wide, was under a drive commencing the stretch one path farther
off the rail, gave way. RANGER FOX disputed the pace kept a slight distance from off the rail for the opening half, faltered. MOONSHININGBRIGHT loosely
drafted behind RANGER FOX from the top of the bend until near its end, tipped out two wide for the stretch run, backed away. FROSTED INDIAN squeezed
in the shadow of the gate, cut over to the rail, rode it until the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, was in the two path by the head of the stretch, failed to fire.
RUDY ROD reluctant to load, got bumped shortly after the field had been sent off and running, entered the turn two wide displaying no speed, moved out
several paths wider into the lane, then ventured onward with little speed. All riders carried an additional two pounds in compliance with a weather-related
safety initiative.

Footnotes
ROCCO STRONG set up in the pocket early on the backstretch, patiently kept an eye on the pacesetter, slid towards path two stepping onto the top of the
lane, responded when given his cue, wore down BLU GROTTO with approximately a sixteenth to go and drew clear in smart fashion. SONO GRATO rode
the rail for nearly three-quarters, got maneuvered to the outside for the stretch run, settled towards path four when done, proved no match for the winner
while rallying for second. BLU GROTTO established the top, got guided to the inside, showed the way, spaced at a slight distance from off the rail, got set
down for the drive, relinquished in the general area of the sixteenth pole, weakened into the show slot. ASK NEAL two to three wide, was under a drive
racing on the turn, went into the stretch, made no headway. SINASHACK tracked the pace towards the inside route, was asked for more springing from the
five-sixteenths pole, lacked an offering and backed away. NERVES OF STEEL strung out three wide on the turn, folded. WE READY taken hold after
ducking in at the start, sat parked out four wide on the turn, swung out six wide into the lane while starting to retreat. MISCHIEVOUS JUAN rode the rail for
most of the journey leading up to the quarter pole, shifted into the three path early during the stretch drive, came up empty. All riders carried an additional
two pounds in compliance with a weather-related safety initiative.

Footnotes
I LOVE JAXSON six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four to five wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six
wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong tussling with CHIEF KNOW IT ALL and taking command a sixteenth from home,
then inched away to the finish. CHIEF KNOW IT ALL five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, went five wide for home,
took over command at the three-sixteenths dug in under threat through the final furlong getting headed a sixteenth out, ran on to be along clear of the rest
and second best. HAMMERIN AAMER got bumped at the start by HOORAY FOR HARVEY, who broke outwards, then lost his lane to rivals, chased four to
five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn and came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into
upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. MAC'S REVOLUTION prompted the pace four then three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened. HOORAY FOR HARVEY broke out at the start bumping HAMMERIN AAMER, chased just
off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. FLATEXCEL established the front and showed the way
in hand three then two wide under some pressure from MAC'S REVOLUTION to the outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside for home under threat, yielded the front near the three-sixteenths and tired. SCARF IT DOWN seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, went
five wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered six to seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. ZITMAN chased three
wide down the backstretch before tucking inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch
and tired. Please note that due to a winter weather safety initiative all riders carried an additional two pounds.
