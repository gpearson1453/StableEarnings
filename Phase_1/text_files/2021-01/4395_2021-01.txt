Footnotes
DIMERA set a pressured early pace, went three wide into the turn, kept on through the stretch, drifted slightly and held. KING LEBRON tracked the early
pace, went five wide into the turn, was gaining late and finished second best. BUMBLEBEE pressed the early pace, went four wide into the turn and
weakened late. STRIKE A STORM stalked the early pace from the inside and offered a mild late rally. ASTRO CAT was not far back early, raced between
rivals into the turn and offered some late gain. THIRTY SECONDS OUT was allowed to settle early, went five wide into the turn and finished belatedly.
AUTISMONEFORTYFIVE was void of any speed, raced along the inside and never fired. SOUND LOGIC was unhurried early, went three wide and was no
threat. MAGIC JOURNEY was taken back early, went seven wide and was no factor. DRINKIN FIRE WATER raced in mid pack early, went six wide into the
turn and gave way. AN OBJECTION WAS CALLED ON THE WINNER BY THE SECOND PLACE RIDER BUT THE STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.
