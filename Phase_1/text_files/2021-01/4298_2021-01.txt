Footnotes
DISCRETIONARY DAY took control early, set the pace to the far turn, met bids from outside into the stretch and kicked clear once again under right-handed
urging and strong handling in the final sixteenth. BIG TALKER off slow to begin, unhurried through the early stages, swung out leaving the far tur and bid
four deep, could not match the winner late but got up for the place. BIG FLINT put in tight quarters and checked between rivals soon after the start, went two
wide around the first turn then moved a bit further off the rail, bid three deep exiting the final turn and got edged for the place. BLUE STAR raced off the
pace early and settled inside, came out in upper stretch and showed a mild response late. CIRCLEOFCHAMPIONS closest in pursuit of the leader, bid
between foes at the quarter pole and into the stretch then weakened. WHISKEY VISION stalked the the leader from inside to the stretch and also
weakened. PEDRO PEREZ stalked outside a rival or two wide to the lane and faded in the drive. BROCHACHO off slow to begin and took a bit to settled
into the stride, angled to the inside and remained along the fence into the stretch and was never a factor. THE HENRIETTA saved ground through both
turns and tired.

Footnotes
VANGOGO sped clear early, showed the way in the two path through the turn and remained clear to the wire. FULL ECLIPSE stalked the speed from
inside, tipped out in upper stretch and gained ground late. PASITO raced along the rail then moved out into the two path around the turn, shifted out into the
stretch and showed late effort in the final furlong to close the gap. ENRICHED BY DEB chased outside the leader, angled in to the rail on the turn and went
evenly in the drive. HAPPY TRAILS trailed the field early, went three to four wide around the bend and passed tired rivals. PLUM WILD settled off the inside,
took the turn three wide and never responded when asked. YOU WANNA EAR RIP tracked two wide or outside a rival, entered the stretch three wide then
came in a bit in upper stretch and had little left.

Footnotes
MORAZ stalked the top pair to the far turn, closed in around the bend, cleared both rivals past the five-sixteenths pole and powered away in the lane.
PEACHTREE ROAD drifted in and bothered foes early, tracked outside a pair of rivals, advanced three wide around the turn then two wide into the drive,
could not make a dent in the winners margin but secured the place. A REAL HERO bumped from the outside early, chased inside a pair of rivals then
angled three wide into the lane and kept on willingly through the stretch. WHISTLER'S STYLE forced in, bumped and checked soon after the start, angled in
on the first turn, settled off the pace then angled out into the lane and improved position. AGREETODISAGREE bumped both sides and checked early,
traveled three wide into the lane, moved out further at the top of the stretch and could not rally. SWEETEST ANGEL dueled for the lead from inside, inched
ahead from rival nearing the half-mile pole, held a short lead into the far turn then was overtaken past the five-sixteenths pole, chased the winner into the
lane and gave way. LUNATIC dueled from outside, pressed to the far turn, chased the winner leaving the second bend and tired. I'M ALL THE JEDI
squeezed between rivals and checked early, trailed well behind the field, went two wide into the drive, eased in the stretch and walked off. THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED PEACHTREE ROAD FROM SECOND TO LAST FOR DRIFTING IN EARLY AND CAUSING A CHAIN REACTION BETWEEN
WHISTLER'S STYLE, I'M ALL THE JEDI, AND AGREETODISAGREE SOON AFTER THE START.

Footnotes
MAC DADDY TOO stalked outside a pair of rivals then bid three deep into the turn, put a head in front at the five-sixteenths pole, cleared into stretch,
challenged from outside in the final sixteenth, drifted out under left-handed urging and prevailed. GATOR SHINING pinballed and steadied at the start,
allowed to settle at the back, traveled three to four wide around the turn, rallied and drew alongside the leader in deep stretch, was floated out a bit and
could not get by. WINDY CITY RED bumped hard leaving the gate, sat off the pace and angled to the inside, angled out in the stretch and summoned a mild
rally. CROSSWORD broke out and bumped both sides at the start, saved ground around the turn, lacked room and steadied in upper stretch and could not
regain momentum. TETON VALLEY stumbled leaving the gate, recovered quickly and went up to take command, set the pace with company to the outside,
vied with a pair of rivals around the turn and folded in the lane. SUPERMAN SHAQ broke in and bumped rival, chased off the rail then between foes, went
three wide into the lane and weakened. MINSKY (IRE) pressed the pace from outside, vied for the lead between rivals around the turn then gave way.

Footnotes
BORDER TOWN off a bit slow to begin and steered to the inside while content to sit off the pace, angled out around the far turn and came five wide into the
drive, rallied and reeled in the runner-up in the closing moments. AWARD WINNER sped clear and angled to the inside, remained unchallenged to the
stretch, urged right-handed in upper stretch then switch to the left-hand inside the furlong grounds and was caught by the winner. SALVATOR MUNDI
stalked from inside then three wide into the lane, rallied between the top pair late but was enough. MURAD KHAN (FR) stalked the pace along the fence,
saved ground to the stretch and finished evenly. OUR SILVER OAK raced two wide around the clubhouse turn, remained in the two path into the far turn,
swung out and exited that bend five wide and summoned a mild rally. KAZAN (IRE) tucked inside on the first turn while trailing the field, came out into the
stretch and passed tired rivals. FIVESTAR LYNCH (IRE) up close behind the leader just off the rail, coaxed around the far turn but weakened in the drive.
LYMEBYRD in range while in the two path, angled out around the far turn and faded. KING THEO went two to three wide around the first turn, traveled in
mid-pack through the backstretch, entered the stretch two wide and came up empty.

Footnotes
PUBILIUS SYRUS raced four wide into the first turn while being asked then angled in a bit, steered to the rail entering the far turn, angled out around that
bend, rallied drew alongside the runner-up at the sixteenth pole and proved best late. ZESTFUL away quickly from inside, led through the first turn then lost
the lead on the backstretch while dueling with outside rival, put a head in front at the three-eighths pole, cleared into the stretch and was caught by the
winner at the sixteenth pole and could not match that one late. SYNTHESIS chased three wide around the first turn then went up to duel outside a rival and
took a slim advantage, lost the lead nearing the three-eighths pole, fought back around the final turn, could not keep pace in the lane but churned on to hold
the show. TRUTH SEEKER raced off the pace, angled out on the second turn, came four wide into the lane and missed the show. HEARTFULLOFSTARS
went four to five wide around the first turn, traveled near the back of the pace off the inside, stayed off the rail to the far turn then angled out and exited the
bend five to six wide and failed to threaten. UNBROKEN STAR bobbled at the start, took the first turn three to four wide, chased outside the top pair four
then three wide through the last turn and weakened. TOBACCO ROAD chased two wide around the clubhouse turn, stayed close and angled in on the
second turn and tired.

Footnotes
FLY TO MARS up close stalking the pacesetter, bid outside rival at the quarter pole, over took foe in upper stretch, kicked clear at the eighth pole and drew
away. SOUTHERN KING stalked off the inside, two to three wide into the stretch, could not threaten the winner late but gained the place. FORAY set the
pace along the inside, lost command in upper stretch and kept on to secure the show. MOVE OVER (GB) went three to four wide around the first turn,
traveled mid-pack up the backstretch, traveled three to four wide around the last turn and never produced the needed bid. OF GOOD REPORT in range of
the leader from inside, cut the corner into the stretch, lacked room and steadied at the eighth pole then kept on to the wire. NEW YEAR raced off the pace
along the fence, moved out into the two path around the far turn, tipped out in the drive and never threatened. SLY tracked two wide then between foes past
the half-mile pole, asked in the drive and gave no response. DR. TROUTMAN broke out and bumped rival, pulled and shifted out prior to the first turn, went
three wide into the lane and lacked further response. WORTHY TURK bumped by inside rival leaving the gate, forced out by that same foe nearing the first
turn, angled in around the bend, stayed inside and saved ground to the stretch and proved no menace. CAMINO DE ESTRELLA took the first turn five wide,
remained widest up the backstretch, entered the far turn five wide then angled into the three path and weakened.
