Footnotes
SHIP STALKER broke in and bumped foe at the start then stalked pace from the inside then took command at the head of the stretch to be much the best.
BLUE BOMBER pressed the pace throughout while dueling with the leader from the two path and was able to hold on to place. HATTIES JEWEL set the
pace early while dueling with foes and was able to hold onto the show. MAGIC VOW was bumped at the start and raced in mid pack throughout. MOMENT
broke out slightly and bumped foe made a bid on the back stretch but hung. THAT'S D 'CAT was not a threat. NASTIDA MAST was not a factor.
