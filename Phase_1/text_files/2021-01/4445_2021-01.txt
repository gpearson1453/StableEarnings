KINCAID PARK broke alertly, set the pace saving ground, turned back both BIGFOOT CITY and HYPERSONIC at the five sixteenths, pushed away to mid
stretch and held driving. BIGFOOT CITY pressed the winner from the three path, offered a bid mid way on the turn but was outkicked then battled
HYPERSONIC through a long drive and got the nod for second. HYPERSONIC stalked the top two while off the rail, was also outkicked by the winner to mid
stretch then fought but got nipped for the place. AGENT ZERO had no speed, raced two then three wide to the stretch but failed to mount a serious threat.
DARKHAWK trailed to the turn, came three wide to the stretch and also was not a threat. IDIOT IN LOVE was chasing from the rail to the turn then saved
ground but gave out in the drive.

OMPH was well placed off the leader to the second turn, bid three wide to take the lead into the stretch then held under steady urging. SOONER THAN
SOONER chased the pace to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then chased the winner home. SLEEP OVER set the pace for five
furlongs, was collared on the second turn then got outrun to mid stretch and weakened. TIGER ON THE PROWL was four wide to the backstretch, settled to
the second turn, tried to rally three deep but came up empty. YNOT TONY had no speed and was never a threat.

EXHORTATION was chasing the leaders, raced two wide to the stretch then shifted out, responded when set down and closed determinedly to be along in
time. UNUSUAL MISCHIEF pressed the pace two wide to the stretch, rallied to get on terms in mid stretch, battled willingly but was caught and outfinished
by the winner. TIZ A SPEED BOMB set a pressured pace from the rail to the stretch, was collared by UNUSUAL MISCHIEF in mid stretch but would not late
that one by, gamely dug in to deep stretch and only gave way in the final thirty yards. COOLCROSS had no speed, saved ground to the stretch but lacked
the needed late response. SHARP WARNING was also chasing the leaders, came two wide to the stretch and also did not rally. HULA KING broke slow,
had no speed and was never a factor.

CLAIM OF PASSION never far back to the second turn, rallied four then five wide to the stretch then took out after SHADRACK once straightened away and
closed determinedly to get the nod. SHADRACK was unhurried early, raced in traffic at the half mile pole, circled five wide on the second turn, rallied to the
front, dug in stubbornly in the late stages and just missed. ON RAGLAN ROAD settled mid pack to the half, rallied three wide to engage for the lead on the
second turn, got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. DESCARTES took back off heels into the first turn, chased the pace to the second turn, bid three
wide to the stretch but was tiring in the drive. SACRED RIDER bobbled to begin and had no speed, raced well back to the far turn then was forced out six
wide to the stretch and could not make an impace in the drive. FOOTHILL had no speed and was never a threat. READY SAY GO was four wide to the
backstretch, pushed up to loom a threat four wide on the second turn but was outrun in upper stretch and tired. RIVER ROSE pressed the pace to the
second turn then was very wide and gave way. PAPAPIFAS hustled to the front, set the pace for a half mile while two wide but gave way after six furlongs.
