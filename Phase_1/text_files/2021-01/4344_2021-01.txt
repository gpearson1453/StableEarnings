FLASH OF GLORY stalked the early pace, angled out six wide through the second turn, was gaining late, took control late and held for the win. SOUTHERN
SUMMER was outrun early, angled out four wide through the second turn, was closing late and finished second best. MARQUE IT UP set a pressured early
pace, raced off the rail and weakened. GREY POINT pressed the early pace, raced between rivals into the home turn and faded. SAILING FOR HOME was
void of any speed, raced along the inside and offered no late rally. SUPER MOTION tracked the early pace, raced six wide into the second turn and was
empty late.

Footnotes
LAUGHAROO set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, opened up in late stretch and edged clear for the win. JAZZY EINSTEIN was
unhurried early, went six wide into the turn, angled in late, was no match and finished second best. FRIENDSWITHBOURBON pressed the early pace, went
four wide into the turn and weakened late. TSURUOKA was allowed to settle early, went five wide into the turn and was empty. SUCCESFUL SKY raced in
mid pack, raced between rivals and faded. ESCAPABULL was void of speed and was no factor.
