sixteenth. GOLD TIME VIXEN broke slowly, lagged early, swung wide into the stretch and finished with good energy. MPEMBA was bumped nearing the
end of the backstretch while not far back along the rail, came out three wide for room nearing the stretch, bid outside rivals into the final furlong then
weakened. GRAY LOLLIPOPS showed speed between rivals, moved two wide to a short lead midway on the turn, remained in control into the final furlong
then tired. TIPSY CHATTER made the pace along the rail into the turn, remained prominent into the final furlong then tired. MARTHA'S MISCHIEF showed
speed three wide into the turn then stopped. LUCKY DAY DIVA wasn't far back early, lugged into MPEMBA nearing the end of the backstretch, was finished

into the far turn, came out three wide midway on that turn, loomed boldly outside through the lane and gained slowly. BLOW THE WHISTLE pressed two

the stretch then passed tired ones. FED FEVER ducked out into KRACHENWAGEN leaving the gate, had position three wide for over six furlongs then

Footnotes
WIRETAP was never far back, moved two wide to command midway on the turn, drew clear in early stretch and widened under urging. PERFECTA STORM
was slow early, stayed inside while rallying into the stretch, angled out and gained mildly. GABBY'SGOLDENVOICE raced wide around the turn and lacked
a rally. HAVANA LASS opened a clear lead from the inside midway on the backstretch and was finished after a half. ALLEYESFOLLOWBELLE was no
factor. CHANTAJE angled to the inside nearing the turn then stopped. SUMMER SWEETHEART was outrun. SLIP SLIDIN had early position outside,
lugged in nearing the turn, took to the outside and was eased up.

INHONOROFTHEMOON rallied the two path around the turn, took over from between horses leaving the furlong grounds, was brushed repeatedly through
late stretch and held. DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT rallied the three path outside the winner around the turn, lugged in under right hand whip, brushed that one
repeatedly through late stretch and wasn't enough. IMPETUOUS was pinched between horses leaving the gate, was sent clear soon after, stayed close to
the rail while making the pace into the final furlong then weakened. A MAIZE ZING RIP raced the three path and lacked a rally. LEGAL GUMP trailed.
