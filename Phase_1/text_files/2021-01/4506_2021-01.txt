Footnotes
MADDIE'S MOJITO away quickest from the gate then was rated outside the leader, applied pressure into the turn, headed rival at the three-eighths, took
over shortly after and cleared at the five-sixteenths pole, urged right-handed in the lane and padded the margin in the late stages. ENSLEYS DREAM
chased outside the top pair up the backstretch, went four then three wide around the turn, urged around the bend but lacked the necessary bid and stayed
on for the place. JEANNE B lacked early speed, angled in nearing the turn, saved ground along the inside then tipped out at the top of the lane and was
along for the show. OUR LITTLE TIGER chased two then three wide around turn and weakened. FEELING FLUSH raced off the pace and moved to the rail,
shifted to the two path around the bend, came out at the top of the stretch and proved no menace. BOSSY MAMA set the pace near the inside, challenged
by rival at the three-eighths pole, could not offer the needed response to kick on with the winner, dropped back around the turn, was eased late and walked
off.

LADY ON ICE pinballed between rivals at the start, chased the top pair two wide into the turn, angled out leaving the bend, came four wide into the stretch,
bid four deep then dueled with CANADIAN GINGER in the late stages and edged the runner-up. CANADIAN GINGER broke out and bumped rival, chased
along the inside, waited for room past the halfway point on the turn and into the stretch, bid between rivals in upper stretch, grabbed the lead at the eighth
pole, dueled with LADY ON ICE in the final furlong and got outkicked in the closing moments. TIZ TOFFEE dueled for the lead from inside into and around
the turn, vied with a trio of rivals to the eighth pole, weakened in the final furlong but held the show. SHERILINDA dueled for the lead outside TIZ TOFFEE,
vied three deep in upper stretch and weakened inside the furlong grounds. SEA GLASS bumped twice leaving the gate, trailed the field three then two wide
around the turn and never made an impact.

Footnotes
K P D DAY stalked from inside then angled outside the leader on the backstretch, applied pressure then dueled past the halfway, took the lead at the
quarter pole and cleared rival at the top of the lane and held safely in the late stages. FULL DRAW was fanned six wide into the first turn then angled down
to the two path, went up to get in range on the backstretch, chased three wide into the stretch, could not summon the needed late kick but was clearly
second best. TWIRLING DERBY went four wide around the first turn, chased outside a rival then three wide into the drive and was along for third. LUCKY
RYAN SEVEN sped clear in the two path, pressured from outside and dueled with K P D DAY into and around the far turn, then weakened in the lane.
MONGOL ALTAI was fanned five wide around the first turn, tracked widest then angled into the three path nearing the far turn, shifted to the two path
around that bend and weakened. LANDAA settled along the inside, saved ground to the stretch and proved no menace. BIG BILLY tracked the pace off the
rail, coaxed along up the backstretch, had little left around the far turn, was eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
THIS TEA bumped from inside at the start, was well placed behind the top quartet early, came out on the final turn and bid five then four wide leaving the
turn, led into the stretch, kicked clear and shifted inward inside the sixteenth pole while staying strong to the wire. SHEZAGHOST pressed the pace from
outside, went up to vie for command between foes, led into the far turn, battled around that bend and into the stretch, could not match the winner but held

Footnotes
SABUDA stalked the leader from outside, bid alongside at the three-eighths pole, gained command at the quarter pole, cleared rival and drew off while
drifting out in the lane. THELUTEISMINE broke out and bumped at the start, set the pace in the two path into the turn, dueled with rival around the bend,
could not go on with the winner in the stretch but was clearly second best. CRASH CORRIGAN tracked the pace along the inside to the turn, moved out into
the two path around the bend and bested the rest. THE ROAN RANGER knocked into rival at the start, chased between foes then two wide around the turn,
weakened but was able to churn on for a minor award. STONE'S RIVER chased outside a rival early then checked at the five-eighths pole, went two then
three wide around the turn and lacked a rally. J T'S WATCH tracked three wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SEAHAWK
CODY drifted out and bumped rival into the turn, chased two wide to the stretch and lacked a response when asked. CARELESS KITTEN stalked outside a
rival, four to five wide around the turn and never made an impact. ROBIN'S LEGACY stalked the pace up the backstretch and steered to the inside, saved
ground to the lane and faded. COUSIN EDDIE raced outside a rival then got bumped by that foes into the turn, came four wide into the stretch and had little
left. LITTLE MISCHIEF bumped hard and almost lost the rider at the start, was able to regain his right iron soon after, steadied off heels past the five-eighths
pole, steered out into the clear, went four wide into the turn then angled to the rail around the bend and was empty in the lane.
