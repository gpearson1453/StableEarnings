Footnotes
HYBRID ECLIPSE didn't run off after breaking open gate, got re-mounted, proceeded to come away without apparent mishap, cut over to the rail, went at it
against a pair of opponents from the outside for a spell and then afterwards one on one with NEEDACARCALLLOUIE, got turned loose stepping onto the
head of the stretch with an equally-revved up TEKILA having taken over the role of primary pursuer, staved that foe then steadily kicked clear in the final
furlong. TEKILA maintained a prominent position on the backstretch after contending for the top during the opening phases, departed it from the three path,
moved up increasing her presence as the half was being completed, shifted closer to the rail, was in two path under a ride challenging in earnest heading
home, got turned back, had enough left in the last eighth though to save second. MARACUJA gathered after losing her footing springing from the gate,
pursued the pace from path two, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, chipped away at the deficit late, fell short of snagging away the show.
HANDLE THE TRUTH well held by the assistant starter, didn't run off after popping open the gate, raced at a considerable from off the inside throughout,
was spotted in path five at the top of the turn, flashed some interest as the second fraction was being finalized, went into the stretch and soon fizzled out.
RICELLE taken hold after coming in with her initial start, got guided over to the rail, was on hold awaiting options late on the turn, stepped into the lane and
failed to fire appreciably. AFTER THE WIRE strung out four wide for most of the way on the turn, swung as wide into the stretch, gave way.
NEEDACARCALLLOUIE sparred from outside the winner for the opening half, folded. All riders carried an additional two pounds in accordance with a
weather-related safety initiative.

Footnotes
DARK STORM five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge
through the final furlong taking command nearing the sixteenth pole, then inched away to the finish kept to task. SUPREME AURA two to three wide in
pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. ITS ALL RELEVANT led early on before
conceding the front six and a half furlongs out to his barn mate, raced four then three wide in closest aim of that rival coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, advanced to take over command near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat inside the final
furlong, got collared near the sixteenth marker and kept on to preserve the show honors. RUNABOUT six then five wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the
three-eighths, went five wide for home and improved position to the finish. I LOVE JAXSON chased two to three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out,
swung four wide for home, tipped out at the three-sixteenths four to five paths to the center of the course and offered no response. ATTENTIVE chased four
wide throughout under coaxing from the three-eighths and weakened in the stretch. DIRECT ORDER chased three to four wide under a ride from the
seven-sixteenths and made no impact. GIO D'ORO just off the inside in close aim of the front early on, advanced to take over six and a half furlongs from
home and showed the way in hand tucking to the inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing just past the three-eighths as his barn mate advanced
outside, yielded the front near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch at that station, then faltered in the drive. Please note all riders
carried an additional two pounds due to a winter weather safety initiative.

Footnotes
MR. BUFF away alertly, remained forwardly placed, was patiently ridden stalking MUSICAL HEART towards the two path, a bit too far back to apply any
serious pressure for the opening half, whittled away at the deficit after it had been rattled off, was in hand bidding when ready midpoint on the far turn,
gained control soon afterwards, got set down heading onto the top of the lane, lengthened away, by now stationed in path three, before being geared down
in the final seventy yards. TENDERFOOT took up the chase two to three wide, angled four wide into the stretch, proved no match en route for second.
MUSICAL HEART hustled from the gate to establish the top, was switched over to lighter handling after having achieved the goal, set the first two splits on a
loosely-contested advantage, saw MR. BUFF range up after leaving the backstretch, was powerless to turn back that foe's confident bid midway on turn
two, cut the corner already under a drive, backed away. BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON unhurried travelling two wide early, dove over to the inside route at the
half mile pole, left the three-eighths marker having been put to a brisk hand ride, tipped back into the two path for the commencement of the stretch turn,
failed to fire. FAME TO FAMOUS quickly spotted along the rail, rode it until the quarter pole, failed to pick up interest when asked on the backstretch, got
sent out four wide entering the stretch, had no offering. All riders carried an additional two pounds in accordance with a weather-related safely initiative.

Footnotes
BUSTINMYGROOVE four paths off the inside in range of the leader, tucked to the two path and advanced between foes through the turn to take over
command nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, got shaken up a bit at the three-sixteenths, drew clear under a light drive to the finish.
BIG TONY'S GIRL broke out at the start, chased five paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the
turn and advanced on the front, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide for home, proved no match for the top one while running on to
preserve the place honors. SCOTT ALAIA brushed the near side stall at the start, chased four wide to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung
six to seven wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly offering up a mild kick to miss for the place honors. FLIRTACIOUS KISS five paths off the inside
down the backstretch, went three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, offered up a mild bid, then
weakened in the late stages. AVID SUCINORI hustled from the gate, established the front and showed the way in hand three then two wide down the
backstretch, tucked inside through the turn coming under pressure from a pair and was placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front near the
quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. HARLEM DANCER hustled from the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and made no impact. THE GREAT POOHDINI chased four wide down the backstretch and then just off the
inside through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired. WINTER WARRIOR six paths off the inside in pursuit from
just off the pace, went four wide through the turn, came under coaxing three furlongs out, cornered four wide into upper stretch and folded. EDGE OF
ANXIETY chased five wide briefly before growing rank and green when taken in hand off the heels of a rival and tossed his head seemingly unpleased at
the kickback when guided outside getting out briefly to the seven path before tucking back once more five wide, got out half a mile from home into the turn
with a stiff left side grip applied and went six wide through that bend growing detached at the tail of the field, continued six wide into upper stretch and was
eased to the finish being allowed to complete the course under his own power. Please note that due to a winter weather safety initiative all rider carried an
additional two pounds.

Footnotes
ADVANCED STRATEGY towards the back of the pack in the early going, departed the backstretch from path four, became part of the pace scenario shortly
afterwards, gut cued up challenging in the three path turning onto the head of the stretch, appeared to poke a head down in front after finishing off the run
through the furlong grounds, battled onward against a very determined TOO EARLY the entire last eighth and gamely prevailed. TOO EARLY settled into
the three path prior to arriving at the half mile pole, contended for the top as one of a quartet for much of the run around the bend, narrowly struck the front
as six furlongs was being reeled off, vied with vigour down the stretch with the winner, was determined to the end but wound up denied. KAZ'S BEACH took
up residence after appearing to get away in good order, got let out a notch in the form of some hand encouragement after going a half, tipped into the two
path, was forced to idle along the front runners beginning a sixteenth or so down the road, angled to the outside, eventually getting driven four wide into the
stretch, narrowed in during the ensuing furlong, made no discernable gain thereafter and instead hung. NOTORIOUS FLIRT remained stationed in the two
path, was already under a drive prior to reaching the five-sixteenths pole, got steered out five wide for the stretch run, mustered up the mildest of kicks.
FARRAGUT cut over to the inside early on the backstretch after having established the top, was forced to fend off a threesome of opponents for the majority
of the trip on the bend, wasn't up to the task at hand, relinquishing right near the quarter pole, retreated in the stretch. RIFT VALLEY prompted the pace
from path two, going about the task from between rival on the turn, was through after going six furlongs. FOREVER WICKED parked out five wide and under
a drive by the three-eighths pole, went one path farther off the rail into the stretch, backed away. All riders carried an additional two pounds in accordance
with a weather-related safety initiative.

GUN HILL GIRL six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn advanced through the latter portion of the bend to take
command before swinging four wide into upper stretch, edged away under a drive drifting out a furlong from home, got corrected under an off sided stick,
dug in guided inwards late while holding safe to the finish. VIVE LA LIBERTY chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the
two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home, got bumped straightened away into upper stretch by
TREMAYNE and in turn bumped CAPTIVATING CARA, angled in offering up a mild kick to tepidly threaten late while clear for the place honors.
TREMAYNE seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide
into upper stretch, came in straightened away and bumped the aforementioned foe into CAPTIVATING CARA, kept on to procure the show honors well
clear of the rest. WISH FOR MAGIC chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened.
STELLA MARS five paths off the inside in pursuit from just off the pace, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
backed away to last and went six to seven wide into upper stretch, weakened to the finish while passing tired foes. CAPTIVATING CARA prompted the pace
three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, got bumped straightened away by VIVE LA LIBERTY due to
pressure from TREMAYNE coming inwards and tired. FULL OF FIRE showed the way in hand from the two path, tucked inside half a mile from home, came
under coaxing near the quarter pole, yielded the front and spun just off the inside for home, then tired in the stretch. BLEY four then three wide in aim of the

Footnotes
KINGFISH kept watch on the front runners towards the rear of the field while racing two wide, increased his presence after the second fraction had been
finalized, was kept on hold caught in behind some others late on the bend, slithered its way three wide onto the top of the lane, gained some clearance after
going onward for a few more jumps, came in midstretch, resulting in a solid bump with IMPLIED VOLATILITY, kicked into his best, slipped by BETA in the
final seventy yards to take over then edged clear. ROYAL SUSPECT off the inside, pursued the pace four wide on the turn, was in the same path heading
home, closed in on the one to catch, got beat to the top by the winner, stayed on to secure second. BETA patiently ridden keeping watch on the duelers
along the backstretch, crept up towards them after entering the turn, going by as the half was being completed while still in hand, got called upon with a few
strides to spare before the quarter pole, had a pair of closers narrowing in during the last eighth, relinquished to both with under a sixteenth to go. IMPLIED
VOLATILITY took up the chase from the two path, got roused coming up to the five-sixteenths pole, stepped into the stretch, wasn't make any headway
when contact with the winner occurred in midlane. QUINTARELLI unsettled early, underwent a three wide trip on the turn, got sent out into path five from
upper to midstretch, lacked the necessary response. HONORABLE AVENUE rode the rail until the end of the bend, angled three wide heading onto the top
of the lane, made no impact. UNBRIDLED JOHN set up the two path, sparred for command, going about the task from between rivals from the top of the
turn until its midway point, had no answer when BETA took over and steadily backed away. FREEDOM FORCE positioned along the inside, went at it one
on one with UNBRIDLED JOHN during the initial stages before having BETA make it a three-way tussle at the top one, vied onward for the half, faltered. All
riders carried an additional two pounds in accordance with a weather-related safety initiative.

Footnotes
CHESTERTOWN three to four wide through the first turn, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five to six wide into
upper stretch, took over command straightened away, edged clear under a drive coming inwards to the rail inside the final sixteenth. OBSESSED chased
just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and ran on to
secure the place honors. AASR just off the inside through the first turn, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went six wide
into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. LOST IN ROME forwardly placed three wide through the first turn, raced four wide in
aim of the leader before closing in to prompt that rival from the outside with five-eighths to run, increased the pressure through the far turn under coaxing
from the three-eighths and got on near even terms, got floated five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. AMERICAN RULE established the
front and showed the way just off the inside through the first turn before tipping to the three path down the backstretch, had the aforementioned foe latch on
to the outside five furlongs out, tucked to the two path through the far turn getting placed to coaxing under increasing pressure with LOST IN ROME now on
near even terms, floated four wide into upper stretch carrying that rival five wide and the eventual winner to the six path, yielded the front straightened away
and weakened. VILLAINOUS chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, cut the
corner into upper stretch and made no impact. MALIBU STAR raced four wide through the first turn before tipping seven paths off the inside down the
backstretch, came under coaxing at the three-eighths five wide, cornered five to six wide into upper stretch and trailed while not being persevered with to the
finish. Please note that due to a winter weather safety initiative all riders carried an additional two pounds.

Footnotes
WINNING DRIVE worked its way into the three path on the backstretch, momentarily waited behind the front runners late on the bend before having the
rider commit, angled sharply approximately five wide into the stretch, kicked into his best and gained ground readily on IT'S HOT OUT, collared that
opponent with just under an eighth to go, drew clear then had plenty left at the end to fend off the second place finisher. TALE OF MIST guided onto the rail,
slipped to the outside at the five-sixteenths pole, swung out into the three path for the drive, gained ground, altered towards path five nearing the sixteenth
marker, continued onward with some willingness garnering the place. IRISH ROAR (IRE) tracked the pace from just off rail, was more in path two heading
onto the top of the lane, stayed on belatedly for the show. IT'S HOT OUT forwardly placed four wide, got driven into the lane clutching a slim lead, was
reeled in shortly after leaving the eighth pole, then steadily weakened. CORPORATE RAIDER disputed the pace from path two, gave way. SAN JUAN
DIEGO sat marooned along the overland route to no avail. PROFESSOR SNAPE two wide in pursuit of the pace for nearly a half, got sent out into path
seven in the lane, never made its presence felt. HURRICANE DANCER four wide onto the turn, got moved out into path six for the drive, lacked the
necessary response. I SAW IT ALL strung out four wide at the top of the turn, was in path six at the top of the lane, never got involved. WIN WITH PRIDE
underwent a ground-saving journey, steadied briefly after cutting the corner into the stretch and faltered. All riders carried an additional two pounds in
accordance with a weather-related safety initiative.
