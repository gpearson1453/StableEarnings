Footnotes
COWGIRL NIGHT saved ground off the pace the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, took the
lead two deep toward the quarter, moved clear midway on the far turn and drew off the final sixteenth. SIGNATURE DISH accelerated to the front past the
three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the seven sixteenths, gave up the lead approaching the quarter,
dropped back midway on the far turn and settled for second. GREAT CAUSE rated close in the three path, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths
pole and raced at the rail rounding the far turn then ran evenly down the lane. CLASSY ESCORT rated close inside the first turn, picked up the chase
leaving the three eighths pole and passed a rival late. WATERLOO ROSE saved ground the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, offered only a
mild bid, raced in the three path of the far turn and weakened. PACIFIC GOLD stalked the early pace from the three path, challenged toward the seven
sixteenths pole but faded past the three eighths. OH SO JAZZY raced off the pace in the three and four paths and was never a factor.

PRIMAL DESTINY surged to the front on the chute and rated the pace inside, came under pressure into the turn, widened the advantage to the head of the
lane then dug in under steady encouragement and held on well. WIDGET FACTORY chased the leaders inside and raced at the rail on the turn, angled out
in the upper stretch, took over second mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner. TOP HAT TITAN chased the pace and raced close off the rail through the
turn, ceded second mid-stretch but dug in to retain third. BRIAN'S AVENUE chased the pace inside, raced at the rail on the turn then outfinished in the
stretch duel for third. BOUNDTOBEGOOD chased the pace through the backstretch and rounded the turn two deep, eased to the outside in the upper
stretch and finished well; widest. RAPID BEAT was bumped at the break then picked up the chase, rounded the turn about the four path, drifted a bit into the
stretch and raced evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. FIREBIRD saved ground on the turn and showed little in the lane. MR. VECCHIO broke in to
make contact with Rapid Beat, picked up the chase and raced in the four path of the turn, and showed little more.

Footnotes
SPUNMAN settled off the pace in the three path the opening turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then dug
in to take over later yards and was clear at the wire. SHOWTIME CAT stalked the earlier pace two deep and moved to even terms leaving the half mile pole,
took the nod toward the seven sixteenths, raced clear at the three eighths and came under pressure approaching the quarter, rounded the far turn at the rail
but was caught in later yards. HUMPTY GRUMPTY became edgy in the gate and hesitated slightly at the break, settled off the pace inside the first turn,
started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and improved at the rail on the far turn, then finished evenly. MIO BECOMING settled just off the rail the first
turn, started a bid from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail through the far turn then flattened inside the sixteenth. LET'S GET STARTED saved ground
well off the early pace, bid into the backstretch and improved four wide on the far turn, but showed little more. SEATTLE SAILAWAY saved ground off the
pace, showed little response through the backstretch, rounded the far turn about the four path and flattened out. ANOTHER MOVE raced well back.
MINDYOURPSANDQS saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but faded at the rail into the far turn. PRINCE LOUIS
angled to the inside to rate a slim early lead, was met past the half mile pole, gave up the nod toward the seven sixteenths then gave way past the five
sixteenths.

Footnotes
BELLA GIANNA took the lead approaching the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady left handed encouragement while drifting outward from the sixteenth pole, and held on. DEVILISH
BEAUTY stalked the pace just off the rail, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dug in at the head of the lane and took aim mid-stretch but was
forced out through the final sixteenth while gaining on the winner. MABEL saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail
on the far turn, then finished evenly inside. SO RED THE ROSE raced three wide the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid nearing the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn four wide then flattened out inside the sixteenth pole. DUDES PICK settled back off the rail the first turn then eased
out into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, though flattened out the final sixteenth. BUSTIN BUNNY
broke a step slow and rounded the first turn five wide, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn but showed little more. EL A
VADER raced off the pace inside the first turn and showed little response down the backstretch. RUN ON ENERGY rounded the opening turn four wide and
showed little response through the backstretch. TRINNI SUNSET was not a factor. Following a Stewards inquiry and a subsequent claim of foul against the
rider of Bella Gianna, lodged by the rider of Devilish Beauty, the Stewards disqualified the former for interfering with the latter through the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
ITGOT GRANDMA rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and widened through the far turn, then kept alert to the late
going, while taken in hand the final yards. CRAZY IDEA settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced three
wide on the far turn, then dug in to take second later yards. THE WAYNE FACTOR stalked the earlier pace from the two and three paths, picked up the
chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn but flattened stride the final furlong. MY EMINENCE saved early ground while well
off the pace, eased out into the backstretch and bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path then weakened the final sixteenth.
TOP ME OFF saved ground just off the early pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced two deep on the far turn, though showed little further in the
lane. GLAD MOON (GER) stalked the pace inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, but weakened at the rail on the far turn. SAVE ME PAULA
rounded the first turn in the five path and was never a factor. SHOTMASTER rounded the first turn about the four path and was never a factor.

Footnotes
FIRST LADY MAGGIE pressured the pace and took the nod nearing the head of the lane, dueled clear mid-stretch and widened the final sixteenth.
COMFORTABLE CAT chased the pace inside, rounded the turn at the rail. DARK TRICKS set a pressured pace inside, ceded the advantage nearest the
rail approaching the head of the lane, dropped back mid-stretch and flattened the final sixteenth. SWEETONTHEGENTS broke slowly then picked up the
chase toward the inside, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened the final furlong. BARBSGRAY LION chased the pace inside, rounded the turn at the rail,
drifted into the stretch and showed little more. TUESDAY'S ROSE gave distant chase through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn, lost ground
leaving the turn and passed a rival. UNCANNY chased the early pace off the rail then flattened stride about the five path of the turn. NIGHTMARE broke
awkwardly and never factored. WARRIOR EMPRESS raced in the four and five paths on the turn then weakened.

closed to the lead two deep midway on the far turn, dug in to put CAUSE FOR SURPRISE away but yielded to the winner later yards, while the latter of

the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and showed little more. FRANKIE DOTS settled off the pace inside, bid only mildly then
weakened. THREE TO THIRTEEN and GLEN'S CASTLE were not factors.
