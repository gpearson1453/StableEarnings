MR RIGHT NOW stalked the early pace, angled out six wide into the second turn, took control at the eighth pole and drew off as an easy winner. BIG
BARREL set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the home turn, met the bid of the winner, couldn't sustain the run, was no match late and finished
second best. TERRACOTTA SOLDIER was unhurried early, circled nine wide through the second turn and was along for the show position. CAIRO KING
chased the early pace, raced between rivals into the home turn and faded. ARABIAN STORY was up close early, raced seven wide into the second turn and
weakened. MR. MAGICO was taken back early and was never a factor. OUT ON SATURDAY was allowed to settle early, loomed eight wide through the
second turn and flattened out. COURAGEOUS stumbled at the start, was void of any early speed, saved ground and never fired.
