VOLODINA vied outside, took over before half a mile, drew away to a long advantage and stayed safe under moderate urging. HOLA PRINCESS forced out
into the first turn, raced outside and closed the gap while no threat. GALILEO'S AFFAIR lacked speed, saved ground and rallied mildly while no factor. GOBI
dropped back early, offered a mild bid and flattened out in the stretch. CANOOCHEE broke sluggishly and was always far behind. BEACH TAG ducked out
under attempted rating into the first turn then stopped after a brief duel.

Footnotes
PRINCESS PALOMAR stalked the pace, chased on the far turn, bid nearing the quarter pole, took over, drew clear in upper stretch and held on for the win.
IZZADORA BELLA raced four wide early, three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, advanced on the far turn, came wide, rallied late outside, surged
and just missed. PADRINONEVERQUITS set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way into the far turn, dueled with the winner, dug in and stayed
on well to save the show spot. JUMPIN JETT raced five wide early, two wide off the pace, chased on the far turn and lacked a rally. HALLUCINATION was
outrun early, moved up three wide on the far turn and passed tired ones. NOT IN THE MOOD raced six wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace and failed
to threaten. CHANCEE raced off the pace inside and did not factor. ENCHANTABULL raced off the pace inside and gave way. DEEP CANYON stalked in
the early stages, then chased and gave way.

Footnotes
SHOOGER RAY TOO ducked in at the start, settled well behind, circled rivals on the final turn, surged late and won under confident handling. AND SEEK
stalked the pacesetter outside, rallied clear in mid stretch but was outfinished. MITHRA severely bothered from both sides at the start, trailed, was blocked
on the final turn, swung wide and closed well. PERFECT DAYDREAM chased close up, moved inside on the final turn then proved empty in the lane. LIAR
SIDE CHAT took control early from the outside, led for three quarters and faded. BABY BULL ducked out sharply at the start causing crowding and bobbled
soon after then faded inside. GADAGO raced within striking range briefly then weakened steadily. An objection by the rider of MITHRA against the winner
for interference at the start was dismissed.

STARINTHEMAKING vied inside for half a mile, edged clear then widened in the stretch while kept to a drive. TACTICAL PLAN moved outside to challenge
winner after a half, continued well and lasted for the place. ALGORIX settled off the inside, advanced on the final turn then raced evenly late. ACROSS THE
AISLE lacked speed, dropped back then came again with a mild rally. BANKER'S ISLAND raced wide throughout, moved closer on the final turn then faded.
KID MAC COOL was forced to steady along and take up in traffic at the quarter pole. OFFLEE CLOUDY dropped back outside, very wide on the final turn.
PROMISE ILLGETYOU trailed for five furlongs then passed fading rivals. ARRIVEDERCI pressed the leaders inside early then faded after half a mile.
REFUSEING saved ground well off the pace and was never in contention. HIGH FLYING GUY forced the pace outside briefly then stopped abruptly.
LUNAR ROVER raced within striking range early but gave way readily.

rivals and pulled away. GLORY SONG tracked inside, then chased the pace, advanced on the far turn, rallied between rivals at the quarter pole, dug in
gamely but second best. IRISH MEADOW bobbled at the break, was outrun early, advanced inside on the far turn, angled out and rallied mildly for third.
RUNNINGFORHOME raced off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten. POLITY set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way into the far turn,
dueled inside rivals entering the stretch and weakened. STAYNSIDETHECIRCLE was outrun early and did not factor. HIBACHI chased three wide and
faded. PENNSYLVANIA STEEL pulled in the early stages, then stalked between rivals and gave way.

Footnotes
BIRD KING saved ground throughout, bid to front a sixteenth out and edged clear under moderate pressure. CONFESSOR settled close inside, angled out
in the stretch, finished gamely but could not hold off the winner. BROAD STREET BULLY dropped back inside, moved out in the stretch and closed well.
OPTIC WAY set a measured pace inside, led to mid stretch and tired. WISE JUDE lagged far behind racing wide and closed the gap while no threat.
THUNDERSHOOK outrun early, moved out on the final turn and lacked a rally. INFORMATIVE prompted the pace outside for three quarters and gave way.
RUBY BLEU reserved just off the leaders, was asked for run on the final turn but faded. FLAT OUT BEAUTIFUL stumbled badly at the start unseating his
rider. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race.
