Footnotes
RAGGEDY ANNIE forwardly placed from the start, ranged up three wide to challenge late in the turn, shook clear when straightened for home and steadily
increased advantage under steady handling. CATECHISM with the pace early in the two path, dueled through the early part of the turn while remaining off
the inside, briefly raced on equal terms inside that one late in the bend then could not keep up, maintained a clear advantage to the wire for the place.
COLLUDE broke back, lacked speed, came three wide into the lane, proved no match for the top two, well clear of the others. PEEK A BOO I SEE U in the
second flight toward the inside, raced in the two path when moving a bit closer, flattened out in the drive when set down. FLATOYA broke well, set or forced
the pace along the inside, faltered in the drive. KILBARRY LADY settled off the pace and the inside, four wide turning for home when with the second flight,
lacked a rally in the drive. CAPTURE A VICTORY last away, trailed throughout while racing in the two path.

Footnotes
DIXIELAND DREAM prominent from the start outside, shook clear midway in the turn while still in hand, roused past the furlong marker, slowly increased
advantage to the wire under a steady right hand stick. LIL RESPECT settled behind the pace along the inside, crept a bit closer while continuing to save
ground through the turn, could do little with the winner in lacking a closing punch, clear for the place. CRESCENDO BLING within striking distance early
while outside, three wide when moving a bit closer late in the turn, chased the winner upper stretch, drifted out a bit then flattened out. SOUPER CAPACITY
away in good order, forwardly placed inside, two path into the turn, steered out three wide for the drive, went evenly to the wire. FLAMING void of early foot,
lacked a closing response. LAKE SENSE raced back early off the inside, fanned five wide into the lane, made little impact down the lane to finish up evenly.
WILD ESCAPE was never dangerous while racing three wide. DANZIG STAR in mid pack early, four wide turning for home, had little for the drive. DEDE'S
TRICK failed to menace while racing four wide. MYSTICAL MATILDA broke sharp, narrowly showed the way early, dueled with the winner entering the turn,
fell back off that one midway on the bend then gave way in the drive. SAILAWAY AND HIDE off a step slow, remained back throughout to be always outrun.
KLASSY POINT raced toward the front in the second group three wide up the backstretch, stopped in the turn to finish far back.

Footnotes
CASUAL forwardly placed just off the inside, remained in the two path into the lane when advancing, engaged the leader from the outside soon after, kicked
clear while under pressure. LADY ROCKET last to leave while racing in mid pack, roused while off the inside for the drive, shifted out slightly then was up in
the late going to garner the place, no threat to the winner. SARA SEA pressured the early leader from the outside, dueled with that one through the turn in
the two path, showed the way into the stretch, offered brief resistance to the winner then could not keep up the final furlong, weakened then was nipped in
the final stride for the place. CHARMING LADY broke back, failed to menace while saving ground to no avail. RISING SEAS took command after the start,
angled to the inside to show the way into the turn, dueled through the bend, gave way in the drive. SEKANI void of speed, three wide for the drive, failed to
menace. BREAK CURFEW in the second group off the inside, three out to four wide when weakening turning into the stretch, continued to retreat through
the lane and finished far back while remaining well out in the strip.

Footnotes
BEAR OAK vied early into the first turn between horses, edged clear just before a quarter, rated in the run up the backstretch, clear into the lane, responded
when challenged late along the inside, dug in to prevail. DERBY CODE with the winner inside early first turn, fell back and tracked while continuing to save
ground, moved out late, closed the gap inside the furlong grounds, late bid outside, clearly second best. MAJOR KONG behind the pace toward the inside
early, one paced in the run up the backstretch while tracking the first flight, came three wide for the drive, could do little with the top two the final furlong, well
clear of the rest. ALLEN vied early three wide and between rivals, headed up the second flight onto the backstretch, remained within striking distance
through the final turn in the two path, had little left for the drive. FAST RECOVERY void of speed, in the two path through the second turn when improving
position, not a serious threat in the drive. GEORGIA DEPUTY in mid pack off the inside, three out to four wide in the final turn, failed to muster a closing
response when called on for the drive. FOXY ACE void of speed, continued back, picked off some tiring rivals while never a threat. SHAKE IT last away,
trailed well back, also picked off some faltering foes while never a threat. RECKLESSNESS back off the pace, tired while racing in the two path. NIALL had
nothing for the drive. BLANCO BRONCO pressed the issue early from the four path early first turn, stopped in the far bend while getting out.

Footnotes
DEMIGOD away in good order, alternated up front off the inside, held a narrow advantage into the lane, lugged in nearing the furlong marker, straightened,
edging clear late under firm handling. PAPA STAR broke alertly, dueled up front along the inside, briefly held the advantage between calls upper stretch,
headed once again by the winner past the furlong marker, could not match strides with that one late, prevailed for the place. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR stalked
the dueling leaders in the three path, crept a bit closer turning for home, lacked a further response to finish evenly, saved the show. SERBIAN SAILOR off
the pace and the inside, raced four wide through the turn, closest to the top two with a furlong remaining, flattened in the late going to be outkicked for the
show spot. GOOSE ALMIGHTY lacked speed outside, came five wide out of the turn, displayed a modest amount of late interest to be too late for the show.
SLIGHTLY CRAFTY floated out in the early going to bother a couple of outer rivals, settled in mid pack off the inside, three wide into the lane, one paced in
the late going. RANDOM AFFAIR headed up the second flight when chasing the dueling leaders early, began a steady fade through the stretch.
UNBRIDLED SHOES bothered early to race back off the early pace, 2-3w into lane, improved a bit while never a serious threat. ROCK CITY ROCKET away
in good order, raced in the second flight just off the inside, retreated in the run through the stretch. HOSS J W bothered early, remained back while saving
ground to no avail. DIXIE'S HERO void of speed while well wide, always outrun. CHIKI BOY off slow, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BEAVER HAT unhurried while saving ground, crept closer along the rail into the far turn, boxed in early far turn, patiently handled into the lane, bid, floated
out late, edging away late. CLAYTNTHELIONHEART settled off the pace and the inside, in some traffic then was fanned five wide into the lane, late run for
the place. ATOKA cleared toward the inside into the first turn, set the pace while in hand, shook clear into the lane, continued to show the way past the
furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to the winner until late, caught late for the place spot. EXCESSION void of speed for six furlongs, advanced,
steadied behind a wall of horses then altered course to the outside turning for home, improved position with some belated interest outside. MONEY FOR
MISCHIEF lacked early foot, saved some ground when improving into the stretch, flattened out in the late going. TOTALLY JIMBO forwardly placed
between foes past the wire the first time, bumped, bothered and carried out into the first turn, remained forward for five furlongs then began to weaken.
ALEX JOON settled off the pace toward the inside early, three wide far turn, in some traffic and four wide turning for home, failed to muster a rally.
SUBSTANTIAL came out to bother outer rivals when forwardly placed in to the first turn, chased the leader the middle half then faltered in the drive.
GUIDED MISSILE forwardly placed early outside, bothered slightly when floated out to be four wide into the first turn, was giving way when in tight turning
for home, continued to back up through the stretch.

Footnotes
THE SOUND broke out to bother an outer foe, cleared early toward the inside, a bit keen when showing the way onto the backstretch, continued to set the
pace into and through the final bend, brushed when being challenged past the furlong marker, headed late, battled back to gain the nod at the wire. MO
MOSA settled off the pace and the inside, advanced three wide into lane, drifted in when challenging a furlong out, brushed with the winner, led late, missed
the nod at the wire. WARRIOR'S MAP closest to the winner while off the inside, moved closer turning for home while between the top two, lacked a further
advance, narrowly saved the show. DEAN MARTINI settled off the pace and the inside, moved closer to the winner late in the final turn, raced between the
top two into the lane, lacked a further advance to be outkickied for the show spot while along the inside late. MURALIST last away, raced back, angled out
to be five wide turning into the stretch, improved past the furlong marker then flattened out late. MAKE NOISE went one paced throughout in lacking a rally.
WHAT A COUNTRY void of speed, came four wide out of the final turn, failed to muster a closing response. GREAT FACES bothered at the start, lodged a
mild middle move to better his position the third quarter then faded through the lane. JUNGLE RUNNER was finished after a half while racing three wide.

Footnotes
AQWAAM took over soon after the start inside, set the early pace, dueled, shook clear when straightened for home, well clear, kept to task. ELITCH off a
step slow, dropped inside through the first turn, continued to save ground into the far turn, in some traffic, moved out into the two path late in the second
turn, finished willingly to be clear for the place, no real threat to the winner. OFF SIXES off a step slow, in the two path first turn, moved out to be five wide
when mounting a mild advance late in the second bend, along for the show while not a threat to the top two. DEALIN' STELEN settled in mid pack, three
wide and in traffic late in the second turn, four wide into the lane, improved bit late while between horses at the wire. YOU SPLIT TENS forwardly placed
when in tight and shuffled back slightly into first turn, in the second flight in the run up the backstretch, saved ground through the stretch, came up empty for
the drive. I WILL STAND pressed early, dueled outside the winner the middle half, faltered when the real running began at the head of the lane. CANDY
CARLOS within striking distance while racing three wide, had little left for the drive. TASHKENT raced four wide when off the pace in the first turn, continued
outside to be four wide in the second turn, lacked a closing kick. LITTLE NO WAY in mid pack early, was finished after a half. ALWAYS A CATCH was
finished early, trailed home.
