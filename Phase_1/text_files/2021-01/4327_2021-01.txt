THE LONE ROO stalked the pace into the far turn, rallied steadily three wide to make the lead before the furlong marker and drew clear under right handed
urging. ONLYATTHESHOE pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, made the lead, set the pace into the stretch and gamely gained second. FRED'S
COUNTRY BOY away alertly, set a pressured pace towards the inside into the far turn, dug in when headed and finished with good courage. WILDCARD
PRADO failed to menace. DIMATE was no factor. BURKIE well placed, failed to respond. MAXIMUS IMAGE was outrun. THIRSTY ACTOR settled mid
pack two wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
WEBER had speed from the start along the inside, shifted outside the leader before a half, prompted the pace two wide into the stretch, mad the lead near
the furlong marker and finished full of run to win as much the best. SIR SWAYSALOT broke in front, set the pace into the stretch then was no match for the
winner. ROBERTOS TICKET stalked the pace and finished with good courage four wide. SUNDAY DRIVE broke in a tangle, steadied between horses
entering the clubhouse turn, offered a strong bid along the inside nearing the top of the stretch then came up empty. CAZMAN was no threat. YESUS STAR
failed to menace. PRIME TIME stalked the pace three wide into the stretch then gave way. SUGAR DOG FOX was through after a half. KISS YOUR BRIDE
trailed.

Footnotes
AMIGO'S AFFAIR pressed the pace along the inside into the turn, made the lead in hand, shook clear at the top of the stretch and won under mild urging.
SKY WRITER stalked the pace three wide and finished second best. SWAMP RULER never far back, finished well along the inside. ABLE BAKER
CHARLIE allowed to settle, swung wide and rallied belatedly. TOTAL FUTBOL allowed to settle, moved up in the three path into the stretch then failed to
sustain that bid. MUNTIJ had good early speed and faded in the stretch. EARLY DELIGH was outrun. OFF THE MARK away alertly, set a pressured pace
two wide for three furlongs then was used up. GOOD MORNING JACK was outrun.
