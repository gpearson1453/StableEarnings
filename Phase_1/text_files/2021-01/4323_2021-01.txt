HENRY MAC away well loomed inside pressing to upper stretch digging in near the rail there prevailing gamely. SWEET LEMON DROP set a pressured
pace dueling abreast rival through the lane ceding grudgingly in the final yards. RUN BUBBA RUN rallied outside on the turn looming three deep in upper
stretch lacking a final surge. HAKMAN gained on the turn coming five wide in upper stretch finishing evenly near mid track. KISSINGER played no factor.
YOU'RE MY BOY BLUE was checked in tight quarters early. HOME RUN POWER pressured through the turn then wilted abruptly in upper stretch.
