DADDY COOL CAT challenged for the early lead, dueled throughout, while saving ground and prevailed for the win. OUR BLUE JAY pressed the pace,
made a late rail bid, was outfinished for the win, but got up for second. PEPPER JACK raced in the back of the field in the early part, made a late gain, while
putting forth a game effort. DISIDE raced evenly near the back, had a wide trip, made a mild bid, but was no factor. WILD FIREMAKER raced within striking
distance and weakened down the final stretch. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN lacked early speed and was never a threat. HEATHER'S REQUEST raced in the
middle of the pack, saved ground around the second turn and was outrun. LAUGHING LATINOS went to the front, drove clear and dropped back.

Footnotes
MOLLY GOLIGHTLY squeezed back at the start, racing near the back, made a steady gain, moved up quickly on the outside around the final turn, made a
wide rally and drove clear. CALAJA showed early speed, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. OLIVIA'S
DUCHESS raced within striking distance, was close throughout, but proved no match for the top two. CATCAKE was bumped at the start, raced in the
middle of the field and put forth an even effort. MY MALLORY'S ON void of early speed, moved up, racing wide, but was no factor. COOL DEAL lacked
early speed and passed tired ones. DIGNITYTO INFINITY sprinted to the front, drove clear and dropped back. DR. FRANKIE KAYE raced evenly near the
back and was never a threat. CHATAIN'S FLYER broke in, bumped rival, pressed the early pace and stopped.
