Footnotes
COMMERCIAL FLASH broke very alertly and went straight to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, brushed with a foe inside the half-mile
pole, vied in the two path on the turn, shook clear at the five-sixteenths, responded well when set down in upper stretch and drew off under steady urging.
GILDED APPLE broke out and was away towards the rear of the field, moved up to track the pace on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, turned into
upper stretch under a drive and proved no match for the winner while able to get the place. HIP FLASK broke in and bumped hard with a rival, was well
placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch and weakened while well clear for the show. CUSTOM GULCH
checked when LIL BAD LIL BOUJEE came in early, moved out while off the pace, went four wide early on the turn then shifted six wide, drifted out some in
upper stretch and failed to threaten. MAGIC COY pressed the pace on the outside, brushed with a foe inside the half-mile pole, vied in the three path on the
turn, dropped back late on that bend and tired. SPEAK BRILEY settled off the pace, was urged three then two wide on the turn and failed to respond. LIL
BAD LIL BOUJEE was bumped in the hindquarters after the start, dropped in from behind horses while eager early and put CUSTOM GULCH in trouble,
settled off the pace, saved ground under urging on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and was no factor. CLOCKED IN TYME broke out and was
taken up sharply at the start, spotted the front many lengths, raced at the rear on the far outside, went six wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch
and never reached contention. NOTTODAYFELLAS was bumped hard at the start then forced into another foe and bounced around, raced well back in the
field, dropped from five to three wide early on the turn, moved to the rail around the three-eighths and also was no factor. SHARP BUZZ bumped hard twice
with a rival at the start while also bumping with another foe then was squeezed back, moved out sharply around the five-eighths, went five wide on the turn

Footnotes
FREEDOMFI went five then four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along in the two path early on the far turn, dropped to the rail near
the three-eighths and put STRIKING STAR in tight, gained coming to the quarter-pole, spun three wide into the stretch then split foes, rallied to the lead
outside the furlong marker, drifted in around the sixteenth-pole and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. BAYOU JAM was in tight after the start then
dropped in, saved ground on the first turn, moved out early on the backstretch, was roused four then five wide on the far turn, floated seven wide into upper
stretch under a left-handed whip, closed well to make a bid outside the furlong marker, battled with the winner into the final sixteenth-pole, drifted in closer to
that foe late and just missed while clear for the place. TAKING NOTES went to the front, set the pace in the two path with company to his outside, was
asked in the two path midway through the far turn, came under the whip in upper stretch, lost the lead outside the furlong marker and weakened but was
clear for the show. STRIKING STAR went three wide on the first turn, settled on the inside of FREEDOMFI, was urged along against the rail while still inside
that foe early on the far turn, dropped back while taken up when FREEDOMFI dropped to the inside around the three-eighths, shifted to the two path shortly
thereafter, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. OUTLAW X. went four then three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the
outside, was asked while three to four wide on the far turn then driven five wide into the stretch and came up empty. GUITAR KING was hustled from the
start, went three then two wide on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, came under urging while inside on the far turn, was put to the whip at the
five-sixteenths, spun into the stretch in the two path, chased under a drive while dropping back to the rail into the final furlong and capitulated. RICHIE
GARY was last to commence, raced in the six path on the first turn, lagged well behind, went three to four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the
stretch under the whip then moved further out and was no factor. STANDING MAN raced in the three path on the first turn, prompted the pace on the
outside, drew even with the leader midway down the backstretch, was asked in the three path on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and tired.
Following the race, the rider of STRIKING STAR claimed foul against FREEDOMFI for alleged interference on the second turn. After the stewards' review,
no change was made to the order of finish.

to the wire and narrowly prevailed in a three-way photo. GASTOWN was bumped at the start and forced in, went two to three wide on the first turn, was
reserved at the back on the outside, moved closer while three to four wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong
and closed well to just miss while narrowly able to get the place. OUTKICKTHECOVERAGE broke in and hit the gate then bumped with a foe, went three
wide on the first turn, was rated off the pace, came under urging while four then five wide on the far turn, rallied outside to take the lead into the stretch,
drifted in under vigorous urging inside the furlong marker, brushed with the winner while battling with that foe into the final sixteenth, rubbed saddles with
that foe while battling determinedly to the wire and just missed while well clear for the show. MON CHERIE rounded the first turn in the two path, was rated
off the pace, ranged up two then three wide on the far turn, made a bid between horses outside the quarter-pole, battled under a drive into the final furlong
and weakened. TIZINDY QUEEN saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was roused in the two path on the far turn, came three wide into
the stretch then moved out six wide approaching the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. DOUBLE DARE YOU was taken in hand early, went
four wide under restraint on the first turn, was hard held while tugging at the bit on the outside, went three to four wide while let out on the far turn, made a
bid between horses outside the quarter-pole, dropped back passing the three-sixteenths and came up empty. MY ALIBI went to the front, set the clear pace
in the two path, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead into the stretch and stopped. (Rail at 15 Feet)

Footnotes
MY BOY GUS moved in early while showing good speed and quickly went clear, set the pace while in hand, dictated terms in the two path through the turn,
responded well when asked at the three-sixteenths, drew off under the whip into the final furlong and maintained a safe advantage under steady urging. BIG
NICK was fractious in the paddock, settled at the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and finished willingly for the
place. DOUBLE TOUGH TIGER broke out then bumped with a foe and was off a step slow, was coaxed along on the outside, went five wide under stronger
encouragement on the turn and improved position to get the show. HALEYS SAILOR was coaxed along on the inside of a rival in the second flight, chased
inside under strong urging early on the turn, came out under a left-handed whip inside the five-sixteenths and bumped with a foe, was driven hard into upper
stretch and weakened. PILOT PRINCE broke a step slow, raced just off the pace on the outside in the second flight, chased two to three wide under strong
urging on the turn, bumped with a rival outside the quarter-pole, turned into upper stretch under a hard drive and tired. HOOKED A GOODWIN broke out
then bumped with a foe and was off a step slow, settled off the pace under some urging, went four wide while ridden along on the turn, came five wide into
the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
KINGPIN stumbled just after the start, leaned on a rival under urging midway down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, swung five wide
into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed fast late to get up under strong urging. ABOUT OUR TIME leaned on a foe while well spotted
midway down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, was roused in the two path into the stretch, chased the leader under the whip, made a bid outside
the sixteenth-pole, took the lead about forty yards from the wire but was caught while able to get the place. A SONG FOR ARCH settled on the outside
under some urging, went three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and finished with good courage for the show. LAND MARK DEAL settled
towards the rear of the field, rounded the turn in the two path then came three wide into the stretch, found his best stride into the final furlong, angled out
near the sixteenth-pole and finished with good energy to just miss the show. HOMEBRED was bumped hard on both sides at the start then pinched back,
quickly darted to the inside, was reserved at the rear, raced under restraint while behind horses into the turn, saved ground on that bend, was roused while
swinging five wide into the stretch and finished well but was too late. HILTON MAGIC showed good speed and set the pace, raced inside on the turn, was
set down in upper stretch, led under a drive to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken. LADDIE BOY lunged in at the start and bumped hard with a rival,
settled on the outside, moved in late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. SPECTROLITE broke out and bumped
hard with a rival, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn and tired. MASTER GUNS broke towards the rear of the field, raced
outside near the back, went three wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. (Rail at 15 Feet)

Footnotes
SARANYA broke awkwardly then bumped with a rival, went to the front, set the pace near the inside, responded well when set down in upper stretch, kicked
clear outside the furlong marker and proved best under strong urging. POSTNUP bumped with a rival at the start, was well placed just off the pace on the
inside, drafted behind the leader on the far turn, was asked at the top of the stretch then chased under a drive, moved out near the sixteenth-pole and was
second best. JUNGLE CAT bumped with a rival early then was taken in hand, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under
urging leaving the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the two path, was put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response while along for the
show. SPARE CASH bumped with foes on both sides at the start, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, saved ground on
the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, moved out inside the furlong marker and improved position. SWEET WORKOUT went three wide on the first
turn, settled on the outside towards the rear, raced three wide on the far turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. POINT OF INFINITY
bobbled slightly at the start, bumped with a foe early, was carried out nearing the first turn, went four wide on that bend, settled on the outside, was roused
four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. OSTRACIZE went four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside,
made a bid in the three path on the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and came up empty. PRINCESS TINE (FR) came out nearing the first turn, went
three wide on that bend, settled off the pace, raced three wide on the far turn, was roused five wide into the stretch and also failed to respond. FOREVER
MESA bumped with a rival at the start, went four wide on the first turn, was unhurried at the rear, raced inside to the two path on the far turn, swung six wide
into the stretch and was no factor. BUNNINGS (BRZ) bumped with a rival at the start and was last away, angled in quickly at the rear, saved ground on the
turns, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. ART ROCK was taken in hand behind horses early, went four to five wide on the first turn, settled
on the outside, went five wide on the far turn and capitulated. PEACE NICKER became rank when placed under stout restraint early, went three to four wide
on the first turn, was rated just off the pace on the outside, went four wide while let out on the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and faltered. (Rail at 15

DEFEATER broke a step slow, moved out under urging midway down the backstretch, dropped from three to two wide early on the turn, bumped with
CHROME FINISH coming to the five-sixteenths, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed fast to get the lead while drifting in coming to the furlong marker,
put the runner-up in tight quarters while taking control then powered clear under steady handling. COLONEL BOWMAN tracked the pace on the inside of a
rival, chased two then three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained to make a bid between horses approaching the eighth-pole,
steadied twice when put in tight quarters by the winner in the final furlong, altered to the outside late and earned the place. GERSHWIN was away alertly,
contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, lost the lead near
the furlong marker and was outfinished while well clear for the show. DIVINIUM disputed the pace on the outside, vied outside of a foe while in the two path
on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. DONZI broke a half-step behind the top three wide, stalked the pace on the outside, chased three wide
early on the turn then was carried four wide, spun five wide into the stretch and came up empty. CHROME FINISH was off slow and spotted the front a few
lengths, angled in while settling off the pace, saved ground on the turn, bumped with the winner nearing the five-sixteenths, moved out in upper stretch and
came up empty. OGRE'S LION KING was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced at the rear under urging, went two to three wide on the turn,
turned into the stretch under the whip and failed to respond. Following the race, the rider of COLONEL BOWMAN claimed foul against DEFEATER for
alleged interference in the final furlong. After the stewards' review, no change was made to the order of finish.
