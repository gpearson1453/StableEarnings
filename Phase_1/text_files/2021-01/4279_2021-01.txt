Footnotes
JACKSON STRONG was urged to gain the lead along the rail dictating the pace inside rivals on a narrow advantage, extended that margin on the turn, held
sway on a safe advantage into upper stretch and maintained the lead under pressure. BLACK V. K. brushed the gate while breaking a bit awkwardly to be
off last, settled off the leaders while switching out early, angled four wide racing into the stretch and continued willingly to close the gap while edging a rival
for the place honors late. JUMP BACK JACK, caught five wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards racing into the turn while being prompted to advance
three deep on the leaders, couldn't gain even terms with the winner in upper stretch and flattened out late. THROWN FOR A LOUPE broke readily,
prompted the pacesetter between foes racing to the turn and gave way after a half. MOONLIGHT GRAHAM flashed brief pace four wide, then three deep
between foes racing to the turn but soon gave way. LIL GREEN MACHINE, in touch with the first flight between foes in the opening stages, dropped out
early.

Footnotes
THE GODDESS LYSSA broke sharply, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin racing a bit off the rail into the turn, then widened to a commanding
advantage while being kept to firm hand urging past midstretch and was gathered in hand approaching the wire. STARSHIP REINA tracked the leader three
wide between foes from just out of striking distance racing to the turn, shifted inwards entering the lane and continued with interest between foes to prevail
for the place honors. CAUGHT UP IN YOU settled last near the inside racing through the backstretch, shifted out three wide entering the lane to split foes
and continued well enough to edge a rival for a share on the wire. SUZIE'SSTEPPINOUT angled to the inside in early tracking the pacesetter as part of the
second flight, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid. ITALIAN JUSTICE, urged to a forward placing in the opening quarter, continued in
pursuit of the winner to upper stretch and came up empty. FOXY MISCHIEF broke awkwardly, was righted to track outside foes four wide in second flight to
upper stretch and faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
MELISSANI, urged prompting the pace three wide into the first turn, went clear racing into the far turn, held sway well off the rail racing to upper stretch,
drifted out to the four path in the closing stages but held the challenge of MARIALUISA to the end under firm encouragement. The latter, caught four wide
racing into the first turn tracking off the first flight, was prompted to make a steady advance between foes entering the far turn, angled to the rail nearing
midstretch to challenge for command inside the winner but was outkicked. DREAMINOFDASIES tracked off the first flight three wide between foes in the
backstretch, improved her position in that path racing through the far turn to upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. RIDGELYSREDHOT, urged to
the lead inside rivals, then between foes prompting the pace into the backstretch, pressed inside the eventual winner to the far turn and gave way into the
lane. KAUFY FUTURES settled outside rivals racing to the first turn, continued four wide on the far turn to upper stretch but had no closing bid. BIZNESS
BEAUTY angled to the inside tracking off the first flight and steadily faded racing into the far turn. AMBER PRINCESS was urged along the rail prompting
the pace in the opening quarter but was spent early.

Footnotes
GRIMGRINNIN' GHOST urged to prompt the pace between foes, then outside a rival racing into the backstretch, went clear racing into the far turn, held
sway on a comfortable margin in the two path racing into the stretch and maintained that advantage under pressure. AMERICA'S SIMMARD was urged to a
forward placing three deep racing through the first turn, continued in pursuit of the eventual winner on the far turn to the lane but proved only second best.
OUT OF PATIENCE, caught four wide racing into the first turn, was rated off the first flight nearing the backstretch while shifting inwards a bit, was prompted
to advance three wide on the far turn into the lane and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share on the wire. D'URBAN PARK, caught five wide
racing into the first turn, continued four wide through the backstretch tracking off the first flight, angled to the rail on the far turn, was urged inside foes to
lodge a brief bid nearing midstretch but flattened out late. WILD ABOUT YOU settled well off the field near the inside racing to the backstretch and failed to
menace thereafter. IRISH VALOR, shuffled out of close quarters racing to the first turn, tracked the leaders along the inside to the second bend and steadily
faded. THREE DEEP, urged along the rail forcing the pace into the first turn, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
OYSTER BOX was rated outside foes tracking off the first flight racing three deep to the first turn, continued under light reserve outside a rival through the
backstretch, angled three wide entering upper stretch when presented an opening to split foes challenging for command near midstretch and went clear late
under pressure while her right flashed a right handed whip. FUNWHILEITLASTED tracked just off the first flight between foes racing to the first turn, gained
terms with the pacesetter between foes midway through the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn to gain a narrow advantage racing into upper
stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. TETE A TETE, urged along the rail prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, dueled
for command on the far turn into upper stretch and yielded late. COOL FRONT broke readily, prompted the pace outside a rival on a narrow advantage to
the first turn, shifted three wide after a half maintaining terms with the first flight, was urged to press the issue in that path on the far turn but drifted wide
entering the lane and gave way. WORKIN ECLIPTICAL was rated inside rivals tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, continued along the
inside to the far turn and faded into upper stretch.

Footnotes
FLORIDA TWO STEP, urged to the lead inside foes from the break, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage a bit off the rail racing into the turn, shook
clear entering upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm encouragement. BATTLE RAGS, in touch with the pacesetter between foes prompting that
rival into the turn, pressed the issue to upper stretch, proved no match in the closing stages and was taken in hand nearing the wire once the issue was
decided. STERLING ICE, urged to a forward placing three wide prompting the leaders into the turn, had no closing bid but continued with interest to edge a
rival for a share. JUSTLYREWARDED tracked off the second flight in the opening quarter, advanced four wide on the turn to upper stretch to gain some
position but was outkicked for a share. TOMMY TUESDAY angled inwards tracking off the second flight in the opening quarter, swung out five wide in upper
stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. YEUDIEL tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn and faded in late stages.
MATCH RUNNER settled inside foes in the opening quarter and never gained contention. THREE HOMBRES tracked the leaders between foes in second
flight and gave way nearing the lane. ERIN GO BRAUGH dropped out early. GO ABA GO trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BOURBON TAN, urged to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on a clear margin to the far turn, then gamely held the challenge of MY
BROTHERSLEDGE through the last furlong under firm right handed encouragement. The latter stalked the pacesetter along the inside under light rating into
the backstretch, shifted out entering the lane while being prompted to advance and continued willingly to the end to press the issue while proving only
second best. ARMANDO'S TEAM was rated off the second flight in the opening half, advanced three wide on the far turn into the lane and continued to
make a mild gain. VINCENT VAN GOGO settled in the last flight along the inside, swung out five wide entering the stretch and made some belated
progress. VINTNER switched off the inside early tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, then continued three wide into the lane in an even effort.
OUTSTANDING DEBT, urged to a forward placing racing to the first turn, tracked the pacesetter outside a rival in second flight and faded into upper stretch.
ZACAPA RUN, off slowly, settled while switching outside foes, was caught four wide racing through the far turn and offered no rally. TEXAS GIANT proved
no factor. NEAT STREET tracked off the second flight between foes and faded after a half.

Footnotes
IMPERIAL IVOR, unhurried between foes dropping off the second flight while angling inwards nearing the turn, steadily advanced to striking position three
wide between foes into upper stretch and came through close quarters in the final stages to narrowly prevail under firm handling. THE SPIDER, forwardly
placed between foes, tracked off the first flight racing to the turn, shifted four wide gaining on those foes to secure the advantage between calls late, just
failed to contain the winner. HE HAD A SECRET angled to the inside early, saved ground on the turn, shifted out to gain position between foes just off the
inside, altered course avoiding tight quarters to split rivals inside the winner but was just outkicked. FLASH IT tracked off the second flight near the inside
racing to the turn, angled out five wide entering the lane and continued to close the gap while outkicked by the top trio. FLUENT IN SARCASM, urged inside
foes disputing the pace, dueled for command to midstretch and yielded late. MALETTA broke sharply, angled inwards forcing the pace outside a rival,
dueled to midstretch and gave out late. MONEY HOUSE bobbled at the start, settled near the inside racing to the turn, then shifted out four wide in the
closing stages while gaining some position. LOGSDON settled off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn and never gained contention. BOX
CANDY broke slowly and failed to menace thereafter. FELON tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch.
HAPPY DANZA, caught six wide in early stages, soon dropped out. SEATTLE COUNCIL made brief pursuit of the leaders four wide between foes to the
turn but emptied out nearing the lane.

Footnotes
WESTWARD LOOK, forwardly placed along the rail racing to the first turn tracking a rival's pace under light rating, switched outside that foe steadily
advancing to wrest command midway through the far turn, went clear under pressure racing past midstretch and was taken in hand nearing the wire once
the issue was decided. DELFT BLUE was rated off the second flight inside foes racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and steadily gained
position to prove best of the others. OUR GREY GHOST settled last between foes racing to the backstretch, split foes three wide leaving the far turn, angled
four wide in upper stretch and continued with interest while gaining a share. MONDAY'S WITH MIKE tracked the pacesetter outside the eventual winner as
part of the second flight, advanced in tandem with that foe to bid three wide into the lane but flattened out. NEVERMINDNINETYONE settled inside foes in
early stages and passed only tiring rivals. GRAY GILDING settled near the inside racing to the backstretch and proved no threat. BEACH BANDIT tracked
off the second flight outside foes, continued three wide into the lane and had no closing bid. DEVILISH TAIL angled inwards tracking off the second flight
racing to the backstretch and faded inside foes intot he stretch. BRO GUN settled outside foes in the last flight early and proved no threat. UPRISE was sent
clear to the backstretch, set the pace to the far turn and emptied out nearing the lane.
