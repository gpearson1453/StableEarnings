Footnotes
PLEASE ME was never far away to the turn, moved up inside then shifted outside of ONLY THE FACTS nearing the quarter pole, was three wide into the
stretch then rallied when set down and wore down that one to the line. ONLY THE FACTS had the best speed, set the pace in the two path to the stretch,
responded to mid stretch then could not stall the winner. TOO HOT FOR CURLIN trailed to the turn, was off the rail to the stretch then did not threaten the
top two. ENVY prompted the pace to the turn, was pushed out slightly by the winner nearing the quarter pole and steadied, straightened but finished evenly.
SUMMER APPARITION chased the pace early, was three wide on the turn then took up to avoid ENVY nearing the quarter pole and also finished evenly.
The jockey on ENVY lodged an objection against the rider on PLEASE ME for alleged interference nearing the quarter pole but in a unanimous decision the
stewards made no change.

PERFECT COME BACK rated kindly off the leader to the second turn, responded to pressure three wide, pushed to the front in mid stretch and held
determinedly. THE REF sped clear to the backstretch, set the pace in the two path to the stretch then could not hold off the winner but dug in stubbornly to
save second. CRIMSON CLOUD bumped with RED CLEM nearing the first turn, tracked the pace from the rail to the stretch then could not offer the needed
late response. RED CLEM was bumped by CRIMSON CLOUD and jostled between rivals into the first turn, settled to the far turn, tried to respond two wide
to the stretch but finished evenly. ON THE WINGS OF had no speed, trailed to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then did not rally. REY
COLIMAN stalked the leader early then settled on the backstretch, raced three wide on the far turn but was not a threat in the drive. KID ARCADE chased
the pace to the half, offered his best try four wide on the second turn but lost his punch in the drive.

AWESOME AMANDA was on the pace from the outset, edged away two wide to the stretch then responded in the drive and held. PERSUASIVE LIPS
pressed the leaders to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then could not catch the winner while easily besting the others. ABRAA JABRAA hustled
inside the winner to duel to the turn, got outkicked and pressed two wide to the stretch then went evenly in the drive. MARJORIE E was awkward in the early
stages and trailed to the turn, saved ground to the stretch but was never a threat. URBAN DIVA got outsprinted early, also raced two wide to the stretch
then gave way.

Footnotes
KING OF SPEED was well placed to the second turn, rallied three wide to engage for the lead, dueled to mid stretch then dug in gamely and held off OUR
SILVER OAK. The latter threw his head in the early going then settled and chased the pace to the half, circled rivals four wide to the stretch, rallied and was
on terms with the winner in mid stretch but got outkicked late. LYMEBYRD was in tight behind rivals and raced in check from the thirteen sixteenths to the
three quarter pole, pulled once clear on the backstretch, raced two then three wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task in a good
effort. AMERICAN FARMER had no speed, settled to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch then could not muster the needed late response.
JAMMERS JUSTICE set the pace while off the rail to the second turn, responded when hooked, stayed on to mid stretch then weakened. WINE AND
WHISKY stalked the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then tired.

Footnotes
YOU WANNA EAR RIP chased the pace to the turn, was fanned five wide to the stretch, rallied when set down and pushed to the front driving. TRULY
FABULOUS had no speed, was outside the winner and forced six wide to the stretch then closed steadily late. SHANGHAI FANTASY hustled to contest the
pace, dueled two wide to the stretch, pushed to the front in mid stretch then was collared and weakened. DISCERNMENT threw her head and broke about
three lengths last, raced three wide to the stretch then was bumped between rivals in mid stretch but finished willingly. SILLY NOTION had no speed, was
fanned four wide to the stretch, shifted widest for the drive and came on late. THRILL'S LEGACY was uncomfortable inside rivals to the turn, shifted off the
rail, raced two wide to the stretch, bumped with DISCERNMENT in mid stretch and finished evenly. HEAT SEEKING LETA was chasing the pace two wide
to the stretch, made a bid into the stretch then also bumped with DISCERNMENT in mid stretch and weakened. SHARP MOVE stalked the leaders to the
turn, raced three wide to the stretch, steadied off heels at the three sixteenths and lost any chance. SAY YES SALLY hustled to contest the pace from the
rail to the stretch but tired in the drive.
