Footnotes
KID MAC COOL settled inside, angled out rallying on the final turn, led at the top stretch and remained safe driving. FINANCIAL FREEDOM led inside,
widened before half a mile, was collared but was coming back in a game effort. TAKE YOUR PLACE reserved outside, was asked for run on the final turn
but flattened out. THREATLOVESMIDNITE pursued the pacesetter for half a mile and faded. MR. ROMANCE was taken up inside into the far turn then had
no further response. RINGS OF JUPITER raced within striking range and faltered. LOST IRON chased very wide and was always outrun. DIAMOND
SQUARE lagged far behind losing contact with his field. A claim of foul by the rider of MR. ROMANCE against the winner for interference at the far turn was
dismissed.

SIZZLING ROMA saved ground throughout, bid into the stretch then edged clear late under moderate urging. CASEYOUDIDN'TKNOW dropped back after
the start, angled inside and closed well. GAMBIT'S GIRL hustled to the front inside, moved clear on the turn but weakened in the stretch. VINAIGRETTE
prompted the leader outside then proved empty in the final furlong. TWO CARAT lagged far behind then closed the gap without menacing. GRACE AND
PEACE chased outside the dueling pacesetters and began fading on the turn. MORGANS MELODY lacked speed outside and gave way readily.

LADY PROGURT broke alertly and led inside, repelled numerous challenges then stayed clear driving. B B'S ROCKET pressed the winner throughout but
could not get by in a game showing. MARIAH ALYVIA angled out into the stretch and closed well too late. CLOUT CHASER raced near the inside and
flattened out in the stretch. SPUN RUN dropped back early and lacked a solid rally. MINESHAFT MAGIC lagged well behind then passed rivals without
menacing. BIG PUMA saved ground close up for half a mile and gave way. INTERVENTION chased wide and faded steadily. CHEN'S CLEANSHADOW
soundly bumped at the start, trailed early and was no factor. BAHAMA BREEZE ducked in at the break bumping rival then raced wide and greenly. TEXAS
TUDY urged close up for quarter mile racing wide and stopped. The stewards posted an inquiry into the start of the race.

SEAT OF HONOR under a firm rating hold inside, angled out on the final turn, vied briefly then drew away with energy to spare. MIDNIGHT ACT vied
outside for a mile, was collared by the winner and proved no match late. TERRY'S CHARM chased off the pace outside and lacked a solid rally. EDEN
RIDGE saved ground throughout and continued willingly. IN EQUALITY dropped back wide and flattened out through the stretch. SOLAR WARMING raced
close up in the two path and gave way after one mile. KLAATU earned a narrow advantage along the rail and stopped on the final turn.
