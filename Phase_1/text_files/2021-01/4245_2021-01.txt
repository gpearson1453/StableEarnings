Footnotes
SAPPHIRE JUBILEE tracked just off the leaders three deep in early stages, was prompted to advance while being fanned four wide into upper stretch and
edged forward in time to prevail under firm right handed pressure. CROWN OF JOY settled outside a rival dropping off the first flight racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance between foes on the far turn, angled inside the leaders nearing upper stretch, bid for command along the rail when
presented an opening entering the lane but was outkicked. EXCEED THE GOAL, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out nearing
upper stretch, was fanned five wide entering the stretch while being roused to advance and edged rivals for a share while failing to match the top pair.
TURING MACHINE, in touch with the pacesetter between foes racing to the first turn, was urged clear on the backstretch, held sway into the far turn, briefly
resisted when challenged from both sides midstretch but gave out late. PAYNTER FEST, urged to a forward placing along the inside, ceded the lead to
track a rival's pace through the backstretch, switched outside that foe nearing upper stretch to lodge a brief bid between rivals but came up empty late.

Footnotes
IRONY OF REALITY, reserved last along the inside to the backstretch, angled outside foes entering the far turn, was prompted to advance while being four
wide racing into upper stretch but continued with a steady late response to narrowly prevail in time under pressure. MORNING MOLLY tracked just off the
second flight racing three deep to the backstretch, steadily gained position in that path racing into upper stretch, struck the front between calls late but
couldn't contain the winner. CROWN AND SUGAR was rated outside a rival as part of the second flight in the opening half, advanced on the pacesetter to
bid for command between foes midway through the far turn, held sway on a narrow advantage to midstretch but yielded late. NO MERCY PERCY, in touch
with the pacesetter between foes racing to the first turn, shifted inside while continuing under rating through the backstretch tracking the leader from out of
striking distance, briefly awaited an opening, then came around a tiring foe entering the lane, shifted to the inside in the closing stages while being prompted
to advance and just missed for a share. IONIC, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, never gained contention. AGI'S CAIT, urged to the lead
along the inside, held sway on a commanding advantage through the backstretch and gave out midway through the far turn.

Footnotes
BABY BEE MERRY urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin just off the rail racing into the turn, then widened the margin
through late stretch while being kept to pressure. THE LITTLE KITTY attended the pace three deep between foes in the opening half, moved to prompt the
leader nearing upper stretch but soon proved no match while besting the others. DREAM TO WIN tracked just off the first flight nearest the inside, saved
ground to upper stretch and finished evenly late. UPPER SPEED DS tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn, was prompted to advance on
the bend but continued evenly in late stages. CHERRY ROCK BRIDGE, forwardly placed four wide tracking the pacesetter to the turn, faded after a half.
AGELESS ARTIST settled off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn and failed to menace. S K FLYER settled in hand in the opening stages,
angled to the inside after a half and trailed throughout.

PRAETORIAN, in touch with the first flight along the inside racing to the first turn, conceded some position racing into the backstretch to stalk the leaders
along the rail, came through nearing upper stretch to bid for command inside rivals and edged forward to a narrow advantage under firm handling.
SANCOCHO (MEX), forwardly placed three wide attending the pace in the opening half, pressed the issue between foes on the far turn to strike the front
nearing upper stretch, exchanged some contact with CANDY COVE in late stages but continued with a grudging effort to edge rivals for the place honors.
TAPSOLUTE, slow into stride, angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders, shifted out entering the far turn while being prompted to advance, angled to
the five path nearing midstretch to bid four deep between foes in the closing stages and continued with interest to close the gap while edging rivals for a
share. LITTLE MAZZY bobbled at the start, was settled last just off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while being fanned
six wide entering the lane and continued willingly to gain terms with the leaders nearing the wire. CANDY COVE tracked off the first flight outside foes to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide entering the far turn to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, shifted in exchanging some contact
near the sixteenth marker and evened out late. WHISTLE ME HOME sped to the lead between foes, dictated the pace on a narrow margin in the two path to
the far turn, dueled between foes nearing upper stretch into the lane and gave way leaving the furlong marker. OSKAR BLUES angled inwards to track
between rivals in second flight racing to the backstretch but retreated early.

Footnotes
JIMMY P was rated three deep tracking just off the leaders in the opening half, commenced a steady advance in that path nearing upper stretch and
wrested the advantage in the closing stages under firm handling. BROTHER IN ARMS angled to the inside stalking just off the pacesetter racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance inside foes when presented an opening in upper stretch, moved to challenge for command leaving the furlong
marker but was outkicked. AVIANO was rated between foes as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide leaving the midway
point of the far turn, lost some ground to the leaders entering upper stretch but continued willingly to prevail for a share in time. LOVE LIFE, forwardly placed
stalking just off the pacesetter under light rating racing to the far turn, pressed the issue between foes through the second bend into upper stretch but lacked
the needed final kick. RUMELI broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage along the inside under light rating, was prompted to maintain the lead
through the far turn into the lane and gave out leaving midstretch. PROVEN INNOCENT angled inwards in the opening stages to track off the second flight
racing to the backstretch, shifted out five wide racing through the lane while gaining some position late but made no real impression. NAKODA stumbled
badly at the start, then was steadied off PROVEN INNOCENT in the opening stages, tracked off the second flight outside that foe to the backstretch but
retreated early. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

FORWARD MOTION broke sharply, sprinted clear of the field just off the inside racing into the turn, shifted further off the rail entering upper stretch and was
kept to right handed pressure to maintain a safe margin to the end. HIGH FIVE COTTON angled inwards while being urged along pursuing the pacesetter
into the turn, closed the gap on that rival in the three path in the closing stages but proved only second best. LEGACY AZTECA switched out three wide
early tracking the leaders from out of striking distance, was prompted to advance in that path midway through the turn, was fanned to the four path in the
stretch and continued to make some mild progress late. DOODLE HOPPER broke outwards bumping SIX CIDER t the start, tracked the leaders from out of
striking distance along the inside, saved ground to the lane but had no closing bid. SIX CIDER, bumped at the start, switched out three wide early while
being urged to contend entering the turn but failed to menace.

Footnotes
TAPWOOD angled inwards to stalk the pacesetter in hand racing to the backstretch, advanced on that foe on the far turn to bid for command racing past the
quarter mile marker, skirmished with that rival in a protracted duel to late stages but narrowly prevailed under firm left handed pressure. BUGLE OF WAR
broke inwards bumping CONNAGH'S QUAY, was righted, then urged clear along the inside racing to the first turn, maintained a clear advantage to the far
turn, then dueled grudgingly through the stretch resisting the winner to the end to just miss. CONNAGH'S QUAY, bumped at the start, was held up while
being shuffled avoiding some close quarters leaving the chute, angled to the inside nearing the backstretch to track off the second flight, continued inside
foes on the far turn and improved position inside foes in the closing stages while prevailing for a share. SUMMER SILENCE tracked the leaders outside foes
in second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into the lane and continued with an even effort while gaining some position late.
HABITUS was rated near the inside tracking just off the leaders to the backstretch, shifted out three wide on the far turn while being prompted to lodge a
brief bid nearing upper stretch but faded in the drive. ROMP settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. FUTURE
VICTORY, held up avoiding close quarters near the inside racing into the first turn, never gained contention. KAYAKER tracked off the second flight racing
three wide in the opening half, was fanned five wide leaving the far turn and soon gave way. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
HEATHER'S GOLD broke readily to dictate the pace on a narrow margin between foes in the opening three sixteenths, conceded the lead to track just off
the pacesetter into the turn, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch while being urged to regain terms with that foe, then wrested the advantage and just
held EL SICARIO to the end in a brisk drive. The latter was settled last along the inside tracking off the second flight early, angled out four wide racing into
upper stretch advancing on the leaders, came under correction while lugging inwards midstretch but continued to close the gap to just miss.
COMMUNICATION FAIL, urged along three wide forcing the pace outside the eventual winner through the backstretch, went clear racing into the turn,
angled to the rail midway through the bend, held sway past midstretch but failed to sustain that momentum. PELUCHIN CHIN, urged to a forward placing
along the inside, shifted out entering the lane and continued evenly between foes. TIZ THE DUDE tracked off the first flight between foes, advanced three
wide racing into the turn to lodge a brief bid but emptied out racing into upper stretch. ARROGANT MAN shifted out four wide racing through the backstretch
to the turn and steadily faded nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
ACT LIKE ARTIE, pulling between foes under firm restraint racing to the backstretch tracking off the first flight, shifted three wide nearing the far turn while
being prompted to advance, moved to wrest the advantage nearing upper stretch, shifted to the inside once gaining the advantage and held sway on a
comfortable advantage under firm left handed pressure. LAKE PARIMA angled to the inside tracking off the first flight under light rating racing to the far turn,
tipped out entering the lane and proved best of the others. STRICT VOW settled last to the backstretch, shifted four wide nearing the far turn while being
prompted to advance and continued in that path through the stretch to edge rivals for a share. NOBLE MARIA broke in bumping VANA GRAND, was righted
to track off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into the lane and continued evenly between foes late.
KELCIE'S MANDATE, shuffled a bit at the start, settled in hand inside foes, switched out racing into the backstretch while being prompted to gain some
position after a half, was fanned six wide into the stretch but continued with an effort to gain some position. SLEWYS CHOSEN ONE hesitated slightly at the
start, then was a bit rank between foes under restraint tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, was prompted to advance, then steadied between
foes avoiding tight quarters midway through the far turn and lacked a closing response. MAGDALENA, urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing to
the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the rail to the far turn and gave way in the drive. VANA GRAND, bumped at the start, settled along
the rail racing to the far turn but offered no rally. DEGREES OF FREEDOM, caught a bit wide early while being urged to terms with a rival prompting the
pace into the backstretch, gave way between foes nearing the lane. POSEIDONS HEIR tracked off the second flight racing three, then four wide into the
backstretch and faded early.
