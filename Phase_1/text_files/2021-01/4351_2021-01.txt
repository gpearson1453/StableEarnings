Footnotes
ADDY'S LOVE pressured the pace inside and contested even terms nearest the rail on the turn, took the lead as the runner-up drifted into the stretch, and
held on under steady urging. CHARITABLE ANY was hustled along three wide to set a pressured pace, came in a path into the turn and kept a slight edge
most of the turn, drifted and gave up the lead toward the head of the lane, but came back to finish well at the outside withers of the winner. CEDAR RUN'S
FIRE chased the pace through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn and finished evenly. GOT ANY gave chase saving ground and raced evenly in
the stretch. TAPTAP saved early ground then angled to the four path leaving the turn and passed a rival. PIPERS GOLD tapered in to give close chase two
deep while between horses down the backstretch, but was pinched back into the turn and faded through the turn. FIFTY GRAY SHADES was shuffled back
on the chute, rounded the turn about the four path then drifted into the lane. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Addy's Love, lodged
by the rider of Pipers Gold, though took no action.

Footnotes
RUN ON ENERGY rated close toward the inside, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, drew aim in the three path of the far turn, angled four wide into
the stretch and dug in to take over the final yards. MACKENZIE'S STAR rounded the first turn in the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, started
a bid toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn five wide and dug in from the top of the stretch to get second at the wire. LIKE ME OR NOT
rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, kept the edge nearest the rail on the far turn but was caught in the final yards
then nipped from second under the wire. CHARITABLE ROSE saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on the
far turn, eased out into the stretch and finished evenly. DYNACASTLE rounded the opening turn in the four path and settled off the pace into the
backstretch, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response. RAELYN'S STAR settled off the pace in the two and three paths the
first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and appeared a close factor three wide on the far turn, but weakened inside the sixteenth pole.
RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW stalked the early pace two deep then challenged toward the three eighths pole, raced close two deep on the far turn then
weakened. LADY'S CORK was never a factor.

Footnotes
TWOBITSARIDE raced off the pace in the three and four paths then bid into the turn, came through the turn in the five path then dug in to get up the final
strides. DAN THE MAN CAN took the lead nearing the three eighths pole but ceded the nod toward the quarter, contested at a close disadvantage near the
rail then dug in gamely from the head of the lane to turn back NAZCA MYSTERY, while nipped from the win under the wire. The latter of whom was hustled
along to chase the runner-up and took the nod from that one toward the quarter pole, contested the edge two deep on the turn, dug in gamely through the
stretch, though reluctantly ceded second. MELTECH chased the pace inside, was boxed at the rail approaching the quarter pole, resumed his efforts past
the pole and raced close through the turn, and finished well. ORILEYS TYPHOON raced well off the pace, bid into the turn and raced in the five path
through the turn, then finished evenly. CHESTNUT LIME raced well back toward the inside, rounded the turn at the rail and finished evenly. INDIAN
WILDFIRE saved ground on the turn. FIBERTOWN gave chase outside, raced in the six path of the turn and showed little more. SALERNO stalked the early
pace then gave chase from the three eighths pole, though, flattened stride about the four path of the turn.

Footnotes
BOUNDTOBEOK angled to the inside to rate the pace, was met and dueled at even terms from the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the
rail on the far turn, dueled clear inside the eighth pole then widened through the final sixteenth. JAMESTOWN ROAD stalked the early pace, moved to even
terms and dueled from the seven sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn but dropped back inside the eighth pole and
flattened out the final sixteenth. TIZBIT saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, eased
outward mid-stretch and was gaining late on the runner-up. CEDARS BULLS EYE bobbled leaving the gate and raced inside the first turn, picked up the
chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little more. ANGELS CASTLE rounded the opening turn about the four
path and raced outside into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response and raced in the five path of the far turn.
LONG LEGS LOUISE rounded the opening turn in the three path then picked up the chase into the backstretch, though, faded into the far turn. VINTAGE
SPARKLE settled back in the two and three paths and never factored. WHISKEY TALKING settled close inside the opening turn then faded through the
backstretch.

CASTLE FIVE took quick control to rate the pace, came under pressure midway on the turn and held on well under steady stretch handling. COMMAND
THE CAT settled off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and raced five wide on the turn, dug in for second mid-stretch and was gaining on the
winner. MYWALKTOFREEDOM chased the pace from the four path, ceded second mid-stretch then just lasted for third. YOU GO BOY gave chase inside,
raced at the rail on the turn and finished evenly. FLAT RATE stalked the early pace inside, picked up the chase at the quarter pole and rounded the turn
near the rail, then flattened stride the final sixteenth. RING THE BELLA gave close early chase but faded in the four path on the turn. BLAME IT ON HONEY
raced well back and rounded the turn in the five and six paths. FORTY FATHOMS came away rank then saved ground on the turn.

TAKE ME HOME stalked three wide the first turn and settled close into the backstretch, bid nearing the quarter pole, took the lead in the four path
approaching the head of the lane, raced clear into the stretch and drew off under steady handling. SUPER TWENTY FIVE broke outward then closed to
contention and stalked two deep, took the lead nearing the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure at the three eighths but was caught toward the
quarter pole, continued close at the rail through the far turn but was no match in the lane. BIRD TRAFFIC saved ground off the pace then bid toward the
three eighths pole, eased to the seven path rounding the far turn and was along to take third later yards. SURFER GIRL CENTS was bumped leaving the
gate and raced in the six path the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, ran four wide on the far turn and flattened stride in the lane. HEAD
FOR THE SHORE was jostled and bumped into Surfer Girl Cents after the start, rounded the opening turn about the four path, came through the far turn in
the five path and raced evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. YOU MADE IT made light contact with Head For The Shore leaving the gate and raced
off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then weakened the final furlong. SHERWOOD LADY broke
inward then angled in to stalk four wide, rallied to the lead nearing the quarter pole but was caught in the three path toward the head of the lane and
weakened. INTOXICOLOGIST rated a slim early lead inside, was caught approaching the nine sixteenths pole and gave chase into the backstretch, but
faded past the three eighths. SCOTTISH DENIS rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
LA DUQUESA stalked, then picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, came through the turn about the three path, dug in from the head of the
lane to take over inside the sixteenth pole and was steadily encouraged to draw clear later yards. SILKEN BELLE chased through the backstretch and raced
near the rail on the turn, eased to the four path into the lane, closed for second later yards and finished well. MAMA DUNE gave chase and raced in the four
path on the turn then dug in to take over third the final yards. BEST TO BE ME was hustled along to set a pressured pace inside, contested the rail on the
turn, gave up the lead in later yards then flattened nearing the wire. STYLISH PAINT chased the pace inside, raced at the rail on the turn and finished
evenly. RUNNING PRAYERS raced well back early on, rounded the turn at the rail and showed little more. SPRING LASS raced in the six and seven paths
and was outrun. NO SUGAR NO CREAM pressured the pace and dueled at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn but weakened past the eighth pole.
STARSHIP UNITED gave chase and rounded the turn in the eight and nine paths. MANNA FROM HANNAH was not a factor.
