CHARITABLE VISIT rated close to the early pace off the rail, started a three wide bid approaching the three eighths pole and closed to the lead two deep
midway on the far turn, raced clear toward the head of the lane and held well under steady encouragement. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE raced off the pace
and off the rail, picked up the chase past the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, drew to even terms a furlong away but
ultimately settled for second. FOREFRONT surged clear and angled to the rail to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole but was
caught at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened stride the final sixteenth. JACKY'S MAN raced off the pace early on, bid leaving the three eighths pole
and rounded the far turn about the three path, then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. JOEY GOTCHA stalked the early pace off the rail, challenged
toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and weakened.

Footnotes
HEATED was hustled along to set a pressured pace two deep while between horses, contested the edge through the turn, gave up the nod toward the
eighth pole but dug in determinedly to recover the advantage the final yards. TWISTED STORIES pressured the pace inside and contested at a close
disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, took a slim lead a furlong away but was headed in the final yards and grudgingly ceded. MISSION TRAIL
pressured the pace and raced at a close disadvantage three wide on the turn, remained a stretch factor but just lasted for third. SUPER MALIBU angled out
to give early chase, rounded the turn about the five path, finished well and was closing on third. SHECANFLATOUTPLAY gave distant chase, raced at the
rail on the turn and ran evenly down the lane. EXPECTANT HOPE gave only distant chase and raced wide on the turn.

Footnotes
CASTLE BOUND raced in the four path the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn four wide, dueled to the lead later yards
and ran clear under the wire. BINN GOODE tapered in to stalk the early pace then closed to the lead nearing the half mile pole, was met toward the five
sixteenths but contested the edge two deep on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement, though, was caught flattening stride later yards.
KATMAN QUICK saved ground off the pace the first turn, bid approaching the five sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, angled four wide
toward the top of the stretch, got up for third the final yards and was gaining on the waning runner-up. THE CREEP saved ground close to the early pace
then gave chase into the backstretch, remained a factor at the rail on the far turn then flattened out later yards. SUNBRIDLED rated the pace inside, was
caught nearing the half mile pole and gave chase from that point, recovered even terms toward the five sixteenths, continued close at the rail rounding the
far turn then weakened inside the sixteenth pole. CLASSY CROSSING hopped leaving the gate and raced well off the pace while saving early ground,
eased out into the backstretch, offered only a mild bid and rounded the far turn about the six path. CHARITABLE HERO was through early then not
encouraged the final quarter mile.

Footnotes
ANNAMATED MOON settled off the pace in the three and four paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, dug
in to take over the final yards and raced clear under the wire. FANCY CONCHO stalked the early pace then moved to even terms toward the five sixteenths
pole, took the nod at the pole, contested the advantage and drew clear midway on the turn, was steadily encouraged through the lane then caught the final
yards. OUT OF CENTS rated close inside the first turn then picked up the chase at the three eighths pole, steadied lacking room in the three path toward
the head of the lane, angled four wide into the lane, took third mid-stretch and finished evenly. TASTES LIKE PLAID saved ground off the pace, bid leaving
the seven sixteenths pole, angled to the five path toward the head of the lane and passed rivals outside. WONDER IN took the lead and angled to the inside
to set the early pace, was met toward the five sixteenths pole, remained close at the rail rounding the far turn then weakened into the stretch. NICALOE
rated close two deep the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then faded through the far turn. SUNMAN broke awkwardly and
raced in the four path the opening turn, and was not a factor. FLAT RATE rounded both turns about the five path and was not a factor.

AMELIA BEDELIA exchanged light contact with Skylar's Trick leaving the gate, raced in the three path the first turn and stalked into the backstretch, bid
nearing the three eighths pole, dueled to the lead two deep approaching the top of the stretch, raced clear mid-stretch and held on well with steady urging.
PARISIAN DIVA broke awkwardly, took the lead and angled to the rail to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the seven sixteenths pole, was caught
at the rail nearing the head of the lane, dropped back mid-stretch, though, held on for second while flattening stride. CAMERON STREET settled back in the
two and three paths the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, eased to the outside through the upper stretch, dug in to take third the final yards and
finished well while gaining on the runner-up. GRACE ELIZABETH rated just off the pace and off the rail the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and yielded third the final yards. SKYLAR'S TRICK exchanged light contact with Amelia Bedelia
leaving the gate, raced in the four path the first turn and left the turn outside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn
then flattened later yards. SHE FIGURES showed little response through the backstretch and rounded the far turn about the six path.

Footnotes
SPOOKY MOON chased the pace inside and raced at the rail rounding the turn, came outside the pace-setter leaving the turn, was forced inward and into
that one while taking the lead past the eighth pole and dug in determinedly to earn the nod. SHESAUPTOWNGIRL chased the pace and raced in range of
the lead in the three path of the turn, was carried slightly out entering the stretch then exchanged light contact with the winner past the eighth pole and gave
the nod to that one in the duel through the stretch. BELLA FEMMINA chased the pace outside and rounded the turn about the seven path, then finished
evenly while coming along for third later yards. NOT FOR GOLD chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path then flattened stride
the final furlong. MARLEESBEEBEE came away sharply and surged to a clear early lead, was under pressure leaving the turn, but weakened past the
eighth pole. CHARITABLE SHOW broke a step slow and raced well back early on, came through the turn about the three path and could only improve her
position. LOVIN MACHEN steadied early, gave only distant chase and rounded the turn near the rail. SAMMIE GIRL gave chase, rounded the turn off the
rail and weakened leaving the turn. HAPPY FREEDOM steadied leaving the chute, picked up the chase past the half mile pole, though, never factored.
MEGS SQUIRELLYGIRL gave chase and rounded the turn off the rail.
