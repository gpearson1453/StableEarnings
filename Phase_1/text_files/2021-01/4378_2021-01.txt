Footnotes
RUBBER BAND stalked the early pace, circled the turn three deep, swept command entering the stretch, drifted in near the eighth pole and pulled away
with something in reserve. APERITIVO , a forward factor in the two path between horses, chased the pace for a half mile, was not match for the winner,
drifted in near the sixteenth pole and was best of the others. MAGIC MULE sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and weakened
through the stretch. DESPITE ODDS hopped at the break, was a bit rank behind horses leaving the backstretch, circled the turn three wide, angled to the
four path at the head of the lane then steadily retreated. SPANISH CZAR , steadied in close quarters between horses leaving the backstretch, fell back
through the stretch. C TWO was a brief factor along the inner rail down the backstretch and dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
INVEST set a pressured pace towards the inside and under nice rating, shook clear leaving the five sixteenths, wandered outward a bit in upper stretch then
again near mid stretch, dug in when confronted, briefly lost command heading to the sixteenth marker, battled back to duel and just got the bob. HASHTAG
WINNING settled off the pace, advanced under a ride and to the outside of a rival mid way on the final turn, angled four wide continuing progression into the
lane, ranged up and gained a slim lead inside the furlong grounds, sparred outside the winner from there and lost the bob. UNEQUIVOCAL , off the pace
and between rivals leaving the far turn, dropped in and advanced along the rail into the lane, loomed inside foes near mid stretch but failed to seriously
sustain. BELFOUR was caught between foes while contesting the pace into the backstretch, vied two wide outside the winner into the far turn, failed to
match strides heading to the quarter pole, stayed on to pursued past the three sixteenths, steadied briefly in mid stretch then faded. DASHING LOU saved
ground, shifted out in the drive and failed to menace. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD broke a step slow, rushed up soon after, forced the issue three deep,
faltered leaving the far turn then was eased in the lane. An objection by the rider of BELFOUR against the winner for alleged interference in the stretch was
not allowed.

Footnotes
MALICEINTHEPALACE , reluctant to load into the starting gate, rated behind horses into the turn, swung to the five path leaving the turn, gained the lead
outside horses near the eighth pole and drew off while kept under pressure. WALK IT OUT NANNY hopped at the break, advanced four deep on the turn,
gained a short lead in upper stretch, failed to match strides with the winner the final furlong and was best of the others. LA SMARTY chased the pace, raced
in the three path between horses around the turn, challenged for the lead in upper stretch and failed to sustain the move. R AWESUM BETTY lacked speed,
saved ground around the turn, eased out near the eighth pole and passed tired rivals. CARROT CAKE bore in leaving the starting gate, rushed up along the
rail to take the early lead, hugged the inner rail and tired in the drive. RYE STREET , two wide chasing the pace, gave way near the three eighths pole.
GRAND ENTRADA was outrun. DO I EVER drifted off the inner rail turning for home and faltered.

Footnotes
LOST MY VOWCHER , very unruly pre race, prompted the pace two wide outside the leader, moved alongside through the backstretch run, poked a head in
front with a half to go, turned away an outside threat leaving the three eighths, was nudged along holding position into the lane, responded when put to
firmer asking and widened. PIRATE'S PALACE tracked the leaders three wide, ranged up near the three eighths, failed to kick on with the winner past the
five sixteenths, chased while under the whip nearing the lane, kept on with some effort and was clearly best of the rest. ONE MORE CHAPTER , fractious
pre race, was urged from the gate, found himself well back while saving ground past the five eighths, moved up some along the rail in upper stretch but
lacked a serious finish. STRICTLY BUSINESS , bumped at the break, lagged well back, came four wide for the drive and had some belated interest. LEAVE
'EM LOADED came in at the break and bumped a rival, straightened and sped to the front, set a pressured pace towards the rail, lost command with a half
mile remaining, stayed in contact while under a ride past the five sixteenths, failed to go on entering the lane and retreated. CHICO CON ALEX , reluctant to
load, broke a step slow, raced removed from the rail and failed to respond. RIP IT chased in the two path, was under a strong ride into the far turn then
faltered.

Footnotes
BIG HAMBONE bobbled slight at the break, sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail was taking pressure, was challenged by MR. CHESAPEAKECITY
turning for home, dueled with that one, drifted out inside the eighth pole and dug in stubbornly while remaining on his left lead and determinedly prevailed.
MR. CHESAPEAKECITY , up close down the backstretch, advanced three deep leaving the turn, bid for the lead at the head of the stretch, dueled and
hung. JUSTICE OF WAR stalked the pace, swung to the four path entering the stretch and rallied outside the top pir. PASCAL CHANT , fractious going into
the starting gate, lacked speed, saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and had a slight rally. WASJUANNOWPAUL
lacked speed, raced in the two path leaving the turn and showed a mild gain. GATOR FIFTY TWO , under a hustling ride soon after the break, prompted the
pace outside the winner to the stretch then tired. THATWOULDBEGRAND , three deep on the turn, was not a factor. SING A VERSE , under urging leaving
the turn, came up empty and was eased in the stretch.

Footnotes
SUGAR DADDY tracked two to three wide, was floated out to about the five path entering the lane, straightened and kept close contact, responded when
put to a solid drive in mid stretch, wrested command in deep stretch and was edging away at the wire. PUSH TO START pulled clear early, set a rated pace
towards the inside, wandered out to about the four path entering the stretch, straightened and maintained a clear advantage under steady hand urging past
the furlong grounds, met the bid of the winner near the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. FUGITIVE saved ground, moved up steadily into the lane,
had his rider lose the whip nearing the eighth pole, kept on and bid inside the top pair with about seventy yards remaining, kept trying but wasn't quite good
enough. DEGAS , off the pace and towards the inside, swung four wide into the stretch and had some late interest. ZEN PI broke a step slow, was urged
along three to four wide leaving the far turn, made a mild run mid turn but failed to follow through in the drive. COME AND GET ME broke slowly and was
outrun. ROYAL THUNDER , between foes leaving the half mile marker, weakened.

VIBRANCY stalked the pace, circled the turn four deep, rallied outside foes to take command nearing the sixteenth pole then drew off. UTTERLY
ENCHANTING chased the pace three wide around the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch and finished gamely though no match for the winner. MY
QUEEN MICHELLE saved ground around the turn while stalking the pace, remained along the rail through the stretch and had a late rally. OLIVE'S BUMPA
, in close quarters leaving the staring gate, raced in the two path on the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch rallied mildly outside rivals. VICTORY
TIME set a pressured pace along the rail, drifted to the two path in upper stretch and weakened. PROUD MANDATE prompted the pace between horses,
weakened in the stretch and was eased the final furlong. LAST GREAT dropped back early.

Footnotes
HIBISCUS PUNCH was nicely handled just off the heels of the leaders nearing the turn, rated between foes leaving three eighths, eased out for room into
the lane and set her sights on the leader, responded when roused, forged to command heading to the sixteenth pole and drew out under steady handling.
REMAIN ANONYMOUS settled off the pace, raced two wide nearing the stretch, worked her way between runners inside the sixteenth marker and finished
willingly to gain the place. COMBAT QUEEN stalked off the rail, circled rivals four wide into the lane, churned on and just nabbed the show. MAP OF
AMERICA broke a step slow, rushed up between rivals soon after and put a head in front, took pressure from both sides heading towards the turn, shook
clear into the lane, dug in when confronted past the eighth pole then gave way grudgingly in the final fifty yards. KASHAN had speed to contest the early
pace along the rail, eased back off the leaders into the turn, chased past the five sixteenths and gave way. EXCESS CAPACITY , four then three wide,
attended the pace leaving the far turn, failed to kick on in upper stretch and gave way with a furlong remaining.

Footnotes
FLYIN IT , patiently rated down the backstretch, raced in the two path entering the turn, eased out to the four path leaving the bend, advanced outside
horses in the stretch, gained the lead near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. SHERIFF'S KID prompted the pace outside GOLD PANTHER, gained a short
lead leaving the backstretch, dueled around the turn, and battled gamely inside horses through the stretch. LOVE IS STRONG , three wide the first turn,
advanced three deep on the far turn, challenged for the lead in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. GOLD PANTHER showed speed along the
inner rail and weakened leaving the far turn. FAST FASHION , snugly rated three deep on the first turn, failed to be a factor. QUEEN KARMA , well placed
along the inner rail down the backstretch, failed to keep pace on the far turn, drifted very wide entering the stretch and gave way.
