Footnotes
GRANDPA MUNSTER drew clear toward the seven sixteenths pole and rated the pace inside, came under pressure past the quarter pole and was steadily
handled to hold on well. YOUR MOM KNOWS chased the pace inside, raced close at the rail on the turn, drifted a bit into the stretch and finished evenly. BI
BI CARPE chased the pace through the backstretch and raced in the three path on the turn, came inside the drifting runner-up past the eighth pole and
raced evenly down the lane. BROTHER SKYE gave chase inside and showed little further leaving the turn. THREE BALL hopped at the break then gave
chase toward the outside, raced in the three path of the turn and showed little further. WINSTON broke awkwardly and gave only distant chase.

Footnotes
DYNAFORM rated close to the early pace inside then eased out to stalk past the seven eighths pole, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths and took the
lead two deep approaching the quarter, raced clear toward the head of the lane and was steadily handled to late stretch. TIZEZZY raced in the four path the
first turn and settled off the pace from the seven eighths pole, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths and raced four wide on the far turn, then
dug in to take second inside the sixteenth pole. ENVISION SUCCESS saved ground through the opening turn and drew close toward the seven sixteenths
pole, gave chase past the three eighths, raced three wide on the far turn then ceded second inside the sixteenth pole. THE PREDICTOR took the lead three
wide on the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the seven sixteenths pole, was caught toward the quarter, remained close through
the far turn then weakened. GLAD MOON (GER) settled off the early pace about the three path and raced outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase
toward the three eighths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn then weakened. ADMIRE stalked inside the first two turns then eased slightly out into the
backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, though, weakened on the far turn. FRANKIE DOTS raced well off the pace and showed little
response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
NAUTICAL WARRIOR stalked the earlier pace off the rail then challenged into the backstretch, took the lead approaching the three eighths pole, dueled
clear midway on the far turn and widened under steady encouragement. BOP MARLEY settled just off the pace in the three and four paths, bid toward the
seven sixteenths pole and challenged into the far turn, raced close through the turn but dropped back into the lane and was no match. LET'S GET
PHYSICAL settled off the pace and off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, then dug in under steady
stretch encouragement to take third later yards. MR. SNAP rated a short lead inside, came under pressure into the backstretch and was caught toward the
three eighths pole, gave chase from that point but dropped back midway on the far turn and flattened stride. RIDING CLOUD NINE saved ground off the
pace, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn. PRINCE JACOB steadied through the front stretch and was not a
factor.

Footnotes
JACOB T raced off the pace in the three and four paths the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead
approaching the top of the stretch, drew clear mid-stretch then widened while in an outward drift. TAMAQUA rounded the opening turn in the four and five
paths, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn just off the rail, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the turn, split
horses while making contact with Fibertown in later yards and took second the final strides. RAVIN' MAVEN saved ground off the pace the first turn then bid
past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, dug in through the lane and was outfinished for second later yards. FIBERTOWN
surged to the front at the thirteen sixteenths pole and angled to the inside to set the pace, came under pressure when met at the three eighths pole,
checked in tight at the rail approaching the quarter pole, resumed his efforts through the far turn but was pinched back and checked in later yards. DEREK'S
BOY stalked the pace off the rail then challenged at even terms from the three eighths pole, was caught leaving the far turn and weakened inside the
sixteenth pole. FAPPIANO ROCKET rated off the pace inside, picked up the chase past the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn four wide, then
weakened through the final sixteenth. WHERE'S THE LIME was not a factor. After a Stewards inquiry and subsequent claim of foul against the rider of
Tamaqua, lodged by the rider of Fibertown, the Stewards disqualified the former to fourth place, for causing the disruption of stride of the latter in later yards.

FIBER STRONG took the lead between horses nearing the seven sixteenths pole and set the pace off the rail, contested the advantage nearest the rail on
the turn, drew clear past the eighth pole and held on well under steady encouragement. GOLDEN KEY chased the pace and raced at a close disadvantage
two deep on the turn, but dropped back past the eighth pole and ran evenly down the lane. ENTRY TIME bobbled and broke inward then picked up the
chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn and showed little further down the lane. VIDMER'S COURAGE chased the pace, raced two deep through the turn
and had little left. LAST PARTY raced well off the pace and saved ground on the turn. STOLEN BIZ raced well back.

FLUENT IN SARCASM pressured the pace and contested even terms two deep, then dug in under a determined stretch drive to hold off the late arrival of
WILLIE THE WHALE, who chased the early pace inside, eased to the four path midway on the turn, dug in to take second late stretch and was gaining on
the winner. EPIC WEST set a pressured pace inside and contested even terms at the rail through the turn, continued a factor in the upper stretch but
dropped back inside the sixteenth pole and flattened. MUSTA NEVER MET U chased inside and raced at the rail on the turn, drifted into the stretch and
finished evenly. PAGAN SMART pressured the pace and dueled at even terms three wide on the turn, but dropped back into the stretch and weakened the
final sixteenth. INDUS VALLEY MAN chased through the backstretch, raced in the three path of the turn and finished evenly outside. COCONUT MAN gave
chase and rounded the turn about the six path. FROSTY'S MAJESTY chased outside then weakened in the five path of the turn.

ALPHA CHI RHO took the lead leaving the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to set the pace, was met nearing the half mile pole and maintained
the advantage through the backstretch, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn and dug in under steady insistence to earn the nod. SAINT VRAIN
settled off the earlier pace about the three path and raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole then challenged toward the
quarter, dropped back into the stretch but came again in later yards and just missed taking the nod. LIKE SEGAL stalked the pace two deep then gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced close at the rail rounding the far turn, but flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. TRIPLE TITOS rated close
through the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was eased four wide approaching the head of the lane but showed little
further. JUST NOD AND SMILE raced three wide the first turn and was at even terms into the backstretch, but dropped back toward the seven sixteenths
pole and faded into the far turn.
