Footnotes
MARY OF SCOTLAND was tossing her head around at the break and came out slowest, quickly recovered to a contending position two wide, responded
readily to run past FIOR DI LATTE from outside turning for home, and drew clear under a mild drive. HARDLY SOCIAL raced four wide early, rallied three
wide into the stretch and finished well to clearly best the others. NOT TONIGHT BOBBY was in the second flight and four wide early, came three wide into
the lane and rallied mildly to pick up a share. SHINE A LIGHT settled in the middle of the field early, edged closer saving ground around the far turn, and
was outkicked. SWEET FELICIA was no factor two wide. OKALANI broke a step slow, lagged well back for a half-mile, and improved past tired horses.
FIOR DI LATTE tugged along showing the way four wide into the first turn, gradually moved inward through an even pace, and relinquished command to the
winner leaving the far turn. BROADWAY DIVA was outrun three to four wide. SIP'N DIP stayed in range early three to four wide, and tired after a half-mile.
KERIK pursued the pacesetter for a half and retired. DANCING EMPRESS was eight paths or so removed from the inside around the first turn, remained
well out in the course and showed little.

Footnotes
CHOCOLATE BAR was pinched back at the start, saved ground off the pace, circled four and five wide around the far turn, seized command in upper
stretch and drew off under a drive. LIFE ON TOP saved ground off the pace, steadied nearing the quarter pole, swung widest nearing the lane and rallied
outside. CALL CURT stalked the pace two wide around the first turn, bid three wide midway around the far turn, vied to upper stretch but was outkicked by
the top two in the lane. TURN OF EVENTS dueled along the rail and weakened in the drive. SEMPER FI hopped at the start, was off the pace two wide
early, advanced four wide around the far turn and faded in the lane. RECKLESS SPIRIT chased the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. RHYTHM
SECTION was keyed up three wide around the first turn, moved up to duel down the backstretch and two wide between rounding the fear turn and tired in
the drive. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED AND FRACTIONS WERE UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
SOSOSUBTLE tracked outside the early leaders, took over three wide after six furlongs, drew clear under a drive and was geared down the last sixteenth of
a mile. SWING LOW vied inside PROUD CONTENDER, altered course off the rail after the winner cleared off in mid stretch, and stayed on for the place.
JOSHY JAK raced close up inside to the turn, moved out three then four wide approaching the stretch, and finished evenly. SKYWALKING was bumped
and forced in by FRENCH AFFAIR at the start, moved out four wide past the quarter-pole, and made no impact. PROUD CONTENDER alternated for the
lead outside SWING LOW for nearly six furlongs, and faded through the stretch. SOCIAL EQUALITY moved in from the three-path around the turn, and
played no part. FRENCH AFFAIR broke in bumping SKYWALKING at the start, and was finished early.

KITTEN'S ROMANCE raced off the pace two wide, angled three wide nearing the lane, closed between rivals and was up in the final strides. ALOHA
KITTEN was in a bit tight at the start, raced off the pace three wide around the first turn, advanced five wide rounding the far turn, rallied widest and just
missed. SHE FLED THE SCENE saved ground in midpack, went two wide around the far turn, angled out in uppers stretch, bid between foes, took the lead
in deep stretch but was tagged in the final strides. MERCY MERCY raced four wide in midpack around the first turn, advanced four deep rounding the far
turn and was one-paced in the lane. MAJIC FLASH stalked the pacesetter three then two wide, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, led to deep stretch
and was swallowed up late. TAILADIOS lacked early speed while racing two wide, went four wide around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. MO ME
MO MY tracked the pace three wide, was in tight in upper stretch and lacked a closing bid. ALLEY TO CALVARY chased the pace two wide and faded.
ROONEY was outrun while racing two wide. MISS WROTE set a clear pace in the two path and tired nearing the lane.

Footnotes
CELESTIAL CHEETAH advanced to contention while moving out four wide late on the turn, took over from PRETTY RACHEL with little trouble in upper
stretch and drew off under mild urging. PRETTY RACHEL was nursed along on a short lead in the two-path for six furlongs, had no answer for the winner
turning for home, and held the place while drifting out under heavy pressure. SUNNY ISLE BEACH moved menacingly three wide past the three-eighths, but
flattened out into the lane. SEXY DREAM saved ground throughout, and faded through the stretch. SHINY EMPIRE tired in the four-path nearing the
stretch. MANGROVE MAMMA pressed the pace for five furlongs, and dropped back.

Footnotes
SOUPER WATSON raced closest to the runway pacesetter while saving ground, ran up on that foe's heels entering the far turn, was immediately put to a
drive and quickly regained momentum inside around the bend, tipped two wide late on the turn, bid inside of foes to take the lead nearing the eighth pole,
battled inside of FREEDOM MATTERS through the final furlong, drifted out under left-handed urging late and dug in gamely to prevail. FREEDOM
MATTERS settled off the runaway pacesetter while racing two wide, bid two wide around the far turn, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, battled
between foes in upper stretch, continued to duel outside of the winner through the wire and was denied. ZERO GRAVITY saved ground off the pace, angled
out near the quarter pole, rallied through the lane, angled back in late and gained the show. DOMINATE THEMOMENT settled off the early pace inside,
advanced three and four wide around the far turn, reached near even terms in upper stretch then flattened out. RHYTHMIA exchanged bumps with
ESPRESSO CALIENTE early, raced well back two and three wide and never threatened. MONY was not a threat while racing two and three wide.
ESPRESSO CALIENTE exchanged bumps with RHYTHMIA early, saved ground and played no further factor. SIR SEAMUS hopped at the start, sprinted
clear in the two path, angled in nearing the far turn, set the pace along the rail around most of that turn and retreated. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF
FREEDOM MATTERS AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
PALADIO was never far back, moved three wide to take over the lead coming to the quarter-pole, battled outside CARSON CITY KID through a long drive
and held for the decision. CARSON CITY KID vied early inside HEATHER'S GOLD, got collared by PALADIO late on the turn, dug in along the rail and
stayed on gamely. FOSTER HOPE moved off the rail approaching the stretch, lacked a solid closing bid but was best of the others. COBB broke out
bumping FLORIDA ENDEAVOUR at the start, saved ground into the turn, shifted out four wide near the quarter-pole and made no gains. CRAZY SHOT
brushed the left side of the gate at the start, came five wide into the lane and posed no threat. HEATHER'S GOLD pressed CARSON CITY KID from
outside, and was finished approaching the stretch. EL SICARIO broke slowly and was always far back. FLORIDA ENDEAVOUR got bumped by COBB at
the start, raced two wide around the turn, and tired through the stretch inside.

Footnotes
CANDY FLOWER pressed the pace two wide, seized command near the five-sixteenths marker, edged ahead in upper stretch and held firm under a drive.
COME STORMING rated off the pace inside, angled four wide near the quarter pole and rallied widest. KELLEYCANRUN raced three wide in midpack
early, advanced four wide around the far turn, bid between foes leaving the eighth pole but was outkicked late. TWILIGHT saved ground in range, angled
out in upper stretch and finished evenly. GYPSY WIFE threw her head at the start, trailed inside to upper stretch, angled out and rallied belatedly. KITTEN'S
FINEST saved ground and failed to menace. MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT never threatened while racing three wide around the first turn and two wide rounding
the far turn. PARDON MY HEART played no factor while racing two and three wide. OBSTINATE chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid.
MAKISUPA (GB) set the pace under pressure from the winner and retreated through the lane. SPIN YOUR PARTNER stalked the pace three wide and
came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
ROMARIO was widest of a trio chasing the dueling leaders, finished determinedly in the four-path and won a head-bob decision outside FAKE I D. The latter
bumped with TARQUIN at the start, chased inside early, put in a late bid between horses and lost the bob just inside the winner. DISCREET TUNE dueled
inside GRAND UNION from the outset, edged away on the rail 70 yards out, but was overhauled near the wire. GRAND UNION vied for command outside
DISCREET TUNE to deep stretch, and weakened. MAKE A MOVE broke slowly, was outsprinted three wide to the stretch, and gained some ground without
threatening. JOYFUL SURPRISE was never a factor. BLAKENSTEIN gave chase between horses early, and tired approaching the stretch. TARQUIN
bumped with FAKE I D at the start, and was outrun. SMARTY J AND B was far back for three furlongs, got pulled up in the stretch and walked off the
course, then was vanned off.
