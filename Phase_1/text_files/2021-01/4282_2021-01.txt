Footnotes
SWINGING STICKS bumped at the start, pursued the pace three wide on the turn, was one path farther off the rail challenging for the top coming into the
stretch, worked its way to the lead inside the eighth pole, edged clear despite having the rider lose the whip late. DAGGERBOARD forwardly placed three
wide, disputed the pace from path three as the outermost of a threesome for much of the opening half prior to going at it one on one with WAR OF
THRONES afterwards, was cued up for the drive, got collared with slightly under an eighth to go, stayed on for second. SCOTTY strung out four wide on the
bend, fanned out into the six path from upper to midstretch, ventured onward to be along for the show. WAR OF THRONES springing inward from the
starting gate, made contact with his next stall neighbor, vied for control from path two in between opponents for a good portion of the journey leading up to
the conclusion of the backstretch, before sparring on almost even terms with the second place finisher on the turn, kept up its pursuit in earnest until midlane
then weakened. LOULOVESTHERIVER rode the rail, slipped to the outside after crossing midpoint on the turn, got worked into path five from upper to
midlane to no avail. TAKECAREYALLCHICKN sluggish on the backstretch, took the inside route on the turn, swung out three wide into the lane without an
offering. GO CASH GO spotted along the rail, argued as the innermost of three for about a half, fell back steadily while under a hard drive on the turn,
stepped into the lane cutting the corner, fell back even farther. ANOTHER SHOT two wide on the turn, came approximately seven wide into the lane
protected, was allowed to fade to the rear.

Footnotes
JEMOGRAPHY chased just off the inside from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive rallying through the stretch to get up in the final jumps to the wire. SCILLY CAY chased just off the inside until tucked inside half
a mile from home, came under coaxing five-sixteenths out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied up the inside to take command nearing the
sixteenth pole, dug in and was nailed in the final strides to the finish. THE CARETAKER chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled four to five wide for home and closed well to secure the show honors latching on the top pair as they hit the finish. BRONX BOMBER four then three
wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in and was collared
nearing the sixteenth marker, then got outfinished in the late stages. STEAM ENGINE coaxed from the gate, shook away early on showing the way in hand
three paths off the inside, tucked to the two path through the turn, spun three wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, yielded command a furlong out
and weakened in the late going. BIG MOUNTAIN four to five wide down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn coaxed along at the three-eighths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
SOCIAL GROUP away without apparent mishap, attended the pace two to three wide, got maneuvered three to four wide turning into the lane, straightened
away and went after the lead, struck the front end in the general area of the eighth pole and kicked clear. LOADED JOE argued for the top stationed at a
slight distance from off the rail, felt the presence of LORENZEN as three-quarters was being reeled, drifted slightly to the inside when called upon for more
right around the three-sixteenths marker, relinquished deep into the furlong grounds, held second. LORENZEN tracked the pace along the inside route, was
on hold awaiting options from the five-sixteenths pole to the end of the bend, inched up with good momentum towards a narrow opening along its path as
the third fraction was being finalized, maintained its position, got steadied a few strides later when its path got clamped down to less than optimal size, failed
to fire appreciably afterwards and had to settle for the show. LEGEND OF EKATI two wide onto the turn, got sent out five wide exiting it, made no headway.
BOLD GEM tucked into path three after stumbling at the start, pursued the pace as the outermost of this sextet during the run around the bend, was moved
out into the five path for the drive, had no offering. SEEDISKID sluggish throughout, rode the rail on the turn, shifted out six wide into the stretch, never got
involved. Following a Stewards' Inquiry in addition to a claim of foul lodged by the rider of LORENZEN against the rider of LOADED JOE alleging
interference, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
SUBSIDIZE forwardly placed from the start, got eased back at the first fraction was being finalized after disputing the pace as the innermost of a trio during
the opening phases, availed of the respite then re-bid in hand a furlong down the road, raced directly abreast of the second place finisher the rest of the trip
on the bend, got cued up as the half was being reeled off, won the battle with the nemesis travelling through the furlong grounds, then extended the winning
margin in the final furlong, kept busy to the end. KAWHI ME A RIVER contended for the top from between rivals on the backstretch, was briefly clear before
being confronted by the top one in the general area of the three-eighths pole, was turned loose for the drive home, saw the winner take charge, had no
difficulty salvaging second. Z'DEVIL underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn, swung as wide into the stretch, proved no match. RUN SMITTY RUN
bumped lightly with NERVES OF STEEL in the shadow of the starting gate, chased the pace four wide on the turn, came into the lane and backed away.
JAILBREAKER pursued the pace towards path two during the initial half, was on the inside route going into the stretch, made no headway. KID CASH
departed the backstretch from path four, altered five wide in close proximity to the heels of another spinning into the stretch, had no response. NERVES OF
STEEL made some contact with RUN SMITTY RUN right after the field had been sent off and running, raced three wide on the turn, was in the same path
coming into the stretch, gave way. EPONA RISING sighted on the rail during the run around the bend, tipped into the two path stepping onto the head of the
stretch, always trailed.

Footnotes
LIL COMMISSIONER rated along pressing the issue from path three, wrested away the lead as six furlongs was being run, settled in at the three-sixteenths
marker and was turned loose, responded and kicked well clear. ROCK ON LUKE hand urged, disputed the pace towards the two path, was put to a drive
late on the bend, failed to keep pace, stayed on for second. SOMEDAY JONES along the outside, pursued the pace three wide, got set down a short
distance from the five-sixteenths pole, was moved out into the five path from upper to midlane, secured the show. MIHOS loosely drafted behind ROCK ON
LUKE from the two path for a good portion of the opening three-quarters, went into the stretch, shifted about two to three wide down it in retreat.

Footnotes
LARCENY four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge
through the final furlong to take command a sixteenth from home, then inched away to the finish to prevail. NUMBER ONE DILLON four then three wide in
aim of the front, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, advanced and took over command narrowly swinging three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive under threat, got collared a sixteenth out and ran on to secure the place honors. BREES BAYOU chased five to six wide under coaxing from
the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show honors. NO MORE MIRACLES chased along the inside down the
backstretch and then just off the inside at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share.
MACHO BOY vied briefly with a trio before establishing sole command crossing to show the way in hand from the three path, tucked to the two path through
the turn coming under threat to the outside and was placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front spinning just off the inside for home,
weakened in the late stages. BLUES CITY chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, weakened in
the late going. MR. FIDGET was taken in hand briefly at the start as DAVID'S GEM recovered inwards from a stumble, chased three to four wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SHANDIAN three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the
three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. DAVID'S GEM stumbled at the start recovering inwards, chased just off the inside under
coaxing from three furlongs out, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. HEALY'S HOPE five wide in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the turn,
swung four wide into upper stretch and trailed.
