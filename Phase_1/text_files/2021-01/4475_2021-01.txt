Footnotes
CLOCHARD STREET tracked the leaders to the turn, was forced to circle four then five wide to the stretch, rallied to engage for the lead in mid stretch then
dug in determinedly to edge away. SWEET TOPPER broke out sharply then was corrected, got outrun to the turn, followed the winner five wide into the
stretch then was widest for the drive and bested SPIRIT LAKE for second. SPIRIT LAKE stalked the pace to the turn, was two then three wide to the stretch,
shifted out for room then finished steadily but just missed the place. PACIFIC SILENCE hustled to contest the pace while off the rail, was three wide into the
stretch then was caught by the winner and outfinished. DESERT FOG attended the pace outside of PACIFIC SILENCE, got fanned four wide to the stretch
then was also overtaken in mid stretch and weakened. AFTER SUNDOWN broke a bit slow, had no speed then saved ground to no avail. Final time
updated after review.

Footnotes
MAXINAMILLION pressed the pace to the second turn, bid two then three wide to the stretch, rallied to get on terms with HYDROGEN then drifted inward
under right handed urging causing HYDROGEN to steady then dug in to prevail driving. UBER STAR was allowed to settle to the second turn, raced off the
rail to the stretch then responded inside of HYDROGEN, was on terms with MAXINAMILLION in mid stretch but got outkicked by that one. TOUGH IT OUT
raced unhurried to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch and closed steadily in the final sixteenth. LIFELINE tracked the pace to the second
turn, raced three wide to the stretch then could not muster the needed late response. HYDROGEN set the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the
stretch, came off the rail slightly then was forced to steady when cut off by MAXINAMILLION at the furlong marker and finished evenly. MOONLIGHT BLUE
had no speed, trailed to the second turn then circled five wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. The stewards conducted an inquiry into
the stretch run involving MAXINAMILLION and HYDROGEN and disqualified MAXINAMILLION from first to fifth for interference.

Footnotes
AMERICAN ROYALTY settled mid pack for a half mile, responded when roused into the second turn, rallied three then four wide to the stretch, pushed to
the front in mid stretch and was clear under steady urging. SHAKE IT CALI got outsprinted to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, raced two wide to
the stretch then was rallying but had to check off of DROP THE MIC'S heels in mid stretch, angled out and bested the others. TOOLEY TUNES set the pace
to the second turn, was collared but responded into the stretch then was tiring in the final furlong. SWEET CHAYANE hopped at the start, had no speed,
raced four wide to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. DROP THE MIC pressed the pace to the half, rallied to get on terms with
TOOLEY TUNES three wide to the stretch then was tiring, drifted out slightly in mid stretch and weakened. IT'S BIG AINE had no speed, trailed to the
stretch and was not a factor. PROUD TO SHOYU stalked the pace from the rail for five furlongs then gave way.
