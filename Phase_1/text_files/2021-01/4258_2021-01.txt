Footnotes
PASSAGEWAY tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, gained under a drive to make a bid between horses in upper stretch,
took the advantage approaching the furlong marker and drew away under strong urging. IN THE ARCH was well placed just off the pace, dropped back
leaving the backstretch, chased under strong urging in the two path early on the turn, shifted three then four wide around the five-sixteenths, gained to take
a short lead at the three-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner nearing the furlong marker and proved no match but was clear for the place. PAPAWS
BOY broke a bit slow, settled at the rear on the outside, was urged three then two wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a strong hand ride, was put
to the whip at the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while along for the show. LET IT B broke very alertly and went straight to the front,
showed the way down the backstretch, raced inside on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and tired.
RATTLESNAKE RIVER settled on the outside, was urged along while four then five wide on the turn and came up empty. POETS PRINCESS showed no
speed while ridden along, dropped in leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
EXCESS MAGIC was well placed in the two path, bided his time on the far turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, brushed with a foe while
gathering momentum, rallied outside to take the lead nearing the furlong marker and drew off under strong urging. INVINCIBILITY went to the front, set the
pace while well rated on the inside, was asked once straightened for the drive, lost the advantage to the winner approaching the furlong marker and proved
no match while able to get the place. ROYAL PRINCE bobbled at the start and was off a bit slow, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside,
was coaxed along passing the half-mile pole, raced four wide on the far turn, was roused around the five-sixteenths then driven five wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed response while able to get the show. LAKER MAMBA broke very awkwardly while hitting the outside of the gate and was off slow,
spotted the front a few lengths, went two to three wide on the turns, came four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. INDY TOURIST raced in the three
path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the far turn, brushed with the winner while put to a drive in upper
stretch and tired. NO EXAGGERATION settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and failed to respond. (Rail
at 15 Feet)

Footnotes
TUFFOLOGY was well placed just off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, drafted behind the leaders into upper stretch then was roused, moved
out outside the furlong marker, rallied to the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then drew clear under strong urging. MADISON'S PLACE settled off the pace,
was roused five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and got up for the place. CUSTOM CUT raced well back on the outside, went three to four
wide under urging on the turn, moved out under a drive around the furlong marker and improved position to get the show. MANE PRIORITY disputed the
pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, shook clear in upper stretch, was headed inside the furlong marker and
weakened. STANG IT chased the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn, made a bid while moving a bit further out into the stretch, dropped back
under a drive into the final furlong and tired. CAJUN MUSIC bumped lightly with a rival after the start, was urged along towards the rear, rounded the turn in
the two path and failed to threaten. IONA GUITAR settled off the pace, angled in leaving the backstretch, raced inside to the two path on the turn, shifted
three wide into the stretch then moved a bit further out under a drive and came up empty. MAW MAW'S SOPHIA was very reluctant to load, bumped lightly
with a foe after the start, disputed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn and capitulated. BEAUTIFULANDWILD shifted out early, raced
at the rear on the outside, went six wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and was no factor. HALF MINE settled on the outside, was urged five wide
on the turn and failed to respond.

rivals on both sides early, went four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked while three wide on the far turn, spun four wide into

that same rival early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn
