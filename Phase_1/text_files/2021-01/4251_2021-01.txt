Footnotes
ERIC'S EMPIRE , along the inner rail leaving the backstretch, eased out on the turn, swung to the four path turning for home, drifted out when challenging
for hte lead near the eighth pole and narrowly prevailed. FLIGHT MAP set the pace near the two path around the turn and gradually weakened in the drive.
EXCURSION , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, lacked the necessary late effort. ARRIO , well back to the stretch, raced outside horses and
passed tired ones. RIPPOLINO , two wide between horses around the turn, chased the pace to the stretch then gave way. EXTRASEXYBIGDADDEE
chased the pace, was four wide approaching the stretch and faltered. PITAMAN showed speed along the inner rail and faltered turning for home.

Footnotes
PAISLEY SINGING , off just a beat slow, recovered and edged up towards the rail, was under pressure chasing the leading pair past the five sixteenths,
eased out in upper stretch, closed determinedly under right handed pressure and got up in the final jumps. HALFINTHEWRAPPER quickly went clear, set a
rated rated pace, widened mid turn, entered the lane two wide, remained well clear under pressure past the furlong grounds, kept on gamely but just failed
to contain the winner. FOGGY DREAMS , off the pace while saving ground and under a ride, stayed towards the inside while gathering momentum into the
lane, shifted out near mid stretch and closed steadily. MAGICAL ANNA prompted the pace outside, was under pressure three wide into the lane, gave futile
chase past the eighth pole and faded. LE WEEKEND broke a step slow, was hustled up four wide heading to the half mile marker, failed to keep pace past
the five sixteenths and weakened. FISH TO FRY , urged along three wide into the turn, could not keep up and dropped back.

Footnotes
BOBBY TWO TIMES broke slowly, circled the turn four deep, closed determinedly and was up at the wire. STRETCH THE TRUTH accelerated to the early
lead, set the pace slightly off the rail and gave way grudgingly. GET LIT bumped UNBRIDLED PARROTT when bearing out at the break, saved ground on
the turn, chased the pace and weakened. UNBRIDLED PARROTT , bumped leaving the starting gate, was not a factor. CLEVER AND GREAT raced inside
horses on the turn and was never a factor. LEAVE 'EM LOADED , three wide on the turn, was outrun. CAMP PENDLETON , three wide on the turn chasing
the pace, weakened in upper stretch and was eased. ARTILLERY raced along the inner rail and wasnot a factor.

Footnotes
DAY THE MUSIC DIED broke a step slow, quickly recovered and pulled himself forward in the opening furlong, stalked a contested pace, lodged a sharp
bid along the rail nearing the lane, wrested command in upper stretch, shook clear under a drive in mid stretch and pulled away while steadily hand ridden
the final seventy yards. ODDS ON settled off the rail, circled four to five wide while making headway into the lane, altered towards the inside leaving mid
stretch and kept on willingly to nab the place in the final jumps. PHANTOM RO dueled two wide and to the inside of HIGHER PURPOSE, spurted to a clear
lead nearing the quarter pole, was joined from his inside soon after, sparred briefly then wandered outward and faded in the final furlong. HOLY SAINT , off
the pace, circled five to six wide and advanced with ODDS ON entering the lane, continued progression past the eighth pole but flattened out in the final
yards. EASY RIVER broke outward then steadied to avoid contact, corrected and dropped well off the pace, saved ground into the lane and failed to
menace. HIGHER PURPOSE broke sharply and disputed the pace outside PHANTOM RO, drifted out a bit when failed to keep pace nearing the lane and
tired.

BLUE SKY PAINTER stalked early towards the inside, dropped back some leaving the far turn, chased to the inside of a rival past the five sixteenths,
remained inside through the lane, closed steadily under pressure and got up at the wire. PARDON THE PUN cleared early, set the pace towards the inside,
took pressure from the half mile marker to the five sixteenths, moved clear into the lane, widened under a drive past the three sixteenths, drifted out while on
his left lead and just failed. NEVERFOLD prompted the pace two wide, moved to apply more pressure after a half mile, battled outside PARDON THE PUN
past the five sixteenths, drifted out leaving the three sixteenths and faded. MO AMERICAN , in close at the break, checked mid way on the first turn, moved
up between rivals entering the lane, angled out and kept on with some effort. FAVOR MAKER , three to four wide stalking the pace, was under a ride
pursuing past the five sixteenths and faded. BOURBON AGOGO , reluctant to load, dropped in early and settled off the pace, was under asking saving
ground past the three eighths but lacked a rally. KING PACAY , checked nearing the seven eighths, moved up wide past the five eighths, chased into the far
turn and gave way. NICKY BEAR checked sharply forcing his rider to lose the irons heading towards the seven furlong marker, was taken wide and did not
really recover until the head of the lane. JUSTACALLAWAY , four wide early, angled in and made a run past the five furlong pole, failed to sustain leaving
the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
FEATURE ACT saved ground on the turn chasing the pace, swung to the four path entering the stretch, took command in upper stretch and pulled away
under encouragement. SEATTLE RIC broke awkwardly, was two wide leaving the turn, worked between horses in the stretch and finished willingly.
LUDICROUS MODE , far back for five furlongs, raced outside horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. BACKWOODS BOOGIE circled the turn three
wide, was fanned to the five path turning for home and gave way. KORCZAK saved ground around the turn, remained near the rail in the stretch and gave
way. G MAN sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the rail around the turn and faltered the drive. MUNTAHEZ , three deep on the turn, was not a
factor. GHOST ON A MISSION raced in the two path between horses on the turn and was never a factor. JUST CHILL OUT hugged the inner rail on the
turn and faltered.

Footnotes
NOTTOWAY , keen to the lead, set a rated pace in about the two path while handling some outside pressure, spurted away past the three eighths,
responded when roused entering the lane and eagerly widened under a drive. CERULEAN SPRINGS , towards the inside early, worked between rivals in
the drive and kept on willingly to be second best. ROUGH SEA , off the pace while saving ground, came under pressure mid turn, was briefly stalled near
the furlong marker, eased out and had a mild response. THUNDERSHOOK lacked speed four wide, angled five wide entering the lane but lacked a serious
response. STONE COURAGEOUS , away alertly, rated back off the leaders in the opening sixteenth, chased while saving ground and faded. GREAT
CAMANOE had speed outside the winner, pursued three to four wide into the lane but came up empty. ACE NINE NINE , wide, faded.

Footnotes
RAPIDASHQUEEN assumed the early lead, saved ground around the turn, drifted wide entering the stretch and eagerly drew off while kept to her business.
ROCKSTAR GIRL circled the turn four wide and had a mild rally outside rivals. IMAGINE VICTORY , unhurried down the backstretch, worked between
horses in the stretch and had a slight rally. DELANCEY'S PHILLY saved ground around the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch, chased the winner
and weakened. M. J.'S LADY , a forward factor in the two path between horses on the turn, weakened in the drive. CAR LADY lacked speed, failed to be a
factor and was lightly steadied when lacking room approaching the finish. TOMA , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, floated wide in upper stretch
and gave way. TOTALLY PERFECT lacked speed, raced wide on the turn and was never a factor.
