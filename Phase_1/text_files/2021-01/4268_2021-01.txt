and had no response in the drive. BRAVE RIFLE raced in the middle of the pack and lacked the late repsonse. SUPERCONDUCTOR raced in the middle of
the pack and was not a factor. CUSTOM READY was allowed to settle made a mild bid in the drive and hung. INLIKE FLEN was off a bit slow raced erratic
early and was not a threat. GOLDEN V C was well placed early then faded.

BROADWAY ICE was unhurried early steadily advanced on the backstretch while racing three wide angled out on the turn to gain command at the sixteenth
pole and just lasted. LOVETHATCAUSE pressed the pace from the two path lost the lead at the sixteen pole but came again and just missed. GIANT
INFLUENCE stalked the pace early and was checked going into the first turn then was allowed to settle three wide and raced evenly. TIGERBEACH set the
pace for the first three quarters then gave way. JACK BE QUICK reared in the gate before the start then chased the leaders but was not a factor.

the backstretch and failed to menace. BUCK DYNASTY pressed the pace and then gave way. DUTCHMAN was unhurried early and was not a threat.
PERFECT PARADE failed to menace. ONE KING CAT stalked the pace three wide and was through after a half. GET IT TO GEAUX not a factor. This race
