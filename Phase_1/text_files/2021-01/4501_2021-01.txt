continued along the inside, met bid entering the stretch and battled gamely to the sixteenth, and gave way late to lose second at wire. TOMASINO tracked
leaders in between rivals on the backstretch, entered turn three wide, drifted slightly into the stretch and launched bid in the four path, gained ground upper
stretch and flattened out late. SADDLE BAR tracked leaders in between rivals on the backstretch, entered turn two wide on and entered stretch within
range, lacked needed kick in lane and finished up evenly. PAPA CABALLERO off slow and settled off the pace in the two path on the backstretch, continued
along the inside on the turn and lacked rally in the stretch. BOUNTY HUNTER bumped at the start, tracked leaders along the inside on the backstretch,
entered turn along the inside, appeared to have trouble cornering and had to steady back, lacked rally after the trouble and eased in.

Footnotes
TWO BILLS pressed leader along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the rail on the turn, took aim along the rail at the top of the stretch, led at
the sixteenth pole and held. MR. ESKEN stalked pace along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the rail through the turn, angled out three wide in
upper stretch, surged late to get up for second. PETER ALAN slightly hopped at the start but did not affect much, led two wide on the backstretch, entered
turn two wide and drifted out into the stretch, overtaken for lead in upper stretch and gave way late to lose second. HARPER'S GEM came out at the start
three lanes, stalked leaders three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, entered stretch in the four path and kept on to best rest. SKY
GLORY stalked leaders in between rivals on the backstretch, entered turn two wide and failed to launch a rally in the stretch. SON OF A QUEEN three wide
early on the backstretch, angled to rail into the turn and settled well off the pace, entered stretch along the rail and never threatened.
