Footnotes
HUMPTY GRUMPTY took the lead while between horses approaching the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three
eighths pole, widened at the rail on the far turn, then steadily handled down the lane. LET'S GET STARTED settled off the earlier pace in the two and three
paths and raced outside into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn and got up for second later
yards. MIO BECOMING raced with the pace two deep and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened inside
the sixteenth pole. MY BOY STRYKER steadied lightly at the rail nearing the three quarter pole and settled off the pace, gave chase into the backstretch,
raced at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly down the lane. SEATTLE SAILAWAY raced well off the pace into the backstretch, bid only mildly and rounded
the far turn about the three path. ANOTHER MOVE saved ground. MIO D' EVEN rounded the opening turn in the four path and was outrun.

Footnotes
NO REGRETS rated close to the early pace inside, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole and took the lead about the three path midway on the far turn, dug in
from the top of the lane and drew clear later yards. THUNDER GRUNDER raced in the four path the first turn and entered the backstretch outside, started a
bid from the three eighths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn then dug in through the lane to share second at the wire. EASTPORT saved ground
through the first turn then eased out with a bid into the backstretch, raced near the rail on the far turn and held on to share second. A POWERFUL TALE set
the pace at the rail, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was caught at the rail midway on the far turn then flattened stride the final
furlong. UHWARRIE SKY settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the
far turn then flattened through the lane. AWESOME BUZZ stalked off the rail then challenged at the three eighths pole, dropped back off the rail on the far
turn and weakened in the stretch. IRISHTOWN rounded the opening turn in the six path and raced outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase from
the seven sixteenths pole, though, weakened in the seven path of the far turn. SAVE ME PAULA settled close to the pace in the three path of the first turn
but showed little response through the backstretch. BANISHMENT rounded the first turn about the six path then loped the course.

Footnotes
RYE STREET stalked off the rail then picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn just off the rail, dueled to the front
mid-stretch and drew away the final sixteenth. TAR HEEL PALACE rated the pace inside, came under pressure into the backstretch and contested the
advantage nearest the rail on the far turn, but was caught mid-stretch and weakened the final sixteenth. HICKORY MADE, racing without front shoes, raced
in the three path the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and
dug in down the lane to take third under the wire. BUSINESS CLASS rounded the opening turn about the four path then raced outside into the backstretch,
picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but was nipped from third
under the wire. MISS CHEENY raced well off the pace while saving early ground, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase leaving the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and finished evenly outside. SHEZA MEAN BROAD saved ground early and showed little response through
the backstretch. VENETIAN DRIVE was fatally injured shortly after the start and had to be euthanized on the track. The Stewards posted the inquiry before
this race was declared official.

Footnotes
MOTI saved ground off the early pace then bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead midway on the far turn, drew clear toward the head of the lane
and widened under strong hand urging. CRAZY IDEA settled off the early pace in the three path then eased out into the backstretch, bid approaching the
seven sixteenths pole, progressed steadily in the four path of the far turn and was along to take second the final yards. MY EMINENCE raced off the pace
and off the rail early on then eased out entering the backstretch, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and closed to the lead past the five sixteenths, but
was caught at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened stride the final sixteenth. THE WAYNE FACTOR settled off the pace inside, bid nearing the three
eighths pole but was roughed behind a narrowing opening past the five sixteenths pole, recovered stride into the far turn but showed little further. CENT
COMM saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and raced just off the rail on the far turn, though, showed little further.
VOODOO VALLEY raced well back saving early ground. CHUCK'S DREAM took over quickly and drew off to a long early lead, came under pressure
leaving the three eighths pole but was caught just inside the five sixteenths pole and faded readily. The Stewards posted the inquiry and reviewed a claim of
foul against the rider of My Eminence, lodged by the rider of The Wayne Factor, though, found insufficient evidence to make a change.

Footnotes
CLASSY ESCORT stalked two deep and moved to even terms inside the half mile pole, dueled from that point and raced two deep on the far turn, dug in
determinedly to edge out the runner-up past the sixteenth pole and was clear under the wire. SIGNATURE DISH rated a short lead inside, was met into the
backstretch and dueled from that point, contested the rail on the far turn but reluctantly yielded inside the sixteenth pole. HALF EMPTY settled off the pace
and off the rail the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, finished
well and was gaining on the top two. SARAH BELLUM saved ground well off the early pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn
just off the rail, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly to pass rivals. WATERLOO ROSE raced off the early pace in the two and three paths, picked
up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and showed little further. ZAP MAMA raced in the four path the first turn
then stalked three wide into the backstretch, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened stride.
DYNAMITE LADY raced in the five path the first turn and was not a factor. SHACKLETOWN settled off the early pace inside, picked up the chase nearing
the three eighths pole but faded past the pole.

LION LORD closed to the lead and tapered to the inside to rate the pace, turned back the challenge of Zaiza from the half mile pole, dueled clear midway on
the far turn and dug in under a steady drive to hold on. CAUSE FOR SURPRISE settled just off the early pace in the three and four paths, gave chase
nearing the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the four path of the far turn, dug in to take second mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner.
WASJUANNOWPAUL saved ground off the pace the opening turn then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved at the rail rounding the far turn and
dug in to take third the final yards. RELENTLESS STRIKE saved ground just off the pace the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid toward the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path but flattened stride later yards. MY BERNIE settled back in the three and four paths the first
turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and came through the far turn still about the four path, and passed a rival outside. ZALZA stalked two deep and
moved to even terms past the half mile pole, dueled from that point but dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened in the stretch. MACANAO saved
early ground and showed little response through the backstretch. FRENCH'S QUEST raced outside into the backstretch and showed little response.
MUNTIJ rounded the first turn about the five path and showed little response. THREE TO THIRTEEN settled off the pace about the four path the first turn,
picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded past the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
TECHNIQUE ONLY took quick control to rate the pace inside, dug in to the challenge of Bella Gianna nearing the three eighths pole and contested the edge
nearest the rail on the far turn, then dueled determinedly to hold off the stretch challenge of YOU CANT CATCH HER, who settled inside the first turn then
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and dug in a close stretch factor, but was outfinished the final furlong. SO
RED THE ROSE rounded the opening turn in the three path then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, came
through the far turn in the four path, eased five wide into the stretch and finished well to take third the final stride. MABEL raced just off the pace in the two
and three paths, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn in the three and four paths, finished evenly but was nipped
from third at the wire. BELLA GIANNA angled in to stalk two deep, challenged toward the three eighths pole and raced at a close disadvantage two deep
through the far turn, continued a factor to late stretch but flattened the final yards. OLD LINE MAGIC raced in the three path the first turn then picked up the
chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn still in the three path and finished evenly. WHOA BLACK BETTY saved ground well off the pace,
bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and finished evenly. RAISON D'ETAT GIRL rounded the first turn in the four path, raced
outside into the backstretch and showed little response. BOW DOWN TEWMEY saved ground through the opening turn, picked up the chase toward the
three eighths pole but faded approaching the far turn.

Footnotes
CRYPTOSONDE tapered to the inside past the five eighths pole and rated a slim lead, was met into the backstretch and dueled clear of Luca's Dream
nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and held well with steady encouragement. JACKLIGHTING saved ground close to the pace
the opening turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, though ultimately, settled for second.
THORN OF ROSE HILL rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths and raced well off the pace into the backstretch, bid nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and closed the gap to deep stretch, then taken in hand late. COCKY WINCHILL stalked three wide past
the five eighths pole, bid leaving the seven sixteenths, rounded the far turn off the rail and finished evenly. LUCA'S DREAM stalked two deep from the five
eighths pole and moved to even terms into the backstretch, engaged in close chase from that point but dropped back toward the five sixteenths, raced at the
rail on the far turn then weakened. WEAVING YOU BEHIND raced well back saving early ground, raced off the rail on the far turn and passed rivals in the
lane. IRON HENRY settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened in the three path of the far
turn. FORKS OF IVY showed little response through the backstretch. AMERICAN BAD BOY raced in the four path the first turn, picked up the chase toward
the seven sixteenths pole but faded through the backstretch.
