Footnotes
TALE OF V K, urged along the rail to gain terms with the first flight prompting the pace after the opening furlong, was eased back avoiding tight quarters
racing into the turn, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady response to wrest the advantage and go clear in the closing
stages under some left handed encouragement. MERMAID KISSES tracked off the first flight in the opening quarter, advanced to press the pace three wide
racing into the turn, gained a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. TREASURED INFO, urged
between foes disputing the pace, then inside rivals on the turn, faded leaving midstretch. PLAY THE MAX bobbled at the start, quickly recovered to press
the pace between foes through the backstretch into the turn and gave way leaving the furlong marker. WILDCAT MERRY tracked off the first flight racing
four wide to the turn and lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
MADAME MOON raced three deep to the first turn while dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to commence a steady
advance in that path racing into the far turn, wrested the advantage racing into upper stretch and went clear under firm encouragement.
HIGHRHYTHMDIXIE tracked the pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out nearing upper stretch while being
prompted to advance, was carried out by I AM A. LURING near midstretch but continued with a steady late response to prevail for the place honors.
TENERIFE MOON, restless in the gate prior to the start, was off slowly, then angled to the inside racing to the first turn, saved ground to upper stretch and
continued with a steady effort to improve position. I AM A. LURING broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage a bit off the rail racing to the far
turn, was headed racing into upper stretch and drifted out into a rival's path while giving way. NEW YORK COMMANDER tracked off the second flight
outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch but had no late kick. DEESSE tracked the pacesetter between foes in
second flight, came under pressure to advance nearing the far turn but had no closing response. BOOTSCOOTINSHUFFLE, restless in the gate before the

FLORIDA TWO STEP broke readily to gain a forward placing three deep attending the pace racing to the turn, advanced in that path nearing upper stretch
to challenge for command, quickly wrested the advantage to go clear under pressure leaving midstretch and was taken in hand nearing the wire once the
issue was decided. RICKY RUN settled inside foes dropping out last racing through the backstretch, shifted out nearing upper stretch to split foes three wide
and continued with a steady effort to edge a rival for the place honors. CONSILIUM tracked off the first flight in the opening stages, angled to the rail
entering the turn, saved ground to upper stretch steadily gaining position and just missed for second. LITIGANT, held up avoiding close quarters just after
the start, settled well outside foes racing to the turn, swung out six wide in upper stretch and passed some tiring rivals. MONEY HOUSE tracked off the first
flight four wide early, angled inwards racing into the turn but faded between rivals nearing the lane. FLYING BANKROLL, urged between foes to gain the
advantage, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing into the turn, dueled for command into upper stretch and gave way. DONEGAL ACES tracked off
the first flight five wide through the backstretch and gave way after a half. FELON, urged inside rivals prompting the pace racing to the turn, switched off the
inside nearing upper stretch and quickly emptied out.

Footnotes
DELAWARE DESTROYER broke outwards crossing the path of ONE MOST WANTED, was quickly righted to track off the first flight along the inside racing
to the first turn, shifted out three deep after a half gaining a position just off the leaders, contested the lead in that path between foes through the far turn to
upper stretch, edged forward to a narrow advantage in the lane and just held TOP BOMB under firm encouragement. The latter tracked off the first flight just
outside the eventual winner racing to the backstretch, was fanned four wide into the far turn while being prompted to advance, but continued with a steady
effort to the final stages to just miss. UNIDENTIFIED MAN angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted a bit off the rail
after a half while being prompted to advance inside foes, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, then came through close quarters between foes
to pursue the winner to late stages but couldn't gain even terms with the top pair. ONE MOST WANTED, cut off momentarily at the start, was settled along
the rail racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap. FLIPPING FUN hopped at the start,
angled inwards racing to the backstretch to make some brief progress along the rail, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to
advance between foes but had no final kick. OUR GREY GHOST settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. STAYIN OR
STRAYIN switched off the inside early while being urged to prompt the pacesetter into the backstretch, then to the far turn but came up empty racing into
the lane. POWERFUL MOON sped to the lead while angling to the rail leaving the chute, dueled for command inside a rival on the backstretch to the far turn
and gave way. GRAB THE CHANCE settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and dropped back early.

Footnotes
HOLIDAY CURLS tracked off the first flight between rivals under light rating racing through the backstretch while angling nearer to the inside approaching
the turn, shifted out to split foes three wide racing into upper stretch and wrested a clear advantage in time under brisk handling. PRINCESS JAVONCIA,
urged to the lead disputing the pace inside foes on a narrow advantage racing a bit off the inside into the turn, dueled for command between foes into the
stretch and prevailed for the place honors while failing to contain the winner. CSILLA angled to the inside in early stages tracking just behind the first flight,
came through to challenge inside the leader when presented an opening in upper stretch and just missed for second. RIDGELYSREDHOT, caught in close
quarters just after the start, was rated off the first flight racing four wide to the turn, shifted inwards racing into the stretch and continued evenly between
rivals in late stages. HONESTA tracked off the second flight along the inside in the opening half, shifted out to split foes racing into upper stretch and made
some belated progress to gain position. THE ROVING KIND, urged to a forward placing three deep tracking just off the leaders, was urged to lodge a bid
nearing upper stretch but came up empty racing through the lane. AMBER PRINCESS angled to the rail dropping off the second flight early, saved ground
to upper stretch but had no late response. LONG STORY SHORT, bumped soundly at the start, dropped out last early and never menaced thereafter. U S S
LOIS settled outside foes racing to the turn and never proved a serious threat. ONE SLICK FACT broke outwards bumping LONG STORY SHORT, was
righted to press the pace pace between foes racing to the turn but emptied out abruptly after three and half furlongs.

Footnotes
MISS TOURISTA was settled last while saving ground to the backstretch, shifted out nearing the far turn gathering momentum, rallied sharply four wide on
the far turn to upper stretch to wrest the advantage and kicked clear in the closing stages under firm handling. STORMY WAGER broke readily, shifted
inwards while being rated just off the leaders outside a rival racing to the backstretch, advanced on the first flight three deep after a half, shifted inwards
pressing the issue on the far turn to gain the advantage with a quarter mile to go but couldn't match the winner while proving best of the others. SPIN
CLASS angled to the rail tracking just off the first flight under light rating racing to the backstretch, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, shifted
out to split foes just off the inside entering the lane but was outkicked by the top pair. MAGIC SOLUTION tracked off the second flight outside rivals racing to
the backstretch, advanced three deep into the far turn to bid between foes nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the closing stages. WAR EMPRESS
tracked off the second flight inside foes to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch while being prompted to advance inside rivals but lacked the
needed final kick. LADY DOMINANCE, pulling against restraint between foes behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide
entering the lane, lost some momentum when her rider corrected her course and lacked the needed final bid. LOVELY LAURA, off a step slowly, was urged
three deep between foes to gain the lead leaving the chute, angled to the rail entering the first turn disputing the pace inside a rival, dueled inside foes into
the far turn and emptied out abruptly in upper stretch. AWESOME GAP, caught four wide racing through the chute while being urged to terms prompting the
pacesetter to the backstretch, was spent after a half.

Footnotes
SACRAMENTO Q ducked out at the start, was quickly righted to track just off the leaders four wide on the backstretch, advanced readily three wide entering
the bend to press the issue, dueled past midstretch and edged clear late under brisk handling. QUICK ENTRY, urged between foes through the backstretch,
then inside rivals disputing the pace entering the turn, contested the issue past midstretch but proved no match late. RIDE INTO THE SKY, urged to join the
pace three wide early, pressed the issue between foes to upper stretch but yielded to the top pair in late stages. HARD WEST shifted off the rail tracking off
the first flight inside foes racing to the turn, angled out four wide entering the lane but lacked the needed final kick. MR LIGHTNING BOY tracked off the first
flight between foes racing to the turn and emptied out into the lane. NOTACATBUTACARD, bumped at the start, switched out four wide racing through the
backstretch and faded racing into the turn. BETWEENHEREANDCOOL ducked out at the start bumping NOTACATBUTACARD, was righted, then urged to
brief contention inside rivals but was done early.

Footnotes
THE RIGHT STUFF (GB) angled inwards racing through the chute while being prompted to gain terms with a rival prompting the pace entering the first turn,
forced the issue nearing the backstretch to gain a clear advantage, held sway on a commanding advantage through the far turn to upper stretch and was
kept to firm encouragement to maintain a safe margin to the end. DEFERRED TAXES, caught in tight quarters, then squeezed between foes racing five
deep through the chute, was rated dropping off the second flight angling nearer the inside racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling for a
half, shifted out three wide on the far turn and made steady progress racing to the stretch to prove best of the others. FERMAT, caught in tight quarters,
then shuffled back racing through the chute, settled out of striking distance off the inside in the opening half, swung out four wide racing into the lane and
continued with interest to prevail for a share. CAPTAIN LAVA tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the far turn, was prompted to advance nearing
the lane but had no closing bid. LOWCOUNTRY tracked off the first flight inside rivals racing to the backstretch, lost some ground after a half, switched out
five wide entering the lane and made no real impression. KARNAK, urged along the inside racing to the first turn prompting the pace inside the eventual
winner, continued in pursuit of that rival to the far turn and gave way entering the lane. HARPOON HARRY, caught in tight quarters racing four deep
between foes leaving the chute, made brief progress three wide between foes to gain contention racing into the far turn but came up empty in late stages.
RUSH DELIVERY (IRE) settled near the inside early and failed to menace. TEMPO RUBATO proved no factor. NOTARY SOJAC hopped at the start, was
caught in tight quarters three deep between foes racing through the chute, shifted out four wide racing into the first turn while being prompted to contend but
gave way after a half.

Footnotes
ANTALYA was rated between foes tracking just off the first flight racing to the first turn while taking a firm hold, was prompted to advance three deep racing
into the far turn to bid for command nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage leaving the furlong marker and went clear under firm encouragement.
BLOODY MARY MORNIN, in touch with the first flight between rivals attending the pace racing to the backstretch, was prompted to duel for command while
shifting out racing into upper stretch but proved only second best. ELUSIVE RYDER settled well off the leaders angling to the rail, saved ground to upper
stretch, shifted out to split rivals just off the inside in late stages and continued willingly while missing for the place honors. SWEET STORY tracked off the
second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out splitting foes entering the far turn, shifted out to race three wide between foes in late
