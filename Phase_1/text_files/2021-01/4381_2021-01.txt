CENTRAL PARK pressed the early leader, moved up around the far turn to take command, raced four wide nearing the three sixteenths pole and was well
clear late under steady handling. DOODLE HOPPER was unhurried early on, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and was no match for the winner.
PINSON was slow in the early stages, moved up five wide nearing the eighth pole and had not enough in the drive. PROFESSIONAL stalked the early pace
while racing near the inside, raced in the two path through the stretch and had no response. TIZ APPROVED showed good speed while racing along the
inside and gave way. FEDERAL CASE dropped back early and failed to respond.

TEN MILES HIGH set all the pace along the inside and held gamely to be clear late under strong encouragement. TWO STEP DANCE pressed the early
leader, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and couldn't match strides with the winner through the stretch to finish second best. STOPIT stalked the
early pace, raced towards the inside and had no final winning bid. TITHED stalked the pace from the outside, raced four deep at the eighth pole and had no
late response. STRUM AND PLUCK was unhurried early on, raced three wide in the lane and failed to respond. ROGUE RAGE dropped back early, raced
four wide through the stretch and never was a factor. DENY settled off the early pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. CLEAR
WONDER saved ground and never was involved.

Footnotes
PRINCESS CORA was slow in the early stages, moved up along the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch and finished well to be clear late under
strong encouragement. BROADWAY PEGGY hopped at the break, moved up along the inside through the stretch and finished second best. SLEWYS
CHOSEN ONE showed good early speed to set all the pace, raced in the three path in the drive and weakened. KELCIE'S MANDATE was allowed to settle
early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. ORNERY ANGEL stalked the early pace, raced towards the inside throughout
and had no response. VANA GRAND was unhurried early on, raced along the inside through the lane and never threatened. MAHKATO pressed the early
leader and gave way. SPLENDOR BEACH dropped back early, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. PASSIONFORTREASURE
stalked the pace while racing four wide down the backstretch and failed to sustain a bid. DONNAMEUP failed to respond.

MIGHTY GHOST stalked the early pace while racing three wide down the backstretch, moved up three wide through the stretch to challenge the leader and
finished well to edge clear late under all out pressure. VALIANT VIRTUE showed good early speed from the inside, dug in past the eighth pole but couldn't
match strides with the winner late to be second best. SILVER EDGE showed good early speed to set all the pace while racing just off the inside and
weakened a bit through the drive. POCO CHARLIE was unhurried early, raced five wide at the eighth pole and had not enough late. HAY HAY MY MY
stalked the pace, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. HAPPINESS settled off the early pace, raced four wide at the three
sixteenths pole and never threatened. PREQUALIFIED raced towards the inside and failed to respond. SWAGSATIONAL was slow early and never
threatened.

Footnotes
DOUBLE BLESSED stalked the early pace, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and just got up in his final stride under strong handling. BIG BAD DIVA
pressed the early pace, raced three deep in the drive and finished gamely to the wire. REINA DEL SOL was shuffled at the break, moved up five wide
nearing the eighth pole and finished willingly to the wire. INFORMATION MOSAIC showed good early speed to set all the pace and weakened in the lane.
FUCHSIA was allowed to settle early, raced four wide through the lane and had not enough. CORE VALUES stalked the early pace, raced six wide into the
upper stretch and had no late response. NURSE RUBY raced towards the inside throughout and never was a factor. EVENTIDE (FR) dropped back early,
raced seven wide into the lane and never menaced. MODEST stalked the pace and weakened the final quarter of a mile. UPPER SPEED DS dropped back
early and failed to respond.
