Footnotes
BARISTA VIXEN coaxed from the gate, chased three paths off the inside in aim of the front, tucked inside through the turn, angled out nearing the quarter
pole and went seven wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just outside the eighth pole and drew clear under a drive to prevail getting geared
down in the late stages. MALIBU ANTHEM broke in at the start and was corrected, raced forwardly placed five paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked to the two path and applied pressure to the leader through the turn placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took over narrow command between
foes at that station swinging five wide into upper stretch, dug in and yielded at the three-sixteenths, kept on head to head with WICKED HAPPY and bested
that rival for the place honors. WICKED HAPPY six paths off the inside down the backstretch, pulled on the bit slightly in the clear, tucked three wide
through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, took brief narrow command at the three-sixteenths before
being displaced by the eventual winner and dueled to the finish with the aforementioned foe but was ultimately bested for the place honors while well clear
of the rest for the show. BOOM BOOM GIRL showed the way lightly coaxed four paths off the inside down the backstretch under some pressure from
ICANCEECLEARLYNOW early on, had that rival back away and was pressured by MALIBU ANTHEM through the turn, came under urging at the
five-sixteenths, yielded the front and went three wide for home, then tired in the stretch. CHEROKEE SONG coaxed from the gate, chased five to six paths
off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
tired. ICANCEECLEARLYNOW showed brief speed four paths off the inside applying pressure to the leader early on, backed away and tucked inside
through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
DUST DEVIL tipped into the four path stepping onto the backstretch, contently brought up the back of the pack for the initial half, was still in path four
entering the turn, flashed some interest as three-quarters was being rattled off, chose path five as the one to take entering the lane, by now under strong
encouragement, fought its way to the front end during the ensuing furlong, drew out to a comfortable advantage before getting geared down in the last
seventy yards. TIME TO TESTIFY patiently ridden keeping an eye on the pacesetter on the backstretch, inched his way to the outside springing from the
half mile pole, eventually managing to shoe-horn itself into path three in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, was immediately cued up, went into the
stretch, mustered up a response sufficient enough to claim the place. DANGEROUS EDGE along the outside, pursued the pace three wide on the turn,
unleashed a bold bid as the third fraction was being finalized, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail and full of momentum, saw the top one
assume the lead deep into the furlong grounds, kept up its fight in earnest for another sixteenth before flattening out. COLORMEPAZZI steadied after
coming in at the start, grabbed the advantage, cut over to the inside route, showed the way, pulling noticeably on the left, prompted by FIRST LINE, with
that one being three wide on the backstretch and then in path two on the turn, felt an uptick in pressure heading for the quarter pole, was let out in response,
got overhauled soon afterwards, backed away. MIAMI MUMBLES took up the chase two wide on the turn, with the rider urging the mount along on the turn,
was moved out into the five path from upper to midstretch, tired. FIRST LINE forwardly placed three wide for the opening half, cleared into the two path as
the half was being finished, applied some pressure on the ground-saving leader, came under a drive spinning into the lane, gave out.

DOCTOR K broke out at the start taking over the lane of the slower breaking STREETCAR JONES, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked
inside through the turn remaining patiently handled, took the inside route into upper stretch and got roused straightened away for home, went clear under a
drive and was geared down in the final sixteenth to the finish. TAPIT'S FLASHBACK broke in at the start bumping STREETCAR JONES, chased four then
three wide down the backstretch, came under coaxing four wide at the three-eighths, tipped five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one
while running on to secure the place honors. STREETCAR JONES broke a beat slow and was bumped by the aforementioned foe, chased six paths off the
inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from three furlongs out, swung four wide into upper stretch and improved
position for the show honors. MAGNIFICENT MAGS chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. AWESOME YET AGAIN five paths off the inside down the backstretch forwardly
placed, tucked to the two path through the turn, came under a ride five-sixteenths from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened. OUR
LUCKY MAN chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch, made no impact. DR.
GRUNSEICH chased three then two wide down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off
the inside for home and tired.

LETMETAKETHISCALL sparred for command outside TIMELY TRADITION, going about the task from path two on the turn, was coming up to the
three-sixteenths pole when called upon more, offered up the desired response, emerging at the eighth pole as the new and undisputed leader, steadily
added to the winning margin under good handling. TIMELY TRADITION put to a vigorous hand ride springing from the gate, out-sprinted MADAM MEENA
for the advantage, went over to the rail having been switched to much lighter handling, carved out the pace, attended by the winner from the outside, got set
down spinning onto the head of the stretch, relinquished by the furlong grounds, managed to save second. MADAM MEENA hustled from the starting gate,
saw the second place finisher assume the top, was then throttled down by a snug grip on the reins and maneuvered into the three path prior to departing the
backstretch, got roused coming approximately four wide into the lane, ventured onward down the middle of the strip, fell short of snagging away the place.
GYPSY JANIE three wide onto the turn, got sent out towards path five exiting it, launched no bids. LADY BY CHOICE spotted along the rail in rapid order,
went on to save ground to no avail.

MILLS six paths off the inside at the tail of the field, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into
upper stretch, closed well outside to take command inside the final sixteenth, then inched clear to the finish. SCARF IT DOWN chased three to four wide
briefly before tipping to the six path at the nine-sixteenths, went five wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced on the
front, swung four wide for home, dug in heads apart for command to the sixteenth pole when overtaken by the top one, ran on to best a rival for the place
honors. HOORAY FOR HARVEY vied from the four path outside a pair down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn and knocked heads with

knocking heads through the stretch, got overtaken in tandem with his main rival SCARF IT DOWN inside the sixteenth marker, ran on to the finish and was
ultimately bested for the place honors while clear of the rest. PLAYWRIGHT coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside, tipped to the two path placed to
coaxing at the three-eighths to move around a rival as COLTANDMISSISSIPPI backed up along the rail, took the inside route into upper stretch and kept on
for the last major share. FRANKIE BARONE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, weakened in
the late stages. REAL DAN chased four then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four to five wide for home and passed tired rivals.
HERO'S HOPE hustled from the gate, vied three wide with a flanking pair, dueled through the turn coaxed along near the quarter pole, yielded the front and
spun just off the inside for home, then weakened in the stretch. AUTOSTRADE four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun
three wide into upper stretch and weakened. ORPHEUS (ARG) broke in at the start bumping SUCCESSFUL SAINT, took the overland route chasing seven

CHATEAU angled sharply over to the inside after establishing control in short order, sailed along under a snug hold on a loosely-contested lead, was a short
distance beyond the three-sixteenths pole when called upon for more, left the eighth pole leading by its largest margin, saw the runner up chop it down more
than half, but held sway. SECRET RULES stalked the winner from the two path, went into the stretch, kept coming, gaining a good amount of real estate
late en route for the place. T LOVES A FIGHT worked its way into path four by the end of the backstretch, was in the same one spinning into the lane, had
enough of a stretch response to be along for third. MI TRES POR CIENTO (CHI) settled into midpack, underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn, stepped
as wide into the stretch, made no headway. FED FUNDS three wide onto the turn, got fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch, gained some, but
all accomplished without making any impact. COST BASIS sat loosely pocketed, got set down a few jumps shy of the quarter pole, tipped onto the two path
at the top of the lane, faltered. AJNADEEN brushed in the shadow of the starting gate, saved ground for nearly a half, got steered into the three path
heading for the three-sixteenths marker, launched no bids. PROMO CODE chased the pace from the two path after brushing with AJNADEEN at the start,
gave way.

Footnotes
BELLA AURORA brushed at the start by CALL ON MISCHIEF, who broke inwards, chased five then four paths off the inside down the backstretch at the tail
of the field, tucked inside through the turn, swung three wide into upper stretch, then took to the two path straightened away, rallied up the inside and took
command a furlong from home, inched away under a drive coming out slightly to the finish and prevailed safely on the wire. NEEDS SUPERVISION broke
out at the start brushing SAGUARO ROW, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
angled out four wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. SAGUARO ROW brushed at the start by NEEDS SUPERVISION, chased four
then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung five to six wide for home and kept on to secure the show honors. PORTAL CREEK hustled
from the gate, dueled early on with ALISIO, before chasing that rival when shaken off into the turn, came again to knock heads midway on the bend, took
over narrow command swinging four wide for home, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, weakened in the late stages. CALL ON MISCHIEF
broke in at the start brushing BELLA AURORA, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. ALISIO stumbled at the start, dueled early on with PORTAL CREEK before shaking that rival off briefly into the turn, had that foe advance once
more and knocked heads, yielded the front and spun three wide for home, then weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
HEY IT'S TATI remained forwardly placed after narrowly breaking on top, gradually made her way to the inside route, obtaining the goal by the half mile
pole, was held in reserve, at first showing the way accompanied by QUEENTIGUA from her outside, saw the second place finisher make it a three-way
tussle at the three-eighths pole, stepped into the lane still locked in battle and was turned loose, emerged at the eighth pole head to head with REMOANE,
with QUEENTIGUA having herself gotten squeezed back a few strides up the road, fought on with good determination to get the job done. REMOANE
stayed stationed in the three path after the field had been sent off and running, quickened after leaving the backstretch to join the pace dispute at the
three-eighths pole, saw the threesome vie on nearly even terms with each other until the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, lugged in a bit at that
station, resulting in the middle member of that trio, namely QUEENTIGUA, being pinched back and out her best stride, went at it one on one with the winner
from that juncture onward and wound up denied. MENZAMENZ at or near the two path for the opening half, swung into action by swinging out towards path
four for entrance into the stretch, came home well enough to be along for the show. QUEENTIGUA assumed a prominent position after bumping lightly with
SOPHIE FATALE, made it into the two path in time for the beginning of the run around the bend, was forced to dispute the pace from between opponents a
furlong later, once the runner up arrived on the scene, got called upon for more after settling in upper stretch, found herself pinched out contention soon
afterwards, got re-roused but failed to re-gain her prior response. JUDICIARY worked out a tuck into the two path at the top of the turn, angled one path
farther off the rail for the drive, made no headway. BIG RED GIRL strung out three to four wide on the bend, was more the latter stepping onto the head of
the stretch, tired. SOPHIE FATALE off a half beat the tardiest after making some contact with QUEENTIGUA at the start, travelled two wide on the turn,
shifted out into path five once in the stretch, launched no bids. LOVELEE HONOR the early trailer, was three wide and put to the whip by midpoint on the
turn, got sent out into path six from upper to midstretch, failed to make her presence felt. KARLA'S DREAM rode the rail, was put to a hard drive for a
furlong starting from the five-sixteenths pole, before being allowed to fade away afterwards.
