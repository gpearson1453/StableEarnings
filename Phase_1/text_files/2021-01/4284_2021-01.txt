Footnotes
ROCK ME was bumped hard at the start and forced into another rival, jostled with a foe early while taken under a tight hold, was rated just off the pace while
into the bit, made an outside bid at the seven-sixteenths, vied in the two path on the turn, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, bumped with CLUB SODA
while put to a drive in upper stretch, shook clear inside the furlong marker and proved best under strong urging. CLUB SODA showed good speed on the
outside then moved clear at the half-mile pole, vied inside of the winner while along the rail on the turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole, bumped with
the winner under a drive in upper stretch, battled with that foe into the final furlong and was outfinished while able to get the place. WARRIORS GEM broke
out and bumped soundly with a foe, jostled with that same foe early, showed speed then dropped just off the pace, raced inside early on the turn then
moved to the two path, shifted three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. CAYMANS COBRA stood in the gate and
was off very slow, was urged along towards the rear, raced inside to the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, had the rider lose his
whip late and lacked the needed response. ZENUCCI broke awkwardly and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, raced well back in the field, went
around the turn in the two path, moved out in upper stretch and failed to rally. CATALOGUE was bumped at the start and forced out, settled on the outside,
was asked three wide on the turn, chased four wide into the stretch and came up empty. PARK RIDGE BENNY acted-up just before the gate opened then
reared inward and hit the gate, came out very slow and had the rider lose his right iron and dangle over the left side of the horse, had the rider show
remarkable athletic skill to pull himself back into the center of the saddle then regained the right iron, spotted the rest of the field an enormous advantage,
went around the turn in the two path, moved out in upper stretch and never reached contention. RIV dropped back on the outside under urging, went three
then four wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to respond.

far turn then moved to the two path, was roused at the five-sixteenths, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead inside the
three-sixteenths, drew off under a solid hand ride into the final sixteenth then was eased in the final seventy yards while much the best. OFFSPRING was
hustled from the start, moved out into the first turn, raced in the three path on that bend, contested the pace on the outside, moved clear with a half-mile to
run, vied inside on the far turn, was asked once straightened for the drive, lost the advantage to the winner outside the furlong marker and proved no match
while clear for second. FORT POLK was forced out at the start, raced inside early on the first turn then moved to the two path, was well placed behind the
leading duo, went four wide on the far turn, was given he cue at the five-sixteenths, spun five wide into the stretch and came up empty. SCHIFF'S CORNER
broke out at the start then was asked, went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path under a snug hold, contested the pace on the inside of a foe,

Footnotes
KATIE THE CUTIE angled in while going to the front, set the pace in the two path, was challenged outside the quarter-pole then headed at the
three-sixteenths, came under a drive into upper stretch, shook off the runner-up into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong urging. SEE WHAT'S
WHAT went three wide on the first turn, tossed her head early on the backstretch, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the far turn,
made a bid outside the quarter-pole, took a short lead into the stretch, battled outside of the winner to the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while clear for
the place. BIG RED ROSE was last to commence, went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was urged two then three wide on the far
turn then driven four wide into the stretch, chased outside into the final sixteenth, drifted out late and lacked the needed kick while able to secure the show.
CHRISTEANA'S KISS saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused while inside on the far turn and lacked the needed response.
GLANCE went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged three then four wide on the far turn, dropped to the three path into the stretch and
also lacked the needed response. MARRAZANO went three to four wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, came under urging while five wide on the
far turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and had nothing left. LIMAGE stumbled at the start but broke with the body of the field, went around the first turn
in the two path, was rated off the pace, chased in the four path on the far turn then came five wide into the stretch and capitulated. WAR BANDIT tossed her
head briefly early, went three wide on the first turn, moved out entering the backstretch, was reserved near the rear, moved from three to five wide on the far
turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and was no factor. LUCKY DARE went four wide on both turns and faltered.

five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. FLASH ATTACK rounded the first turn in

four wide to make a bid on the far turn, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, spun five wide into the stretch then shook clear at the three-sixteenths and
held under steady urging. CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT broke in and was off a step slow, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was roused
while two then three wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch under a drive, gained outside in the final furlong and finished with good courage but
missed while clear for the place. THE GREEN MO'STER went around the first turn in the three path, stalked the pace on the outside, drew even with the
leader in the two path on the far turn, vied between horses from the three-eighths to near the quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and
was outfinished while able to get third. EPIC (ARG) was asked leaving the gate and went to the front, raced in the two path on the first turn, set the pace
