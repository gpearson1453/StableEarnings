KNOCKOUT PUNCH five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home, rallied to take command a furlong
out, dug in gamely tussling with the runner up before inching away at the end to prevail. DEMOCRATIC VALUES vied from the five path among a quartet
early on before chasing latched on with a pair in behind the leader into the turn, tucked to the two path through the bend coming under coaxing near the
quarter pole, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, took over command straightened away, dug in and was collared a furlong out, fought on to
the finish to be along well clear of the rest and second best. OUCH OUCH OUCH four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path
through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung two to three wide for home and improved position to secure the show honors. KITH
struck the near side stall at the start, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the
seven-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and passed tired rivals. CAMOUFLAGED KISSER vied early on from the three path inside a trio before chasing
inside a pair tucked to the inside through the turn, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, went three to four wide into upper stretch and tired.
SCORPION DYNASTY vied three to four paths off the inside with a trio before emerging with sole command nine-sixteenths from home, showed the way in
hand tucked to the inside through the turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, yielded the front straightened
away and tired. JOYCEE HAZ PIZZAZ vied early from the six path outside a trio before giving chase outside a pair from the nine-sixteenths, tucked three
wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, began to fade near the quarter pole and went three wide into upper stretch, the rider was in
the midst of tucking the whip away to the off side when losing the handle on it near the eighth pole, then got eased through to the finish.

Footnotes
LEFT LEANING LUCY away alertly, saw the pilot take hold shortly afterwards, led the way on the backstretch, pressed by CHARLOTTE WEBLEY from the
outside, cut over sharply to the rail stepping onto the top of the turn, continued on the front end, rider yet holding something in reserve and with the
aforementioned foe resuming its role of being the primary pursuer, began to edge clear as the second split was being finalized, struck the three-sixteenths
marker and got turned loose, responded and opened up, was still well ahead when geared down for the final seventy yards. MEBS WEB rushed up with a
burst of momentum nearing the end of the backstretch, departed it from three path, kept watch on the disputed pace within striking distance, tipped out one
path farther off the rail coming into the stretch, got staved off. TUFF BIRD got going in short order after brushing with WINGS OF FIRE in the shadow of the
starting gate, chose the two path as the one to take on the turn, got cued up angling three wide onto the head of the stretch, altered course into path five a
few strides down the road, ventured onward with enough energy to earn the show. HEARTSTRINGS two wide onto the turn, fanned out into path six from
upper to midstretch, made no headway in the final furlong. MANI PEDI took up position in midpack, travelled two to three wide on the turn, swung out four
wide into the stretch, had no closing punch. GAGLIANO sluggish early, went about the turn from path two, got sent out towards path six during the early
stages of the stretch run, made no impact. ELITE SPEED parked out four wide on the turn, shifted towards path five for the drive, had no offering.
CHARLOTTE WEBLEY outside the winner, pressed the issue for the opening half, stationed in the two path on turn, was under a drive going into the lane,
folded. WINGS OF FIRE eyed the pace from the pocket after making light contact with TUFF BIRD at the start, steadied as the winner was getting
maneuvered onto the inside route right near the half mile pole, stepped into the stretch and faltered. PRINCESS IN CHARGE sighted along the rail on the
turn, moved onto the two path entering the stretch, came up empty and backed away.

Footnotes
MONEY RIDE five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four to five wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong knocking heads with the runner up and was up in the
final jumps to the finish. INSTINCTIVE RHYTHM five then four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home, rallied to
take command a furlong out, dug in under threat to the outside battling on to the finish but was caught in the final strides. TOOK CHARGE hustled from the
gate, showed the way coaxed along in the two path, came under increasing pressure through the turn and spun three wide into upper stretch brushing his
main pace rival straightened away, dug in under threat and relented near the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. MORNING BREEZ chased two
to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole, then flattened out
in the late going. THE SICARII coaxed from the gate, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn,
angled four to five wide for home and weakened. REJECTED AGAIN hustled from the start, prompted the leader from the four path down the backstretch
coaxed along, tucked three wide through the turn and intensified the pressure through the bend, swung four wide into upper stretch and was brushed
straightened away by TOOK CHARGE, got shaken off and tired.

Footnotes
JUDGE ALEXANDER was maneuvered into the path three prior to departing the backstretch, picked up interest late on the bend, angled five wide spinning
onto the head of the stretch, closed in on fresh leader RINGGOOD, wore that one down in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole and edged away. RINGGOOD
within striking distance, began the run around the turn towards the two path, dove onto the inside route to time to cut the corner into the lane unobstructed,
went into the three path during the next sixteenth while being roused along, arrived at the eighth pole with the winner having announced its presence, shied
out a bit from the whip afterwards attempting to turn back JUDGE ALEXANDER, yielded with approximately a sixteenth remaining, had no trouble salvaging
second. STARSHIP EMPIRE chased the pace two to three wide on the turn, played some follow the equine maneuvering over to the rail late on the bend,
right after the top one began to do so himself, stepped into the lane and launched a rail bid sufficient enough to secure the show. Z'FINALE off the inside,
was under a ride racing three wide on the turn, commenced the stretch a couple of paths farther off the rail, mustered up a mild response for the last major
check. WHATS IN IT FOR ME forwardly placed four wide, issued his best bid turning into the lane, wasn't up to the task at hand and gave way.
THEITALIANAMERICAN saved ground for nearly six furlongs, shifted into the four path from upper to midlane, made no impact. RATCHET rushed up to the
front end, showed the way from path two, prompted by SECOND FORTUNE from the outside, gave it to heavy pressure as three-quarters was being
completed, made it into the lane and steadily retreated. SECOND FORTUNE three wide on the turn, prompted the pace for six furlongs and folded.
MARINER QUI faltered after undergoing a ground-saving journey.

a threesome for command for a majority of the opening half, snatched away the advantage as the half was being completed, confidently handled, was
coming up to the furlong grounds when asked for more, gave the desired response to win by daylight. JILL'S A HOT MESS shifted into the two path early
holding a slim advantage, was forced to fend off a pair of opponents parked out to her outside, was already being necked by the winner when called upon
for more coming into the lane, haplessly watched BREAKFASTATBONNIES draw off, managed to salvage second. HANDLE THE TRUTH chased the pace
approximately three wide on the turn, swung into the lane towards the same path, gained ground well to get up for the show. KNOW IT ALL RED briefly
urged from the gate, took up position in midpack, travelled three wide on the turn, was slightly closer to the rail entering the stretch, flattened out late.
GRACEFULLY WILD three wide onto the turn, angled five wide exiting it, weakened in the final furlong. EMPIRES FIRST LADY sent over to the rail at the
half mile pole, went on to be the lone ground-saver in the contest, made no impact. HIP NUMBER ONE strung out three to four wide on the turn, fanned out
into path six for the drive home, made no headway. NO PAYNE disputed the pace towards path three, between rivals for much of the opening half, got
asked in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, went into the stretch and soon backed away. NEBO along the outside, chased the pace four wide on
the turn, never made its presence felt.

Footnotes
PERCEIVED settled in hand three to four paths off the inside in behind a quartet battling for command up top, went five wide through the turn and advanced
through the latter portion to issue a challenge swinging five wide into upper stretch, seized command straightened away, drew clear under a drive and was
geared down in the late stages. DIANNESIMPAZIBLE just off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn coaxed along from
the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. JERUSALEM
GATES vied three then two wide with a trio to his outside, shook off each rival one by one inside the three-eighths, came under challenge by the top one
nearing the quarter pole and floated four wide into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and weakened while along for the show honors. FOTIS
got away to a tangled beginning breaking inwards and brushing the gate, then being steadied when losing his lane to rivals, chased six to seven paths off
the inside detached at the tail of the field, tucked two to three wide through the turn, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and offered up late foot to
close in by tired rivals and procure the last major share. COLORMEPAZZI vied with a trio to his inside while six then five wide, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened. KINGFISH got brushed at the start by FOTIS, chased three wide until tucked inside half a
mile from home, came under coaxing midway on the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. SHADOW CASTER chased
three wide down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired. FIRST LINE
veered in at the start and was corrected, vied four then three wide between foes among a quartet, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got steadily
shaken off through the latter portion of the turn, spun just off the inside for home and folded. SIXTO vied five then four wide between foes among a
foursome knocking heads for command, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, was gradually shaken off through the latter portion of the turn, cornered
three wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
PETE'S PLAY CALL away in good order, sparred for command from the two path, was put to a drive taking over as the half was being rattled off, shifted one
path farther off the rail settling into upper stretch, edged away from the competition, held on with willingness to turn back STAN THE MAN. STAN THE MAN
at a considerable distance from off the inside throughout, was allowed to settle into stride on the backstretch, raced two to three wide on the turn, fanned out
into path six from upper to midlane, becoming the widest of all, got staved off. DRAFTED coaxed along in the two path keeping an eye on the contested
pace, got driven four wide into the lane, proved no match for the top twosome. MY BOY TATE underwent a three wide pursuit, got set down late on the
bend, was sent out five wide for the drive, gave way. HAPPY FARM secured control shortly after the field had been sent off and running, showed the way,
accompanied by the winner from the winner, got put to the test nearing the quarter pole, gave in then steadily backed away down the stretch.
