Footnotes
J J'S CROWN was up close early, went four wide into the turn, took a brief lead in mid stretch, drifted out and held. SUPERDUTY JUSTICE pressed the
early pace from off the rail, was eased back into the turn, angled out in early stretch and just missed. BECKHAM JAMES was unhurried early, circled seven
wide through the turn, was closing late and needed more ground. CATASTROPHIC FORCE tracked the early pace, went five wide out of the turn, was up
close to the winner and weakened late. WHO'S CHEATIN WHO was void of speed and was no factor. EL CACHETON was allowed to settle early, loomed
six wide into the turn and flattened out. TRACK BOUND stalked the early pace from the inside and faded. MARQUE IT UP set a pressured early pace from
between rivals and faded.
