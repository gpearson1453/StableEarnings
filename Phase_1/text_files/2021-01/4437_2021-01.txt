Footnotes
ALEX'S STRIKE carried out at the break, raced back early as a result, moved out and swept up toward the fore while four wide late in the turn, challenged
on the outside nearing the furlong marker, kicked well clear under steady handling. ITS MY BAG BABY back off the pace, saved ground when moving closer
through the turn, proved no match for the winner the final furlong, edged clear for the place. ROGALLO in the second flight early while between fast,
steadied from between horses midway on the turn, fell back slightly, staged a mild rally in the drive to be along for the show. CHITTO lacked speed outside,
raced four wide out of the turn when improving into the lane, flattened out in the final furlong. COWBOY TUFF dueled up front while racing in the two path,
weakened in the drive. YAMANO MAKER (JPN) narrowly set the pace along the inside for a half then also faltered when the real running began at the head
of the lane. TOUGH COMPANY in the main body while racing outside, continued four wide through the turn, came up empty in the drive. TICK TACK MO
raced three wide and in the second group for the drive, also failed to respond when called on turning for home. STASH THE CASH void of speed, came five
wide into the stretch, failed to rally. HAMAZING SONG broke out, was straightened, chased the two leaders into the turn, gave way soon after. HESLUCK
off a couple of steps slow, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
KNIGHT'S CROSS forwardly placed toward the inside, was boxed in when inching closer to the leader far turn, asked along and split foes to challenge late
in the final bend, put a head in front when straightened for home, headed furlong out, spirited duel to the wire, came back to narrowly prevail in game
fashion. GAMBLER'S FALLACY broke back, lacked early foot as a result, rallied four wide out of the final turn, put a head in front past the furlong marker,
raced on equal terms with the winner inside that one the final furlong, outkicked late to narrowly miss. EGO settled off the pace and the inside early,
improved inside of several rivals exiting the final turn, lacked a further advance but proved well clear of the others. CALIFORNIA SWING void of speed for
four furlongs, improved with a four out to five wide middle move through the turn, flattened out in the drive. EPIC (ARG) void of speed, between rivals into
the far turn, two path into the lane, improved through some traffic through the lane while not a serious threat. DRIVEN TO COMPETE broke alertly, set the
pace along the inside, faltered. PICKFORD three wide when off the pace in the first turn, continued outside, came up empty for the drive. MAJESTIC
JOHN'S tired while racing toward the inside. SHWEET PERSUASION away in good order, pressed early, moved up to duel the middle half, gave way in the
drive. POTOMAC off a step slow, was finished after a half.

outside, five wide into the turn, backed up in the drive. ALL STAR RED void of speed, was not a factor inside. MINE MY TIME remained always back.
EASTER MUSIC bothered and carried out at the break, raced four wide, tired in the drive to finish far back.

Footnotes
JALEN JOURNEY closest to the leader for a half off the inside, collared that one when straightened for home, drove well clear. TOWN CHAMP broke
alertly, showed the way up the backstretch inside, briefly shook clear late in the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, dug in late to prove game
for the place. THOMAS SHELBY back off the early pace, in some traffic late in the turn, moved out a bit for the drive, not enough for the place late. GORDY
FLORIDA in the second second flight off the inside, three wide into the lane, lacked a late punch. IMPRESSED within striking distance along the inside,
came up empty for the drive. CHAMPAGNEONME void of speed, three wide through the turn, made little impact through the lane. AWESOME GENT
forwardly placed outside, four wide turning for home, gave way in the drive. EASY SHOT off a step slow, trailed in the two path throughout.

Footnotes
OUTASITE away in good order, set the pace along the inside firmly in hand, continued in hand through the turn, let out a notch in upper stretch, maintained
a daylight advantage to the wire under a steady right handed stick. NAME REJECTED in mid pack while racing outside, four wide exiting the turn when
moving within striking distance, could do little with the winner late, proved determined for the place spot. STILLETO BOY prompted the pace while racing off
the inside, also was not a match for the winner, outkicked for the second spot while inside the runner up. MACRON off a step slow, moved up to mid pack,
improved nearing the furlong marker then flattened out a bit to finish up evenly. TEST OF WILL off slowly to trail early in spotting the field a couple of
lengths, moved out and advanced with a solid middle move while five wide through the turn, flattened out a bit in the drive while remaining outside. RAM
lacked speed, raced in the two path when well off the pace turn, lacked a serious response when called on for the drive. HEARTBREAKER broke slowly,
continued to race back through the turn toward the inside, passed some tiring foes in the drive to improve a bit, not a serious threat. BAMALAMA forwardly
placed early along the inside, continued to prompt the issue while boxed in along the rail late on the backstretch and through most of the turn, weakened in
the drive. DEVIL'S TOWER forwardly placed for a half off the inside, gave way in the drive. STREET TOLL remained back while racing five wide into the
stretch. BIG IN THE CITY fell back, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
SILVER STATE last to leave, moved closer three wide into the first turn, raced unhurried early on the backstretch, called on for some run in the far turn,
moved up steadily in the three path through the final turn, hooked up with the runner up entering the stretch, fully extended under brisk handling to narrow
prevail. HUNKA BURNING LOVE broke on top, set the pace just off the inside, responded when the winner came alongside when straightened for home,
proved stubborn to the end. NIGHT OPS void of speed while saving ground early, moved out to be in the two path far turn, emerged from between foes late
to annex the show, no threat to the top two. NIFTY settled off the pace and the inside, raced four wide through the final turn, mild late interest while
remaining widest of the next flight, outkicked for the show. PIONEER SPIRIT crossed out to the two path into the first turn while closest to the runner up,
continued to pursue that one up the backstretch and into the far turn, came up empty for the drive. FULL AUTHORITY chased the runner up into the first
turn along the inside, began a steady retreat before a half, trailed home.

Footnotes
SWIFTSURE broke with the early leader, chased that one up the backstretch and into the turn, advanced and took over in the two path turning for home,
shook clear, held sway late while being kept to task. SIR WELLINGTON settled off the pace inside, continued inside early turn, moved out in the two path
turning for home, proved not a match for the winner late, up in the place in the final strides. BOB'S EDGE in the second flight while in the three path, moved
closer while remaining closer in the three path turning for home, could not match the winner late, caught for the place in the waning strides. TWILIGHT
BLUE back off the pace inside, moved out a bit for the drive, slowly closing for the show with some mild late interest while out in the strip. JOE FRAZIER
went one paced throughout while racing three wide. ONCOMING TRAIN off the pace outside, four wide through the turn, lacked a serious response. LOCK
UP broke on top, got well clear soon after, continued to show the way up the backstretch and into the turn through some quick fractions, gave way when
confronted turning for home. EUROCHIPPYGOLFER void of speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a factor. CAUSEWAY JONES tired while
racing three wide. SOUND THE CHARGE remained always back while racing off the inside.

Footnotes
GETRIDOFWHATAILESU unhurried early along the inside, moved out for the run into the far turn, encountered some traffic late in that bend, moved to the
outside for the drive, closed with a rush when clear to win going away. OUR SUPER FREAK forwardly placed off the inside, stalked in the run up the
backstretch, challenged three wide in the second turn, continued to vie into upper stretch, proved no match for the winner late while holding sway for the
place. ISTAN COUNCIL settled off the pace and the inside, moved closer in the second turn, lost contact with the top two the final furlong while prevailing
for the show spot. CHANCE TO SHINE void of early foot while toward the inside, closer late in the second turn in some traffic, moved out, set down when
straightened for home, altered course to the inside a furlong out when continuing in traffic, mild late interest to miss the show spot. WICKED WHISPER
away well, showed the way along the inside into and through the first turn, dueled the middle half while remaining closest to the rail, continued to vie into the
lane, faltered the final furlong. FIGURE IT OUT within striking distance just off the inside, had little left for the drive. HIS GLORY remained back in failing to
menace. GRAYSONSMACHO GAL broke sharp, pressed the issue early off the inside, dueled in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, gave way
from between foes exiting that bend. BLESSED AGAIN raced in mid pack off the inside, three wide through the final turn, tired in the drive. REGAL BEAUTY
off a step slow, failed to menace after a wide trip. VAULT unprepared at the start while tossing her head, dwelt, pulled up opening quarter, walked off.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
WINDMILL popped the start, took command inside, rated into the turn, shook off the runner up turning for home, drew well clear and was not threatened to
the wire. MARION FRANCIS also broke in good order, chased the winner while outside that one up the backstretch, moved slightly closer late in the turn
then proved no match in the drive, clearly second best. PRINCESS LEA back off the pace while racing outside, asked along late in the turn, no match for the
top two, finished up best of the rest. GRACE'S SECRET void of early foot outside, came four out to five wide into the lane, displayed some mild interest
down the middle of the strip to improve position. LA PULCINELA turned in an even effort while racing off the inside. MISS TULSA void of speed, saved
ground into the turn, moved out a bit for the drive, improved position. GRAVITRON within striking distance toward the inside, came up empty the final
furlong. CHURCH SERVICE bumped start, trailed early, passed tiring rivals while not a serious threat. CATALAN settled in mid pack, had nothing left for the
drive. FORCE OF NATURE bumped at the start, four wide into and through the turn, no threat. SEEKING HONOR forwardly placed, began a steady retreat
before a half.
