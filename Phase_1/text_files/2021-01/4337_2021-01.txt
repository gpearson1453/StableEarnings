ARABIAN STORY was allowed to settle off the pace, loomed six wide through the turn, took control in upper stretch and drew off as an easy winner.
HERZEN raced in mid pack early, went four wide into the turn, was no match late and finished second best. INDY MOON was void of speed, circled seven
wide through the turn and was along for third. YHA YHA was outrun early, went five wide into the turn and offered no late rally. HEAVY FAVOR set a clear
early pace from off the rail and weakened. WILDLY AWESOME was unhurried early, raced along the inside and was never a factor.

PULPIT was unhurried early, raced seven wide through the turn, was gaining late and finished second best. SWEET REGARDS set a pressured early pace
from off the rail, opened up in mid stretch, drifted in and faded late. NAVARONES SPARKLE was taken back early, raced between rivals, angled out in the
stretch and finished belatedly. HOMEMADE LOVIN raced in mid pack, raced eight wide out of the turn and was empty late. LETHAL ENTITY stalked the
early pace, went three wide into the turn and gave way. WHAT'S THE DEAL was void of speed and was no factor. LAURA BELLE pressed the early pace,
went five wide into the turn, angled in and weakened.

Footnotes
BLOW MY MIND pressed the early pace, went six wide into the turn, drifted in and held for the win. OLYMPIC EXPRESS was unhurried early, waited
behind rivals into the turn, angled out in early stretch, was gaining late and needed more ground. CONQUEST SMARTEE forced the early pace, raced off
the rail into the turn, fought gamely and weakened late. CIMPL MAN was taken back, made a middle move along the inside and flattened out late.
TOMAHAWK TUESDAY was void of any speed circled eight wide through the turn and passed tired rivals. LOVER BOY BOB was allowed to settle early,
went three wide into the turn and never fired. STREAKS BRO tracked the early pace, raced seven wide and never fired. FAMOUS ROCK STAR set a
pressured early pace from between rivals and tired. Hand timed.
