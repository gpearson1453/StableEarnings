Footnotes
ARTICULATOR was allowed to settle early, loomed six wide into the second turn, took control at the quarter pole, drifted out late and edged clear for the
win. ARIZONA MOON was void of any early speed, went three wide into the second turn, angled out in early stretch, was no match late and finished second
best. BLACK OPS was unhurried early, circled eight wide through the second turn, drifted in late and was up for third. QUINCY EXPRESS pressed the early
pace, went three wide into both turns, drifted in stretch and weakened. THUNDER DOME was taken back early, went seven wide through the second turn
and never fired. DARNQUICK tracked the early pace, went five wide into the second turn and was empty late. MR RIGHT NOW raced in mid pack early,
went seven wide into the second turn, drifted in late and offered no late rally. RAMBLIN' MAN set a pressured early pace, went four wide into the second
turn and was finished early. NUMBER THREE LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST NUMBER SEVEN CLAIMING INTERFERENCE IN EARLY STRETCH,
BUT THE STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.
