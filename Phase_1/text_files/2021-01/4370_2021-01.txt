Footnotes
POLICY tracked the pace off the inside, went three to four wide around the turn, rallied four wide in the drive and bested the runner-up. DESMOND DOSS
broke in and brushed rival, angled to the outside and was sent to a forward position, went three wide into the lane, drew alongside the leader in upper
stretch, led briefly past the eighth pole but was outkicked by the winner. I WILL NOT broke out and bumped rival, chased two then three wide around the
turn and finished willingly to earn the show. SHADY EMPIRE set the pace between rivals, held a short lead to the furlong marker, lost command soon after
the eighth pole and yielded to a minor award. EL DIABLO ROJO brushed leaving the gate, went two wide into the turn, angled out and came four to five
wide into the stretch, chased within striking distance in the drive but needed to find more late. JETOVATOR pressed the leader from inside up the
backstretch, chased that foe around the turn and into the drive and finished evenly along the fence. AGAMEMNON chased along the inside to the lane and
never produced a bid. AFTERNOON HEAT traveled near the back of the pace, took the turn two wide, angled out in the stretch and never threatened.
RINSE AND REPEAT saved ground into the lane and was never a factor. BRACE FOR IMPACT bumped leaving the gate, pressed the pace three deep,
continued to apply pressure from outside around the turn, then weakened in the lane. ASARO raced off the pace, came three wide into the lane and proved
no menace.

Footnotes
BURNIN TURF stumbled leaving the gate, angled to the inside early, moved out around the first turn and went outside the leader into the backstretch,
chased foe to the far turn, bid outside near the three-eighths pole, cleared foe in upper stretch, then held late under a drive. MAMBA COOL tucked inside on
the first turn, stayed inside then moved into the two path around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, closed well and gained second while gaining on the
winner. SECRET CLUB went two wide around the first turn then went between foes, steadied off heels past the five-eighths pole, went up between another
pair of foes to close the gap on the leader, entered the stretch two wide, drifted in and bumped rival upper stretch, gained ground late but got edged for the
place. TALLEMARK sped to the front and crossed over to the inside, met bid around the far turn, held a short lead into the drive, lugged in and brushed the
rail past the three-sixteenths pole, then flattened to a minor award. CRANKIN stalked the pace from inside, saved ground to the stretch, bumped by rival in
upper stretch and kept on through the late stages. FLY BUDDY FLY stalked off the inside then three deep, asked three wide around the far turn and
weakened. BIG BILLY traveled three wide around the clubhouse turn then three deep into the backstretch, went three wide around the second bend and
had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
MISTER BOLD stalked the pace along the rail, tipped out in upper stretch, bid alongside the leader at the eighth pole, surged clear and drew away to the
wire. TETON VALLEY dueled with outside rival into and around the turn, cleared foe at the top of the stretch, led to the eighth pole but proved no match for
the winner. SWIFT AS I AM tracked between rivals, two wide exiting the turn, lacked room into the stretch, angled out and kept on to gain the show.
SHIMMER ME TIMBERS stumbled leaving the gate then broke out and bumped rival, dueled for the lead from outside into and around the turn then gave
way. PAPPY BOYINGTON raced off the pace, went four wide around the turn, came out into the stretch, checked off heels in upper stretch and never
rallied. MY MAN BAGS broke in, settled off the leaders, saved ground from inside and never rallied. HOT BOX bumped leaving the gate, chased three deep
then moved out in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
LEGGS GALORE set the pace inside, inched away in upper stretch and widened in the final furlong. NARDINI bobbled crossing surfaces then came in and
bumped rival soon after, settled off the inside, raced outside a rival on the turn then angled out into the stretch and bested the rest. WARREN'S SHOWTIME
broke in and bumped rival leaving the gate, bumped by NARDINI early, raced off the pace, entered the turn two wide then angled out into the drive and
rallied for the show. SHE'S DEVOTED stalked along the inside, a bit off the rail into the stretch, went around rival near the sixteenth pole and lost the show.
HOMEHOME traveled mid-pack up the backstretch, took the turn two to three wide, angled out at the top of the lane and evened out in the final furlong. MO
SEE CAL forwardly placed outside a pair of foes then three wide into the turn, angled in a path and took aim two wide into the stretch but weakened in the
final furlong. FLORENTINE DIAMOND stumbled leaving the gate, recovered to chase up close outside the pacesetter, went two wide around the turn and
weakened in the drive, then was vanned off following the race. HOLLYWOOD HILLS bumped at the start, tracked from inside, steadied at the three-eighths
pole, remained inside to the stretch and had no response when called upon. SHEZA GIRLY GIRL bumped both sides at the start, trailed up the backstretch,
exited the bend two wide and never made an impact.

Footnotes
BRICKYARD RIDE had early speed and came in early, sped clear up the backstretch, led two wide into the lane, drifted in upper stretch then drew away.
TIGRE DI SLUGO raced off the pace along the inside, checked into the turn, moved into the two path around the bend, then rallied in the stretch and
finished strong along the inside to earn the place. FASHIONABLY FAST chased the pace two wide, three wide into the stretch, finished willingly and missed
the place. LOUD MOUTH bumped with inside rival and checked early, stayed in range off the rail, came four wide into the stretch and kept on willingly in the
final furlong. JAMMING EDDY stalked off the rail, two to three wide around the turn and weakened. CLUB ASPEN trailed the field early, took the turn two
wide and improved position. ROOKIE MISTAKE went two wide into the turn, angled out around the turn, came five wide into the stretch and never made an
impact. OLIVER traveled at the back of the pack, went four to five wide around the turn, angled inside a rival then came out to race wide into the lane and
was never a factor. PEACEFUL TRANSFER off the pace in the early going, entered the turn three wide, exited six wide and proved no menace. PSYCHO
DAR bumped and forced in early, chased off the rail then four wide into the drive and weakened. BETTOR TRIP NICK forced in early, chased along the
inside and tired. PEACEFUL TRANSFER raced as ROYAL TRUMP.

Footnotes
SQUARED SHADY showed speed from inside, set the pace with company to the outside, cleared rival at the quarter pole and drew away. ANOTHER
EDDIE pressed the leader from outside, lost contact approaching the quarter pole, chased off the rail into the lane and proved second best. WARRIOR
LADY stalked the speed up the backstretch, steered down to the rail, saved ground and cut the corner into the stretch and held the show. PISTACHIO
PRINCESS off slow to begin, chased inside to the lane then tipped out and showed a mild response to earn a small award. MISS BAYLEE forwardly placed
outside rivals, took the turn four wide and weakened. OMG IT'S JESSICA tracked between foes, steadied at the seven-sixteenths pole, entered the turn
three wide, angled five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. CURIOUS INJI up close outside the leader early while inside a pair of rivals, lost ground
into the turn, exited the bend two wide and faded. GALARINA hesitated and broke slow, angled in on the turn and passed tired foes. ANNIETOWN settled
off the inside, went three wide around the turn and never responded to urging. RACE JUDICATA took the turn three to four wide and weakened. SUGAR
KISSES off the pace in the early going, entered turn four wide, then exited five wide and made no impact.
