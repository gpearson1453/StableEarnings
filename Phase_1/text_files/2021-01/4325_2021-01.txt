Footnotes
BLANK IT was allowed to settle early, went six wide into turn, was gaining late, took control late and edged clear. ROMAN RUSH stalked the early pace,
raced along the inside and finished evenly. CREATIVE ART tracked the early pace, advanced seven wide and offered a mild late rally. DYNAMITE LAD was
taken back early, angled to the rail and offered a mild rally. TEMPLE KNIGHTS was unhurried early, circled eight wide through the turn and offered some
late gain. MY LUCKY MARK chased the early pace, went five wide into the turn and gave way. FAIR CHALLENGE raced in mid pack early, raced between
rivals and tired. ALLTHEWAYWITHTAYE set a clear early pace from off the rail and faded. MR VIEW was void of speed and was no factor.

Footnotes
STORM BAYOU set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail, opened up in mid stretch and edged clear for the win. SEAU stalked the early pace,
advanced between rivals into the home turn, angled to the inside, was no match late and finished second best. BIG MONEY MACHINE was unhurried early,
checked off heels into the first turn, made a middle move along the backstretch, advanced six wide through the second turn and was empty late. MOST
DETERMINED tracked the early pace, angled out in mid stretch and was empty late. GO TIME was void of speed, angled out eight wide in early stretch and
offered no late rally. GABO'S MACONDO pressed the early pace from between rivals and faded. THE STEWARDS LOOKED AT AN INCIDENT IN THE
FIRST TURN AND TOOK NO ACTION.
