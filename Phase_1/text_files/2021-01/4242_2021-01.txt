Footnotes
NATTY BEAU saved ground around the turn, eased out to the two path turning for home, closed between horses, drifted out late and was up approaching
the wire. YOU ARE AWESOME , three wide on the turn, was in hand waiting for room inside the three sixteenths pole, angled to the five path near the
eighth pole and rallied outside foes. WARM SUNNY BREEZE sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and weakened late. GAMING JACK ,
four deep on the turn, advanced to the sixteenth pole, and bumped with DYNAMIC DAY in deep stretch. DYNAMIC DAY , three wide chasing the pace
around the turn, steadied and bumped with GAMING JACK in deep stretch. THEDUKE OF HAZZARD lacked speed, raced in the two path on the turn and
failed to be a factor. FRANKEE MERCH , taken to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, remained along the rail and failed to rally. HAZELS LITTLE MAN
prompted the pace two wide and gave way.

Footnotes
ITALIAN DRESSING was rated back from between rivals soon after the break then taken outside, quickly advanced outside rivals mid turn, bid four wide
outside the leader nearing the lane, gained a short lead while dueling past the three sixteenths, forged clear a furlong out then widened on her left lead while
kept to task. EGG NOG had gate speed, stalked inside, was under coaxing to hold position past the three eighths, came out nearing the lane, worked
between runners leaving mid stretch and churned on willingly to nab the place. CLAIRE'S DARLING vied outside a rival, held a short lead mid turn, dug in
when confronted by the winner heading towards the quarter pole, battled in the three path into the lane, drifted in near mid stretch and faded. COWGIRL
NIGHT , racing without front shoes, settled well back and saved ground mid turn, was briefly caught behind a tiring rival near mid stretch, shifted out for
room, dropped back in advancing in the final sixteenth and kept on well to the line. SICK PACK SARA broke slowly, steadied when keen to the inside of
rivals early on, angled out mid turn and made a run four wide into the lane, chased but was out kicked. EMPTY POCKETS , between runners nearing the
half mile pole, failed to respond. NINE MAST rushed up to a short lead towards the rail, was hounded by CLAIRE'S DARLING, kept on to the head of the
lane then gave way. DRINKNWHISKEYNRYE gave early wide chase, failed to kick on while asked mid turn then gave way.

Footnotes
YOUNGEST OF FIVE vied between rivals around the first turn, pulled his way clear leaving the three quarter pole, was nicely rated setting the pace,
responded when set down two wide in upper stretch, opened up under stout left handed pressure near the furlong grounds then held sway late while kept
alert. TOY , under a firm hold early on, advanced to the inside of a pair of rivals leaving the five sixteenths, eased out to have aim on the winner in upper
stretch, kept on grinding to bridge the gap but wasn't quite good enough. MINE NOT MINE broke slowly, settled off the pace while saving some ground,
moved up some under a ride while saving ground into the lane but lacked a serious follow through. THE POSER was urged from the gate and battled inside
two foes around the first turn, was rated back allowing the winner to clear past three quarter pole, stalked off the rail into the far turn, chased three wide into
the lane and faded. MR THRIFTY , off the pace while four wide, was under a ride leaving the far turn but failed to respond. PADRINO'S HEART , three deep
vying through the opening quarter mile, continued wide stalking into the far turn, raced four wide under coaxing into the lane and weakened. HOT N SPICY
LOVE failed to menace while saving ground into the stretch. MARDEN broke a step slow, lagged off the pace, raced three wide into the lane and failed to
menace.

Footnotes
KEWPIE DOLL lacked speed, circled the turn, was taken to the five path in upper stretch, took the lead inside the eighth pole and drew out under steady
handling. BREEZE OFF THE BAY , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, gained the lead outside UNREQUITED LOVE approaching the eighth pole
then weakened late. SUPREME BLESSING , two wide on the turn, angled out in mid stretch and rallied. UNREQUITED LOVE sprinted to the early lead, set
the pace along the rail and weakened the final furlong. MIT MAZEL , three deep on the turn, chased the pace to the stretch, drifted in approaching the
eighth pole and gave way. MISCHIEFS MODEL soundly bumped TRIP TO FREEDOM when bearing in sharply soon after the break, checked in tight
quarters near the five eights pole, saved ground on the turn, gave way and was eased the final furlong. SUBLIMITY was not a factor. TRIP TO FREEDOM
unseated her rider when soundly bumped soon after the break. Following a stewards' inquiry, MISCHIEFS MODEL was disqualified and placed seventh.

Footnotes
MAKIN' OUT tracked the dueling leaders while in hand two wide, eased out mid turn, bid three wide to engage the leader into the lane, moved to command
inside the quarter pole, dueled under a drive, wandered outward in deep stretch and dug in gamely to prevail. NANA'S SHOES settled within range while
saving ground, angled four wide advancing into the lane, ranged up outside the embattled leaders leading the sixteenth pole, loomed but was kept at bay.
RAGTIME SUZY vied outside CALYPSO GHOST from the three quarter pole to about mid turn, briefly went clear then was taken on by the winner, dropped
in towards the rail to duel, ceded the lead past the quarter pole but dug in nicely through the final furlong. DON'T CHARGE IT , off the pace, was under
pressure mid turn then had belated action between rivals. MISDRIVEN prompted the early duel three wide, dropped back some around the turn, shifted six
to seven wide for the drive but went evenly in the final eighth. FLOATING BY , four wide, faded around the turn. CALYPSO GHOST moved up to the inside
of RAGTIME SUZY nearing the three quarter pole, disputed the pace to about the five sixteenths then gave way. BOOM BOOM GONE stumbled at the
break, raced off the pace while saving ground and failed to respond.

Footnotes
FACTOR IT IN prompted the pace in hand, circled the turn three wide, secured command entering the stretch and drew away under steady handling.
TYBALT lacked speed, raced five deep on the turn and passed tired rivals. MY FRIENDS BEER , well placed four wide on the turn, lacked the needed rally.
HANALEI'S HOUDINI advanced in the two path between horses mid way on the turn then weakened through the stretch. FIBER AND EMILY showed speed
along the inner rail and steadily weakened through the stretch. STILL HAVING FUN saved ground on the turn, eased out entering the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
BELLE TAPISSERIE was hustled up between rivals to be on near even terms, dueled two to three wide outside JOVIS, seized command in upper stretch,
battled past the furlong grounds while on her left lead, shook clear and was kept to steady pressure to the line. JOVIS sped to a short lead, dueled to the
inside of the winner and gave way grudgingly. HARD FOUGHT was taken firmly in hand early on, dropped in to save ground around the turn, remained
inside through the drive and kept on with interest. SEANY P , four to five wide advancing near the half mile marker, stalked the dueling leaders but lacked a
solid response. DIAL OPERATOR broke a step slow, circled five wide into the lane and offered a mild kick. LET'S PLAY NINE , away alertly, was nudged
along three to four wide chasing the top pair, failed to keep pace entering the stretch and faded. INSIDE RISK had some speed then was rated back off the
leaders, raced between foes leaving the three eighths, swung wide and came up empty. PERFECT COVER , off the pace, saved ground into the lane,
angled out then back in and offered a mild kick. NO MORE TALK , off the pace, raced five to six wide in upper stretch and lacked a bid. JAMMER broke a
step slow, lagged inside, swung wide for the drive and failed to menace.

Footnotes
LADY FOX lacked speed, moved up four deep entering the far turn, secured command entering the stretch and eagerly pulled away while under a drive.
RUNNING ON ENTRY saved ground on the far turn, swung to the four path turning for home and rallied mildly outside foes. RYE STREET , lightly bumped
by ZOLA B leaving the starting gate, raced three wide the first turn, saved ground the far turn while making a mild move then weakened in the stretch.
MALICEINTHEPALACE lacked speed, raced inside horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. R AWESUM BETTY lacked speed, failed to be a factor and
passed tired horses. CARROT CAKE , quickly clear, set the pace along the rail and retreated through the stretch. PO DUNK , inside horses down the
backstretch, chased the pace, faltered and was eased. ZOLA B bumped RYE STREET when coming out at the break, raced four wide the first turn, chased
the pace to the far turn, stopped and was eased. TIME TRAVEL , three wide the first turn, chased the pace down the backstretch, stopped and was eased.
