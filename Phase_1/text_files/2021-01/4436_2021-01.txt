DECEITFUL ANTHONY away alertly, set all the pace and widened through the final furlong under right handed urging to win going away. SUNNY BEAST
stalked the pace into the stretch, dug in in the six path and got up for second. KILTOOM broke slowly, shifted out to the seven path, ran up on heels past the
half mile marker, bumped, loomed boldly in the five path entering the stretch then leveled off. FRANK THE TANK chased the pace and was outfinished
along the inside. DAUER allowed to settle, bumped at the seven sixteenths pole then failed to respond. ROCHEBLAVE failed to menace. TOP HAT
TROUBADOUR trailed. THE RIDER OF DAUER LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF KILTOOM FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE
NEARING THE TURN, AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

SPIT'S IMAGE unhurried, closed fast four wide on the far turn and into the stretch, made the lead in six path a furlong out and finished full of run under a
hand ride to win as much the best. PALI'S REWARD trailed into the far turn, rallied determinedly in the six path through the stretch and finished second
best. EDGE chased the pace two wide and was outfinished. QUEEN OF THE TILES sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, widened quickly, set the
pace while getting slow fractions until mid stretch and weakened late. COWGIRL CHROME close up for six furlongs, wilted. TAP THE TOWN broke inward
and was through early. FORMER BUNNY well placed inside, faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
FINAL JEOPARDY never far back, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole, drifted to the middle of the racetrack, dug in under right handed
urging to make the lead late and drew off. MO DONT NO made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch, dueled until the final
stages, dug in determinedly and gained second. FLATTER ME PLEASE stalked the pace into the far turn, drew on even terms for the lead two wide nearing
the quarter pole, matched strides until deep stretch and was outfinished. DOUBLE THE LAUGH stalked the pace and finished determinedly two wide.
FRANCO unhurried early, offered a strong bid along the rail into the stretch then leveled off. SCARED WARIOR was no factor. ACOSTA prompted the pace
two wide for a half, stopped, was eased to the wire and walked off.

TIZWAY'S WILD SON broke slowly, was allowed to settle, closed with a burst of speed in the middle of the racetrack and got up in the final strides. ASTRO
JAK never far back, closed willingly between horses and just missed. ODIE away alertly, set the pace off the rail, drifted to the six path entering the stretch,
dug in determinedly but was outfinished in the final stages. GOLD SHARK stalked the pace from the inside, loomed boldly entering the stretch then leveled
off. DREAM SATURDAY with the second flight three wide, inched closer on the turn then failed to sustain that bid. LEM ME TEL YA saved ground and
lacked the needed response. KING DADDIO chased the pace from between horses and was through after a half. SELLING OUT trailed.

Footnotes
NEVER FOREVER vied for the lead from the start, battled along the rail through the stretch and proved best under strong handling. LIVE THE MOMENT
chased the early pace, surged five wide to make the lead entering the turn, quickly shook clear, set the pace until deep stretch then couldn't handle the
winner. ROSES FOR DOUG chased the pace and went evenly in the four path. FABULOUS DREAMER vied for the early lead between horses and was
through after a half. ANOTHER RACHEL was through early. LADY OF THE DISCO was outrun. NURSE KATIE set the early pace and stopped in the two
path on the turn. WHOA NELLIE GIRL had speed into the turn, stopped, was eased to the wire and walked off.
