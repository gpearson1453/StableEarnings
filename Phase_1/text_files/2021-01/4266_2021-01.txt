FINE ONE WON stalked the pace, took over before half then drew away while kept to a drive. SMOKIN PRINCESS dropped far behind then closed strongly
while no threat. RUNNING GIRL set the pace inside then began weakening on the final turn. CARMELTINI pinched back early, lagged far behind and was
no factor. MADELYN'S DANCER lacked speed and was always far behind. DONA CAMILE prompted the pace outside and stopped abruptly.

quarter pole, dug in gamely inside and held on late for second. DON'T RECALL raced close up on the inside, came through on the rail to challenge, dueled
inside, chased on the far turn and closed late. INSPIRED OPTIONS broke in and off slowly, raced off the pace inside, angled out at the quarter pole, came

PASSPORT REQUIRED set the pace racing with a clear early lead, dueled with AIN'T NONE LUCKY on the far turn, inched away from that rival, drifted out
at the eighth pole and edged away, driving. AIN'T NONE LUCKY stalked close up two wide, then pressed the pace, dueled on the far turn, dug in gamely in
upper stretch and came up second best. QUIET PLEASE reluctant to load, stalked three wide, then chased three wide and finished evenly. PABLO'S
DREAM raced two wide off the pace and lacked a rally. FRISKY FEELING was off a bit slow, raced three wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane
and had no rally. AFRICAN SONG raced off the pace inside and did not factor. TWEETY KITTEN raced off the pace inside and was outrun.

DOUBLE THE BET settled outside, advanced on the turn then surged late between rivals moving clear in the final sixteenth. DREAMING DIAMONDS
dueled outside, led at the quarter pole, bid clear but was outfinished. FREEDOM PASSAGE saved ground early, angled out on the turn and offered only a
mild rally. SHERO vied inside to the stretch then gradually weakened. SHE'S PRIMO broke sluggishly, advanced inside then proved empty in the stretch.
RISQUE EXPRESS hesitated at the start, moved inside and failed to threaten. J J LOVES BILLY chased wide throughout and was never in contention.
KARABESSA raced close up three wide for a quarter mile and stopped.

CHILLY IN CHARGE lacked speed outside, bid on the turn then surged clear through the final furlong. I'M BUSY settled inside, rallied to the front midway on
the turn moved clear but was outfinished. ROYAL URN rated along the inside, angled out rallying into the stretch but flattened out. WENTZ vied for the lead
in the two and then inside and proved empty in the stretch. BROAD STREET BULLY dropped back outside then passed fading rivals. NEW COMMISSION
saved ground far behind and was never a factor. ARKAAN prompted the pace outside for half a mile and gave way. IRISH COLONEL raced outside within
striking range but faded on the turn. PNUTBUTTER SPECIAL was urged close up inside briefly then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
THE KING CHEEK vied inside, bid clear after a quarter mile, drifted out in the stretch but remained safe driving. ZERTZ dropped far behind, advanced with
a rush inside too late. PALATIAL TIMES lacked speed, angled inside, bid into the stretch, and was nailed for the place. CLASSY AMERICAN saved ground
well behind, swung extremely wide into the stretch. ALPHA CHI RHO raced close up outside for half a mile and weakened. PENSAMIENTO trailed early
then passed tiring opponents. JUST A THOUGHT pressed the winner outside to the turn and gave way after half a mile. CLAW hustled just off the leaders
and stopped abruptly. GARBAN chased outside and gave way readily.
