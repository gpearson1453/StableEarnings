Footnotes
SMILE FOR ASHLEY dueled for the lead with LORD VADER from the inside, opened a clear margin into the stretch and held sway to the wire.
INSANIAMANIA lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished with good energy to
gain the place. LUCKY CAUSE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. LORD VADER broke sharply
to dispute the early fractions with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. ZERO BUCKS GIVEN raced off the pacesetters
early, lacked racing room into the stretch, angled in nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with good courage. WILD WAGER was forwardly placed from
the inside throughout and failed to gain in the drive. PROOF OF PARANOIA was never far back, raced three-wide through the turn and gradually gave way
in the drive. SILVER MOMENT lugged out throughout and was not urged.

SHOULD BE ILLEGAL stalked the pace of MOSQUITO FLEET while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths pole and
quickly drew off. BROCK ON BY was checked soon after the start then raced unhurried, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the
stretch and rallied late to gain the place. QUAZE VIPER broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing three-wide, was pushed in slightly in mid-stretch,
recovered quickly and finished with good courage. ELUSIVE LOVE was forwardly placed early, dropped back slightly while racing four-wide through the turn
and finished with some late run. OUR EXPECTATION settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, drifted in with a furlong to run and
failed to sustain her rally. ROCK THIS BAR was checked at the start, raced off the pacesetters from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and did not
threaten. POGO lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MOSQUITO FLEET sprinted clear soon after the start, weakened
after going a half, was pushed inward nearing the eighth pole and continued to retreat. STAREDOWN showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the
turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
VRONILLA PARFAIT stalked the pace of PREMIERE LADY while racing three-wide, responded when set down for the drive, reached the fore with a furlong
to run and held off the closing MARILYN'S SMILE to prevail. MARILYN'S SMILE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and was
gaining on the winner late. PREMIERE LADY sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong.
MOMMY ROSE showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and was not a factor. NAMORITA was
forwardly placed from the inside and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
STAR RACER stalked the pace of the dueling leaders while racing four-wide, moved up in tandem with THE LITTLE H MAN to offer a bid in mid-stretch,
vied and proved best in a stiff drive. THE LITTLE H MAN settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn, reached leaders while a furlong to
run, vied with that winner but could not match strides through the final yards. MOOGIE CAT dueled for the lead from the inside with INDIANERA and gave
way through the final furlong. INDIANERA broke sharply to dispute the pace with MOGGIE CAT while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half.
LUCK IS MY NAME lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with a belated bid. SLEIGHT OF HOOF was off
slow, lagged far back early, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with some late run. SKY DINSKI was
forwardly placed early, raced off the rail through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and weakened. SARGENT LENZINI settled off the leaders early,
moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. FREEPORT JOE lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace.

CRISTIANO'S DREAM settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew off with complete
authority. GALLANT GUY broke sharply to dispute the pace with PROUD LION while racing three-wide, could not match strides with the winner in the drive
but finished well to hold the place. STORMIN GALILEO was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, bumped with JIMMY
BLUE JEANS nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly when clear. ROARING TIGER lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out
into the stretch and finished with good late energy. JIMMY BLUE JEANS chased the leaders while racing four-wide, bumped with STORMIN GALILEO
nearing the sixteenth pole and gave way. IMA RUMBLER was forwardly placed from the inside throughout and weakened through the final furlong. PROUD
LION was away alertly to duel for the lead from the inside with GALLANT GUY and weakened through the final furlong. SHINE LIGHT AUTISM was off
slow, lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
SLAM DUNK SERMON tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew clear. IN OUR A
broke sharply to set a pressured pace, drifted out in mid-stretch, could not hold off the winner but finished well to hold the place. MAKAH LANE settled off
the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with good energy. WINE AND WHISKY raced off the
pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished with a late rally. SUNRISE JOURNEY was away alertly to
chase the leaders while racing five-wide and failed to gain late. READY FOR A FIGHT pressed the pace from between foes and gave way through the final
furlong. PISTON settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, lacked room from mid-stretch to the sixteenth pole and did not threaten.
FLICFLAC lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor. EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER was void of early speed, raced four-wide through
the turn and failed to menace. EMERALD MAGIC was off slow and lagged throughout.

Footnotes
LITTLE JOHN settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, reached the fore in tandem with MY SUNSHINE, vied with that rival
and was up at wire. MY SUNSHINE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, offered a bid in mid-stretch, led, vied
with the winner and just missed. FRIENDLY OUTTHEDOR was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out into
the lane and finished with good energy. LUCKY GENERAL lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady bid.
HERDSMAN settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. ALLEYCAT was void of early speed, saved
ground through the second turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and did not menace. INDIAN HEAD NICKLE checked soon after the start,
showed brief speed and weakened. MERCY RULE dueled for the lead from the inside for three-quarters and weakened. GOOCH EXPRESS raced
four-wide through the first turn, dueled for the lead while racing three-wide for three-quarters and weakened. HARDY CHISEL chased the leaders from the
