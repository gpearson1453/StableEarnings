Footnotes
CHIEF THE GREAT went to the front, dueled for the lead, drove clear down the backside and held on well under steady urging. TIME FOR A SONG raced
within striking distance, late bid, couldn't catch the leader, but held on for the place. BLUE RIDGE MOON had a tight start, racing in the back, made a
steady gain, racing wide around the final turn and closed well. LEFT OF THE DIAL raced within contention, saved ground around the final turn and gained
ground down the stretch. FOXYCALL raced within striking distance, forwardly placed throughout and finished evenly. PUMP IT lacked early speed, moved
up, but was no factor. SHANGHAI HETTY broke out, raced wide around the first turn and was never a threat. VELVET NIGHT raced near the middle of the
pack in the early pace, faded and was no threat. CIRCLEOFSOUL flashed brief speed and dropped back.

HATTIES JEWEL unhurried in the early part, moved up on the inside around the second turn, drove clear and finished well. MOMENT pressed the early
pace, raced four wide around the final turn, too the advantage, but couldn't match strides with Hatties Jewel and proved second best. LINDANTE unhurried
in the beginning, moved up wide around the second turn, made a mild bid and proved no match for the top two. I'LL RAISE YOU raced evenly near the back
in the early part, came around the second turn five wide, moved up, but was no factor. ALLIDOISDREAMOFYOU dueled for the early lead and faded.
BLAISING GUITAR void of early speed and was never close. HE'S A LADY TAMER pressed the early pace and was finished early. ZENDELPHIAN dueled
on the front end in the beginning, saved ground, retreated and was eased to the wire.

up, but was no threat. FLAT OUT LOVE raced near the middle of the pack, put forth an even effort and lacked a bid. EXTRA DOUGH pressed the early
pace and faded. LAURIANO always raced near the back and showed little. CRAFTY IKE void of early speed and showed little.
