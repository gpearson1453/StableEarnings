Footnotes
ROSAT broke very fast and quickly cleared rivals on the backstretch, entered turn clear and along the inside, entered stretch in the two path, met menacing
bid by LUCKY ROMANO and proved best. LUCKY ROMANO chased ROSAT off the rail on the backstretch, entered turn along the inside and eased out
into the two path on the turn, took aim in the stretch and got up to leaders flank, but denied by game rival in deep stretch. CAPTAIN N. BARRON tracked
clear leader in between rivals on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, entered stretch in the four path, kept gaining in the stretch and finished a clear third.
BOUNTY HUNTER tracked leader two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, continued two wide into the stretch, angled out a path in the stretch
and flatted out in deep stretch. DEVIL'S TEETH steadied sharply at the start, lost at least five lengths due to the trouble, settled into comfortable stride two
wide at the rear of the field, entered turn two wide, showed late interest by finishing up well along the inside. EARLE GRAY lacked speed at the start and
just stayed in one speed throughout along the rail. WALK ON WATER tracked leader three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn and
came up empty in the stretch.

LOST THE MINISTER chased duo on the front end along the inside, on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, eased out into the stretch to
launch bid and kept on in the stretch to hold third. CHIEF EAGLE EYE chased leaders two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, drifted out a bit
mid turn, corrected and continued three wide into the stretch and finished up evenly. DERBY FACTOR hesitated and came out slow, spotted the field a
good five lengths, stayed along the inside on the backstretch and into the turn, continued along the inside and showed mild interest in the stretch. ZINZAN
tracked leaders three wide on the backstretch, entered turn three wide, lacked needed response in the stretch and came up empty. DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION, THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED
