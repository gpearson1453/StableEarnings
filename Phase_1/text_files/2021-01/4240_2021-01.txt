Footnotes
LOVE BOUND was well placed just off the pace, dropped back a bit while needing a little extra left-rein pressure departing the backstretch, saved ground
while asked on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path under the whip, chased the leader under a drive into the final furlong, gained into the final
sixteenth and got up late under strong urging. MONARCHOS PRAYER tracked the pace down the backstretch, went around the turn in the three path, made
a bid coming to the five-sixteenths, took the lead into the stretch then edged clear, led into the final sixteenth but was caught in the final strides while clear
for the place. FLAT OUT BIG MONEY broke a step slow, settled at the rear of the field, went two to three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive and finished willingly for the show. TOODALOO TO YOU broke through the front of the gate prior to the start then was brought back around and
reloaded, bumped with a foe at the start then brushed with that same foe early, settled off the pace, was asked while three wide early on the turn, shifted
five wide late on that bend, chased the leader into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. C'ESTBON C'ESTBON bumped with foes on both sides at
the start, brushed with a rival early, settled on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and weakened.
LEXI EM broke a half-step slow, moved up to take the lead then angled in while going clear, was challenged while inside on the turn, lost the lead into the
stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BAQUERO'S BIND went to the front, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, set the pace with some company to his outside, shook clear under urging
while along the rail on the far turn, responded well when challenged by the runner-up in upper stretch and drew away under strong urging. GRAND
PRIORITY broke out at the start, went four wide early on the first turn, dropped to three then two wide later on that bend, was well placed in third position,
chased in the two path on the far turn, gained three wide into the stretch, made a brief bid around the three-sixteenths but was turned away by the winner
and proved no match but was well clear for the place. GOOD OLD CHARLIE was hustled from the start then forced out seven wide into the first turn,
dropped to six wide around the seven-eighths, settled well back on the outside, advanced four wide under urging on the far turn, came five wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. STARVICTORY went three then two wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, saved
ground while urged along on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, angled out in the vicinity of the furlong marker and failed to threaten while
improving position. TOTALLY ADDICTED went two then three wide on the first turn, moved up under a tight hold early on the backstretch to prompt the
pace on the outside, dropped back in the three path under urging on the far turn and capitulated. LOOKIT was fanned out six wide into the first turn then
dropped to five wide, moved in entering the backstretch, settled off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and failed to respond. IDE B STRANDED was
pinched back between horses after the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, lagged well back in the field, went five wide on the far turn and was eased
in the stretch but walked off. BABE REED was unsettled in the gate then shifted out at the start and bumped hard with a foe, came out into the first turn,
went three to four wide on that bend, dropped back early on the backstretch, fell further back under urging into the far turn and retreated then was eased in
the stretch but walked off. ROGER'S WORLD was bumped soundly at the start then forced out into the first turn, went four to five wide on that bend, was

KNOCKALITTLELOUDER broke in and bumped with a foe, set the clear pace, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, responded well when set
down in upper stretch, extended the advantage into the final furlong, remained clear under a left-handed whip while still on his inside lead into the final
sixteenth and was fully extended to last under strong urging. DIXIE STREET settled just off the pace, moved in then advanced closer around the half-mile
pole, dropped back a bit leaving the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn, floated six wide into the stretch, drifted in under a left-handed whip
starting around the furlong marker, continued to drift in some while gaining on the winner into the final sixteenth and finished with good energy but was too
late while well clear for the place. AVAILABLE STAR was hustled from the start, tracked the pace on the outside, chased three to four wide on the turn and
weakened while just able to hold the show. LOVE THAT WARRIOR bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along near the back, saved ground on the
turn and just missed the show. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved
off the rail under a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. HEREWECOMETOGETYOU broke in a bit, moved out while urged off the pace on the
backstretch, went five to six wide on the turn and had nothing left. JENNOVODKA bumped with a rival at start, was ridden along at the rear, went two to
three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch then moved further out around the three-sixteenths and was no factor. PILLAGE DA VILLAGE veered
out at the start, was urged along on the outside, went four to five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and faltered then was eased in the final

Footnotes
PAT DADDY broke a step slow, was coaxed along on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, rallied to the lead in upper stretch, dueled outside of the
runner-up in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. O'L RED showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in
the two path while still inside a foe on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch, fought gamely with that foe in the final furlong and just
missed while clear for the place. WESTERN TROUBLE broke a step slow, was urged along at the rear, went four then five wide on the turn, turned into
upper stretch under a strong drive, chased the top two under the whip into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while able to secure the show.
LYNCHBURG drifted in just after the start, settled on the inside, saved ground on the turn, was roused late on that bend, turned into the stretch in the two
path, came under the whip outside the three-sixteenths, drifted out inside the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. HITTERS PARK settled off
the pace, went around the turn in the two path, had his head turned to the inside under extra left-rein pressure late on that bend, altered to the outside from
behind foes in upper stretch and came up empty. BYE BYE BIRDSTONE was sent hard from the start, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three
path on the turn and tired.

SAVE pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took the lead inside the three-sixteenths, battled outside of the runner-up into the
final sixteenth then moved clear under steady urging. BOLD CONFECTION was hustled to the lead, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the
two path while still inside a foe on the turn, lost the advantage under a drive inside the three-sixteenths, fought with the winner into the final sixteenth and
was outfinished while clear for the place. MUCHO MACHO MOMMA was rated just off the pace, saved ground while let out on the turn, swung four wide into
upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show. MOMARIA settled off the pace while inside of BREONNA, brushed with that foe near
the half-mile pole, went three then two wide on the turn and came up empty. BREONNA settled on the outside, brushed with MOMARIA near the half-mile
pole, chased four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and capitulated.

FIGURE IT OUT moved in while going quickly to the front, was well rated while setting the pace in the two path, cruised clear under her own power on the
far turn, extended the advantage without being asked into the final furlong and drew off with the rider poised like a statue in irons to win easily while never
asked. SENSIBLE MYTH saved ground on the first turn, was lightly rated off the pace, came under urging while inside on the far turn, turned into the stretch
in the two path, was put to the whip at the three-sixteenths and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. SPARTANKA shifted from two to
three wide early on the first turn, settled at the rear on the outside, was urged along while three then four wide on the far turn and came up empty. CHIKARA
raced in the three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
WISHING BELLE was well spotted just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused while cutting the corner into the stretch, moved out behind the
leader outside the furlong marker, took the advantage near the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under strong urging. TWO MORE BARBO set the pace
under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail while still inside of a foe on the turn, responded well under heavy pressure in upper stretch, maintained the
lead under a drive into the final furlong but was overtaken into the final sixteenth while just able to save the place. DIAMOND AND SILKS angled in towards
the rear, started the turn in the two path, angled five wide while gaining fast outside the five-sixteenths, floated eight wide into the stretch, chased in the
center of the track past the eighth-pole, drifted out in the final furlong and was out-kicked then just missed the place while clear for the show. LINDA GOT
LUCKY was restless in the gate, broke out at the start then was hustled, chased the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn, made a brief bid in
upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. WHERES MOM pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the three path under
urging on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. YOUR MY SUNSHINE was restless in the gate, brushed with a foe at the start, was urged
along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and came up empty. I GOT WINGS was ridden along on the outside, went
three then two wide on the turn and failed to respond. CAST YOUR CROWN was taken in hand early, raced at the rear on the far outside, moved in leaving
the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch then moved further out around the three-sixteenths and was no
factor. BRIGHTNMORNINGSTAR was restless in the gate, brushed with a foe at the start, was urged along on the outside, went five to six wide on the turn
and had nothing left.
