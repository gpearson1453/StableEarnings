Footnotes
COMRADERY (IRE) stalked the pace in the two to three wide, swung out into the stretch, rallied and got up in time. RIP CITY bobbled leaving the gate but
remained quickest early, set the pace inside then in the two path, led under pressure up the backstretch, angled to the rail and vied with a pair of rivals into
the lane, held command to the final yards and was nailed by the winner. STARTING OVER traveled along the inside while off the pace, stayed inside then
two wide into the stretch, rallied between rivals late and proved a game third. LANE WAY attended the pace three deep, vied outside around the second
turn, spun four wide into the lane and was edged for the show. GREGDAR pressed the pace from outside, vied between rivals around the second turn and
into the drive, stayed in contention through the lane then flattened a bit late. LIBERAL (IRE) broke in a bit at the start, angled to the inside, raced in range
then closed in up the backstretch, steadied behind the leader at the three-eighths pole, remained inside to the stretch, asked in the late but could not find
the needed response. MANTRA brushed at the start, raced outside a rival then three wide into the drive and never rallied. STRIKING A POSE brushed
leaving the gate, tracked off the inside, two wide around the far turn and weakened.

the fence and got up for 2nd. SLEW SOUTH tracked outside a rival then between foes, split another pair at the three-eighths pole, angled out into the
stretch, rallied and was outkicked by the top pair. STARSHIP SKY stalked outside a rival then between foes, bid outside and headed the leader at the
three-eighths pole, could not keep pace around the bend, chased to the stretch and kept on willingly but needed more. PHOENIX TEARS sped to the front
and crossed over to the inside, let clear up the backstretch then got headed by rival at the three-eighths, cleared again around the final turn then yielded in
the furlong grounds. LIVIN' AT THE BU bumped at the start, stalked between early then moved to the inside, closed in up the backstretch, saved ground to
the stretch and weakened. SHEZ OUR ARCH forced in and steadied early, floated out a bit into the first turn, stayed off the rail to the stretch and weakened.
ARISTEIA off a bit slow to begin, steadied off the heels of the leader then pulled early on the first turn, bid outside at the three-eighths pole, chased four
wide into the lane and faded. WIN LIKE COACH P bumped at the start, floated out a bit into the first turn, chased three deep then four wide into the far turn,
dropped back and angled in a path and faded.

Footnotes
JAN JAN CAN settled off the pace, went three wide into the turn, angled in then back out into the stretch, tipped out at the top of the drive, flew late and
nailed SWEET SONNY on the line. SWEET SONNY vied three deep early then cleared foes, set the pace off the rail then angled in on the turn, led clear
into the final sixteenth and was nailed at the wire. WICKS AND CHAPPIES showed early speed inside a pair of rivals then chased the leader to the turn,
went two wide around the bend and finished evenly. HAUTE TIME traveled near the rear of the field outside a rival, went three then two wide around the
bend, came out into the stretch and finished with a late rally. MAJESTIC MOUNTAIN tracked the lone leader from outside, entered the turn five wide then
angled to the three path on the turn and lacked further response. A J ROCK tracked near the rail then moved out a bit on the backstretch, chased between
foes to the stretch and could not rally. SUGAR MOON showed early speed between a pair of rivals then chased off the rail, went three to four wide around
the turn and faded. GEMMA ROYAL stalked the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and weakened in the drive. TURKISH ANGEL
raced at the back of the pack, angled to the inside and saved ground through the turn and never made an impact.

Footnotes
JUST A COMMAND chased off the inside, advanced four wide around the turn, closed steadily through the drive and overhauled BEN'S A GOALIE in the
closing moments. FUNKENSTEIN off a bit slow to begin, trailed the field early went five wide around the turn, shifted out into the stretch, rallied but could
not get by the winner. BEN'S A GOALIE dueled for the lead between rivals, cleared inside rival at the quarter pole, lugged out in upper stretch, then drifted
in and back out while still maintaining a clear lead, weakened late and was caught by the top pair. ROBIN'S LEGACY stalked the pace from outside, came
off the turn four wide, drifted inward in the stretch and lacked the needed bid. STONE'S RIVER angled in early, traveled along the inside to the turn, angled
three wide leaving the bend, came out some in the stretch and kept on through the final furlong. CHIEF JACKSON attended the pace three deep, chased
the to pair two to three wide around the turn and weakened. PROUD MUSKET tracked three then two wide around the turn and never rallied. THE ROAN
RANGER chased along the inside, saved ground to the lane and weakened. THELUTEISMINE chased off the rail, went three wide around the turn, had
nothing left for the stretch, was eased and walked off. REST EASY TWO FOUR dueled for command inside a pair of rivals, lost contact with rival at the
quarter pole, tired in the stretch then eased and walked off. BIG DISCOUNT in range between rivals, dropped back around the bend, eased in the lane and
walked off. BRANANX bothered by rival and steadied early near the inside, tracked off the inside, started to weaken around the turn, eased in the lane and
walked off.

Footnotes
EARLS ROCK (IRE) stalked from inside then angled three wide into the drive, rallied to the front at the eighth pole and won going away. MAN FRIDAY
stalked outside, applied some pressure on the backstretch, closed in and headed rival at the five-sixteenths, dueled from outside into the lane, could not
match the winner but gained the place. ENOUGH NONSENSE sprinted clear to take control early, pressured a bit on the backstretch, headed around the far
turn, dueled into and down the stretch, overtaken by the winner at the eighth pole and got edged for the place. ENDLESS SUNSET tracked two wide then a
bit off the rail into the lane and kept on for a minor share. AIRMAN bumped leaving the gate, traveled along the inside the moved out a bit on the
backstretch, went between foes at the seven-sixteenths, tipped out and lost the whip inside the furlong grounds and finished willingly. DANIEL'S MAGIC
bumped with EXALTED JOY prior to the first turn, chased two wide around the first turn, three wide into the lane and failed to respond to urging. NORTH
POLE stumbled badly and bumped both sides at the start, raced three wide around the first turn, remained in the three path then came four wide into the
stretch and was never a factor. ACHILLEUS saved ground into the lane and was never a threat. IVORY SKY broke in and bumped rival leaving the gate,
angled to the inside quickly, settled at the back of the pace, continued along the inside, swung five wide into the stretch and could not rally. EXALTED JOY
bumped with rival nearing the first turn, in range early, stalked outside a rival on the backstretch, started to weaken on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
GREAT POWER bumped leaving the gate, stalked in the two path, went two to three wide around the turn, angled out in upper stretch, rallied and bested
MALAKAI MOXIE late. MALAKAI MOXIE vied for the lead three deep then cleared foes around the turn, led to deep stretch and got caught. DEFENSE
WINS raced along the inside, saved ground to the stretch then angled off the inside and gained ground late. SQUALOTORO chased four then three wide
around the turn and finished willingly for a minor share. BOB'S SNIPER vied for the lead between rivals, could not keep pace with the leaders into the turn,
chased outside a rival to the stretch and flattened out. DAPPER forwardly placed from outside, entered the turn four wide, moved in a path then back out
four wide into the lane and never produced a bid. ECOLOGIST off a bit slow to begin, raced off the pace, was along the inside into and around the turn,
tipped out in the lane and never threatened. UNCAPTURED HERO broke out and bumped rival at the start, vied for the lead from inside, could not keep
pace around the turn and faded in the drive. DYNAMIC DUO dropped back early, angled into the two path, went around a rival and four wide into the stretch
and made no impact. ASTROLOGER chased two wide then angled three wide into the lane and tired.
