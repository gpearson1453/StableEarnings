MITCH'S PINS led throughout then drew clear on the final turn while driving and was much the best. WEAVEMEAWINR was unhurried early from the inside
then angled out on the turn and was second best. GEORGIA DAWN stalked the pace from the three path made a mild bid at the three quarters pole and
held the show. TWN TAWFEERS PARTY was unhurried early and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. CHATAIN'S FLYER pressed the pace from the three
path and gave way. RUNNING ROSADO raced in the middle of the pack from the three path and was not a factor. ENVOY'S GUILT was allowed to settle
from the two path but failed to menace.

ROYAL PRIVACY set the pace from the inside then drew clear at the eighth pole and drew off in the stretch while driving. DEVILS HALO stalked the pace
from the inside then made a bid in the stretch and was clearly second best. WARNED chased the leaders from the three path and made a late rally for the
show. AZTEC DELITE stalked the pace from the two path and lacked the late response in the drive. HOLLYWOOD SQUARE was pinched back at the start
and was not a factor. HARLONS COMMISION stalked the pace from the two path and gave way. ELITE RUNNER was not a factor.
