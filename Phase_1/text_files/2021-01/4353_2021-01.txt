Footnotes
PAPA CABALLERO chased clear leader two wide on the backstretch, eased out early in the turn to launch two wide bid, collared rival approaching the
stretch and kicked clear upper stretch. SOUND CHECKERS tracked leader along the inside on the backstretch, entered turn along the inside, eased out into
the three path in the stretch and earned second at the sixteenth pole and kept on in deep stretch. HOSS CARTWRIGHT chased clear leader two wide on
the backstretch, entered turn two wide, drifted into three wide position, drifted out into the stretch, entered stretch in the four path and lightly urged in deep
stretch while a clear third. BADGER tracked leaders in the three path on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, began to weaken in upper stretch, and
bested rest. MOUNTAIN VIEW bumped by CONVEX at the start, quickly recovered and sent to a clear lead on the backstretch, entered turn along the
inside, collared late on the turn by eventual winner, and tired readily past the sixteenth pole. CONVEX broke in, bumped start, dropped back while not being
asked on the backstretch, continued to trail the field into the turn and into the stretch, showed some late interest while making up ground on tiring rivals but
failed to make an impact.
