Footnotes
UP TIME tracked trio of leaders off the rail in the two path, continued into the turn well placed and two wide, ranged up late in the turn to be three wide
approaching the eighth pole, kept busy in the stretch and proved best late while holding off late bid from rival inside. JOURNEY CAKE got a bit anxious in
the gate, broke well and chased leader along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the rail into the turn and into the stretch, once rail opened up,
rider asked for run and responded well and just missed. AWESOME PIRATE bobbled and bumped rival at the start, pressed leader two wide on the
backstretch, and entered turn two wide, stayed on well in the stretch while holding third. THATS WHAT U GET bumped by outside rival at the start, quickly
assumed command on the backstretch, entered turn clear and on the inside, held slim margin at top of the stretch and outfinished by rivals in deep stretch.
HERE I GO INDY rubbed gate and bumped rival at the start, causing jock to injure his leg, settled along the inside on the backstretch, entered turn along the
rail and failed to launch a menacing bid in the stretch while not ridden hard. BOLD EAGLE bumped by outside rival at the start, quickly dropped back to the
rear of the field and failed to launch a bid.
