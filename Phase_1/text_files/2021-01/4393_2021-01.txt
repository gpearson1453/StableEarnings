Footnotes
MOST SANDISFACTORY dueled for the early lead towards the inside, shook clear before a half then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the
best while under a hand ride. PRINCE AMADEUS battled with the winner two wide around the clubhouse turn, chased that one the balance of the trip and
just held on for second. DO YOUR BEST trailed into the stretch then had a mild late rally in the four path. DIVULGENCE well placed, failed to respond.
PRIVATE DANCER offered a mild bid on the far turn then came up empty. AMERICAN SOLUTION was no threat. BRISKY refused to break. THE
STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
THE DUSTMAN broke well and made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace and widened through the stretch under a hand ride to win as much the
best. BOURBON TRAIL never far back, had a mild late rally in the eight path and got up for second. PABLO'S QUEST unhurried early, found his best stride
late in the four path. ALLABOUTBIZ chased the winner near the inside until deep stretch then faded. COMMISSARIO well placed, failed to respond. AWE
PATRIOT was no threat. PRIME TIME was no factor. LONESOME PHIL had brief speed.

Footnotes
C C MY SIS settled within striking distance five wide, angled inward approaching the far turn, rallied to make the lead in the four path inside the furlong
marker and won going away. NATIVE LION chased the pace near the inside, inherited the lead before a half, set the pace until deep stretch then was no
match for the winner while well clear for second. COLORINCOLONEL unhurried early, had a mild late rally two wide. COSI MOMOSI close up three wide,
angled inward entering the far turn bumping with BELLA DUDETTE, drew closer entering the stretch then leveled off. STYLISH KITTEN trailed for a half
then passed tiring rivals. UCANTKEEPUP broke slowly, loomed boldly three wide on the far turn then came up empty. ABSOLUTE LOVE unhurried early,
advanced in the five path on the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. BELLA DUDETTE close up along the rail, was bumped and in tight entering the far
turn and dropped out of it. RUNNING CLOUD sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace for nearly a half, drifted out to the six path then
inward nearing the far turn, stopped, was eased to the wire and walked off. THE RIDER OF BELLA DUDETTE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE
RIDER OF COSI MOMOSI FOR INTERFERENCE NEARING THE FAR TURN. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED COSI MOMOSI AND
PLACED HER EIGHTH.

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED BOILER unhurried early, closed with a rush five wide near mid track, made the lead past the furlong marker and finished full of run under brisk
handling to win as much the best. WALDORF stalked the pace for three furlongs, rallied three wide to gain a narrow lead before the furlong marker then was
no match for the winner. SALT MINE trailed into the stretch then found his best stride late in the five path. POLO ART had speed from the start, moved up
four wide nearing the top of the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. THE BOOT WILDCAT dueled for the lead two wide until mid stretch and weakened
late. REWARD THE MIRACLE inside, failed to respond. DELAYED ENGAGEMENT battled for the lead along the inside until mid stretch then weakened.
HE'S SPECIAL had brief speed. HOLTZ was outrun.
