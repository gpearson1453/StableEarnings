Footnotes
QUEEN CALYPSO lied forwardly placed along the inside, rallied along the rail in upper stretch as ahead foes vacated it, produced a bid inside of the leader
passing the furlong marker, forged an advantage late, and just held. BETTABE SWIFT lied off of the pace under urging while shifting down to the three path,
swung to the six path turning for home, rallied outside of foes through the lane to produce a late bid, but just missed. ALEXANDRA AM I tracked from
midpack two wide, shifted four wide turning for home, rallied inside of BETTABE SWIFT through midstretch, but was outkicked by that foe passing the
sixteenth pole, then just caught the early pace setter for show. CLASSIC SECRET set the pace along the inside, shifted off of the rail in upper stretch while
holding an advantage, but was headed by the eventual winner to his inside passing the furlong pole, weakened, then got nailed on the wire for show. LA
DAME broke outwardly impeding multiple rivals, stalked along the inside, but failed to produce a bid and chased evenly through the lane. PRIZE PORTRAIT
was forced outwards by an inner rival at the start, took up between horses, then lied far off of the pace two to three wide, and stayed on through the lane.
SISTER IS DEVIL took a bump to her hind quarters at the start, lied far off of the pace two wide, then shifted in inside the final furlong while sustaining a
grinding rally. BAHAMIAN RHAPSODY stalked two wide, but weakened three wide in upper stretch. ECLIPTICALS CAROL was pinched back at the start,
lagged behind the main group around the turn, then passed tired foes without making an impact. DISPENSE and. GONE DREAMING saved ground far off
of the pace, but to no avail. GREATA raced greenly, was kept wide, and was distanced.

Footnotes
ENANO ASTRAY got brushed by REALTOR DANNY D at the start, began moving four wide around the turn, rallied to overhaul CHAMBERLAIN from
outside with a furlong remaining, and drew away under pressure. CHAMBERLAIN brushed with DEBBIE'S ROAD at the start, sprinted clear inside, could
not handle the winner past the eighth-pole but held to remain clear for the place. DEBBIE'S ROAD brushed with CHAMBERLAIN at the start, moved off the
inside to the three-path midway on the turn, and lacked a solid closing bid. PACHANGA PATROL broke slowly, raced well back around the turn two wide,
and improved with a mild response through upper stretch. REALTOR DANNY D stumbled at the break and recovered brushing into ENANO ASTRAY, raced
four to three wide and was outrun. REACTION TIME pursued outside CHAMBERLAIN for a half-mile, moved to the rail into the lane and tired. POPPY'S
PRIZE was finished early inside. CAPTURE THE CROWN gave way around the turn.

Footnotes
TEMPLET stalked two wide into the first turn, shifted down to the rail around that bend, tipped back out from behind the pace setter into the far turn, bid for
the lead turning for home, forged an advantage straightening into the lane, then drew off passing the furlong pole under driving pressure. MAURO'S TEAM
stumbled between horses for a stride before being jostled between them shortly after the start, trailed the field into the far turn, saved ground around that
bend before swinging four wide turning for home, and rallied with a good kick to just reach place on the wire. GUNMAN set the pace along the inside around
both turns, but was headed by the eventual winner straightening into the lane, gave way to that foe in midstretch, then tired and was nailed on the wire for
place. HIGH TIDE saved ground while taking back to midpack around the first turn, shifted four wide down the backstretch, came under a drive outside of
foes into the far turn, but only managed a mild gain around that turn, brushed with an inner foe while keeping that foe in behind the leaders turning for home,
then flattened out through the lane. COLLIERY saved ground off of the pace, advanced into the far turn to track from midpack, attempted to angle outside of
the leaders turning for home, but brushed with HIGH TIDE as that foe made him keep his path, then failed to produce a bid before tiring. GEORGIA PINES
tugged to a three wide stalking position into the first turn, shifted down a path around that bend, got floated back three wide into the far turn while sustaining
stalking position, then weakened between horses at the quarter pole. KALININGRAD tracked from midpack while shifting four to two wide around the first
turn, but faded between horses into the far turn and was done early. RUN UP DISTANCE IS UNAVAILABLE

TONY'S ROSE rated off of the pace in the three to two path around the turn, cut the corner turning for home before tipping three wide approaching the
furlong pole, surged to produce a bid outside of rivals in the late stages, and just got up at the wire. PROPER MANNERS stalked along the inside, smoothly
tipped outside of the pace setter entering the lane, grinded away to bid inside the final furlong, forged an advantage inside the final sixteenth, but was nailed
on the wire by an outer oncharging rival. MS HEADLEY set the pace along the inside, dug in through midstretch to maintain an advantage, but was bested
by a pair of rivals in the final sixteenth. CHARLOTTE THE BRIT lied at the rear of the field two wide, tucked to the rail passing the three furlong marker,
advanced by saving ground turning for home, then chased the leaders home while steadily making progress. AKOR tracked from midpack while caught four
wide around the turn, but lacked a kick to split foes in upper stretch, then stayed on thereafter, but failed to factor. PLAY THAT TONE stalked three wide, but
drifted to the five path in upper stretch, and faded. MRS. MAISEL prompted the pace two wide, but faded after being floated three wide in upper stretch, and
caved. SILVER TUNES was outrun along the inside.

SNACKSTER set the pace inside, spurted away from MS V TIME coming off the turn under a drive, and was geared down through the last 70 yards.
VEGAS WEEKEND was ridden along through the turn two wide, moved inside rallying through mid stretch, and held the place while not a threat to the
winner. MS V TIME pressed the pace outside, got shaken off by SNACKSTER turning for home, and ran on to salvage the show. AIR CAVALRY raced
forwardly three wide to the stretch, and had no closing response. HASHTAG LUCKY broke slowly and failed to factor two wide. YES IT'S FREE made no
impact three to four wide. MONTANA PRETTY raced four wide around the turn, and tired through the stretch. UNCAPTURED HEART faded steadily inside
after a half-mile.

Footnotes
TRAFFIC PATTERN rushed crossing the wire for the first time to vie for the lead outside of BIG MAN BOB while staying a path or two away from that rival
around the first turn, shifted down to the two path into the far turn, forged an advantage turning for home, drifted out slightly through the lane as CONVICT
PIKE ranged up alongside, then gamely fended that foe off to the wire. CONVICT PIKE lied far off of the pace two wide around the first turn, gained ground
into the far turn to stalk two wide and between horses around that bend, tipped three wide in upper stretch, rallied to bid outside of TRAFFIC PATTERN
through the lane, but was denied by that rival. JUAN PABLO was forwardly placed along the inside early on, got outmoved and rated in midpack into the far
turn, split foes two wide in upper stretch before surging inside of the leaders in the late stages, but missed reaching place. BIG MAN BOB set a pace while
feeling stern pressure from TRAFFIC PATTER, got headed by that foe turning for home, then kept on for a minor share. BUFFALO MAX was off a step
slowly and got bumped by an outer foe at the start, lied far off of the pace two wide, swung six wide turning for home, and stayed on. MY GOOD MAN saved
ground far off of the pace around the first turn, gained outside of foes into the far turn before taking that bend four to five wide, then chased evenly through
the lane. POSITIVE PHIL stalked the leading duo from the two path while pulling keenly around the first turn, settled down into the backstretch, saved
ground around the far turn, then chased the leading group through midstretch before fading. TIME FOR TROUBLE lied off of the pace two wide and
between horses, but never got involved. MASON'S SONG was outrun along the inside. MEMORABLE tracked from midpack three wide around the first turn,
made an early three wide move into the far turn to stalk around that bend, but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
DARK AGES settled near the back for a half-mile, began moving two wide around the turn, split TOTONO and CHARLIE THE GREEK rallying to contention
a quarter-mile out, caught PRO QUALITY from outside in deep stretch and pulled clear. PRO QUALITY pressed the pace between horses, took over and
moved clear coming to the five-sixteenths, could not withstand the top one near the sixteenth-pole, and saved the place. NACHO PAPA raced three to four
wide advancing after six furlongs, had aim outside the leaders through the furlong grounds but could make no further gains. PLATO broke slowly, was in
tight along the rail up the backstretch, and lacked a rally. TOTONO set a pressured pace inside, and gave way once displaced for command. CHARLIE THE
GREEK pressed the pace outside, and was finished approaching the stretch. NO GETTING OVER ME was through after a half.

Footnotes
ZANNO vied two wide, forged an advantage in upper stretch, repelled STATION ROCK's bid passing the furlong marker, and held sway to the wire.
MACHO BLUE rated off of the pace while a path off of the rail into the turn, inched closer around the bend to be in range of the leaders two wide and
between horses turning for home, shifted ground outwards a bit in midstretch causing NICHOLAS ROSE to be pinched, then sustained his chasing grind to
slightly narrow the leader's margin in the late stages. STATION ROCK lied far off of the pace four wide into the turn, rallied five wide and outside of foes
turning for home, produced a bid for the lead at the furlong grounds, but flattened out. BALISTICO lied off of the pace in the three to four path around the
turn, then stayed on between horses through the lane. TALE OF KANTHAROS saved ground far off of the pace, awaited racing room turning for home,
altered course six wide in midstretch, but failed to factor while improving to dead heat for fifth. WEEKEND DREAMER set the pace inside while feeling stern
pressure from ZANNO, but was headed by that foe in upper stretch, and tired. KYLE chased along the inside, but was outkicked by rallying foes in upper
stretch, and faded. NICHOLAS ROSE tracked forwardly placed outside of the pair of leaders, but was outkicked by outer foes in upper stretch, then got
pinched back between horses passing the furlong marker after MACHO BLUE drifted out a bit, then was protected thereafter.

Footnotes
HALLAWALLAH settled in the middle of the field early, swung four wide taking closer order after six furlongs, rallied to overhaul PRINCESS BETTY from
outside coming to the sixteenth-pole and drew clear. PRINCESS BETTY stayed close between horses into the turn, bid three wide and reached a short lead
with a furlong remaining, could not hold off the winner and was clearly best of the others. HEIRESSINDY saved ground moving to easy striking range up the
backstretch, lodged a mild bid between horses turning for home, but did not have enough. EXTRA EFFORT moved inside coming away with the lead out of
the chute, edged away after six furlongs, then yielded to challengers through the furlong grounds. MYLASTFIRSTKISS raced four then three wide around
the turn, moved inside once straightened away for the drive, and could not gain. KATZ A DREAM stayed close around the turn three to four wide, but faded
in the stretch. STORIE BLUE was outrun two wide. IMPECCABLE STYLE forced the pace outside EXTRA EFFORT, and faltered after six furlongs.
BACHELOR'S BAIT was finished early inside.

Footnotes
BOHEMIAN BOY saved ground off of the pace around the first turn, rated patiently in hand in the two to three path around the far turn, swung five wide
turning for home, produced a rally through the lane, shifted ground inwards a bit passing the furlong marker, bumped EXPONENTIAL in the process, then
sustained his charge to get up approaching the wire. THE GREAT OZ stalked two wide, bid for the lead between horses at the quarter pole, dueled through
the lane, but was outfinished by an outer oncharging foe. STRAIGHT UP GUY saved ground far off of the pace around the turns, shifted six wide through
upper stretch, then rallied to just reach show on the wire. NOT STORMY tracked from midpack three wide, gained around the far turn to bid for the lead at
the quarter pole, dueled through the lane, but flattened out late and was outfinished by multiple foes. EAMONN stalked along the inside and from the pocket,
shifted off of the rail in upper stretch in search of racing room, but failed to find some while chasing behind the leaders to the sixteenth pole, and failed to
produce a bid. EXPONENTIAL tracked from midpack along the inside, then from the two path around the far turn, shifted to the four path to rally inside of
BOHEMIAN BOY in upper stretch, but was bumped and bothered by that foe passing the furlong pole, got shut off and steadied due to the incident, then
kept on. GO SPEED RACER GO set the pace along the inside, got headed by a pair of rivals passing the quarter pole, then gave way late.
SUPERPOSITION hesitated at the start, saved ground while trailing around both turns, then stayed on along the rail through the lane. GANDOLFO lied
forwardly placed two wide and between horses early on, steadied while hard to handle into the first turn, held chasing position around the far turn, but was
outkicked between rivals in upper stretch and faded. OXFIRE lied far off of the pace two wide, and failed to get involved. GOLDEN FIDDLE lied far off of the
pace three wide around the first turn, advanced to midpack outside of foes down the backstretch, but weakened into the far trn and was done early.
WILLIAM BOY lied off of the pace two to three wide, but steadied when put to tight quarters into the far turn, and faded.
