FOGGY BOTTOM was five wide to the backstretch, tracked the pace to the second turn, raced four wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but dug
in determinedly and was along in time. PERFECT EDITION stalked the leader to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, responded in the drive,
closed steadily to catch ANGELS RULE late but was bested for the win. ANGELS RULE set all the pace, was off the rail to the stretch, battled gamely to the
final fifty yards then was outfinished. ON THE VERGE had no speed, saved ground to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. LIS LA VICTOIRE
also had no speed, was three wide throughout and did not rally. FRENCH TUDOR tracked the pace inside the winner, was two wide to the stretch but gave
way in the drive.

SIZZLING JAMIE never far back to the half, rallied three wide to get on terms on the second turn, dueled to mid stretch, dug in to inch away then held off
BAB FRANKIE late. BABY FRANKIE was allowed to settle to the half, was fanned out to the four path on the far turn, responded widest in the drive, closed
steadily but was too late. MEGAMEISTER contested the pace to the second turn, responded inside to mid stretch, stayed to deep stretch then was
outfinished. BOYSON settled mid pack to the second turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch, was in good striking position in mid stretch but could not
offer the needed response. DIRT ROAD RED had no speed, trailed for six furlongs while three wide then closed a gap in the drive without threatening.
HOLD ME CLOSE attended the pace for a half, was between rivals two wide to the stretch then tired.

Footnotes
IT'S MY HOUSE was on the pace outside of BODEEMAN and three wide, put that one away in upper stretch then held off ME B BUBBA T stubbornly. ME B
BUBBA T chased between rivals to the turn, bid two then three wide to the stretch and finished willingly but could not get to the winner while easily besting
the others. BODEEMAN hustled to contest the pace inside the winner, inched away mid turn then was tiring, gave up the advantage and gave way.
SPEEDY TOM had no speed, was two wide but never a factor. COMMAND SGT MAJOR was always outrun.

OUR BOLD PRINCE stalked the leaders to the turn, rallied four wide to get on terms into the stretch, inched away to mid stretch then held NIGHT GIG safe.
NIGHT GIG was chasing to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then finished willingly and was easily second best. RUNKERRY contested the pace off
the rail to the stretch then was outkicked and weakened. CRACK A COLD ONE attended the pace outside of RUNKERRY and three wide, was between
rivals to the stretch then also weakened in the final furlong. SURPRISE FASHION was slow to settle, trailed to the stretch and was not a threat. BARBIERE
got outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then lacked a closing response.

PURE PERFECTION was outsprinted to the turn, raced four wide then was forced out to the six path into the stretch, rallied when set down and closed
steadily to get up in the last jump. MERITOCRACY was chasing the leaders early, raced three wide and rallied when asked in the stretch, closed willingly,
took a short lead in deep stretch then was nailed on the line. SOMARA dueled for the lead while three wide, pushed away on the turn, responded to deep
stretch then was collared by MERITOCRACY and weakened. INCREDIBLY LUCKY was also outsprinted to the turn, raced three then then was inside the
