Footnotes
EL DIABLO ROJO settled off the pace, raced two wide into the bend, angled widest at the top of the stretch, drew alongside the leader nearing the eighth
pole, urged left-handed and drew clear at the sixteenth pole. HOLDEN THE LUTE stalked off the rail, bid three deep into stretch, took over in upper stretch
but could not stave off the winner in the final furlong. CROOKED FINGER RAY unhurried in the beginning, traveled four wide around the turn, then showed
a mild response to gain the show. GATE SPEED set the pace under pressure from outside, raced on even terms with DARK PRINCE midway around the
turn, lost command past the quarter pole and gave way. DARK PRINCE prompted the pace from outside, headed rival at the five-sixteenths, took command
past the quarter pole, offered no resistance to HOLDEN THE LUTE in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
QUIET SECRETARY stalked the leader in the two path, loomed three wide into the stretch, ranged up and took over nearing the eighth pole, kicked clear
inside the furlong grounds and held safely. LADY NOGUEZ traveled near the back of the pack, went three to four wide around the final turn, rallied and
gained the place honors. KEPT WAITING angled in early, pulled around the clubhouse turn then a bit on the backstretch before settling into stride, went
between runners into the far turn, exited that bend two wide, angled out in the stretch then came back in some and gained the show. SO MUCH HAPPY
sped clear and controlled the pace, led clear into the stretch, was overtaken with a furlong to go and got edged for the show. COVER VERSION trailed the
field early, went three wide into the drive and passed tired foes. SOPHIE ANTOINETTE tracked the pace off the rail, exited the far turn three wide and
weakened. COWBOYS DAUGHTER chased the speed from inside, started to weaken on the turn, tired in the lane, then came out and was eased late.

Footnotes
DARK HEDGES set the pace early inside of OLD INDIAN TRICK, battled with that rival through the turn and into the lane, cleared in upper stretch and drew
away under hand urging. DEFENSE WINS stalked off the rail then between rivals, traveled in the two path on the turn then came out into the stretch, rallied
and closed the gap on the winner while gaining second. OLD INDIAN TRICK forced the pace from outside into, around the turn and into the stretch, could
not match the winner in the final furlong and got outfinished for second. STRIKE IT LUCKY stalked the pace from inside, saved ground to the stretch then
angled out and weakened. LEPRINO raced in the two path into the turn, angled four wide into the stretch, drifted back to the inside in the drive and lacked
further response. PRINCEOFTHENORTH sat off the pace well off the rail early, went five wide into the turn, moved into the four path then came five into the
stretch and never rallied. RED VALOR chased behind the top pair to the outside, took the turn four then three wide and lacked a rally. BLAME IT ON KITTY
never got involved.

Footnotes
IAN GLASS was closest in pursuit early, closed in on the leader in upper stretch, took command approaching the eighth pole, lost the lead soon after
passing the furlong marker, battled back inside IRISH HEATWAVE and won the bob at the wire. IRISH HEATWAVE settled off the pace, advanced two wide
around the far turn, rallied three wide in the lane, struck the front inside the eighth pole, fought with IAN GLASS through the final furlong and got outnodded.
FRENCH GETAWAY traveled near the back of the pack, raced in the two path then angled out and traveled four wide in upper stretch, showed a mild
response and gained the show. MO BOB (IRE) bobbled leaving the gate, went three then two wide around the first turn, angled to the inside on the
backstretch, saved ground into the lane and kept on for a minor award. BLACKOUT (FR) opened up a comfortable lead early, remained well clear into the
stretch, was caught nearing the furlong grounds and gave way. WORTHY TURK trailed the field early, raced near the inside then moved out off the rail into
the far turn, came two wide into the stretch and proved no menace. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) tucked inside on the first turn, was eased around the second
bend, pulled up in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT JAMBOREE had early speed outside the top pair then dropped back to stalk off the rail, went three then two wide around the far turn, reeled in
the leader in upper stretch and drew off under mild urging. LADY O'PRADO set the pace with company to the outside, kicked clear on the backstretch,
padded the lead around the far turn, held a diminishing lead into the drive, caught by the winner in upper stretch and stayed on to prove second best.
REALREALGOOD lagged behind early, raced three wide then came out into the stretch and gained third. ENRICHED BY DEB pressed the pace from
outside early then chased LADY O'PRADO up the backstretch, raced a bit off the rail into the drive and tired. HALF-MILE AND THREE-QUARTER
FRACTIONS WERE HAND TIMED.

ALMOST A FACTOR stalked outside a rival, ranged up three deep on the far turn, cleared rivals past the quarter pole and held safely. KLEEN KARMA
tracked outside a rival early, advanced three wide around the second bend, finished willingly and outkicked ROSE'S CRYSTAL for the place. ROSE'S
CRYSTAL tracked two wide into the first turn, went outside a rival on the backstretch, exited the far turn four wide and got edged for second. SCARLET
HEAT forwardly placed in the early going and was placed near the inside, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out and lacked the needed bid. SECRET
SQUARE tracked the pace from inside, angled around rival on the far turn, came two wide into the lane and improved position. PUSHING SIXTY shifted out
and bumped rival at he start, showed early speed outside a rival, dropped back a bit to stalk before applying pressure on the backstretch, put a nose in front
at the seven-sixteenths pole, lost command past the five-sixteenths and faded. PEACE PIPE up close early outside the top pair, bid three deep at the
three-eighths pole, could not keep up into the lane and tired. Y NOT SIZZLE got bumped and shuffled back at the start, moved inside, angled out nearing
the second turn, angled four wide into the stretch, was eased in the lane and walked off. NAVY QUEEN showed speed from inside, cleared outside rivals
then got pressure again on the backstretch, lost command at the seven-sixteenths pole, steadied inside at the three-eighths, dropped back around the turn,
was eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
SHE'S A DIME set the pace with KRISTI'S TIGER to the outside to the stretch, kicked clear of that rival in upper stretch and stayed strong under a drive to
the wire. KRISTI'S TIGER pressed the pace from outside to the lane, could not match the winner late and held the place. LITTLE MISS ELLIE unhurried in
the early going, tracked three then two wide around the turn, angled to the rail at the top of the lane and finished willingly. HOMEHOME stalked between
rivals, two to three wide around the turn and never rallied. SILK FROM HEAVEN took a bad step at the nine-sixteenths and had the rider lost the right-iron
briefly, went four to five into the stretch and weakened. TIME FOR EBBY well placed behind the top pair from inside, raced in tight through the turn, and
weakened. LA AGUILILLA stalked three deep early, went three then four wide around the turn and faded.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT MYSTERY stalked the pace from inside, waited behind the top pair on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, struck the front in upper
stretch, cleared at the eighth pole and was kept to task in the final furlong. MCWHERTER brushed leaving the gate, dueled for the lead from outside, took
over at the quarter pole, led clear into the stretch, could not contain offer resistance to the winner but was clearly second best. INCH took a bad step
crossing over surfaces early, traveled off the rail then angled inside, lacked room behind rivals through the turn, gained a clear path entering the stretch,
tipped out two wide and finished well for the show. CAPO MAFIOSO reserved in the early going, raced between runners then entered the turn two wide,
angled out into the four path then steered back inside in upper stretch and lost the show. PRINCE MAGICIAN was in range early on, raced two wide into the
turn then moved out into the four path and lacked further response. ME MACHO traveled near the back of the pack off the inside, advanced four to five wide
around the bend and flattened out. MR VERRACITY jumped the track crossing surfaces early, saved ground from inside then shifted out at the top of the
lane and was never a factor. ARRIVEDERCI ROMA entered the turn three wide, moved into the two path around the turn, steered out in upper stretch and
had little left. STIR THE POT brushed with rival leaving the gate, dueled for the lead from inside, inched ahead past the seven-sixteenths then dueled again
around the turn, lost command at the quarter pole and tired in the stretch.
