Footnotes
SUPER WILDCAT ducked in at the break then tapered to the inside to set a pressured pace, rounded the turn at the rail and dug in under an all out drive to
hold on. MISSION TRAIL chased the pace inside and raced at the rail on the turn, dueled for second past the eighth pole and was gaining on the winner.
HEATED was bumped at the break then picked up the chase, came through the turn about the four path then outfinished in the stretch duel for second.
TWISTED STORIES broke in the air then angled in to make contact with Heated, picked up the chase outside, raced in the five path of the turn and finished
evenly. MPEMBA steadied off the heels of Mission Trail nearing the three eighths pole then picked up the chase past the pole, rounded the turn near the
rail, eased outward toward the head of the lane and raced evenly through the stretch. BLUE ABBI ROAD pressured the pace, rounded the turn off the rail
but drifted into the stretch and weakened. SUPER MALIBU gave chase and raced in the six path of the turn. COOKIES AND CREAM gave chase and raced
in the seven path of the turn.

Footnotes
CLUBIN TILL DAWN angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure into the far turn, was steadily handled to late stretch then taken in hand
later yards. CHARITABLE MISS raced off the pace inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, then
couldn't improve further. C V'S CAMPFIRE raced well off the early pace, started a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the
three path and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. QUINCYS WAY settled off the pace about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole
and raced at the rail on the far turn, but proved empty down the lane. KEEP LOVING raced well off the pace toward the inside and showed little response
through the backstretch. WHOSE THAT LADY saved early ground then left the first turn outside and showed little response. MASTERDANCER broke
awkwardly and rounded the first turn about the four path, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole then faded in the three path of the far turn.

Footnotes
JEN'S ORPHAN chased the pace toward the inside and raced at the rail on the turn, eased out entering the stretch, took the lead mid-stretch and held on
under steady encouragement. CLASSY SMITTY chased the pace outside, was carried outward toward the head of the lane and brushed by Ocho in the
vicinity of the eighth pole, but recovered stride to get up for second under the wire. MIO D' EVEN chased the pace and raced at the rail on the turn, briefly
occupied second later yards but was nipped from that position under the wire. CESAR AUGUSTO chased the pace and rounded most of the turn off the rail,
bore out toward the head of the lane, though recovered stride, and finished evenly. OCHO chased the pace through the backstretch and raced in the four
path most of the turn, drifted toward the head of the lane and made contact with Classy Smitty in the vicinity of the eighth pole, angled in from there and
flattened stride. WINDSOR'S FUN drew off to a long early lead, was steadily pressured leaving the turn but gave way nearing the sixteenth pole. LUCA'S
DREAM gave chase and raced at the rail on the turn. MY FINAL NINJA and LUFTI'SBROKENHEART were not factors.

Footnotes
WINDSOR'S CHAMPION was hustled along to set a pressured pace two deep, and endured a long drive from the gate to edge clear later yards. CARSON
CASTLE pressured the pace inside, dueled gamely to late stretch before flattening stride and just held on for second. BRONZE DIVA gave chase, raced in
the three path of the turn, eased four wide into the stretch, dueled for third mid-stretch and just missed second. DIAMOND TRAIN chased the pace through
the backstretch, rounded the turn at the rail and passed a rival in the lane. MISS GRANDSTANDER chased the pace inside, raced at the rail on the turn,
eased three wide into the stretch but flattened out inside the sixteenth pole. MISS WAVE chased the pace outside, rounded the turn about the five path and
showed little more. U S FUNDS chased the earlier pace inside, angled to the seven path on the turn and showed little more.

Footnotes
ISHIHARA saved early ground then eased out with a bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced three wide on the far turn, dug in from the head of
the lane to take the lead mid-stretch, edged further ahead late yards and was taken in hand nearing the wire. CANDY INVASION settled back inside, bid
leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, dueled at even terms through the stretch, though reluctantly ceded later yards.
RETURN TO ME rated close to the early pace two deep and moved to even terms into the backstretch, dueled from that point and took a slim brief lead in
the vicinity of the eighth pole, continued close through the upper stretch but weakened the final sixteenth. IN THE GOSPEL rated a slim early lead inside
and was met into the backstretch, dueled from that point and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, raced close through the upper stretch then
weakened inside the sixteenth pole. FREEDOM RIDER raced in the four path the first turn and stalked into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn two deep then weakened. LAST PARTY stalked the early pace three wide, but dropped back leaving the first turn and
faded through the backstretch. RIMINI raced off the pace about the three path the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and showed little response. JUBA
EARLY became a bit edgy in the gate and raced in the four and five paths the first turn, left the turn outside and showed little response.

MISSIONSNINETYNINE rushed up between horses to take the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, angled in past the three
eighths, raced at the rail on the turn then drew off under a steady drive. ENTRY TIME chased the pace toward the inside, rounded the turn off the rail then
eased three wide into the stretch, dug in through the final furlong and took second later yards. VIDMER'S COURAGE was hustled along with a brief early
lead then gave chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the turn off the rail then flattened stride while ceding second later yards. JUBA'S FANCY
chased the leaders outside, raced in the four path of the turn then flattened stride the final furlong. A BIT OF HARLOW gave only distant early chase then
bore out entering the turn. MISTER DEEKS chased the leaders toward the inside, rounded the turn off the rail then weakened. STOLEN BIZ gave chase but
faded at the rail through the turn. ROCKET BLUE hesitated then broke in the air, was slow getting into stride and raced well back. CRISTIANO BOY was
carried wide into the turn and never factored.

Footnotes
UPSY DAISY DO saved ground off the pace then eased slightly out into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced three wide on the far turn,
dueled to the front inside the sixteenth pole and was inching further ahead nearing the wire. LADY MADISON rounded the first turn about the three path and
stalked from the seven eighths pole, challenged nearing the three eighths and gave chase from that point, took the edge two deep toward the head of the
lane, gave up the edge past the sixteenth pole and reluctantly ceded. WAKES UP HAPPY took the lead three wide into the opening turn and rated the pace,
came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the turn at the rail but gave up control toward the head of the lane and flattened stride. PAINT
IT GREEN settled off the rail early on, eased out into the backstretch and made a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then
weakened. WHIZ PASS raced well off the early pace in the three and four paths, left the second turn toward the outside, bid nearing the three eighths pole
and raced in the four path of the far turn, then weakened. DYNACASTLE rounded the first turn off the rail and settled off the pace from the seven eighths
pole, eased out with a bid into the backstretch but showed little response. CITY BIRD FLYING was slow into stride and raced well back. COLD HEARTED
GAL rounded the opening turn in the four path, saved ground into the second turn but showed little response through the backstretch. BEYOND PRETTY
rounded the opening turn about the four path and stalked from the seven eighths pole, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths, then weakened off
the rail on the far turn. LIL SWEETHEART stalked the pace inside for about a half mile then faded through the backstretch.

BRIBERY raced well reserved off the rail, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and steadily gained to get up the
final yards. LIKE SEGAL stalked the pace off the rail, challenged toward the three eighths pole and took the lead at the quarter, contested the edge two
deep on the far turn, raced clear mid-stretch but was caught in the final yards. TRIPLE TITOS rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure at the three
eighths pole and was caught at the quarter, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail rounding the far turn, dropped back mid-stretch and flattened
later yards. RRACE DAY WARRIOR settled off the pace saving ground, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn
and could only close the gap through the stretch. BERMONDSEY hesitated at the break and raced off the pace in the two and three paths, picked up the
chase nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn at the rail then weakened.

Footnotes
MAN OF THE NIGHT tapered to the inside to take the lead into the first turn and rated the pace at mostly even terms, dueled from the three eighths pole
and contested the far turn still at even terms nearest the rail, then dug in under steady encouragement to edge away from YESIKNOWWHOIAM, who raced
with the pace and had a slim lead between calls, dueled from the three eighths pole and contested even terms two deep on the far turn, but dropped back
past the eighth pole and had to settle for second. WEAVING YOU BEHIND settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole
and raced off the rail on the far turn, then dug in through the stretch to take third the final yards. GENESIS G G stalked the earlier pace about the three path,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, then flattened stride the final sixteenth. THORN OF ROSE HILL saved
ground off the pace the opening turn, eased out into the backstretch and bid only mildly. GHOST MINE saved ground through the opening turn, picked up
the chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, then weakened. COCKY WINCHILL raced well back off the rail the first turn
and eased out into the backstretch, showed little response and ran wide on the far turn. SPRING DELIGHT drifted into the first turn and raced well back.
THERE THERE saved ground the first turn and faded past the five sixteenths pole.
