Footnotes
TYREEK stalked the pace, was three deep leaving the turn, took the lead near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. BALTIMORE BUD hugged the inner rail
set a pressed pace and faded late. MAKE US SMILE , rank soon after the break, drifted to the five path entering the stretch and rallied. DISTANT
THUNDER prompted the pace outside BALTIMORE BUD to upper stretch then weakened. ROYAL TRUMPET lacked speed, raced in the two path on the
turn and steadily retreated. SHIPLAKE chased the pace and gave way mid way on the turn.

Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE'S ON ICE advanced inside rivals leaving the chute and took command, set a rated pace two to three wide, came under pressure in upper
stretch, kept on under strong handling through the final furlong and held sway. WATCHTHEBOURBON stalked three wide, was four wide under asking into
the lane and closed steadily to gain. EL ROJO edged up the rail nearing the five eighths and tracked the winner, chased with aim into the lane but lacked a
solid finish. POLITICAL , off the pace while between rivals, shifted wide for the drive and kept trying. BIG RINNE , carried out a bit at the break, raced within
range and under coaxing leaving the half mile marker, moved up some while between rivals in the drive then flattened out. FIND YOUR BOAZ saved ground
and lacked a bid. FOREFRONT came out at the break, chased and gave way. CRESCENT WARRIOR broke a bit slowly, was used wide nearing the turn
and faltered.

PASSAGE OF LINES saved ground on the turn, eased out to the two path turning for home, split horses inside the sixteenth pole and drove clear. SAN
ANTONE stalked the pace, was three wide entering the stretch, advanced to gain a brief lead near the sixteenth pole then weakened. COHODES , sent to
the front after stumbling at the break, set the pace slightly off the rail and tried the final sixteenth of a mile. DANG IT lacked speed, was three deep turning
for home and failed to be a factor. TIZ GOLDEN saved ground on the turn, chased the pace and gave way.

Footnotes
PROMENADE PRINCESS tracked a contested early pace while racing in the clear and towards the inside, eased out and bid three deep to take command
into the lane, spurted clear under a drive in mid stretch then held firm while kept to task. AWARD WANTED was rated off the pace, ranged up four wide
outside rivals entering the lane, had aim in the winner in mid stretch and churned on willingly to bridge the gap. RAN CHAR settled inside, eased out mid
turn, moved up three wide between rivals then was stalled near the three sixteenths, got back going in mid stretch and continued with some interest. TOMA
, off the pace while saving ground, gathered momentum cutting the corner into the stretch, checked when lacking room soon after, found room along the rail
in mid stretch and finished with good energy. HOT CHOICE lacked speed while outside a rival mid turn, angled four wide into the lane but lacked a rally.
LOOKIN FOR CANDY , rushed to the front and dropped in to secure the rail, was headed after a quarter mile, chased around the turn, mild rebid into the
lane, failed to continue nearing mid stretch and gave way. VILLAMOURA , very reluctant to load, stumbled outward at the break, regrouped and moved up
outside rivals, took command with a half mile remaining, edged away some mid turn, was collared past the quarter pole and faltered soon into the stretch.

Footnotes
SUE LOVES BARBADOS saved ground around the turn, bumped with IMAGINE HONGKONG when coming out to the two path in upper stretch, closed
outside the leader to take command near the sixteenth pole and drew clear. IMAGINE HONGKONG lacked speed, hugged the inner rail around the turn,
eased out to the two path in mid stretch and rallied nicely. FOLE'S NOTION lacked speed, raced in the five path in upper stretch, bumped RAPID
RESPONSE when drifting out near the eighth pole and rallied mildly. FRANCIS X. chased the pace, was three wide turning for home, bumped with the
winner in upper stretch, failed to rally and drifted in late. LADNEEDSAHANDLER sprinted to the early lead, angled in, set the pace along the inner rail and
gave way. RAPID RESPONSE hopped slightly at the break, circled the turn, was in the six path when bumped by FOLE'S NOTION in mid stretch and
lacked a bid. NO IMAGINATION trailed. An objection by the rider of FRANCIS X. against SUE LOVE BARBADOS for alleged interference in upper stretch
was not allowed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run in upper stretch but no action was taken.

Footnotes
IN THE LOOP dueled inside on a short early lead, was headed near the turn, regained command while in a battle with two rivals to his outside, shook clear
under a drive in upper stretch, was kept to solid encouragement to the sixteenth marker then coasted home in the final forty yards. JOSEF IS REAL rated
behind rivals in about the two path, dropped to the rail around the turn, followed the winner into the lane, eased out and kept on gamely to save the place.
ABUELO PAPS , three wide between rivals early, gave pursuit around the turn, moved up some past the three sixteenths, steadied briefly when put in close
near the furlong pole, recovered and churned on. ABSOLVED drafted back off the contested pace, saved ground and was put to a solid ride past the three
eighths, swung five wide for the drive but failed to generate a legitimate kick. BAND ON TOUR was hung out four wide in pursuit of the leaders, ranged up to
threaten three furlongs out, forced the issue into the lane, drifted in while unable to kick on in mid stretch then faded. THE REVENGER dueled outside the
winner, held a slim lead leaving the far turn, vied between runners past the quarter pole then surrendered through the drive.

business. ALL ABOUT AUDREY bore out leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the turn, eased out turning for home and rallied mildly.

leaving the starting gate, raced five deep around the turn and passed tired foes. DIAL EMMA REILLY , checked in traffic mid way on the turn, was not a
factor. POPEYE'S OYL , four wide on the turn, weakened. LADY MAGNOLIA raced in the three path between horses on the turn and weakened. GRACE N

Footnotes
WONDERWALL settled outside a rival, took closer order nearing the far turn, awaited some room soon after, rolled up outside the leaders approaching the
stretch, opened up after being put to a drive past the three sixteenths, widened with alacrity and proved much the best. JOURNEYTOTHEMOON rated
inside, eased out advancing past the five sixteenths, lodged a mild bid near the quarter pole, kept on with some effort and managed to get the nose bob for
the place. LOVE IN HER EYES sped to command early on, handled outside pressure before going clear, set a rated pace, met challenges past the quarter
pole, gave way grudgingly and lost the bob for second money. MARVELLA NASTY dropped well back while saving ground past the three quarter pole,
swung five wide under pressure into the stretch but lacked a solid kick. BETCHA BY GOLLY , off the pace, gained while angling out past the three eighths,
chased into the stretch then faded. GUNS BLAZING , a bit keen forcing the issue between rivals, stayed in range to the five sixteenths then weakened.
CHAMPAGNE TOAST broke a step slow and was outrun. TUFF BUT FAIR , three deep prompting the early pace, failed to kick on leaving the half mile
marker and faltered.

Footnotes
CANDYGRAMFORMONGO accelerated to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail and was kept to his business in the drive. DIVINE INTERVENTIO
raced forwardly in the three path between horses around the turn, chased the winner through the stretch and finished willingly. NOVA BOY lacked speed,
raced outside horses on the turn, drifted to the seven path in upper stretch and offered a mild rally. KINGSTON PIKE , briefly steadied in close quarters
entering the turn, angled out mid way on the bend, was fanned to the eight path in upper stretch then finished willingly. BLOW THE WHISTLE raced
between horses in the stretch drive and passed tired ones. CRUSH IT , in the two path on the turn while chasing the pace, weakened in the drive.
THREETHEHARDWAY , a forward factor along the inner rail on the turn, weakened in the stretch. UNMATCHABLE raced along the inner rail on the turn
and was never a factor. FAST MASTER , four deep on the turn, gave way in upper stretch.
