looming into upper stretch, proved no match the final sixteenth holding as a clear second best. WROTE'S GIFT slow early gained on the far turn racing
evenly through the lane. DARLING BELLE gained four wide to upper stretch hanging late. SHEZA MEAN BROAD slow early played no factor. BETTER
VIBES raced mid pack never reaching contention. LET'S GO LUNA was always outrun. DISCREET ENERGY moved on pace weakening on the far turn
giving way into upper stretch. LYNNE T tracked for a half mile then folded up on the far turn.
