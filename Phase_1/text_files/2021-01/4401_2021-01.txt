clear through the final sixteenth. BAAQEYA ducked out leaving the gate, angled to the rail while chasing the early leader, gave her best into the final furlong
but couldn't match the winner. REIN SUPREME made a two wide run on the turn, vied between rivals into the final turn then flattened out. MARY COSTA
opened a clear lead soon after the break, stayed out from the rail and tired in the lane. BEAUTIFUL SUCCESS stayed inside and failed to menace.
PLATINUM AFFAIR lagged into the stretch and failed to menace. MISS TSCHETTER broke in the air, lugged in, brushed CHORNAYAH KRACOTA early
on the backstretch then tired. CHORNAYAH KRACOTA was brushed early on the backstretch and stopped early.

EVEN THUNDER fell back along the rail on the backstretch, raced two wide around the turn, moved to a short lead outside the leaders entering the final
sixteenth and held under urging. EAGLE PASS wasn't far back, vied in the three path around the final turn and through the lane but couldn't stay late with
the winner. WAHOOWA WAHOOWA set or forced the pace in the two path and faltered in the lane. BOYS OF QUEENS was caught in tight along the rail
around the first turn and failed to menace. STRONG BREEZE made the early pace inside and was finished after five furlongs. STADIUM was outrun. KISS

Footnotes
COURTING JENNY settled, rallied the four path around the turn, lugged in sharply while barley clear nearing the final sixteenth and widened under urging.
CALS MY PAL lagged early, swung wide between rivals into the stretch and finished with good energy. DIAMOND MOON showed speed in the two path,
moved clear early on the turn, checked nearing the final sixteenth and faded. An objection by Hernandez against the winner was not allowed. TIZ
PROMISING RVF was slow early, circled into the stretch and made up some ground. SUNSHINE BAY wasn't far back inside and tired. KAY SYRAH
SYRAH came out three wide for room nearing the stretch and lacked a strong closing. LADY JOANNA was outrun. OCEAN CONQUEST chased in the
three path into the turn then stopped.
