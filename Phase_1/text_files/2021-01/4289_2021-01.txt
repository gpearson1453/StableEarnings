GRAPE SODA coaxed from the gate, vied outside a pair briefly before emerging to duel with SPEECHIN N TEACHIN from the four path down the
backstretch, went three wide through the turn continuing to knock heads, swung three to four wide into upper stretch shaking off his main pace rival and was
roused straightened away, went clear under a drive to prevail. LOTSNLOTSOFCHROME chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. OHYOUDIDNTKNOW broke out at the
start, chased six then five wide under a ride from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and improved position for the show honors. BLACK
LIMO stumbled at the start, then got bumped by ROMANTIC MAN due to the pressure from a veering in LOOK OUT LAMBO and was taken in hand and
pinched between foes conceding five to six lengths to the front before being able to settle into stride, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked inside through the turn coming under urging at the seven-sixteenths, offered up a bid moving into prominence spinning three wide into upper stretch,
then tired in the drive. LOOK OUT LAMBO veered in at the start bumping ROMANTIC MAN into BLACK LIMO, then leaned on ROMANTIC MAN for a few
strides trading an additional bump after the start despite attempts of correction, chased three then two wide down the backstretch before tucking to the
inside through the turn, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. SPEECHIN N TEACHIN vied briefly inside a pair
before emerging to duel three then two wide with GRAPE SODA to his outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into
upper stretch shaken off and faltered. ROMANTIC MAN got bumped at the start by the veering in LOOK OUT LAMBO and in turn bumped BLACK LIMO
pinching that rival out against SPEECHIN N TEACHIN and conceding four lengths to the front, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then
three to four wide through the turn, went four to five wide for home and gave way. MISTER J T showed brief speed from the four path between foes vying for
command, got shaken off and chased two to three wide through the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
ELEGANT ZIP away without apparent mishap, was under a hold while forwardly placed along the inside route, slipped by the leader midpoint on the turn,
edged away from the field, still held in reserve and with all of the closest pursuers being roused in varying degrees themselves, struck the three-sixteenths
pole and was turned loose, responded and kicked clear. SKY KITTEN chased the pace from the two path, was set down shortly after the half had been
rattled off, inched inward in time to cut the corner into the stretch, altered back into path two in midlane, got outfinished. NASTY AFFAIR far back displaying
no speed, came under the whip by the three-eighths pole, still lingered along, slithered its way towards path four stepping into the stretch, took off when let
out a notch in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, maintained that burst of energy en route for show honors. ANYDAYISHERDAY stalked the pacesetter
from path three for the opening half, saw the top one take charge as the second split was being finalized, came under stronger handling a sixteenth later,
commenced the stretch one path wider, backed away. SWEET MIA established the top, showed the way coaxed in path two, proved powerless when
confronted by ELEGANT ZIP at the midway point of the turn, failed to re-claim the lead when quickly put to a drive, swung out approximately three wide
stepping onto the top of the lane, retreated. HAPPY SOPHIA two to three wide on the bend, angled into path five for the drive, launched no bids.

Footnotes
FROST ME led early on in hand until displaced from command six furlongs from home, chased five then four wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch seizing command straightened away, inched clear under a drive, dug in and held safe to prevail.
SHANES PRETTY LADY broke out at the start and was corrected, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through
the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to be along well clear of the rest and second best.
CARA'S DREAMER brushed the off side stall at the start, advanced to prompt the leader from the outside four then three wide, advanced to take command
inside the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, got displaced from the front straightened away and weakened. OUT FIRST stumbled at the start,
chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. PONCHO SONG chased just off the
inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, made no impact. BEACH BANKER broke out at the start, raced forwardly placed
just off the inside advancing to take command six furlongs from home, showed the way under some pressure from CARA'S DREAMER to the outside,
tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths before being headed for the front inside that station, spun just off the inside for
home and tired.

TAINO bumped with SPY STORY after striking the side of the gate, departed the backstretch four to five wide, angled five to six wide turning into the lane,
kicked in and began to inch up to the ones to catch, steadied slightly altering a bit wider at the furlong grounds to steer safely by the fallen rider, effortlessly
rolled by a troubled pair a short distance inside the eighth pole and drew off smartly. BEATTHATFLEW took up the chase two wide on the turn, was on the
outer border of that path heading onto the top of the lane, resumed its rally in earnest once past the fallen rider of ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE in midstretch to
procure the place. IN THE ZONE kept watch on the contested pace from the pocket, was more in path two spinning onto the head of the stretch, was
steadied and tipped towards the rail after the incident at the furlong grounds, flattened out so as to have to settle for the show. OUT OF TUNE assumed a
forward position, was two wide in between rivals contending for the top beginning from the general area of the nine-sixteenths pole, got let loose as the half
was being completed, was still arguing from between foes when knocked hard and to the left by an errant ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE just beyond the
three-sixteenths pole, got checked, narrowly escaping some additional contact with CAPE COD GEM, never regained real interest. LITTERBOX three wide
onrto the turn, got sent out five wide exiting it, mustered up a mild stretch response. CAPE COD GEM remained stationed along the inside route, was the
innermost of a threesome disputing the pace beginning near the conclusion of the backstretch, got set down for the drive, checked after its fellow pace
combatants bumped into each other leaving the three-sixteenths pole, never regained much interest. TAPITENA mostly two wide on the turn, was closer to
the rail at the top of the lane, made no headway. KISS'N MISSION spotted along the inside, was already under a hand ride by the three-eighths pole, never
made its presence felt. PRINCE ORB in range four wide, steadied to avoid to a spill at the furlong grounds, had no rally. INDIANS IMAGE away sluggishly
after appearing hesitant at the start, brought up the back of the pack at or near path two, went eight wide into the lane under a protective hold and was
allowed to fade away. SPY STORY underwent a two wide pursuit, swung out about five wide into the lane, took bad steps while retreating in hand in deep
stretch, losing the rider, then was vanned off the finish. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE tucked into the three path, vied as the widest of three from the
nine-sixteenths pole to upper stretch, began to lug in after stepping onto the top one, ducked in sharply in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, losing its
pilot after making solid contact with OUT OF TUNE, was subsequently apprehended and walked off the track. Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the
stretch run, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
BEACH ACCESS three wide in aim of the leader, prompted that rival from the outside in the two path through the turn patiently handled, spun just off the
inside for home taking over command, got roused straightened away and edged away under a drive to prevail. OTHER THINGS EQUAL chased along the
inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and offered up a
mild kick to just secure the place honors in the final jumps. FLATEXCEL established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the rail half a mile from home and came under increasing pressure through the turn from the eventual winner to the outside, got put to
coaxing at the five-sixteenths in response, took the inside route into upper stretch displaced from command and kept on to the finish getting collared for the
place honors in the final jumps while clear of the rest. HERO'S HOPE stumbled at the start, recovered to chase four paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and weakened.
HARDCORE FOLKLORE chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and passed tired
rivals. REAL DAN five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung four to five
wide into upper stretch and weakened. THIS CAT CAN FLY chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping four wide through the turn, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three to four wide for home and made no impact. GAULTIER (FR) struck the near side stall at the start before
brushing with ORPHEUS, chased four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued four wide for home and faltered. AUTOSTRADE chased
just off the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole, continued in the two path into upper stretch and tired. ORPHEUS (ARG) brushed at the start by the
inward breaking GAULTIER, chased six then five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CARILLO pinched after being bumped from both sides, settled into the three path, chased the pace towards midpack, swung into action by swinging four
wide into the stretch, took charge by the end of the run through the furlong grounds and kicked clear. AL'S PRINCE tracked the pace from the rail for nearly
a half, got taken to the outside for the drive, gradually made its way into path four rallying for the place. INSPIRATION POINT cut over to the inside route,
argued for command as the innermost of three until midstretch, weakened into the show slot. COST AVERAGE bumped in the shadow of the starting gate,
pursued the front runners from path two in between foes on the turn, angled four wide for the drive, had no punch. THE REDS in the start, got corrected but
not before making some contact with another, secured a prominent position, contended from path three versus a pair of rivals to his inside for the
advantage, got ridden into the lane, kept up his quest in earnest for another furlong then backed away. ASK NEAL rode the rail, was under encouragement
during the run around the bend, angled towards path three heading for three-sixteenths pole, had no rally. OFFICIATING sent into path two, vied from
between opponents for a good portion of the initial six furlongs, faltered. LOCHINVAR (GER) lost its footing springing from the gate, raced two to three wide
on the turn, ventured eight wide into the lane having been placed to a protective hold and was allowed to fade away.

Footnotes
WUDDA U THINK NOW three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide for home, rallied to
issue a challenge a furlong out taking narrow command inside the eighth pole, dueled through to the finish holding gamely to the advantage. PRINCE OF
PHAROAHS coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and was
set down straightened away, dug in under threat and was headed inside the eighth pole, fought on dueling inside to the finish and was along clear of the
rest and second best. NOTORIOUS FLIRT three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch,
kept on to secure the show honors while never threatening the top pair. RAVEN ROCKS hustled from the gate, chased two to three wide down the
backstretch, tucked inside through the turn coming under urging at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened. SARATOGA PAL five
then four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the turn, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. TIZ KAZ NOW chased four then three wide under
coaxing from three furlongs out, cornered four wide for home and tired. TROUBLESHOOTER coaxed from the start, chased three wide under urging from
the seven-sixteenths, went five wide at the head of the stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
WILD BANKER taken hold of after lunging springing from the starting gate, moved up into contention on the backstretch, departed it from path three,
continued to make progress during the run around the bend, got set down leaving the five-sixteenths pole, grabbed charge soon after spinning into the lane,
felt the presence of the second place finisher in the final stages, held sway. DUST DEVIL along the outside, stepped onto the turn two to three wide, flashed
some interest tipping into path four coming up to the midway point of the turn, was switched over to stronger handling turning into the stretch, gained ground
in a steadfast manner, fell short. AMISTAD tracked the front runners from near the inside for almost three-quarters, was under urging heading home, got
worked into path four from upper to midstretch, went on to secure the show. LIAM'S FIRE bumped with I SAW IT ALL after bobbling slightly at the start, got
guided to the rail and rode it until the end of the bend, swung out approximately three wide into upper stretch, failed to make any late headway. KID
CHOCOLATE mostly two wide in pursuit of the pace for the opening six furlongs, got sent out into path six racing towards the three-sixteenths pole, gained
some, but all accomplished without much impact. STANHOPE bumped at the start, procured a forward position, contended for the top while saving ground,
got asked as three-quarters was being completed, relinquished shortly afterwards and backed away. PIER FORTY three wide onto the turn, fanned out into
path six exiting it, had no offering. BEACHSIDE strung out three to four wide on the turn, was moved out into path seven by midlane, failed to make his
presence felt. ALLIED INVASION at or near the inside keeping an eye on the front runners, angled five wide into the lane, gave way. I SAW IT ALL bumped
from both sides at the break, tucked along the inside, faltered after spinning into the stretch. QUINTARELLI two wide on the bend, folded after going
three-quarters. GRANDGRAN spotted two to three wide at the top of the turn, steadily retreated thereafter.
