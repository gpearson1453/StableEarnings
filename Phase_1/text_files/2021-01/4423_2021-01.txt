Footnotes
MYSTERY MESSENGER raced off the rail while within range, traveled two then three wide around the turn, rallied three deep and collared the leader at the
eighth pole, took over soon after and bested VIA EGNATIA in deep stretch under a drive. VIA EGNATIA chased the pace from inside, cut the corner into the
drive, rallied up the fence but got outkicked by the winner. APPRECIATED broke in and bumped rival, traveled along the inside to the turn, came out on the
bend and went four wide into the stretch, finished well and earned the show honors. ITSTHATTIME closest in pursuit from outside, asked three then two
wide around the turn, tipped out in upper stretch and flattened out. GOLDEN IMAGE sped clear early and moved into the two path, showed the way a bit off
the rail into the stretch, clung to the lead at the eighth pole but succumbed to pressure and weakened in the final furlong. KITTEN'S CAT stumbled badly at
the start, went two wide around the bend and showed some late response but never threatened. SELF TAUGHT bumped from outside at the start, saved
ground trailing the field and never got involved.

Footnotes
CASHLINGS took control quickly from inside, remained unchallenged to the stretch, put to right-handed urging in the lane, drew off and was under steady
handling in deep stretch. BOLU chased between early then off the rail, went three wide around the turn and was along for second. MUSICAL GEM stalked
outside a rival, had aim two wide behind the leader into the stretch but lacked the needed late kick and got outfinished for the place. PRESTO BENCH raced
off the pace outside a rival, entered the turn four wide then angled down to the two path through the bend, shifted to the rain in upper stretch and evened out
in the final furlong while earning a minor award. MR. TRIPLEDOUBLE broke in a bit at the start, raced off the pace, took the turn two wide then shifted into
the three path at the top of the lane and proved no menace. HE BE DANGEROUS forwardly placed in the beginning, traveled two wide then angled in on
the turn while losing ground and weakened in the drive. LILI'S BOY chased the leader along the inside, dropped back on the turn and tired.

urging. JAN'S RESERVE tracked widest up the backstretch, went five wide through the bend, finished willingly and outnodded rival for the place.
AWHITESPORTSCOAT stalked outside a rival, three to four wide to the stretch and got outnodded for the place. BLACK STORM chased from inside,
lacked room behind rival near the three-eighths pole, angled around for and came two wide into the stretch and kept on to secure a minor share. TOBACCO
ROAD chased between then off the rail, lacked room at the five-sixteenths pole, exited the bend three wide and flattened out in the final furlong.
PORTANDO in range while four wide through the turn and weakened. LOLO PANIOLO set the pace under pressure from both sides, dueled with the winner
around the turn, then faded in the lane. COSA NOSTRA (IRE) off a bit slow to begin, trailed early off the inside, angled five wide around the turn and
improved position. WRITE ME A SONG pressed the pace from inside to the three-eighths pole and faded. ROYAL SEEKER saved ground to the stretch and

Footnotes
HOCKEY DAD had early speed then dropped back to stalk behind the leader, collared foe at the eighth pole and drew clear. STANDING O sped to the front,
cleared HOCKEY DAD on the backstretch, showed the way to the stretch, challenged with a furlong to go and yielded to the winner. LIL RICARDO stumbled
a bit at the start, raced off the rail then angled to the inside and saved ground to the stretch, stayed inside in the drive and gained the show. GORDY'S BOY
stumbled a bit leaving the gate, chased off the rail then outside a rival and could not rally. MINEHUNTER chased along the fence through the turn and never
produced a bid. BOB DANIELS stumbled badly in the beginning, traveled outside a rival then three deep, went three then two wide around the turn and
could not offer a response when called upon. MARKSMAN ON TARGET settled off the pace, outside a rival through the turn and two wide into the drive and
was never a factor. ROYAL DUDE off a bit slow and came in at the start, tracked from inside and made no impact. BRAVESTONE off a bit slow to begin,
reserved in the early stages, took the turn two wide and never reached contention. MOSBY lost path soon after the start, went three wide into the stretch
and proved no menace.

Footnotes
CHEVELITA cleared quickly then stalked the leader from outside, bid alongside on the far turn, took over at the quarter pole and kicked clear of rival,
widened in the lane and took a bit of an awkward step when changing leads late. SIMMER DOWN pressed the pace from inside then cleared outside rival,
was challenged around the final turn, could not stave off the winner, drifted out in upper stretch and stayed on for a clear second. MADE IN KAROO angled
in on the first turn, stalked inside then angled out a bit and was asked two to three wide into the stretch but lacked further response. MALIBU JEWEL
bothered by rival at the start, traveled four to three wide then went between foes, entered the stretch two wide and could not rally. GEMSTONE GAL entered
clubhouse turn six wide then angled in a path around the bend, took the final turn four then three wide and could not rally. SIDEWAYS SUANCES broke out
and bumped rival leaving the gate, saved ground throughout and lacked the needed response. LADY MO shifted out at the start, chased three wide early
then three deep to the seven-sixteenths, went between runners around the final bend and weakened. TEQUILA DIVA bumped by rival leaving the gate,
traveled at the back of the field, went two wide around the far turn and was never a factor. I'M ALL THE JEDI traveled four to five wide around the first turn,
went five wide into the far turn then angled down to the three path and had little left.

CONSTANTIA bumped into rival and steadied at the start, settled off the pace and moved closer up the backstretch, angled out on the turn then further out
in the stretch, took over nearing the eighth pole and kicked clear. TROUVILLE bumped and steadied at the start, raced along the inside then came out on
the turn, went five wide into the stretch, rallied outside the winner but could go on with CONSTANTIA in deep stretch. LAVENDER (IRE) broke in and
bumped rival, angled in on the turn, came out in the stretch and finished willingly. ROSES AND CANDY tracked three to four wide around the bend, led
briefly in upper stretch before being overtaken approaching the eighth pole and flattened to a minor award. MAGICAL GRAY steadied early, stalked the
pace from inside, lacked room in upper stretch, angled out at the eighth pole and improved position. RATHER NOSY stalked along the rail then two wide
into the drive and weakened. CLARO QUE SI set the pace and crossed over to the inside, relinquished control in upper stretch and gave way.
ANONYMOUSLY was in range early on, entered the turn in the two path then angled to the rail and faded out of contention. JEN'S BATTLE chased three
deep into the turn, three wide leaving the bend, angled out in the drive and had nothing left. ELLIE ARROWAY up close outside the leader then raced
between into the turn, dropped back around the bend, faded in the stretch, bled following the race and walked off.

furlong. VA VA VEGAS dueled for the lead from inside, vied around the turn and into the stretch, could not go on with the winner in the final furlong but
stayed on to secure the place. SABUDA dueled outside VA VA VEGAS early, vied between foes around the turn, lost contact at the top of the stretch, tipped
out and held the show. GABBY HAYES chased four wide into the bend, angled down to the two path around the turn and lacked a serious bid. LESSONS
OF AUTISM chased from inside to the lane and weakened. BY MOONLIGHT tracked two wide through the turn and faded in the drive. ALEXANDER'S
DREAM broke in and bumped at the start, angled widest early, entered the turn five wide then angled in a few paths and weakened. RUN KING STUD RUN
