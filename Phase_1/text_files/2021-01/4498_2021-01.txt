Footnotes
WEEKEND DREAMER cleared off early on, drifted out slightly while meeting bids inside the final sixteenth, but lasted. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR stalked
along the inside, nudged his outer counterpart in midstretch to shift outside of the leader for clear racing room, produced a bid approaching the wire, but
missed. UNPRECEDENTED lied off of the pace early on, gained ground three wide and outside of foes through the turn, shifted four wide turning for home,
and sustained his long grinding advance through the lane to reach show. ALLEGEDLY PERFECT stalked the clear leader three to two wide, chased that foe
without making progress through the lane, got nudged and outkicked by his inner counterpart approaching the final sixteenth, then got outfinished for show
while under light urging approaching the wire. STAR WEAVER was off a step slow and got brushed between horses at the start, lied off of the pace in the
three to four path around the turn, shifted five wide turning for home, and produced a mild kick while hanging on his left lead through the lane, but failed to
achieve a minor placing. R MAN JOE saved ground while off of the pace, but to no avail. GUACO was off slowly, lagged behind the field around the turn,
swung to the six path turning for home, and improved past tired foes. NO BANG NO BOOM (IRE) lied forwardly placed two wide and between horses early
on, but began to retreat into the turn, and steadily faded thereafter. KOBE FIFTY TWO lied far off of the pace in the three path around the turn, and never
got involved.

Footnotes
LIFE IN SHAMBLES waited behind the leaders from midway on the turn to the five-sixteenths, moved out four wide taking aim approaching the stretch,
reached the front from outside into the final furlong and moved away, and was geared down the last 50 yards. BENEFACTOR advanced three wide to
challenge for command after a half-mile, gained a short lead outside STORM BOARDER and OLD TIME REVIVAL near the eighth-pole, could not kick on
with the winner and was clear of the rest. OLD TIME REVIVAL prompted the early pace, bid between horses coming to the quarter-pole, and weakened
through the last eighth of a mile. STORM BOARDER (CHI) unseated the rider in the post parade but was quickly apprehended, hustled to the lead inside
with an alert break, faced a trio of challengers a quarter-mile out, and gave way through upper stretch. DEPUTY CZAR was outrun inside. PUDDING raced
three to four wide, and faded after a half. GRAN OMERO (VEN) did not respond to early urging two wide, and was vanned off after the finish. MO HAWK
was finished early two to three wide.

Footnotes
DR. DUKE set the pace along the inside, felt stern pressure from a pair of foes around the turn, spurted clear from those rivals in upper stretch, then tired
late, flopped back to his left lead approaching the wire, but lasted. WORA was forced inwards by multiple foes and got bumped by his stablemate at the
start, lacked room inside of that rival to achieve early position, trailed the field along the inside, swung six wide straightening into the lane, and offered a
good kick to rally outside of foes for place, but ran out of ground to catch the leader. MY SEA COTTAGE (IRE) was forced inwards by an outer foe at the
start, bumped his inner stablemate in the process, advanced to midpack two wide and between horses into the turn, split foes in upper stretch, then stayed
while hanging on his left lead through the lane, but was outfinished by an outer foe for place. MUBTADAA broke inwards affecting multiple inner foes, shifted
outwards to press the pace three wide, came under coaxing at the three furlong pole to sustain pressing position, but failed to keep pace with the leader in
upper stretch while getting brushed twice by his most immediate inner foe, then chased the leaders home. HILLBILLY LOGIC broke outwardly to open
space, pressed the leader two wide, vied between horses around the turn, but drifted out under left handed urging in upper stretch, brushed his outer
counterpart twice in the process, then faded thereafter. SI COMO NO stalked along the inside, but failed to produce a bid before fading. GOLDEN SPOKE
bumped the gate at the start and was away last of all, lied off of the pace two to three wide and between horses into the turn, shifted four to five wide in
upper stretch, delayed his lead change to inside the furlong pole, and failed to mount a rally. PALEMMA lied off of the pace four wide around the turn, and
weakened around the five sixteenths grounds.

Footnotes
CHESS'S DREAM saved ground unhurried for six furlongs, slipped through on the fence in upper stretch to join the leaders, and kicked away through the
final furlong under good handling. NEVER SURPRISED took back from between ORIGINAL and KENTUCKY PHAROAH while a bit keyed up to the first
turn, settled down through the middle stages just outside CHESS'S DREAM and in striking range, swung four wide turning for home, and finished gamely
between horses to take a three-way place photo. ORIGINAL vied inside NEVER SURPRISED and KENTUCKY PHAROAH through the stretch the first time,
edged away into the backstretch establishing an even pace, came off the far turn in the two-path facing challenges from both flanks, and weakened through
the closing stages managing to save the show. SIGILOSO trailed a closely-knit group two to three wide to the stretch, and gained belatedly on the far
outside. KENTUCKY PHAROAH moved in from the three-path prompting outside ORIGINAL, lodged a bid after six furlongs, and weakened between rivals
through the last eighth of a mile. IT'S A GAMBLE turned in an even effort near the two-path, and did not menace.

Footnotes
MAN OF VISION stalked the leading duelers from the three path around the turn, bid for the lead outside of those foes at the quarter pole, forged an
advantage approaching the furlong marker, and drew clear late. KALU dueled for the lead inside of WEISSER, dug in turning for home as MAN OF VISION
made a menacing bid, but yielded to that foe inside the final sixteenth. WEISSER dueled for the lead outside of KALU, vied between horses turning for
home as MAN OF VISION ranged up, but weakened between those rivals at the furlong pole, and just saved show. SIESTA MOON tracked from midpack in
the four path, inched closer to the trio of leading foes passing the five sixteenths pole, but leveled off in upper stretch, then just missed reaching a tiring foe
for show. YOUNG RAYMOND tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted to the three path turning for home, and stayed on, but failed to threaten. DR
HARLAN lifted his head right before the gates opened and hesitated leaving them, lied off of the pace two wide, shifted from the three to five path turning for
home, but hung on his left lead and failed to menace. LAUDERDALE stumbled slightly at the start, lied off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the four
path turning for home, and failed to factor. MOZO BELLO lied far off of the pace three wide, and did not play a factor. KAREN'S COVE tracked from
midpack two wide and between horses into the turn, held tracking position from the two path around the bend, but weakened through the lane. FRANK
FIRST brushed the gate with is hind quarters at the start, then was outrun. TWO STEP SLEW lied far off of the pace four wide, and never got involved.

Footnotes
DRAIN THE CLOCK pressed POPPY'S PRIDE from outside, took over going comfortably after a half-mile, opened up into the stretch under a drive, and
was geared down 70 yards out. KING'S OVATION was outsprinted early, began moving past the midway point of the turn, lacked room and steadied briefly
between LIKEABLE and POPPY'S PRIDE approaching the head of the lane, got through between those two in upper stretch and rallied to go clear for the
place. ULTIMATE BADGER trailed early inside, came widest off the turn and offered a mild response. LIKEABLE broke inward, ran up behind the heels of
the leaders and was held up briefly past the three-quarter pole, moved out chasing three wide to the turn, got put to a drive outside the quarter-pole and was
empty with a furlong remaining. POPPY'S PRIDE set a pressured pace inside, yielded to the winner midway on the turn, and folded up. BY GEORGE
stayed in range four wide for a half, and had nothing left into the stretch.

Footnotes
KING OF DREAMS set the pace while well in hand and encountering mild pressure, kicked clear when asked straightening into the lane, and held sway.
AVENUE pressed three to two wide around the first turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader straightening into the lane, veered inwards under right
handed pressure shortly after, then chased the leader home, flopped back to his left lead inside the final sixteenth, and held place. FLY LIKE AN EAGLE
tracked from midpack shifting three to two wide around the first turn, inched closer turning for home, split foes and forged show in upper stretch as the
leader scooted away, then sustained a grinding rally through the lane, but failed to reach place. ACTION JACKSON lied far off of the pace in the two path,
then in the two to three path around the far turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and stayed on with a mild rally. ADVANCED PLACEMENT stalked four to
three wide around the first turn, but failed to keep pace with inner foes in upper stretch, and tired. PRAYER BOOK lied forwardly placed while caught five
wide into the first turn, shifted down to be four wide around that bend, but drifted to the seven path in upper stretch while fading. CHROME REPUBLIC lied
well off of the pace in the three path around both turns, and improved without factoring. SEIZING THE DREAM saved ground from midpack, shifted two
wide turning for home to surpass a tiring foe, but failed to sustain a rally. COUCH DREAMS lied at the rear of the field along the inside, but failed to get
involved. MAXIM MOMENT pressed the pace two wide into the first turn, tucked down to stalk along the inside around that bend, but came under coaxing
into the far turn, failed to respond, and was eased in upper stretch while weakening. JARLIAN was outrun.

Footnotes
TUNE IN saved ground on hold for six furlongs, moved out for room coming to the eighth-pole, responded readily and ran past the leaders from outside
under shaken reins and hand urging. AUSTRIAN broke a step slow, recovered to midpack three wide, advanced with a bid outside the leaders near the
quarter-pole, and finished willingly. LIGHT FURY grabbed the lead after the start, rated along inside, edged away turning for home, but yielded through the
last eighth of a mile. NOTSOSUBTLE bumped with MR. TIP shortly after the start, steadied lacking room inside going to the first turn, moved out leaving the
far turn and improved position without threatening. THE MIGHTY JUDGE raced in the second flight two wide to the stretch, and gained only mildly. SEIZE
THE HAY lagged well back to the stretch, and went by tired horses inside. UNCLE CURLY stayed in range two wide to the stretch, and tired. MR. TIP
lacked room after the start between SEMPER FI and NOTSOSUBTLE and bumped with the latter, raced three wide and was never prominent. SEMPER FI
prompted the pace outside LIGHT FURY, got scrubbed along from midway on the far turn, and gave way in upper stretch. BURN THE BOATS was reserved
tracking the leaders inside, and came up empty after six furlongs.

Footnotes
ZAAJEL got antsy waiting for the gates to open, then came out a step slowly when they did, gradually gained outside of rivals down the backstretch to
achieve a three wide stalking position at the half mile pole, inched closer around the turn to bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, forged an advantage
turning for home as DIAL TO WIN ranged up along side, repulsed that foe and drew clear approaching the final sixteenth, and safely held from LADY
TRAVELER late. LADY TRAVELER lied off of the pace three wide, got floated to the four to five path at the five sixteenths pole as an inner foe shifted
outwards, came under all out pressure to keep pace passing the quarter pole, finally responded to that urging in midstretch, and stayed on outside of tiring
rivals to claim place in the late stages. WHOLEBODEMEISTER broke outwards and pinched a foe at the start, lied forwardly placed along the inside, came
under a drive to hold position at the three furlong marker, slipped inside of the pace setter in upper stretch, and sustained an inside grinding rally while in
tight quarters along the rail, but was outfinished for place. DIAL TO WIN tracked from midpack two wide, shifted to the four path at the five sixteenths pole to
produce a bid for the lead outside of ZAAJEL turning for home, but was turned away by that rival approaching the final sixteenth, and tired. COACH JER'S
JOY broke inwards but was clear of her inner rival, stalked the pace setter two wide and from between horses, got outmoved by the eventual winner at the
five sixteenths pole, chased from behind that foe while between horses through the lane, and steadied mildly approaching the wire when her inner
counterpart slipped through. COMPETITIVE SPEED was bumped between horses at the start, lied off of the pace along the inside, took the turn in the two
to three path, then failed to mount a rally through the lane. THREE TIPSY CHIX was jostled between horses and pinched back at the start, trailed the field
along the inside, and was outrun. QUEEN ARELLA broke inwards and bumped a foe at the start, set the pace along the inside, but was headed at the
quarter pole, then got swallowed up between horses in upper stretch while being eased on her left lead.

Footnotes
WHITE FROST saved ground allowed to settle early, threaded through between horses getting in gear coming to the head of the stretch three wide, kicked
in strongly to overhaul CON LIMA from outside and edged clear. CON LIMA was a bit flat-footed at the break, quickly regrouped and grabbed the lead, rated
along inside to the stretch, could not contain the winner but held well to best the others. DOMAIN EXPERTISE went along in the second flight two wide to
the far turn, shifted out to the four-path getting her cue at the top of the stretch, finished with good energy but did not have enough. CANDACE O saved
ground forwardly placed to the stretch, and finished one-paced. HONEY PANTS lacked room and steadied heading to the first turn in the two-path, trailed
for six furlongs, angled widest into the lane and could not make an impact. QUEEN OF THE GREEN lacked room and steadied inside HONEY PANTS
going to the first turn, and failed to make her presence felt. DIRECTOR'S CUT was forced out by LIONESSOFBRITTANY at the start, raced close up three
wide for six furlongs, and gave way through the stretch. LIONESSOFBRITTANY broke outward, prompted the pace outside CON LIMA, bid mildly between
horses nearing the quarter-pole, then faltered.

GREATEST HONOUR was off step slowly, settled off of the pace two wide around the first turn, advanced mildly between horses down the backstretch,
then sustained a four wide rally through the far turn, swept past a trio of inner foes turning for home, and steadily drew off through the lane. TARANTINO
vied two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, but got swiftly outkicked by GREATEST HONOUR turning for home, proved no match for that
foe in upper stretch while keeping on well to prove second best. PRIME FACTOR stalked three wide and comfortably outside of the pair of leaders, inched
closer into the far turn, but was put to a drive to do so, offered little resistance to GREATEST HONOUR's sweeping move turning for home, then tired
through the lane, but held show. PAPETU lied off of the pace along the inside, gained position passing the nine sixteenths pole to achieve an inside stalking
position into the far turn, but came under coaxing to keep pace with the leaders around that bend, shifted three wide turning for home, and surpassed a
tiring foe for a minor share. JIRAFALES was off slowly, saved ground far off of the pace, but failed to factor while prevailing over other non-threatening foes.
SITTIN ON GO stumbled a stride out of the gate, trailed the field, lied far off of the pace two wide and between horses around the far turn, and never got
involved. AWESOME GERRY tracked from midpack two wide around the first turn, shifted four wide into the backstretch, but came under urging to keep
pace at the nine sixteenths pole, failed to respond, faded into the far turn, and was done early. WILLY BOI set the pace inside of the vying TARANTINO,
then inside of a trio of rivals around the far turn, but weakened turning for home, and stopped through the lane. AMOUNT lied forwardly placed along the
inside, but came under urging to keep interest into the backstretch, weakened into the far turn, and was pulled up turning for home before walking off.

Footnotes
BLAMELESS raced three wide in range to the stretch, rallied to the lead outside DUNDALK and FIG JELLY late, and just held on. TROUBLING MOON was
unhurried for six furlongs, came four or five wide off the far turn, finished strongly outside BLAMELESS and just missed. FIG JELLY chased outside
DUNDALK from the outset, challenged through the lane, and was outfinished. DUNDALK set the pace inside, responded when confronted by FIG JELLY,
and yielded in the closing stages. MONONGAHELA was outrun to the stretch, and found his best stride belatedly on the far outside. HONEY WON'T raced
close up inside to the stretch, and finished evenly. TUSK raced two wide around the turns, and lacked a final bid. HARBOUR MASTER (GB) was roused
four wide on the far turn, and had no rally. FINANCIAL SYSTEM saved ground to no avail. WILLING TO SPEED broke a step slowly, and never factored.
