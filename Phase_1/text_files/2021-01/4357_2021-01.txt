Footnotes
PROBABLY GRACE angled inwards in the opening stages to join the pace outside foes, forced the issue outside a rival racing to the turn, edged clear in
upper stretch and widened the advantage late under some right handed pressure. APRIL FOG broke outwards bumping RATTLESNAKEROSE, was righted
to gain a forward placing along the inside prompting the pace, tracked just off the first flight shifting out nearing the and continued with a steady bid to prevail
for the place honors while failing to gain even terms with the winner. ANIMAUXSELLE, off last, was settled along the rail racing into the turn, gained
momentum inside foes nearing upper stretch, swung out four wide entering the lane and continued willingly while being just outkicked for second. BABIE
MONSTER tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn but offered no rally. RATTLESNAKEROSE, caught in tight quarters at the start, was
urged between foes, then along the rail pressing the pace into the turn and gave way midstretch. MAST COVE tracked off the first flight between foes in the
opening quarter but steadily faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
INSIGHTFUL broke readily, prompted a rival's pace in the three path racing into the turn, wrested the advantage nearing upper stretch and forged clear
under steady pressure. HIGHTIME VALENTINE tracked the leaders inside a rival as part of the second flight, shifted three wide racing into upper stretch
and proved best of the others. R AVERIE LYNN angled to the inside disputing the pace, dueled for command through the turn to upper stretch and gave
way. MISS ITALY, off last, then shuffled out of close quarters, settled near the inside, angled out entering the stretch and continued with an effort to improve
position. MI CLEOPATRA AND I shifted well off the inside in the opening stages tracking just off the second flight racing into the turn but lacked a closing
response. HOPE LADY settled outside foes racing to the turn and failed to menace. BABY BEE MERRY was a brief factor tracking the leaders in second
flight but faded early.

TAPSASIONAL tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening stages, steadily advanced to challenge for command three deep nearing upper
stretch, wrested the advantage and went clear under firm encouragement. DREAMING OF GERRY settled off the second flight in the opening stages, split
foes, then shifted out four wide racing through the turn advancing to contention in upper stretch, couldn't gain terms with the winner but edged a rival for the
place honors nearing the wire. IMTAKINITTOTHEBANK tracked just off the first flight a bit off the inside under light rating racing into the turn, briefly awaited
an opening nearing upper stretch, shifted out three deep advancing through close quarters in upper stretch, angled inside the eventual winner to challenge
midstretch but proved no match. DARK TIMBER, urged to terms with a rival pressing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, dueled between foes
into upper stretch and gave way. NKETIAH was hustled up the rail pressing the pace through the backstretch, dueled for command to upper stretch and

SCENIC OVERLOOK broke readily, shifted off the rail racing to the first turn dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, disputed the pace outside a rival into
the backstretch, dispatched that foe after a half, turned back several challengers leaving the midway point of the far turn, went clear when roused left
handed racing into upper stretch, then widened the advantage to the end while being taken in hand once the issue was decided. FORBIDDEN DREAM
tracked off the second flight outside a rival under light reserve in the opening half, was prompted to gain position between foes racing through the far turn,
shifted three deep nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady response to prevail for the place honors. ZARELLA, squeezed back at the break, then
taken up out of tight quarters just after the start, angled to the inside racing to the first turn regaining some position, switched outside foes on the
backstretch, was prompted to advance three deep between foes entering the far turn, altered course avoiding close quarters to race four wide into the lane
but continued with interest to prevail for a share. MORNING COCKTAIL tracked off the first flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, came around a
tiring foe to bid inside the pacesetter midway through the far turn but lacked the needed late kick. MISS ALEX broke inwards bumping ZARELLA, then was
guided to the inside to track off the second flight while rank under restraint racing to the backstretch and continued evenly between foes while lacking a
closing response. NABRUZZI broke outwards bumping ZARELLA at the start, was collected off that foe while dropping well off the field and never
threatened thereafter. PURTIZ was urged to gain a forward placing three deep tracking just off the leaders in the opening half, was prompted to lodge a brief
bid in that path entering the far turn but soon flattened out. KITTENS MISS MOJO angled to the rail racing into the first turn while being prompted to press
the pace inside the eventual winner into the backstretch, gave way after a half, was outdistanced in the stretch but walked off the course under her own
power.

Footnotes
SETHAMEE STREET shifted inwards in the opening stages to be rated off the second flight outside a rival racing to the turn, angled out six wide in upper
stretch and produced a stout rally to wrest command leaving midstretch and kicked clear under firm encouragement. MISS DEPLORABLE tracked off the
first flight outside a rival racing to the turn, shifted four wide into upper stretch advancing in close quarters between foes to bid for command midstretch but
couldn't match the winner while prevailing for the place honors. BUCKY'S DRAMA angled to the inside racing to the turn tracking just off the first flight, came
through inside foes when presented an opening to bid for command nearest the rail in upper stretch but was outkicked. POSEIDON'S PASSION, forwardly
placed four wide, then three wide prompting rivals in the first flight racing into the turn, was fanned five wide while in close quarters entering upper stretch
and faded late. ODE TO JOY, unhurried inside foes racing to the turn, tracked off the second flight saving ground on the turn, shifted a bit off the rail in
upper stretch, then awaited an opening but was blocked racing through the stretch. ALEXANDRA KAY broke sharply, was urged inside foes disputing the
pace on a narrow advantage to upper stretch, but gave out in late stages. THE GREAT KATH, urged between foes from the outset pressing the pace into
the turn, emptied out in upper stretch. DAY BY DAY broke awkwardly, then dropped off the field while his rider regained his irons in the opening furlong,
trailed the field into the stretch and was vanned off the course after the race.

EDGEMONT ROAD hopped at the start losing some position to the leaders, switched outside the first flight tracking those rivals from just out of striking
position racing to the turn, steadily advanced three wide nearing upper stretch to challenge for command, was carried out disputing the issue past
midstretch but prevailed narrowly in time under firm handling. ZENDEN broke sharply, angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival racing into the turn,
resisted the winner's challenge while drifting out under left handed pressure racing past midstretch but couldn't that foe. FIREMAN OSCAR settled last
racing off the inside in the opening quarter, gradually drew into contention three wide racing into upper stretch, then shifted inside the leaders in the closing
stages while continuing willingly to close the gap. MY BOY LENNY broke readily, was urged inside a rival disputing the pace racing into the turn and
weakened in late stages. ARCADIA CALLS tracked the leaders from out of striking distance near the inside racing to the turn and never gained contention.

DOMAIN settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch, advanced five wide leaving the far turn and continued with interest while outkicked
by the top pair. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN, reserved along the inside to the far turn, shifted out to split foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch, angled
back to the rail to make some progress but lacked the needed final kick. BUNSTER, urged to terms prompting a rival's pace into the backstretch, pressed
the issue into the far turn to gain a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch but gave out leaving the furlong marker. TANGLED WEB was rated tracking
just off the first flight racing outside a rival to the backstretch, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch but steadily faded between foes entering the lane.
THREEOHTWOCASSIE tracked off the second flight outside foes racing three deep on the backstretch, shifted four wide nearing the lane but quickly came
up empty. BACANO settled off the second flight inside rivals in the opening half and offered no rally. SKOLE, urged to gain the lead while angling to the rail
racing to the first turn, dueled for command inside a rival to the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
DREAMING OF PARIS tracked just off the first flight three wide racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue outside a rival on the turn, kicked clear
while shifting well off the inside racing into the stretch and held SHARON'S LAW on a safe margin to the end under firm encouragement. The latter angled
inwards leaving the chute taking up a position tracking just off the first flight, switched out nearing the midway point of the turn while being prompted to
advance on the eventual winner, shifted to the four path entering the stretch and continued willingly to close the gap. CAPTUREMENOW switched well off
the inside in early stages dropping well off the second flight on the backstretch, angled to the rail entering the turn and steadily gained position inside foes
while failing to gain terms with the top pair. SUGAR BRITCHES tracked off the second flight between foes on the backstretch, shifted out three wide on the
turn while being prompted to advance but had no rally. VICE GRIP angled to the inside racing through the backstretch disputing the pace inside foes racing
into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. UNITEDTORUN, off slowly, passed only tiring rivals. PASTURE PRINCESS angled to the inside early
dropping off the second flight and proved no threat. KATIE FALOONA proved no factor. RACE THE STORM tracked off the first flight racing four wide
through the backstretch to the turn and faded. TETON THAI, urged forcing the pace outside a rival in the opening quarter, was spent early.

BEAUTIFUL TIZ angled inwards leaving the chute to gain a position just off the second flight, was steadied slightly while a bit rank entering the first turn,
shifted off the inside to track off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, advanced nearing upper stretch to bid for command three wide into the
lane and went clear under firm encouragement. EL VALOR came through some close quarters nearing the first turn to track off the second flight near the
inside racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide entering the lane and continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. TIZ HERSELF ducked out
at the start, settled last to the far turn, angled out five wide nearing midstretch and found her best stride late to prevail for a share. SPARKLING PLENTY
was urged inside a rival disputing the pace to the backstretch, dueled for command inside foes past midstretch but gave way late. BLAZING ZENNA, forced
wide avoiding traffic racing into the first turn, settled outside foes off the second flight and improved position three wide between foes in late stage. GOLD
COUNTRY angled inwards while moving to terms with a rival to force the pace, pressed the issue outside that foe to the far turn and gave way leaving
midstretch. ANGEL EMBRACE tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the far turn, was held up momentarily when lacking a path in upper stretch,
then altered course four wide racing in some traffic late while giving way. BEE DANNA tracked off the first flight along the inside, saved ground to upper
stretch but proved empty in the drive. RIO DEL ARMOUR worked her way to the inside dropping well off the leaders racing to the backstretch and lacked a
rally. SAETA, caught in tight quarters, then forced to alter course racing into the first turn, soon dropped out.
