MIDNIGHT BAYOU lacked early speed, moved up, racing four wide around the turn, made a steady gain, pulled away and finished strong. MY AMIGO
CHARLIE vied for the early lead, saved ground, took command, but couldn't match strides with the winner deep in the stretch. SECRET REDEMPTION
pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the top two, but held on for third. CUSTOM KAT raced near the back in the beginning,
saved ground around the turn, made a mild bid and was outfinished for third. ALAN'S ARGUMENT raced within contention and weakened down the stretch.
CLOSING AMERICAN raced near the back, came around the turn wide and was never a threat. ROCKINTHERED always raced near the back and showed
little. SIR ETNEY JOHN dueled for the early lead and stopped.
