Footnotes
OFFSHORE AFFAIR quickly took control, set the pace inside, met bid at the quarter pole, dueled with CLAYTON DELANEY down the stretch and gamely
prevailed. CLAYTON DELANEY stalked outside the leader, bid alongside OFFSHORE AFFAIR at the quarter pole, shifted out upper stretch to lose a bit of
ground, headed rival again inside the furlong grounds but could not get by. ONE FAST BRO tracked in range from the two path, angled out in the stretch
and nailed rival for the show. CLAIM OF PASSION stalked along the fence to the stretch, remained inside but lacked room in the final sixteenth and got
nailed for the show. CARMELITA'S MAN went two wide around the first turn, stayed in the two path through the second bend and gained ground in the final
furlong. TROPICAL TERROR went two wide into the first turn then angled to the rail around the bend, steered out into the two path entering the far turn,
angled four wide leaving that bend, showed a mild response in the late stages but needed more. SEA OF LIBERTY raced off the pace along the inside,
moved out into the two path on the second turn and failed to threaten in the drive. KAKISTOCRACY raced along the inside into the clubhouse turn then
moved out into the two path, angled three wide on the second turn and also failed to threaten. BIG CITY BANE traveled mid-pack from inside, saved ground
to the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
PHAROAH'S HEART showed early speed outside a rival then chased BYE BYE MISS PIE to the turn, went two wide around the bend and into the stretch,
drew alongside the leader in upper stretch, put a head in front at the furlong marker and drew clear under hand urging. BYE BYE MISS PIE tossed head and
came away bit slow, chased the top pair then went up to take command and clear early, carried the lead along the inside into the stretch, challenged nearing
the eighth pole and offered no resistance when losing the lead and stayed on for the place. LITTLE RACHEL off alertly then dropped back to a stalking
position, took the turn three wide, was unable to summon the needed rally but finished a clear third. MISS MO' LICIOUS showed early speed to press from
inside then chased a new leader to the turn, saved ground while dropping back around the turn and weakened. SPANISH CHANNEL threw her head and
came away slowly, tracked from off the rail, went three wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
VEGAS KITTEN angled to the fence early, stalked near the inside and saved ground into the lane, gained command in upper stretch, drew clear at the
eighth pole and held safely under mild hand urging. MAESTRO DEARTE unhurried in the beginning, raced along the rail then angled out around the far turn
and into the stretch, raced five wide at the top of the drive, rallied from outside but was not enough. SHADOW SPHINX tracked two wide then three to four
wide into the lane, bid four deep at the top of the lane and got outkicked in the final furlong. SEEKING REFUGE stalked two wide, closed in nearing the
seven-sixteenths, bid outside around the second turn, challenged between foes in the stretch and flattened out. JAMMERS JUSTICE stumbled leaving the
gate, recovered quickly to take control from inside, moved clear and showed the way to the far turn, challenged by SEEKING REFUGE around the bend,
fought back two wide into the drive, lost the lead in upper stretch and weakened late. UNTAMED DOMAIN raced three wide around the first turn, trailed four
wide into the stretch and weakened.

AWHITESPORTSCOAT stalked the pace inside, angled out around the turn, bid three deep at the eighth pole, finished gamely but could not get by the
winner. STREET IMAGE sped clear early, led in the two path into the drive, lost command inside the eighth pole and stayed on to hold the show. SHANE
ZAIN chased between foes then moved to the inside and went evenly in the final furlong. MINOSO tracked outside rivals, five wide into the stretch and could
not rally. SHORT OF EZ tracked off the inside, checked at the seven-sixteenths pole, brushed foe at the three-sixteenths and kept on to improve. FLIP THE
COIN JAN bumped with rival leaving the gate, settled off the pace, exited the bend three wide and could not rally. DEBT MONGER chased from outside,
went four wide into the drive, drifted in upper stretch and weakened. PORTANDO traveled near the back of the pack while off the inside, angled out on the
turn, came five wide into the drive and passed tired rivals. ROYAL SEEKER trailed early, went between foes on the turn, steadied nearing the quarter pole,
angled out in the stretch and could not rally. JEDI KNIGHT chased between foes then off the rail, went between rivals again into the turn, two wide into the
stretch, tipped out and had little left. MISTER MOJO tracked off the inside, raced three to two wide around the turn, brushed by rival at the three-sixteenths
pole and weakened. TRISTRAM SPEAKER stumbled leaving the gate, raced near the back of the field, saved ground into the lane, angled out and steadied
at the eighth pole and was never a factor. MR. ESKEN bumped at the start, chased between, steadied at the seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back around
the turn and tired.

ENGLAND'S ROSE off a bit slow to begin, allowed to settled off the pace, angled out around the far turn, rallied and surged past the runner-up.
DISAPPEARING ACT in range off the inside, traveled three deep at the three-eighths pole, bid four deep at the quarter pole, gained command in upper
stretch but could not offer resistance to the winner in the late stages. LOOKINTOGETEVEN went to three wide around the first turn, reserved at the back
early, angled out and bid five deep around the far turn, drifted out into the lane and got outkicked in the final furlong. WIND AND HOPE up close outside the
top pair, vied three deep around the second turn and could not match strides in the lane. LOOKIN SO LUCKY dueled for the lead outside a rival, vied
between on the far turn, lost the lead at the quarter pole and weakened. SHES'A PERFECTLADY stalked outside a rival or two wide into the stretch, moved
out three wide in the lane and never threatened. ACOUSTIC SHADOW stalked the pace from inside, lacked room behind LEMON DROP TINI around the
far turn, tipped out at the three-sixteenths pole and could not rally. LEMON DROP TINI dueled along the inside, vied with four rivals at the quarter pole, was
put in a bit tight entering the stretch and tired.

KALYPSO off alertly, went up to dueled for the lead outside a rival, put a head in front at the five-sixteenths pole, moved out a bit in upper stretch and clear
inside rival, remained strong in the final furlong under a crack of the right-handed whip and steady handling then in hand nearing the wire. FROSTERIA
tracked outside a rival, ranged up four wide around the turn and three wide into the stretch, rallied for the place. BRILLIANT CUT bumped outside rival at the
start then bumped with same foe prior to leaving the chute, dueled for the lead from inside to the stretch, could not match the winner in upper stretch and
weakened late to third. QUEENGOL shifted in and bumped rival at the start, stalked outside rival, three then two wide around the bend and lacked a
response when called upon. NASREDDINE bumped leaving the gate, pinballed soon after and steadied early, stalked the pace in the two path then angled
to the rail around the turn and weakened. EXOTIC WEST bumped repeatedly and steadied twice early, dropped back around the far turn and had little left
for the drive.

and got up in time. ALL QUALITY unhurried in the beginning, saved ground around the turn, angled out and split foes in the final sixteenth, led late and got
nailed by the winner. NU PI LAMBDA chased inside then two wide into the lane, angled out in upper stretch, rallied six wide and got up for the show.
ALTHEA GIBSON in range early and angled to the inside, saved ground around the bend, rallied along the fence and was edged for the show. GALLOVIE

pace early then gained control and cleared rivals, showed the way clear to the eighth pole and was caught in the late stages. MISS LUCY (IRE) chased
outside a rival, angled out four wide into the stretch, drifted out in the lane and finished evenly. DOLCE traveled mid-pack in the early going, angled four to
five wide into the stretch then seven wide in the lane and could not rally. A NEW PEACE steadied and bobbled early, tracked off the rail then between foes
at the seven-sixteenths, exited the bend three wide and failed to threaten. WOKE UP TO ACES showed early speed then chased the leader off the inside,
went three wide into the drive and weakened. POWERFULATTRACTION traveled near the back of the filed, raced outside a rival, came out at the top of the
