turn, steered out in the lane, rallied three deep and between foes at the sixteenth pole and edged MOTOWN MUSIC in the closing moments. MOTOWN
MUSIC bumped both sides at the start, raced two wide then angled out steadily into the four path around the first turn, chased the top trio from outside to the
far turn, remained four wide through that bend, rallied widest in the drive but got outclosed by the winner. CHARLITO pressed the pace from between rivals,
dueled around the far turn and into the stretch, fought to the sixteenth and edged CANADIAN PRIDE for the show. CANADIAN PRIDE bumped leaving the
gate, set the pace inside a pair of rivals, dueled with CHARLITO around the final turn and into the stretch, battled to the sixteenth pole, could not match the

and held gamely. OLE SILVER in range outside a rival, went two wide around the turn, moved out in upper stretch, rallied outside the top pair and missed.

the furlong grounds but could not get by. INVINCIBELLA (GB) raced along the inside then two wide into the stretch, steered out widest in the stretch and
summoned a late rally. HELLO BUBBLES saved ground around the turn, lacked room and altered out in upper stretch and kept on to the wire. SECRET
SQUARE chased three wide to the stretch, angled out in the drive and needed to find more. QUEEN STORMBORN stalked off the inside then angled to the
rail, raced a bit off the rail into the drive then came back in at the top of the lane and lacked further response. SUGAR PICKEL tracked off the rail or between
rivals on the backstretch, angled in on the turn, moved out and could not rally. CONCISE ADVICE threw head and came away slowly, went two to three
wide around the turn and never threatened. JUMPING JILL FLASH was off the pace in the early going, raced two then three wide on the turn, angled out
and weakened.

Footnotes
HALLOWED GIFT set the pace with TIGER'S SONG to the outside, cleared rival briefly in the stretch before being challenged once again and staved off the
rival to the wire. TIGER'S SONG pressed the pace from outside, lost contact briefly in the stretch before challenging the leader again in the furlong grounds,
lacked the needed late punch but was clearly second best. FLYING CHARLIE off slow to begin, went up between rivals, angled to the inside around the turn
and bested the rest. DERBY WAR lacked early speed, took the turn two wide, came out in the stretch and improved position. JUNGLE ROAR stalked the
top pair from inside, coaxed along at the three-eighths pole, came out leaving the turn and never rallied. GOLDEN VICTORY broke a bit awkwardly at the
start, raced up close between the top pair then dropped back a bit to chase three deep, got floated out five wide into the stretch by JUNGLE ROAR, angled
to the inside in the stretch and lacked further response. LANDAA chased from outside early, lost ground approaching the half-mile pole, dropped back
around the bend and was through early.

Footnotes
I'M THE HERO sped clear and opened up a comfortable advantage, maintained that lead through the turn and into the stretch and held well. BRISTOL
BAYOU reserved in the early going, advanced up the backstretch, went between rivals through the turn, tipped out at the top of the lane, rallied and whittled
the gap on the winner while gaining the place. PREDICTABLE TULLY (IRE) broke in and bumped rival at the start, chased between foes then two wide
around the turn and went evenly in the final furlong. I GIVE UP bumped at the start, traveled near the back of the field, raced along the inside then came out
into the stretch and showed a mild response to earn a minor award. KISS AND RUN tracked off the inside, went three to four wide around the turn and
never rallied. COSMIC COWGIRL angled to the inside early, chased along the rail the moved into the two path around the bend, exited the turn between
rivals and lacked the needed response. MANGOTANGO chased outside rivals up the backstretch, took the turn three wide, moved out in the stretch and
weakened. WILD ARCH bumped both sides at the start, stalked the pace from inside and weakened. BELLIZE broke alertly from the far outside then
chased three deep or outside a rival, went three wide around the turn and flattened. SPRING TO SUMMER bumped both sides leaving the gate, trailed up
the backstretch, got floated out by rival entering the lane and never threatened.

Footnotes
OIL CAN KNIGHT pressed the pace from outside, headed rival at the five-sixteenths, took over at the quarter pole, kicked clear with a furlong to go and held
well under strong handling late. OCTOPUS stalked outside the top pair, went four then three wide around the turn, bid outside the winner late but lacked the
needed late kick. SATCHEL DE RITCHES chased the pace from inside then moved into the two path around the turn, angled out at the three-sixteenths
pole and finished evenly in the late stages. LITTLEBITAMEDAL lacked early speed, angled outside, entered the turn six wide, exited five wide and improved
positioin. HORSE GREEDY went five to four wide around the turn and never threatened. BEDROCK tracked outside a rival, went three wide around the
turn, angled inside rival upper stretch and could not rally. CARTELLATE set the pace under pressure, headed by rival at the five-sixteenths, lost command
nearing the quarter pole but fought back into the stretch, could not keep pace to the eighth pole and gave way.

MUCHO UNUSUAL up close early outside the leader, drew alongside around the far turn, got forced out by BROOKE entering the stretch, took over at the
eighth pole and prevailed under right-handed urging. SEDAMAR tracked two wide then altered five wide entering the stretch, bid three deep with a furlong to
go and gained the place. BROOKE (CHI) set the pace from inside, shifted out entering the stretch, then shifted in and bumped rival past the three-sixteenths
pole, lost command near the eighth pole and got outkicked for the place. COLONIAL CREED was fractious in the gate, stalked along the inside to the
stretch, got bumped by BROOKE and checked past the three-sixteenths pole and was not persevered with after. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE
STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED BROOKE FROM THIRD AND PLACED HER LAST FOR SHIFTING IN AND CAUSING COLONIAL CREED TO CHECK
PAST THE THREE-SIXTEENTHS POLE.

prevailed over the runner-up. WESTERN SMOKE showed speed along the inside, set the pace under pressure to the outside, headed by foe around the far
turn, vied inside to the stretch, lost the lead in upper stretch, lost contact with the winner nearing the eighth pole then came back on in deep stretch and

stayed four wide to the stretch and gained the show. BODEGA steadied twice around the first turn, trailed to the far turn, angled five wide into the stretch
and got edged for the show. MASTER RECOVERY bumped leaving the gate, settled off the pace, angled out into the stretch, tipped out at the top of the
lane, asked left-handed in the drive and responded with a mild rally. BAM BAM AGAIN steadied at the three-quarter pole, tracked three to four wide into the
lane and never threatened. TEJON prompted the pace from outside, headed rival at the five-sixteenths, vied between into and upper stretch, then weakened
in the final furlong. UNION LEADER went two wide around the first turn, closed in entering the backstretch, coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths pole,

Footnotes
GOLDINI pressed from outside, headed rival at the quarter pole, led into the stretch and finished strong under a drive to the wire. EL JOY stumbled leaving
the gate, tucked inside on the first turn, remained inside then moved out into the two path on the second bend, angled out upper stretch and closed well for
second. LABOR UNION set the the pace under with company to the outside, raced on even terms at the quarter pole, relinquished control entering the
stretch, could not kick on the winner but stayed on to hold the show. ZOFFA chased between rivals then outside the top pair, went two to three wide into the
stretch and needed more in the final sixteenth. MOUNT PELLIAR stalked from inside, saved ground to the stretch, lacked room behind rivals at the eighth
pole, gained a clear path but lacked room again in the final sixteenth and could not advance. WILLY THE COBBLER went three wide early, outside a pair of
rivals on the backstretch, raced two wide while outside a foe on the far turn and improved position in the drive. SKY NAVIGATOR went three wide around
the first turn, steadied between rivals at the nine-sixteenths, angled to the rail around the far turn and could not rally. GREENER PASTURES chased two
wide early, went outside a pair of rivals on the backstretch then four wide to the far turn, angled in a path around that bend and weakened. SIR WILLIAMS
DREAM raced well off the pace, traveled along the inside then two wide leaving the turn, came out at the top of the stretch and never got involved. SIERRA
PASS off slow to begin, moved to the inside around the clubhouse turn, stayed inside to the stretch and showed little.
