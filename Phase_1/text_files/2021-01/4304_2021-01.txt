Footnotes
CHARGE THE LINE pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, took over outside the five-sixteenths, accelerated clear into upper
stretch and powered away under a brisk hand ride to prove much the best. FIRE BLASTER was last to commence, moved up on the outside near the
half-mile pole, chased four wide on the turn, drifted out inside the three-sixteenths and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. TAKEN
BACK brushed with a foe at the start, settled off the pace, was forced out then dropped back near the half-mile pole, came under urging in the four path on
the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch under a left-handed whip, drifted in outside the furlong marker and just got up for the show. PURE VALOR
brushed with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, was asked in the three path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response then just missed the show. LUKE'S CAJUN STAR broke open his stall door prior to the start but remained in the gate, settled off the pace,
dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground under urging on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to threaten. ROGER
BROWN was away alertly, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner outside the
five-sixteenths and stopped then was distanced while traveling uncomfortably in the final furlong but was walked off.

Footnotes
MATT'S HONEY was hustled from the start, moved out into the first turn, went two to three wide on that bend, was well placed down the backstretch,
chased inside on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path under a left-handed whip, pursued the leader while moving out some into the final
sixteenth, gained while moving a bit further out late and got up in a long drive to prevail. TEXAS RAIN was moving around at the start and broke very slow,
went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along in the two path on the far turn then guided out in upper stretch, moved further out at
the eighth-pole, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed well but missed while able to get the place. N. D. FREE went around the first turn in the two
path, settled just off the pace on the outside, ranged up three wide on the far turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, shook clear in upper stretch,
remained clear under a drive into the final furlong but was caught while able to hold the show. YES I'M EVIL broke a step slow, went three wide on the first
turn, settled towards the rear, was urged along while three then four wide on the far turn then driven five wide into the stretch and finished willingly but
missed the trifecta. DIAMONDCOAT went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, raced in the two path on the far turn, dropped back at
the five-sixteenths and weakened. RAGATAGTAG went to the front, set the pace on the inside, was asked on the far turn, lost the advantage coming to the
quarter-pole and gave way.

ALL FACT was rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted just behind the leader on the far turn, shifted four wide into upper stretch then was roused,
rallied to the lead inside the three-sixteenths, shook clear inside the furlong marker and drew away under strong urging. ACCORDING TO ASPEN bumped
with a rival at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled in fourth position, gained three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and earned
the place while no match for the winner. DESHA went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the two path on the far
turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, battled inside of the winner into the final furlong and proved no match then lost the place. QUINN MURPHY went
three to four wide on the turns, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MISS BROOKSIDE saved ground on the first turn, settled well back in
the field, went three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor. HAVINFUNYET broke a step slow, rounded the first turn in the
two path, lagged at the rear, moved from the two path to the four path on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and never reached contention. LADY
KAZA went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, set the clear pace while in hand, vied inside while challenged on the far turn, was asked while
being headed at the quarter-pole, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way. LITTLE CODE bumped with a rival at the start, checked sharply into the first
turn, dropped from the five path to the two path early on that bend, settled towards the rear, was urged along while inside on the far turn and failed to
respond. BARBESS checked into the first turn, dropped from the two path to the rail early on that bend, settled near the middle of the field, was urged along

rallied on the far outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late. SPECTROLITE was hustled to the lead, set the clear pace, went around the
turn in the two path, responded well when set down in upper stretch, drifted out while still in front near the sixteenth-pole and was overtaken while just able
to get the place. DRAKKAR had the rider reach down to adjust his left iron midway down the backstretch, chased the pace, went three wide on the turn,
pursued the runner-up under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished then just missed the place but earned the show. MORE ABUNDANCE
bumped with a rival early, settled towards the back under some urging, went three to four wide on the turn, came six wide into then stretch and finished with
good courage for the last spot in the superfecta. EDEN GREY'S KITTEN was hustled from the start then bumped in the hindquarters early, raced off the
pace under urging, went around the turn in the two path, shifted four wide into the stretch and gained some but failed to seriously threaten.

lacked the needed response. HOTFOOT was coaxed along on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to
rally. DOWSE'S BEACH was coaxed along near the middle of the field, moved in to save ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and also

towards the back, went three wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and finished with good energy for the
show. MAN ON THE MOON went three then two wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while three wide on the far turn, came five wide

INTO MYSTIC was away alertly then eased back off the pace, raced just off the pace under restraint, rounded the turn inside to the two path, moved out
while roused in upper stretch, rallied to take the lead into the final furlong, battled outside of the runner-up into the final sixteenth and proved best under
strong urging. ELLE Z was away alertly and set the pace, vied inside to the two path on the turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch, lost the advantage
to the winner into the final furlong, fought on determinedly with that foe into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the place. CHANGE OF
CONTROL was hustled from the start, settled on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, chased the top two while
outside in the drive and was out-kicked but was clear for the show. WINNING ENVELOPE bumped with a rival at the start, settled towards the rear, saved
ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out significantly around the three-sixteenths and improved position. PLAY ON brushed
with a rival at the start, chased the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, pursued the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong and tired.
ON PROBATION bumped with a foe at the start, was ridden along towards the rear, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved out
at the three-sixteenths and failed to rally. EYEINTHESKY brushed with an opponent at the start, settled on the outside, moved in late on the backstretch,
saved ground on the turn and failed to rally. SNOWBALL broke a step slow, settled at the rear, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into upper

Footnotes
GALLANT STAR pressed the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, took the lead into upper stretch and drew clear while still on inside lead under
strong urging. EVERLOVINGHAND moved in while settling off the pace, chased in the two path on the turn, came three wide into the stretch, moved out
under a drive around the three-sixteenths and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. FIFTY PROTECTION was away alertly from the
inside post, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage into upper stretch, dropped back into the final
furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. WAR SAVVY settled off the pace, was roused four wide on the turn and failed to rally. MR. UNIVERSE
broke a bit slow, was ridden along at the back on the outside, went five wide on the turn, drifted in nearing the furlong marker and was no factor. VOLITION
broke a step slow, settled off the pace, was taken under a vigorous hold while tossing his head into the kickback nearing the half-mile pole, went three to
four wide while let out on the turn and failed to respond. MIND ON MY MONEY broke out at the start, settled towards the rear, went around the turn in the
two path and failed to respond.
