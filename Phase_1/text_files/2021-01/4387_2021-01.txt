Footnotes
FED POLICY , right to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, responded to urging leaving the far turn and was kept to her business in the drive.
SIMMARD SHENANIGAN , three wide the first turn, stalked the pace, offered a mild three deep advanced on the far turn then flattened out. TUXEDO
LEMON bobbled at the break, was checked in tight quarters along the rail entering the far turn, remained along the rail after that and rallied. LIFE IN FLASH
, angled in early, raced along the inner rail most of the trip and was not a factor. THERE GOES MY GIRL advanced four deep entering the far turn and
weakened after six furlongs. HOLY MOSEY chased the pace two wide and gave way. RIDGEMONT HIGH , no factor, was eased late.

Footnotes
LADY CLAU cleared early on and in hand, set a rated pace, remained under confident handling while three wide into the stretch, responded when set down
nearing the furlong marker and maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire. KEEPYOURSKATESON , taken to rate, commenced a run leaving the far
turn, moved up four wide into the stretch, kept on willingly but failed to pose a serious threat. LONG DISTANCE LOVE stalked three wide, was under
pressure into the lane, shifted in and faded. SALAMINA drafted back off the early pace and was taken wide, circled four wide into the stretch but lacked a
rally. TATICA broke slowly, edged up while saving ground past the five eighths, angled out nearing the five sixteenths, chased between foes in mid stretch
but lacked a solid finish. EGG NOG flashed speed then was rated back off the winner in the opening furlong, saved some ground while pursuing then gave
way in the drive. IRISH BRANDI failed to menace. HELEN GIBSON gave some early wide chase and faltered.

THE FRONT, chased that one and weakened. EXTRA MEDIUM , steadied in tight quarters along the inner rail near the three eighths pole, remained along
the rail and passed tired foes. HOLY SAINT , along the inner rail on the turn, swung outside entering the stretch and failed to rally. TAPPAHANNOCK , four
deep on the turn, gave way and was eased the final furlong. MEO DESPERADO lacked speed, gave way on the turn and was eased. FERNWOOD DRIVE
briefly chased the pace, faltered on the turn and was eased.

Footnotes
ROOF TOP BAR nudged on early to gain a bit of a forward position early on, picked up momentum under a ride mid turn then angled four wide, straightened
away soon into the lane, closed steadily under right handed rousing, overtook the tiring leader in deep stretch and edged clear. PARDON THE PUN moved
to command leaving the chute, set a pressured pace towards the rail, spurted clear nearing the lane, opened up a big lead while under a hearty drive past
the furlong grounds but tired in the final fifty yards. TALE OF DIXIE , under a snug hold while racing in the clear nearing the five eighths, awaited some room
mid turn, worked between foes into the stretch, eased out and finished well to gain. MO AMERICAN lagged inside, angled out in upper stretch and found his
best too late. BOURBON AGOGO , off slow when having his head turned at the break, recovered and raced well back, swung six wide for the drive then
closed steadily through the final furlong. HINTING prompted the pace outside PARDON THE PUN, failed to kick on with that one entering the lane, pursued
to mid stretch then faded. THE FIRE WITHIN , bumped at the break, raced off the early pace and between runners mid turn, angled five wide into the lane
but failed to generate a significant rally. COMPASS COURSE , four to five wide chasing between runners early, dropped back nearing the lane and had his
rider lose the whip near the three sixteenths. NICKY BEAR , four to five wide between rivals early on, weakened. FAVOR MAKER , five to six wide outside
runners past the three quarter pole, tired. RICKY RICKY , between rivals giving early chase, faltered.

Footnotes
THE QUANTICO KID , in hand waiting for room leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, remained along the rail to the sixteenth pole, eased out
to the two path to go by SMART STEP, led late and drove clear. SMART STEP advanced along the rail to gain the lead turning for home, sprinted clear in
mid stretch and weakened late. FEATURE ACT stalked the pace, angled to the four path in upper stretch and flattened out. WHIRLIN CURLIN , two wide on
the turn, raced between horses in the stretch and lacked the needed rally. START WITH YES saved ground on the turn, eased off the rail for the drive and
failed to rally. RIP RAP RILEY prompted the pace three deep on the turn and gave way the final furlong. THREETHEHARDWAY raced along the inner rail
around the turn, drifted to the four path entering the stretch and was not a factor. IWISHIWASPECIAL raced in the two path on the turn, was floated to the
five path in upper stretch and was not a factor. SPIN CYCLE was not a factor. COBH set the pace, raced in the two path on the turn and gave way.
GEYSER , four deep on the turn, was not a factor. BLUE DANUBE gave way and was eased.

PARCHED GHOST settled back off the early pace, was put to a ride near the three eighths as the leaders dueled, angled six wide into the lane, closed
nicely and surged past rivals a sixteenth out, kicked clear and won under steady hand encouragement. CONGRESS HALL saved ground, was under asking
mid turn, edged up leaving the three sixteenths, shifted out to split rivals near the sixteenth marker and finished gamely to earn the place. WIN THEN GRIN
rated close up while saving ground, awaited room behind the duelers nearing the lane, altered out four wide and churned on willingly. PETES PRIDE
prompted the pace outside the leader, moved alongside around the the turn, battled head to head from the five sixteenths to past mid stretch, took a brief
lead then weakened in the final yards. SILVER SIDES tracked the leaders four wide, angled some into the lane, altered back in to avoid a drifting foe, came
back out a bit late and was giving effort at the wire. DON'TBAGGAGECHECK sped to the front then secured the inside, sparred from mid turn to mid stretch
then faded. DRIVE IN broke a bit slow, saved ground around the turn, eased out and lacked a bid. SPLASHERSTOWN stalked the leaders three wide, was
put to a solid drive past the five sixteenths, wandered out entering the lane and tired. DOCUMENTED was outrun.

Footnotes
REDEEM EDDIE gained a two wide lead leaving the turn, raced well off the rail in the stretch, drifted out under left hand urging approaching the finish and
lasted. BERNIE'S ON FIRE , bumped by SEVEN ON THE ROCKS leaving the starting gate, circled the turn three wide, advanced outside REDEEM EDDIE
near the sixteenth pole then bumped SEVEN ON THE ROCKS when carried out by REDEEM EDDIE in deep stretch. SEVEN ON THE ROCKS bore in at
the break, raced four deep turning for home, rallied outside and was bumped late. MICE AND MEN , in the six path in upper stretch, altered course to the
inside in mid stretch and rallied mildly. STONE COURAGEOUS lacked speed, raced in the two path entering the stretch, raced inside horses and passed
tired ones. ACE NINE NINE , four wide on the turn, floated to the eight path in upper stretch and failed to rally. TOM TERRIFIC raced between horses in the
stretch and was not a factor. TOMMY SHELBY lacked speed, swung to the nine path in upper stretch and failed to be a factor. WHISKEY AND YOU was
not a factor. BROOKS ROBINSON rushed up early, showed speed along the inner rail and gave way. BURFORD was not a factor. MAYBE SOMEDAY
sped to the early, hugged the inner rail setting the pace and faltered in the stretch. Following an objection by the rider of SEVEN ON THE ROCKS,
BERNIE'S ON FIRE was disqualified and placed third. An objection by the rider of SEVEN ON THE ROCKS against REDEEM EDDIE for interference in the
stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
DESBORDES cleared early and set a rated pace towards the rail, turned away a threat from ANNIKA GOLD leaving the five sixteenths, opened up after
being roused near the three sixteenths then held firm while under mild coaxing late. I'M NOT JOKING saved ground while not far back, slipped through
along the rail nearing the quarter pole, shifted out and finished up willingly to gain the place. ANNIKA GOLD , three wide early, was taken five wide for the
backstretch run, dropped in some when moving up to threaten the winner leaving the far turn, failed to keep pace into the lane, stayed willingly to mid stretch
then faded. WITTY BANTER settled off the pace while saving ground, came out in the drive and had belated action. MORTAL STORM , four wide the first
turn, chased three wide leaving the far turn and gave way. I'LL TAKE THE CAKE stalked the pace three wide, was urged along past the half mile pole and
weakened. THE CIRCLE GAME tracked two wide, dropped back leaving the far turn then was pulled up near mid stretch while bleeding from both nostrils.
