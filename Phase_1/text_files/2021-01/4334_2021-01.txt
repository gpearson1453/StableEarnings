Footnotes
LULA'S ROADRUNNER settled outside, bid strongly on the turn, pulled away in the stretch and was geared down late. REITERATE stumbled at the start,
pulled between rivals, led on the turn but tired in the stretch. THREE POTATOE FOUR chased off the pace and closed well in the final furlong missing the
place. LUCKY IMAGINATION dropped back in the two path and continued willingly. THIS ROUND'S MINE eased back inside into the far turn, swung wide
into the stretch and was no factor. MUSTN'T GRUMBLE saved ground close up then began retreating on the turn. STONE COLD vied outside to the far turn
then stopped abruptly.

ROBIN'S DESTINY set a pressured pace inside and repelled numerous challenges in a determined score. BETTER YET pressed the winner throughout,
loomed a threat again in deep stretch but hung. DESCARADO chased in the two path, made a brief bid on the final turn and flattened out. MIJA BELLA
settled off the leaders, was asked for run on the final turn then came again just missing the show award. PRETTY COOL CAT hesitated at the start, raced
far back throughout. SERIOUS HAPPINESS lagged far behind and lacked a rally. GEORGIA BONNET raced off the pace and gave way readily.
SUPERLING saved ground and stopped abruptly. The stewards posted an inquiry into the start of the race with no change made.

Footnotes
JUPI'S LIGHTNING slipped through inside before the half, dueled the remainder of the race and earned the advantage in a game effort. HOUSE ARREST
set the pace in the two path, was collared before the half then battled to the finish in a game try. BOBBYFROMTHEPALM stalked the leaders three wide,
faded briefly then came again late. GRAND OASIS settled in the two path and made a gradual gain in the stretch. BOAT OVER THE HILL saved ground,
awaited room briefly on the final turn and proved empty in the stretch. SURFER BOY GEORGE dropped back outside and was always outrun. DONNIE
BRASCO reserved between rivals for half a mile then faltered.
