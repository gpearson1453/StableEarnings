Footnotes
DANCING CRANE broke sharply, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a comfortable advantage racing into the turn, then held sway into the lane under
firm hand urging and a right handed tap to prove best. AGOG was urged to a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, continued
with a steady bid into upper stretch but couldn't gain terms with the winner while proving best of the others. INSIGHTFUL ducked inwards at the start
bumping TETE A TATE, angled inwards, then shifted out three wide after the opening furlong, continued in pursuit of the leaders in that path into the lane
but had no closing bid. TETE A TETE, off slowly, then bumped at the start, switched off the inside nearing the lane but never gained contention.
SOPHISTICURL angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders racing to the turn but faded early.

Footnotes
FAN FAN angled to the inside in the opening stages while being urged to prompt the pace, disputed the issue along the rail on the turn, shook clear racing
into upper stretch and widened the advantage under firm encouragement. GRIMHILDE, forwardly placed four wide in attendance to the pace, pressed the
issue three wide racing through the turn, couldn't match the winner entering the lane but proved best of the others. JULIE'S GRACE, off a step slowly,
angled inwards while being urged to press the pace between foes racing into the turn but gave way midstretch. RACE DAY SPEED tracked just off the first
flight racing to the turn, shifted out five wide nearing upper stretch while losing contention but produced a second effort in late stages to edge a rival for
position nearing the wire. AGELESS ARTIST ducked inwards racing past the gap losing some position, was righted to track off the first flight along the
inside, shifted out four wide entering the lane but had no rally. LUCI BREEZE reared at the start dropping well off the field and never gained contention.
VIRGINIA DOZE broke readily, shifted to the three path early disputing the pace between foes into the turn but gave way after three furlongs. FOLLOWING
THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
FOURTH DESIGN angled inwards a bit in the opening stages to track off the first flight between rivals, steadily gained terms with leaders three deep nearing
upper stretch to challenge for command, wrested the advantage and went clear under firm encouragement. NATIVE HAWK angled inwards to prompt the
pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch, dueled for command between foes into upper stretch but couldn't match the winner in late stages while
prevailing for the place honors. MALIO'S broke readily, angled to the rail dictating the pace on a narrow margin between calls, dueled for command on the
turn to upper stretch and weakened in late stages. THE GREAT LOUDINI tracked off the first flight three wide between foes in early stages and continued
evenly in that path into the stretch. FIVE STAR CREEK angled to the inside in the opening stages tracking just off the first flight, continued as part of the
second flight into the turn and faded racing into upper stretch. ROLLER, off a bit slowly, was settled last while switching off the inside racing through the
backstretch but lacked a closing response. MULLED WINE, held up avoiding close quarters while switched out four wide in the opening stages, tracked off
the first flight in that path racing to the turn and soon retreated.

Footnotes
GINO TIME broke readily, dictated the pace while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, shook clear racing into the far turn and held sway to the end
under firm right handed pressure. NIP OF BOURBON, reserved between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, swung out six wide racing into
upper stretch while being roused to advance, lugged inwards under pressure forcing ANDRETTI into the path of JUSTLY REWARDED nearing midstretch
but continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. KITTEN'S CLOWN, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch,
continued in pursuit of that rival into the lane but weakened late. JUSTLYREWARDED settled inside foes in the last flight early, shifted out racing into upper
stretch gaining position four deep between foes, ducked inwards avoiding some traffic midstretch but continued with interest inside foes to just miss for a
share. ANDRETTI settled between foes off the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled out four, then five wide racing into upper stretch, was caught
in tight quarters midstretch and had no final bid. RED HOOD angled to the inside early while pulling a bit while rank under restraint, continued to save
ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid. PHARAOH FANCY PANT tracked off the second flight outside a rival, then between foes nearing upper
stretch, was held up momentarily avoiding tight quarters midstretch but had no further response. FOGGY ALBION tracked off the second flight along the
inside to the backstretch, saved ground to the lane but offered no rally. MISH hopped while ducking out at the start, was prompted to gain contention, then
bore out six wide entering the first turn, was righted to make brief progress three deep racing to the backstretch, continued in pursuit into the far turn but
emptied out between foes in the drive. ELUSIVE ROAD, caught wide throughout, dropped out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF PHARAOH
FANCY PANT LODGED A CLAIM OF FOAL AGAINST THE RIDER OF JUSTLYREWARDED ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH BUT THAT
CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
MYSTIC LINK broke sharply, conceded the lead to stalk a rival's pace along the inside under light rating racing to the backstretch, shifted off the inside
racing into upper stretch, was prompted to advance while caught in close quarters bidding between foes just outside the pacesetter but wrested a narrow
advantage in time under firm left handed encouragement to prevail. BOLD PAYNTER tracked the leaders three deep off the first flight racing to the
backstretch, shifted four wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance and continued willingly in an extended drive to narrowly prevail for the place
honors. SNAP HOOK, in touch with the leaders three deep attending the pace in the opening half, pressed the issue between foes in that path racing into
upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair while racing in close quarters through late stages. PROFESSIONAL angled inwards racing to the first turn to
dictate the pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail to the backstretch, shifted to the inside entering the stretch while resisting several challengers but
yielded nearing the wire. LITTLE MAZZY tracked just off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, lost some position on the far turn but angled
five wide leaving midstretch to continued with a mild bid. TAPSOLUTE angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the first turn but dropped back
early.

Footnotes
PRAETORIAN was rated off the second flight racing four wide between foes through the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path entering the
turn, steadily gained on the pacesetter to wrest the advantage leaving midstretch and went clear late under firm right handed encouragement. FORWARD
MOTION sprinted clear of the field while angling over in the opening furlong, dictated the pace on a comfortable advantage racing a bit off the rail through
the turn, couldn't contain the winner's bid but held grudgingly for the place honors. PLATO tracked the pacesetter three deep as part of the second flight
racing to the turn and continued willingly between foes to just miss for second. HIGH FIVE COTTON tracked the pacesetter inside rivals as part of the
second flight, gained striking position along the rail racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. DIVINE AMBITION tracked the leaders
between foes in second flight racing into the lane but faded in late stages. LEGACY AZTECA ducked out at the start, was caught five wide tracking off the
second flight racing through the backstretch but dropped back early. HOME IT TIZ was settled last and trailed throughout.

SURVEY (IRE) angled to the rail in early stages tracking the leaders as part of the second flight under light rating to the backstretch, came around a tiring
foe on the far turn to bid inside rivals racing into upper stretch and went clear under firm handling. ITSMYLUCKYSUMMER settled well off the second flight
along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn gaining position inside foes entering the lane and prevailed for the place honors.
SWEET GIANT hopped at the start while shifting inwards bumping WILD ENOUGH, switched outside foes while pulling a bit against restraint to track off the
second flight, was prompted to advance four wide racing into the far turn, steadily gained position in that path into upper stretch but lacked the needed final
kick. WILD ENOUGH, bumped while forced inwards a bit at the start, settled well off the field to the backstretch, swung out six wide racing into upper stretch
and continued with a belated effort to improve position. MUST BE A MONSTER was urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch gaining
a narrow advantage, dueled between foes into upper stretch and gave way. STRUM AND PLUCK was rated off the second flight between foes racing to the
far turn and continued evenly into the lane. COURAGEOUS CRAFT angled inwards to track just off the leaders between foes racing to the backstretch,
advanced after a half to lodge a brief bid just outside the pacesetter on the far turn but flattened out entering the lane. O'HAIRE tracked the leaders three
deep as part of the second flight in the opening half, was prompted to lodge a bid between foes in that path nearing upper stretch but emptied out abruptly in
the drive. SOLE SEEKER settled last along the inside to the backstretch and failed to menace. LUNAG RI was urged inside a rival disputing the pace from
the outset into the backstretch and gave way racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL was urged inside a rival disputing the pace a bit off the rail racing through the backstretch, gained a narrow advantage nearing
upper stretch, then gamely held the challenge of FRANKIE Z through the lane under firm handling and right handed pressure. The latter shied inwards at the
start making contact with SIXTY ONE, was righted to track just off the first flight between foes racing to the turn, angled to the rail nearing upper stretch
steadily gaining striking distance, was urged to challenge for command inside the pacesetter contesting the issue grudgingly to the end but couldn't gain
even terms with that rival. SIXTY ONE, bumped at the start, settled last racing through the backstretch, swung out entering upper stretch to race four wide in
the lane, lugged inwards despite some correction in late stages but continued with interest to edge a rival for a share. ATWATER tracked off the second
flight a bit off the inside racing through the backstretch, shifted out four wide on the turn making some brief progress but proved empty in the drive.
HESALITTLE SHADY ducked inwards at the start, was righted to track off the first flight three wide racing to the turn, was prompted to lodge a brief bid
between foes in that path nearing upper stretch but emptied out abruptly entering the lane. GRAB THE CHANCE, off slowly, shifted outside rivals on the
backstretch to race four wide into the turn, was fanned five wide nearing upper stretch and had no closing response. DEVILISH THOUGHTS angled inwards
while being urged to force the pace outside the eventual winner racing into the turn but gave way after a half. DREAMING OF GUS made brief pursuit of the
leaders along the rail but dropped out early.

REGAL SPEAKER was rated off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, steadily gained position in that path racing into the far turn,
shifted out three wide nearing midstretch and produced a solid closing response to wrest the advantage in time under firm handling. BEE BY THE SEA was
urged to the lead outside a rival racing through the chute, angled to the rail once gaining the advantage entering the first turn, dictated the pace on a clear
margin through the backstretch, resisted a rival's challenge dueling for command through the stretch, couldn't fend off the winner's bid but prevailed for the
place honors. MY BROTHERSLEDGE angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, then
shifted out four wide in the closing stages while finding his best stride late to edge rivals for a share. BIG RED ROCKS forwardly placed stalking just off the
pacesetter racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. OBIWAN angled to the inside
tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, saved ground to the lane while briefly awaiting an opening, then shifted out to bid three deep
between foes but was outkicked. VINCENT VAN GOGO settled along the inside dropping off the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch but had no
closing bid. ARMANDO'S TEAM, held up avoiding close quarters leaving the chute, switched outside foes to race three deep into the backstretch but offered
no rally. VINTNER settled between foes in the last flight but never seriously menaced. KODIAK BROWN, urged to a forward placing three wide tracking just
off the leaders, steadily faded racing into the far turn. ZACAPA RUN broke awkwardly while hitting the gate and trailed the field throughout.
