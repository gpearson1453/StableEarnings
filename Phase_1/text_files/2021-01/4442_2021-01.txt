Footnotes
CROSS ISLAND three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command at the
three-sixteenths and went clear under a drive to prevail. EMMA AND I chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors.
DELAWARE DESTINY established the front and showed the way six then five paths off the inside before clearing rivals inside to tuck four then three wide,
shook away nearing the half mile pole and went three wide through the turn patiently handled until placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, continued
three wide at that station, came under threat and was collared at the three-sixteenths, weakened in the late stages while preserving the show honors on the
wire. ROSIES SURPRISE bobbled at the break, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and weakened. ROSEY'S PEACH chased four wide until tucked to the two path through the turn, got
coaxed along at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. BELLAMY'SPARTYGIRL bumped at the start by QUASHANA, who
broke outwards, raced forwardly placed five wide down the backstretch showing brief speed, backed away nearing the half mile pole and went four wide
through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued four wide for home and folded. BAREFOOT DANCER chased just off the inside under
coaxing from three furlongs out, spun three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. QUASHANA broke out at the start bumping
BELLAMY'SPARTYGIRL, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four to five wide through the turn, angled in to spin just off the
inside for home and proved no menace. Please note due to a winter weather safety initiative all riders carried an additional two pounds.

Footnotes
MIND OF GOLD away without apparent mishap, get set up in the three path prior to departing the backstretch, saw the rider holding something back in
pursuit of the pacesetter, was cued up swinging into the stretch, closed the gap enough so as to begin the last eighth latched on to the previously-mentioned
foe, out-dueled that one over the course of the sixteenth that followed, then drew off smartly. CHARLOTTE WEBLEY established the top in short order, got
guided over into path two, was lightly hand ridden carving out the pace on a loosely-contested advantage, settled into upper and got switched over to
stronger handling, was pounced upon by the top one coming up to the furlong marker, had the winner take charge, held on quite well afterwards to save
second. BIG AL'S GAL lost her footing springing from the gate, tipped into path two to pursue the runner up, was put to a drive for the drive home, wasn't up
to the task at hand and weakened into the show slot. EMPRESS LUCIANA strung out two to three wide on the turn, was more the latter at the top of the
lane, lacked the necessary response. MANI PEDI remained stationed in the two path after the field had been released, was between rivals travelling about
the turn, commenced the stretch slightly wider, backed away. ELITE SPEED sent over to the rail at the half mile pole, left the five-sixteenths marker being
briskly urged along, cut the corner into the lane and faltered. SYZYGY stumbled at the start, raced well out in the middle of the strip of the backstretch, spun
three wide onto the turn, strolled towards path six exiting it, failed to contend. All riders carried an additional two pounds in compliance with a
weather-related safety initiative.

Footnotes
CADEAU DE PAIX took up residence in path two after stumbling at the break, was patiently ridden keeping watch on the front runners for the initial half,
fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch to obtain the needed racing room, kicked into her best and closed the gap, wrested away the advantage
with slightly under a sixteenth remaining and drew clear. QUALITY STONES away well, established the top, cut the splits from the inside route, with CITY
TEMPER in accompaniment one path farther off the rail, shifted over into path two herself when put to a drive at the head of the stretch, saw the top one
take over in the general area of the sixteenth pole, went well enough late to save second. STUNNING MUNNINGS got set in the pocket by the top of the
turn, was on hold forced to draft behind the second place finisher during the final stages of the run around the bend, cut the corner, ventured onward stuck
in the same predicament, gained a seam with which launch a rally of her own about a sixteenth later, was given her cue, flattened out. SARATOGA
BEAUTY bumped a few strides into the contest, chased the pace from the two path on the turn, swung four wide for the drive home, mustered up a mild
response sufficient enough for the last major check. LA NEGRITA went to the outside heading for the conclusion of the backstretch, got sighted in path
three by midpoint on the turn, flashed some interest when let out a notch a sixteenth down the road, got steered out wider and wider until in the
neighborhood of path seven, inched up to the ones to catch en route for a minor slice of the pot. LEFT LEANING LUCY lost about four lengths of
momentum after getting squeezed shortly after the field had been sent off and running, got guided over to the rail at the half mile pole, tipped out two wide
entering the top of the lane, never made its presence felt. CITY TEMPER sharply maneuvered over to the rail after springing forth from the gate, was pulled
off in time before making contact with HAPPY SOPHIA, only to have ignited a bumping incident involving three equines nevertheless, tucked into the two
path, pressed the issue on the turn, continued to do so from path three during the early going of the stretch drive before giving way. HAPPY SOPHIA
bumped with another after shying away from outside pressure shortly after the start, underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn, angled six wide into the
lane, tired. HALAMA hung out four wide on the turn, wandered out into path eight in retreat down the stretch. All riders carried an additional two pounds in
compliance with a weather-related safety initiative.

MY ALLURING LADY prompted the pace from the four path, got set down continuing four wide into upper stretch, dug in to take command just inside the
eighth pole, then inched away through the late stages to prevail. BLAME IT ON MARY five then four wide just off the pace, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on through to the finish and was just up for the place honors on the wire.
HIP NUMBER ONE showed the way in hand from the two path under pressure from MY ALLURING LADY to the outside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just inside the eighth pole, fought on to the finish and was just
nosed on the wire for the place honors. IRRESISTIBLE GIRL five paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the
turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung two to three wide for home and kept on through to the finish but was outkicked. JILL'S A HOT MESS
bobbled at the break, recovered to chase six then five wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
IMPAZIBLE DONNA prompted the pace from the path two, was let out spinning onto the head of the stretch in path three, vied with vigour from between
rivals from there until the sixteenth pole before doing battling as the innermost of a trio, gamely got the job done. WAILIN JOSIE settled into path two after
making suffering some light contact right after the start, sat reserved within range during the run around the bend, was under a ride angling four wide into
the lane, became one of the middle members of a foursome vying for the top, continued to fight from between opponents the remainder of the way home,
earning a second place check for her determination. ELOQUENT SPEAKER stayed stationed in path four, got asked for more coming up to the
five-sixteenths pole, commenced the stretch one path farther off the inside, contended for the top as the outermost of a three from the top of the lane to the
vicinity of the sixteenth pole, then from juncture onward as the widest of a trio, had to settle for third after being denied. ANYDAYISHERDAY argued for the
control from a slight distance from off the rail, shifted towards path two as a couple of others from the outside joined the pace dispute at the top of the lane,
gave in to extreme outside pressure, fought until the general area of the sixteenth pole before backing away. SKY KITTEN tracked the front runners from
along the inside route, flashed interest cutting the corner into the stretch, flattened out. QUIETUDE guided onto the rail at the half mile pole, swung out four
wide entering the stretch, had no offering. BEAUTIFUL KAREN three wide on the turn, went five wide into the lane, gave out. All riders carried an additional
two pounds in compliance with a weather-related safety initiative.

Footnotes
DANCING KIKI prompted the pace from the two path taking over command near the quarter pole, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch,
edged clear under a drive to prevail. FUNNY BONES FLAG four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into
upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. CALIDAD tossed his head when breaking in at the start getting steadied and bumping UNDETECTABLE
into BELLA DOMENICA conceding about three lengths to the front, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to four
wide for home and offered up a mild kick. REPEAL AND REPLACE bumped at the start by GHOSTGHOSTGHOST who recovered outwards from a
stumble, chased three to four wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide for home and weakened. BELLA DOMENICA bumped at
the start by UNDETECTABLE due to pressure from CALIDAD, came under hustling and showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from
DANCING KIKI to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch,
then backed away and tired. GHOSTGHOSTGHOST stumbled at the start recovering outwards and bumping REPEAL AND REPLACE, chased just off the
inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and folded. UNDETECTABLE got bumped at the start by CALIDAD who broke
inwards and in turn bumped BELLA DOMENICA, chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch
and made no impact. Please note that due to a winter weather safety initiative all riders carried an additional two pounds.

Footnotes
THE GRASS IS BLUE off to a sharp start, was put to a firm hold, encountered the runner up in path three early during the run around the clubhouse bend
and tucked into the two path herself shortly afterwards, was snugly rated drafting behind TRAFFIC LANE on the backstretch, followed that rival's lead and
dove onto the inside route on the far turn, tracked the pacesetter, now however stuck in a blind switch for a good portion of the journey leading up to the
quarter pole, became unentrenched from it by easing back slightly and then tipping into the three path in the general area of the three-sixteenths marker,
kicked into stride when fed her cue, struck the front in deep stretch and edged away. COFFEE BAR took up position outside TRAFFIC LANE after the start,
rode the three path while keeping an eye on the aforementioned opponent all the way until the conclusion of the backstretch, shifted one path closer on the
second bend, went into the lane, issued her bid in earnest a few jumps later, had no sooner snatched it away when the winner came bearing down to her
outside, relinquished for good approximately a sixteenth down the road, had no difficulty salvaging second. DIAMOND ORE took the inside route, was put to
encouragement on the far turn, angled three wide onto the top of the lane, finished well enough to be along for the show. TRAFFIC LANE established the
top prior to departing the backstretch, led the way being rated along two wide until the half mile pole, moved closer to the rail departing that station,
continued onward on the lead, with the second place finisher close by to her outside, succumbed when put to the test by COFFEE BAR approaching the
three-sixteenths pole then readily backed away. WONDERWALL pursued the pace towards the two path, was put to a drive as three-quarters was being
reeled off, went a couple of paths wider into the lane and was allowed to fade away. All riders carried an additional two pounds in compliance with a
weather-related safety initiative.

Footnotes
TRUE PALACE six paths off the inside down the backstretch at the tail of the field, went four to five wide through the turn coaxed along from the
three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch, closed well outside to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command seventy yards from
home, then edged away to the finish. Z'FINALE four then three wide just off the duel, advanced on the top pair latching on when put to coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home taking over command, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and was caught seventy yards
out while clear of the rest for the place honors. LORENZEN chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid to the eighth pole, then flattened out in the late stages while along for the show honors.
WHATS IN IT FOR ME reluctant to load prior to the start, was a bit fractious in the gate, dueled three then two wide with WHICHWAYTOMALIBU to his
inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got joined outside by Z'FINALE at the five-sixteenths and dug in between foes getting headed for command
near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home and weakened. WHICHWAYTOMALIBU bobbled at the break, recovered to duel inside of the
aforementioned foe coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. RINGGOOD chased two to three
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired. SAL MY PAL chased along the inside, came under coaxing in the
two path at the seven-sixteenths, continued just off the inside for home and faltered. Please note that due to a winter weather safety initiative all riders
carried an additional two pounds.
