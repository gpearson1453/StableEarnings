LADY LEAH good break to the lead, stayed clear and gamely held the win. POUR GIRL never far back from inside, stayed game in the stretch for place.
WAR EAGLE'S LOVE chased leader throughout, stayed on well to hold the show spot. VIVA FOREVER reluctant to load, causing delay, well placed, just
missed 3rd. FLIRTY came out start, inside stretch run with no gain in the drive. TEMPESTUOUS AMY bounced around start widest in stretch, no gain. MY
DARK SECRET close up for three quarters, gave way readily. ARIAN RAE never a factor. DOUBLE OAKED quickly dropped back to rail. HEAD ON VIDEO
