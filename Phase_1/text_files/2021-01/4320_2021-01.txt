Footnotes
GOLDEN settled off the pace, gained ground through the far turn, shifted in and bumped IVY LEAGUE mid-stretch and drew clear late. IVY LEAGUE angled
in early, chased a bit off the rail, angled out on the second turn and bid three deep, led into the stretch, got bumped by GOLDEN mid-stretch and got
outkicked while proving second best. FOCACCINA tracked near the rail or two wide to the stretch and held the show. LISETTE off a bit slow to begin,
bothered by rival into the first turn then angled in around the bend, raced along the inside into the far turn then moved out into the two path and improved
position. QUICK AND DIRTY closest to the pacesetter through the early stages, bid outside on the second turn, led past the quarter pole, overtaken into the
stretch and weakened. BASIL FLAVOR bothered into the first turn then angled to the rail, traveled two wide to the stretch and could not rally. CHROME OF
OUR OWN raced along the inside, steadied at the three-eighths, remained inside then moved out a bit in the stretch and was never a factor. MALIBU
HANNAH sped to the front and crossed over to the inside, showed the way up the backstretch, challenged and relinquished the lead past the quarter pole
and gave way. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH GOLDEN DID SHIFT IN AND MAKE CONTACT WITH IVY LEAGUE IN
THE STRETCH, IT DID NOT COST IVY LEAGUE A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
HOTITUDE away quickly from outside, pressed the leader early, put a head in front past the three-eighths, dueled through the turn, cleared in upper stretch
then held off the runner-up. MISS FIA stalked along the inside, steadied at the half-mile pole, angled out on the turn, exited the bend four wide and traveled
five wide in upper stretch, closed outside the winner but lacked the needed final punch. GIDGETTA stumbled at the start, up close early between the top
pair then dropped back to stalked between rivals, took the turn two wide and finished willingly for the show honors. ADORABLY SWEET tracked outside a
rival then three deep on the backstretch, moved up alongside the top pair around the turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and flattened out. JUNGLE
JUICE (IRE) set the pace under pressure from HOTITUDE, lost the lead past the three-eighths pole, fought back along the inside to the stretch and folded.

Footnotes
HONOR AMERICA set the pace under pressure from DONNA BELLA, dueled with rival around the turn and down the stretch, drifted out in the lane and
gamely prevailed. DONNA BELLA prompted the pace from outside, dueled around the turn and into the lane, drifted out in the stretch and got denied by the
winner. LADY MYSTIFY forwardly placed along the inside, angled three wide around the turn, drifted out in the lane and finished well for a game third.
CLASS REUNION stalked off the inside, went four to five wide around the bend, drifted inward in the stretch and bested the rest. MIDNIGHT DIVA chased
off the rail then outside a rival, took the turn three to four wide, drifted to the inside in the lane and flattened. AADHANA was off the pace up the backstretch,
took the turn two wide, angled out upper stretch, drifted back inside and also flattened. MISCHIEF FREE trailed the field early, entered the turn three wide,
exited four wide and proved no menace.

Footnotes
AQUA SEAFORM SHAME chased the speed from inside, tipped outside the leader into the lane, took over in upper stretch and stayed strong under a drive
to the wire. SADIE BLUEGRASS set the pace from inside, remained unchallenged through the turn, entered the stretch a bit off the rail, was overtaken soon
after by the winner but stayed on well through the final furlong. GYPSY BLU in range three wide into the turn, angled five wide into the stretch and held the
show. LOVE AND PEACE (FR) stalked the pace along the fence, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out in the drive and got outkicked for the show. AN
EDDIE SURPRISE chased two wide around the bend, angled to the inside in the drive and needed to find more in the final sixteenth. HEATHERS GREY
stalked from outside, traveled three deep around the turn, four wide into the lane and flattened. GYPSY SPIRIT (GB) reserved in the early going, steadied
off heels at the quarter pole, angled out into the stretch and lacked a rally. GETTIN SIDEWAYS broke cleanly but lacked early quickness, saved ground off
the pace, was in a bit tight along the fence into the stretch and passed tired rivals. CROUGHAVOUKE (IRE) traveled mid-pack up the backstretch off the
rail, went three then four wide around the turn and weakened. WATCH ME BURN up close early outside the leader, between rivals on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
POSTERIZE set the pace outside a rival, cleared foe past the half-mile pole, showed the way two to three wide into the stretch, drifted out a bit and
remained clear under right-handed urging. PROMISE NOTHING settled off the pace inside a trio of rivals, saved ground to the stretch, finished willingly
along the inside and saved the place. SELF TAUGHT tracked between foes into and around the turn, entered the lane two wide, showed late effort and
missed the place between rivals. ITALIANO bumped at the start, chased four deep then four wide into the stretch, angled outside a rival in the drive and
whittle the gap late. RAGING WHISKEY bumped at the start, chased three deep and between foes, three then two wide around the turn and never made an
impact. CARTELLATE pressed from inside then chased the leader to the turn, angled outside rival around the bend and faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
NICE ICE steadied behind the leader around the first turn, went up to take control at the nine-sixteenths, cleared rival on the backstretch, inched away on
the turn, drew off in upper stretch under a drive and held safely under hand in the late stages. KITTYHAWK LASS unhurried early and tucked inside, angled
into the two path around the far turn, steered out in upper stretch and closed well. ELLIE ARROWAY stalked outside a rival, three deep at the quarter pole,
lacked the needed response in the drive but bested the rest. SCHERZO (GB) steadied into the first turn and raced three wide around that bend, chased four
wide into the far turn, angled down to the two path, summoned a mild rally and earned a minor award. TOO MUCH HEAVEN stumbled at the start, stalked
the outside a rival then two wide into the lane and weakened. COLOMBIAN GOLD raced along the inside while in range, angled two wide around the far
turn and could not rally in the drive. LAKERBALL angled in soon after the start, traveled along the inside to the stretch, came out in the lane and was never
a factor. HURLEY traveled mid-pack early while two wide, moved a bit further out on the backstretch, went three wide around the far turn and had little left.
JEWEL THIEF cleared quickly, angled to the inside, led into the backstretch, lost command at the nine-sixteenths, chased the leader from inside into and
around the far turn and tired.

QAHIRA stalked outside the top pair, chased three to four wide around the turn, took over in upper stretch, drew clear at the eighth pole and held safely
under hand urging. AMUSE reserved in the beginning, went two wide and outside a rival into the turn, angled out in upper stretch and finished well. BIDDY
DUKE saved ground along the inside to the stretch, came out at the top of the lane and rallied for the show. MO SEE CAL pressed the pace from outside,
dueled around the bend, then weakened in the final furlong. DYNASTY OF HER OWN chased four wide through the turn, drifted in a bit in the stretch and
weakened. ACTING OUT set the pace under pressure to the outside, dueled with MO SEE CAL around the turn, lost command in upper stretch and tired
inside the furlong grounds.
