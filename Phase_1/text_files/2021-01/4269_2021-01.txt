Footnotes
COWGIRL CHROME vied for the lead into the stretch, dug in determinedly three wide through the final sixteenth and got up in time. I'M DA BOSS broke in
front, set a pressured pace two wide and was caught in the final stages. WELLOILEDCAT pressed the pace along the rail, loomed boldly in upper stretch
and finished with good courage. MOTOWN HARBOR void of early speed, passed tiring rivals. RACEY WEEKEND pressed the pace into the turn then
weakened. MYSTIC MAGIC had brief speed. VERTICAL TRAIL had speed four wide into the turn, stopped and jogged to wire.

Footnotes
CLASSIC MO stalked the pace from the start, was carried out to the eight path by the leader at the top of the stretch, dug in determinedly to make the lead
near the sixteenth pole and won under brisk handling. LITTLE BLAKER never far back, rallied late five wide and got up for second. REANIMATE sprinted to
a clear lead soon after the start, drifted to the eight path at the top of the stretch, angled back in towards the rail while maintained his advantage until deep
stretch then was outfinished. LUNAR HEAT chased the pace for a half, angled inside the drifting leader at the top of the strertch, loomed boldly two wide
nearing the eighth pole then came up empty. CANT BUY COOL offered a mild bid along the inside entering the stretch and also came up empty. OFTEN
ENOUGH was no threat. FURTHERINSTRUCTION was no factor. WEST LEONARD trailed throughout.

FLINT CORN never far back, closed willingly in the five path through the stretch, made the lead late and drew off under a hand ride. BODYGUARD away
alertly, set a pressured pace until deep stretch and finished second best. NEVUS unhurried early, passed tiring rivals in the six path late. PLAYERS HERO
had good early speed between horses and =faded in the stretch. HILLBILLY RICH was no threat. CHILLINLIKAVILLIN had brief speed. COREY'S CATCH
rushed to contention along the rail soon after the start, pressed the pace into the turn, checked when in tight nearing the quarter pole and dropped out of it.
LIL BIT KROME was no factor. THE RIDER OF COREY'S CATCH LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF BODYGUARD FOR
INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN, AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

STATESBORO had speed from the start, split horses two wide through the turn and into the stretch, dropped to the rail, made the lead near the furlong
marker and finished full of run to win as much the best while in hand late. MONTAUK COVE made the lead soon after the start, set the pace until mid
stretch then was no match for the winner while second best. MAXIMIZER moved up four wide on the turn then leveled off. BOOM FIVE THOUSAND chased
the pace three wide and failed to offer the needed response. KHALFANI chased the pace along the inside and faded in the stretch. CENTRIST failed to
menace. SEND ME ON was no threat. BOATSWAIN was outrun. MANNFORD stalked the pace four then three wide into the stretch then stopped.

STORM PEAK never far back, slipped through along the inside entering the stretch, made the lead before the furlong marker, drifted to the five path and
proved best under brisk handling. MAGIC MAN'S TOUCH pressed the pace two wide and finished second best in a determined effort. NOBLE BEHAVIOR
unhurried early, found his best stride late in the seven path. DON'T MATTER stalked the pace and went evenly. REDMARK offered a mild bid along the
inside into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. WATCH YOUR STEP made the lead shortly after the start, set the pace into the stretch then weakened.
KEY TO THE NILE was outrun. GATTO ROSSO was no threat. IDOWHATIDO had speed into the turn then gave way. RESISTANCE JAK trailed.

Footnotes
FLAT DISCOUNT stalked the pace along the inside into the turn, shifted out three wide past the quarter pole, responded with a burst of speed to make the
lead late and won going away. MAGIC CREDIT dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch, gained a narrow lead before the furlong marker then was
match for the winner. NATALIA'S TEMPLE unhurried early, had a mild late rally two wide. PRINCESS AVRIL dueled for the lead along the inside into the
stretch then weakened. HOPES AND PRAYERS with the second flight in the four path, faded in the stretch. EOWYN'S PARADISE failed to menace.
FORWARD LOOK was no factor. FACEYS FIRST well placed, failed to respond. WARRIOR BABY was outrun. DREAM ON GORGEOUS was a forward
factor along the inside into the stretch then gave way. YACHT trailed.
