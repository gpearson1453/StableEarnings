Footnotes
WENTRU brushed with a foe at the start, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, drafted along the rail on the far turn, was
completely blocked behind horses from the quarter-pole to inside the three-sixteenths while the other contenders made their move, altered out while roused
outside the eighth-pole then accelerated into the final furlong and closed strongly to drive past the leading duo under strong handling. AMES MISTER saved
ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace under a tight hold, moved closer in the two path while still in hand on the far turn, was roused while
swinging five wide into the stretch, rallied quickly to make an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, drifted in at the eighth-pole, battled with HALF COCKED in
the final furlong, narrowly bested that foe for the place but was overtaken by the winner. HALF COCKED went two then three wide on the first turn, was
reserved towards the rear under restraint, tossed his head and was taken up briefly outside the half-mile pole, dropped from the two path to the rail early on
the far turn then moved closer, was guided out into upper stretch, rallied to make a bid around the three-sixteenths, dueled with the runner-up in the final
furlong and just missed the place while able to get the show. SMOKEY HARBOR was rank under restraint into the first turn, went three then two wide on
that bend, settled towards the rear, was roused three wide on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and finished willingly for the last spot in
the superfecta. ONE TIME GEM was hustled from the start, went four then three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two
path on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and weakened. CITADEL broke out at the start, went four then five wide on the first turn, was reserved off the
pace, tossed his head while keen around the seven-sixteenths, was let out in the five path on the far turn while roused, floated seven wide into the stretch
and failed to threaten. OXWOOD went to the front, set the pace on the inside, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive in upper
stretch and gave way. MR. WALSH broke a step slow, went five wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked while three wide on the
far turn, chased into the stretch and came up empty. PHRASEOLOGISM was hustled from the start, went four wide on the first turn, was hard held while
rated just off the pace, came under urging in the four path on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated. EMERALD FOREST went three
to four wide on the turns and failed to respond. RAMIRIN broke very slow, raced inside to the two path at the rear of the field and trailed.

into the stretch then came under a drive, battled outside of the runner-up to the wire and prevailed under strong urging. SAINTSATION dropped in while
going to the front, set the pace on the inside, came under increased pressure on the far turn, lost the lead into the stretch, fought on gamely inside of the
winner to the wire but missed while able to get the place. BLACK KAT TAPS was taken up into the first turn, went around that bend in the two path, was
reserved off the pace, pulled closer midway down the backstretch, stalked three wide on the far turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, was put to the
whip at the quarter-pole, pursued the top two in the stretch and was outfinished but willingly earned the show. AIMARA broke out then was corrected by the
rider, saved ground on the first turn, settled well back in the field, advanced three then two wide on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch and lacked

Footnotes
ROUX GA ROUX was hustled to the front, showed the way in the two path through the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch and held under
strong urging. CANDY SHOPPER was well placed in third position, dropped to the rail leaving the backstretch, was asked at the five-sixteenths, moved out
under a drive in upper stretch and finished willingly for the place. RARE STRAIN dropped well behind under urging, went around the turn in the three path,
angled in outside the furlong marker and finished full of run while along for the show. THUNK settled off the pace, was urged three wide on the turn, turned
into the stretch under the whip and failed to rally. FAITH'S RACEDAY settled off the pace, angled in outside the half-mile pole, was urged two then three
wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. GOODROCKINALVIN chased the pace on the outside then in the three path
on the turn and tired. IN A BIND was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and was no factor. WIN WON DOBBS was urged along on the
outside, went four wide on the turn, was carried out in upper stretch and had nothing left.
