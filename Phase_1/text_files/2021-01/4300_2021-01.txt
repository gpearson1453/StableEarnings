SAGUARO set a pressured early pace from off the rail, met the bid of FLASH OF GLORY, dueled with that rival to late stretch, raced along the rail and
prevailed for the win. FLASH OF GLORY tracked the early pace, went six wide into the turn, made a bid on the winner, dueled to the wire and just missed.
AUTISM SIBLINGS was allowed to settle early, circled eight wide through the turn, was gaining late and needed more ground. DEVILS WORKSHOP was
void of any early speed, made a seven wide middle move into the turn and flattened out. WHO'S LAUGHIN NOW chased the early pace, raced between
rivals and tired. LIGHT MY TIGER was unhurried early, ranged up into the turn along the inside and was empty in the drive.
