Footnotes
POUND FOR POUND moved in while going to the front, raced inside on the first turn, set the pace through moderate fractions with some company to his
outside, moved clear while inside to the two path on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the advantage narrowly to the runner-up while under a
drive in upper stretch, brushed with that foe around the eighth-pole, dug in gamely in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under strong urging.
UNDERPRESSURE went three then four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, moved closer midway down the backstretch, tipped out four wide into
the far turn, ranged up coming to the five-sixteenths, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, took a short lead in upper stretch, brushed with the winner near
the eighth-pole, battled outside of that foe in the final furlong and was denied while far clear for the place. MAGEEZ was last to commence, saved ground on
the first turn, settled at the rear, was roused while three then four wide on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and lacked the needed
response while well clear for the show. UNRESTRICTED was hustled from the start, went four then three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the
outside, chased in the three path under strong urging on the far turn, dropped back under the whip into the stretch and capitulated. CHANGI went around
the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was ridden along while inside on the far turn,moved closer under the
whip late on that bend, turned into the stretch under a strong drive and failed to respond.

MOLLYS FLYIN HIGH was hustled to the lead then sped clear, controlled the action while inside on the turn, extended the advantage under a strong hand
ride into the final furlong, drew off under two cracks of a left-handed whip from that point to outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand ride in
the final sixteenth while much the best. G'S MINE was hustled from the start then chased the pace, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two
path, drifted out in upper stretch, pursued the winner with good courage in the final furlong but was no match while clear for the place. WILD CHARLIE was
bumped at the start, raced in the back half of the field while ridden along, saved ground while advancing some on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive and lacked the needed response while just up for the show. OPEN TAB was bumped at the start and forced into another foe, raced towards the rear
under urging, went three then four wide on the turn and also lacked the needed response then just missed the show. CONNIE BABY was fractious in the
gate, came away in good order, was ridden along off the pace, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, bumped with a rival outside the
three-sixteenths and just missed the superfecta. MAGIC COY was ridden along towards the rear, moved from five to seven wide on the turn, bumped with
an opponent outside the three-sixteenths and also missed the superfecta. KOO BABY broke in and hit the gate then bumped with a foe, was urged along at
the rear, dropped from four to three wide early on the turn, moved to the two path under the whip coming to the quarter-pole and failed to threaten.
FROIDEUR was fractious in the gate, raced towards the front under urging, chased in the three path on the turn and retreated. STINGRAY SLAYER chased
the pace on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went five then six wide on the turn, fell further back into upper stretch then drifted in around
the three-sixteenths and faltered.

Footnotes
READY FOR CHANGE showed good speed and set the clear pace, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, responded well when shaken up in
upper stretch, drew off under a brisk hand ride into the final sixteenth then was eased up while much the best. TAPPIN INTO SUMMER was coaxed along in
third position, saved ground under stronger encouragement on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and narrowly earned the place while no match
for the winner. DYNAMITE GIFT broke very awkwardly then came out and bumped with a foe while off a bit slow, angled in towards the rear, went around
most of the turn in the two path, shifted four wide while roused outside the quarter-pole and narrowly missed the place while well clear for the show. MEDIA
MENDACITY broke a half-step slow then bumped with a rival and dropped back, settled at the rear on the outside, went four wide on the turn, shifted six
wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. IT'S MY TUNE chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn and tired. PINK POSSE dropped
back under some urging, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch then dropped in some and failed to respond. G KATE was urged along
on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
YES HE CAN was hustled to the lead and set the clear pace, dictated terms while inside to the two path on the turn, responded well when set down into
upper stretch then came under the whip, swapped back to his inside lead at the eighth-pole and maintained a clear advantage under strong urging to
prevail. ELUSIVE D'ORO dropped back on the inside then moved out midway down the backstretch, went four to five wide under urging on the turn,
advanced into second position coming to the quarter-pole, chased the winner in the drive and safely secured the place. STEADYTILLREADY bumped with a
rival just after the start then dropped back, was urged along at the rear, went around the turn in the two path, swung six wide into upper stretch and
improved position to clearly earn the show. RUNCHIEFRUN bobbled at the start then bumped with a rival, raced just off the pace, chased two then three
wide on the turn, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch and tired. DISCREET TIGER broke out and hit the gate, settled on the outside, was caught
five wide early on the turn then dropped to the rail before the three-eighths, saved ground from that point into the stretch and failed to respond. RED HOT
DEVIL tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back while three then four wide on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
OLLIEMYBOY was last into stride, angled in at the rear of the field, was rated on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch,
gained outside to make a bid into the final furlong then took the lead shortly thereafter and drew away under strong urging. MAJESTIC WEST went three
wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the far turn, took the lead into upper stretch, lost the advantage to the
winner just inside the furlong marker and proved no match while clear for the place. VICTORY BOULEVARD went three wide on the first turn, was unhurried
at the rear, came under urging while two to three wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while able to get the
show. MAROON MANIAC went to the front, set the clear pace on the inside, was asked nearing the quarter-pole, lost the advantage into upper stretch and
gave way. WHATDATPAY RAY broke in and bumped with a foe, went four then five wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, dropped back five wide
leaving the backstretch, moved to four then three wide midway through the far turn, came four wide into the stretch then drifted out a bit more and failed to
respond. TALKIN MALICE was bumped at the start, tossed his head while becoming extremely rank under restraint early, checked under vigorous restraint
into the first turn, shifted from the two path to the four path around the seven-eighths, continued keen under restraint early on the backstretch then was rated
off the pace, came under urging early on the far turn, dropped back while four then three wide on that bend, bobbled inside the three-sixteenths and faltered.
