Footnotes
MAN OF THE NIGHT rounded the first turn about the three path then stalked into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, closed to the lead
three wide approaching the head of the lane and dug in determinedly to ward off the game effort of LIL MR MATT, who stalked the pace inside then picked
up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, closed to a brief lead two deep while between horses midway on the turn, was caught a furlong out but dug
in gamely to the finish. I'MOVERTHEMOON settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and came through
the far turn still in the three path, angled four wide into the stretch and dug in to take third later yards. ISLAND CADGER moved to the inside to rate the
pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, gave up the nod at the rail midway on the far turn, dropped back entering the stretch and
flattened stride later yards. CHAMPAGNE JAM raced off the pace toward the inside, bid mildly leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn
about the four path and showed little more. LUCKY PENGUIN rated close off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but
faded at the rail rounding the far turn. CASTLE ONE raced in the three and four paths the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch.

OUR DIAMOND GIRL set a pressured pace and contested the edge at the rail on the turn, then dug in under steady stretch encouragement to inch further
ahead later yards. THISLILLIMEOFMINE pressured the pace and contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, then dueled gamely to
mid-stretch before yielding; grudgingly. WINDSOR'S CHAMPION gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the three path, was eased
to the five path leaving the turn and finished evenly while gaining slowly on the runner-up. LADY LICIOUS chased outside and raced in the five path of the
turn then passed a rival down the lane. LIL MISS FIBER gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn and weakened. AUDREY LUCILLE gave chase
through the backstretch but dropped back past the five sixteenths pole and faded at the rail on the turn.

of the lane, dueled clear in the upper stretch and held on well. MERRY MERRY MOJO settled off the pace about the three path, bid nearing the three
eighths pole and raced in the five path of the far turn, then finished evenly to take second mid-stretch. DESTINY'S CHARGE settled off the pace inside, bid
approaching the three eighths pole and dueled to a slim lead two deep past the quarter pole, but was caught nearing the head of the lane and weakened.
VIPER saved ground racing well back, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and showed little more. SEIZE THE DAY
drew off to a well restrained, long early lead, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail approaching the quarter pole,

but was caught the final strides. COLETTE'S SPIRIT chased the pace and raced near the rail on the turn, dueled a close factor through the upper stretch
and finished evenly. DOMS LADY chased the pace, raced in the three and four paths on the turn and finished evenly. FRIENDLY FAIRBANKS chased

HE'S A GOLD DIGGER raced well reserved in the three path the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn still about the three
path, dueled close through the upper stretch, took over at the sixteenth pole and raced clear under the wire. MELDON took the lead into the first turn and
angled to the rail to rate the pace, was pressured toward the three eighths pole, dug in from the head of the lane but was caught mid-stretch and reluctantly
ceded later yards. WHAT A STORY raced four wide the first turn and settled close from the seven eighths pole, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths,
rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened inside the eighth pole. SLEW THE TURN rated close about the three path the opening turn, picked up the
chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole then weakened at the rail rounding the far turn. TAMAQUA rounded the opening two turns five wide and raced
close into the backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then faded in the four path of the far turn. BRILLIANT IDEAS settled close
to the early pace inside then faded leaving the seven sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
PROTA rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled to
extend that margin through the lane. BYEBYE BYEBYE stalked off the rail then picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close in the
three path rounding the far turn but was no match through the lane. STROLLANOTHERTIME stalked the earlier pace about the three path then picked up
the chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the three path then flattened stride after acquiring third later yards. AUTS REVOLUTION rated close
inside, bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then flattened stride. MR. MAURICE saved ground while racing well back,
angled to the five path on the far turn and passed rivals outside. CASTLEFINN showed little response through the backstretch. CREATIVE MINESHAFT
dropped well off the pace.
