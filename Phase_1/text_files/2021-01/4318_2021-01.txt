TEAM EFFORT hugged the inner rail setting the pace, was pressed on the far turn then kicked in approaching the eighth pole and drew out. GREEK
PRINCE , eased out entering the backstretch, circled the far turn three deep and had a slight rally. MY MAN POTS N PANS , two wide most of the race,
chased the winner and weakened late. RUNNER RUNNER INDY , three wide the first turn, was well positioned in the two path between horses the far turn
and lacked the necessary late effort. AMEN CORNER hugged the inner rail throughout and weakened in the drive. OUTSIDE THE BOX , outrun, circld the
far turn three wide.

Footnotes
DA CHROME tracked the duel inside, swung out soon into the lane, rallied under pressure, took over past the eighth pole, briefly went clear then dug in
under a drive to prevail. TIPYOURHATTOTHAT broke a step slow, bid along the rail early on, dueled into the lane, shook clear near the three sixteenths,
dug in when collared and kept on gamely. SIR LENNY , five wide early, drop in three wide around the turn, angled five wide for the drive and closed steadily.
CAROLINA CHROME dwelt at the break, edge up some early, drop back nearing the turn then came back some late. COUNT THE SHELLS , three deep,
vied between into the turn, dueled outside a rival into the lane and weakened. LUCIAN , four deep, vied into the turn, chased past the three eighths and
weakened. ARTILLERY vied two wide between early on then tired mid turn.

Footnotes
INSTIGATED sprinted to a clear lead leaving the chute, set the pace near the rail and eagerly drew off in the drive while kept to his business. THE
QUANTICO KID raced in the two path between horses on the turn, eased outside in mid stretch and rallied mildly. START WITH YES raced in the two path
around the turn, chased the winner and faded. MYSTIC TIMES , four deep around the turn, failed to rally. RUMSON RALLY , far back down the backstretch,
hugged the inner rail through the stretch and passed tired horses. MARYLANDER , three wide on the turn while chasing the pace, weakened entering the
stretch. IRISHTOWN saved ground around the turn and failed to be a factor. SEBRAY was not a factor.

Footnotes
BE GOOD stalked the pace, circled the turn three deep, challenged for the lead outside ASHARA in mid stretch then edged clear. ASHARA set the pace
near the inner rail, was challenged in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. DISCREET DOMINIQUE chased the early pace, dropped back a bit on the turn
while hugging the inner rail, remained along the rail in the stretch and passed tired horses. GOLDEN LASSIE , bumped by HOT TO PARTY leaving the
starting gate, prompted the pace outside the winner around the turn and gave way in the drive. RONA , squeezed back leaving the starting gate, circled the
turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch and passed tired foes. CINNAMON bobbled leaving the starting gate, raced three wide on the turn and was not
a factor. SUNDOG raced along the inner rail around the turn while outrun. HOT TO PARTY bore in and bumped GOLDEN LASSIE after stumbling at the
break and dropped back on the turn.

Footnotes
SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR stalked the pace racing near the rail, angled to the three path leaving the turn, swept to command in upper stretch, was kept under
pressure and drew away. BOZZINI prompted the pace two wide into the turn, gained the lead on the bend, opened a clear lead near the quarter pole,
finished willingly but was no match for the winner. GOTHAM NEWS lacked speed, raced two wide on the turn, eased out, was fanned to the six path in
upper stretch, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. SECURITY BREACH , behind horses around the turn, was taken to the five path turning for
home and lacked the needed rally. MONKEY'S MEDAL saved ground on the turn, swung outside in mid stretch and passed faders. IT'S FATE stalked the
pace, raced inside horses on the turn and weakened. THE FORTY FACTOR showed speed along the inner rail and weakened through the stretch.
UHWARRIE SKY , three wide on the turn, chased the pace and gave way.

Footnotes
TIZ AUCTION TIME bore in on EJE GAMA leaving the starting gate, showed speed in the two path, opened a clear lead leaving the turn, was challenged in
mid stretch and determinedly prevailed. MR. MIMS , pinched back leaving the starting gate, rushed up between horses down the backstretch, chased the
pace three wide around the turn, bid for the lead in mid stretch and hung. BOSS LIFE , never far back, raced four wide leaving the turn and rallied outside
horses. TALE OF DIXIE , in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, raced inside horses on the turn and in the stretch and had a mild gain. BOSTON BILLY
worked between horses on the turn and in the stretch and lacked the necessary late response. DRINK MORE BOURBON hugged the inner rail, chased the
pace and weakened. EJE GAMA , forced in by the winner leaving the starting gate, circled the turn, angled to the seven path in upper stretch and was not a
factor. ROOF TOP BAR broke slowly and awkwardly then passed tired rivals in the drive. PAPA LEW dwelt at the break, was taken up in tight quarters
leaving the turn, and failed to be a factor. SWEET ASTA , four wide on the turn, was not a factor. PADAWHIRK showed speed along the inner rail and gave
way. NOT TELLING dropped back on the turn.

and failed to be a factor. GREASEDLIGHTNING , between horses on the turn, floated to the five path in upper stretch and weakened. STARTING TOUR
