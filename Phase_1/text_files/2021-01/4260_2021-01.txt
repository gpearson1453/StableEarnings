Footnotes
THUNDERTURTLE saved ground on the turn in a striking position, eased out approaching the stretch, gained command in upper stretch then drew off while
kept to her business. LADY MACHO hugged the inner rail entering the turn, was two wide leaving the bend, angled out near the quarter pole, drifted wide
inside the three sixteenths pole and gained the place. IN CLASS set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead in upper stretch then gradually weakened.
PRINCESS GEORGIA lacked speed, circled the turn five wide and passed tired foes. ARBUTUS , a forward factor down the backstretch, raced in the four
path between horses on the turn and retreated through the stretch. STRELLA'S WAR saved ground on the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and
gave way. SOUL PLANET , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, faltered approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
CINCONOLA drafted well back off the early pace, saved ground as the leaders battled up front, swung five wide into the lane, leveled off when put to firmer
asking, drifted in advancing past mid stretch, corrected and sustained under hand urging and forged ahead late. GARY DOING BIZ vied three deep early,
took command and dropped in leaving the far turn, dueled to the inside of MY WAY OR ELSE from mid turn past mid stretch, edged away some past the
sixteenth pole, kept on gamely but just could not fend off the winner. MY WAY OR ELSE , up close while four wide early, bid three wide outside GARY
DOING BIZ near the three eighths, sparred and gained a slim lead inside the three sixteenths, gave the lead back a furlong out then lacked the needed
finish. ONE SMART COOKIE had speed between foes, chased between runners mid turn and faded. INFINITE REWARD rated off the pace, made a mild
run four deep leaving the three eighths, failed to kick on entering the lane and weakened. COOL ENOUGH stalked inside, eased out to chase between
rivals mid turn and tired. DOUBLE FIREBALL broke a step slow, rushed up between runners to get a slim lead, ceded into the turn, chased and faltered.

Footnotes
XMASINTHECITY , two wide on the turn, drifted to the four path entering the stretch, gradually closed outside foes and was up near the finish. WHATS THE
CHANCES broke to the left while rank, prompted the pace two wide around the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, lugged inside the three sixteenths
pole and weakened late. LITTLE BAY lacked speed, was taken to the four path in upper stretch and offered a slight rally. OFF THE RECORD , lightly
bumped by WHATS THE CHANCES leaving the starting gate, sprinted to the early lead, hugged the rail, began to weaken in upper stretch and was briefly
steadied behind WHATS THE CHANCES inside the three sixteenths pole. EXCHANGE FEVER lacked speed, hugged the inner rail through the stretch and
failed to menace. TWINSTINCT , a forward factor along the inner rail to the stretch, drifted wide in upper stretch and gave way. KISSEDTHEGIRLS , never a
factor, raced in the two path on the turn and his rider dropped her whip inside the three sixteenths pole. An objection by the rider of OFF THE RECORD
against WHATS THE CHANCES for alleged interference in upper stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
MY MY GIRL bore in at the start, recovered and accelerated to the early lead, hugged the rail setting a pressured pace, drew away under urging the final
furlong and drifted out late. CHARGINA prompted the pace outside the winner, faded the final furlong and was best of the rest. KEEPYOURSKATESON ,
well placed on the turn, was three deep entering the stretch and weakened. CURIOSITY KILLS raced in the two path on the turn, remained close to the rail
in the stretch and lacked a rally. SALLY'S MUSTANG , three wide leaving the turn, was outrun. EPHEMERAL , a forward factor along the inner rail to mid
turn, gave way and was eased.

Footnotes
THE CIRCLE GAME assumed the early lead, set the pace along the rail and dug in tenaciously the final furlong. TAKE ME HOME , unhurried down the
backstretch, circled the turn four wide, had aim on the lead in mid stretch and hung. ANNIKA GOLD , three wide on the turn, chased the pace to mid stretch
then weakened. ITS A JOURNEY saved ground on the turn and failed to rally. MORTAL STORM , between horses on the turn, drifted to the six path in
upper stretch and came up empty. SWEET HOME DIXIE circled the turn three wide, floated to the seven path in upper stretch and was not a factor.
YESTERDAYSPLAN raced in the two path between horses on the turn and was never a factor. SWEET MAGGIE MAE was outrun. WILDCAT CARTRIDGE
hugged the inner rail on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
MCELMORE AVENUE between horses into the turn, was shuffled back mid way on the turn, swung to the six path turning for home, closed outside horses,
led late and drove clear. PRINCE JAMES disputed the pace while three deep, sprinted clear entering the stretch and continued gamely. STAR SIGN stalked
the pace racing inside horses, swung to the four path leaving the turn, gained a short lead near the eighth pole then hung. BENANDJOE worked between
horses in the drive, drifted in near the eighth pole and failed to be a menace. FLAT OUT FLYING , rank in close quarters at the break, worked between
horses in the stretch and altered course behind BENANDJOE near the eighth pole. SEA GHOST , no factor, raced outside horses in the stretch and passed
tired ones. SOCIETY'S TIGER , angled to the inner rail while full of run leaving the backstretch, checked in tight quarters near the half mile, again near the
three and a half furlongs pole, swung to the five path turning for home and failed to sustain his bid. SALTIN' THE RIM was not a factor. SASSY KING was
no factor. AL BROWN , a forward in the two path between horses, battled to the stretch then surrendered. TOM HAGEN hugged the rail, disputed the pace
to the stretch then gave way. ADMIRE stalked the pace well off the rail and faltered.

Footnotes
GOLAZO saved ground around the turn, was two wide leaving the turn, raced along the inner rail through the stretch and gained command near the
sixteenth pole. COMMISSIONER BIGGS stalked the pace two wide into the turn, swung to the five path at the head of the lane and rallied between foes.
FUGITIVE , wide on the turn, was fanned to the eight path in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. PAPA TONY stalked the pace, advanced three deep
leaving the turn, gained a short lead in mid stretch and flattened out. MORE TWIRL lacked speed, raced well off the rail and showed a mild late gain. RIVER
CROSROAD RVF , two wide down the backstretch, disputed the pace throughout, remained off the rail and weakened late. MEGA MILLIONS , four wide
leaving the turn, gave way. SEVEN PLUS SEVEN , no factor, floated to the seven path in upper stretch. I'D LIKE TO KNOW hopped slightly at the break,
rushed up along the inner rail down the backstretch, weakened leaving the turn and was eased late.
