Footnotes
SUN SQUALL, in touch with the pacesetter three wide between foes racing to the turn, advanced to press the issue in that path nearing upper stretch, took
over entering the lane, went clear midstretch and held a rival on a safe margin to the end under firm encouragement. LITIGANT, forwardly placed four wide
attending the pace in early stages, continued with a steady bid in that path to close the gap in late stages but was always only second best. BOOYAKASHA,
urged inside foes prompting the pace into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and weakened in late stages. CHAMPIONSHIP ALLEY tracked well off the
first flight outside foes to the turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and continued evenly. WEST SIDE WARRIOR, urged between foes dictating the pace on
a narrow advantage racing into the turn, gave out abruptly entering upper stretch. TIZ LUNA settled well off the leaders while shifting off the inside and
proved no factor thereafter. MONEY HOUSE dwelt at the start to lose contact with the field and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
R KISS EM GOODBYE was urged to prompt the pacesetter along the inside in the opening furlong, was eased off that rival nearing the turn to track off the
first flight, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to wrest a clear advantage in time under pressure. MERMAID
KISSES settled between foes in the last flight early, angled to the rail nearing upper stretch and continued willingly inside foes to prevail for the place honors
while failing to match the winner. PLAY THE MAX, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter, was urged to bid nearing upper stretch but lacked the
needed final kick. TREASURED INFO tracked off the first flight three wide between foes racing to the turn and continued evenly in late stages. FLAMING
INDY, urged to gain the lead racing a bit off the rail through the backstretch, held sway on a clear margin to midstretch and gave out. PINS AND NEEDLES
settled along the rail racing into the bend and failed to menace. MARDI GRAS GIRL broke in the air, was righted to track the leaders five wide into the turn
and steadily faded in the drive.

Footnotes
DYNAMORE, reserved while guided to the inside racing through the chute, shifted outside foes nearing the far turn commencing his advance, steadily drew
into range outside a rival racing into upper stretch, shifted out three deep leaving the furlong marker and prevailed narrowly in time under firm
encouragement. DELFT BLUE, forwardly placed between foes racing through the chute, moved to prompt the pacesetter racing into the backstretch, took
over from that foe while a half mile to go, dueled for command inside rivals a bit off the rail into upper stretch grudgingly resisting several challengers but
couldn't quite contain the winner. THE WILD FLYER, held up outside foes racing through the chute while conceding some position to a loose rival,
continued under reserve outside foes to the backstretch, was prompted to terms with the pacesetter three deep racing into the far turn, pressed the issue
outside a rival to upper stretch but yielded in late stages. NOTHIN REALLY angled inwards early to track off the first flight, split for just off the inside to lodge
a bid along the rail entering the far turn but had no closing bid while continuing with some interest inside foes into the lane. RAL COBRA CREEK moved to
the fore racing through the chute while nearest the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside into the backstretch but was through after a
half. SMILES OF JOY, held up off the leaders avoiding a loose rival racing through the chute, tracked off the first flight outside a rival to the backstretch and
steadily faded after a half. BIG POLO hit the gate at the start dislodging his rider, but walked off the course under his own power after being collected by the
outrider. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
WILL TAKE ROSES was prompted to a forward placing three deep between foes racing to the first turn, conceded some position to the pacesetter entering
the backstretch, advanced in tandem with several rivals entering the far turn to bid three deep between foes, continued to dispute the issue outside a rival to
upper stretch, dispatched that foe midstretch, then grudgingly met the challenge of D FLAT WHITE and edged away from that foe in the closing stages to
narrowly prevail under left handed pressure in a game effort. The latter tracked off the second flight along the inside under light rating to the backstretch,
steadily gained position along the inside on the far turn, split foes just off the inside, then altered three deep leaving the furlong marker to loom outside the
winner but couldn't match that rival's final kick. DANCIN AT THE RITZ, caught five wide between foes while prompted to a contending position racing into
the first turn, steadily gained terms with the leaders four wide racing into the far turn, couldn't match the winner nearing the lane but continued evenly four
wide through the stretch. BELLA SERENA tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside racing to the first turn, switched out on the backstretch to press
the issue between foes, then inside the eventual winner into the far turn but gave out leaving midstretch. DOUBLE DOT, caught six wide between foes
racing to the first turn, dropped off the second flight entering the backstretch, raced four wide into the far turn and continued with an effort to improve
position. MY OWN PASSION angled in early to track off the second flight into the backstretch but offered no rally. VAN KHOZAN, caught seven wide racing
to the first turn, shifted inwards nearing the backstretch to race three deep between foes, made some progress racing into the far turn but faded in the drive.
RIO DEL ARMOUR settled last along the inside early and failed to menace. PRETTY PRISCILLA made brief pursuit of the leader four wide between foes
into the first turn but dropped out early. LADY CHITU, urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, set the pace for a half and gave
way.

Footnotes
SECLUDE bobbled just after the start, was collected, then settled off the second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, continued under patient
handling racing to the far turn, swung out five wide in upper stretch and rallied past ST. JOE LOUIS (GB) in time under firm left handed encouragement to
prevail in time. The latter tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the first turn, worked his way to the inside entering the backstretch, commenced a
steady advance racing into the far turn, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch to challenge for command, gained a brief advantage midstretch but
couldn't contain the winner. OL GREY GHOST, urged inside rivals disputing the pace into the first turn, dueled for command on the far turn into upper
stretch while shifting a bit off the rail, then yielded to the top pair late. MOONSHINE STEVE was urged forcing the pace outside a rival to the backstretch to
gain a narrow advantage, dueled between rivals into upper stretch and gave out leaving the furlong marker. JARREAU was rated tracking off the first flight
from out of striking distance near the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, was roused along the rail entering the lane but had no
closing bid. MUTAKAAMIL tracked the leaders three deep as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled inwards nearing the far turn and
steadily faded. SOLDIERS SON, forwardly placed three wide stalking just off the first flight, moved to close the gap racing into the far turn but drifted four
wide and gave way into the lane. ELEVEN STRAIT, restless in the gate before the start, trailed throughout.

GOLDEN PLUME came through close quarters at the break to gain a position along the inside tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight from well
out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, steadily gathered momentum while shifting out on the far turn to advance on the pacesetter under her own
courage racing in the three path entering the lane, quickly took charge while getting a light right handed tap and widened the advantage while being taken in
hand approaching the wire. LISHEEN was held up avoiding some traffic just after the break to track off the second flight to the backstretch, swung out four
wide nearing the lane while being roused to pursue the winner but couldn't threaten that foe while proving clearly best of the others. PERSEVERANCIA
ducked inwards at the start into the path of the eventual winner, was collected to track off the second flight to the backstretch, angled to the rail nearing the
far turn, saved ground to upper stretch advancing in tandem with several rivals but lacked the needed final kick. MISSION UP tracked the pacesetter three
wide as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, lost some position racing into the far turn but shifted in nearing upper stretch and continued
evenly into the lane to regain some position late. MONEY AND HONEY sprinted clear of the field racing into the backstretch opening a commanding
advantage, held sway to upper stretch and gave out abruptly once headed by the winner. GILDED ASSET led the second flight from out of striking distance
racing a bit off the inside to the far turn and emptied out nearing the lane. NANCYS CONNECTION, held up avoiding tight quarters start, continued a bit
erratically under restraint racing to the first turn and never seriously menaced.

Footnotes
MOZANO tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three wide racing through the far turn, was fanned
four wide entering upper stretch, angled inside DOHKO nearing midstretch to challenge for command between foes, shifted to the rail in the closing stages
but narrowly prevailed in time under firm left handed pressure. DOHKO angled to the inside racing to the first turn tracking off the second flight in the
opening half, switched out steadily gaining position three wide on the far turn, moved to challenge for command in that path racing into upper stretch, drifted
out entering the lane while gaining a narrow advantage, resisted the winner grudgingly to the end but came up second best. OLLYSILVEREXPRESS settled
between rivals racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch but continued with interest to edge a rival for a share. BROADWAY
PETE, urged to the lead along the inside racing to the backstretch, widened the advantage nearing the far turn, held sway into upper stretch and gave out
late. GOT FASHION, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, gave way between foes racing through the far turn. IRISH MAIL
settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and passed only tiring rivals. SECRET MAGICIAN settled along the inside in early stages and failed to
menace. DONEGAL ACES, urged to a forward placing tracking just off the first flight racing to the backstretch, steadily faded after a half. BOX CANDY
broke in the air while getting away tardily from the gate and never gained contention. HAPPY DANZA was urged to a forward placing racing outside a rival in
the second flight racing to the first turn but emptied out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START
OF THE RACE BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
BUC'S INVESTMINT angled to the rail racing through the chute to track the leaders inside foes as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch,
continued along the inside into the second bend, shifted out nearing upper stretch steadily gaining momentum to bid for command three deep between foes
and wrested a clear advantage in the closing stages under firm encouragement. VIOLATOR stalked just off the first flight under light rating in the opening
half, was prompted to challenge three deep racing through the far turn to gain the advantage nearing upper stretch, couldn't match the winner in the drive
but held grudgingly for second to late stages. MR. WHO tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance in tandem with the top pair while shifting out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued willingly in that path to close the gap. MR. SARCASTIC
tracked off the second flight outside rivals to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while caught four wide racing into the far turn, shifted inwards
nearing the stretch and continued to make a mild gain between foes to late stages while just missing for a placing. FEISTY KITTEN settled between foes in
the last flight racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and continued to improve position. SOPE, in touch attending a rival's
pace racing to the backstretch, was urged to press the issue between foes racing into the far turn, dueled inside foes past midstretch but weakened in late
stages. JEGOS FIRE hopped at the start while breaking slowly, settled outside foes in the last flight, was prompted to advance while shifting out four wide
nearing upper stretch but had no closing bid. HUSBAND IN LAW tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch and steadily faded
after a half. IMPERIAL GUARD, urged to the lead along the rail racing to the first turn, dueled for command inside foes to the second bend and gave way.
ZAMAN settled along the inside racing to the first turn and dropped out early.

Footnotes
SUGAR BRITCHES broke sharply, tracked just off the pacesetter four wide as part of the second flight in early stages, shifted inwards racing into the turn to
press the issue, continued in a protracted skirmish three deep between foes racing past midstretch but narrowly prevailed in time under firm left handed
encouragement. TENERIFE MOON, off last, tracked off the second flight racing five wide to the turn, steadily advanced outside foes while being fanned four
wide into upper stretch and continued willingly to the end while just failing to gain even terms with the winner. SHARON'S LAW tracked off the second flight
racing four wide between foes to the turn, continued to advance between rivals nearing upper stretch, angled inside the pacesetter midstretch to challenge
for command nearest the rail late but was just outkicked by the top pair. CHATTIN WITH JENNY sped to the lead racing past the chute gap while angling
over in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage a bit off the rail racing into the turn, resisted when challenged racing past midstretch
but gave out late. CAPTUREMENOW, settled in the last flight inside a rival, saved ground to upper stretch and improved position inside foes late. NEW
YORK COMMANDER, bumped at the start, tracked off the second flight while shifting off the inside racing into the lane but offered no rally. GRANDMARY
broke in bumping a rival, was righted to track the pacesetter inside rivals in second flight and steadily faded nearing the lane. TURBOTIGER tracked the
pacesetter between foes in the second flight racing through the backstretch, had his rider appear to give the rider of SHARON'S LAW some encouragement
when passed by that rival racing into the bend and steadily faded into upper stretch. STAGE REVIEW dropped out early.
