Footnotes
SURFER BOY GEORGE lacked speed, advanced in the two path and was up in the final sixteenth under steady handling. SINCERE MAN settled inside the
pacesetters, slipped to the lead near the top pf the stretch, bid clear but was nailed in the late stages. YONDERING vied between rivals briefly, chased three
wide and continued well. HEART OF A DREAMER hustled to the front inside, was collared into the far turn and weakened. KNOKKE BY THE SEA trailed
early inside and closed the gap without menacing. BOSTON LIGHT prompted the pace outside, was asked for run on the final turn but proved empty.
REDNECK COWBOY dropped back outside and was never in contention.

PEGASUS RED broke sluggishly, advanced inside and flattened out. INCENSED split rivals into the far turn to challenge for the lead then came up empty in
the stretch. THREATLOVESMIDNITE set the pace well off the inside then began fading on the turn. IMMUNITY raced close up wide down the backstretch

ALWAYS TALKING took control at once inside, widened in the stretch and remained safe under moderate pressure. LOVE ON FIRE pursued the winner
outside and continued gamely to the finish. STABILIZE chased very wide throughout and rallied mildly while no threat. BUCKS SOME lacked speed then
showed some late energy while no factor. ENIGMATICA broke slowest, advanced on the turn then tired. ATLANTIC AVENUE chased off the pace between
rivals and weakened. BEACH TAG urged close up in the two path and began tiring on the turn. LOOKINGFORANEWSPOT raced close up four wide down
the backstretch and stopped. GOSSIP ISLE moved closer on the turn, lost her action near the quarter pole and was eased. The stewards conducted an
inquiry into the easing of GOSSIP ISLE.

Footnotes
TOWN JAK raced four wide early, stalked three wide, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled, battled it out with CAPE MAY STYLE in the final furlong and
wore down that rival to prevail. CAPE MAY STYLE stalked between rivals, made a rail bid entering the far turn, rallied to a short lead, dug in gamely inside
in the stretch run and yielded grudgingly. GRAND OASIS raced off the pace inside, moved up on the far turn, came two wide into the lane, angled out and
rallied outside. DANCE FOR ORO raced off the pace inside, then between rivals and rallied mildly inside in the stretch. EARTHQUAKE was bumped at the
start, raced off the pace, went five wide past the quarter pole and finished evenly in the lane. KING'S GOLD raced two wide off the pace, moved up four
wide at the quarter pole, steadied briefly and failed to threaten. LOUIE'S WISH set the pace on the inside, vied inside on the backside, dueled between
