Footnotes
GRAN WILDROCKY took the lead leaving the chute and set a pressured pace, rounded the turn near the rail then dug in under steady stretch
encouragement to hold on well. WEAVE IT QUIXOTE gave chase through the backstretch and raced off the rail through the turn, then dug in down the lane
to hold on for second. KUKULKAN chased the pace, raced in the three path of the turn and finished evenly while gaining on the runner-up. NATIVE
COURAGE chased the leaders, rounded the turn about the three path and ran evenly through the lane. SHORTLISTER rounded the turn in the five and six
paths and showed little further. COWTOWN TAPIT hesitated at the break and raced well back early on, rounded the turn about the three path, eased
outward in the upper stretch and passed CHASING ANNA in deep stretch, while the latter chased the pace through the backstretch then faded about the
five path of the turn. Per Stewards ruling #5, Gran Wildrocky has been disqualified from earnings.

Footnotes
SO RED THE ROSE saved ground off the early pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and steadily improved about the four path of the far turn, dug in for
the lead mid-stretch and drew away later yards. OLD LINE MAGIC broke in to make contact with City Princess and settled off the pace and off the rail,
started a bid past the three eighths pole, took a slim lead nearing the quarter and raced two deep through the far turn, but was caught mid-stretch and had
to settle for second. NORTHERN HEAT rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths, started a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole and raced in
the five path of the far turn and was along for third later yards. CITY PRINCESS was bumped at the break but moved clear and angled in nearing the three
quarter pole to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, gave up the lead nearest the rail toward the quarter and dropped back
weakening a furlong away. WALKNTHEPLANK raced well off the pace about the three path the first turn, left the turn outside and bid nearing the three
eighths pole, came through the far turn in the four path and showed little further. CANDYFORACAUSE was bumped then pinched back at the start, settled
back in the two and three paths and showed little response. LIL LINDER broke outward to make contact with Candyforacause then stalked the earlier pace,
though, faded past the half mile pole. HOT POSSEBILITY was through early.

Footnotes
OFFICER UNBRIDLED took quick control to rate a clear pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole and widened on the turn, then held on well
with steady insistence. BANNER MAN chased the pace and rounded the turn off the rail, lost ground under left hand urging toward the head of the lane, but,
finished well while settling for second best. MINDYOURPSANDQS gave chase and rounded the turn about the four path, angled inside the drifting Banner
Man at the eighth pole and raced evenly through the lane. JACKLIGHTING chased the leaders, raced in the three path of the turn and ran evenly through
the stretch. ASK ME HOW IKNOW gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. THREE PUNCH chased through the
backstretch, rounded the turn mostly off the rail, was eased out a furlong away and showed little more. IRON HENRY broke a step slow, picked up the
chase inside but was never a factor.

Footnotes
FAPPIANO ROCKET moved to the inside to draft Winter Is Here through the opening turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid toward
the three eighths pole, took the lead three wide midway on the far turn, drew clear into the lane then moved away through the final sixteenth. DEPUTY
JAMES stalked the pace two deep and challenged nearing the three eighths pole, raced a close factor two deep on the far turn, dueled for second
mid-stretch and held on. DEPUTY BEE settled off the rail the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, came
through the far turn about the five path, dug in for third the final yards and was gaining on the runner-up. MASTER YOO saved ground off the pace, bid
nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and finished evenly. WINTER IS HERE took the lead into the first turn and rated a slim lead
inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail midway on the far turn then weakened past the eighth pole.
I'MOVERTHEMOON saved early ground then eased out into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole then faded in the three path of
the far turn. GLOBAL INDIAN was reluctant to load but accelerated to a brief early lead then stalked in the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the
three eighths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. W V ROCKET MAN rounded the first turn about the five path, raced outside into the backstretch and
never factored. LUC D'VERMONT raced in the four path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. MAKANA broke a step slow and
raced in the five path the first turn, settled off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase toward the three eighths pole but faded past the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
TALENT EXPECTED accelerated to even terms nearing the three eighths pole and had the lead at the pole, drew clear passing the quarter, widened on the
turn and extended that margin under steady stretch urging. MY PRETTY EYES was hustled along to give chase, rounded the turn off the rail then dug in
through the stretch to take second later yards. SPLIT THE CHECK set the early pace then gave chase from the three eighths pole, dropped back at the rail
past the quarter and flattened inside the sixteenth pole. DYLADDIE came out to make contact with Punch Windsor at the start then picked up the chase
inside, raced at the rail on the turn and ran evenly through the lane. MAGNIFICENT ROCKET chased inside, rounded the turn at the rail and passed rivals
in the stretch. JUST ASK ME chased the leaders, raced in the five path of the turn and showed little more. CREATIVITY gave chase through the
backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail then weakened. REAL APPEAL and JUBA'S LADY were not factors. PUNCH WINDSOR was bumped on the chute
and never factored.

POWER FORWARD broke outward and settled off the pace off the rail, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn, took the
nod mid-stretch and dueled clear later yards. BRIGINTINE ISLAND came in at the break and raced with the pace two deep, dug in to the challenge of
Boundtobebad nearing the three eighths pole and dueled with the advantage from that point, drew briefly clear midway on the far turn but was caught
mid-stretch and flattened out the final yards. NAVY SWORD settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced in
the three path of the far turn and was along for third mid-stretch. BOUNDTOBEBAD raced with the pace inside and challenged toward the three eighths
pole, dueled at a close disadvantage at the rail from that point but dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened. WHOA BLACK BETTY saved
ground well off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little more. AZZURRA was pinched back at the
start and settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, showed only mild response through the backstretch and raced four wide on the far turn.
