Footnotes
LOLLY EXPRESS stalked the early pace from off the rail, was rushed into the turn, made a bid mid turn, dueled with MIDNIGHT DESTINY to late stretch
and prevailed for the win. MIDNIGHT DESTINY was not far back early, drifted out six wide through the turn, met the bid of the winner, dueled to late stretch
and finished second best. JONESEY WHO was allowed to settle early, raced five wide into the turn, angled in late and was along for third. DRIZZY pressed
the early pace, was carried out seven wide and weakened. FORGOTABOUTME set a pressured early pace from between rivals and faded. JEN'S BIG O
was unhurried early, raced along the inside into the turn and offered no late rally. SUNNY KAT was void of speed and was no threat.
