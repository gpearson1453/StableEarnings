Footnotes
AWESOME ANNMARIE lied off of the pace along the inside, tipped two wide into the turn, ranged up to the leaders three wide at the five sixteenths pole,
failed to keep pace with the pace-setter in upper stretch, but rebid for the lead under a long drive inside the final furlong as that foe tired, the drew clear
through the final sixteenth. CAFFEINE RUSH stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the pace setter approaching the five sixteenths pole as AWESOME
ANNMARIE ranged up alongside, grinded away at the leader's advantage inside of that rival through the final furlong, but was outkicked by that rival at the
sixteenth pole before achieving place at the wire. DIVINE MARTHA set the pace along the inside while FREEZER BURN pressured, shook off that foe at the
five sixteenths pole, drew clear of chasing rivals in upper stretch, but tired passing the furlong marker, got caught by AWESOME ANNMARIE at the
sixteenth pole, then was nailed on the wire for place. CARISMATICA lied far off of the pace two wide around the turn, and failed to factor. FREEZER BURN
prompted the pace setter from the outside, but weakened between horses at the five sixteenths pole. A D'ORO was outrun along the inside in a dull effort.
DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED, SIX-FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

SCARLETT SKY saved ground with the leading trio in his sights, came through an ample opening between horses in the two-path turning for home, took
over outside ADVANCE CASH in upper stretch and drew away under a mild drive. ADVANCE CASH rated along on a short lead for six furlongs, was no
match for the winner into the lane, and ran on clearly second best. TRADE DEAL was parked out three to four wide tracking the leaders for six furlongs, and
faded in the stretch. TAKE PROFIT pressed the pace two wide to the end of the second turn, and tired. Run-up distance unavailable.

Footnotes
MONTE NE prompted the pace two wide, took over from his inner counterpart approaching the three sixteenths pole, drew off under driving pressure in
upper stretch, then was wrapped up in the late stages. KHOZY MY BOY tracked the pace in the four path around the turn, produced a bid for place turning
for home as the leader assumed command, then chased that foe home while proving second best. SMOKE ALARM set the pace along the inside of the
eventual winner, got headed by that foe passing the quarter pole before giving way passing the three sixteenths marker, then was bested by KHOZY MY
BOY in midstretch for place, but stayed well clear of fourth. BERNIN' THRU GOLD lied off of the pace in the three path and between horses around the turn,
but faded around the bend and was outrun before surpassing a tiring foe late. PUTMAN stumbled at the start, recovered to stalk along the inside, but failed
to produce a bid before weakening through the lane.

Footnotes
ELLIEREESEASTON followed behind the leaders inside for three furlongs, maneuvered out three wide taking aim at the top of the stretch, collared I'M A
COCO PEBBLES a sixteenth out and drove clear. I'M A COCO PEBBLES set a pressured pace inside for a half-mile, shook off KATE'S KINGDOM leaving
the turn, could not handle the winner in deep stretch but remained clear of the rest. FLYING BLACK was outsprinted early, swung five wide rallying into the
stretch, then flattened out staying on her left lead. R TENDERONI checked sharply from between horses approaching the half-mile pole, raced three wide
around the turn and posed no threat. TRASHTHETRAILER bumped with BRITISH EDGE at the start, stayed in range for a half-mile three then four wide,
and tired into the stretch. HOLY SECRET made no impact three wide. KATE'S KINGDOM lodged a mild bid outside I'M A COCO PEBBLES with
five-sixteenths remaining, but gave way into the lane. TALK DIRTY checked sharply off heels leaving the half-mile marker, and dropped back steadily.
BRITISH EDGE bumped with TRASHTHETRAILER at the start, showed brief speed two wide, and retired.

Footnotes
HERO TIGER pressed two wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole as PUTTHEGLASSDOWN ranged up alongside, forged an advantage passing
the quarter pole, then held an advantage from his inner battling counterpart through the lane. FIELDER set the pace along the inside with HERO TIGER
pressing, got headed by that foe passing the quarter pole, fought on the wire, but failed to regain even terms. PUTTHEGLASSDOWN was last away and
hustled forward, gained ground into the turn to make a mild three wide bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, but tired in upper stretch. APACHE
BRAVE vied along the inside early on, took back to stalk passing the half mile pole, chased the leaders through the turn, but weakened in upper stretch.
GUACO broke through the gate before the start, then was outrun.

DON'T GET KHOZY saved ground in easy striking range for six furlongs, moved out and split horses rallying into the stretch, wrested command outside
NACHO MAMA past the eighth-pole and drove clear. DIZZY saved ground into the turn, began to advance while shifting out to the four-path leaving the
quarter-pole, had aim outside through the lane and finished willingly to get up for second. MISS PEPPINA prompted NACHO MAMA from outside, bid in
earnest with five-sixteenths remaining, stayed on to the furlong grounds and weakened. NACHO MAMA set the pace inside, relinquished command to
DON'T GET KHOZY past the eighth-pole and gave way. TIZ ENOUGH chased three wide early, and faded approaching the stretch. TIME TO TWO STEP
raced four wide, and tired under pressure coming off the turn.

Footnotes
TROPICAT was off slowly, trailed two wide into the turn, circled the field while shifting four wide turning for home, forged an advantage passing the furlong
marker, and drew off. FULLY LOADED set the pace along the inside, held an advantage in upper stretch, but offered mild resistance to the eventual winner
passing the furlong pole, and safely held place. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR rated off of the pace along the inside, awaited racing room turning for home before
splitting foes three wide in midstrech, and achieved show approaching the wire. INFINITE stalked along the inside, shifted two wide in upper stretch, but
only managed an evenly chasing grind through the lane, and lost show in the late stages. MALRAUX got fractious in the gate pre-race, pressed the pace
two wide, but faded in upper stretch. KRSTO SKYE tracked from midpack two wide, got outmoved by the eventual winner around the turn, shifted five wide
turning for home, and failed to mount a rally. NEW YORK'S FINEST lied forwardly placed outside of the leading duo around the turn, but was outkicked by
the eventual winner turning for home, and weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CRYSTALLE was unhurried to the third and final turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, caught ENJOYITWHILEWECAN from outside in deep stretch and
forged past. ENJOYITWHILEWECAN prompted the pace outside CAIRA, took over in upper stretch and kicked clear, but could not fend off the winner late.
SHE THROWS HEAT saved ground in the second flight, moved to the two-path around the final bend, and rallied mildly outside to pick up the show.
WHATDOESASHARKSAY raced in striking range two to three wide to the stretch, and lacked a solid closing response. CAIRA set the pace inside for a mile
and a quarter, and gave way through the lane. WOODFIN raced in the second flight two to three wide, and made no impact. LADY PANDA tired inside after
ten furlongs. The mile and a quarter fraction was unavailable.

Footnotes
DOMINEER set the pace along the inside, shook off bidding rivals turning for home, and drew clear in upper stretch. REGGAE REVOLUTION lied forwardly
placed four wide, made a three wide bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with the inner pace-setter in upper stretch, and
proved second best. SENSE A MILLION got a bit antsy in the gate pre-race, lied far off of the pace four wide around the turn, and stayed on for a minor
share. SAMMY'S TOWN broke outwardly and brushed a foe at the start, prompted the pace three to two wide, bid for the lead between horses at the five
sixteenths pole, but weakened in upper stretch. KIMURA lied off of the pace three wide despite steady urging, and failed to factor. DIENDA got fractious in
the gate, stalked along the inside early on, retreated to midpack into the turn, saved ground around the bend, but to no avail. TREVESS pressed the pace
two wide, chased into the turn, then faded through the lane. ROYAL JEWEL bobbled and was brushed by an inner foe at the start, then lied far off of the
pace along the inside and failed to make an impact.
