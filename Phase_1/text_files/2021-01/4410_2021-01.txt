wide through the stretch, drifted in late and was along for third. SWEET RYAN was allowed to settle early, raced between rivals and gave way. LADY JADE
was outrun early, went five wide into the turn and was no threat. IZZY B pressed the early pace from off the rail and faded. GLOA JEAN raced in mid pack
early, went eight wide into the turn and flattened out. GOLDEN GODDESS stalked from the inside and weakened. SECRETS OF MY SOUL was reserved
early, circled nine wide through the turn and was empty. ABRAAJEENA was unhurried early, went three wide into the turn and was no factor. SHE B SALTY
