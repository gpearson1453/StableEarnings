Footnotes
FOGGY FLIGHT was switched outside the pacesetter nearing the gap while being urged to a forward placing, continued with a steady bid to challenge for
command racing into upper stretch and went clear under firm encouragement. HIFALUTIN broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the
inside racing into the turn but proved no match for the winner entering the lane. JUST A BIT SASSY, urged to a forward placing three wide tracking just off
the leaders in the opening quarter, lost ground to those rivals entering the turn, shifted inwards entering upper stretch but continued well enough to edge a
rival for a share. MS. GENUINE was rated off the first flight in early stages, made some brief progress in the three path on the turn but had no closing bid.
MEMORABLE ANGEL tracked the leaders between foes in second flight on the backstretch and steadily faded into upper stretch. MOMENTS TO SAVER
tracked off the first flight along the inside in the opening quarter but faded early. COUNTESS JESSICA broke awkwardly, ducked out while going erratically
racing through the chute, shifted out to race four wide through the backstretch and trailed thereafter.

Footnotes
MARVELLA was rated inside a rival tracking just off the leaders racing to the backstretch, shifted out on the far turn gaining position three deep midway
through that bend, pressed the issue outside a rival racing past midstretch and narrowly prevailed on the wire under right handed pressure. PAYNTER
FEST, pulled her way to the lead shifting a bit off the rail racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, turned back a
rival's challenge leaving the far turn, then grudgingly resisted the winner through the stretch to just miss. LIGHTS DOWN LOW, in touch with the leaders
three wide in the opening stages, shifted in to press the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the far turn, weakened nearing upper stretch but
continued with interest to prevail for a share. HOLY DIVER, in touch with the first flight between foes racing to the first turn, was held up to track off the first
flight outside a rival into the backstretch, was fanned four wide racing through the far turn and faded into the lane. LAPULGA tracked off the second flight
racing three deep to the backstretch, angled inwards entering the far turn but offered no rally. WEST HORIZEN tracked off the second flight between foes to
the backstretch but offered no rally. TINK, off slowly, was settled inside rivals but dropped out early.

Footnotes
BELLA PIERINA broke readily, angled inwards racing through the chute attending a rival's pace under light rating to the backstretch, pressed the issue on
the far turn into upper stretch, shook clear while shifting to the inside and made the balance of the pace under firm handling. OVER TO YOU, reserved off
the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide through the far turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch
but produced a steady late response to prevail for the place honors. MAD GRACE tracked the leaders three wide in second flight in the opening five
furlongs, was prompted to advance in that path nearing upper stretch and continued with interest between foes while being outkicked by the top pair.
UNABRIDGED (IRE), reserved while angling inside leaving the chute to track off the second flight, shifted out four wide racing through upper stretch and
continued with an effort to improve position between foes. SAND DRIFT tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance entering the far turn but offered no closing bid. CLASSICAL MAGIC, urged to the lead while shifting a bit off the rail racing through the chute,
dictated the pace in hand on a narrow margin while angling to the rail racing to the backstretch, was prompted to maintain that advantage dueling for
command inside the eventual winner leaving the far turn and gave way midstretch. NOT ORBINARY angled to the inside early tracking just off the first flight,
came under pressure after five furlongs to pursue the leaders into the far turn but soon faded.

Footnotes
SECRET LIFE STYLE, in touch with the leaders three wide from the outset attending the pace, was prompted to challenge for command while being fanned
four wide into upper stretch but continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage in time under right handed pressure. MAGICAL TALE
prompted the pace between foes through the backstretch, edged forward racing through the turn disputing the issue on a narrow advantage, resisted the
winner's bid to late stages but came up second best. TANGLED WEB was urged inside rivals disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn,
shifted off the rail contesting the issue to the end but was outfinished by the top pair. PERFETTO angled to the rail early tracking the leaders from just out of
striking distance racing to the turn, lost some ground to the leaders nearing upper stretch, then shifted four wide in the closing stages while continuing with
an effort to improve position. SIX CIDER broke slowly, switched outside rivals on the backstretch regaining contention racing into the turn, angled to the rail
nearing upper stretch while briefly advancing inside the leaders but lacked the needed late kick. ARCHIVERO, a bit restless before the start, dropped out
early.

Footnotes
KING ANDRES, forwardly placed from the outset stalking a rival's pace, was urged to bid for command between foes leaving the midway point of the far
turn, drifted out carrying out ESTILO PELIGROSO racing into upper stretch, continued to dispute the issue past midstretch, was jostled while being carried
into the path of ANALYZEYOURVISION in the closing stages but narrowly prevailed under firm left handed pressure. ANALYZEYOURVISION broke readily,
dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the backstretch, dueled inside foes leaving the far turn, drifted out in upper stretch, then was
carried in racing past the sixteenth marker while resisting grudgingly but just failed to contain the winner. ESTILO PELIGROSO, unsettled in the paddock,
tracked the leaders three deep between foes as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, advanced in that path entering the far turn to challenge
for command nearing upper stretch, was carried out by the eventual winner entering the lane, lugged inwards under pressure leaving midstretch bumping
that rival and was just outfinished. ANGEL'S ENTRY was settled between foes, then dropped out last entering the backstretch, swung out five wide racing
into upper stretch and made some belated progress to close the gap. FARM STRONG was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch,
saved ground on the far turn, split foes just off the inside to gain position inside foes racing past midstretch to loom inside the leaders, steadied in the closing
stages when losing his path, then altered course to bid four wide between foes nearing the wire but was just outkicked. PRINCE VALESKI tracked the
leaders four wide leaving the chute to race as part of the second flight to the backstretch, continued in that path making brief progress nearing the far turn
but came up empty approaching the lane. DRILL BIT, off slowly, settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. LORD
BYRON angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight racing to the far turn but came up empty in the drive. RECLINER tracked the
leaders between foes in second flight racing to the far turn and steadily faded nearing upper stretch. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF FARM
STRONG LODGED CLAIMS OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF ANALYZEYOURVISION AND KING ANDRES ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN LATE
STRETCH WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY, BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
BAYDAR broke readily, was urged inside a rival disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing a bit off the rail into the turn, was headed between calls
racing into upper stretch but continued with a game response under brisk right handed pressure to turn back WE MISS SUSIE, then hold ALL GOOD TIMES
on a safe margin to the end. The latter tracked off the first flight outside foes through the backstretch, was prompted to advance entering the turn, shifted out
four wide in upper stretch and continued willingly to late stages to close the gap. WE MISS SUSIE broke readily, forced the pace outside the eventual
winner racing through the backstretch into the turn, struck the front between calls racing into upper stretch but emptied out leaving the furlong marker.
SUZIE'SSTEPPINOUT tracked off the first flight three deep between foes in the opening quarter, angled to the rail entering the turn while making brief
progress nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. CAUGHT UP IN YOU, between foes in second flight in the opening stages, dropped back
from that position nearing the turn while shifting out, angled five wide in upper stretch but had no closing response. MARYNMIKE tracked off the first flight
nearest the rail in the opening quarter but faded from contention early.

Footnotes
JEHA, reserved from well off the second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily gained position between foes after a half, came around a
rival on the far turn to split foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch, moved to challenge inside the pacesetter leaving the furlong marker, shifted out
under left handed pressure leaving the chute gap racing past the sixteenth marker making light contact with WESTWARD LOOK but was going well enough
to gain the advantage in time. The latter angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter from out of striking distance leading the second flight to the backstretch,
made steady progress to challenge for command racing into upper stretch, held sway past the furlong marker but lost some momentum when bumped by
the winner in late stages to just lose the advantage. OSPREY, off awkwardly, settled last to the backstretch, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch
and was going well late. INDY LYON tracked the pacesetter outside a rival as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, advanced in tandem with
that foe to lodge a three wide bid entering upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. FLEETRIDGE angled to the inside early tracking off the second
flight racing to the backstretch but offered no rally. KICK IT CHARLIE tracked just off rivals in second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved
ground on the far turn and steadily faded nearing upper stretch. AHIMELECH sped clear of the field while angling to the rail leaving the chute, set the pace
on a clear margin racing into the far turn and gave out once headed in upper stretch. ALWAYS SPECIAL tracked off the second flight outside a rival to the
backstretch, was shuffled a bit in close quarters after a half and soon dropped out. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
INTO THE STRETCH RUN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
NEVER MY LOVE went clear soon after the break, dictated the pace in hand while angling over racing to the turn, was roused left handed to extend the
margin midstretch and was taken in hand nearing the wire once the issue was decided. CATTALEYA RONITH shifted out three deep early while being
prompted in pursuit of the pacesetter in tandem with several rivals, steadily gained position between foes nearing upper stretch, angled to the inside
entering the stretch and continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. CLAP FOR ME, urged between pursing the pacesetter as part of the second
flight racing to the turn, angled to the rail nearing upper stretch, was taken in hand momentarily in close quarters entering the lane, then altered course to
race three wide between foes in the closing stages while continuing with interest to narrowly prevail for a share. STAR OF SHANGHAI settled well off the
second flight while angling to the inside racing to the turn, swung out four wide entering the lane and continued to improve position. MARLEE ducked out at
the start, settled outside foes racing to the turn, then was fanned five wide while gaining some position between foes late. V K PRINCESS dropped back
early, then raced six wide through the stretch. THE LITTLE KITTY was urged four wide into the turn pursuing the leader as part of the second flight, shifted
inwards gaining second racing into upper stretch but gave out leaving the furlong marker. BY MY OWN, urged inside rivals pursuing the pacesetter as part
of the second flight emptied out nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
MAYRHOFEN was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground entering the far turn, came around a tiring foe nearing
upper stretch to bid along the rail in upper stretch, skirmished for command inside foes past midstretch but edged forward in time under firm left handed
pressure to prevail. IDLE TIME worked his way to the inside leaving the chute to track off the second flight just outside the eventual winner racing to the
backstretch, steadily gained position between rivals just off the inside to split foes midstretch but was just outkicked. SIMMARDSTRIKE tracked just off the
first flight along the inside while pulling a bit against restraint racing to the backstretch, tipped out nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance,
was fanned four wide leaving midstretch and was just outkicked. ANDREW THE BULL, in touch with the pacesetter prompting that rival into the backstretch,
pressed the issue into the far turn, went clear racing into upper stretch, shifted to the three path resisting challenges from between foes past midstretch but
yielded nearing the wire. ST JOE VIPER tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted out entering the lane but had no closing
bid. NEAT STREET settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled five wide entering the lane but never proved a serious threat.
OUTSTANDING DEBT settled last racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. FREE FLAYME, urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the
pace on a narrow margin racing to the far turn and gave way abruptly nearing upper stretch. HACIENDA BLVD, off slowly, switched out three wide racing
into the first turn gaining a position just off the second flight racing to the backstretch and steadily faded nearing the lane.
