was well placed just off the pace, made a bid in the two path on the far turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong, drifted in at the sixteenth-pole and
was outfinished while clear for the place. OLYMPIC CHAMPION broke in and a bit slow, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was ridden along
while inside early on the far turn then moved to the two path around the five-sixteenths, came three wide into the stretch under the whip then quickly angled
out six wide and just got up for the show. LOVING LUCKY was hustled to the lead, set the pace on the inside, was asked when confronted on the far turn,
lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back while carried in at the sixteenth-pole and tired. DOUBLE TOUGH TIGER was taken back on
the initial straightaway, went two to three wide while keen between foes on the first turn, settled more kindly on the backstretch, saved ground while urged
along on the far turn and failed to respond. TEXAS ROYALTY was rated under a tight hold while five then four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the
outside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, chased four wide on the far turn and retreated. BIRTHDAY PARTY was hustled from the start, went

outside the quarter-pole, drifted in under a drive in upper stretch, gained under a left-handed whip into the final furlong, drifted out while closing fast at the

HONEY went around the first turn in the two path, settled in the middle of the spread out field, was urged along while moving from the inside to the two path
on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and was along for the show. HAVINFUNYET rounded the first turn in the two path, raced well back
in the field, went three then four wide on the far turn and gained ground but failed to threaten. MARRAZANO followed the clear leader while saving ground,
was urged along on the far turn and came up empty. MISS BROOKSIDE raced inside early on the first turn then moved to the two path, lagged at the rear,

took the lead outside the quarter-pole then shook clear into upper stretch, drifted out while drawing off into the final furlong, continued to drift out to about the
sixteenth-pole then was eased up late while much the best. LEMON CHILL bumped with a foe while keen off heels at the seven-eighths then was taken up,
went three to four wide on that bend, settled off the pace, moved closer with a half-mile to run, chased two then three wide on the far turn then was driven
four wide into the stretch, drifted out while well behind the winner around the sixteenth-pole and safely secured the place. BET YOUR BANKROLL broke out
then was hustled, went three then four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was ridden along while three to four wide on the far turn then driven five
wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while along for the show. ORB'S SOUL was keen in the two then three path under snug restraint on
the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, moved clear with a half-mile to run, vied inside of two foes while along the rail on the far turn, dropped back
into upper stretch and tired. MISS COMMISH bumped with a rival at the seven-eighths, went four to five wide on the first turn, settled at the rear on the
outside, went around the far turn in the two path, moved out twice in the stretch and was no factor. RUNAWAY DREAM broke alertly then angled in while
going to the front, raced inside on the first turn, contested the pace on the inside of a foe, dropped back nearing the half-mile pole then moved out, re-bid
under urging at the seven-sixteenths, vied in the three path on the far turn and capitulated.

in upper stretch, drifted out while battling with the runner-up at the sixteenth-pole then was straightened by the rider and moved clear under steady handling.
BENBOW CAT broke in at the start, sped clear and set the pace, raced inside on the turn, was set down in upper stretch, battled with the winner into the
final furlong, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while just able to get the place. BUNKIE'S SONG tracked the pace on the outside,
chased three then two wide while inside of a foe on the turn, pursued the top two in the stretch, kept on well to the finish and just missed the place while
able to get the show. FIFTY PROTECTION was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, steadied inside the five-sixteenths, moved out in
upper stretch, drifted out at the furlong marker then raced erratically and lacked the needed kick. APACHE TEARS was bumped at the start then forced in
and off slow, moved out while taken under a tight hold early, was let out four wide on the turn then came five wide into the stretch, drifted out near the
furlong marker and gained some but failed to seriously threaten. BANQUET CHEF settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went three
wide on the turn, moved out some under a drive while racing with his head held high in upper stretch and failed to rally. SMITTYS PATRIARCH veered in at
the start and bumped with a foe, was well spotted just off the pace, went three then four wide while given his cue on the turn, came out under a drive in
upper stretch and lacked the needed response. GYPSY'S SOULMATE was off slow, settled near the back, raced inside to the two path under urging on the
turn, steadied outside the quarter-pole, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to threaten. YANK CRIME was off slow, dropped well behind, went
two to three wide on the turn and trailed. (Rail at 17 Feet)

MAKE'N TRACKS went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was urged two then three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch
then tipped further out, rallied to take the lead into the final furlong, shook clear outside the sixteenth-pole then powered away under steady urging. EASY
TO MISS went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, chased four wide on the far turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, spun five wide into
the stretch, took the lead at the three-sixteenths, lost the advantage around the furlong marker and proved no match for the winner while clear for the place.
PHARAOH'S KITTEN went around the first turn in the two path, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the two path on the far turn, took the lead
coming to the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch then lost the advantage, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but held the
show. NO KA OI broke out and bumped with a foe, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved closer while urged
three to four wide on the far turn and had nothing left. JUST GUN IT rounded the first turn in the two path, settled in third position, was urged in the two path
on the far turn and came up empty. RANGE OF MOTION was bumped solidly at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, dropped back
leaving the backstretch, went two to three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to respond. ADEEB went three wide on the first
turn, lagged at the rear, saved ground on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and was no factor. MAGA COUNTRY went four to five wide
on the turns, came six wide into the stretch and also failed to respond. TAPIT'S TEMPLE was keen under some restraint early, set the pace on the inside,
was headed approaching the five-sixteenths and faded.

Footnotes
IN GOOD SPIRITS settled on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, rallied outside under a right-handed whip, drifted in
while gaining inside the furlong marker and closed strongly to get up late and prevail. YES IT'S GINGER showed good speed and set the pace, vied inside
on the turn, shook off a foe in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while able to get the place. DANCE RHYTHMS was
well placed in third position, went two then three wide on the turn then was driven four wide into the stretch, chased the runner-up into the final sixteenth and
finished with good courage to get the show. SHE CAN'T SING was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, gained
under a drive into the final furlong, chased into the final sixteenth, steadied behind horses late and just missed the show. WHIMSICAL MUSE dropped back
while crowded just after the start, settled at the rear, went three then two wide on the turn, angled out near the furlong marker and improved position.
ORIGINATOR settled off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved out at the furlong marker and lacked the
needed response. LUVIN BULLIES settled on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
HEAVEN ESCAPE settled towards the rear, went three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch then moved further out around the three-sixteenths
and was no factor. STERLING MISS settled towards the back, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, spun three wide into the
stretch, moved out near the furlong marker and failed to rally. VOMBA stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the turn, drifted out
into upper stretch and tired. (Rail at 17 Feet)
