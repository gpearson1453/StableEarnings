MIT MAZEL sprinted to the early lead, set the pace under rating while saving ground on the turn, responded when asked in upper stretch and was kept to
her business in the drive. TRIPLE DIGIT , two wide around the turn, gamely chased the winner through the stretch. ITALIAN DRESSING advanced three
deep on the turn to reach a striking position entering the stretch then weakened. WHAT GOES ON TOUR hugged the inner rail and offered a mild gain late.
BLESS AND HONOR raced in the two path on the turn and was not a factor. SHE'S FOREVER , forwardly placed along the inner rail entering the turn,
swung to the four path leaving the bend and gave way.

Footnotes
EMPERADORA dueled inside, gained a short lead leaving the far turn, shook clear heading towards the quarter pole, increased her lead under a stiff drive
in mid stretch, drifted out a bit but held firm while kept to task. STEELY BAND rated kindly while saving ground, took closer order along the rail past the five
sixteenths, eased out to have aim past the three sixteenths, attempted to lay in a bit but kept on giving effort to the wire. CAPRICHOSA stumbled at the
break, recovered and settled off the rail, circled four wide making progress into the lane but failed to seriously follow through. WARRIOR'S BLADE bobbled
at the break and was off slow, lagged off the pace, cut the corner into the lane but lacked a solid run. MOONLIGHT MISS tracked the dueling leaders while
three wide, was put to pressure past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on into the lane and gave way. AWESOME BUTTERFLY was sent up to contest the
pace soon after the break, dueled on a short lead outside the winner past the half mile pole, chased from the five sixteenths and weakened.

GAMING JACK , two wide inside horses on the turn, found room along the inner rail through the stretch, closed determinedly and took the lead approaching
the wire. YOU ARE AWESOME saved ground on the turn, moved to the two path in upper stretch, gained a clear lead near the eighth pole and finished
willingly. THEDUKE OF HAZZARD lacked speed, raced in the two path mid way on the turn, swung to the five path entering the stretch and rallied outside
foes. NEW YORK ONE hugged the inner rail disputing the pace, drifted out turning for home and faded in the drive. DYNAMIC DAY , three deep chasing the
pace on the turn, weakened in the drive. SAVATIANO bumped with MY CANDY BIZ leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail on the turn and was
outrun. MY CANDY BIZ bumped with SAVATIANO leaving the starting gate, raced in the three path on the turn and faltered. CROWN AND COKE disputed

Footnotes
DUDLEY SQUARE , with the pace four deep past the three quarter pole, gave chase three deep leaving the three eighths, kept on doggedly under right
handed rousing, overtook the leader just past the sixteenth marker, wandered outward a bit and was edging away at the wire. GENTLEMAN JOE , a bit
keen early on, was allowed to go on and bid along the rail to take command into the backstretch, handled outside pressure after settling, moved clear after a
half mile, was called for his best past the three sixteenths, dug in when confronted past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. SASSY KING lagged well
back while saving ground, continued inside into the lane, eased out near mid stretch and offered a mild late response. CROUCHELLI lagged far back while
outside of a rival, raced three wide into the lane, made a mild run between foes past the three sixteenths and churned on to the wire while not threatening.
INSIDE RISK , three wide between rivals forcing the pace, gave hard pursuit past the five sixteenths then weakened in the final furlong.
FORFIFTYFIVEROCKET settled in the clear and off of the battling quartet, came under pressure leaving the far turn, angled four wide into the lane and
faded. PADRINO'S HEART sped clear early, was joined from both sides nearing the backstretch, forced the pace to the far turn, remained in touch to about
the quarter pole then succumbed.

Footnotes
SILENT SERVICE hugged the inner rail setting a pressured pace, eagerly drew out through the stretch and was hit with the whip once in mid stretch. JOHN
THE BEAR stalked the pace around the turn, loomed three deep entering the stretch and flattened out. KANT BEAT THE ROCK lacked speed, saved
ground around the turn, angled out in upper stretch and rallied outside rivals. FLAT CAT prompted the pace outside the winner and weakened the final
furlong. DREAM HAPPY raced in mid pack early, was three wide leaving the turn and weakened. INDEFATIGABLE saved ground on the turn and
weakened. WEBB was outrun. STRIKHEDONIA trailed.

REDACTED REPORT broke a step slow, recovered and accelerated between foes to reach contention, dropped in and dueled along the rail under rating,
was roused clear in upper stretch, kept on under right handed pressure past the furlong grounds and dug in late to fend off EL ROJO. EL ROJO tracked the
duel while saving ground, eased out advancing into the lane, straightened to make a steady bid but was denied. THE EXCEPTION drafted back off the early
pace, dropped in to save ground, cut the corner into the lane, eased out progressing past the sixteenth marker and gained. EXCHANGE FEVER was rated
back early on, circled five to six wide into the lane, advanced past the furlong grounds then flattened out late. IMAGINE WINNING broke a step slow, raced
off the pace between rivals but failed to mount a serious bid. LITTLE BAY stalked the early pace, was caught between foes from the far turn to the quarter
pole, pursued to mid stretch then faded. QUEST OF GLORY , away alertly, got into a battle outside the winner soon after, drifted out entering the lane then
weakened in the final furlong. NIC NIC BOOM , four wide outside rivals, came up empty.

Footnotes
BELLE TAPISSERIE showed speed along the rail down the backstretch, dropped back a bit entering the turn, swung outside mid way on the bend, took the
lead outside horses in upper stretch, lugged in near the eighth pole and drew off under urging. CAREY TIMES gained the lead leaving the backstretch,
hugged the inner rail leaving the turn, weakened in the drive and held the place. MO GOTCHA , three deep leaving the backstretch, prompted the pace, was
in the two path leaving the turn and faded in the drive. W W SPRINGTIME saved ground around the turn, angled out for the drive and lacked a rally.
ROBEY'S BOY was not a factor. PHANTOM RO hopped slightly at the break, raced two wide on the turn, swung out in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
GOLDEN WARRIOR veered out at the break, dropped back and settled, commenced a wide run leaving the far turn, circled four wide into the stretch, kept
on grinding under pressure, collared the leader near the sixteenth marker, forged ahead late and prevailed. SWING YOUR SWORD vied three deep early,
emerged in a duel to the outside of a rival leaving the far turn, remained in a tussle into the stretch, shook clear under a drive past the three sixteenths, dug
in when confronted then ceded grudgingly in the final yards. WHAT THE FLASH , sluggish in the opening sixteenth, edged up while saving ground heading
to the half mile marker, angled out leaving the far turn, circled five wide with momentum into the lane but could only muster up a mild kick on the final
seventy yards. GET LIT broke a step slow, saved ground making some headway into the turn, eased out to pursued past the five sixteenths, altered out in
upper stretch but lacked the needed finish. GOLDEN G rushed up to the inside of rivals and put a head in front after a quarter mile, dueled to upper stretch,
stayed willingly to about the furlong grounds then faded. WHO'S COUNTING lagged well back, raced towards the inside in the drive and had a slight
response. GREY INVASION failed to menace. RUNAWAY CROWN was floated out a bit at the break, stalked the dueling leaders while off the rail, failed to
kick on heading to the five sixteenths and weakened. ORIENTATED gave early chase and tired. FEROCIOUS STORM vied early between foes and
faltered.

Footnotes
EGO TRIP lacked speed, circled the far turn three wide, was floated to the six path in mid stretch, closed outside horses and took the lead late.
LUDICROUS MODE trailed to the stretch, split foes inside the eighth pole and rallied on his left lead. KORCZAK sped to the early lead, set the pace along
the rail, remained on his left lead in the drive and tired. MUHLENBERG stalked the pace, saved ground the far turn, dropped back a bit in upper stretch then
passed tired rivals. RUNNER RUNNER INDY , three wide the first turn, raced along the inner rail on the far turn and weakened. OUTSIDE THE BOX three
wide the far turn, advanced to the eighth pole then gave way. SEATTLE RIC , four deep the first turn, had a mild two wide move on the far turn then gave
way. AUDACIOUS QUALITY was no factor.
