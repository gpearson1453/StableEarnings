Footnotes
MARVELOUS RED set the early pace then pressed the pace from the inside drew clear late while driving. DREAM TWISTER stalked the pace from the
three path then angled out on the turn and made a late rally to be up for the place. LULLABY BANDIT dueled from the two path and faded in the stretch.
SILKY'S DANCE was shuffled back at the start then rushed to contention and flattened out late. NOT FADE AWAY was unhurried early then steadily
advanced and circled the field on the turn but failed to sustain bid. FLASH OF PEPPER stalked the pace from the two path then angled out and lacked the
late response. REMEMBER ME POP chased the leaders and gave an even effort. BIG COUNT failed to menace. CHAN MAN was not a threat. POINT TO
THE GREEN was not a factor.

WRONGWAYHIGHWAY was well placed in the two path then made a late rally to be up in final strides. COAST GUARDSMAN set the pace from the inside
then drew clear but was caught late. RUN AWAY SON was unhurried early in the two path then steadily advanced and had his best strides late. D'FESTIVE
CAT gave an even effort. WICKED FITZ stalked the pace from the three path then made a bid on the turn but failed to sustain that bid. SHUGS LIL BRO
chased the leaders from the three path and flattened out in the drive. MEAN CRUISER was not a factor. CHELSEA'S GLORY was not a factor.

Footnotes
AT ONCE was well place in the two path then steadily advance on the backstretch closed willingly on the turn and drew clear in the stretch under steady
urging. ASHLEY ASTRAY set the early pace then was caught at the head of the stretch and was clearly second best. SWEET MILAGROS was allowed to
settle on the inside then made a late rally for show. NICKYS GUITAR broke to the outside then was unhurried early in the three path made a bid on the final
turn and flattened out. MISSGREELEY'SSONG chased the leaders from the two path and tired late. PADDY O'BELLE trailed the field early and passed
tiring rivals in the drive. INSEPARABLE raced in the middle of the pack from the four path and faded. BATTY was forwardly placed and gave way. CAJUN
SHOTS was not a factor.

two path then led briefly and just missed in the drive. GO GET THAT raced in the middle of the pack then rallied to be up for the show. SOUTHPINE GIFT
was allowed to settle from the two path and passed tiring rivals. WRATH was unhurried early from the three path then made a bid on the turn and improved
positon. MUTINEER raced in the middle of the pack from the inside made a bid on the backstretch but lacked room on the turn and weakened in the drive.
SUPER FACTOR was not a threat. UNCLE BIRD was not a factor. KING ZIPPY chased the leaders from the two path and gave way. D'TUFF CAT REY set
