COAST TO COAST took to the outside while not far back midway on the backstretch, moved three wide to command before a half then drew away under
mild urging. DUCK POND ROAD came out into the four path while advancing on the turn then flattened out in the lane. WRANGLE was reluctant to load,
broke slowly, raced the six path around the turn and outfinished tired ones. MOUNTAIN ON FIRE took command at once, made the pace two wide for about
a half then tired. BRIDOLOGIST didn't break sharply, moved to press inside the early leader and tired. WELL IN TUNE was outrun. BILL'S MAFIA briefly
showed speed then stopped.

VENOMOUS STATE ducked out into FREE DANCER leaving the gate, moved along the rail to press inside that one and ran clear leaving the furlong
grounds. DUPREE was slow to settle, stayed well out from the rail around the turn and finished fast outside. LONG MAY YOU RUN had position outside,
raced three wide into the stretch, gave his best into the final furlong but couldn't stay with the winner. MY TRAIN stayed inside and gained mildly. FREE
DANCER was bumped soundly a few strides out of the gate, moved to gain command shortly after, raced two wide into the stretch and weakened. CAPT.

Footnotes
NO SENSE was never far back, rallied two wide between horses around the turn, ran clear in early stretch and held under steady urging. SHOWER THE
PEOPLE wasn't far back between horses, raced two wide around the turn and closed willingly. SENOR RICCI raced three wide outside the winner to the
stretch, fell back and continued evenly. LUNAR IMAGE was slow early, stayed inside around the turn, angled out through the lane and improved position.
BILETNIKOFF lagged to the stretch then found best stride too late. FUDGE tired inside. RACEHORSEINARED moved to a clear lead midway on the
backstretch, stayed inside while making the pace to the stretch then tired. MOOCHIE MAN raced four wide and tired. DUKE OF HEARTS stopped.
