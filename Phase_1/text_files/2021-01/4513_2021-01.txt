Footnotes
COPPER settled off the pace while racing three wide, closed through the lane and was up and clear late. BIG CHEEKS lagged well back inside, moved up
four wide around the far turn, rallied widest and was up for the place in the final strides. ROSEY'S INVASION set the pace inside, kicked clear nearing the
quarter pole, held clear past the sixteenth pole and wilted late. OUR WEST INDY was bumped several strides after the start, checked entering the first turn,
prompted the pace two wide and weakened in the lane. HOITY TOITY was carried out entering the first turn, angled in early on that bend, continued to save
ground from there and failed to menace. KEYPIT never threatened while racing two and three wide. JEANIE VEE stalked the pace inside and faded in the
drive. EMPEROR'S SONG broke out and bumped OUR WEST INDY a bit after the start, checked repeatedly around the first turn, saved ground and played
no further factor. PATRICIA H bore out around both turns, was eased around the far turn, pulled up near the sixteenth pole and walked off.

Footnotes
TOPO GRIGIO tracked outside the leaders three then four wide, wrested command outside EMOLGA in mid stretch, and bested that one to the finish all
out. EMOLGA went up to engage ROYAL MISTRESS for the lead midway along the backstretch, shifted two then three wide nursing a short lead around the
turn, responded when challenged by TOPO GRIGIO, yielded through the late stages and was clearly second best. LA GATA NEGRA raced three to four
wide around the turn, rallied into third through upper stretch and stayed clear of the others. TENNESSEE COTTON came five wide off the turn, and could
not gain. ROYAL MISTRESS led early, vied outside EMOLGA into the turn, and gave way approaching the stretch. STARSHIP BLANCA raced close up
inside for six furlongs, and had nothing left. BOATLOADOFNERVE hit the left side of the gate and came out slowest, and was finished soon after going a
half-mile.

NO DECAF pressed the pace three wide, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, put away the pace rivals nearing the quarter pole, continued on the left
lead in the lane, drifted out under left-handed urging leaving the sixteenth pole, finally switched leads in deep stretch and dug in. RAY AREWETHEREYET
broke inwardly and bumped MOANAS POWER into SKYFLY, advanced four wide around the turn, steadily gained outside of the winner through the lane
but could not get past. FRANKLY MY DEAR dueled inside of two foes for three-eighths and weakened. SKYFLY was bumped at the start, saved ground
well back and never threatened. MOANAS POWER was bumped between foes at the start, dueled two wide between rivals and retreated after three
furlongs.

Footnotes
REINAGOL broke sharply and vied early outside MADEMOISELLE NOVA, gained the upper hand near the quarter-pole, and edged clear late while shying
in and out from the whip. FIRST HOUR advanced in the two-path coming to the quarter-pole, continued willingly and was up outside late for the place.
MADEMOISELLE NOVA contested the pace inside REINAGOL, and weakened through the stretch. NEVER AT ALL (FR) broke slowly and was outsprinted
two wide to the head of the lane, and gained mildly for the last major share. MADEIRA WINE chased three wide, and lacked the needed closing response.
SWEET BABY RAELYNN was outrun near the inside. FAMILY FRIEND broke slowly and made no impact.

BLESSED JOURNEY was in tight at the start, tracked the pace three wide, reached near even terms in upper stretch, vied outside to the sixteenth, drew
clear while sticking on the left lead and held safe under a drive. GANGLY tracked the pace inside, swung four wide in upper stretch, rallied outside but ran
out of ground. TIO WIL prompted the pace in the three path, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, vied inside of the winner to the sixteenth marker and
weakened late. MOONOVERTHEBAYOU failed to menace while racing four wide. ROUGH ENTRY set the pace along the rail and was through after a half.
ROCKET BLAST was fractious in the gate then had only brief speed two wide. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
CREW DRAGON saved ground tucked in behind the early leaders, got shuffled back awaiting room on the far turn, remained behind a wall of horses and
pinned to the fence at the top of the stretch, maneuvered off the inside and split foes late and would not be denied. AVIANO was unhurried early toward the
inside, advanced while strung out five wide on the far turn, shifted in slightly through the furlong grounds and finished gamely outside the winner. VAN
DUSEN (GB) broke to the lead, was nursed along with a narrow advantage to the stretch, dug in stubbornly along the rail but was edged through the closing
yards. PLEASE THE PHAROAH had the rail early, went along in the second flight of a bunched field around the far turn two to three wide, steadied slightly
in mid stretch as AVIANO went by from his outside, moved out a path and ran on willingly. FINGAL was a bit reluctant to load, bumped with FUTURE
VICTORY coming out, lodged a three-wide bid after six furlongs, but flattened out through the lane. FUTURE VICTORY bumped with FINGAL at the start,
put in a four-wide run to contention on the far turn, could not sustain the bid and steadied giving way in upper stretch. LUMBERJACK pressed the pace
outside VAN DUSEN for six furlongs, and gave way turning for home. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF PLEASE THE PHAROAH AGAINST AVIANO
FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
AYCAPOTE set the pace along the rail, drew clear rounding the far turn and widened under a drive in the lane. TONS OF GOLD was bumped at the start,
advanced four wide around the turn, could not threaten the winner in the lane, dueled outside of PURECRAZIDUDE through the lane for the place and
prevailed in that battle. PURECRAZIDUDE prompted the winner two wide, was unable to keep pace with that foe nearing the lane, battled inside for the
place and was narrowly outfinished. SAINT LARNED was bumped at the start, chased the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. MR. CESCO was bumped
at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. SENZAZIONE was in range three wide and faded nearing the lane. TEXTPECTATION was sluggish early
and never a factor while racing three wide. POWER (BRZ) was bumped at the start, saved ground around the turn and made little impact. CAPTAIN D was
outrun while racing four wide. BABY BROTHER was bounced around at the start, raced three to four wide and made little impact.

Footnotes
EL PILLO took command after the start, rated along inside to the stretch, dug in when challenged by SURPRISE FACTOR and held tenaciously to get the
decision. SURPRISE FACTOR prompted the pace outside EL PILLO from the start, had aim through a long drive and could not get past. ACCESSIBLE got
bothered by POPPY'S BOYS and steadied shortly after the start, went along in the second flight two wide to the far turn, shifted out to the four-path at the
head of the stretch, and gained late outside the top two finishers. SHARETHEBLAME was bothered by POPPY'S BOYS at the break and spotted the field a
couple lengths, saved ground well back for six furlongs, moved out three wide approaching the lane and gained late for a share. POPPY'S BOYS broke out
shutting off SHARETHEBLAME, came in after that forcing ACCESSIBLE TO steady, went to the first turn very rank between horses and bumped BIG
TREASURE, and continued on unable to gain. BODIE CODY was forwardly placed inside to the far turn, and faded. LEADING FACTOR stayed in range for
six furlongs two wide, and tired. BIG TREASURE received a bump from POPPY'S BOYS while outside that rival heading into the first turn, and dropped
back soon after going a half-mile.

SUMMER KID settled off the early pace scramble two wide, angled four wide to advance widest near the three-eighths pole, bid outside out ANSWER IN in
upper stretch, vied to deep stretch and prevailed. ANSWER IN vied between rivals down the backstretch, dueled at the rail around the turn, dug in inside of
the winner in the lane and gave way grudgingly. KID BOURBON raced off the pace outside, advanced five wide around the far turn and flattened out a bit in
the lane. SOUNION vied inside of three rivals down the backstretch, dropped back a bit under some urging around the turn, was shuffled further back
between the five-sixteenths pole and upper stretch, angled three wide near the three-sixteenths and improved position in the lane. SCAR saved ground off
the pace, swung five wide near the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. TIZ RYE TIME failed to menace while racing two wide. LAVERY dueled four
wide down the backstretch, chased three wide around the turn and came up empty in the lane. AJAAWEED raced three wide and was through early.
TAPABILITY stumbled after the start, dueled between rivals down the backstretch and retreated nearing the lane.

WAR STOPPER broke slowly, moved to contention around the first turn four wide, took over outside RED CRESCENT after a half-mile, came under a ride
by midway on the far turn fending off CLEAR DESTINATION, faced a threat from TELEPHONE TALKER into the lane, and had enough to stay clear while
drifting out under heavy pressure. MISCHIEF AFOOT broke slowly and was outrun early near the inside, circled four wide coming off the far turn, and rallied
on the far outside for the place. TELEPHONE TALKER saved ground allowed to settle early, put in a four-wide run to loom a threat approaching the stretch,
but flattened out late. CLEAR DESTINATION advanced outside WAR STOPPER entering the far turn, put in a sustained challenge to upper stretch, but
gave way late. YOUCANTCATCHCURLIN showed early speed three then two wide, but faded after a half-mile. RED CRESCENT led early inside, yielded to
challengers up the backstretch, and faded steadily. AMERICAN TATTOO (ARG) broke slowly, went up to get the lead between RED CRESCENT and WAR
STOPPER into the backstretch, but was finished before completing six furlongs.

Footnotes
LULLULA hit the starting gate, raced off the pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, seized command in upper stretch and drew clear under
a drive. SILKY WARRIOR (IRE) saved ground in midpack, swung out in upper stretch and soundly bumped SMART SPENDING, then finished strongly
while staying on the left lead through the stretch. FOXTROT SEVILLE raced in range three wide, bid four wide around the far turn, remained in contention
through midstretch then flattened out late. MISSION POSSIBLE broke in a tangle, was rank entering the first turn, raced well back three wide around that
bend, advanced four wide around the far turn, fanned widest into the lane, was bumped out in upper stretch then had a mild rally outside. KEITANY saved
ground off the pace, waited for room around the turn, got through in upper stretch and improved position. SMART SPENDING raced well back three wide,
moved up three wide between foes rounding the far turn, was slammed between foes in upper stretch then stayed on to pass some tired foes. B C BELLE
rated in range three wide, advanced between foes around the far turn and faded in the lane. MA REVE stalked the pace two and three wide, took the lead
nearing the quarter pole, vied to midstretch and tired. THEUNCAPTUREDLADY steadied at the start, saved ground well back, went about three wide around
the turn and never threatened. ESTELLINA stalked the pace from the rail, steadied midway around the far turn and dropped back inside.
BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY hit the starting gate, steadied into the first turn, saved ground well off the pace, swung out near the quarter pole and lacked the
needed rally. PLATINUM FROLIC sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace in the two path and retreated through the lane.
