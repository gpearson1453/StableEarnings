Footnotes
TAKE IT OFF away sharply, remained forwardly placed, sparred for control from path two on near even terms with CASHMERE QUEEN, got cued stepping
onto the head of the stretch, responded, kicking well clear of the nemesis during the ensuing furlong, was still comfortably in front when switched over to a
late hand drive. MAGNIFICENT MAGS took up position along the inside route after brushing with MADAME ROSE in the shadow of the starting gate,
improved position during the run around the bend, was maneuvered into the three path during the opening stages of the stretch run, proved no match
rallying for the place. JORDY CAN TAP came out of the gate approximately a half length the tardiest after sustained contact with GRAM'S GAL, was down
towards the rail by the conclusion of the backstretch, swung out three wide stepping onto the top of the lane, closed in sufficiently enough to be along for the
show. AFTER THE WIRE placed along the inside, narrowed in on the ones to catch beginning from the midway point on the turn, fanned out into path five
for clearance from upper to midstretch, rallied to finish a non-threatening fourth. CASHMERE QUEEN vied for command with the winner while saving
ground, pulling a bit on the bit during the initial stages, kept at the task until upper stretch then backed away. MADAME ROSE brushed with the second
place finisher after losing her footing springing from the gate, was guided over to the inside, cut the corner into the lane, failed to fire appreciably. DON'T
CRY ANNA three wide onto the turn, got sent out into the four path exiting it, folded. GRAM'S GAL tucked into the path two after bumping with another at
the start, began a steady retreat after entering the turn.

Footnotes
BONUS BABY dueled three then two wide with UNDETECTABLE to her inside, shook off that rival past the five-sixteenths and got set down spinning two to
three wide into upper stretch, then drew clear under a drive to prevail. FUNNY BONES FLAG veered in at the start forcing GHOSTGHOSTGHOST to steady
off her heels and bumping UNDETECTABLE, chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and kept on to secure the place honors. DANCING KIKI chased along the inside coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch, weakened while along for the show honors. GHOSTGHOSTGHOST got steadied off
the heels of FUNNY BONES FLAG when that rival veered inwards and conceded four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased five then
four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung six wide into upper stretch and improved position. UNDETECTABLE bumped at the start by the
veering in FUNNY BONES FLAG, dueled from the two path with BONUS BABY to her outside, tucked to the rail half a mile from home, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, got shaken off inside the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. TINY MAGOO two to three wide in pursuit down the
backstretch, came under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside for home and tired. MIA CALIA lunged at the start,
chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn, swung four to five wide for home and made no impact.

Footnotes
SUMMER BOURBON one of the quickest out of the starting gate, retained its prominent position, got guided into the two path path, proceeded along well
rated disputing the pace, went about the task from between rivals beginning from the general area of the five-sixteenths marker, was on the verge of
assuming control when switched over to stronger handling a furlong down the road, did indeed emerge as the one to catch at the eighth pole, was under
attack by WINNING DRIVE from that juncture onward, dug in with determination to preserve the score. WINNING DRIVE at a considerable distance from off
the rail throughout, stalked the front runners from path four on the turn, was still in it when called upon for more in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole,
having vied as the widest of a threesome starting an eighth earlier, dueled with winner the entire final furlong, got staved off. TALE OF MIST took up
residence in midpack, travelled three wide on the turn, angled out five wide for the drive, gained ground in a steadfast manner en route for the show. SAN
JUAN DIEGO well held keeping watch on the pace from path two until the end of the bend, paused in hand awaiting options heading for the quarter pole,
slithered out towards path four early during the stretch drive, made no headway. HOORAY FOR HARVEY off without apparent mishap, was parked out four
to five wide on the turn, got sent out towards path seven from upper to midlane, venturing onward as the widest of all, rallied mildly securing a minor slice of
the purse. HURRICANE DANCER pursued the pace from path two, was under a drive spinning into the lane, lacked the necessary response. STUDIO B
tracked the pace from along the inside route, under some hand urging seemingly from the get-go, tipped out into path three at the top of the lane, backed
away. WE SHOULD TALK grabbed the advantage shortly after the field had been released, shifted over to the inside route, was forced to fend off the
confidently-ridden winner to his outside, saw the second place finisher add himself to the pace scenario as the half was being rattled off, got set down a few
jumps later, relinquished, was still weakening steadily when expertly and rapidly taken in hand by the pilot after taking bad steps beyond the sixteenth pole,
managed to get pulled up soon afterwards and was subsequently vanned off. COACH VILLA three wide at the top of the turn, got spotted in path five at the
top of the lane to no avail.

near the three-sixteenths, drew clear under a light drive, dug in under growing threat late and held clear to the finish. AFLEETING GLANCE three then two
wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, closed well through to the finish
to be along well clear of the rest and second best. MISTY TASTE hustled from the gate, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, weakened in the stretch while along well clear for the show honors. CENTRAL CAPITAL chased along the
inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired. QUEEN DAVEIGH chased four wide coaxed along from midway on
the turn, went seven wide into upper stretch, passed tired rivals. ROMA CARPE chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. MENZAMENZ established the front and showed the way in hand
just off the inside under pressure from MISS MOON PIE to the outside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
yielded the front near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch and faltered. CELESTIAL DREAM five paths off the inside down the backstretch,

LOST IN ROME away well, spun onto the clubhouse bend three wide, worked its way into the role of primary pursuer and tucked one path closer to the rail
prior to stepping onto the backstretch, was rated along pressing the issue, got called upon challenging in earnest heading home, found himself as the middle
participant of a threesome contending for the top deep into the furlong grounds, vied with vigour to the end and got the job done. ADVANCE NOTICE
remained stationed along the rail after establishing the top, showed the way, tailed by the eventual winner positioned out in the two path, ventured onward
teamed up with the opponent on near even terms, got cued up coming up to the quarter pole, stubbornly clutched to the narrowest of leads, had
BEACHWALKER burst upon the scene by the furlong marker, fought fiercely to the end, but wound up denied. BEACHWALKER pursued the pace from the
two path, between rivals for much of the initial three-quarters, angled out into the path four for the drive home, closed the gap on the ones to catch, latching
up to the them by midstretch, battled hard as the outermost of three the rest of the way to the wire, ultimately had to settle for the show. OUR COUNTRY
forwardly placed three wide on both turns, increased his presence after the third fraction had been finalized, was under encouragement spinning onto the
head of the stretch, weakened late. DANGEROUS EDGE pursued the pace from path two, was maneuvered onto the inside route at the half mile pole, cut
the corner into the stretch, failed to fire. TRI SAINT LORENZO two wide early, travelled towards the three path on the far turn, commenced the stretch one
wider, made no headway. BLOOD MOON darted over to the rail, rode it until the end of the second bend, swung out five wide for the drive, lacked the
necessary response. ROAD TO MEATH off approximately a half beat the slowest after lunging out at the start, got guided over to the rail, went about it
appearing unsettled early, came under the whip leaving the three-eighths pole, went into the stretch and faltered. TITAN'S WILL hung out four wide on both
bends, folded.

Footnotes
TENDERFOOT sparred for the top lightly hand urged in the two path, wrested away control as three-quarters was being completed, settled in upper stretch
and was given his cue, took charge and scampered away. OBSESSED along the inside, argued for the lead matched up with the winner, came under a
drive at the five-sixteenths marker only to get displaced on the front end nevertheless, got left farther and farther by TENDERFOOT, salvaged second.
AASR rode the rail for three-quarters, got driven towards the path four for entrance into the stretch, straightened away and was outkicked. VILLAINOUS
tracked the pace from along the inside, under a ride on the turn, tipped out into the two path at the head of the stretch, had no rally. TWELTH MAN shied a
bit VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD after brushing with the left side of the start, travelled two to three wide on the turn, got asked for more in the general area of the
five-sixteenths pole, swung out into the four path heading home, gave way. SKIPIN ON ORCHARD mostly two wide in pursuit of the front runners, cut the
corner into the stretch, made no headway. VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD corrected after breaking to the outside, chased the pace three wide on the turn, was
slightly wider down the stretch backing away. EDGE OF FIRE strung out four wide on the turn, appeared through after going a half, strolled into the lane and
was allowed to fade away while protected.

Footnotes
CAPO KANE established the front and settled into a comfortable rhythm showing the way in hand from the two path under the watchful eye of SWILL to the
outside, came under pressure from that rival in earnest midway on the turn, remained patiently handled as a pair of rivals latched on, swung three to four
wide into upper stretch and was set down straightened away, drew off under a drive shying out under a near sided stick inside the eighth pole before being
corrected and prevailed well clear at the end. EAGLE ORB four to five paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked three to four wide through
the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced to stack outside the top pair swinging five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top
one while running on to secure the place honors. HOLD THE SALSA chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off
the inside for home, improved position by tired rivals. SWILL prompted the leader from the outside four then three wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide for home and weakened. ORIGINAL chased along the inside, came under light coaxing three furlongs from home, swung
three wide at the top of the stretch, tired, and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
STEP TO THE BANK gained command shortly after the field had been sent off and running, cut over to the inside route, getting there by the conclusion of
the backstretch, drew out a commanding advantage during the run around the bend, was allowed to glide three wide into the stretch, struck the
three-sixteenths pole and was turned loose, squandered a good portion of a healthy lead during the final furlong but held sway. APEX PREDATOR brushed
at the start, went on to pursue the winner three wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, closed the gap but to no avail,
managed to save second. HAVE A HEART took up position in midpack after making light contact with another in the shadow of the starting gate, departed
the backstretch approximately three wide, angled five wide for the drive, chipped away the deficit, fell short of snagging away the place. ALITE pursued the
pace four wide on the bend, was being roused spinning into the lane, lacked the needed punch. DUTCHMEN FOREVER strung out three to four wide on the
turn, got sent out into path six from upper to midstretch, rallied mildly, but all done without much impact. TALESPIN brushed with its next stall neighbor after
stumbling at the start, cut over to the inside and went on to save ground until the end of the bend, got worked into path four during the stretch run, closed in,
mostly improving. PAYNT THE EDGES three wide onto the turn, was about as wide heading onto the top of the lane, had no offering. LADY'S BOY was
sent over towards the inside after being brushed at the start, was more in the two path entering the stretch, flattened out in the final furlong. FIVESTAR
BANDIT spotted along the inside at the half mile pole, failed to apply any pressure on the loose-on-the-lead winner. MOONSHINE MAKER two wide
entering the turn, shifted out four wide exiting it, couldn't muster up a kick. SAL MY PAL along the outside, raced three wide on the turn, went about five
wide into the stretch, tired. DEVILISH MOOD taken hold after coming in with his initial step, raced mostly two wide, never got involved. MIGHTY WIND
stalked the top one from afar in the two path, folded after going a half. SIMBASALLTROUBLE quickly spotted along the rail, was never heard from.
