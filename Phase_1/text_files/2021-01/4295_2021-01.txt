PURDUE cleared rivals at the start and went to rail, maintained clear lead into the turn and continued to extend lead into the stretch, responded to urging
and drew off in the final sixteenth. SENSORREY off awkwardly and rank early, lugged out early on the backside and had to be corrected, entered turn
chasing clear leader along the inside, kept on in the stretch while unable to match strides with drawing off winner, held off closing rivals for second. AVALON
RIDE off slow and lacked speed early, saved ground and stayed along the inside, stayed along the rail into the turn and entered stretch in the two path,
responded strongly to urging and finished well splitting foes to get up for third, galloped out with strong energy. LUV IS ALL U NEED broke clean, had to
steady early when rival came out, recovered to stalked leaders along the inside, entered turn two wide, entered stretch in the three path and edged late. MY
PROJECT GIRL tracked leaders along the inside, continued along the rail through the turn, entered stretch in the two path and lacked needed response to
threaten for a better placing.DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCITON, RACE WAS HAND TIMED

thru early in the stretch, responded to strong drive and got up at wire. TERRIBLE TED led in between on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, entered
stretch in the two path, responded gamely and held advantage into deep stretch and nailed by rival along the inside at the wire. PROUDTOBESICILIAN
pressed leader three wide on the backstretch, entered turn three wide, entered stretch in the four path, in range of leader in the stretch, flattened out late
and held third. HARPER'S GEM hopped, off slow at the start, stalked pace in between rivals on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, entered stretch in
the five path, kept on in the stretch and edged out for fourth. PETER ALAN pressed pace along the inside, entered turn along the inside, unable to match
strides with leader in the stretch and gave way in deep stretch. TIGER ON YOUR SIX stalked leaders three wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide
and into the stretch in the two path, lacked bid in the stretch.
