Footnotes
GREGS POSSE chased the pace two to three wide while under urging around the turn, produced a bid for the lead passing the furlong pole after the leader
drifted out, and surged clear through the late stages. MUDSLIDE WICKED broke multiple paths inward, but was clear of inner foes when doing so, prompted
the pace setter two wide, forged an advantage from her turning for home, but bore out many paths in upper stretch, got headed by the eventual winner
passing the furlong marker, but held place from ANONYMOUS SOURCE late. ANONYMOUS SOURCE was last away without incident, lied far off of the
pace in the three path around the turn swung five wide in upper stretch, and rallied through the lane, but failed to catch MUDSLIDE WICKED for place.
PRINCESS MERIDA lied far off of the pace in the two to three path around the turn, shifted in while commencing a rally in midstretch, and improved along
the rail through the final furlong. MAMA LONGLEGS set the pace along the inside, but gave way in midstretch. TALEGA DINERO stalked along the inside,
shifted two wide turning for home, but only managed to chased the leaders home before being outfinished for minor rewards. ILL WILL tracked from
midpack three to four wide around the turn, but only managed to chased leading foes home before fading. MYSTIC MOON saved ground while off of the
pace, but lacked a rally. FINA lied off of the pace two wide, and never got involved.

Footnotes
HARD GAME prompted the pace three wide down the backstretch, took over two wide near the seven-sixteenths pole, drew clear around the turn and
widened under steady left-handed urging. V. I. P. WHO lacked early speed, moved up three wide under a drive around the turn, continued on the left lead in
the lane and was clearly second best. NAVAJO CREED raced off the pace inside, tipped out near the quarter pole and lacked a rally. GEOMETRICO failed
to menace while racing four wide. SILVER DOLLAR CITY set the pace along the rail and was through after a half. NONA RAC had early speed two wide,
stopped and was eased.

Footnotes
BLACK HOPE stalked along the inside while tracking from midpack, advanced inside of rivals around the turn before bidding for the lead two wide and
between horses at the quarter pole, then kicked clear under driving pressure in upper stretch. FIRST HOMESTEAD got loose pre-race, then prompted the
pace two wide, failed to keep pace with an inner bidding rival passing the quarter pole, then held place while hanging on his left lead. THE REIGN MAN
lagged behind the field in the two path around the turn, commenced a rally turning for home, bumped YES FOR LESS while aiming for a foe-splitting bid for
place, but hung for that position through the late stages and failed to catch an outer rival. YES FOR LESS saved ground far off of the pace, got bumped by
THE REIGN MAN while getting outkicked by that foe at the furlong pole, then stayed on to surpass tiring foes for a minor share. COOL DIXIE MAN set the
pace along the inside, but was headed by the eventual winner at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened on his left lead through the lane. CHILL HAZE
pressed three wide around the turn, but weakened passing the quarter pole. PRICEY VICTORY lied forwardly placed four wide, but came under urging to
keep pace around the turn, and weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
KENTUCKY PHAROAH set the pace two wide around the first turn, cleared midway around that bend, rated on a clear lead inside to upper stretch,
responded readily when roused at the top of the lane and drew off under moderate urging. FIGHTING FORCE led early, settled back inside when the winner
proved intent on the lead entering the first turn, angled out nearing the far turn, bid three wide nearing the lane, could not match strides with the winner but
stayed on willingly for the place. CAVE HILL settled off the pace while racing two wide, inched closer around the far turn, never threatened the winner but
was along for the show. LAUDA SPEED prompted the pace three wide into the first turn, stalked two wide down the backstretch and around the far turn and
weakened in the lane. IT'S A GAMBLE went evenly inside. OMAHA CITY steadied at the start and trailed while racing three wide around the first turn and
two wide around the far turn.

Footnotes
COMPETITIVE SPEED tracked from midpack three wide and outside of foes, inched close turning for home to make a menacing bid outside of SHOP GIRL
at the quarter pole, forged an advantage from that foe passing the three sixteenths pole, and drove clear through the final furlong. SHOP GIRL set the pace
along the inside, but was headed by the eventual winner passing the three sixteenths pole, fought on through midstrech, but was only second best. GONE
TO CABO stalked along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch, hung on her left lead through the lane while vying for show
inside of a pair of rivals, and just prevailed over those foes for that position. HIT THE WOAH was off a step slowly causing her to be bounced around
between rivals at the start, tracked in hand while off of the pace in the two path around the turn, shifted three wide while failing to keep pace with the leaders
turning for home, vied outside of a pair of rivals for show through the lane, but hung for that position. DIAL TO WIN prompted the pace two wide, but was
outkicked by an outer bidding foe approaching the quarter pole, then vied for show between rivals while weakening through the lane, and was outfinished by
them for a minor share. LUCIFERS LAIR chased two wide early on, but faltered passing the half mile pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
RIJEKA (IRE) settled well back inside for a mile, circled five wide around the far turn, closed down the center of the track, leaned in near the sixteenth pole,
was quickly corrected, regained momentum and was up in the final strides. KING OF SPADES raced three wide in midpack early, advanced three deep
around the far turn, angled further out in upper stretch, closed outside, took the lead in deep stretch but was tagged by the winner in the final jumps.
THEREGOESJOJO was in range inside early, angled three wide late on the first turn, tracked the pace three deep from there, bid nearing the lane, dueled
outside of GOOD OLE BOY through most of the stretch, prevailed in that battle but was caught late. GOOD OLD BOY stalked the early pace two wide, took
the lead early on the far turn, dueled inside of THEREGOESJOJO to deep stretch and was outfinished. MORNING STRIDE saved ground off the pace,
made good progress between foes around the far turn, bid nearing the eighth pole but flattened out inside of the top finishers. PRINCE OF ARABIA raced
off the pace two wide, made progress four deep rounding the far turn, rallied between foes in upper stretch, was on heels near the sixteenth pole and had no
further bids. DUROCHER saved ground in midpack, was shuffled back at the rail rounding the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and lacked a closing bid.
SOUPER JAGUAR set a clear pace inside under a hard hold and tired around the far turn. TROUBLE COFFEE made a big four wide middle move and
retreated around the far turn.

Footnotes
DRAIN THE CLOCK prompted WARRIOR'S PRIDE through stiff fractions, forged an advantage from that foe at the five sixteenths pole, then kicked clear in
upper stretch and widened under vigorous driving pressure. TIGER stalked the leading duo from the three path, inched closer turning for home, but failed to
keep pace with DRAIN THE CLOCK passing the three sixteenths pole, quickly proved no match for that rival, then stayed on to claim place inside the
furlong pole, and safely held that position to the wire. RUNWAY MAGIC lied far off of the pace three wide and between horses around the turn, came into
the lane in the four path while taking aim on TIGER for place, then stayed on, but failed to reach that rival. NEWYEARSBLOCKPARTY lied off of the pace
along the inside, but failed to factor before improving for a mild share late. WARRIOR'S PRIDE set a testing pace while feeling stern pressure from the
eventual winner, but was headed by that foe passing the five sixteenths pole before weakening a furlong later. HIGHWAY BOUND lied off of the pace two
wide and between horses around the turn, and failed to factor. OCEAN RIDE appeared to brush the inside part of the gate at the start, lied far off of the pace
four wide into the turn, and was outrun.

Footnotes
WINFROMWITHIN quickly cleared and angled in to the set the pace along the rail, dug in inside of FLORIFORM and held firm under a drive. FLORIFORM
tracked the pace two wide, slowly gained through the lane but was unable to get past the winner. CREW DRAGON was rank entering the first turn, raced in
range three wide, moved into a clear third rounding the far turn, could not keep pace with the top two in the lane but held on for the show. EL SOCIO
hopped at the start, checked when a rival veered out soon after, raced well back two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn and improved position
outside in the lane. PLEASE THE PHAROAH failed to menace while racing two wide. AMERICAN GREAT never threatened while racing three and four
wide. AL HILAL saved ground to no avail. TWO PRINCES stalked the pace from the rail and faded after a half. PRAYER BOOK was reluctant to load,
veered out soon after the start, saved ground well back, went five wide around the far turn and lacked a bid. HIGH YIELD KITTEN broke awkwardly,
checked off heels soon after, saved ground played no further factor. LISTOWEL LAD saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and made little
impact. COMMAND CENTRAL chased the pace three and four wide and was through early.

Footnotes
CON LIMA set a moderate pace in hand without feeling much pressure from stalking rivals, showed the way on her own power around the far turn before
shaking free from her chasing foes in upper stretch, widened when roused inside the final furlong, and finished strongly to seal the deal. HONEY PANTS
stalked along the inside early on, but got keen into the first turn, settled into stride while backing off a bit around that bend, tipped two wide into the far turn
before ranging up three wide at the five sixteenths pole, but exchanged bumps with HONEY PANTS in upper stretch, sustained her rally while latched onto
the rival and shifting in, then just reached that foe at the wire to achieve place. DESIGNER READY rated far off of the pace along the inside, advanced while
saving ground turning for home, swung three wide turning for home to split foes, but bumped HONEY PANTS in the process, received a hind-quarter bump
from that foe passing the furlong marker, then battled gamely for place inside of that rival, but was nailed on the wire. I GET IT rated at the rear of the field
two wide, shifted four to five wide turning for home, and stayed on mildly for a minor share. INTHEWINNERSCIRCLE stalked two wide and between horses
around the first turn, shifted down and tracked from the pocket around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, then got
outfinished for minor placings. KARAKATSIE stalked three wide early on, then prompted the pace two wide around the far turn, but was outkicked by outer
rallying foes in upper stretch before giving way through the final furlong. VIKING QUEEN got rank behind a keen foe into the first turn, tracked from midpack
along the inside, but faltered into the far turn and was done early. SWEET PEARL lied off of the pace two wide around the first turn, but faltered into the far
turn and was done early.

Footnotes
MUTASAABEQ bobbled a bit at the break, pressed the pace two wide, put a head in front leaving the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and held
clear under a drive. PAPETU was soundly bumped at the start, made progress widest down the backstretch, gained three wide around the turn, bid outside
of the winner near the quarter pole, continued on willingly outside of that foe through the stretch but could not seriously gain. AWESOME GERRY broke
outwardly and bumped PICKIN' STIME into RAISON D'AIR into PAPETU, sped off to set the pace along the rail under pressured from the winner, was
collared leaving the quarter pole and stayed on well to remain well clear of the rest. PICKIN' TIME was slammed between rivals at the start, raced two wide
in midpack and lacked a rally. ULTIMATE BADGER lagged far back inside, angled out in upper stretch and improved position. BIG THORN raced off the
pace outside, made progress four wide around the far turn then came up empty in the lane. RAISON D'AIR was bumped hard between rivals at the start,
steadied nearing the five-eighths pole, raced three wide and played no further factor. EASY TIME had brief speed two wide. KIGER had some speed three
between foes but was through early.

Footnotes
LIGHT FURY broke a step slowly, saved ground from midpack, tracked behind the leading quartet turning for home, committed to the inside and produced a
rail bid for the lead passing the furlong marker, dueled inside of BLAMELESS through the late stages, and prevailed. BLAMELESS stalked the leading
duelers from along the inside while allowing them to open up around the first turn, shifted off of the rail and stalked from the three path around the far turn,
produced a three wide bid for the lead while between horses turning for home, forged a narrow margin in upper stretch, dueled outside of LIGHT FURY
through the final furlong as TROUBLING MOON rallied alongside, but was bested by the prior on the wire while fending off the latter for place. TROUBLING
MOON lied far off of the pace along the inside, shifted two to five wide passing the three sixteenths grounds, then rallied outside of the leaders in the final
furlong, but missed. GOLDEN DECISION lied forwardly placed two wide around the first turn, then four wide around the far turn, ranged closer turning for
home to bid for the lead at the three sixteenths pole, vied through upper stretch,, but flattened out passing the furlong grounds. GO POKE THE BEAR trailed
along the inside, patently awaited racing room through upper stretch, split foes three wide approaching the sixteenth pole, and stayed on to improve
position. PATRIOT DRIVE saved ground far off of the pace, and failed to threaten. WILLING TO SPEED rated off of the pace two wide and between horses,
but failed to make an impact. MONONGAHELA lied off of the pace in the four to three paths around the turns, then weakened in upper stretch. ARTEMUS
BRIDGE lied far off of the pace two to three wide and failed to factor. STREET COPPER dueled for the lead inside of FIELDER, shook clear from that foe
around the far turn, but was swallowed up by other rivals in midstretch. FIELDER dueled for the lead outside of STREET COPPER, but failed to keep pace
with that foe around the far turn, and further weakened in upper stretch. MEMORABLE tracked from midpack three wide, but weakened four to five wide
around the far turn. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE FINAL TIME WAS HAND-TIMED, NO INTERNAL FRACTIONS ARE AVAILABLE.
