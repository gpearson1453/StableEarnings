PULPIT'S PURRFECT was away alertly and quickly made the lead, was nicely rated on the front end, lead throughout and widened late under steady
urging. SPICE IT UP had good position throughout, could not gain late on the winner but held place. ARCELOR was well placed on the inside and finished
willingly. L. A. STAR never far back, lacked a bid and went evenly. SAY IT SWEETLY raced mid pack and was no threat. I'M FEELING LUCKY settled on
the inside and was no threat. BELLA DUDETTE was no factor. PAR FORE SUM was outrun.
