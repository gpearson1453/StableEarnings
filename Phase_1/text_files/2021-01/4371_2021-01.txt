Footnotes
PERFETTO broke readily, was rated tracking just off the first flight between rivals in the opening stages, angled to the rail entering the turn while being
prompted to advance, came through inside the pacesetter to wrest the advantage midstretch and went clear under firm encouragement. STRIKING HEIR
was urged inside foes disputing the pace in the opening quarter, edged clear on the turn, shifted a bit off the rail racing into upper stretch but proved no
match when confronted by the winner. D'URBAN PARK tracked off the first flight outside foes in the opening stages, raced four wide into the turn and
continued with some interest to improve position late. STEEL SHOT, forwardly placed three wide attending the pace racing into the turn, faded into the
stretch. WAR GIANT, off a bit slowly, was settled outside foes, then raced five wide to the turn and into the stretch while proving no threat.
GETTININTOMISCHIEF, urged between foes prompting the pace to the turn, continued in pursuit to upper stretch and gave way in late stages. MY
DISCRETION angled to the inside in the opening stages tracking off the first flight but faded from contention early. CHARLIES A CHARMER came under
pressure early but lacked a response.

Footnotes
MS. GENUINE, in touch with the first flight three deep between foes in the opening stages, conceded some position to track off the first flight racing to the
turn, shifted three wide nearing upper stretch advancing to challenge, skirmished in that path past midstretch and prevailed narrowly in time under right
handed encouragement. DON'T MAKE ME BEG ducked out a bit at the start, was quickly righted to gain terms with the first flight four wide, shifted inwards
racing into the turn prompting the pace outside a rival, dueled for command between foes past midstretch but was just outkicked. DRILL'S VALENTINE,
urged to the lead along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin, dueled for command inside a rival racing into the turn, then continued grudgingly
inside the top pair to late stages while just failing to contain those rivals. LA WAPA, in touch with the leaders between foes in the opening stages, angled to
the inside tracking off the first flight, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch but drifted wide in late stages. ASTROMELIA settled inside foes in the last
flight racing to the turn and continued evenly into the stretch. MAGDALENA settled between foes and proved no threat. LASTING JOY tracked off the
second flight four wide in early stages and steadily faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
PAPAJUDGY was urged prompting the pace outside a rival to gain a narrow advantage racing through the backstretch, dueled for command inside another
challenger entering the turn, then continued gamely between foes in the closing stages to maintain a narrow advantage under right handed pressure to
prevail. FIRST DEGREE tracked off the second flight in early stages, angled to the rail entering the turn, advanced to bid inside the leaders entering upper
stretch but came up second best. CURTIN'S UP, forwardly placed three wide stalking the leaders on the backstretch, advanced to press the pace outside
the eventual winner racing through the turn to upper stretch but weakened late. SOUR KICKS tracked off the first flight shifting a bit off the inside, continued
outside a rival racing just off the leaders into the turn, shifted three wide entering the lane but had no final kick. CHINOMADITO settled outside foes in early
stages and made an even effort racing five wide to the stretch to improve position to the end. FREE FLAYME, urged inside rivals pressing the pace through
the backstretch into the turn, gave way between foes into upper stretch. PRETTY CHITU was loose prior to the start, tracked off the second flight between
foes and steadily faded into the turn. CHAOS KID proved no factor. BLAME BISHOP trailed.

Footnotes
CLOUD TEN ducked out a bit at the start into the path of ART OF LAW, was rated between rivals just off the second flight racing to the first turn, angled to
the rail after a half, steadily drew on terms inside the pacesetter nearing upper stretch, then wrested the advantage and went clear under firm right handed
pressure to prove best. SHEDANCESFORFATE was rated off the second flight outside foes in early stages, was prompted to advance three deep entering
the far turn, angled nearer the inside racing into upper stretch and edged a rival for the place honors late. ECLECTIC SOUL stalked just off the pacesetter
outside foes in the opening half, was urged to gain the advantage in the three path entering the far turn, held sway on a narrow advantage racing in that
path to upper stretch but yielded in the drive. ART OF LAW, momentarily caught in tight quarters at the start, was reserved while angling to the inside but
never gained contention. GAELIC GOLD, off last, switched outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled five wide racing into the lane but
made no impression. IRISH CHARMER tracked just off the pacesetter near the inside in the opening half but gave way between foes racing into the far turn.
DONTLOSETHATNUMBER, pulling hard against restraint in early stages, dictated the pace racing in the two path to the far turn and gave out entering the
second bend.

PEACEFUL WAY was urged to the lead while shifting well off the rail racing through the backstretch, dictated the pace on a narrow margin outside a rival
into the turn, drifted inwards under pressure resisting a rival's challenge midstretch but was corrected to hold that foe under left handed encouragement.
THE LITTLE KITTY angled inwards to track off the first flight between foes racing into the turn, altered inside the leader to bid for command along the rail
when presented an opening in upper stretch, was momentarily caught in tight quarters leaving midstretch but continued to dispute the issue while being just
outkicked. WHAT A KNOCKOUT, off slowly, tracked off the second flight five wide to the turn, continued to make steady progress in that path to upper
stretch and edged a rival for a share on the wire. BLAZING MISS JOJO, forwardly placed three wide between foes tracking just off the leaders racing into
the turn, angled inwards entering the lane and just missed for a share. LADY CHITU tracked the pacesetter four wide as part of the second flight in the
opening stages, advanced three deep to challenge nearing upper stretch but had no final kick. CHERRY ROCK BRIDGE tracked off the second flight three
wide between foes racing into the turn and continued evenly to late stages. D FLAT WHITE settled between foes and never gained contention. STAR OF
SHANGHAI settled outside foes dropping off the second flight, angled inwards a bit racing into the turn but offered no rally. HIDEY HIDEY proved no factor.
LET'S GO MAYA, off slowly, was guided to the rail early while being prompted in brief pursuit of the pacesetter into the turn but soon emptied out. DANCE
WISE dropped out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF THE LITTLE KITTY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH WHICH WAS DISALLOWED.

SPECIAL PRINCESS was settled inside foes in the last flight racing through the backstretch, shifted out entering the turn, steadily gained momentum while
angling four wide racing into upper stretch and produced a stout rally to collar ADIOS TRIPPI on the wire to finish on even terms in time under pressure. The
latter broke readily, shifted inwards to dictate the pace on a narrow advantage racing a bit off the rail to upper stretch and just maintained the advantage to
the wire under firm encouragement. FEELING MISCHIEF tracked just off the pacesetter three deep in second flight racing to the turn, shifted inwards a bit
entering the lane continued willingly between foes to close the gap nearing the wire. BIG RINGS tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing
to the turn, shifted to the inside entering the lane but weakened late. CHARGE IT ALL tracked the pacesetter inside foes as part of the second flight racing
to the turn, shifted off the rail nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid. MAKE A SCENE settled between foes in the last flight, angled inside on
the turn and proved no threat. MARKETABILITY tracked just off the second flight four wide in the opening three furlongs and steadily faded racing into the
turn.

NOVA RAGS tracked off the first flight outside foes while unhurried in the opening quarter, was prompted to advance five wide racing through the turn,

in
upper
stretch,
then
took
over
from
that

and
went
clear
under
some

handed
pressure.
NEWYEARSBLOCKPARTY was rated just off the first flight racing a bit off the inside in the opening stages, shifted out three deep entering the turn while
being urged to challenge for command between foes, gained a clear advantage between calls racing into upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner's final
bid. FOREMAN broke sharply, angled inwards to prompt the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, dueled inside the top pair while angling to the inside
entering the lane and prevailed for a share. THE DISTRACTOR tracked off the first flight between rivals racing through the backstretch, was urged to lodge
a bid four wide between foes racing through the turn but flattened out nearing midstretch. THEALLIGATORHUNTER was off a step slowly, tracked off the
second flight outside foes to the turn and continued evenly three wide between foes in the closing stages. LITTLE DEMON settled off the second flight early
while shifting a bit off the rail racing to the turn but offered no rally. DISTORTED LIMITS, forced in at the start, settled last along the inside, then angled out
four wide entering the stretch but made no impression. AHIMELECH ducked inwards bumping DISTORTED LIMITS at the start, was quickly righted, then
urged inside a rival disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn and gave way abruptly after a half.

ME AND MR. C tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance outside foes on the far turn, gained the
advantage angling five wide nearing midstretch, shifted out, bumping KENDAMA under some left handed pressure but maintained the advantage to the
wire. The latter was settled outside foes racing to the first turn, swung out six wide entering the lane, moved to challenge for command while being bumped
in late stages and was just outkicked. CASH LOGISTICS sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the second bend,
dueled for command while shifting a bit off the rail racing into upper stretch but continued well enough to prevail for a share. BIRD'S EYE VIEW tracked just
off the pacesetter along the inside, switched out nearing the far turn to press the issue between foes to upper stretch but came up empty leaving midstretch.
BILLY BATTS tracked off the second flight while angling to the inside, bid along the rail in upper stretch but had no final kick. EPIC BROMANCE tracked the
pacesetter outside a rival as part of the second flight, was prompted to lodge a three wide between foes racing into upper stretch but came up empty late.
DAZZLING TRUTHS tracked off the second flight between foes, shifted four wide into the lane but had no final kick. AND WON trailed throughout while
racing wide into the lane. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF KENDAMA LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF ME AND MR C.
FOR INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY. AFTER REVIEWING THE STRETCH
RUN, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED ME AND MR. C FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HIM SECOND.

LUCKY STRIDE settled between foes dropping well off the leaders racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide after a half gathering momentum, was
prompted to advance in that path racing through the far turn, was fanned to the six path advancing four wide into upper stretch but continued with a steady
late response to wrest the advantage and kick clear under firm encouragement. ON THE TOWN, caught four wide racing into the first turn taking a up a
position just off the second flight, was prompted to gain position three deep between foes racing through the far turn, was fanned to the five path while being
urged through close quarters bidding three deep between foes midstretch, couldn't contain the winner but edged a rival for the place honors. ESTILO
TALENTOSO switched out racing to the backstretch tracking off the first flight from just out of striking distance in the opening half, continued with a steady
advance to bid between foes in the four path nearing midstretch but was outkicked by the top pair. NO MERCY PERCY sprinted to the lead, shifted well off
the rail racing through the backstretch, held sway on a clear margin to midstretch and gave out in late stages. ALL GOOD TIMES settled outside foes in the
last flight racing to the backstretch and never mounted a closing bid. AGI'S CAIT, urged to a forward placing prompting the pace to the backstretch, gave
way racing into the far turn. INDEPENDENT MISS angled inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch but faded after a
half. QUEEN OF CAUSE settled inside foes in the last flight and dropped out early.

Footnotes
INDY LYON, pulled his way to the lead leaving the chute while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin to the far turn, repelled a
challenge racing into upper stretch to go well clear midstretch and held HABITUS on a safe margin under firm encouragement. The latter tracked off the
second flight inside foes racing to the first turn, was shuffled back avoiding tight quarters midway through the backstretch, was prompted to split rivals just
off the inside racing through the far turn to upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap. MISSION BRIEF tracked the pace between foes off the
second flight, lost some ground in close quarters on the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into the lane and continued with an effort to prevail for a
share. KING RAMOS hopped at the start, was settled last, swung six wide racing into upper stretch and found his best stride late. BEACH WARRIOR
tracked the pacesetter three deep as part of the second flight, shifted in racing into the far turn to lodge a brief bid between foes nearing upper stretch but
flattened out late. CENTSOFWANDER tracked off the second flight three deep racing to the backstretch while advancing in some traffic, was urged to make
brief progress three wide nearing the far turn but emptied out into the lane. HACHACHA tracked the pacesetter inside foes in second flight to the
backstretch but faded early. BEDAZZLING, caught four wide racing into the first turn tracking off the second flight, continued widest to the far turn and gave
way. TEXAS STORM tracked the pacesetter between foes in the opening stages as part of the second flight, angled to the inside nearing the far turn and
faded in the drive.

Footnotes
WONDER BLONDY was settled last along the inside racing to the first turn, switched outside foes nearing the far turn, circled rivals four wide into upper
stretch, went clear under pressure while shifting inwards midstretch and kept SWEET MOOCHIE at bay under firm left handed encouragement. The latter
was rated off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, angled outside foes nearing upper stretch to advance five wide in the closing stages
but proved only second best. MILEY tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground through the far turn, swung out six wide entering the lane
and continued with an effort to improve position while prevailing for a share. CALYPSO KEY tracked just off the pacesetter outside a rival in second flight to
the backstretch, advanced to press the issue between foes on the far turn but came up empty in the drive. PLAYIN DISCO tracked the pacesetter inside
rivals in second flight, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. BETTERTHENYOURX sped to the lead while angling to the rail,
dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the second bend, dueled for command into upper stretch and gave way. ZANDREA'S tracked off the second flight
three wide between foes, was prompted to advance nearing the lane but finished in hand through the final sixteenths when lacking a path from to which to
advance. MOTHERWELL ducked out at the start, was righted to gain a position outside foes off the second flight, made brief progress three wide between
foes racing into the far turn to lodge a brief bid but came up empty in upper stretch. NINA'S PATIENCE, pulling between foes dropping off the second flight
racing to the backstretch, steadily faded into the far turn. TEGLA dropped out early.
