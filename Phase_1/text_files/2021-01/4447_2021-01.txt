PROMISE THE WORLD bumped with HEARTFUL leaving the starting gate, saved ground around the turn, was caught behind a wall of horses in upper
stretch, swung to the six path near the three sixteenths pole, closed steadily outside horses and took the lead in deep stretch. DARE TO PROMISE stalked
the pace, moved up three deep leaving the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, opened a clear lead and gave way grudgingly. OUR BELLA NICOLE , two
wide on the turn, was under urging leaving the turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. HEARTFUL bumped with the winner
leaving the starting gate, hugged the rail around the turn, weakened, angled out and passed tired horses. CASANOVA QUEEN set a pressured pace along
the inner rail and gave way. SHOOTINFORTHEMOON prompted the pace two wide and gave way.

Footnotes
PAUL'S PLUNDER stumbled at the break, quickly recovered and disputed the pace outside a rival, moved clear around the turn then set a rated pace, came
three wide into the lane, kept on under solid handling and turned away an inside bid from STAY OUT. STAY OUT , brushed at the break, rated close up
between rivals, responded when given her cue past the three sixteenths, threatened inside the winner past the sixteenth marker but wasn't quite good
enough. HAD THE NOTION saved ground, eased back into the turn, angled out in upper stretch, worked between rivals and churned on. CAIRO QUEEN
stalked outside rivals, circled four wide making some headway into the stretch, had dead aim past the three sixteenths but came up empty. ALWAYS
SOMETHING , off the early pace, angled out and moved up some four to five wide heading to the lane, straightened but lacked a finish. LE PETITE
PAPILLON had speed to the inside of the winner, failed to match strides into the turn, remained a stalking presence past the five sixteenths then weakened
through the drive. PAUL'S PLUNDER was disqualified from first and made unplaced per stewards ruling 21-076.

Footnotes
SICK PACK SARA sped to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and eagerly pulled away the final furlong while kept to her business.
ROCKINHIPPIECHICK chased the pace, was well placed three deep entering the stretch, failed to gain on the winner and finished willingly to hold the
place. WRITTENBYTHESTARS , a forward factor three deep around the turn, lacked the necessary late response. APRILNESS saved ground on the turn,
came into the stretch in the two path and weakened. LADY TIZMO hugged the inner rail around the turn and failed to rally. RONOMES , unhurried down the
backstretch, swung to the six path in mid stretch and passed tired ones. LOOKS DON'T LIE , along the inner rail leaving the turn, angled to the four path in
upper stretch and came up empty. SHE'S ALL COURAGE lacked speed, raced along the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor. FILLMORE EAST
dropped back.

Footnotes
ZIGGY MON cleared rivals from the outside after a furlong, dropped in to set a solid pace, met a challenge from BAND ON TOUR leaving the five
sixteenths, responded and shook clear of that one past the three sixteenths, wandered outward but had enough left under a drive. ABUELO PAPS , backed
into the gate, edged up between runners heading towards the half mile marker, tracked mid turn, shifted four wide into the lane and closed gamely to earn
the place. RUSSELDOINGTHINGS , off a bit slow after drifting out, corrected and was taken off the rail while off the pace, came under pressure around the
turn, moved up between runners past mid stretch then kept on well to the inside of ABUELO PAPS. ABSOLVED lost ground four to five wide, made some
headway into the lane, loomed in mid stretch but flattened out. BAND ON TOUR edged up three wide to take aim into the turn, bid outside the winner mid
turn, forced the issue past the three sixteenths, drifted in near mid stretch when failing to match strides and weakened. SHACKLED had speed to the inside
but was shuffled back after about a sixteenth of a mile, saved ground leaving the far turn, angled wide into the stretch but came up empty.
XMASINTHECITY , sent from the gate, forced the early issue between foes, rated back off the winner after a furlong, chased around the turn then faltered.

Footnotes
BIG BOOTS stalked the pace around the turn, was three wide entering the stretch, lugged in when taking the lead approaching the eighth pole and drew off.
TICKER TAPE PARADE lacked speed, raced four deep on the turn and rallied outside horses. FIVE CARD DRAW saved ground on the turn, chased the
pace and flattened out. GLENGAR , fractious behind the starting gate, raced three wide on the turn, worked between horses in the stretch and lacked a
rally. FEDERALE , inside horses around the turn, raced in the two path entering the stretch and came up empty. CAUSE HE'S WESTERN was no factor.
VICTORY GIVEN , steadied lacking room leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and was not a factor. ZITARROSA set the pace in the two path
around the turn, gave way the final furlong and was eased late.

five sixteenths, wrested command into the lane and eagerly widened under a mild hand ride. BESTLA , four wide, steadily progressed into the lane,
straightened away and kept on with good energy to be clear of the rest. NO CHANCE GIVEN stumbled at the break, recovered and rated two wide, angled
four wide to take closer order past the sixteenths, kept on willingly but was best of the rest. RUN LAURA RUN had speed to clear, dropped in to set the
pace, could not fend off the winner nearing the lane, stayed willingly to mid stretch then weakened. THIEF OF DREAMS , bumped and in tight at the break,
raced well back into the turn, chased between runners leaving the far turn and lacked a bid. SIBA , bumped at the start, saved ground leaving the far turn
but failed to threaten. MOSLER'S TOUCH stalked the pace two wide, was under pressure nearing the lane and tired. BOBBINI , bumped and steadied at
the break, raced off the pace while wide and failed to recover. DRAGON LILY flashed speed inside then retreated around the turn.

Footnotes
ALWAYS SUNSHINE bobbled outward at the break, corrected and edged up in hand to stalk three wide, hounded the leader while under confident handling
mid turn, responded when set down soon into the lane, drew alongside in mid stretch, dueled, secured command about a sixteenth out then drove clear.
STROLL SMOKIN took over soon after the break, set the pace towards the rail, handled outside pressure past the five sixteenths, dueled two wide inside
the winner past the three sixteenths, kept up the fight to deep stretch then gave way grudgingly. AWESOME D J , taken to rate while saving ground, eased
out in the drive and finished with good energy. CHARGE TO VICTORY , bumped and forced in by REFORM SCHOOL at the break, regrouped and moved
up towards the rail, had aim under coaxing into the stretch but lacked a serious finish. REFORM SCHOOL bore in at the break, chased three to four wide,
made a slight run past the furlong grounds then flattened out. STILL HAVING FUN saved ground without threatening.

Footnotes
BOSS LIFE raced in mid pack early, was four deep around the turn, closed determinedly outside horses through the stretch and gained the lead
approaching the wire. DISTANT THUNDER accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way grudginly. LIFESPAN , two wide
chasing the pace around the turn, was well positioned in mid stretch, failed to rally and steadied on horses's heels approaching the finish. DAY OF HONOR
, three wide on the turn, floated to the four path entering the stretch and had a mild rally outside rivals. SWEET ASTA , inside horses on the turn, angled out
in upper stretch and weakened. BOSTON BILLY lacked speed, was five deep in upper stretch and lacked a rally. PADAWHIRK , two wide chasing the pace
on the turn, gave way. CHEAT 'EM CHARLIE raced along the inner rail and was not a factor.
