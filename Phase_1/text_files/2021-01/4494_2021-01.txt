Footnotes
TEETOTALER remained forwardly placed after getting away in good order, was towards the middle of the strip disputing the pace as the outmost of three
early, cut over to closer to the rail after the pace contest morphed into an one on one sort once the first fraction had been reeled off, was held in reserve
pressing the issue two to three wide during the run around the bend, poked a head down at the quarter pole to lead the competition into the stretch, took
charge when given her cue a sixteenth down the road and drew off. DUCKPHAT guided onto the inside route, took it for nearly three-quarters, was gradually
worked into path three during the opening stages of the stretch drive, secured second, having posed no threat to the top one however. GALLINA in between
rivals vying for the lead early, fell back into a stalking role, underwent a two wide pursuit of the front runners going about the turn, commenced the stretch
one path farther off the rail, came home well enough to be along for the show. KNOW IT ALL RED argued for command from the inside until the
three-sixteenths pole, gave way. ELEGANT LAOBAN off the inside, departed the backstretch from path three, was maneuvered into the five path from upper
to midlane, backed away. All riders carried an additional two pounds in compliance with a weather-related safety initiative.

Footnotes
KID CHOCOLATE five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, took over
command straightened away and drew clear under a drive to prevail. CURLIN'S KNIGHT broke out at the start brushing QUINTARELLI, briefly tussled with
that rival for command before settling four then three wide in closest aim, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took over narrow and brief
command swinging three then two wide into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to safely
preserve the place honors. I SEE THE STARS five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued five wide for home and kept on to
secure the show honors. KING OF AMERICAN broke outwards brushing the off side stall at the start, then got bumped by LIGHTNING ROB who broke
inwards and in turn bumped FOTIS, chased along the inside from the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into
upper stretch and improved position kicking on belatedly through the stretch. LIGHTNING ROB broke in at the start bumping KING OF AMERICAN into
FOTIS, chased three paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing three furlongs out, swung
five wide into upper stretch and weakened. MR. FIDGET four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and weakened. FOTIS bumped at the start by KING OF AMERICAN due to pressure
from LIGHTNING ROB breaking inwards, chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired.
QUINTARELLI got brushed at the start by CURLIN'S KNIGHT, who broke outwards, tussled briefly with that rival for command while under restraint and
pulled his way to the front regardless, showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under some pressure through the turn, got headed for the front
at the quarter pole and was set down spinning along the inside route into upper stretch, then faltered in the drive. Please note that due to a winter weather
safety initiative all riders carried an additional two pounds.

Footnotes
MAGNETRON disputed the pace towards the two path for the opening three-quarters, came under stronger handling springing from the quarter pole, was
slightly closer to the rail settling in at the top of the lane, drew out to an imposing advantage over the course of the next furlong, lost most of it in the late
stages but arrived home safe. MANDATORY PAYOUT guided over to the rail by the top of the backstretch, tracked the winner without benefit of much
cover, tipped into the two path getting cued up for the drive home, closed in belatedly garnering the place. MINE THE COIN went on to contend for the top
three wide after overcoming some light contact with ECONOMIC POLICY in the shadow of the starting gate, kept up some pressure until late on the bend,
stepped onto the head of the stretch and backed away. TITAN'S WILL proceeded to come away without apparent mishap after breaking open the gate
twice, travelled four to five wide, as the widest of all, on the turn, was about as wide down the stretch earning the last major check. FRIED RICE KING
chased the pace two to three wide, got set down at the five-sixteenths pole just as the top one was extending its advantage, went into the stretch and gave
way. ECONOMIC POLICY lightly bumped at the start, raced three wide on the turn, was one path wider spinning into the lane, fell back, having failed to
contend. All riders carried an additional two pounds in compliance with a weather-related safety initiative.

AMERICAN POWER prompted the leader from the outside four then three wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home on
near even terms, dug in knocking heads and was bumped nearing the eighth pole as PETE'S PLAY CALL came out under a near sided stick, dueled
through to the finish inching away late to prevail gamely on the wire. PETE'S PLAY CALL hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside
under some pressure from the presence of the aforementioned foe to the outside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for
home, dug in head to head coming out under a near sided stick and bumped his main rival nearing the eighth pole, fought on to the finish but was ultimately
bested at the end. SHARE THE RIDE chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the
show honors. DRAFTED chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened
in the late stages. STAN THE MAN chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and trailed. Please note that
due to a winter weather safety initiative all riders carried an additional two pounds.

Footnotes
SHAKER SHACK retained the advantage after out-breaking the competition, cut over towards the inside once sufficiently in the clear, eventually settling
along the right rim of the inside route, sat on hold carving out the splits, accompanied initially by DUTCHESS OF N Y and then from the midpoint point of the
turn onward by the second place finisher, got turned loose entering the stretch, gradually edged away from ESOTICA during the stretch run. ESOTICA
cemented herself into a prominent position along the backstretch, sat perched three wide keeping watch on the winner after departing the backstretch,
increased its presence at the half was being completed, was set down heading home, lugged in after a right side salvo in midstretch, ventured onward with
some willingness after recovering from the miscue, got staved off. SASSY MELISSA chased the winner taking the same route as that opponent on the turn,
angled four wide into the stretch, rallied for the show. GRACEFULLY WILD four wide onto the turn, got sent out into path five for the drive, made no
headway in the last eighth. THE GLENMORE spotted along the rail in rapid drive, was put to a drive in the general area of the five-sixteenths marker, cut the
corner into the lane and gave way. RAINBOW GAL taken in hand after ducking in at the start, proceeded along in a sluggish manner heading for the half
mile pole, shifted over to the rail at that station, was on the move to the outside stepping into the stretch, began the final furlong in the neighborhood of path
six, improved mildly. NEBO two wide to three wide in pursuit of the front runners on the bend, was more the latter coming into the stretch, backed away.
DUTCHESS OF N Y pressed the issue from the two path until the five-sixteenths pole, folded. All riders carried an additional two pounds in compliance with
a weather-related safety initiative.

FAMILY BIZ at a considerable distance from off the rail throughout, was stacked six wide midpoint on the turn, came under a ride spinning five wide onto the
top of the lane, closed in well during the ensuing furlong, maintained the momentum, struck the front end just inside the sixteenth pole and edged clear.
LIMONITE disputed the pace from along the inside route, was the innermost of a three contending for the top from the top of the turn until the vicinity of the
five-sixteenths pole, got let loose for the drive, saw the eventual winner looming up boldly by the eighth pole, got overhauled with slightly under a sixteenth
to go, had no trouble salvaging second. MALIBU PRO three wide onto the turn, was in the same path heading home, went on to secure the show.
HONORABLE SERVICE took up position towards midpack, sat parked out five wide on the turn, got cued up entering the stretch, left the three-sixteenths
pole about a couple of paths nearer the rail than before, made no impact en route to the final significant slice of the purse. AMERICAN LINCOLN sparred for
command from path two, going about the task from between rivals for a good portion of the journey on the turn, faltered. THE SICARII a bit keen leaving the
chute, travelled four wide on the turn, got set down at the five-sixteenths pole, angled towards path six early during the stretch run, failed to fire appreciably.
KUMAR forwardly placed three wide, was the widest of three vying for the top from the half mile pole until around the five-sixteenths pole, stepped into the
stretch, hung around as a prominent factor for a little while longer then backed away. ROAMING UNION hustled along on the chute, saved ground until the
quarter pole, went into the three path entering the stretch, fell back. All riders carried an additional two pounds in compliance with a weather-related safety
initiative.

Footnotes
SEVEN LILIES bumped at the start by SOUTH AFRICA due to pressure from DANEBURY veering out at the break, chased four then three wide from near
the rear, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch, tipped out two paths straightened away and closed well
outside to collar an embattled trio a sixteenth from home, then edged clear to the finish. SOUTH AFRICA got bumped at the start by the veering out
DANEBURY and in turn bumped the aforementioned foe, prompted the pace three then two wide, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, dug in
under a drive latching on the leader a furlong out, got overhauled in tandem with that rival and GOLANI BRIGADE a sixteenth from home, kept on to secure
the place honors. GOLANI BRIGADE chased along the inside, cut the corner into upper stretch and was on pause in behind BRONX BOMBER until that foe
came out to the two path nearing the eighth pole, got roused along the rail and dug in under a drive latched on that leader, got displaced as a trio a sixteenth
out and kept on for the show honors. BRONX BOMBER hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from
SOUTH AFRICA to the outside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, came
out slightly to the two path a furlong from home, dug in under challenge from flanking threats when overtaken by the top one a sixteenth from home, then
weakened through to the finish. DANEBURY veered in at the start bumping SOUTH AFRICA into SEVEN LILIES, chased three then two wide under coaxing
from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened. SCILLY CAY lunged at the start conceding three lengths to the front before settling into
stride, crossed inside to chase along the rail, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.
Please note that due to a winter weather safety initiative all riders carried an additional two pounds.

Footnotes
MYSTIC NIGHT made contact with CLEMENZA after stumbling at the break, settled into stride, departed the backstretch from path three, got called upon in
the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, angled six wide and took off in earnest after the one to catch with good energy, collared MANDATORY inside the
eighth pole and shook clear. CONTINUATION took up position in midpack, raced three wide on the turn, was put to a drive as six furlongs was being reeled
off, swung out a couple paths wider for the drive, rallied for the place. MANDATORY moved over to the rail after establishing the top, came under pressure
from CLEMENZA coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, sputtered three wide onto the top of the lane, with the aforementioned rival following suit
by spinning much wider himself into the stretch, was put to stronger handling, yielded a little beyond the eighth pole, then weakened into the show slot.
AJHAR took the inside route, was called upon for more crossing the midway point of the turn, cut the corner and was outkicked. CLEMENZA bumped with
the winner in the shadow of the gate, assumed a forward position, quickened enough so as to latch on to the pacesetter approaching the half mile pole,
prompted that opponent all throughout the turn from path two, was induced into spinning four wide into the lane by the leader, steadied briefly right around
the three-sixteenths pole reacting to an errant MANDATORY, never regained any interest. JOHNNYPUMP quickly spotted along the rail, took it until the
quarter pole, got steered three wide entering the stretch, lacked the necessary response. BECKENBAUER strung out four wide on the turn, was a bit nearer
to the rail coming into the lane, never got involved. All riders carried an additional two pounds in compliance with a weather-related safety initiative.
