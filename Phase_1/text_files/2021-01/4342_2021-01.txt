Footnotes
DINOSAUR BEN took quick control to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, drew clear into the far turn and widened with
steady encouragement. RAGTIME COWBOY JOE settled off the pace in the four and five paths then started a four wide bid leaving the three eighths pole,
continued close to the quarter pole but dropped back through the far turn and proved no match. GOOFY BOY broke through the gate prior the start and
settled off the pace in the three and four paths, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path but showed little more. ELOQUENCE
became a bit restless in the gate and rated just off the pace toward the inside, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then weakened into the lane.
STEPHANOPOULOS stalked the early pace about the four path, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole but faded from that point. LUCKY PARK
raced off the pace, rounded the second turn about the five path and was distanced after a half mile. THE BOOK OF ROD was steadied on the heels of rivals
through the first turn and saved ground off the pace, but was distanced after the opening half mile.

Footnotes
TAPTAPTAP tapered in to pressure the pace and took the nod past the quarter pole, bore out on the turn while briefly ceding to Swiss Sunrise, but
recovered the edge at the eighth pole, dug in to draw clear mid-stretch and held well with steady handling. SOUL MACHEN chased the pace and angled to
the outside in the vicinity of the three eighths pole, rounded the turn about the seven path, dug in to take second later yards while gaining on the winner, but
ran out of ground. SWISS SUNRISE angled in to set a pressured pace, yielded the advantage past the quarter pole but recovered the edge when the winner
bore out, gave up the nod again at the eighth pole, dropped back inside the sixteenth and flattened stride nearing the wire. PATAZ gave chase, came
through the far turn about the three path then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. EXPECT DRAMA chased the pace inside, raced at the rail on the
turn and showed little more. STRIVE FOR A CURE gave chase off the rail then weakened leaving the turn. A POWERFUL TALE hesitated giving rivals
several lengths advantage from the gate, angled out to give chase, though, never factored.

Footnotes
STONE CRAZED stalked the early pace inside then took the lead past the nine sixteenths pole, raced with the edge through the backstretch, was met at
even terms midway on the far turn, dueled clear in the upper stretch and widened through later yards. LAUREL LAD ducked out to make contact with
Jimmythepaco after the start and closed to the lead nearing the three quarter pole, was met past the nine sixteenths and dueled with a slim disadvantage
from that point, briefly recovered the advantage midway on the far turn, but, dropped back in the upper stretch and flattened stride. BENROY settled off the
pace inside, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, angled three wide into the stretch and finished well. PONTICELLO steadied into the first
turn and raced well reserved from the half mile pole, bid leaving the quarter, raced at the rail on the far turn and finished evenly. ALLOVERBUTTHECRYIN
raced well back and never factored. KID SEVILLE steadied from between horses into the first turn and settled off the pace, gave chase leaving the nine
sixteenths pole then faded past the three eighths. JIMMYTHEPACO became fractious in the gate and was bumped shortly after the start, stalked three wide
the first turn then faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
HOSS KITTEN stalked the pace inside then challenged nearing the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms from that point, rounded the turn at the rail and
raced clear past the eighth pole, then widened under steady encouragement. IN CLASS steadied at the start and raced in the four and five paths the first
turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and dueled at a close disadvantage three wide on the far turn, drifted to the five path approaching the head
of the lane then dug in for second later yards. UNCUT angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure at even terms leaving the three eighths
pole and raced two deep on the far turn, gave up the advantage into the lane then yielded second later yards. RIGHT NOTION settled close off the rail, bid
nearing the five sixteenths, raced in the three path of the far turn and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. ADIOS HILLARY rounded the
opening turn about the four path then stalked into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, though, faded through the far turn.
COURTESY SHUFFLE stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. JEAN
GREY angled to the five path into the first turn and raced outside leaving the turn, showed no response through the backstretch and was not asked the final
quarter mile.

quarter and raced close between horses on the far turn, then nipped from second under the wire. SKYLAR'S TRICK rounded the first turn in the three and
four paths then stalked into the backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and raced at even terms past the five sixteenths, rounded

BLACK STEEL stalked three wide into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole and took the advantage three wide midway on the
far turn, then dug in determinedly to take the nod in the final stride. MORGAN COUNTY rated a slim lead inside and was met at even terms leaving the nine
sixteenths pole, dug in gamely at the rail from that point but was nipped just under the wire. GOLDEN APPEAL rounded the opening turn about the four path
and raced toward the outside into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, continued in the four path of the far turn and finished evenly
for third mid-stretch. NEVER COMPROMISE settled off the pace about the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn
then flattened out inside the sixteenth pole. SILVER TAURUS saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole and raced at
the rail rounding the far turn, eased out leaving the turn and finished well to pass rivals. DOCTOR MCCOY raced outside into the backstretch then picked up
the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the six path and ran evenly down the lane. DEREK'S BOY saved ground off the pace, gave
chase leaving the five sixteenths pole, angled to the five path nearing the head of the lane but flattened stride the final furlong. ZEP raced with the early
pace two deep then took the lead passing the nine sixteenths pole, dueled at even terms and remained a close factor through most of the far turn, but was
caught toward the head of the lane and weakened. CHARITABLE VISIT raced outside into the backstretch and never factored. FIREBIRD rounded the first
turn in the three path and stalked into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths but faded on the far turn.

BROAD STORM rated close off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead three wide nearing the head of the lane,
then widened under steady handling. COMPLETE SURPRISE rated a short lead inside, came under pressure toward the seven sixteenths pole and dug in
to turn back Dazzle Me through the far turn, but was caught approaching the head of the lane and had to settle for second best. C'EST MARDI settled off
the earlier pace in the four and five paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn then dug in to take third inside the sixteenth
pole. DAZZLE ME raced in the four path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and dueled close two deep on the far turn, but
dropped back and weakened into the lane. MOLLY'S GAME raced off the early pace in the four and five paths, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole
but flattened stride in the four path of the far turn. HETTY G. stalked the earlier pace about the three path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths
pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. SECRET CASTLE saved ground off the pace and showed little response through the backstretch.

was carried to the nine path on the far turn toward the top of the lane and finished well; widest. MISS FORESTER settled off the pace the first turn, bid
leaving the three eighths pole and dug in from the top of the stretch to finish evenly near the rail. CATTY KRYS saved ground off the early pace, bid leaving
the three eighths pole and was carried to the six path toward the head of the lane and raced evenly in the stretch. DAMISELA steadied into the first turn then
settled close into the backstretch, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole and raced close to the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then
