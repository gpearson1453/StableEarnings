GOLD INCLUDED tracked the early pace, loomed four wide into the second turn, made a bid on MIDNIGHT GARDEN, dueled with that rival to the wire and
prevailed for the win. MIDNIGHT GARDEN pressed the early pace, went three wide into the second turn, met the bid of the winner, dueled to the wire and
just missed. CLAIRESSENCE was allowed to settle early raced five wide into the second turn and was empty late. SUBTLE RIDE was unhurried early,
raced along the inside and offered no late rally. SONGBIRD EYDIE set a pressured early pace from between rivals into the first turn and was finished early.

Footnotes
FLICKERING LIGHT chased the early pace, went three wide into the turn, made a bid on OIL COLONY, passed that rivals, opened up and held. OIL
COLONY set a pressured early pace, went five wide into the turn, drifted out late, was no match, finished second best. A SHEEN CAT was unhurried early,
advanced between rivals and finished evenly late. VIX HERO forced the early pace, went four wide into the turn, angled in and faded. KEATON tracked
behind the leaders, went five wide into the turn and was empty late. KINSALE WARRIOR was void of speed, circled seven wide through the turn and offered
no late rally. AUTISM WARRIOR was allowed to settle between rivals, drifted out and was finished early. SANTI COME HOME stalked the early pace from
the inside and faded.
