Footnotes
GRATTO SWING attained a prominent position after an abbreviated brisk hand ride, went to spar with BLACK IRISH from path two directly abreast, made it
to the three-sixteenths pole and got called upon for more, offered up the desired response, out-dueling the aforementioned rival during the ensuing furlong
then held late to preserve the decision. ME 'N SAP settled into the pocket after undergoing some contact with ALITE in the shadow of the starting gate, kept
within striking distance of the ongoing pace dispute, was put to a drive a short distance from the quarter pole, got ridden hard towards path three during the
opening half of the stretch run, narrowed in en route for second. TERCERO slow to settle into stride, cut over to the rail approaching the conclusion of the
backstretch, got set down a furlong down the road, tipped into the two path stepping onto the top of the lane, finished well enough to secure the show.
BLACK IRISH bumped with another after bobbling at the start, displayed no lasting ill effects and procured a prominent position, was lightly hand urged
fending off the eventual winner, was put to a drive as the twosome went into the stretch, saw the top one take over soon afterwards by a slim margin, did
battle until the sixteenth marker before weakening. A VOW OF BEAUTY three wide onto the turn, got sent out in the direction of path four exiting it, made no
impact. HAVE A HEART took up position in midpack, travelled four wide on the turn, was worked into path six from upper to midlane, becoming the widest
of all, made no headway. ALITE bumped from both sides right after the field had been sent off and running, got guided over to the inside route, was on hold
waiting behind some front runners beginning from the five-sixteenths pole, got turned loose spinning into the stretch, failed to fire appreciably. FREUDIAN
ANALYST chased the pace from path four, came under stronger handling by the five-sixteenths pole, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail,
had no offering.

Footnotes
FLASHNDYNAMITE chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing
a challenge through the final furlong, collared the leader seventy yards from home and inched away to the finish kept to task. KANSAS KIS chased three to
four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and advancing to take command swinging four to five wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a
drive to the eighth pole, dug in under threat, got caught seventy yards from home and ran on well clear of the rest to be along second best. STAND FOR
THE FLAG brushed the near side stall at the start, came under hustling and chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then four to five wide
through the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened. FOXTAIL dueled from the three path with JENNEMILY to her inside, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole, yielded the front near that station and went three wide for home, then tired in the stretch. JENNEMILY broke through the gate
prior to the start and was reloaded, got coaxed at the start and dueled from the two path with the aforementioned foe to her outside, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered.

REED KAN disputed the pace from along the inside route, pulling on the bit during the initial stages, struck the three-sixteenths pole and was turned loose,
dug in well late to prevail. VICI rode the rail while keeping watch on the winner, waited late on the bend for suitable options, cut the corner into the stretch
with ample clearance along the rail corridor, narrowed in on the one to catch, fell short. HOME RUN MAKER three wide onto the turn, commenced the
stretch one path farther off the rail, made no headway. THE SICARII parked out four wide on the turn, shifted towards path five for better room in upper
stretch, had no closing punch. SHAMROCKED sparred with the winner from path two for a half before giving way.

Footnotes
BABA established the front and showed the way in hand three paths off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home and came under some pressure
through the turn remaining patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive clinging gamely to the lead
through to the finish and held on over a pair on the wire. COAL SHAFT broke in at the start trading a bump with LIGHTFOOT MISS, who broke outwards,
chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, spun two to three
wide for home, dug in under a drive latched on through the final furlong but could not go by and was repelled to the finish. IAINTFRAIDANOGHOST five
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home,
dug in under a drive kicking on belatedly and shied out under a near sided stick nearing the finish to just miss at the end. LIGHTFOOT MISS broke out at
the start trading a bump with COAL SHAFT who broke inwards, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then from the two path
through the turn, went seven wide into upper stretch and improved position. FIRING CAROL brushed the near side stall at the start and was away awkward
conceding three to four lengths to the front, chased two to three wide until tucked inside through the turn, angled five wide for home and offered no rally.
COMMANDANDCONTROL six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs out,
swung six wide at the head of the stretch and offered no response. MUN LUV chased four paths off the inside until tucked along the inside through the turn,
got put to coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened. RHYTHM AND POWER chased just off the inside
growing detached early on when striding a bit a green, tucked inside half a mile from home, went just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
JACKIE MILTON established control shortly after the field had been sent on its way, was coaxed along showing the way, shifted into the two path when put
to a ride spinning into the lane, kept going well enough to hold sway. WICKED TITLE struck the left side of the starting gate after lunging at the start, got
going and took up residence in midpack, travelled two to three wide on the turn, angled four wide for the drive under a drive, closed in to be along for the
place. PENDOLINO took up the chase three wide on the turn, was in the same path heading home, stayed on for the show. GENTLE ANNIE stalked the
pace from path two, got set down crossing the midway point on the turn, stepped into the stretch, got outfinished. TERPEYE made it into the two path prior
to leaving the backstretch, was being roused along in pursuit of the front runners on the turn, moved out into the four path in upper stretch, backed away. LA
NEGRITA saved ground until the quarter pole, went on to wander out towards path seven during the stretch run to no avail. EVAN'S NICE NOW worked out
a tuck along the rail at the top of the turn, was being urged along swinging a bit wider into the stretch, came up empty. ALEXACRAT gathered after breaking
to the outside, travelled two wide on the turn, took a stroll into path five stepping onto the head of the stretch while not being asked for much and was
allowed to fade away.

Footnotes
MAD MUNNYS away without apparent mishap, remained stationed in the two path, disputed the pace from between rivals until the general area of the
five-sixteenths pole, having come under a drive approximately a sixteenth up the road, kicked away during the final stages of the run around the bend, saw
the runner up chip away at the deficit in the final furlong, but held sway. EMPTY TOMB hustled along on the chute after bumping lightly with KUMAR, got set
up in the four path, kept an eye on the front runners fighting it out for the top, swung into the lane under encouragement and took off in earnest after the
ones to catch, gained ground in a steadfast manner to garner the place. ZOOMER on hold while in range of the disputed pace in path two, stepped into the
lane, stayed on for the show. MALIBU PRO made some contact with the second place finisher in the shadow of the starting gate, departed the backstretch
from path four, got moved out one wider for the drive, mustered up a mild response. KUMAR two wide onto the turn, angled four wide exiting it, made no
headway. MONTAUK TRAFFIC dove over towards to the inside after the break, chose the rail as the place to be by the top of the turn, swung out three wide
for the drive, gave way. HIGH VELOCITY guided into the three path, argued as the outermost of a trio until around the five-sixteenths pole, folded.
SHOTSKI along the rail, slugged it out with a pair of opponents from the outside to the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, fell back even though set down at
that station, stepped into the lane and fell back even more readily.

Footnotes
NOCTILUCENT bobbled after the start, raced briefly inside before settling three wide in closest aim of the leader, widened away in tandem with the runner
up through the latter portion of the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
knocking heads through the length of the stretch taking command a sixteenth from home, dug in gamely to the finish to prevail. WHAT'S MY CATEGORY
broke out at the start under hustling and showed the way in hand just off the inside, widened away in concert with the aforementioned foe through the turn,
got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive clinging to the lead until collared at the sixteenth pole, fought on inside to the finish
while well clear of the rest. DREAMPOINT chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took
the inside route into upper stretch and weakened while along clear for the show honors. KIKKERLAND broke a beat slow, chased along the inside, came
under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. DANTE'S
MAP broke out at the start brushing BELLAMY DOLCE, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch
and tired. NINETY NINE GEORGE chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and passed tired foes.
SONIC SPEED three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. BELLAMY DOLCE got
brushed at the start by DANTE'S MAP, who broke outwards, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper
stretch and tired. YOU'VE GOT MALE four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went three wide for home and tired. A HUGE
CHECKPOINT chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and tired. CAPT' REMINGTON chased three wide
growing detached at the tail of the field when sluggish early on, got placed to a protective hold half a mile from home into the turn, got pulled up in the
vicinity of the three-eighths pole and was subsequently vanned off.
