JACK COOL broke sharp and quickly led exiting the chute, unable to clear as GEOCAS STREET pressed along the inside on the backstretch, managed to
clear rival early on the turn and shook free approaching the three sixteenths, entered stretch in the two path, drifted out a couple lanes in the stretch while
clear, and held safely. GEOCAS STREET broke in and bumped CHANTE at the start, pressed leader along the inside on the backstretch, JACK COOL
cleared to rail early on the turn and rider attempted to ease out in the turn but ended up drifting out into the three path, entered stretch in the three path, kept
on well making a mild rally. LOST THE MINISTER chased leaders two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide and continued in the two path in the
stretch, failed to make any headway in the stretch, and finished up evenly while besting rest. JAY BOY stalked leaders along the inside on the backstretch,
continued along the inside through the turn and failed to launch a bid in the stretch. CHANTE bumped at the start and quickly trailed on the backstretch,
continued along the inside throughout and never threatened.
