Footnotes
BELLA D stalked the pace from inside then two wide on the turn, shifted out into the stretch, rallied and got up in the final moments. ROCKIE CAUSEWAY
up close three deep, took aim two wide into the stretch, bid outside the leader and gained command at the eighth pole, led through the final furlong but got
nailed by the winner. SPANISH CHANNEL away quickly from the far outside, set the pace outside a rival, cleared foe around the turn, challenged in upper
stretch, relinquished control at the eighth pole and stayed on well for a clear third. ELGOFRANCO chased between early, three or two wide around the turn
and finished evenly for a minor award. RAYS DARLINKLE off slow and lost path at the start, took the turn three wide, angled out and showed a mild
response to improve position. LITTLE MISS BELLE broke in and bumped rival leaving the gate, tracked four wide to the lane, angled out further and failed to
threaten. VRONSKY ZIPS AWAY in range outside a rival early, traveled four to five wide around the bend and lacked a rally. SUMMER ROSE bumped
leaving the gate, stalked three to four wide to the stretch and never responded when called upon. BADGER GAL settled along the inside, moved into the
two path around the turn and could not rally. VERRY BOSSY chased from inside, angled out leaving the turn and lacked further response. FIERCE KITTY
shifted out and bumped rival at the start, tipped out into the stretch and proved no menace. RAY RAY IS GONE bumped leaving the gate, pressed the pace
from inside and tired.

Footnotes
LULUMARU stalked the speed from inside, waited for an opening through the second turn, shifted out at the three-sixteenths pole, took over inside the
furlong marker and kicked clear under hand urging. DESTINY'S JOURNEY set the pace a bit off the rail or inside to the stretch, challenged by the winner at
the eighth pole and could kick on with that rival in the final furlong. MISS YOU MOM lacked early speed, tucked inside on the first turn, angled out around
the far turn, steered further out in the drive and finished with a late rally. GIRONA closest in pursuit early, bid outside on the second turn, headed rival at the
five-sixteenths pole, could not sustain momentum into the lane and kept on for a minor award. MAJESTIC DIVA stalked four wide to the far turn, bid three
deep around that bend, also flattened out in the stretch and missed a minor award. ALL TEA ALL SHADE settled off the pace, raced two wide on the turns
and tired.

BEST CHANCE tracked widest early then angled to the rail, saved ground around the turn, shifted out upper stretch then got bumped by rival, split foes and
rallied to the front at the eighth pole and kicked clear. RAGER raced along the inside, angled out into the lane then further in the drive, rallied and got up for
the place. BENCH JUDGE traveled near the back of the pack outside a rival, raced two wide then swung out into the stretch, drifted in through the lane and
lacked the needed late kick. JUGGLES chased along the rail into the turn, swung out leaving the bend, bid five wide in upper stretch, drifted to the rail and
faltered late. INVICTATATUS raced near rear of the field, traveled three wide into the turn, two wide into the stretch, angled out in the drive and passed tired
foes. DARK PRINCE chased off the rail, bid alongside the leader at the three-eighths, vied between around the turn, took the lead in upper stretch then
weakened in the furlong grounds. GATE SPEED chased from outside, bid three deep around the turn, drifted in and bumped rival in upper stretch and
weakened. ED GATTY cleared early then crossed over to the rail, met bids around the turn and fought back from inside to the stretch, lost the lead in upper
stretch and faded out of contention.

Footnotes
KENNEBEC stumbled at the start, showed early speed between rivals then dropped back to chase behind the top pair, tipped outside in the lane, rallied
three wide and drove clear. SHORT RIB prompted the pace three deep then outside the leader, dueled around the far turn and down the stretch, was
overtaken at the sixteenth pole and held the place. ROYAL ORB set the pace from inside, dueled with SHORT RIB around the second bend and stretch and
flattened in the final sixteenth. HARD METAL traveled three wide around the first turn, moved to the inside on the backstretch, angled into the two path
around the far turn and failed to rally. PAISANO chased off the inside, three wide into the stretch and weakened. BROKEN FINGER chased five then four
wide around the clubhouse turn, outside a rival on the backstretch, entered the stretch three to four wide and could not rally. FLEET ROY tracked two wide
then moved to the inside, was eased in the stretch and walked off. RUNAWAY KRISTIN tracked the leaders from inside, angled into the two path around the
far turn, eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
WITCH'S VOW sped to the front then crossed over to the inside nearing the first turn, inched away leaving the backstretch, led clear into the drive, urged
left-handed then right-handed in the lane and held safely. COMMANDING CHIEF tucked inside early, moved off the rail on the backstretch, came out on the
second turn, entered the stretch six wide, rallied and was gaining to the wire. MONGOLIAN KINGDOM forced to steady early by the winner, raced between
foes into the backstretch and pressed the pace from outside, chased the leader to the far turn, went two wide into the lane and kept on through the final
furlong to secure the show. MY INDY went three wide around the first turn, traveled in the mid-pack early, came five wide into the lane and produced a mild
rally. CROI MOR altered out into the first turn, came back to the rail around that bend, moved out into the two path then along the rail into the stretch and
finished evenly. INFATUATE off slow to begin, steadied off heels on the first turn, was in tight along the inside just past the three-eighths, steadied at the
five-sixteenths, remained inside to the stretch and improved position. FIRE POLISH traveled two wide around the first bend then angled to the inside,
steadied briefly at the five-sixteenths pole, angled out into the stretch and flattened. SILENT MUSKETIER had early speed and went three deep into the
backstretch, dropped back into a stalking position and faded in the drive. LEME AT EM raced between rivals then two wide, trailed a bit off the rail into the
far turn, angled three wide into the stretch and made no impact. DIRECT LINE forced to check nearing the first turn, settled along the inside, moved out two
to three wide on the backstretch, came three to four wide into the lane and had little left. AFLEETING LIFE went three wide around the first turn, exited the
far turn four to five wide and was never a factor. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH WITCH'S VOW DID CROSS
OVER EARLY BOTHERING DIRECT LINE AND MONGOLIAN KINGDOM NEARING THE FIRST TURN, IT DID NOT COST EITHER RIVAL A CHANCE
AT A BETTER PLACING AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.
