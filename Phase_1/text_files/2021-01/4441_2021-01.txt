TOWN AGENDA no speed to the quarter pole, rallied, lugging in stretch and still went clear. OVER TELL tracked inside to stretch, bid furlong pole but
proved no match for winner. ARTIE'S LADY tracked, dueled two path and gamely held the show spot late. SMOOTHIE raced evenly with nothing left in the
final furlong. VENETIAN DREAM good inside speed to duel to stretch, used up and faltered late. WITH IT WALTER no speed to the stretch, rallied outside
to improve in the drive. IMTHEPRINCE raced evenly, lacking a late response when needed. HAGANS MARKET bumped at the start, chased to turn but
gave way readily. BIG SKY MONTANA was through at the half from outside. ZACROSS dropped back quickly and never a menace. WHAT A BEAST
bumped at the start and, never threatened. ON TEMPLE HIGH never prominent.
