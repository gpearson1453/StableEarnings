Footnotes
ROSE RUNNER set the pace from the inside while dueling then drew clear in the stretch while driving. SUSPECT THE WORST pressed the pace from the
two path and was clearly second best. HANGING LAKE broke through the gate before the start and was bumped at the start then was allowed to settle in
the four path, circled the field and had her best strides late. SHE'S THE BOSS was bumped at the start then stalked the pace from the three path and faded.
BIGJIM'S SILVERGAL stalked the pace from the inside and gave way. ALYS EPISODE was allowed to settle in the three path then steadily advanced on
the outside made a bid on the turn but failed to sustain the bid late. DECADENT DIAMOND was bumped at the start, raced in the middle of the pack from
the three path made a bid on the turn and lacked response. LINDA'S LEGACY broke through gate before the start and was not a factor. ABLE CATCH
broke to the outside and bumped foe then raced in the middle of the pack and gave way. INTERATIFWITHLEU was not a factor.
