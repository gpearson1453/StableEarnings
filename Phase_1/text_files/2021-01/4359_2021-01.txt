LOVE YOUR BUTTONS raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane, rallied down the lane and drove past the leader in the late stages. ARCH
YOU READY chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid three wide in the stretch, was under a long drive, led late but was caught
in the final stages. INHERITTHEWIND chased the pace early, took over command, was off the rail into the lane, under a long drive in the stretch and yielded
in the late stages. DETERMINATOR was well placed early on, shuffled back along the far turn, was in the three path into the lane and came again in the
stretch run. MESA SKYLINE raced back early on, was in the three path into the lane while making a bid but weakened late in the stretch drive. TWINKLING
KNIGHT steadied along the far turn, was in the five path into the lane and improved position down the lane. LIZZY'S LURE raced along the five path into the
lane while making a bid but was empty in the stretch run. GOT THE NOTION tracked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and faded in the stretch.
BIG EXCHANGE was never a threat. HONDO GUSTO was never a factor. RED BLUE AND TRUE set the pace for a half then folded up. PEGASUS ON
THE GO was through after a half.
