I'M SO ADORABLE set a pressured early pace, raced four wide into the turn, opened up in early stretch and drew off as an easy winner. ADRIENNE'S
PROGENY tracked the early pace, went three wide into the turn, angled in, was no match and finished second best. ZIPZAPZOOM chased the early pace,
went five wide into the turn drifted in late and faded. OWEN'S SHOT was unhurried early, raced six wide and never fired. DIXIE CHIP raced in mid pack
early, raced along the inside and weakened. LETHAL ENTITY was void of speed, circled seven wide through the turn and offered no late rally. REDHAWK
was outrun early and was never a factor.

Footnotes
MIRROR IMAGE was allowed to settle early, went six wide through the turn, was closing fast, took control late stretch and surged clear. MASTER RULER
set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, drifted out late and finished second best. LODE THE GOLD tracked the early pace, went four wide
into the turn and was empty late. STOCKED was reserved early, raced along the inside through the stretch and flattened out late. COUGAR COUNTRY was
up close early, raced between rivals and faded. FOXRUN was taken back early, raced six wide through the turn and finished belatedly. J SERINO pressed
the early pace, went three wide into the turn and weakened. AWESOME IMAGE raced in mid pack early, went five wide into the turn and never fired.
ASSETS INCLUDED was void of speed, saved ground into the turn angled out late and offered no late rally. GENTLE PRINCE was unhurried early, went
