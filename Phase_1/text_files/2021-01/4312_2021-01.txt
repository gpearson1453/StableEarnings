Footnotes
GIPSEY SORCERESS angled inside foes leaving the chute while being prompted to terms with the first flight, pressed the issue along the rail racing to the
turn, shifted out once gaining a clear advantage midway through the bend, held sway while shifting about under pressure racing into the lane but maintained
a safe margin under firm encouragement. MEMORABLE ANGEL settled last while shifting off the inside early, gathered momentum nearing the lane to split
foes three wide in upper stretch, then angled to the inside in the closing stages to edge a rival for the place honors. TALE OF V K, in touch with the first flight
three wide between foes prompting the pace, stalked just off the leader in that path into the lane and continued with an even effort while just outkicked for
second. FOOT RUB LOVE joined the pace four wide in early stages, pressed the issue in that path to the turn and gave way after a half. MISS
UNDERSTANDING angled to the inside in the opening stages while settling well off the leaders and failed to menace thereafter. OH DILLY, urged between
foes pressing the pace, continued in pursuit of the eventual winner to the lane and gave way late. RISEN CHANGE tracked off the first flight in the opening
quarter, came under pressure entering the turn while angling inside but quickly came up empty.

Footnotes
NO TIME TO YAWN broke sharply, was urged along the inside setting the pace on a narrow margin, held sway just off the inside to upper stretch and
maintained a safe advantage under firm right encouragement. PRIVATE ASTRAY settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, swung out
to the four path racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap but proved only second best. SUPER SHOES, urged to a forward placing
tracking just outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, continued in pursuit between foes nearing the lane but weakened late. CUP GAME was rated
inside foes tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out nearing the lane but had no closing bid. KALININGRAD angled to the inside
early tracking just off the pacesetter to the far turn and faded into upper stretch. JUST CALL ME HOMER tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to
the backstretch and gave way nearing the lane.

STRIKING CHROME was rated outside foes tracking the leaders from out of striking distance through the backstretch, was prompted to advance in the four
path nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to take over late and go clear under firm handling. SUCCESSFUL LEGACY stalked
just outside the first flight in the opening quarter, advanced to press the issue three wide entering the turn, shifted in slightly leaving midstretch while her
rider took some action to correct her course but was collared by the winner late. DANCING CRANE broke readily, forced the pace outside a rival racing
through the backstretch, dueled for command between foes into the turn, was steadied slightly while being headed midstretch and quickly gave out.
MELANCHOLY BLUES exchanged bumps with SEE ME SEE YOU in the opening stages, settled last racing to the turn, then shifted out to improve position
in late stages. SEE ME SEE YOU exchanged bumps in the opening stages, shifted off the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the turn but came up
empty after a half. RUBY LEE, urged to dispute the pace inside a rival through the backstretch, pressed inside foes into the turn and gave way after a half.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN MIDSTRETCH BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
BLUEYED PRINCESS ducked in at the start, was quickly righted while shifting outside foes in the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled four wide
racing into upper stretch while being prompted to advance, then came around some traffic in the closing stages to prevail narrowly in time under firm left
handed pressure. SHE'S AN ALPHA tracked just off the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced to challenge for command
leaving the far turn, drifted out racing through the stretch impeding TWISTED TREASURE while forcing that rival into the path of IRISH CHARMER leaving
midstretch but continued with interest to save the place honors while just failing to contain the winner. SCHATZI settled well off the leaders while angling to
the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, came through inside foes to challenge when presented an opening midstretch but lacked
the needed late kick. RACHEL'S WISH tracked the pacesetter inside a rival as part of the second flight racing to the far turn, shifted out racing into upper
stretch exchanging some contact with TWISTED TREASURE, was urged to advance between foes while caught in close quarters midstretch and was just
outkicked. TWISTED TREASURE, pulling against restraint in early stages tracking off the second flight between foes, advanced three wide racing into the
stretch while being urged to challenge outside the leaders, exchanged bumps in upper stretch, then was carried out by SHE'S AN ALPHA into the path of
IRISH CHARMER midstretch and had no final response. IRISH CHARMER shied inwards avoiding BLUEYED PRINCESS at the break, tracked off the
second flight inside rivals to the backstretch, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch while being urged to advance between foes, but lost all
momentum when being forced out leaving midstretch. JEANIE VEE, urged to the lead along the inside, set the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn,
dueled inside foes to upper stretch and gave way late. SENORITA AURORA trailed throughout. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDERS OF IRISH
CHARMER AND TWISTED TREASURE EACH LODGED CLAIMS OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF SHE'S AN ALPHA ALLEGING INTERFERENCE
MIDSTRETCH WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
ADMIRAL HOPPER, urged clear outside foes in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin continuing well off the rail into the turn, then
maintained a safe margin while shifting inwards under firm pressure to prove best. WALKS LIKE A LADY tracked the pacesetter racing four wide just off the
second flight racing to the turn, continued in that path making a steady advance to the lane but proved only second best. BEACHSIDE BUNNY tracked the
pacesetter inside foes in second flight racing into the turn and continued evenly into the stretch. OVERT settled well off the field racing to the turn, saved
ground on the turn, then shifted out to split foes entering the lane and continued with a belated response to improve position. BRIGHT AND SHINY switched
to the outside early tracking off the second flight, raced four wide to the stretch and continued evenly. LIL ANNIE ROSE tracked the pacesetter between
foes in second flight on the backstretch but dropped out early. SUMMER HOME, urged three wide between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, gave
way after a half.

Footnotes
ARZAK, carried out at the start, was quickly righted to gain a position tracking off the first flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced on
the leaders three deep entering the far turn, pressed the issue in that path nearing upper stretch and went clear through the lane under firm encouragement.
JOE MAN JOE settled last along the inside, switched outside foes on the far turn gaining position, was fanned five wide into upper stretch but continued with
interest to prevail for the place honors. MAJOR FRONTIER tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, continued under patient
handling awaiting an opening nearing upper stretch, shifted out to split rivals three deep midstretch and continued willingly while just outkicked for second.
NIGHT THINGS was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily gained position inside foes after a half, swung out four
wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance but had no closing bid. FAST DRAW KID, urged along the inside dictating the pace on a
narrow margin to the backstretch, dueled for command inside foes on the far turn and gave way in upper stretch. CASTLE KING settled near the inside
racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. FREELANCE, in touch with the pacesetter prompting the pace in the opening half, pressed the issue
between foes into the far turn to upper stretch and gave way. KICK IT CHARLIE broke out bumping the eventual winner, was collected, then angled to the
inside tracking off the first flight racing to the first turn, shifted off the rail while continuing a bit rank between foes on the backstretch and emptied out early.

Footnotes
CLARIST, broke outwards bumping INDY PRINCESS KOKO, was quickly righted, then urged to the lead along the inside, kicked away to a comfortable
margin entering the turn and held sway to the end under pressure. BILLYSBIRTHDAYGIRL, forwardly placed between foes prompting the pace, proved no
match for the winner midway through the turn but continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. CHATTIN WITH JENNY tracked off the first flight
outside foes racing to the turn, shifted inwards on the bend, then angled three wide in upper stretch while continuing with a steady effort to improve position
while gaining a share. GRANDMARY settled off the second flight along the inside on the backstretch, shifted out on the turn and improved position between
foes near the inside late. INDY PRINCESS KOKO, bumped at the start, tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the turn and continued evenly
three wide between foes in the closing stages. RUN AWESOME TIZ tracked just off the leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight, saved ground to
upper stretch and faded in the drive. BEND THE KNEE, held up avoiding tight quarters in the opening stages, dropped off the second flight racing four wide
into the turn and emptied out nearing the lane. PURPLE PEOPLEEATER tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, faded from contention after
three furlongs while being steadied out of tight quarters entering the turn. LADY MIAH, off slowly, settled outside foes and failed to menace. APOLLO U
ANYWHERE angled in sharply in the opening stages while being urged in brief pursuit three wide into the turn but gave way abruptly after a half.

Footnotes
BRASSY, off slowly, was settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled out six wide entering the stretch and found her best stride
leaving the furlong marker to rally to the front in time despite being bumped to narrowly prevail under firm encouragement. GLOBAL BRAND switched
outside foes leaving the chute dropping off the second flight, was prompted to advance four wide on the far turn, was fanned five wide entering the lane,
steadily advanced to gain a narrow advantage between calls late, shifted out bumping the winner nearing the wire and just failed to contain that rival.
MARY'S FRANCE (FR), a step slow into stride, tracked off the second flight outside rivals in the opening half, was prompted to advance three wide entering
the far turn, was fanned four wide in upper stretch while moving to challenge between foes but was outkicked by the top pair. AZIZA, forwardly placed along
the inside tracking the pacesetter along the rail, continued between foes on the backstretch, shifted to the inside entering the lane to bid for command inside
the leaders midstretch but was outkicked. MY SISTER'S KEEPER, held up just off the leaders shifting to the three path racing into the backstretch, was
urged to challenge between foes in that path nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. OMNIA, urged to a forward placing just outside the leaders racing
to the first turn, shifted inwards prompting the pacesetter on the backstretch, took over while angling nearer to the inside on the far turn, dueled between
foes into the lane but faltered leaving midstretch. RAIN DANCE tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, was prompted to advance
three deep into the lane, raced in close quarters while lacking a path in late stretch and lacked the needed final kick. SYLVANELLA angled to the inside
early tracking off the first flight, steadily faded into the stretch. ZURLIN settled between foes racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. BLUE
MISTRESS, urged to the lead outside a rival, angled to the rail once gaining a clear advantage, set the pace into the backstretch but gave way abruptly
racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
SUSPECT A STORM came through close quarters while being rated just off the second flight in the opening stages, was prompted to advance four wide
between foes on the turn, steadily moved to terms with the leader in that path racing past midstretch, wrested the advantage under brisk handling and was
taken in hand in the final strides to narrowly prevail. UNCLE HAL tracked off the first flight four wide racing to the turn, advanced three deep on the turn to
wrest the advantage in upper stretch, but coudln't fend off the winner while just lasting for the place honors. THE GREAT LOUDINI, bumped at the start,
was off slowly, settled between foes racing to the turn, gathered momentum splitting foes three deep midstretch, then angled inside the leaders to challenge
for command while going well late. FOURTH DESIGN, caught five wide on the backstretch tracking off the second flight, was prompted to advance while
racing five wide on the turn to upper stretch but continued with interest while being just outkicked. STAR JUANCHO, a bit outpaced in early stages, gathered
momentum while angling out six wide in upper stretch and was making belated progress. TALE OF A SONG tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight,
shifted out on the turn, briefly awaited an opening, then was urged to split foes nearing the lane but had no closing bid. CALL ME HANDSOME, urged along
three wide prompting the pace, pressed the issue between foes to upper stretch and gave way. FAR FROM AWESOME dropped out early. EXECUTIVE
DECREE, urged inside rivals prompting the pace racing into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. I'M CARDINAL, urged between foes disputing the pace
on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, gave way after a half. MINES MADE UP, held up dropping out of close quarters in early stages, settled last
and trailed the field to the stretch.

Footnotes
CARIBBEAN KITTEN was settled between foes dropping well off the leaders racing to the backstretch, gained some position three deep between foes on
the far turn, briefly awaited an opening racing into upper stretch, split foes while shifting out four wide racing past midstretch, then rallied to the front and
went clear under firm right handed pressure. SHES DYNOMITE, held up off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance
four wide nearing the lane, was fanned five wide midstretch but continued with interest to edge rival for the place honors while failing to match the winner's
kick. PUGILIST tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, was prompted to advance three wide on the far turn, went clear midstretch
but failed to sustain that momentum. BELLA PIERINA angled to the inside early tracking off the leaders, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch,
came through to challenge along the inside but lacked the needed final kick. UNABRIDGED (IRE) settled last to the backstretch, was fanned six wide
entering the lane and gained some position while making no impression. NOT ORBINARY settled along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted three
wide entering the lane but passed only tiring rivals. LEDECKY settled outside foes racing to the far turn and offered no rally. TANAGER angled to the inside
early tracking the leaders behind the second flight, saved ground to the lane but offered no closing bid. MARIES MELODY broke in bumping SOME SAY
SO, was urged prompting that rival's pace into the backstretch, dueled for command between foes to upper stretch and gave out nearing the furlong marker.
SOME SAY SO, bumped at the start, sped to the lead along the inside racing to the backstretch, dueled inside foes on the far turn and gave way into the
lane.
