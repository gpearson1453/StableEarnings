Footnotes
ZAGRAH (GB) sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, increased her advantage into the lane and was ridden out to the wire.
CROOKHAVEN LASS chased the winner from the inside throughout, was no match for that rival in the drive but held well to save the place. FOGGY
BOTTOM lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady rally. ELEGANT SILK settled off the leaders early, moved
three-wide through the second turn and failed to menace. ICE ANGEL was void of early foot, saved ground through the second turn and did not threaten.
AUTUMN ISABELLA was forwardly placed from the inside, weakened after going a half and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
COASTAL STARLITE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew clear.
REGAL LADY was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside with SOMARA, vied with that rival into deep stretch but could not match strides
with the winner late. GEE STREET lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with good energy. SOMARA
disputed the pace with REGAL LADY while racing three-wide and gave way through the final sixteenth. MERITOCRACY raced off the pacesetters early,
moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further with a furlong to run and did not threaten. LACEY'S RAINBOW was forwardly placed early, moved
four-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive. POPULAR APPEAL lagged throughout.

KLONDIKE CREEK was allowed to settle early, advanced three-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and steadily drew clear. UPO
was hustled along to stalk the pace of KING EDDIE while racing four-wide, was carried out further by that rival approaching the stretch, gained a brief lead
into the lane but could not match strides with the winner late. UNLAWFUL ACT was reserved just off the leaders while racing three-wide, was fanned
five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. TERRYS TOM CAT settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the second turn and
finished evenly in the drive. KING EDDIE sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, drifted out nearing the quarter and gave way in the
drive. SOBERANO (FR) showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the lane and did not offer a bid.

TORPEDO AWAY was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, quickly opened a clear lead and held
sway to the wire. CANNONBALL COMIN lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with good late
energy. OUR BOLD PRINCE disputed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way to the winner after going a half. PERFECT WAGER was forwardly
placed early from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and failed to gain late. TRISTRAM SPEAKER was away alertly to race just off the leaders early,
moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. BARBIERE lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further in
mid-stretch and finished with a belated bid. ABUSIVE GARY was hustled along to duel for the early advantage while racing four-wide, moved five-wide
through the turn and weakened after going a half.

SMILING SPIRIT was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, waited for racing room nearing the quarter, angled out in mid-stretch, reached the fore
soon after and drew off with little need of urging. TRISKAIDEKA was bumped from both sides at the break, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through
the turn, angled in with a furlong to run, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. SWEET AND SOFTLY broke sharply to duel for the lead
from between foes, opened a clear margin into the lane and gave way through the final sixteenth. KATIE'S PARADISE settled off the leaders early, moved
five-wide through the turn, reached a striking position but failed to gain late. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through
the turn, was checked in the final sixteenth and finished willingly. VEGAS PALM lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MAY
SONG was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. HOLY CATHOLIC vied for the lead from the
inside for a half and weakened.

Footnotes
HOLY ZAGS was reserved just off the leaders from between foes, moved inside to offer a bid into the lane and gradually drew clear. NINA EN FUEGO was
carried out through the first turn by SURFACE, dueled for the early advantage with that rival while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by the
winner nearing the three-sixteenths pole, vied with that foe and gave way through the final sixteenth. MAGICAL PATH was never far back, raced three-wide
through the second turn and finished with a steady bid. BRAHMS COMMAND raced four-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders early, moved
five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. RED BUNTING (IRE) showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not
threaten. SURFACE drifted out through the first turn, disputed the pace while racing three-wide for a half, weakened and gave way through the lane. TOO
HOT FOR CURLIN was checked at the start and bumped, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and also gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SATANTA raced unhurried early, advanced five-wide through the turn, angled out approaching the stretch, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and was
going away late. ICE OR FIRE stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid in mid-stretch, gained a brief lead and gave way to the
winner. THUNDER BOAT lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with a steady bid. MISTER
MCLEAN was away in good order to dispute the pace with GLORY CALL while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. STONE GROOVE
lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and did not offer a bid. LEADVILLE settled off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. BOLD ROMAN was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out into the lane and was
not urged in the drive. GLORY CALL was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside with MISTER MCLEAN and weakened after going a half.
