Footnotes
UNDER THE COUVERS sped to the front soon after the start, set the pace along the rail, drew off in upper stretch, remained clear to deep stretch and
lasted under a steady drive. ALADO was fractious in the gate, was bumped between foes at the start, raced well back two wide, angled five wide near the
quarter pole, closed widest and ran out of ground. DEPUTY INDY tracked the pace three wide, moved into second in upper stretch, was slowly gaining on
the winner but was outkicked. AMERICAN MATTERS was bumped at the start, raced in midpack inside down the backstretch, steadied into the turn, angled
out soon after, raced two wide around much of the turn, came four wide into the lane and had a mild rally. ROYAL BIZ stalked the winner from the rail and
was one-paced in the lane. GENERIC JOE (IRE) angled in sharply soon after the start, chased the pace two wide and lacked a rally. UNIMPEACHED was
bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, angled out near the sixteenth marker and never threatened. PARTY OF NO was put in tight soon after the
start, raced well back inside and rallied belatedly. TRINNI SUMMER prompted the winner two wide and tired in the lane. DUEL FUEL was shut off soon after
the start, checked back to last, raced four and five wide and played no further factor. TWELVE O ONE was forced in soon after the start, had the rider lose
an iron and nearly fall off near the half-mile pole, recovered the iron a few strides later, raced wide and made no further impact. NINJA steadied leaving the
half-mile pole was outrun three wide.

Footnotes
KASIM tracked outside HILLBILLY LOGIC from the start, finished determinedly and wore down the leader from outside to win going away. HILLBILLY
LOGIC broke out bumping DASSULT MIRAGE into BELLA FUTURE, set the pace inside, remained clear past the eighth-pole, but could not withstand the
top one. MACH ONE saved ground to the stretch, came out from behind the leaders cutting off DASSULT MIRAGE near the sixteenth-pole, and finished
evenly. MIDNIGHT TEQUILA failed to menace through a ground-saving trip. DASSULT MIRAGE got bumped into BELLA FUTURE by HILLBILLY LOGIC at
the start, raced two then three wide around the turn, and steadied behind MACH ONE in deep stretch. DROPPED ANCHOR was always outrun. BELLA
FUTURE bumped with DASSULT MIRAGE a couple times at the break, raced three to four wide and was finished approaching the stretch. KOLOHE
PRINCE was skittish in the post parade, broke slowly and showed little. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY, MACH ONE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM
THIRD POSITION AND PLACED FIFTH FOR IMPEDING DASSULT MIRAGE IN DEEP STRETCH.

Footnotes
TOP GUN TOMMY pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, seized command near the seven-sixteenths
pole, was immediately confronted by the runner-up making a four wide bid, reached the quarter pole on even terms, edged ahead in upper stretch, briefly
cleared in midstretch and held on to a diminishing margin late. SEAZAN stalked the pace outside, made a four wide bid around the turn, reached even terms
near the quarter pole, was turned back by the winner in upper stretch but kept plugging away outside to narrow the gap late. SOUTHERN PASSAGE raced
off the pace two wide and was along for the show. HERCULES chased the pace two and three wide, drifted wider in upper stretch and came up empty.
CUATE was outrun inside. HYGH I. Q. set the pace along the rail, was collared near the seven-sixteenths pole and retreated.

Footnotes
CURLIN'S CATCH set a pressured pace inside up the backstretch, edged away from pursuers around the turn, came into the stretch in the two-path facing
a challenge from TABOR HALL, and held that rival off under steady pressure. TABOR HALL advanced around the turn three then four wide, had aim
outside CURLIN'S CATCH into the lane, but could not reach that one while clearly second best. LUNAR BLAST saved ground close up for six furlongs, and
lacked a closing response. LEN LO LADY was forced out a bit by DEEMED ESSENTIAL at the start, raced in the two-path and failed to menace. DEEMED
ESSENTIAL broke outward, pressed the pace between horses for six furlongs, and faded. VIVA LA RED stumbled sharply at the start, and was outrun
inside. CAUGHT LOOKING pressed the pace three wide to the turn, and had nothing left approaching the stretch. ALWAYSINMOTION retired early two
wide.

SEARCH RESULTS broke a step slow but quickly moved up inside, went along behind the leaders awaiting room into the turn, moved out four wide for
daylight and responded readily to some taps on the shoulder after a half-mile, reached the front outside FRANKLY MY DEAR in mid stretch, drew clear
rapidly after switching leads outside the sixteenth-pole and was wrapped up from there. FRANKLY MY DEAR pressed the pace outside EMUNAH and
PLATINUM FROLIC, took over approaching the top of the stretch, proved no match for the winner past the furlong marker and ran on clear of the rest.
BORN AGAIN was outsprinted for a half, shifted out four wide coming off the turn, finished willingly but could not reach the top two. EMUNAH vied for the
lead inside PLATINUM FROLIC for a half, could not go with FRANKLY MY DEAR once straightened away for the drive, and faded. BAFFLE 'EM brushed
with PLATINUM FROLIC at the start, moved inside and failed to menace. PLATINUM FROLIC brushed with BAFFLE 'EM at the start, dueled outside
EMUNAH to the end of the turn, and gave way. RED WIND broke outward, and was never close. SHEZA HAPPY GIRL faltered into the lane five wide.

Footnotes
POWERFUL ALLY moved inside with the lead around the first turn, shook off MYSTICAL MOON after six furlongs, and responded to hold off JANUARY
WON through the closing stages. JANUARY WON saved ground in range early, moved out three wide advancing past the quarter-pole, ran on gamely and
was gaining outside the winner late. DOCTOR D J raced two to three wide to the stretch, lacked a solid bid and was up outside MYSTICAL MOON for the
show. MYSTICAL MOON pressed the pace between horses for six furlongs, and weakened turning for home. QUASAR MOON raced two to three wide in
the second flight, and never menaced. TAKEDOWN saved ground to midway on the far turn before moving to the two-path, and made no impact. SURF
SHACK was four wide into the first turn, and never factored. ICONIC entered the backstretch four wide, and was never prominent. STARSHIP ARAMIS
prompted the pace three to four wide, and was through approaching the stretch. MONMOUTH DR tossed his head at the break and came out five lengths or
so behind the next-to-last horse, made up some ground early inside, but dropped far back after six furlongs.

wide between rivals rounding the far turn then was only one-paced in the lane. SHINING THROUGH saved ground well back, made progress two wide
around the far turn and rallied mildly in the lane. MAX'S CAUSEWAY was strung out four wide around the first turn, made progress five wide around the far

WELL DEFINED sprinted clear early inside, dug in when challenged by GLORY OF FLORIDA after six furlongs, and prevailed through a long, hard drive.
GLORY OF FLORIDA brushed the right side of the gate coming out, moved menacingly three wide around the far turn, reached even terms outside WELL
DEFINED through the furlong grounds, but could not get by and was losing ground to the winner late between horses. LIKE YOU prompted the pace outside
WELL DEFINED for nearly six furlongs, moved out to the three-path in the stretch and ran on willingly outside the top two. BLESSED JOURNEY saved
ground to the turn, swung four wide approaching the stretch, and made no headway on the far outside. CREA'S BKLYN LAW lagged well back for six
furlongs, passed tired horses inside through upper stretch and finished evenly. REBELDE pursued the leaders for six furlongs, and tired. ZONIC was
finished early two wide.

Footnotes
ON A TOUR was unhurried while racing two wide early, circled four wide around the far turn, steadily gained outside and was up in the final strides.
MISSION POSSIBLE was bumped between foes at the start, was a bit rank early, raced off the pace three wide, made a quick three wide bid around the far
turn, seized command leaving the eighth pole and led inside of the winner to the final strides. KEITANY stalked the pace two wide around the first turn,
moved up to engage the pacesetter early on the backstretch, dueled two wide to midstretch, switched back the left lead near the sixteenth pole and
weakened a bit. FOXTROT SEVILLE raced off the pace two and three wide, angled wider in upper stretch and ran on for a minor share. CHIPS AND
SALSA was in range inside but lacked a closing bid. MAP EM UP was bumped at the start, sped to the front, set the pace along the rail, dueled to
midstretch and tired. HIGH FASHION saved ground to no avail. BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY was pinched back soon after the start, raced well off the rail and
made little impact. KHOZAN'S SECRET was bumped at the start, had some speed two and three wide and faded after a half.
