Footnotes
TOO BOSS away to the front, prompted the leader from the outside three wide, took over narrow command near the quarter pole and was set down
spinning four wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. DAZZLE TIME chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
angled five wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors in the late stages. KHAFRE bumped lightly at the start by REPO ROCKS who broke
outwards a step, established the front and showed the way in hand from the two path under some pressure from TOO BOSS to the outside, came under
increasing pressure through the turn and was headed for command near the quarter pole, got let out spinning three wide for home, weakened in the late
stages. REPO ROCKS broke out a step at the start bumping KHAFRE lightly, chased three then two wide, got roused swinging four wide into upper stretch
and weakened. WE READY chased three to four wide down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home and came under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, went two to three wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ADHWAA at a considerable distance from off the rail throughout, departed the backstretch from path four, was still in hand flashing interest as the half was
being rattled off, tipped one path farther off the rail and went after the ones to catch in earnest, wrested away the advantage inside the eighth pole and
kicked clear. MIA BEA STAR cut over to the rail holding a narrow advantage on the backstretch, was forced to fend off a pair of opponents to the outside
after stepping onto the turn, got cued up for the drive home, relinquished to the winner with less than a furlong remaining, won the battle with QUASAR for
second. QUASAR settled into the three path after the field had been sent off and running, disputed the pace as the outermost of a trio during the run around
the bend, got set down for the stretch run, missed out on the place. BEHIND THE COUCH argued for control from between rivals while in path two on the
turn, gave way. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH an early pace contestant, dropped back, continued to track the front runners from along the inside route, slipped
out towards path two for entrance into the stretch, backed away. SHE SO NAUGHTY worked out a tuck into the two path at the half mile pole, commenced
the stretch one path farther off the inside, gave out. ANCIENT BROWN hand urged while taking up the chase from path two on the bend, moved out
towards the six path in the lane in retreat.

Footnotes
BOURBONIC chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, rallied to get on near even terms
inside the eighth pole, dug in knocking heads gamely to the finish and was up in the very last jumps to the wire. PROSPECT MOUNTAIN coaxed from the
gate, established the front nearing the six furlong marker and showed the way in hand just off the inside, remained patiently handled through the turn, got
set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat from flanking challengers, knocked heads with the aforementioned foe
gamely to the finish and was nailed in the last strides. RESPECT FOR ALL showed the way early on until headed for command by the aforementioned foe,
settled three wide in closest aim of that rival, got set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on a furlong out, attempted to
come in slightly a sixteenth from home, the rider pausing, then kept on to the finish well clear of the rest for the show honors. MAKE IT IN NY four then three
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired. GHOST STALKER chased four wide under a ride from
the three-eighths, continued four wide for home and tired. DE ONLY SOLUTION coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide under coaxing from
three furlongs out, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
LOTTIE'S MIZZION assumed a forward position, tucked into the two path to press the issue on the turn while being rated along, was still on hold taking
away the advantage as the third fraction was being finalized, was in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker when turned loose, kicked away to lead by a
comfortable margin before being geared down in the final seventy yards. NICKY SCISSORS hustled on the chute to establish the top, cut over to the rail
with the advantage at the top of the turn, showed the way, with the top one applying pressure one path farther off the inside, was put to a drive right around
the five-sixteenths pole, yielded nonetheless, altered course to be outside LOTTIE'S MIZZION at the furlong grounds, dented the margin late after the
aforementioned foe got taken hold of. MEBS WEB sent over into the pocket as the half was being completed, after being two wide prior, was on hold
awaiting options during the last stages of the run around the bend, got driven two wide into the stretch, shifted back onto the inside route a sixteenth later,
got outkicked. CHOOSE HAPPINESS took the inside route for the opening three-quarters, angled three wide entering the turn, mustered up a mild response
to claim the last major check. GRINGOTTS reserved three wide, was worked into path five from upper to midstretch, made no headway. QUEENDOM
settled into midpack, pursued the pace three wide on the turn, was asked to pick it up in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, was steered into path
four during the early leg of the stretch run, flattened out. GAGLIANO brought up the back of the pack, travelled three wide on the turn, finished off six
furlongs, moved outward, eventually wandering into the seven path, had no offering. NOT A PROBLEM sparred for the lead early, folded.

MAGNIFICENT CHROME procured a prominent position, was in the two path by the commencement of the run around the bend, tipped into the three path
at the five-sixteenths pole in preparation for the stretch drive getting placed to a brisk hand ride, swung out four wide and took off after the ones to catch,
hitched up to the runner up at the eighth pole, dueled with that foe the remainder of the trip to the wire, getting up with a few jumps to spare. AMERICAN
GENTLEMAN remained forwardly placed after the start, sparred for command in the two path, well rated for the opening half, saw MAGNIFICENT
CHROME increase his presence as the half was being completed, was coming up to the three-sixteenths pole when finally asked for more, went at it directly
abreast of the winner from the eighth pole onward, wound up denied. UP SEVENTYFOUR tracked the front runners from the pocket, angled three wide into
the lane, altered out into the five path in midstretch, got outfinished. CENTAVO pursued the pace three wide on the turn, was gradually maneuvered into
path six from upper to midlane, narrowed in for the final significant slice of the purse. CHAMBO hand urged on the turn, underwent a ground-saving journey,
had no rally. KENTUCKY KNIGHT three wide on the turn, was moved out into the four path exiting it, gained but all done without any real impact.
JAILBREAKER guided over to the rail at the top of the turn, tipped out into the two path at the head of the stretch, gave way. BLACK 'N TAN stepped onto
the turn from the two path, commenced the stretch one farther off the rail, backed away. YEROSILVERBIZ firmly held contesting the pace from along the
inside for the initial half, shifted towards path two when asked for more spinning into the lane, folded.

wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong, got bumped
by FLEET WARRIOR as that foe came out a sixteenth from home just after he seized command, took narrow command inside that station before being
caught in the final jumps to the wire. FLEET WARRIOR three wide in pursuit in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung
four wide for home, dug in under a drive taking command nearing the sixteenth marker, came out under a near sided stick bumping the aforementioned foe
solidly at that station and was headed for command, then got outfinished in the late going while safe for the show honors. MOONACHIE bumped at the start
by LEAP TO GLORY who broke awkwardly to the outside, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper
stretch, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole, then flattened out in the late stages. LEAP TO GLORY got off to an awkward beginning and bumped with
MOONACHIE, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and improved position by tired foes.
MORGANTOWN coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand just off the inside, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under threat
and relented nearing the sixteenth pole, then weakened in the late stages. HIM SHE KISSES chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths,
took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened.

THANKFUL away in good order, launched herself into the role of primary pursuer with a three wide run on the clubhouse bend, rated well accompanying
MISS MARISSA, tucked one path closer to the rail at the half mile pole, after the nemesis shifted onto the inside route herself at that juncture, got cued up
spinning into the lane, whittled away at the deficit as the twosome dueled away, ground her way to the front end and edged clear. MISS MARISSA retained
the advantage after out-breaking the competition, showed the way towards path two during the initial stages, pulling a bit on the left, got guided onto the
inside route at the top of the far turn, continued to lead the others, feeling the presence of the eventual winner all the while, was on the cusp of entering the
furlong grounds when asked for more, relinquished with approximately a furlong to go, vied on stubbornly but couldn't re-claim the top. UJJAYI sighted
pulling on the bit at the time, took up position in the pocket racing on the first turn, tracked the front runners without benefit of cover until the conclusion of
the backstretch, kept pace on turn two, angled sharply into the three path heading for three-sixteenths pole, inched up, but had to settle for the show.
LUCKY MOVE stayed stationed along the rail after the field had been sent off and running, was let out a notch easing into the two path at the half mile pole,
got asked for more tipping once more to the outside at the five-sixteenths pole, eventually shouldering AM IMPAZIBLE out that path, swung out into path
four for the stretch, lacked the necessary response. AM IMPAZIBLE unhurried early while taking up the chase in the neighborhood of the two path, departed
the backstretch from path three, lost position to LUCKY MOVE as they approached the quarter pole, was worked into path five from upper to midlane, failed
to fire. SMOOTH WITH A KICK reserved two wide, went three wide into the lane, had no offering and backed away.
