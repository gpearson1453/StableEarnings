Footnotes
CRUZ IN THE CASTLE was bumped then jostled leaving the gate but took the lead early on and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure
nearing the seven sixteenths pole, then steadily encouraged to hold on well. CHEESE LOUISE broke awkwardly and made contact with the winner leaving
the gate then stalked that one off the rail, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, but couldn't gain. LADY SPARROW raced in the four path the first
turn then settled off the pace toward the inside, rounded the far turn near the rail and showed little more. LIL PERFECT came through the opening turn
about the three path and showed little response down the backstretch. THREE AFFAIRS was not a factor. NOT FOR GOLD came out to make contact with
Cruz In The Castle leaving the gate then rated close inside, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole but faded approaching the far turn.

Footnotes
BE BE BOP accelerated to the lead approaching the three eighths pole and rated the pace, drew clear toward the quarter pole and was hand urged from the
mid point of the turn, came under a drive entering the stretch but raced in hand the final sixteenth. DON'TMESSWITHBULL led the pack most of the opening
three sixteenths of a mile then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, though, proved no match for the winner. REDOUBTABLE chased the pace
through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the three path, took over third in the upper stretch and finished evenly. ISLAND CADGER chased the
pace toward the inside, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened. MINI BOLT gave chase inside, rounded the turn off the rail and showed little further.
GRECIAN ADMIRAL chased the pack and raced at the rail on the turn; to no avail. STERLING CAESAR chased the pace outside, rounded the turn about
the six path then drifted wider into the stretch.

Footnotes
LADY MACHO settled off the pace in the three and four paths, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead between horses approaching
the five sixteenths, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled to widen. PIMM AND PROPER rounded the first two turns in
the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage on the far turn but had to settle for
second best. JET SETTIN LADY settled off the pace in the two and three paths, raced at the rail on the far turn, bid into the stretch then flattened stride; a
distant third. WEEKEND MADNESS saved ground off the pace, gave chase from the three eighths pole, faded into the far turn and was eased while
appearing to be sore. CROSS KEYS rated the pace off the rail, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught toward the five sixteenths
and gave way at the rail rounding the far turn. DON'T FIGHT rounded the first two turns about the five path, raced toward the outside into the backstretch
and showed little response. PROCIDANA rated just off the early pace in the two and three paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole but faded through the far
turn.

Footnotes
K W CAPTAIN FLINT rated close inside the opening turn then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, had aim in the three path of the far turn, dueled to the
front approaching mid-stretch, raced briefly clear and held on. MOTI steadied between horses into the first turn and raced well off the pace outside leaving
the turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then dueled through the stretch while gaining on the winner.
BANISHMENT saved ground off the early pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths and raced most of the far turn at the rail, angled to the four path leaving the
turn then outfinished in the duel for second while getting up for third later yards. RELENTLESS STRIKE took over and tapered to the inside to rate the pace,
came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dug in to turn back the challenge of Fly E Dubai at the mid point of the far turn, but was caught
nearing mid-stretch and flattened the final sixteenth. BACOLI raced three wide the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole then faded while losing
ground on the far turn. CENT COMM hesitated at the break and raced well back from early contention. SCRAP IRON PHIL rounded the opening turn in the
four path then raced outside into the backstretch, bid only mildly then weakened in the six and seven paths of the far turn. FLY E DUBAI rounded the first
turn in the four path then stalked into the backstretch, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole and raced close to the mid point of the far turn, but bore
out toward the top of the stretch and weakened. CATONSVILLE was not a factor.

Footnotes
MORALITY CLAUSE angled to the inside to rate the pace, was hand urged away from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then widened
under steady stretch encouragement. TILSA stalked the pace off the rail, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole and raced close through the far
turn, but dropped back into the lane and had to settle for second best. JOY FANTASTIC rounded the opening turn about the five path and settled off the
pace into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little more. CASTLE REVIEW rounded the first
turn in the four path and raced well off the pace into the backstretch, bid into the far turn, rounded the turn off the rail then passed some rivals down the
lane. HICKORY MADE raced off the pace in the two and three paths and showed only mild response. Racing with no shoes, CALLINGHERCOLLINS
rounded the opening turn in the two and three paths, then never factored. CHERISH YOUR DREAM saved ground through the first turn and showed little
response past the three eighths pole. COLERAINE was through early. ZAP MAMA was not a factor.

Footnotes
BLAZING BOURBON, a bit reluctant to load, rounded the opening turn about the four path, stalked into the backstretch then bid nearing the three eighths
pole, ran three wide on the far turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and drew away. AFANDI stalked from the rail and challenged leaving the three eighths
pole, contested the turn at a close disadvantage nearest the rail, took the nod past the eighth pole but was caught mid-stretch. LINE OF ROSES settled off
the pace inside the opening turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn, finished well for third and was gaining on the
runner-up. SUDDEN BRILLIANCE rated close saving early ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then
flattened stride. MIDNIGHT BANKER took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving
the three eighths pole and contested the edge two deep on the far turn, was caught inside the eighth pole and weakened. WILD CAPPUCINO raced well off
the pace about the four path the first turn and showed little response. GYPSY GIRL stalked the pace from the two and three paths, picked up the chase
leaving the three eighths pole then weakened off the rail rounding the far turn. RAINBOW RIVER saved ground. ECLIPTICALS VISKI rounded the first turn
in the four path then faded through the backstretch. Per Stewards ruling #11, Rainbow River is disqualified from earnings.
