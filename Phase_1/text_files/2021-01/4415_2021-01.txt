Footnotes
DOGHOUSE stalked the pace to the turn, was fanned four wide but rallied to get on terms in mid stretch then battled determinedly and held off MATTAWA
N THAT barely. MATTAWA N THAT hustled to contest the pace, inched clear two wide on the turn, dug in when collared by the winner and gamely fought
that one to the line. FURLONGIN FOR LUV broke slow and trailed the field two wide to the stretch, eased out then shifted back in and finished willingly.
ENTREZ NOUS attended the pace outside the runnerup, pressed that one three wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly.
AND DO WHEN was chasing widest of all, circled five wide on the turn but weakened in the final furlong. TRAGICALLY HIP pressed the pace from the rail
to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
TANNERS PRIDE hustled to the front, set the pace off the rail to the stretch then responded to steady urging and held. TRUMP UM pressed the winner
three wide to the stretch, could not impact that one but dug in late to save the place. CAJUN BETTOR drifted out nearing the half and crowded FRIDAY'S
AT SHADY, raced two wide on the turn, shifted out in the drive and had a mild late bid. PLAYING THROUGH chased the winner three wide to the stretch,
got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. FRIDAY'S AT SHADY was away a bit slow then steadied when crowded by CAJUN BETTOR nearing the half,
raced five wide on the turn and was not a factor. LITTLE CENTS got outsprinted to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then gave way.

EXTRACTOR was on the pace inside two others, raced off the rail to the stretch, responded when set down for the drive and outfinished YEAR OF THE OX
for the win. YEAR OF THE OX was hustled along to contest the pace, raced four wide to the stretch, stayed on to deep stretch then could not keep up late.
WISE RIVER RAY broke inward, bumped PEQUENO MONTE at the start, got outsprinted, raced four wide to the stretch then failed to switch leads and
could not impact the top two. GEM STATE was also outsprinted to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch and did not threaten. PEQUENO MONTE was
bumped off stride by WISE RIVER RAY at the start, trailed to the stretch then could only pick off rivals. MONSTRODAMOUS was chasing the leaders from
the rail to the stretch then weakened. HOLD ME CLOSE had no speed, was fanned four wide on the turn and was never a threat. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET
hustled to dueled between rivals and three wide then was outrun leaving the quarter pole and tired.

Footnotes
KATE BOSS rated in a good spot to the second turn, moved up four wide, was roused at the quarter pole, rallied to the front, pushed away while drifting
inward then was under hand urging late. BIG DRESS settled for a half mile, was asked three wide on the far turn, could not impact the winner but
outfinished ASPEN AGAIN for second. ASPEN AGAIN dueled to the backstretch then pressed FIERA CANELA three wide to the second turn, got outkicked
in upper stretch and came up empty late. SHE'S EXPENSIVE stumbled at the start and trailed for six furlongs while four wide and could not threaten in the
drive. LADY OF THE HOUSE was outsprinted to the backstretch then settled to to the second turn, was off the rail to the stretch but lacked a closing
response. FIERA CANELA dueled to the backstretch then edged clear and set the pace for six furlongs but tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
SHE'S SO PRETTY never far back to the second turn, was fanned four wide and rallied to the stretch, raced on terms to mid stretch then dug in stubbornly
to best BLUSHING BAY. The latter was four wide to the backstretch, tracked while trailing to the second turn, remained four wide and rallied up to engage
for the lead in mid stretch, dug in gamely but was held off. BORN TO REIGN got outsprinted to the half, raced two wide to the stretch, lacked room behind
rivals at the three sixteenths, checked then was bested once clear. INDIAN DANCER pressed the pace early then dueled three wide on the second turn,
responded to mid stretch but was weakening late. ST. ANNIE'S INDY flashed good speed from the outside to contest the pace, dueled two wide for six
furlongs then was collared in mid stretch and tired. JUSTA POPPIN tracked the pace to the second turn, had to circle five wide to the stretch and also tired.

REV REE was settled for a half mile, rallied two wide to the stretch, pushed between rivals to engage MISS INDEFATIGABLE for the lead leaving mid
stretch then edged clear driving. MISS INDEFATIGABLE pressed the pace to the second turn, rallied three wide, got on terms to the stretch, inched away
briefly but was collared by the winner then just saved the place. CREATIVE ROMANCE stalked the pace for a half mile, circled four wide on the far turn,
responded in the drive but could not get up for second. GRATZIE (GB) had no speed, settled to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch but lacked
the needed late response. LUCKY MS JONES had no speed, trailed for six furlongs then made up ground belatedly. HAL'S BUDDY was outsprinted early,
settled to the second turn, came four wide to the stretch but lacked a closing bid. SIDE EFFECT (GB) was on the pace from the outset, raced off the rail to
the stretch then tired.

Footnotes
TOM'S SURPRISE was outrun to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then eased out for room, rallied and split rivals and pushed to the front. CLEM
LABINE was chasing to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch, rallied when set down and got the nod for second. CONCENSUS dueled outside a rival,
was two wide to the stretch, responded when hooked in mid stretch then was bested late. NOLONGERAHOBBY stalked the leaders three wide to the
stretch, bid to duel in mid stretch then got outfinished in the late stages. SOUND JUDGMENT pressed the leaders two wide to the stretch but weakened in
the final furlong. REGAL BORN hustled to vie for the lead inside a rival, saved ground to the stretch, stayed to mid stretch then was also outkicked. CHICO
BABY was awkward to begin and trailed throughout.
