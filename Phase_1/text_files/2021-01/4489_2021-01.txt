FROST'S SONG bobbled leaving the gate, rallied two wide between horses around the turn and took over before five furlongs. SAILIN STREET showed
speed, moved two wide to a short lead midway on the turn, drew clear entering the stretch and gave way. PAPA TONY advanced between horses early,
raced three wide around the turn, moved closer in early stretch but failed to sustain his bid. OBROTHER ITSYLVIA stayed inside and lacked a closing.
TORRES DEL PAINE opened a short lead soon after the break, stayed close to the inside and tired in the lane. DREAMING OF LOVE stopped.

SUCCESS ducked out into PLACID leaving the gate then was bumped soon after, moved early to duel inside the winner, came well out from the rail on the
turn and finished with good determination. CHANTAJE ducked out into the winner shortly after the break, was unhurried, raced the three path around the
turn and finished willingly outside. PLACID was bumped into ZIA ADELIA leaving the gate, made a run along the rail on the backstretch to gain position then
tired in the lane. WILD N' STORMY bobbled then ducked out leaving the gate, raced the two path and lacked a rally. PICTURE SENSATION stayed outside
and failed to matter. ZIA ADELIA was bumped leaving the gate then was outrun. OH SO JAZZY stopped.

START A FIRE quickly ran clear two wide midway on the final turn and drew off under steady urging. GOOGLE IT improved position two wide on the final
turn then flattened out. HOSTILE WITNESS stayed inside and lacked a rally. SLY WILDCAT made a run two wide between horses on the final turn then
tired. BIFF was outrun. DUE GEMELLI was no factor. DUKE OF HEARTS moved to a clear lead into the first turn, held on into the far turn then stopped.
SMILEY FACE broke slowly, moved up inside early then stopped. HAPPY GUY was outrun.
