and drove past late. DREAM ON BROTHER came in and bothered FORT LEWIS RIVERS at the start, quickly cleared field and opened up on the
backstretch, maintained lead on the turn and into the stretch, kept to task in the lane and collared past the sixteenth. FORT LEWIS RIVERS stumbled and
bumped both sides at the start, tracked leader two wide after recovering, continued two wide and unable to match strides with top two and faded. MO
DINERO broke out and bumped rival at the start, had to steady briefly early, and dropped well back on the backstretch, continued the rest of the journey
without being asked and never involved. OBJECTION, RIDER OF FORT LEWIS RIVERS LODGED OBJECTION ON DREAM ON BROTHER FOR
INTERFERENCE AT THE START, AFTER STEWARDS REVIEW, IT WAS RULED THAT FORT LEWIS CAUSED HIS OWN TROUBLE BY STUMBLING

RAINDANCE RULES chased leader along the inside on the backstretch, had to briefly steady when TWO BILLS went to rail on turn, lost about half a length,
kept on the rest of the turn, took aim in upper stretch, collared rival at the sixteenth and proved best late. TWO BILLS cleared rivals rather easily on the
backstretch, entered turn along the inside, entered stretch clear, collared by outside closing rival at the sixteenth pole and kept on well to hold second.
VASTLY DEEP stalked pace along the inside on the backstretch, entered turn along the inside, launched bid along the rail and finished a willing third.
TIGER ON YOUR SIX hesitated and came out very slow, spotted field five lengths, saved ground on the backstretch and turn, responded to mild urging and
finished up well. P TOWN TITAN stalked pace two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide and never launched a bid in the stretch.
