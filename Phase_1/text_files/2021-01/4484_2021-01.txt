Footnotes
UNION LEADER was away a step slow and trailed the field, swept up five wide on the second turn to inhale the field, pushed away to mid stretch and
widened under steady urging. SOUTHEAST ASIA chased the pace to the second turn, was three wide but was outkicked to mid stretch then made a late
run for the place. INDIAN HEAD NICKLE attended the pace outside a rival, was fanned four wide on the second turn then came up empty in the stretch.
HERDSMAN had no speed, settled to the half, bid four wide on the second turn then was outrun to mid stretch and not a threat. GOOCH EXPRESS was
also chasing the pace two wide for six furlongs then gave way. GOT TOBE AWESOME hustled to contest the pace in the two path for six furlongs then gave
out.

GOVENOR'S PARTY stalked the pace four wide to the half, bid three wide while chasing on the far turn, responded when set down and inched clear
determinedly. BOBBY'S ALIBI set the pace to the second turn, was collared but responded to mid stretch then battled gamely, was outkicked for the win but
got the nod for second. MR. PICKLES pressed BOBBY'S ALIBI to the second turn, moved up to engage that one for the lead three wide to the stretch, dug
in through a long drive then was bested for the winner and outnodded for second. STALKING SHADOW trailed early, settled to the second turn, came two
wide to the stretch then finished willingly but was outkicked. CITY CHAMP was chasing for a half, got fanned four wide while rallying on the second turn then
was also outrun to mid stretch and did not rally.

RACHEL'S LADY had the best speed, set the pace two wide to the stretch, responded when set down and held off HANDCUFFED late. HANDCUFFED
stalked the winner to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then finished willingly but too late. RED BETTE pressed the pace three wide to the stretch then
got oukicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. THE HENRIETTA was chasing early, bid three wide on the turn but was outrun to the stretch and gave way.
SCARLET IRIS had no speed, dropped back while avoiding the loose horse, was four wide to the stretch then was not persevered with in the drive. ISHKA
BAJA chased the pace early from the inside then drifted out nearing the three eighths, clipped heels, stumbled and lost her rider. The stewards conducted
an inquiry into the accident but found no reason to alter the results.

prevail. CROWN KITTEN was chasing to the turn, raced off the rail to the stretch then shifted inward and closed willingly to be a game second.

AMBER LOUISE was outsprinted to the turn, circled four wide and rallied to loom a threat to mid stretch but came up empty late. STARZA was also outrun
to the turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch and lacked a closing response. TAKES A VILLAGE had no speed and was never a threat. E Z STAR

Footnotes
TAKE HER TEMP pressed the pace inside the runnerup, bid two wide while between rivals on the turn, pushed to the front in mid stretch and held driving.
WILDLY DRAMATIC was outside the winner prompting the leader, raced three wide and dueled into the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and
gamely saved second. ALWAYS FOR MONEY was chasing to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch and had a mild late bid. TAMA'S ARCH had no
speed, got fanned four deep on the turn but was making up ground belatedly. KRISTIN'S PICNIC tracked the leaders from t he rail to the stretch then
weakened. CAMELLIA CITY hustled to the lead, set the pace from the rail to mid turn then was collared by both the winner and the runnerup and tired in the
stretch. FRONT BURNER had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch but was never a threat. ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL broke a bit slow then was green and
always outrun.
