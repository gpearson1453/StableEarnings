Footnotes
CRYSTAL COAST set the pace while well in hand, showed the way while feeling mild pressure from UNION PARK GAL (IRE) down the backstretch but
rating comfortably, kicked clear from that foe in upper stretch, and was wrapped up approaching the wire. JEAN V'S LEGACY saved ground off of the pace,
but was blocked and steadied mildly behind horses while trying to find a rail seam in upper stretch, failed to do so and altered four wide passing the furlong
grounds, then rallied to reach place on the wire. SECRETS KEPT stalked along the inside, chased along the rail in upper stretch to forge place passing the
furlong pole, but was nailed for that position on the wire. SISTER IS DEVIL tracked from midpack in the three to two path and among traffic around both
turns, smoothly shifted three wide turning for home, but only produced a mild grind. UNION PARK GAL (IRE) prompted, then vied, for the lead outside of the
eventual winner, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, and tired. IRAZU stalked four to three wide, but came under a drive around the far
turn, and weakened while drifting out turning for home. HERE HERE lied off of the pace two wide, attempted a rally three to four wide around the far turn
before being floated five wide turning for home, and failed to factor. DAUPHINE was off a bit awkwardly, then was slow into stride, trailed the field
throughout, and was outrun.

THIS DUDES NO FOOL pressed CONVERTER from outside, took over in upper stretch and drove clear. CONVERTER set a pressured pace near the
inside, yielded to the winner through the stretch, and held the place. LAST MINUTE DEAL bumped with BONNO couple strides from the gate, moved off the
inside to the three-path around the turn, and finished evenly. BONNO bumped with LAST MINUTE DEAL just after the start, raced two to three wide and did
not menace. ASCENDED was finished early three wide.

Footnotes
HARTLING prompted the pace outside of FLASHING DIAMON, forged an advantage from that foe at the three furlong pole, drew off turning for home,
widened under driving pressure through the lane, then was wrapped up approaching the wire. SASSY JUSTICE stalked along the inside, then two wide
around the turn, bid for place between horses at the quarter pole, then prevailed over GRACE'S DRAMA for that position inside the final furlong while
proving no match for the leader. GRACE'S DRAMA lied forwardly placed two wide, then three wide around the turn, forged place at the quarter pole while
not keeping pace with the leader, then tired and lost that position to an inner rival in the final furlong. ETANA lied far off of the pace in the three path around
the turn, came into the lane five wide, and improved mildly. GRAN ETIQUETA lied far off of the pace along the inside around the turn, then stayed on past a
tiring foe, but failed to menace. ASSUME CONTROL lied off of the pace in the two to four path around the turn, and failed to factor before weakening
through the lane. FLASHING DIAMOND set the pace along the inside, but was headed by the eventual winner at the three furlong pole, and weakened
while being eased turning for home.

Footnotes
MISTER LEONARDO was unhurried for six furlongs, cut the corner coming off the far turn, moved out through an ample opening rallying in upper stretch,
caught GO MIKE late and edged away. UNCLE FUN trailed two to three wide for six furlongs, angled to the far outside for the drive and finished well to get
up for the place. LONG BEACH KID raced three wide taking closer order approaching the stretch, loomed a threat in deep stretch, got bumped late by GO
MIKE and was outfinished for second. GO MIKE vied outside PRESS SNOOZE in the four-path early, took over and moved inside after a half-mile, showed
the way to deep stretch, and drifted out bumping LONG BEACH KID while weakening late. RAULITO saved ground improving position after a half, loomed a
threat along the rail turning for home but could not sustain the rally. MY MAXAMILLION raced two to three wide, and failed to menace. PRESS SNOOZE
had trouble cornering three wide into the first turn and contesting the pace inside GO MIKE, relinquished command up the backstretch, and was finished
after six furlongs. FRACTIONAL TIMES UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
IMAGERY broke outwardly, vied for the lead three wide, then only outside of LIME around the turn, forged an advantage from that foe in upper stretch, then
drew off through the final furlong. LIME led two wide and between horses down the backstretch, cleared an inside foe into the turn, showed the way inside of
the eventual winner around the bend, but was headed by that rival in upper stretch, yielded, flopped back to his left lead approaching the final sixteenth, but
just saved place. IN VAIN tracked from midpack along the inside early on, stalked two wide and between horses around the turn, tipped three wide turning
for home, but only managed to chase the leader home, and missed achieving place late. BREEHAZEL hopped outwards and bumped a foe at the start,
tracked from off of the pace while caught four wide around the turn, then chased the leader through the lane before flattening out late. DRIVING WIND
tracked from midpack three wide and between horses around the turn, but was outkicked by IN VAIN turning for home, shifted five wide in upper stretch,
and faded. SWIRLING WINE vied along the inside, took back to stalk into the turn, but failed to re-bid, and faded. RED WIND broke outwardly, lied off of the
pace five wide into the turn, shifted down to the two path around the bend, but failed to factor thereafter.

SOUP AND SANDWICH bumped lightly with TWICE TOO MANY at the start, showed in front but was content to let PICKING UP PENNIES go on with it
soon after, took over readily outside that one after a half-mile and moved clear, opened up through the furlong grounds staying on his left lead, and was
geared down finally switching leads near the finish. TWICE TOO MANY was jostled lightly between horses at the break, tracked behind the leaders to the
turn inside, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, could not get near the winner but was clearly best of the others. PICKING UP PENNIES bumped
lightly with TWICE TOO MANY coming out, hustled up to grab the early lead inside, could not match strides with SOUP AND SANDWICH after a half, and
faded. UBIQUITOUS bumped with SANDY DUDE at the start, stayed close three then four wide for a half, and could not keep up after that. SANDY DUDE
bumped with UBIQUITOUS at the start, and raced far back inside. TALEOFTWOBROTHERS was outrun two wide.

Footnotes
DR. SHANE stalked along the inside around the first turn, shifted to the two path into the backstretch, inched closer into the far turn, vied around that bend
before forging an advantage turning for home, dug in as foes made bids on both sides in upper stretch, shifted in subtly nearing the final sixteenth, and
gamely fended off his rivals through the late stages. FARLEY tracked from midpack two to three wide around the turns, bid for the lead in upper stretch,
dueled outside of a pair of foes through the lane, but was denied. J P HELLISH set the pace along the inside around the first turn, allowed MAJESTIC LUNA
to take over into the backstretch, stalked that foe from along the inside, shifted two wide turning for home to split foes in upper stretch, shifted to the rail to
bid inside of DR SHANE passing the furlong pole, got put to a bit of tight quarters by that rival approaching the final sixteenth, but did not lose momentum,
and failed to reach even terms late. BASHA saved ground far off of the pace, angled out from behind traffic and altered course from the four to the six path
approaching the furlong pole, then stayed on for a minor share. OUTSHINE lied forwardly placed three to four wide around the turns, came into the lane in
the five path, then failed to factor. EXAMINER lied far off of the pace in the two to three paths around the turns, swung to the seven path turning for home,
and failed to make an impact. PAGLIACCI saved ground off of the pace, and never got involved. MAJESTIC LUNA pressed two wide early on, took over into
the backstretch, showed the way inside of the eventual winner around the far turn before being headed by that foe at the quarter pole, and weakened
through the lane. ESPRESSO CALIENTE hopped at the start and was off poorly, then was outrun throughout. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF J
P HELLISH CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF DR. SHANE FOR INTERFERECE INSIDE THE FINAL FURLONG, BUT THE CLAIM WAS
DISSALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
QUENANE trailed early inside, gained around the turn while gradually shifting out four wide, overpowered GLORY OF FLORIDA from outside in upper
stretch and drove clear while moving back inside. GLORY OF FLORIDA was unhurried early, gained rapidly four wide to take over before completing six
furlongs, could not handle the winner through the furlong grounds and ran on best of the others. LIKE YOU was outrun early inside, came four wide off the
turn and offered a mild response. FORT PECK eyed the early pace dispute three wide, tapped on the brakes getting out-moved by GLORY OF FLORIDA
near the five-sixteenths, and had nothing more. WELL DEFINED vied inside STORM RUNNER early, was under a drive fending that one off midway on the
turn, had no answer for GLORY OF FLORIDA coming to the quarter-pole, and faded through the lane. STORM RUNNER dueled outside WELL DEFINED to
midway on the turn, retreated approaching the stretch, was pulled up near the eighth-pole and walked off.

Footnotes
PAYNTDEMBLUESAWAY dueled for the lead outside of CAT'S ASTRAY, kicked clear of that foe in upper stretch when let out a notch, and drew off under
hand urging through the final furlong. SANITY rated off of the pace along the inside, saved ground and advanced inside of foes to claim show turning for
home, shifted to the two path in midstretch, and surpassed the tiring CAT'S ASTRAY for place approaching the wire. CAT'S ASTRAY dueled for the lead
inside of PAYNTDEMBLUESAWAY, but proved no match for that foe approaching the furlong grounds, tired thereafter, and lost place inside the final
sixteenth. KATIELEIGH stalked along the inside while staying a path off of the inner railing, came under a drive around the turn while failing to keep pace
with the leading duelers, then sustained her chase through the lane, but failed to threaten. KIFFLE lunged subtly and brushed the outer part of the gate, lied
off of the pace while caught three to four wide around the turn, and failed to factor. SWIRLING CANDY stalked in the three path around the turn, but faded
through the lane. GREGS POSSE tossed her head at the start, got rank down the backstretch while far off of the pace along the inside, and was outrun
thereafter.

LAHINCH went along two wide to the stretch, rallied along the rail and was just up inside rivals. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN raced three wide around the turns,
finished gamely and just missed outside rivals. ANOTHER vied early outside TOTONO, sped off to a lengthy lead entering the backstretch, remained clear
into the final furlong, and was overhauled from both flanks nearing the finish. GEARHEAD brushed with DERBY CHAMPAGNE at the start, shifted out four
wide approaching the stretch, finished willingly and was gaining outside the top trio. PRINCE OF ARABIA lagged in the second flight to the stretch, and
improved past tired horses without threatening. TOTONO contested the pace inside ANOTHER going to the first turn, stayed on the chase for six furlongs,
and faded in the stretch. BATTLE OF BLENHEIM was no factor two to three wide. BOW TIE AFFAIR saved ground outrun early, went four wide on the far
turn and made no headway. DERBY CHAMPAGNE brushed with GEARHEAD at the start, saved ground and lacked the needed response. PLAYING
HOOKY dropped back to trail entering the backstretch, and showed little.
