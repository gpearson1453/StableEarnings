Footnotes
JOHNG stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved up in the two path leaving the far turn, bid for the lead in upper stretch, dueled inside GALILEAN
MOON and determinedly prevailed while drifting out late. GALILEAN MOON , three wide both turns, challenged for the lead in upper stretch, his rider
dropped his whip approaching the eighth pole, GALILEAN MOON dueled with the winner and hung. SUPER HOUDINI , four deep mid way down the
backstretch, dropped back leaving the backstretch, remained well off the inner rail around the far turn, failed to menace and passed a tired rival late.
AMERICAN PIPER set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead in upper stretch and weakened in the drive. WAR LIGHT dropped back leaving the
backstretch.

Footnotes
OUR STAR angled out nearing the backstretch then rated kindly three wide, steadily advanced past the five sixteenths, responded when shaken up soon
into the stretch, seized command in mid stretch then eagerly widened under a right handed drive. WOWWHATABRAT moved three wide to command mid
way on the first turn, opened up and set a slower pace, saw her lead diminish while two wide into the lane, could not resist the winner leaving the furlong
grounds, gave way grudgingly and managed to save the place. BOOM BOOM GONE , off the pace while between rivals, raced two wide into the lane,
eased out in the final furlong and offered a mild kick to garner the show. FLOATING BY dropped in early and settled, edged up some past the five eighths,
continued rail progress entering the lane, chased then flattened out in the final furlong. MISDRIVEN lost ground four wide most of the way, was under a ride
into the lane but lacked a solid finish. OWESAYCANYOUSEE had speed, rated off the leader and stalked in the clear past the five eighths, failed to go on
while saving some ground past the three eighths and faltered.

WENDELL FONG stumbled soon after the start when clipping the heels of LAKI, recovered and settled towards the rail, angled out gathering momentum
past the five sixteenths, came five wide into the lane, closed relentlessly under left handed encouragement and forged ahead in the final strides. SHARE
THE RIDE , between rivals early, tracked a dueling trio while in the clear mid turn, moved up three wide between rivals and engaged the leaders into the
stretch, took over past the three sixteenths, dug in when confronted from his outside in deep stretch, fought gamely but just failed to last. LEBDA rated
close, bid outside KARAN'S NOTION and put a head in front leaving the far turn, sparred between foes from the five sixteenths to upper stretch, lost
command inside the three sixteenths then gave way grudgingly. LAKI drifted in soon after the break and had his heels clipped, settled off the pace, raced
two to three wide into the lane but could only muster up a mild response between foes. KARAN'S NOTION was sent hard to gain a clear early advantage,
dropped in to secure the rail, lost the lead leaving the far turn, stayed on and battled to about mid stretch then steadily gave way. ARTHUR'S HOPE tracked
four wide, rushed up to threaten near the three eighths, vied outside rivals to the head of the stretch then faded. PENGUIN POWER vied inside then
steadied back off the leader nearing the half mile pole, dropped back mid turn, continued inside through the drive then lacked some room nearing the wire.

Footnotes
TATTOOED lacked speed, entered the stretch in the two path, angled to the three path in mid stretch, worked between horses, closed inside GALERIO
approaching the wire and was up late. GALERIO chased the early pace, gained a two wide lead leaving the turn, was clear in mid stretch, drifted out inside
the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. CORDMAKER , checked in close quarters between horses near the five eighths pole, worked between foes on the
turn, was fanned to seven path near the eighth pole, flattened out and his rider briefly eased up at the sixteenth pole when appearing to misjudge the finish.
HANALEI'S HOUDINI saved ground around the turn in striking position, remained inside horses in the stretch and lacked the needed rally. HALL PASS
lacked speed, was four deep into the turn, was fanned to the nine path near the eighth pole and passed tired rivals. MY FRIENDS BEER raced along the
inner rail on the turn and failed to be a factor. AIR TOKEN stalked the pace, moved up in the three path leaving the turn, ranged up nicely in mid stretch,
was floated to the five path near the eighth pole and weakened. OXIDE four wide on the turn, raced between horses in the stretch, weakened and was
steadied in traffic near the sixteenth pole. ALWAYSMINING set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead in upper stretch and faltered the final furlong.

Footnotes
HELLO BEAUTIFUL was nudged up between rivals and took over after a sixteenth of a mile, set a rated pace towards the inside, handled outside pressure
around the turn, spurted away soon into the lane, was asked for her best in mid stretch and dug in late to prevail. CLUB CAR settled well back while saving
ground, picked up the pace leaving the three eighths, eased out into the lane, worked between foes near mid stretch and finished strong to bridge the gap.
BRIDLEWOOD CAT , three to four wide early, dropped back some mid turn, circled five wide into the lane and continued with interest while nabbing the
show. ESCAPADE stalked inside, was under asking into the lane and faded. MALIBU MISCHIEF , away alertly, prompted the pace outside the winner, bid
to apply more pressure past the three eighths, vied to the quarter pole then faded in the final furlong. TARAWA , taken to rate, angled four wide nearing the
lane but lacked a bid. NEW YORK GROOVE failed to menace. CAUSE I'M EDGY stalked the early pace three wide then dropped back after a half mile.

Footnotes
STREET LUTE stalked the early pace, advanced in the two path to secure command leaving the turn, was under brisk urging in the drive and drew off.
MISS LESLIE saved ground on the turn, remained near the rail in the stretch, chased the winner through the stretch and was best of the others. BREEZE
OFF THE BAY lacked speed, raced in the three path on the turn, swung to the four path entering the stretch and offered a slight rally. WHISKEY AND RYE
raced in the two path between horses on the turn then failed to rally. IT CAN , four deep leaving the backstretch, angled in on the turn, raced along the inner
rail in the stretch and passed tired foes. PLANE DRUNK , three wide in a forward position on the turn, drifted to the five path leaving the bend and
weakened. TRIP TO FREEDOM sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and gave way on her left lead.
INCOMPARABLE trailed.

Footnotes
KENNY HAD A NOTION came out a bit at the break and bumped with SHACKQUEENKING, straightened and was eager to the lead, secured the rail and
set a rated pace while handling outside pressure, dueled with MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU from the three eighths, lost command soon into the lane, battled
back under left handed rousing to lead past the sixteenth pole, kept on tenaciously and prevailed. MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU prompted the pace outside the
winner, moved to near even terms leaving the three furlong pole, gained a slim lead while battling into the lane, had his rider lose the whip in mid stretch
then continued valiantly to the wire. SHACKQUEENKING , bumped at the break, corrected and tracked the leaders while racing outside NOBODY KNEW,
shifted three wide with dead aim on the top pair into the lane, gave hard chase past the eighth pole but failed to gain. TIZ MANDATE broke a step slow,
settled outside a rival, angled five wide into the lane and closed steadily. ERAWAN rated in range of the embattled leaders, angled four wide to make
progress into the stretch, pursued to mid stretch then faded. NOBODY KNEW stalked inside, was put to coaxing mid turn, failed to kick on in upper stretch
then retreated through the final furlong. SCOTCH ROCK'S saved ground around the turn, was under a ride mid turn but failed to respond. WICKED
PRANKSTER lacked speed, raced four wide past the quarter pole and lacked a kick.

Footnotes
KENTUCKY COOL , unhurried down the backstretch, raced in the two path between horses mid way on the turn, swung out leaving the turn, closed outside
foes, gained the lead near the sixteenth pole then held sway under steady handling. JACK GAVE BACK bumped with NATTY BEAU leaving the starting
gate, hugged the inner rail around the turn, swung to the four path approaching the eighth pole and rallied nicely. ALPHA QUEUE bumped with SO DIALED
IN leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path around the turn, chased the pace and weakened. SO DIALED IN bumped with ALPHA QUEUE leaving the
starting gate, sprinted clear mid way down the backstretch, set the pace along the rail and tired late. SILVER SUN , four deep on the turn, was not a factor.
NATTY BEAU bumped with JACK GAVE BACK leaving the staring gate, saved ground on the turn while chasing the pace and gave way in upper stretch.
GARBAN chased the pace, gave way on the turn and was eased late. ALPHA QUEUE was disqualified from third and made unplaced per stewards ruling-
21-023- carried wrong weight. JACK GAVE BACK was disqualified from second and made unplaced per stewards ruling 21-093- methocarbamol overage.
