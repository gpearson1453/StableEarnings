ORDER FOR PORKY raced along the inner rail under patient handling, eased out to the three path leaving the far turn, closed steadily outside horses and
was up late under steady handling. DINOSAUR BEN , three wide the first turn, advanced in the two path to challenge for the lead near the quarter pole and
lugged in near the eighth pole. ICE RAIN , three wide the first turn, sprinted clear mid way down the backstretch, set the pace along the rail on the far turn,
was challenged entering the stretch and steadied to avoid the heels of DINOSAUR BEN near the eighth pole. UNBEKNOWNST TO ME showed speed on
the first turn then steadily retreated. PEACHY KEEN , angled in early, saved ground on the turns while outrun. WYE MUMBO , four deep the first turn,
chased the pace down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, faltered and was eased the final furlong.Following a stewards' inquiry and an
objection by the rider of ICE RAIN, DINOSAUR BEN was disqualified and placed third.

Footnotes
PIRATE'S PALACE , a bit headstrong while taking command soon after the break, kicked clear and set a rated pace towards the rail, responded when set
down near the three sixteenths and steadily pulled away under a drive. TIPYOURHATTOTHAT broke a step slow then steadied soon after when in close,
angled out and rated three wide, edged up to a stalking spot after a half mile, went after the winner while under coaxing mid way on the final turn, failed to
keep pace leaving the three sixteenths but continued with some interest to be well clear of the rest. SPEECHIN N TEACHIN prompted the pace two wide
outside the winner, came under pressure around the far turn, shifted in and faded. NO IMAGINATION , between rivals early, gave hard chase two wide past
the three eighths, failed to kick on in mid stretch and weakened. KID CAN RUN saved ground and faltered. GOLD FELLOW , under urging from the gate,
dropped far back after a quarter mile, was eased in the drive and walked off.

Footnotes
M. J.'S LADY stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled the turn three wide, gained the lead outside RAN CHAR in upper stretch, was challenged by
IMAGINE VICTORY near the eighth pole, drifted out near the sixteenth pole and drove clear late. IMAGINE VICTORY , inside horses on the turn, swung to
the four path turning for home, advanced outside the winner in mid stretch, drifted out in tandem with that one near the sixteenth pole and hung. TOTALLY
PERFECT saved ground on the turn, angled out for the drive, steadied to avoid the heels of RAN CHAR near the eighth pole and failed to rally.
MALICEINTHEPALACE broke sluggishly, was four deep turning for home and offered a mild move. SO WHO'S BACK , four wide entering the stretch, was
not a factor. WHY NOT YOU was outrun. RAN CHAR set the pace near the rail, lost the lead in upper stretch, swerved out near the eighth pole, dropped
back and returned bleeding. RED HOT KITTEN chased the pace and faltered. An objection by the rider of IMAGINE VICTORY against M.J.'S LADY for
alleged interference in the stretch run was not allowed.

GIRLS LOVE ME angled out early and edged up to stalk three to four wide, bid under urging heading to the lane, poked a head in front past the quarter
pole, dug in when confronted from his inside in mid stretch, dueled under a drive and held firm. AIR TOKEN settled in the clear while not far back, took
closer order in hand mid turn, awaited room near the five sixteenths, challenged between rivals past the three sixteenths, dueled inside the winner through
the final furlong, kept on gamely but could not get past. CANDYGRAMFORMONGO vied outside a rival before going clear near the five eighths, dropped in
some to set the pace, was confronted by the winner leaving the three furlong pole, battled inside rivals to about the three sixteenths, shifted out while
pursuing in the last eighth and faded. ZAYA broke a step slow, raced off the pace and was under pressure leaving the half mile marker, failed to respond
then steadied when bothered near the three sixteenths. INSTIGATED vied inside early on, gave chase around the turn, dropped back leaving the quarter
pole, stumbled then fell near three sixteenths and walked off post race. There was a stewards' inquiry into the stretch run of INSTIGATED. No action was
taken

Footnotes
SOLEA drafted well back while saving ground, continued inside into the lane, leveled off under strong handling leaving the eighth pole, forged to command
with about a sixteenth to go and drew clear. SCARLET TANAGER , between rivals near the half mile marker, circled four wide into the stretch, threatened
near the sixteenth pole then continued willingly to be clear for the place. HOT CHOICE stalked three wide, moved up between runners heading towards the
sixteenth marker but failed to seriously sustain. BODES SUNSET , off the pace four wide, angled wider for the final furlong but lacked a solid finish.
VILLAMOURA advanced inside rivals early on to take command, went clear after a furlong under a light hold, moved out to a long lead mid turn, seemed
home past the three sixteenths, wandered outward and stopped. TOMA saved ground off the pace, eased out into the lane but lacked a kick. LOOKIN FOR
CANDY chased two wide, was under coaxing mid turn and faltered.

JOURNEYTOTHEMOON bobbled at the break, settled in the clear, edged up between runners mid turn, angled out and progressed in hand into the lane,
forged clear after being put to some coaxing past the three sixteenths then drew away under confident handling. TARGE , sluggish from the gate, was taken
wide early on, moved up four to five wide around the turn, churned on willingly and gained the place. TAYLER'S CHROME , four wide stalking the early
pace, was shuffled back out of a tight spot near the three eighths, regrouped to advance off the rail past the three sixteenths, steadied when in a bit close
nearing the sixteenth marker, shifted out and kept on with interest. MALIBU BEAUTY , three to four wide in range, bid outside rivals to take a short lead in
upper stretch, dueled briefly, chased past the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. GUNS BLAZING , pulled early and tracked off the rail, bid between
runners heading towards the lane, dueled past the quarter pole then faded in the final eighth. LOVE IN HER EYES was hard sent leaving the chute to take
command, cleared early and secured the rail, met challenges past the three eighths, stayed on to about the three sixteenths then tired. CHLOE ROSE
prompted the early pace while saving ground, eased back to stalk, came out for the drive, failed to kick on and tired in the final three sixteenths.
