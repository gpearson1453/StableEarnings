IS SHE QUICK dueled on the lead throughout, dug in gamely and prevailed under left handed urging. KETTLE KING was well placed early, rallied in the
stretch three wide and drew close, could not get past the winner but was second best. RANCHERO was never far back, rallied in the stretch on the rail and
finished willingly. MA MOOS WARRIOR dueled on the lead until mid stretch, then weakened late. VOLUME LEADER was bumped and pushed into the gap
at the start by ZERO GIVEN, then was no menace. DEVINE PRIDE checked early leaving the gate while between horses and was no menace. ZERO
GIVEN bore in at the start pushing VOLUME LEADER in the gap and was outrun. The rider of DEVINE PRIDE claimed foul against the rider of KETTLE
KING for interference leaving the gate. After viewing the tape the stewards took no action.

DEO VOLENTE set the early pace, repulsed a bid at the quarter pole, drew clear late under steady urging. MOST SANDISFACTORY was well placed on
the inside, angled out three wide in the stretch, could not challenge the winner late but was second best. EAGLES PALACE pressed early, rallied at the
quarter pole and gained a slight lead, faltered late. PANAMANIAN TEASER raced close up until the top of the stretch, then gave way. BRISKY was off
slowly, raced mid pack and was no threat. GOLD CZAR broke slowly and was no threat. MUTADARRIB allowed to settle, failed to menace. AMERICAN
SOLUTION was no factor. AMR was outrun.

Footnotes
RYOAN pressed early, rallied in the stretch and gained the lead, widened late to win as much the best while being ridden out. BLUSHING BELLA had good
position early three wide, was no match for winner but was up for place. RIBBONITE was off a step slow and rushed up to contention, saved ground and
gained a slight lead at the quarter pole, then faltered late. MONSOON RAIN raced on the inside and was no threat. MONBA NUMBER FIVE allowed to
settle, failed to menace. LAISSEZ FAIRE set the early pace and gave way. HAIL SPRING was outrun. I GOT THE TIME was no factor.
