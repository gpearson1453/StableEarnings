IRISH CAT stalked through the turn drawing even abreast foe in upper stretch extending to edge clear late. WALDORF broke sharply holding daylight
through the turn, hooked from the outside in upper stretch would battle back ceding grudgingly at the end. REWARD THE MIRACLE tracked the pace
through the turn racing evenly to outside the others in the three path. ROBERT'S PRINCE saved ground chasing through the turn weakening along the rail
the final eighth. BALTIMORE COUNTY away slowly was never in contention. JOE CAIN played no factor. SMART BUT FOOLISH was never involved.
EMPTY PRIZE flashed early speed then faded on the turn. ANTEROS chased through the turn then wilted in upper stretch. ULTIMATEENTICEMENT was
always outrun.
