MARIA ROSE good position to far turn, rallied three wide past the quarter pole and drove clear late. NO INTEREST sharp to lead, set a very slow pace to
no avail while second best. ABOGADA unhurried to far turn, rallied widest past quarter pole for third spot. SOUR PEACH went up with pace at the half, bid
to far turn with nothing left late. HOLY COOKIE was through early, never untracked with the slow pace while evenly. SEDUCTIVE (IRE) pulled from between
horses to the half and faded in the stretch. NESSUM DORMA close up to the half but droped back readily thereafter.

WILD WEEKEND just off leaders to the turn, came to the and exchanged bumping several times into stretch but survived to edged clear. DARBY DART
matched strides to the half, took over and stayed on gamely to the wire ina good effort. WORLD TAX WAR (IRE) bumped at the start, unhurried to far turn
with an outside run for show. BLIZZ well placed to far turn, exchanged bumping through the upper stretch area and weakened. MAJOR SILAS raced along
evenly while back and no response. THE SHEIK OF ARABY raced evenly, lacking the late response needed in the stretch. ENHANCED EDITION never a
real contender. SNORING BARTH always back no factor. LEA RIDGE quick into stride dueled to far turn, used up and faded. ADOLFO widest into first turn,
never close. DANCINGINTODARK never reached contention.
