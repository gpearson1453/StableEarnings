belatedly six and seven wide. DINESEN pressed on lead through the far turn dueling into upper stretch wearing down late. RICH E Z stalked the pace
racing inside vying in upper stretch finishing evenly. HIGH RISK STRATEGY pressed in bid on the far turn then weakened along the inside in upper stretch.
ALFRED pressed the early pace tiring to upper stretch.
