pace, went six wide into the turn, was gaining late and just missed. SPIRIT MISSION was up close early, raced off the rail, angled out in mid stretch and
finished with a mild late rally. TOMAHAWK TUESDAY was void of speed, shifted out eight wide through the stretch and passed tired rivals. BLUE BEES
pressed the early pace, was eased back off the pace, went seven wide into the turn and was no factor. CASABLANCA HOT was not far back early from
between rivals and faded.

Footnotes
VIX HERO set a clear early pace, raced off the rail, met the bid of DRYDEK in mid stretch, shook clear from that rival and prevailed for the win. DYRDEK
tracked the early pace, went five wide into the turn, made a bid on the winner in mid stretch, drifted in, couldn't sustain the run and finished second best.
INDY'S SONG chased the early pace, went four wide into the turn, angled out late and held for third. OFFICER OF WAR raced in mid pack, went six wide
into the turn and finished belatedly. A SHEEN CAT was taken back early, advanced seven wide and offered a mild late rally. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT was void
of speed, went three wide and offered some late gain. GODS WRITING was unhurried early and was never a factor.
