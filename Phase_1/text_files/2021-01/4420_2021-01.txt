Footnotes
CLEAR THE MINE broke with the field, settled off the pace and the inside, moved out four wide into the turn, advanced three wide into contention through
the bend, challenged on the outside of the first flight in the three path into the lane, vied past the furlong marker then edged clear under steady handling.
ALL SHACKED UP forwardly placed off the inside, crept closer late in the turn, challenged inside the winner and into the stretch, raced on equal terms and
inside the winner past the furlong marker then could not match strides late while edging clear for the place. KRISTO lacked early foot, angled out five wide
when beginning a mild rally rally late in the turn, finished early of the others down the middle of the strip. LOVETHATCAUSE in the second flight for three
furlongs off the inside, had little left for the drive. STRATE REMARK turned in an even effort while saving ground. RAVENS REFLECTION broke on top, set
the pace along the inside, gave way when headed by the top two entering the stretch. CALCULATED RISKER last away, trailed in the early going, dropped
to the inside in the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. COME ON DOVER lacked early foot, failed to respond when called on for the
drive. GALACTICA staged a steady retreat off the inside.

Footnotes
BEAUTY DAY in the second group while outside, stalked the two leaders in the three path through the turn, set down when straightened for home,
challenged inside the furlong marker, drew clear while lugging in late. COMPETITIVE FIRE lacked early foot, swung out five wide when advancing turning
into the stretch, finished willingly down the middle of the strip to be up in time for the place. MS FALSETTO lost footing at the start, trailed early as a result,
moved up steadily up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn when continuing to advance through the turn, moved out bit for room turning into the
stretch, some late interest to miss the place. LUCKY EVERY DAY broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, continued to show the way through the turn
and into the stretch, weakened when headed inside the furlong grounds to the winner, lost the place late. TAPALONG pressured the leader early off the
inside, vied through the turn, faltered in the final furlong to lose a couple of spots. BLUEBIRD DAY mid pack along the inside, continued to save the ground
while going in even fashion through the turn, came up empty when being call on in the drive. AUNT SUNSHINE off the pace while racing outside, four wide
trip through the turn, failed to muster a rally in the drive. WARM BEAUTY remained back while four wide out of the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals
while never a serious threat. ZIPPY CHICK showed little in a dull effort while racing off the inside. JUSTATAPIN tired while racing in the three path.
NANABANANA within striking distance early, steadily faded in the two path.

Footnotes
SHARECROPPER unhurried early under confident handling, advanced far turn, challenged between rivals turning for home, kicked well clear in the late
going under steady handling. DAVIDIC LINE also settled off the pace and the inside, four wide into the far turn, three wide exiting when challenging, proved
no match for the winner the final furlong, clearly second best. FIRST RATE void of early foot, three wide into the stretch, managed a tepid rally to finish up
best of the rest, no threat to the top two. BIG BIZ void of speed while three wide through the first turn, improved position while remaining off the inside.
INCORRIGIBLE took control into the first turn, shook well clear into the far turn, faltered when confronted entering the stretch. MAU MAU was never
dangerous while racing off the inside. CHANGE DIRECTION closest to the early leader, began a steady retreat after a half. WAYNE O prompted the pace
off the rail, stopped far turn.

Footnotes
FIVE STAR MOON forwardly placed placed off rail, three wide bid turning for home, lugged in slightly when taking over past the furlong marker, edged clear
under a right handed stick. ARKANSAS BLING in the second flight while off the inside, raced in some traffic into the turn, angled out slightly for some room
exiting the turn, finished willingly to be getting to the winner late, well clear of the others. RACHIE RACH away in good order, raced closet to the leader
along the inside up the backstretch, vied through the turn while remaining closet to the rail, vied into the lane, weakened in proving no match for the top two,
saved the show. HOT SPRINGS BLING off the pace and the inside, raced four out to five wide when moving a bit closer late in the turn, roused for the drive,
finished up evenly in flattening out. FEMININE ALLURE void of early speed, four wide through the turn, came five wide into the lane, improved position
without posing a serious threat. SMARTY'S ANGEL raced back off the pace outside, four wide through the turn, also lacked serious late kick. FLAT OUT
GOLD within striking distance outside, four wide through the turn, faded in the drive. GOLD N SEXY broke on top, set the pace until headed from between
horses exiting the turn. FAST SOPHIA sluggish at the start, continued well back while racing wide, continued five wide through the turn, improved a bit in the
drive while never a threat. VERY SPICY in some traffic while off the inside, had little left for the drive. CYBER SNEAKER was never a factor. COURTNEY
FAY in mid pack early, steadily faded while continuing to save ground to no avail.

Footnotes
STROLLING lacked speed outside, steady gain four then five wide through the turn, challenged on the outside into the stretch, quickly drew clear under firm
handling. CAVE RUN settled off the pace, in some traffic while working way out to the five path turning into the stretch, proved no match for the winner,
determined for the place. BELIEVEINHOLIDAYS back off the pace and the inside angled out while also in some traffic late in the turn, improved in the run to
the wire, not enough for the place. KOWBOY KARMA void of speed for a half after being bothered at the break, came five wide out of the turn and managed
a mild, late run to improve position well out in the strip. HE'S MEANT TO BE in the second flight outside, four wide late in the turn, tired in the drive in
coming up empty. ALEXANDROS broke out to bother a couple of outer rivals, quickly straightened to contest the early pace in the two path, shook briefly
clear late in the turn then faltered when confronted for the drive. MAY WE ALL within striking distance, in some traffic late in the turn, tired in the drive. FIVE
O ONE made little impact while racing in the two path. NAUGHTY ALFRED off a step slow, remained always back. HE'S NO BULL prompted the pace, was
still in pursuit when forced to steady late in the turn, fell back. TOUGH STUFF vied up front closest to the inside, fell back off the leader late in the turn,
moved out for the drive but managed only to back up in the drive.

Footnotes
SAFFA'S DAY with early pace, chased backstretch, vied between rivals through second turn and into the stretch, long drive while remaining between rivals,
narrowly best while fully extended. WINDCRACKER in the second flight along the inside, lodged an early bid into the far turn, equal terms with the winner
through the stretch, narrowly best in a good effort. HE'SMYHONEYBADGER never far back off the inside, joined the fray up front three wide after a half,
continued to do battle outside the top two through the final three furlongs to also narrowly miss. ARDANWOOD back off the early pace just off the inside,
worked way out to be five wide late in the final turn, proved no match for the top three in the drive to finish up evenly. ANTIGRAVITY four wide through the
first turn, continued outside to also be four wide through the second turn, also went evenly in the drive. WICK last away, raced back early, improved position
while not a serious threat. SAQEEL void of speed, passed tiring rivals while also not a factor. CAPTAIN FANTASTIC fractious in the gate, remained back.
SILVER TAP tired while racing off the inside. TANGO KILO fractious in the gate, was finished after a half. MAJOR CHANCE sprinted clear soon after the
start, stopped just after a half.

Footnotes
MUCHO in the second flight while racing outside, advanced on the leaders outside, bid, wore down foe after a spirted duel late. NUCLEAR OPTION four
wide into the turn when with the pace, vied three wide into the lane, extended drive, gave ground grudgingly to the winner while holding sway for the place.
ENGAGE in the second flight toward the inside, saved some ground into the lane, traffic upper stretch, lacked a closing punch when clear late. K J'S
NOBILITY raced back, continued to save some ground into the lane, switched out late, improved position, no real threat. MOJO MAN vied up front along the
inside, continued to narrowly show the way through the turn, faltered in the drive. RUBUS with the pace while between horses and inside the runner up, also
had little left when the real running began at the head of the lane. LITTLE MENACE remained always back. HOME BASE raced in mid pack, encountered
some traffic turning for home then tired in the drive. . TOUGH LOVE last away, was never involved.

Footnotes
CADDO RIVER away in good order, cleared to the inside entering the first turn, rated while cruising solo up the backstretch, steadily increased advantage
the final quarter mile under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. COWAN bothered by a rank HARDLY SWAYED into the first turn, raced back, mild
advance while three wide far turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker, was no match for that one, clearly second best. BIG THORN was last to
leave, raced four wide into the first turn when lacking speed, continued back the middle half, raced four wide again through the second bend when moving a
bit closer, long drive for the show, fully extended to prevail for that position, no threat to the top two. MOONLITE STRIKE bothered slightly into the first turn,
settled off the pace and the inside, little left for the drive, outkicked for the show spot. MARTINI BLU went one paced throughout while saving ground.
HARDLY SWAYED very rank into the first turn, chased the winner in the run up the backstretch, stopped badly, jogged in late while not being asked for
anything. LAWLESSNESS was never involved, gave way after a half, also was eased up through the stretch to be jogged in and finish far back.

Footnotes
FROST OR FRIPPERY unhurried early while off the inside, began to advance three wide into the far turn, came in the two path when moving smartly into
the lane, challenged soon after, edged clear. BODE'S MAKER settled off the inside and the early leaders, came three wide into the lane, finished up willingly
to be well clear for the place. RIVER ECHO (GB) lacked speed, three wide advance, closest with a furlong remaining, had little for the two late, clear of the
rest. CHARLIE'SARCHANGEL void of speed after stumbling at the start, raced four out to five wide midway on the final turn, also finished up evenly in
lacking a late punch. RED AGAIN prompted the early leader just off the inside, continued to pursue up the backstretch, challenged, put a head in front far
turn, faltered in the drive. DONT TELL NOOBODY back in the early going, four wide into the second turn, bothered, carried out five wide midway on that
bend, went evenly in the drive. BOBBY BABY last away, trailed early, continued back, passed some tiring rivals while not a threat. STEPHEN'S ANSWER
away well, set the pace toward the inside, continued to show the way while close to the inside into the far turn, headed soon after, gave way in the drive.
UPHOLD within striking distance for a half, gave awy. COACH ADAMS forwardly placed for three furlongs, also was finished after a half. TAKE CHARGE
D'ORO steadied, rank early, gave way early, trailed home.
