Footnotes
OUR STORMIN NORMAN took control at once then gradually widened throughout under a steady drive. CHAMPERS saved ground close up, was asked for
run on the turn and continued willingly. COURT SKY dwelt at the start, trailed long way then showed late energy. CANTSTOPRUNNING chased off the
leaders three wide and lacked a rally. BLACKJACK JEDI prompted the winner outside, made a brief bid at the three eighths pole then faded. SAILOR
AGAIN dropped back racing wide and gave way readily. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race.

Footnotes
NEW JERSEY set the pace on the inside, dueled with AIN'T NONE LUCKY entering the stretch, battled with that rival and edged away in deep stretch to
prevail. AIN'T NONE LUCKY pressed the pace in the early stages, then bid two wide, dueled with the winner on the turn, dug in gamely outside in the
stretch run and came up second best. EBO SPECIAL reluctant to load, stalked three wide, chased the leaders on the turn, raced evenly in the lane and held
for third. SECRET ZAR raced off the pace inside, went three wide past the quarter pole and gained mildly inside in the lane. RACK DADDY raced off the
pace between rivals, went four wide past the quarter pole and lacked a rally. FOUR SEASONS GIRL raced three wide off the pace, two wide on the turn and
failed to threaten. WOOD BEE tracked inside, chased on the turn and faded.

SMIRK settled outside the pacesetters, bid on the turn, repelled challenges and held on gamely. SARGEANT DRIVE chased close up inside, loomed a
threat but cold not get by the winner. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE dueled along the rail, angled out in the stretch then steadied nearing the wire. ROYAL COUP
lagged well behind then closed well wide too late. PIGGYBANK was urged close up between rivals to the stretch and weakened. ADMIRAL EASTWOOD
broke alertly and vied in the two path then proved empty in the stretch. MAMAIGOTTHIS raced far behind three wide and was never in contention. ASPEN
XTREME saved ground far behind and lacked a rally. A claim of foul by the third finisher against the winner for interference approaching the finish was
dismissed.

NEIGHBORHOOD BULLY trailed the field, advanced on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied outside, closed steadily in deep stretch and was
along in time for the win. NOBLE KENT tracked inside, bid three wide on the far turn, led into the lane, dug in gamely in the stretch drive and came up
second best. GRAY GARY pressed the pace from the outset, then dueled for the lead, battled into the lane and dug in gamely inside to the finish. RIDE ON
FAITH set the pace on the inside, dueled on the backside and weakened in the stretch. ECLIPSED MOON raced two wide off the pace, moved up on the far
turn, then failed to rally. BLINDING raced three wide early, stalked outside and gave way.

Footnotes
TOWN JAK raced close up between foes, angled wide advancing into the stretch then wore down the leaders following a long drive. FACTOR THIS IN
prompted the pace outside, led briefly in mid stretch but was outfinished. SOUPER FLY OVER earned a narrow advantage outside then inside and held
gamely to the finish. MANOLETE saved ground close up, angled out into the stretch, bid but tired in the final furlong. WON THE CASE trailed early, moved
inside and made a gradual gain. WATCH YOUR WORDS battled for the lead inside then gave way after half a mile. KINGSVILLE chased wide off the pace,
moved closer on the turn then faded. UNDER THE GRAYDAR raced just off leaders between foes and weakened. BOLITA BOYZ lacked speed and was
never in contention. A claim of foul by the rider of WATCH YOUR WORDS against the rider of SOUPER FLY OVER for interference on the turn was
dismissed.
