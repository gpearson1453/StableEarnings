Footnotes
UNDERCOVER LOVER broke alertly, narrowly set the pace while along the inside for a half, shook off the other speed into the lane, drew out under steady
handling. HERE COMES DOC last away to be devoid of any early foot, continued back while four wide through the turn, raced widest in the drive when
mounting a rally, up for the place, no real threat to the winner. TENTWELVEFOURTEEN outrun for a half off the inside, raced three wide through the bend,
staged a mild rally inside the runner up to annex the show spot. WILLS DEFENCE pressured the winner from the outside for four furlongs, weakened in the
drive. DAAHER'S SUCCESS mid pack early along the inside, briefly boxed when continuing to save ground into the turn, came in the two path for the drive,
not dangerous while improving position slightly. REPLETE within striking distance while racing three wide, came up empty for the drive. CARDIAC KITTEN
settled behind the pace.

Footnotes
ITSALLINTHENOTES forwardly placed, two path through most of the turn, shifted out for the drive, challenged when straightened for home, finished with
good energy to win going away. FACTUAL forwardly placed under some encouragement up the backstretch inside, fell back turn, came again for the place,
no match for the winner. MISS MESS last to leave, moved outside, swept up to challenged in the three path turning for home, put a head in front upper
stretch, weakened the final furlong. MILANA broke alertly, cleared toward the inside, dropped further to the rail for the turn, weakened when headed in upper
stretch. UNDECIDEDCERTAINTY lacked speed, went one paced while racing three wide. YES I'M LOOKING void of speed, passed a couple of tiring rivals
after the issue had been decided. JUST LIFE in mid pack early, steadily faded. POSEIDON'S MAGIC was also finished early.

Footnotes
IKE dropped inside before a quarter to set the pace, continued to show the way into the far turn, disposed of a rival late in that bend, drifted out late,
narrowly held the runner up at bay in the final strides under brisk handling. HIT THE TICKET settled off the pace and the inside, began a steady advance
three wide far turn, late bid on the outside the winner, denied. GOSPEL ABE lacked speed, three wide in the second turn when making a mild advance,
finished best of the rest while not a serious threat to the top two. ICE CRUSH lacked speed, raced in the two path through both turns, improved a bit into the
lane then flattened out. ALTITO void of speed while saving some ground, in some traffic while continuing along the rail into the far turn, steered out to be
three wide for the drive, improved position while passing tiring rivals. DETERMINANT four wide into the first turn, dropped in slightly to save some ground,
moved out to be four wide again through the final bend, lacked a rally in the drive. BAQUERO FLIES chased the winner for six furlongs off the inside, gave
way turning for home. WHEREWEGOIN tired after a half.

Footnotes
DRENA'S STAR broke sharp, set the pace along the inside, shook clear when straightened for home, maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire under
steady handling. D' RAPPER in the second flight up the backstretch outside, pressed the winner through the turn, could not keep up with that one in the
drive while edging clear for the place. WELL CONNECTED last away, raced well back off the early pace toward the inside, steadied slightly inside of traffic
into the turn, dropped to the rail turning for home when improving, finished up best of the rest. HOONANI ROAD within striking distance while between
rivals, lacked a kick in the drive. HIGH PROOF off the pace and the inside, was four wide exiting the turn, also came up empty for the drive. OMEN OF
CHANGE made little impact while racing in the three path. HIDDEN RULER forwardly placed along the inside, in some traffic into the turn, began a steady
fade before a half.

Footnotes
SHACKS WAY broke sharp, soon got clear while in hand, given a breather through the turn, widened through the lane while not being asked for his best,
won geared down. CASCADE KING lacked speed while racing outside, four wide through the turn, rallied for the place while remaining well out in the
stretch, proved no match for the winner, edging clear for the place. BODE'S LIGHT chased the winner off the inside, could do little with that one through the
stretch, caught second, saved the show. NEW DICE broke a step behind the field, moved up in mid pack, waited through much of the turn when mired in
traffic, improved when clear for the drive. EPIC ADVENTURE forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch along the inside, weakened in the drive. PAPA
JIMMY off a step slow, raced back and outside, four wide into the far turn, went evenly through the stretch. FUNANDFUNNY failed to menace while racing
off the inside. BOORNAZIAN tired from early efforts. HUNKY DUNN trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
TAPITOR unhurried early out in the strip, continued back, advanced into contention while four wide turning for home, drifted stretch, bothered, brush
midstretch, drifted in again late, dug in the final strides to prevail in game fashion. WAGON BOSS forwardly placed from the start, pressed between rivals
the middle half, fell back midway in the second turn, moved out, rebid inside the winner nearing midstretch, brushed, then lugged out, was in turn brushed
by the winner when that one once again drifted in late, outkicked in the late going. CHICORY BLUE behind the first flight in the early going, three wide
middle move to contend before a half, put a head front and showed the way into and through the final turn, gradually weakened the final furlong in failing to
match strides with the top two. EXEMPLAR void of speed, worked way out to be three wide turning into the stretch, staged a mild rally improve position a bit.
ROCKO'S WHEEL broke on top, quickly cleared to the inside, set the early pace, vied the next half mile while remaining closest to the inside, had little left
when the real running began at the head of the lane. FLASHYMEISTER within striking distance toward the inside, began to fade before a half. FORT
RIDGE remained always back. POP LIFE fell back after the start, remained far behind, lost contact with the field, distanced, jogged in.

Footnotes
TUMBLING SKY broke sharp, soon got clear and to the inside, set all the pace, enough left to hold off the runner up in the waning strides while remaining
inside. LULLABY BLING lacked speed well out in the strip, rallied four out to five wide exiting the turn, challenged the winner late from the outside, missed.
MO'S MOJO lacked speed while racing in the three path, moved a bit closer in some traffic late in the turn, worked way out to four wide into the lane,
finished willingly down the middle of the strip while too late. CABOT raced in midpack while along the inside, asked along when clear late in the bend,
improved position then flattened out in the late going. SOMETHING SUPER void of speed, raced three out to four wide through the turn, improved position
while not posing a serious threat. HURRICANE JAKE within striking distance while racing along the inside, moved out into the two path for the drive, came
up empty when asked. MAJOR ATTRACTION lacked speed just off the inside, dropped to the open rail late in the turn, improved into the lane and continued
to show some mild interest to the wire. MISTER OAKLEY in the second flight while in the three path, weakened in the drive. K W CAPTAIN HOOK off a step
slow, trailed for a half, passed some tiring rivals. BULLION prompted the pace outside, four wide into the turn, faltered through the stretch. HOOF PRINCE
pressed the pace for four furlongs, was tiring when in a bit tight in traffic turning into the lane. BLACKTOP LEGEND finished early.

Footnotes
JILTED BRIDE allowed the pace to go early, advanced 2nd turn, moved out, engaged leader into the lane, wore down that rival under steady handling.
GLAMOUR GIRL chased the early leader, took over before a half, clear into the far turn, responded when the winner came alongside into the lane and gave
ground grudgingly to that rival, clearly second best. AUCTION FEVER void of speed off the inside, three wide far turn, dropped to the rail late in that bend,
improved upper stretch to reach closest to the top pair, lasted for the show. TONAL VISION bobbled at the start, was righted the settle off the pace, three
wide in the second turn, went evenly in the drive to be outkicked late for the show. MALIBU MARLEE last away, raced back, four wide into the far turn,
advanced a bit turning for home then flattened out in the drive. SHACKADELIC fractious in the gate, broke alertly, got clear early, stopped when headed by
the runner up after four furlongs.

Footnotes
MISS ANTIOCH never far back, three wide in the turn, challenged and took over inside the furlong grounds, drove well clear. WILLOW MOON broke sharp,
dueled up front closest to the inside, briefly got clear turning into the stretch, could not last, held part of place. EURO ME in mid pack early outside, raced
three wide in the turn, rallied while continuing off the inside and finished willingly to earn the dead heat for the place. ZANSHOES within striking distance
while off the inside, worked way toward the inside late in the turn, waited briefly midway on the bend, flattened out a bit in the drive to finish up evenly.
FLORIDA BIRD in mid pack while outside, five down to four wide in the turn, steered in a bit for the drive, failed to rally. POWERFULATTRACTION settled
off the pace toward the inside, angled three wide into lane, continued evenly to the wire. TURNSTONE broke out to bother outer rivals, raced back, saved
ground into lane, improved position. MOCHA KISS four out to five wide in the turn when back off the pace, no rally. FLATOUTANDFOXY bothered at bit at
the start to be last away, never a threat. R MARIE dueled up front in the two path, gave way in the drive.
