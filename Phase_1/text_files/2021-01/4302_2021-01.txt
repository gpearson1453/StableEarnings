Footnotes
IOVA broke in at the start and was corrected, chased three paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking along the inside through the turn, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, angled in to the two path nearing the eighth pole, rallied to issue a challenge
and take command just inside the sixteenth marker, then inched away to the finish kept to task. BUSTINMYGROOVE bobbled at the break recovering
inwards under coaxing, chased just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, advanced on that rival to apply pressure through the turn placed to coaxing
near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch seizing command, dug in under a drive being directed out to get a look at DRAMATIC TWIST near
the eighth pole, then got directed inwards towards IOVA, got headed for the front inside the sixteenth pole and ran on to be along clear for the place honors.
DRAMATIC TWIST chased four to five wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid to threat a
furlong from home before weakening in the late stages. HALF DAY PAM five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the
turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and passed tired foes. NEW YORK BANKER bobbled at the break and
came under hustling to establish the front shortly after crossing to settle in hand along the inside, came under increasing pressure through the turn from
BUSTINMYGROOVE to the outside and got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths in response, yielded the front near the quarter pole and took the inside
route into upper stretch, then weakened through to the finish. TEN PLAGUES bobbled at the break, chased three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. SAYOH chased inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and
trailed. Please note that each rider carried an additional two pounds as required by a winter racing safety initiative.

Footnotes
DIDDLEY cut over to the rail after establishing the top when put to a brisk hand ride, dueled with the second place finisher from out in the two path, was the
first of that twosome to have its pilot commit to a drive, this occurring a few jumps shy of the quarter pole, continued to battle down the lane eye to eye with
the nemesis, had its path squeezed a bit by FOX RED in the final sixteenth, saw the pair go on to exchange very light contract at least thrice, refused to be
intimidated and gamely reached the wire first by the narrowest of margins. FOX RED sparred for command with the winner from the two path, turned into
the lane getting roused for the initial time, raced directly abreast of DIDDLEY clutching the barest of leads, inched its way over to the top one springing from
the sixteenth pole, traded off light brushes several times with top one, wound up the one to be denied. BATTERBATTERSWING remained stationed in the
two path after losing its footing at the start, crept up to the front runners during the run around the bend, eventually posing a danger, got eased towards path
three for entrance into the stretch, settled in and was given his cue, flattened out. RELEASETHETHUNDER sent over to the rail at the top of the turn, was
under a ride angling three wide into the stretch, shifted one wider at the eighth pole, lacked the necessary response. HAWAIIAN NOISES rode the rail for
the opening half, went four wide into the stretch, failed to fire. EL POTRO travelled three to four wide on the turn, got sent out into path six from upper to
midlane, had no gain then was vanned off after the finish. ABBAA three wide onto the turn, was worked into path five from upper to midlane, gave way. All
riders carried an additional two pounds in accordance with a weather-related safety initiative.

Footnotes
OUR LAST BUCK five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn, remained patiently handled until set down angled
five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, edged clear under a drive kept to task. FUNNY GUY four then three wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into upper stretch, rallied to be heads apart for command a furlong out, ran on to chase the winner
home clear of the rest. RUNNINGWSCISSORS bobbled at the break and broke on top despite it, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked along
the inside half a mile from home, came under some pressure through the latter portion of the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat
yielding the front just outside the eighth pole, then weakened through to the finish. MY BOY TATE hustled from the gate, raced forwardly placed along the
inside to the five-eighths marker when tipped out from in behind the aforementioned foe to chase three then two wide, advanced through the turn to apply
pressure to that rival coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened. CELTIC CHAOS devoid of speed, settled along
the inside detached at the tail of the field, got coaxed along three furlongs out, swung three wide into upper stretch and trailed. Please note that all riders
carried an additional two pounds as per a winter weather safety initiative.

Footnotes
SHESADIRTYDANCER grabbed the advantage shortly after the field had been sent on its way, got guided over to the rail, showed the way firmly rated for
the opening half, began to kick clear of the competition late on the turn, was deep into the furlong grounds when called upon for more, dug in well to
preserve the decision. BETSY BLUE made light contact with TELLAPERFECTTALE in the shadow of the starting gate, displayed no last effects, departed
the backstretch towards path four, came under a ride spinning about a path closer to the rail into the stretch, failed to dent the margin in the last eighth
procuring the place. TELLAPERFECTTALE brushed from both sides at the start, took up the chase two wide on the turn, was in the same path heading onto
the top of the lane, ventured onward to be along for the show. ENTER SANDWOMAN three wide onto the turn, was likewise there coming into the stretch,
had no punch. SASSY MELISSA loosely pocketed, cut the corner under a drive, flattened out. EMPIRES FIRST LADY slid over to the rail at the half mile
pole, was put to a hand ride during the run the bend, stepped into the lane and made no impact. DELAWARE DESTINY out with its initial step, got corrected
but not before brushing with another, sat forwardly placed from the two path during the opening phases, got set down coming up to midpoint on the turn,
shifted four wide settling onto the top of the lane, folded. AURANNIAN three wide in pursuit of the front runners on the turn, angled five wide for the drive,
gave way. MOONLIGHT KISS gathered after coming in at the start, raced four wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one farther off the inside, launched
no bids. All riders carried an additional two pounds in accordance with a weather-related safety initiative.

Footnotes
VIOLENT POINT established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from FLUSH to the outside, remained patiently handled
until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive holding well to the wire. QUIETUDE broke out at the start and was
corrected, chased two then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, offered up a mild kick closing in late,
came out under a near sided stick lightly herding WAILIN JOSIE inside the final seventy yards and brushing with that rival and was just up for the place
honors on the line. WAILIN JOSIE stumbled at the start, recovered to chase two then three wide down the backstretch before tipping four wide through the
turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide for home, dug in under a drive running on to the finish, got brushed inside the final seventy
yards as the aforementioned foe came out and was herded at most half a path when nailed on the wire for the place honors. NEW YORK ROCK STAR
coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and improved position.
STEAL MY HEART chased three to four wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, went four wide into upper stretch and weakened. FLUSH coaxed from
the start, pressed the pace from the two path, got let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong. LUNE LAKE three then two
wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, was briefly taken in hand off heels of QUIETUDE at the quarter pole, cornered just off the inside
into upper stretch and weakened. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into deep stretch focusing on QUIETUDE as well as a Jockey's objection lodged by the
rider of WAILIN JOSIE against QUIETUDE alleging interference. After review, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official. Please
note all riders carried an additional two pounds as per a winter weather safety initiative.

Footnotes
THIS ILL DEFEND narrowly escaped some contact in the shadow of the starting gate, sat reserved three wide on the turn, tipped out into the four path late
on the bend in preparation for the drive home, challenged in earnest entering the top of the lane, took charge during the run leading up to and then through
the furlong grounds and kicked clear. RATIFY put to a snug hold tracking the front runners from the pocket, got roused swinging to the outside for the drive,
was worked into path four from upper to midstretch, rallied for the place. FRENCH TOAST bumped from both sides, was in path two vying from between
foes for nearly three-quarters, was under a ride spinning into the lane, saw the top one take control soon afterwards, backed away in the final furlong.
RETICENT bumped at the start, pursued the pace three wide on the turn, got maneuvered to the inside at the five-sixteenths pole, cut the corner with
clearance after several others had chosen wider paths for entrance into the stretch, mustered up a mild response. MY FIRST GRAMMY bumped at the start,
assumed a forward position, was along the rail, contending for the top as the innermost of three for six furlongs, stepped into the stretch and faltered.
ZUZUDINI went over to the rail, rode it until the end of the bend, was asked to pick it up at the five-sixteenths pole, angled four wide into t he stretch, made
no impact. ORPHAN HALLIE strung out three to four wide, got moved out into path five entering the stretch, gave way. A GRAY FOR CAROLYN travelled
two to three wide on the turn, swung out five wide into the stretch, lacked the necessary response. FIXATION three wide contending for the top versus a pair
of opponents to his inside, folded. TRUE PALACE four wide onto the turn, went into path six exiting it, trailed. All riders carried an additional two pounds in
accordance with a weather-related safety initiative.

Footnotes
SIENA MAGIC established the front and showed the way lightly coaxed along in the two path, tucked inside half a mile from home, cut the corner into upper
stretch, dug in under an off sided stick, came under threat and came out now under a near sided stick inside the eighth pole, brushing then bumping his
main danger and herding him two to three paths to the sixteenth marker, got bumped seventy yards from home by SNEAKINESS coming in despite a near
sided stick on that rival and just held on at the finish. SNEAKINESS four then three wide in aim of the front, got set down spinning three then two wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong latching on the top one, got brushed, bumped, then herded two to three
paths nearing the sixteenth marker as SIENA MAGIC came out under a near sided stick, came inwards bumping with SIENA MAGIC seventy yards from
home coming back on and just missed at the end. JAKE ROCKS chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued four to five wide
into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. MUCH TROUBLE five to six wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung six wide
into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. CAVARADOSSI chased three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened. BEAVER CREEK got pinched after the start due to pressure outside from THE BIG S and
inside from SIENA MAGIC, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and made no impact. THE BIG S broke in
at the start bumping THERISASTORMBREWIN into CAVARADOSSI and in turn MR PHIL, got steadied after the break in tight between foes, chased four
then three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. MR PHIL chased three then two wide under coaxing
from midway on the turn, swung six wide for home and tired. THERISASTORMBREWIN bumped at the start by THE BIG S who broke inwards, chased
three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and faltered. There was Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run
focusing on SIENA MAGIC as well as a Jockey's Objection by the rider of SNEAKINESS alleging interference in the stretch against SIENA MAGIC. After
review, SIENA MAGIC was disqualified from first and placed second, having been deemed to have interfered with SNEAKINESS before the race was
declared official. Please note all riders carried an additional two pounds due to a winter weather safety initiative.

AWESOME DEBATE retained the advantage after out-breaking the competition, cut the pace from along the inside route, was called upon being put to the
test by its uncoupled stablemate turning into the lane, flicked off that opponent's bid then held well to stay in the clear. BABY BOSS kept watch on the
winner from just off the rail, idled along late on the bend awaiting options, got gradually worked into the five path during the first half of the stretch run, kicked
into its best and rallied willingly enough to get up for second. MISS JIMMY three to four wide in pursuit of the front runners on the turn, was more the latter
for the beginning of the stretch run, fell narrowly short of snagging away the place. MY ROXY GIRL two wide on the backstretch, tracked the winner from the
pocket from the top of the turn until the five-sixteenths pole, was back into path two challenging for the front end heading onto the top of the lane, flattened
out. RUVIES IN TIME three wide at the top of the turn as well as the head of the stretch, had no punch. DOLL stumbled badly after being released at the
break, departed the backstretch from path four, got sent out into path six entering upper stretch, venturing onward as the widest of all, launched no bids.
BEAUX ARTS forwardly placed early, pressed the issue from path two until the five-sixteenths pole, folded. All riders carried an additional two pounds in
accordance with a weather-related safety initiative.

MR. SHORTANDSIMPLE three wide in closest aim of the leader, advanced to duel with that rival into the turn widening away from the rest, spun three wide
for home shaking off SCORESWHENHEWANTS to draw off to the eighth pole, dug in leg weary drifting out under a near sided stick and held safe to the
finish. MANDATORY PAYOUT chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a
mild kick to close in on the leg weary leader while along clear of the rest for the place honors. FRIED RICE KING chased just off the inside down the
backstretch, went four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show
honors. VITESSE veered in at the start despite correction by the rider and bumped TRUE BLUE GIANT solidly bobbling and staggering both charges went
clipping each other's legs, chased two to three wide at the tail of the field, went five wide through the turn and then seven wide into upper stretch and
improved position for the last major share. SCORESWHENHEWANTS showed the way early on along the inside, had the eventual winner advance and
dueled with that rival widening away from the rest through the turn, got shaken off near the quarter pole and angled out four wide into upper stretch, then
weakened in the drive. ECONOMIC POLICY chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and
passed tired foes. CLASSY PAPA chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, went four wide into upper stretch and tired.
TRUEBELIEVE chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, tired. BIG'S GRAY DAY three wide in
pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. ORAZIO chased five to six wide under coaxing from three
furlongs out, continued five wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact. TRUE BLUE GIANT tossed his head to the near side at the start getting
away a half a beat slow, then got bumped solidly by the veering out VITESSE, clipping with that rival, the rider coming out of the irons when bobbling
heavily, got guided outside and was pulled up and walked off under his own power. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the start focusing on TRUE BLUE
GIANT before the result stood and the race was declared official. Please note all riders carried an additional two pounds due to a winter weather safety
initiative.
