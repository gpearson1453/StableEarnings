Footnotes
LADY MADISON raced in the four path the first turn then stalked three wide, challenged at the seven sixteenths pole and took the nod past the quarter,
drew clear into the lane and was steadily handled to draw off. WHIZ PASS rounded the first turn about the four path and raced outside into the backstretch,
bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn still in the four path then dueled the length of the stretch for second. PERSONAL SERVER
settled off the pace and off the rail early on, raced toward the outside into the backstretch and bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about
the three path and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. WAKES UP HAPPY stalked the early pace off the rail then took the lead two deep past the
half mile pole, came under pressure from the seven sixteenths, yielded the advantage leaving the quarter, dropped back into the stretch and weakened.
WALKNTHEPLANK settled off the pace inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, angled to the five path into the stretch
but showed little more. BEYOND PRETTY rated the pace inside, was caught leaving the half mile pole, gave chase from that point then faded past the five
sixteenths.

Footnotes
DIAL EMMA REILLY saved ground off the early pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, dug in past the eighth
pole to take the lead mid-stretch and dug in determinedly to hold off the game effort of CALLINGHERCOLLINS, who stalked three wide and moved to even
terms leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead past the five sixteenths, raced clear on the far turn, but drifted outward toward the head of the lane, dug in
under steady encouragement when straightened away, was caught mid-stretch and reluctantly ceded. MOLLY BOLTS settled back off the rail the first turn,
picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and was along to take third inside the eighth pole. CARROT
CAKE raced with the early pace two deep then took the lead toward the half mile pole, came under pressure nearing the seven sixteenths pole, was caught
leaving the five sixteenths and weakened on the far turn. ANSHI set the early pace inside, was met leaving the five eighths pole, ceded the advantage into
the backstretch, gave chase from that point but faded at the rail rounding the far turn. MNEMOSYNE raced outside into the backstretch and never factored.
SMOOKIE raced off the pace two deep the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response.

Footnotes
TICKER TAPE PARADE settled close off the rail the first turn, started a three wide bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the nod past the pole and
contested even terms at the rail on the far turn, then dug in under a determined all out stretch drive to keep the nod. WALL raced in the four path the first
turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady encouragement
and got up for second under the wire. FLY E DUBAI took the lead two deep past the five eighths pole and came under pressure leaving the seven
sixteenths, was caught leaving the three eighths but contested even terms two deep rounding the far turn, dug in gamely to deep stretch before grudgingly
ceding, and was nipped from second under the wire. SMOKIN HOT FACTOR raced with the early pace inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn about the four path, drifted into the stretch and showed little more. THE IRON BANK raced in the five path the opening turn and was
well off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and showed little more. SCRAP IRON
PHIL settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn, eased outward into the backstretch but showed little response. CATONSVILLE stalked the early pace
about the four path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then faded off the rail on the far turn.

REDOUBTABLE was hustled along with the runner-up, contested the turn two deep, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and inched clear under the wire.
STERLING CAESAR was hustled along with the pace and contested the turn at the rail, dug in under steady encouragement from the head of the lane but
gave up the nod mid-stretch and reluctantly ceded later yards. MINI BOLT gave chase, raced in the three path of the turn and ran evenly down the lane.
GRECIAN ADMIRAL chased inside, rounded the turn at the rail and finished evenly. JEN'S ORPHAN chased the pace, raced off the rail on the turn and ran
evenly through the lane. WINTER IS HERE gave chase through the backstretch and was carried out into the turn. LUCKY PENGUIN hopped from the gate
and moved to the outside to give chase, angled outside Don'tmesswithbull into the turn and showed nothing further. DON'TMESSWITHBULL chased the
pace while looking for a clear path, but suffered a fatal injury and was taken to the outside into the turn, then euthanized on the track. The stewards
reviewed this race before posting it official.

Footnotes
CANDY INVASION raced well off the early pace and was eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, steadily progressed in the
three path of the far turn, angled to the rail past the eighth pole and took the lead in the upper stretch, then dug in under steady encouragement to hold on
well. CHOCO ROCO settled just off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, was carried to the seven path nearing the end
of the turn then dug in under steady stretch encouragement to duel for second later yards. RETURN TO ME raced off the pace in the three path the first
turn, dueled at a close disadvantage through the far turn, was carried out toward the head of the lane, dug in gamely to the finish but was nipped from
second the final strides. PISTOL P raced in the five path the first turn and closed to the lead nearing the three eighths pole, contested the edge closest the
rail on the far turn, drifted out approaching the top of the lane and was caught leaving the eighth pole, continued close through the upper stretch but
flattened stride later yards. STRIDE ON BY saved ground off the pace the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole,
raced at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly down the lane. CAYATANO raced well off the pace about the three path the first turn then eased out into the
backstretch, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and showed little further. TWENTYTWENTY set the early pace
inside, was met nearing the three eighths pole, dropped back at the quarter then faded at the rail on the far turn. MISTER DEEKS saved ground through the
opening turn, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, but weakened toward the far turn. CRISTIANO BOY rounded the first turn in the six
path and was never a factor. A BIT OF HARLOW raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then faded approaching the
far turn.
