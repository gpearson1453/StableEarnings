POSITIVE SKEW lagged far back early, circled five wide into the stretch, rallied steadily and was along in time outside rivals. FREDDYMO FACTOR stayed
in range three wide and in the clear for six furlongs, bid through upper stretch, and battled back inside GHOSTLY BEAUTY to regain the place. GHOSTLY
BEAUTY saved ground early, swung four wide into the stretch, rallied to a short lead late, but was outfinished between horses. GLORIOUS GAL set the
pace inside to mid stretch, and gave way inside. I WONDER put in a mild run three wide turning for home, then flattened out. STORMY DERBY DAY saved
ground to no avail. JIMMYSSMOKEDCARROT raced two wide and posed no threat. CACTUS KITTEN hesitated and came out two lengths behind the
next-to-last horse, and was no menace. BOATLOADOFNERVE was outrun inside. MISS OVER THERE pressed the pace two wide, and folded up in the
stretch. CAPELINE pressed the pace inside, and was finished after six furlongs. TWILIGHT GALAXY was four wide early, and faltered after a half-mile.

Footnotes
BETWEEN DREAMS set a pressured pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive. WELL SHES HANDSOME pressed the
winner two wide, reached near even terms near the quarter pole but was no match for that foe in the lane. PRETZEL chased the pace three wide, lacked
rally but held off a foe for the show. DANCE FOR THE SUN raced four wide in midpack and never threatened. BELLA GABRIELLA failed to menace while
racing three wide. LADY TAPATIA was in range two wide but came up empty in the lane. QUEEN ASHY BABY was outrun inside. RUN SILENT played no
factor while racing two and three wide. CAVE CREEK was in tight at the start, had brief speed inside, stopped in the lane, was eased and jogged across the
finish line.

FRIENDLY FELLA stayed close early outside, took over with a three-wide run midway past the three-eighths, moved inside drawing clear through upper
stretch and widened under a steady drive. MOON PISTOL idled in traffic behind and between horses around the turn two wide, rallied through between foes
coming to the eighth-pole and finished willingly. MR. CESCO broke a step slowly, raced two to three wide around the turn, and offered a mild response
outside. IT'S A RISK advanced three wide after a half-mile, but could not sustain the bid. TEXTPECTATION advanced three then four wide around the turn,
but flattened out into the lane. FRANCO'S TEAM raced forwardly two wide for a half, and tired. FLAMING HOT showed early speed inside, was shuffled
back through the turn, swung widest into the lane and was empty. SUCCESSFUL ROMAN set the early pace inside, and retreated once displaced for
command.

ALEXANDER VALLEY raced off the pace three wide around the first turn, edged closer four wide rounding the far turn then rallied widest through the lane.
PERFORMING ARTS settled off the pace while racing two wide, bid inside in midstretch and was outkicked. COURAGEOUSLY was reluctant to load, set
the pace along the rail, switched to the right lead near the quarter pole, drifted out in the lane and weakened. CELLIST was in range four wide around the
first turn, three wide around the far turn, tried to split rivals nearing the eighth pole but was shut off and faded while racing greenly afterwards. STREET

and three wide. THRUSTER had early speed three wide between foes, angled in late on the first turn, chased inside down the backstretch and faded around

and was up outside NICOLE PRINCESS nearing the wire. NICOLE PRINCESS tracked the pace two wide, checked attempting to get through between the
leaders a quarter-mile out, moved out to the four-path for the drive, reached the front outside STRONG AZTECA leaving the furlong grounds, then was
nailed at the finish. SHE'S CLASSY raced close up inside for a half-mile, bid along the rail through mid stretch and was outfinished. TIME'S ON MY SIDE
raced three then four wide around the turn, and lacked the needed closing bid. STRONG AZTECA set a pressured pace to the stretch, and was overhauled
from both sides into the final furlong. GREENWOOD DRIVE was in tight on the rail and took a couple awkward strides near the nine-sixteenths pole, moved
out widest coming off the turn and made no appreciable headway. PINK FIZZ vied for command outside STRONG AZTECA around the turn, and faded
through the drive. YELLOWSTONE GIRL bumped with PANDORICA at the start, and was outrun two wide. PANDORICA bumped with YELLOWSTONE

ROCKSTAR RO stalked the pace inside, tipped two wide near the quarter pole, kicked clear in midstretch and just lasted. CANDY JAR raced off the pace
three wide, angled further out in upper stretch and finished strongly to just miss. COMEDY TOWN lacked early speed while racing two and three wide, made

ANNEX saved ground unhurried early, swung four wide getting in gear past the quarter-pole, kicked in strongly outside rivals under hand urging and shaken
reins, and drew clear late. SHAFTESBURY went along in striking range for six furlongs inside, moved out rallying outside CONRAD THE RED and
EVERESTING into the final furlong, got the best of those two but was outfinished just inside the winner. HE'SPUREGOLD raced in the second flight saving
ground to midway on the far turn, moved out three wide into the lane and rallied mildly. CONRAD THE RED cut an even pace inside to the stretch, and
weakened past the eighth-pole. EVERESTING hopped slightly at the break and bumped with SPEIGHT AND MALICE, loomed menacingly three then four
wide after six furlongs, but flattened out through the last eighth of a mile. CAMBI LION broke slowest and angled to the rail at the back, stayed inside and
improved through the stretch without threatening. SPEIGHT AND MALICE bumped with EVERESTING at the start, raced two wide and lacked the needed
response. HEY PADRE was always outrun. HARD KNOCKING prompted the pace outside CONRAD THE RED under a firm hold early, came up empty
turning for home and was allowed to fade away. BOTTOM DECK raced forwardly three wide to the far turn, and retired.

LAST JUDGMENT took control after the start, rated along a bit removed from the rail for six furlongs, increased the margin coming off the far turn in the
three-path, and continued to move away under a drive. NOBLE DRAMA was allowed to settle early inside, moved swiftly past rivals four wide around the far
turn, could not reach the winner but dug in to take a late battle for the place. ROMAN EMPIRE saved ground in striking range to the stretch, stayed on the
rail for the drive and was edged for the place. QUENANE advanced three wide after six furlongs, but could not sustain the rally. RED CRESCENT stayed
close two wide for six furlongs, and drifted wide dropping back into the stretch. KAUFY BEAN prompted the pace four then three wide around the first turn,
stopped abruptly after six furlongs and jogged in far behind.

Footnotes
CAJUN BROTHER tracked the pace three wide, steadily gained outside of EXTRAVAGENT KID through the lane and was up in deep stretch.
EXTRAVAGANT KID was clipped behind soon after the start, stalked the pace inside, took over inside of the pacesetter leaving the quarter pole, drew clear
in upper stretch but could not quite withstand the winner late. WITH VERVE was bumped between foes at the start, raced far back inside, rallied up the rail
through midstretch, angled three wide leaving the eighth pole and continued to gain. SOUPER STONEHENGE was bumped at the start, clipped heels soon
after, advanced four wide around the turn and evened out in the lane. LEGAL DEAL was bumped between rivals at the start, raced four wide and never
threatened. INTER MIAMI set the pace in the two path and tired in the drive. JACKSON had early speed three wide and retreated after a half. OLD TIME
REVIVAL broke out and bumped at the start, chased the pace outside and was through early.

Footnotes
VENEZUELAN HUG was outrun early, moved to contention four wide after six furlongs, rallied steadily through the stretch, reached the front past the
sixteenth-pole and edged away. SHAMROCKET broke slowly and lagged far back for a half-mile, circled five wide approaching the stretch, and finished
willingly on the far outside. MONFORTE chased outside PROVEN STRATEGIES for six furlongs, stayed on between horses through the late stages and
salvaged the show. OVER THE CHANNEL settled in the middle of the field two then three wide for six furlongs, found himself behind a wall of horses in
upper stretch, and finished gamely through traffic between foes. PROVEN STRATEGIES set a sharp pace, remained clear past the furlong marker, then
was overrun. SECOND MATE hugged the rail to the top of the stretch in the second flight, and made no headway in the two-path. CLEAR DESTINATION
tracked inside to the stretch, had aim in the two-path after straightening away, but had no final kick. MAX K. O. stayed in range two to three wide to the
stretch, and was overrun from both sides through the furlong grounds. GALLEON MAST trailed inside to the stretch, was stymied along the rail through the
lane and could never be fully set down. RUN-UP DISTANCE UNAVAILABLE.
