midstretch, switched leads leaving the eighth pole, was put to right-handed pressure and cleared off. THOROVER set the pace along the rail under pressure
from the winner, battled to midstretch and was second best late. EXXTOP stalked the pace four wide, angled in a bit to be three wide by the five-sixteenths
pole, could not match strides with the top two in upper stretch but held well clear of the rest. BONNO failed to menace while racing two and three wide.
PULL A FREDDIE hit the starting gate, saved ground and never threatened. SPEIGHT prompted the pace three wide, weakened midway around the turn,
angled in nearing the five-sixteenths pole continued to retreat. NOTHIN' MIZZEN was outrun while racing two wide. TORQUE was outrun inside.

Footnotes
SOCIALLY ASTRAY advanced three then four wide after a half-mile, overhauled the leaders from outside entering the final furlong, and edged clear under
pressure. MS BIG SPRING vied early inside MY LITTLE ROSE, came into the stretch in the two-path facing challengers from both flanks, could not handle
the winner but came back on outside MYFIRSTEXWIFE to regain second. MYFIRSTEXWIFE tracked from close range inside, slipped through on the rail to
reach the front in upper stretch, could not match strides with SOCIALLY ASTRAY and weakened between horses late. SHES ONE MAD MOMMA stayed
close three wide for a half-mile, moved inward through the furlong grounds and finished evenly on the rail. BLESSED BEAST broke a step slow, moved off
the inside to wind up five wide at the top of the lane, and had no rally. MY LITTLE ROSE contested the pace outside MS BIG SPRING to the stretch, and
tired. ITSENOUGH broke slow, stayed in range early between horses before dropping back through the turn, pulled up in distress in upper stretch, and was
vanned off.

Footnotes
SCATNAP settled off the pace along the inside, circled four wide around the far turn, seized command leaving the quarter pole, angled in nearing the and
drew off under a drive. NYMUE'S TREASURE stalked the pace two and three wide, was no match for the winner but finished willingly to be clearly second
best. LILLIE'S HEAT set the pace in the two path, had no response for the winner nearing the lane, angled out when that one cut across turning for home
and weakened. OBLIO'S WISH saved ground off the pace and lacked the needed rally. SWEET STORY chased the pace two and three wide and lacked a
closing bid. INTEREST was always outrun while racing in the two path. WATCHIN THE WHEELS prompted the pace two and three wide and was eased
through the lane.

DESCENTE advanced to contention inside after a half-mile, moved through on the rail to take over around the turn, drew well clear under a drive and was
hand urged the last sixteenth of a mile. FREE TO FLY broke outward, pursued TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR from outside early, lodged a three-wide bid midway on
the turn, proved no match for the winner after six furlongs and ran on best of the others. DANA GRACE raced three wide, lacked a solid response and went
clear for the show. WITCH HUNTER was forced out a bit at the start by FREE TO FLY, raced three wide and tired after six furlongs. ETANA broke slowly
and was never involved. TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR dashed clear early, got overhauled from both sides on the turn, and had nothing left in the lane.

FLORALA AL set a clear pace in the two path and held firm under a drive. COMPETITIVE HERO broke in and bumped foes at the start, had some speed
inside, hit the rail entering the turn, saved ground around the bend, bid inside of the winner in upper stretch but was held at bay. TOP BOSS stalked the
pace three wide, lacked a rally but won the battled outside of a foe for the show. UNCAPTURED SOLDIER tracked the pace two wide between foes, lacked
the needed rally and was outfinished for third. GEGE CONQUEST bumped with KING TARZAN at the start, raced well back three and four wide and
improved position in the lane. HEAVENLY BLESSING was bumped between foes at the start, saved ground and never threatened. KICKS ON SIXTY SIX
failed to menace while racing four wide. EMIT was sawed off soon after the start, raced two wide around the turn and made little impact. SAVATIANO was
bumped at the start, raced well back two and three wide, lacked room in upper stretch and was not encouraged when clear. KING TARZAN was bumped at
the start, chased the pace four wide and came up empty.

in complete command. GANGLY raced two to three wide around the turn, and went clear for the place while never a threat to the winner. TIO WIL vied
inside the eventual winner from the start, was under a full drive struggling to keep pace after three furlongs, and weakened after a half-mile. APACHE saved
ground coming under a ride by midway on the turn, and had no rally. MOONOVERTHEBAYOU was no factor three then four wide around the turn. SANDYS

NITRO TIME set a clear pace along the rail and drew off while ridden out. MR TINGLES chased the pace two and three wide, could not keep pace with the
winner but stayed on to gain the place. C. P. A. GENIUS saved ground off the pace, angled three wide near the quarter pole and was along for the show.
EXCHANGE DAY was fractious in the gate, broke a step slow, rushed up between foes to race closest to the winner while saving ground but came up
empty in the lane. ALABAMA SLAMMER chased the pace outside, jumped for no obvious reason entering the turn and dropped back. OUR HOISTED
MAST trailed in the three path.

Footnotes
BRAMBLE BERRY was in and among horses entering the turn, began to make up ground outside COM'P after a half-mile, wrested the lead away coming to
the eighth-pole and drew off under pressure to 70 yards out. COMP'D sprinted up for the early lead inside, shook off SUNSET EMPIRE around the turn,
could not withstand the winner a furlong out, and held for the place. LET'S BE HONEST raced three wide in range for a half, and lacked the needed closing
response. SHES ALL WOMAN bobbled a couple strides away from the gate, saved ground and posed no threat. SAYONARA BABY was outrun inside.
SUNSET EMPIRE pressed COMP'D from outside to the turn, and moved out four wide fading into the lane.

Footnotes
STAR WEAVER was off a step slow, rushed up inside to set a clear pace along the rail, widened in upper stretch and held sway under left-handed urging.
SURPRISE FACTOR prompted the early pace two wide, angled in early on the turn and dropped back around the bend, tipped out in upper stretch and
rallied through the lane. UNCAGE THE CAT raced off the early pace between foes, advanced three wide around the turn, was under a tight right rein
through the lane while appearing to try to lug in and rallied outside. WILD ONE FOREVER raced well back two wide, swung out in upper stretch and rallied
belatedly widest. VALID EXCHANGE saved ground off the pace and had a mild rally inside. OUR DESTINY prompted the winner three wide down the
backstretch, two wide around the turn and was one-paced through the lane. HUSHED HIJINKS saved ground in midpack, steadied off heels near the
five-sixteenths pole, tipped two wide nearing the lane then lacked room throughout the stretch run. SOUL REFLECTION was outrun inside. BALABAN broke
slowly and made little impact while racing two wide. SAGE CANYON had brief speed outside.

Footnotes
GOLOVKIN took the lead after the start and moved inside, went along fending off advances from LORD OF WAR and MACLYRICAL for six furlongs, edged
away slightly through the furlong grounds, and dug in gamely to preserve a hard-fought decision. LORD OF WAR pressed the pace between horses from
the outset, stayed on willingly through a long drive and just missed. LUMBERJACK tucked in following behind the leaders inside, came out to the three-path
looming a threat in upper stretch, did not have enough and was able to save the show. TIZ TACT TOE raced in the two-path around the turns in the second
flight, stayed on well through the lane and was gaining gradually between horses late. SIX MINUS lagged well back despite being urged sharply
approaching the far turn, moved to the far outside for the drive and found his best stride belatedly. BIG BLUE saved ground near the back to the far turn,
steadied slightly a quarter-mile out, stayed inside for the drive and offered a mild response. BOURBON THUNDER raced three wide much of the way, and
lacked the needed bid. LOAD UP MOE trailed to the far turn, moved out four wide approaching the stretch and made no impact. SUPPLICATION raced two
to three wide around the turns, and tired in the stretch. MACLYRICAL delayed the start difficult to load, tracked outside the leaders three wide for six
furlongs, and faded through the stretch on his left lead. UNCUT GEM walked out of the gate three lengths or so behind the field, moved up four wide
through the run up the backstretch, but faltered after six furlongs.
