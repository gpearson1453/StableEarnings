QUEENS EMBRACE settled off the early pace three wide, moved up outside down the backstretch, continued three deep rounding the far turn, moved to
the front leaving the eighth pole, angled in and cleared under a drive. GET REWARDED was pulling along just off the pace while racing two wide between
rivals, bobbled a bit entering the far turn, remained bottled up around most of the turn, angled four wide near the quarter pole and rallied outside. CHARGE
ACCOUNT steadied early, raced off the pace two wide, angled out nearing the lane, was on heels in upper stretch, angled back in soon after and lacked a
clear path until deep stretch. JABUTICABA set the pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch but weakened through the final sixteenth. ZODIAC
PRINCESS pressed the pace two wide to upper stretch and faded. VITAEMI settled off the early pace inside, angled three wide midway around the far turn,
went four and five wide around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. TOWA chased the pace from the rail and came up empty in the lane. JOST SAYIN
trailed inside.

Footnotes
POWER (BRZ) trailed along the inside, advanced inside of foes under his own power into the far turn, loomed behind the leaders with five sixteenths to run,
split those foes turning for home, forged an advantage passing the furlong pole, and held sway. EXCALIBUR sat reserved off of the pace along the inside,
gained while shifting four wide passing the three furlong pole, produced a mild bid of rivals with a quarter mile to run, but failed to keep pace with them
turning for home, then chased well through the lane to claim place. MIDNIGHT WHISKEY set a pressured pace along the inside, shook clear briefly from
those pressing rivals approaching the three sixteenths pole, but was headed by the eventual winner at the furlong marker, yielded, and lost place late.
RANGER UP stalked the leading duo from the three path, bid for the lead outside of those rivals at the five sixteenths pole, but flattened out in upper stretch.
PROSPECT PROJECT saved ground from midpack along the inside, but came under coaxing passing the half mile pole, shifted off of the rail into the far
turn, but had no response and faded. MIGHTY FAST vied two wide, then from between horses as RANGER UP ranged up around the far turn, then
weakened turning for home. DUCHOSSOIS tracked from midpack two wide, but weakened three wide around the far turn. WARRANT OFFICER lied off of
the pace in the four path around the first turn, then was done early.

Footnotes
VALLETTA broke out and bumped at the start, checked not long after, raced off the pace two wide, advanced outside down the backstretch, bid three wide
nearing the lane, seized command in upper stretch, vied past the eighth pole then edged ahead under a drive. CAMELLIA GAL set the pace in the two path,
was collared by the winner in upper stretch, fought on inside but was second best late. WICKED MERCURY was pinched back at the start, lost action and
unbalanced the rider approaching the first turn, saved ground off the pace, angled out near the quarter pole and rallied for the show. OUR LITTLE JEWEL
was up close inside, became rank nearing the first turn and raced erratically in tight around that bend, continued to chase inside down the backstretch and
around the far turn and faded through the stretch. GIGGLE FACTORY prompted the pace three wide and weakened in the lane. OMNIA broke inwardly and
bumped at the start, had some speed two wide then retreated four wide around the far turn. STRIPPING was in range between foes early, checked entering
the first turn, angled out nearing the far turn and had no response.

Footnotes
SHAKEM set the pace along the inside, felt pressure from BABY LION into the turn, repelled that foe's bid entering the lane, and held sway. BABY LION
stalked two wide, inched closer to press the leader into the turn, bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but was repelled in upper stretch, and chased his inner
counterpart home. LIESEL lied far off of the pace three wide, forged show from between horses passing the half mile pole, and held that position without
threatening the leaders. METAFORA saved ground while off of the pace, but failed to factor. KETCHIKAN lied far off of the pace in the four path around the
turn, and never got involved. FAITH'S A BLUEBIRD lied forwardly placed along the inside, but faltered between horses passing the half mile pole, and was
done early.

Footnotes
GEAR JOCKEY stalked the pace from the rail, tipped out in upper stretch, bid between foes, took the lead near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a
drive. ROCHAMBEAU tracked the early pace two wide, advanced three deep around the far turn, reached near even terms near the sixteenth pole but was
outfinished. VOODOO ZIP set the pace along the rail, led to the sixteenth pole and lost second late. CORE CONVICTION came in entering the first turn,
saved ground in midpack, angled four wide nearing the quarter pole and went evenly. KING ANGELO hit the starting gate, checked entering the first turn,
saved ground off the pace and lacked the needed rally. CAVEAT EMPTOR was shuffled back nearing the first turn, raced two wide around that bend, went
four wide around most of the far turn, came six wide into the lane and never threatened. HIGH DEFF (FR) stalked the pace two wide and weakened in the
lane. MIGHTY TOUGH failed to menace while racing two wide. CARMICHAEL was off slow, raced three wide and was outrun.

PALACE COUP set the pace while gradually clearing to the rail down the backstretch, showed the way in hand around the turn, then shook clear at the
three sixteenths pole, and held sway under driving pressure through the lane. ROCKING THE BOAT stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the pace
setter as that foe shook away at the three sixteenths pole, then chased that foe through the lane while making minor progress late, but was only second
best. TURN ON THE MAGIC stalked two wide and between horses down the backstretch, but came under coaxing into the turn, then tired after being
floated three wide turning for home. GRAN OMERO (VEN) trailed early on, saved ground around the turn while passing a tiring foe, but failed to menace
therafter. SKYSCANNER tracked from midpack three wide, but faded approaching the three furlong pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
I GET IT saved ground in range, advanced inside around the far turn, tipped two wide near the quarter pole, seized command near the eighth pole and drew
off under a drive. COFFEE BUZZ BUZZ set the pace along the rail to midstretch, was no match for the winner but held well to preserve the place.
VIBURNUM settled off the pace while racing two wide, made progress four wide around the far turn, came wider into the lane and rallied for the show.
SWEET PEARL was in range three wide, bid nearing the lane but flattened out in the stretch. HADLEY saved ground well back early, advanced three wide
around the far turn, fanned eight wide into the lane and never threatened. VIKING QUEEN was rated back inside, cut the corner into the lane, moved into
third in upper stretch but failed to sustain the bid. POLISHED GEM prompted the pace two wide and tired in the drive. TERRY'S DREAM failed to menace
while racing two wide.

Footnotes
MISS ITALY lied off of the pace early on, commenced a stout rail rally into the turn, hesitated briefly while slipping inside of KIRBY at the five sixteenths
pole, sustained her impressive gain while shifting out turning for home, solidly bumped LUISANA PRINCESS at the three sixteenths marker while splitting
rivals to produce a bid, then drew off through the final furlong. TEXAS REWARD lied forwardly placed along the inside, shifted outside of the leading duo
into the turn, bid for the lead outside of FEARLESS IDEAS at the quarter pole, but was outkicked by MISS ITALY in upper stretch, then stayed on to claim
place. FEARLESS IDEAS lunged outwards at the start and bumped KIRBY, set the pace inside of that rival, then met a trio of bids turning for home, but was
headed at the furlong grounds. LUISANA PRINCESS broke outwards, stalked three to four wide, inched closer to be in range three wide at the quarter pole,
but was bumped off stride by MISS ITALY passing the three sixteenths pole, chased inner foes through upper stretch, and faded. PRETTY LIDDIE got
brushed by an inner foe at the start, lied far off of the pace in the three path around the turn, and never got involved. PANDORICA was outrun. KIRBY got
bumped by an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace two wide, but weakened at the three furlong pole and stopped.

BEE CATCHER stalked along the inside, smoothly tipped outside of the leading pair entering the lane, ranged up approaching midstretch, and drew off
through the final furlong. RELIABILITY was off a step slowly and trailed around the first turn, rallied five wide around the far turn, and sustained his charge to
reach place late. PALACE KITTEN was sent early on, cleared into the first turn, set the pace as HARDREDCANDY ranged up alongside with a half mile to
run, dug in inside of that foe and BEE CATCHER in upper stretch, got headed by the latter approaching the furlong pole, then kept on to save a minor
placing. HARDREDCANDY stalked two wide, inched forward to prompt the pace at the half mile pole, vied around the far turn, but was outkicked by the
eventual winner approaching the furlong pole, and flattened out. INDIAN COUNSELOR lied far off of the pace two wide around the turns, altered out from
behind rivals to be six wide in upper stretch, and stayed on. STRIKE THE TOP tracked from midpack two to three wide around the turns, failed to keep pace
with inner foes around the far turn, cut the corner turning for home to improve position, but failed to make an impact. SOUTH POINTE DRIVE saved ground
while off of the pace, but to no avail. AUBURN HILLS lied off of the pace in the two to three path around the first turn, attempted a four wide rally around the
far turn, but failed to factor. CALL BROS stalked three wide, but weakened between horses turning for home. AHNAF and. ALEJANDRO'S TEAM were
outrun.
