Footnotes
MUCH ABOUT IT showed speed then tracked the pace on the outside, went around the turn in the three path, made a bid in the four path into the stretch
then took the lead at the three-sixteenths, responded well under a right-handed whip in the final furlong, swapped back to her inside lead at the
sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. SWORN SILENCE settled on the outside, was taken under a strong hold as the pace slackened nearing the
half-mile pole, went three wide while let out just a notch on the turn, moved out while put to a drive in upper stretch, rallied to make a bid into the final
sixteenth but couldn't get by the winner while able to get the place. SHILAH BABY was backed out of the gate then reloaded, came away in good order and
went straight to the lead, set the clear pace, went around the turn in the two path, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive in upper
stretch, fought on into the final furlong then was outfinished while able to get the show. SOUTHERN DUDETTE was coaxed along on the outside, chased
four wide on the turn then came five wide into the stretch, pursued the vanguard under a drive and lacked the needed kick. MELODY ROSE was fractious in
the gate, raced under some urging towards the rear early, was taken under a vigorous hold behind horses coming to the half-mile pole, went around the turn
in the two path, was asked at the three-eighths, swung four wide into the stretch then moved out a bit more, dropped in inside the three-sixteenths and
lacked the needed response. KENAI COOL was coaxed along off the pace, dropped back under urging while saving ground on the turn and came up empty.
ALTERED DREAM hit the outside of the gate at the start and was off a step slow, angled in early then moved up under restraint nearing the half-mile pole,
was roused in the two path on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
DREAMING OF CARATS went straight to the front then accelerated clear, drew off under some restraint while inside to the two path, opened up a huge
advantage onto the backstretch, maintained that advantage through the far turn, was put to the whip in upper stretch, began to drift out under a left-handed
whip outside the sixteenth-pole, continued to drift out when switched to a right-handed whip then wandered about nearing the wire while remaining well clear
in victory. GOLD ACCOUNT was bumped hard between horses at the start then dropped back, went three then four wide on the first turn, moved in nearing
the five-eighths pole, raced inside under urging early on the far turn, shifted three then four wide outside the five-sixteenths, floated five wide into upper
stretch then drifted out around the three-sixteenths and secured the place. PHARAOH'S KITTEN bumped hard with a rival at the start, went around the first
turn in the two path, settled in second position while far behind the runaway leader, was ridden along in the three path on the far turn and lacked the needed
response while best of the rest. O'CONNOR broke a step slow, had his left front foreleg clip the right hind leg of MY SUGAR TOWN early and bobbled, went
four then five wide on the first turn, raced near the back, was ridden along passing the half-mile pole, rounded the far turn in the two path and was no factor.
MY SUGAR TOWN bumped with a rival at the start, had O'CONNOR clip his heels early, went three wide on the first turn, settled in third position on the
outside, was hard ridden while four then five wide on the far turn and failed to respond. BAYANDBUNNY saved ground near the back, shifted three wide
outside the five-sixteenths and showed little.

Footnotes
CITALI went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, moved from the two path to the three path while in dead aim of the leading trio on the
far turn, rallied six wide into the stretch then took the lead at the three-sixteenths, battled outside of the runner-up in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed
under strong urging. HALF TRICK went two to three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the inside of a rival, made a bid between horses in the two
path on the far turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, battled gamely with the winner in the final furlong and just missed while clear for the place. BYE
BYE SHANGHAI saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was roused three then four wide on the far turn then driven five wide into the stretch,
moved out under a drive near the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. GATO AMERICANO went three to four wide on the
first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid outside of two foes in the three path on the far turn, gained a short lead passing the five-sixteenths,
was asked for his best in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. DICTATOR was well rated while setting the pace on the inside, came
under heavy pressure inside of two foes on the far turn, lost the advantage at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under the whip and gave way.
RIVER EVANGELIST was hustled from the start, went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, dropped
back four then five wide early on the far turn, dropped to the three then two path late on that bend and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but
walked off.

Footnotes
CABO'S RUMOR went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, rallied four wide on the far turn, closed fast while five wide into the stretch, gained
the lead in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths, battled outside of WAR COUNT into the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. MUSICAL MAN
saved ground on the first turn, moved out early on the backstretch, bumped soundly with a foe around the five-eighths, was rated off the pace, tugged hard
on the bit passing the half-mile pole, went two to three wide while let out on the far turn, shifted four wide into the stretch then quickly moved out six wide,
rallied outside in the final furlong and gained with good courage to get the place at the wire. WAR COUNT raced inside early on the first turn then shifted
three wide, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the far turn, drew even for the lead at the five-sixteenths, fought with the winner into
the final sixteenth and was outfinished then lost the place at the wire but was clear for the show. GREELEY WENT WEST went three wide on the first turn,
was well placed down the backstretch, came under some urging while inside on the far turn, was put to a drive while moving off the rail into upper stretch
and lacked the needed response. IM A COWBOY TOO went to the front, set the pace in the two path, was asked under heavy threat on the far turn,
dropped back in upper stretch and tired. KINGDOM WAY broke out and a step slow, went four wide on the first turn, bumped soundly with a rival near the
five-eighths, settled at the back on the outside, was urged three to four wide on the far turn and failed to respond.

marker and drew clear under strong urging. WATRUGONNADOKAREN went four to five wide on the first turn, moved up early on the backstretch then
tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid with three furlongs to run, vied in the three path under urging on the far turn, took the lead outside the
three-sixteenths, lost the advantage under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while able to hold the place. KATIE'S KARAT went three wide
on the first turn, settled near the back, was urged along while two to three wide on the far turn, gained into upper stretch then moved out under a drive
around the furlong marker and missed the place while well clear for the show. MAD TABBY went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was
ridden along while four wide on the far turn then carried out near the furlong marker and came up empty. BUSINESS LADY went to the front, raced in the
two to three path on the first turn, set the pace, was asked while inside on the far turn, lost the advantage outside the three-sixteenths, dropped back under
a drive into upper stretch and tired. BLUE XCHANGE went four to five wide on the turns and was no factor. MY LITTLE GUERA brushed with a rival at the
start, became very rank when taken under restraint early, went around the first turn in the two path, was urged along on the backstretch, went two to three
wide under strong urging on the far turn and was no factor. TALENTED TAPPER went three to four wide on the first turn, moved up early on the backstretch
to prompt the pace, came up empty in the two path on the far turn and retreated then was eased in the final furlong but walked off. BABY MAYBE brushed
with an opponent at the start, went three wide on the first turn, drifted out midway down the backstretch and faltered then was also eased in the final furlong
