HEADLINE HUNTER well handled from between horses to the turn, roused through the stretch, prevailed. DELTA GAMMA CATS wide speed,, chased to
stretch, drifted out, gamely to wire. SHASTALOO never far back to the stretch, leveled off in the drive for show. SPY A STAR no speed to the stretch,
improved position down the lane late. DOUBLE DAWN close up early on, faded back after the half. REGAL SONG inside run to quarter pole, faltered in the
stretch run. BOOTS N' JEANS squeezed back start, never a threat. ZEBRA CAKE off rail speed to the turn, gave way readily. GET CLEAR never a factor.
GOODBYE GREELEY brief speed from inside, used up, gave way readily.
