pole, gave chase into the backstretch then dueled through the stretch for second. PARTLY DANDY broke awkwardly and was boxed in at the rail midway on
the opening turn, eased out into the backstretch and bid toward the three eighths pole, then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. CREATIVE
SPLENDOR broke awkwardly then saved ground the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but was never a threat. CHOPRA raced

Footnotes
GANDHI'S CASTLE took over leaving the chute and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure past the five sixteenths pole, widened at the
rail through the turn and was kept alert down the lane. BASKET GIRL chased the pace through the backstretch, entered the turn about the five path, lost
some ground through the turn and entered the stretch in the seven path then dug in to take second mid-stretch. QUITE SUGGESTIVE chased the pace and
rounded the turn about the four path, drifted a bit into the lane and showed little further. QUICK ENERGY chased the pace and was eased to the four path
on the turn, then passed rivals down the lane. QUEEN OF ANYTHING chased the pace through the backstretch, lost ground on the turn and entered the
stretch about the six path, then passed rivals in the lane. FLIRTING FUHR AVIE saved ground racing well back. NATURAL SONDE came away sharply and
gave close early chase, but dropped back through the turn and weakened. SWISS THUNDER chased through the backstretch then weakened at the rail
rounding the turn. BECOMING MACHEN gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn and weakened.
