Footnotes
SOUPER ENERGIZER prompted the pace two wide, vied between horses around the far turn, drew off in upper stretch, and held sway under driving
pressure until the late stages. JEALOUS EYES tracked from midpack while caught in the four path around the first turn, advanced to stalking position in the
three path into the far turn, inched closer while shifting back to the four path around that bend, then sustained his grinding rally to reach place late.
MAGICAL CAUSE stalked four wide around the first turn, bid for the lead three wide around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with an inner rival in upper
stretch, then lost place late. SHANANIES PAYNTER saved ground far off of the pace around the first turn, took the far turn in the three path before shifting
to the four, then five, path in upper stretch, and improved position through the final furlong. CALABASH stalked along the inside, but faded and lost position
into the far turn, then came again mildly between horses through the late stages. BEYOND THE CALL lied forwardly placed three wide and between horses
around the first turn, chased the leading trio from the two path around the far turn, then faded. GUN OF GLORY set the pace along the inside, then inside of
a pair of rivals around the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch. REINOANIMAUX lied off of the pace in the two path, got keen into the first turn but settled
after a few strides, then took the far turn in the three path and failed to rally. SAFE AND SOUND trailed the field two wide, and was outrun. SOUPER BEST
BET lied far off of the pace in the three path around the first turn, and was outrun thereafter.

THINK IT THRU vied two wide between rivals down the backstretch, drew clear near the five-sixteenths pole and drew off under moderate urging through
the lane. TWIN BRIDGES prompted the pace three wide, could not keep pace with the winner nearing the lane but stayed on to save the place. NAVAL
WAVE stalked the pace three wide and lacked a rally. PISCES saved ground off the pace, angled out near the quarter pole and never threatened. NORA
RADD vied inside of the winner early, checked near the five-sixteenths pole and had no further response. MIRACULOUS played no factor while racing two
and three wide. BRODY'S HONOR was outrun while racing two wide. DOES SHE KNOW was reluctant to load and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
JOSEFA set the pace along the inside, shook clear from pressing foes in upper stretch, drifted out many paths through the final furlong while maintaining
her margin, and held sway. ALL ABOUT KATHERN brushed the railing into the first turn while achieving inside stalking position, tracked around the far turn
before shifting outside of the leading duo turning for home, but only made minor progress on the pace setter's advantage, flopped back to her left lead inside
the furlong pole, and sustained her grind to secure place. LITTLE BIT GOOD received bumps on both sides while in tight quarters between horses into the
first turn, took back to be off of the pace in the two path around that bend, saved ground around the far turn, then improved position along the rail through
the lane. STAR SWEPT prompted the pace while shifting four to two wide into the first turn, held vying position around the far turn, but failed to keep pace
with her inner counterpart in upper stretch, and tired. QUEEN FIELD trailed early on, took both turns in the two path while far off of the pace, and improved
mildly. STEFANIE ON FLEEK achieved stalking position under a snug hold while shifting from the five path to the three path into the first turn, but came
under urging into the far turn, lacked a response, and faded turning for home. HENNI PENNY took back from between rivals without incident into the first
turn, tracked from off of the pace while staying in the five path and a path away from rivals around both turns, and never got involved. SUBTLE JOY lied off
of the pace in the three path around the first turn, and was outrun.

Footnotes
TABOR HALL set the pace in the two path, kicked clear in upper stretch and held clear under left-handed urging. CARAMEL SWIRL pressed the winner in
the three path and could not get to the winner in the lane while holding well clear of the rest. BOW BOW GIRL stumbled then was bumped at the start, raced
well back inside, made progress three wide early on the far turn, angled back to the rail near the five-sixteenths pole and was along for the show. BEST
CAUSE never threatened while racing two and three wide. TAYET chased the top two four wide and came up empty in the lane. LUNAR BLAST was outrun
inside. SKYBOX had brief speed inside. UNBRIDLED D'ORO was bumped at the start, raced four and five wide and made little impact.

Footnotes
SLUMBER PARTY set the pace from the onset, opened up on the field with five furlongs to run, held a wide lead around the turn, widened that advantage
under mild urging through midstretch, and was geared down late. PASS THE CHAMPAGNE was off slowly, steadied while running up on heels at the five
furlong pole, settled off of the pace while saving ground around the bend, split foes two wide passing the quarter pole to commence a rally, altered to the
four path in upper stretch, then rallied to just reach place at the wire while no threat to the leader. TEMPER MINT TWIST lied forwardly placed, chased from
the four path around the turn, forged place at the five sixteenths pole while proving no match for the leader, chased that foe through the lane without making
progress, then got nailed on the wire by PASS THE CHAMPAGNE. PHAROAH'S BELLE lied close up along the inside early on, but faded down the
backstretch despite mild rider encouragement, faltered through the field to be far off of the pace along the inside into the turn, saved ground around the
bend, then stayed on well through the lane to rally for a minor placing. SWEET PENELOPE was held up inside of PHAROAH'S BELL without racing room to
achieve early position, slipped inside of that foe when that one faltered to achieve stalking position into the turn, saved ground around the bend, but tired
through the lane. UNSHAKABLE U broke inwards, advanced to midpack two wide and between horses into the turn, got floated four wide turning for home,
and failed to menace. COPACETIC tracked from midpack in the four path, but drifted to the seven path turning for home before weakening. BELLE ELLE
lied far off of the pace three wide into the turn, and improved. THE JOKES ON ME lied far off of of the pace in the two path around the turn and never got
involved. LEGENDARY GIFT pressed two wide, but came under coaxing to keep pace with the leader at the half mile pole, failed to do so, chased from the
three path around the turn, but weakened passing the five sixteenths pole. VIDA YELLOW faded in the five path around the turn, and weakened. LUCKY US
lied far off of the pace two wide around the turn, and never got involved.

Footnotes
KING OTTOKAR pressed the pace two wide, took the lead between foes near the five-sixteenths marker, battled to midstretch, briefly cleared leaving the
eighth pole then just lasted under a drive. DILIGENT stalked the pace inside, angled out nearing the lane, got through in upper stretch, finished well and just
missed. MONTAUK SUMMER got out entering the first turn, raced four wide in midpack around both turns, and rallied through the lane. SHARETHEBLAME
raced off the pace two and three wide, angled further out in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. EMOJI GUY veered out at the start, moved up to stalk the
pace three wide around the first turn and went evenly from there. WHERE YA GOIN OWEN set the pace along the rail under pressure from the winner,
fought on to midstretch and weakened through the final furlong. MAVERICK KITTEN angled five wide entering the first turn, made progress widest, bid three
wide around the far turn and faded in the lane. BAD BOY E. J. was in tight at the start, saved ground and never threatened. RIGGINS failed to menace while
racing three and four wide. EL SOLITARIO was outrun inside.

Footnotes
MYSTICAL MOON tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted four wide in upper stretch, rallied to bid for the lead at the sixteenth pole, and prevailed.
DOCTOR D J rallied in the five path around the turn, sustained his charge to bid approaching the wire, but missed. LONG GRAY LINE lied off of the pace
four wide, gained under urging into the turn to a three wide stalking position, kept on under a long drive through the lane to bid for the lead at the sixteenth
pole, but was outfinished by outer foes. SO LONG CHUCK stalked three wide, bid for the lead outside of POWERFUL ALLY at the three furlong pole, vied
with that foe turning for home, but gave way to him in upper stretch, then kept on to surpass him in the late stages for a minor share. POWERFUL ALLY
vied two wide, cleared his inner counterpart into the turn, shook clear from pressing foes in upper stretch, but tired in the final furlong and weakened after
being headed at the sixteenth marker. TRAPPEZOID pulled early on to an inside stalking position, took the turn in the two path, then chased the leaders
turning for home before fading. FIRST AND THREE lied far off of the pace, advanced mildly in the three to six path around the turn, but failed to factor.
DEXTER ROAD tracked from midpack in the three to four path around the turn, but faded. COWBOY'S HERO saved ground far off of the pace, tipped two
wide at the quarter pole, and failed to factor. STARSHIP ARAMIS rushed to vie inside of POWERFUL ALLY leaving the chute, but weakened into the turn,
and subsequently stopped. SMASH tracked from midpack two wide early on, but was through after a half mile.

Footnotes
JOY OF PAINTING led early, settled off the runaway pacesetter midway around the first turn, re-bid two wide into the far turn, seized command near the
five-sixteenths pole, cleared off and held firm under a drive. NO ORDINARY TIME was washy pre-race, raced off the pace three wide, advanced four wide
around the far turn, could not seriously gain on the winner in the lane but finished willingly to hold off several foes for the place. SALIT was bumped at the
start, lagged well back in the two path, advanced four wide around the far turn and rallied through the lane to gain the show. BRINA was a bit erratic while
racing well back entering the first turn, raced two wide around that bend, went five deep rounding the far turn, bid outside in upper stretch and flattened out a
bit in the final furlong. SEMBLE JUSTE (IRE) saved ground in midpack, tipped out nearing the lane and had a mild gain between foes. EARNESTINE N
HAZEL (IRE) failed to menace while racing three wide. PHENOMENAL WOMAN played no factor while racing three wide. ZIA'S SONG tracked the pace
three wide for seven furlongs and faded late. RICHEBOURG broke out and bumped SALIT at the start, raced two wide and made little impact. SCARLETT
LACE settled off the early pace two wide, made a three wide bid midway around the far turn and wilted in the lane. EXCEPT TEMPTATION hit the starting
gate, raced well back inside, swung widest nearing the eighth pole and lacked the needed rally. RAINBOW BELLE was very reluctant to load, set a clear
pace and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
ROYAL MEGHAN vied along the inside of OVER GATORS early on, allowed that foe to clear off into the turn, rebid for the lead along with BARGAINAIRE
at the five sixteenths pole, shook off that foe in upper stretch, drew off, and was geared down late. BARGAINAIRE stalked three wide, bid for the lead
outside of ROYAL MEGHAN at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to match strides with that foe in upper stretch, and proved second best. ADDILYN lied far
off of the pace in the two path into the turn, swung five wide turning for home, and stayed on for a minor share. BIRD MAP chased four wide, shifted down to
the three path turning for home, and failed to threaten. FOREVER MARTA saved ground far off of the pace, came into the lane two wide to pass the early
pace setter, and failed to menace. BRAMBLE BERRY bumped the gate, lied off of the pace in the three path around the turn, and never got involved. NO
BULL JACK lacked early speed, took the turn in the four path, and failed to factor. OVER GATORS set the pace outside ROYAL MEGHAN early on, cleared
that foe into the turn, but was headed by that foe and another rival at the five sixteenths pole, weakened, and stopped. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION,
THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED. THE FIVE FURLONG FRACTION IS UNAVAILABLE

Footnotes
RICHIES GREAT GIRL stalked the pace two wide, bid three wide in upper stretch, seized command near the eighth pole and powered clear while drifting
out a bit under right-handed urging. AWSUM ROAR settled off the pace at the rail, angled four wide turning for home and finished willingly. MY SASSY
SARAH lacked early speed, raced two wide around the turn and was along for the show. OUR LITTLE DEVIL dueled two wide to the eighth pole and
weakened. TWIRLING STAR raced well back two wide, swung out near the thee-sixteenths pole and lacked a rally. ERV'S WENCH was outrun inside.
CAPTAIN SAM steadied leaving the three-eighths pole, raced four wide around the turn and never threatened. ALEXANDRA KAY dueled along the rail to
midstretch and tired. COIN THE PHRASE chased the pace three wide and retreated through the lane. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED AND THE
FRACTIONS WERE UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
ALL GOOD stalked along the inside, tipped three wide turning for home to produce a bid, forged an advantage in upper stretch, dueled as his inner
counterpart dug in, prevailed in the battle and just held off ZIPALONG late. ZIPALONG saved ground far off of the pace around the first turn, gained three to
four wide around the far turn, then rallied on his left lead through the lane to produce a late bid, but just missed. MR. AXEL stalked two wide, vied around the
far turn before forging an advantage at the quarter pole, but was headed by ALL GOOD turning for home, dueled gamely inside of that foe through the lane,
but was outfinished. BURLY BOY saved ground from midpack, split foes two wide in midstretch, and stayed on for a minor share. MITZRAYIM was reluctant
to load, got guided down to the two path while midpack into the first turn, then chased the leaders from between horses through the lane without producing a
bid. EL PILLO lied forwardly placed three wide, chased the leaders through upper stretch, and faded. ALRAHAAL lied far off of the pace two to four wide
around the turns, swung to the seven path turning for home, and improved position. THENORTHREMEMBERS lied well off of the pace three to four wide
around the turns, and failed to make an impact. YADI lied far off of the pace along the inside, and never got involved. STRONG HEADED lied off of the pace
three wide, came under a drive while shifting four wide into the far turn, came into the lane five wide, and faded. MR TITO'S trailed early on, and never got
involved. ALASTOR set the pace along the inside, but was headed at the quarter pole, weakened turning for home, and stopped. DUE TO A TIMER
MALFUNCTION, THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED. INTERNAL FRACTIONS ARE UNAVAILABLE.
