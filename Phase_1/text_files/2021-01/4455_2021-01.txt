CAUSE OF LOVE pressed the pace two wide around the clubhouse turn, made the lead, set the balance of the pace and finished full of run to win as much
the best under a hand ride. SKIPSHOT LILLY stalked the pace for a half, moved up in the four path on the far turn, chased the winner and held on for
second. OHIO STORM was bothered at the start, well placed and finished with good courage. WACKER'S GIRL was no factor and swung wide. LOOSE IN
PARADISE well placed, failed to respond. CRYPTO'S TWIN MILL bore out at the start and was outrun. LEMON SLUSH set the early pace near the inside
and stopped on the far turn.

Footnotes
AIKEN APPLE stalked the early pace two wide, rallied to make the lead entering the far turn, quickly shook clear, set the balance of the pace along the
inside and just lasted under left handed urging. QUEEN HIGH never far back, closed willingly in the five path through the stretch, drifted in late and just
missed. JUDGE REESE unhurried early, swung wide and rallied steadily through the stretch narrowly missing three wide. ALL THE BEST slow early, found
her best stride late in the five path. ISLAND CHIC with the second flight, finished with good courage in the three path. BEACH BABE battled for the early
lead along the inside, remained a sharp threat into the far turn then faded. ENDURING LOVE was outrun. PINK HALDER moved up three wide into the
second turn then came up empty. HELLS BELLS HELEN set the early pace and folded on the far turn. BAINBRIDGE stumbled at the start, had her saddle
slip, had speed for a half then stopped.

Footnotes
CAN U HANDLE THIS made the lead soon after the start, set the pace into the turn, was headed by the runner-up, fought back gamely along the rail
through deep stretch and got back up in time. SUN DRESS pressed the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead before the quarter pole, battled until
deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner. COUNTRY ASSETS slow early, swung wide and closed a gap late in the seven path. LOW TIRE failed to
menace. BLACK BUTTE with the second flight four wide, lacked the needed response. LORETTAS SONG vied for the lead along the inside and faded in
the final furlong. TEATOE was no factor. PROUD MAID MARIAN was through early. MANCORA was a sharp threat four wide into the turn then gave way.
ISTAN ROSE bobbled at the start, had speed along the inside into the stretch then flattened out.

Footnotes
CAZMAN prompted the pace into the turn, drew even two wide, drifted in a bit bumping NO TREBEL at the furlong marker, was righted and prevailed under
confident handling. LIGHTNING JACK never far back, dug in three wide through the final furlong and got up for second. NO TREBLE away alertly, the pace
into the turn, was headed before a half, bumped while along the rail a furlong out then was outfinished. DISCIPLE went evenly. YESUS STAR failed to
menace. ANYWHERE ROAD passed tiring rivals in the eight path through the stretch. SAN RULER trailed, swung wide and also passed tiring rivals.
LOCAL HONEY was outrun. KISS YOUR BRIDE was no factor. TRAP had brief speed. GRANDPA JIM close up along the rail, checked and clipped heels at
the quarter, stumbled pole and dropped out of it. TRULY OBLIGATO had speed along the inside, had his heels clipped at the quarter pole then stopped.
