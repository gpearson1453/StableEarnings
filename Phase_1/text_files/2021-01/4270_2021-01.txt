CHUB ON DA RUN vied along the inside, moved clear on the turn then edged away under moderate pressure. GHOST FIGHTER settled inside off the
leaders, rallied into the stretch but proved no match for the winner. GREENBACK chased three wide off the pace and flattened out through the stretch.
MACLEAN'S LEGACY dueled outside to the turn and weakened steadily. BUCKS ARE MOVING broke slowly and ducked in, bid three wide then gave way.

PETULANT DELIGHT vied three wide for the early lead, then two wide, dueled with CASTLE CASANOVA, shook free from that rival on the far turn and
kicked clear under urging. SEAT OF HONOR raced off the pace inside, moved up four wide midway on the far turn, went five wide past the quarter pole,
rallied outside in the stretch run and was up for second. NILEATOR stalked close up three wide, chased three wide on the far turn, rallied and lost second
late. THE ROBERT was off slowly, outrun early and closed belatedly outside. WOODBURY raced three wide early, then stalked four wide, chased four wide
on the far turn and weakened. TERRY'S CHARM stalked between rivals, chased on the far turn and tired. SOLAR WARMING vied inside for the early lead,
then tracked inside and faded. CASTLE CASANOVA vied two wide early, then vied inside for command, dueled into the far turn and faded. PROMISE

Footnotes
DREAMS UNTOLD stalked the leader outside, took over after half a mile, quickly pulled away under moderate coaxing. IRISH CORK settled far behind,
advanced on the final turn then closed well to be easily second best. RUBY BLEU raced close up outside then flattened out through the stretch.
SPLICETHEMAINBRACE hustled to the lead inside, was collared after half a mile and faded. LATE BREAKING NEWS moved closer inside into far turn,
was taken up sharply and faded. ADMIRAL ABE raced close up between rivals to the final turn and gave way. JUMP FOR ALEX was taken up inside
entering the backstretch then had no further response. A stewards inquiry into the incident at the far turn resulted in no change in the order of finish.
