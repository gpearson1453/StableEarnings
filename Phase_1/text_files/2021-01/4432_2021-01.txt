Footnotes
RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW took immediate control to rate the pace, was met into the backstretch then pressured toward the three eighths pole, widened on
the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. CHARITABLE ROSE raced off the early pace inside, picked up the chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, then dug in to take second inside the eighth pole. LADY'S CORK settled off the pace in the two and
three paths, bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn then ceded second in the stretch duel. PROCIDANA stalked two
deep and moved to even terms leaving the half mile pole, engaged in close chase through the backstretch but dropped back midway on the far turn and
weakened. IRMA GIRL raced in the three path the first turn then stalked into the backstretch, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded
the far turn still in the three path then flattened out. MEEMAW'S HEART rounded the opening turn about the four path and raced outside into the
backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though, faded in the five path of the far turn and was not encouraged in the stretch.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN SAVIOUR settled off the pace two deep the first turn, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the five path,
dug in for the lead later yards and raced clear under the wire. WIDGET FACTORY took the lead at the rail into the first turn, was met toward the nine
sixteenths pole and dueled from the three eighths, raced at even terms nearest the rail rounding the far turn, took the edge approaching the head of the lane
and drew clear past the eighth pole, dug in under steady encouragement, but was caught in later yards. DEPUTY DREW raced well back from early
contention while saving ground, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, steadily improved to take third later yards and finished well. ASTRO RIDER
saved early ground then eased out into the backstretch, bid from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the six path of the far turn and just missed third while
finishing well. G MAN stalked the early pace, took the lead nearing the nine sixteenths pole and came under pressure at the three eighths, raced at even
terms two deep on the far turn but dropped back at the eighth pole and flattened stride the final sixteenth. WALLET saved ground off the pace, picked up the
chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then weakened. R BOY EVENS broke a bit awkwardly then stalked three wide early,
gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the four path of the far turn. COMPROMISO was through early and not asked the final quarter
mile.

LA RUFINA chased the pace inside and raced at the rail on the turn, eased just outside the early leader leaving the turn, dug in to take over later yards and
raced clear at the wire. ONE SMART COOKIE chased the pace toward the outside, raced in the six path of the turn and dug in to take second the final
stride. KENS LADY angled in to rate the pace off the rail, came under pressure midway on the turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but was
caught in later yards, reluctantly ceded and was nipped from second the final stride. SINGLE MOM chased outside and raced in the six path of the turn,
steadily progressed through the lane and finished well. COOL ENOUGH chased, rounded the turn at the rail then flattened stride inside the eighth pole.
ANCHORETTE broke in the air and veered to the outside leaving the chute, came back to the inside and gave only distant chase. SUPER WILDCAT
chased from the three and four paths, raced close most of the turn then weakened.

Footnotes
BELLY FLOP rounded the opening turn in the four path and settled off the pace from the seven eighths pole, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole,
took the lead two deep midway on the far turn and raced clear under steady handling mid-stretch. FLICKER'S PRINCESS rated a slim early lead, was
caught at the three quarter pole and stalked from that point, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths to recover the advantage nearing the three eighths,
was caught at the rail midway on the far turn, continued close to mid-stretch then flattened stride. RICH IMAGE rated close to the early pace, gave chase
nearing the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn in the three path, then ran evenly to mid-stretch before flattening stride. BOTTLE COURAGE
raced well off the early pace saving ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path but flattened stride in the lane. NOR PER
OURS rounded the first turn in the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the
six path and passed rivals outside. UNEXPECTEDLY raced in the five path the first turn, was well off the pace into the backstretch and showed little
response. LWF DRIVE BYE GAL stalked the early pace in the four path and took the lead nearing the three quarter pole, rated inside from that point but
was caught approaching the three eighths pole and faded on the far turn. BORROWED ANGEL rated close about the three path, picked up the chase
toward the seven sixteenths pole, though, faded approaching the far turn. ALL EYES ON ME was through after a half mile.

Footnotes
APPROVETHISMESSAGE stalked the earlier pace in the three and four paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took aim three wide into the far turn,
dug in from the head of the lane and took the nod the final yards. STORMY LEO set the early pace off the rail but was caught leaving the five eighths pole,
picked up the chase toward the three eighths and recovered the edge two deep while between horses midway on the far turn, dug in gamely through the
stretch but grudgingly yielded the nod through the final yards. EXPECT DRAMA took the lead in the four path past the five eighths pole and rated the pace,
came under pressure nearing the three eighths, gave up the lead at the rail midway on the far turn then flattened in the lane. SHOTMASTER saved ground
the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and finished evenly.
SHAFT OF LIGHT raced in the five path the first turn and stalked into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened stride
about the four path of the far turn. BAY HILL raced well off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in
the five path and showed little more. W V ROCKET MAN stalked two deep while between horses early, chased from the seven sixteenths pole but faded at
the rail approaching the far turn. WHISKEY CREEK came out a step slow and never factored. ICE KAUFY saved ground close to the early pace then
showed little response through the backstretch.

JUST GO WITH IT broke out to make contact with Holy Boly then picked up the chase off the rail, dug in leaving the turn and got up the final yards. U S S
COSTLY rated the pace through the backstretch and rounded the turn at the rail, dug in under steady stretch encouragement, but was caught in the final
yards. HOLY BOLY was bumped outward and into More Please leaving the gate then gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail,
angled four wide into the stretch and closed well to gain on the runner-up. MORE PLEASE was bumped then pinched back on the chute and picked up the
chase through the backstretch, came through the far turn about the four path and passed a rival in the lane. RICHIE'S B L chased, raced off the rail on the
turn then flattened stride. WHAT ABOUT SHORTY gave chase and raced in the five path of the turn. THE BOOK OF ROD broke inward, picked up the
chase and rounded the turn off the rail. ZUMWALT gave only distant chase.
