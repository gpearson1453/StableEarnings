Footnotes
MOONLIGHT DANCING worked a good trip tracking off rail, nice three wide bid to the quarter pole, sustained the run and cleared off late in a good effort.
OSPREY COURT had a tardy start, rushed to contend, rallied stretch while no match for the winner. RONAN no speed to far turn, rallied along for the show
spot. TOUCH OF BLESSING raced outside most of way, rallied wide for minor share in the late going. BRILLIANT PATINA pressed leader to far turn but,
leveled off into the stretch run. CRYPTO CAT raced a wide trip to improve position from the turn. HEADLINE KITTEN sharp speed from rail, led to quarter
pole and gave way inside. AMARIN broke thru gate prestart, reloaded and never menaced. SMARTY ARTIE trailed to far turn and only passed tired ones
late. PRETTYFUNNYHONEY was through early and dropped back readily. STORM THE SAZERAC raced evenly to far turn, stayed in good position with no
late kick. MUSIC CITY WOLF raced in good position to far turn but dropped back readily.

and faded back. LUCRESSIA never threatened throughout. EIDA'S STORM tracked off rail to far turn, weakened in the drive. KITTENAIRE never a
menace. CUPP OF CLASS good position to the half, gave way readily. CHARLO through after half, gave way with little resistance.
