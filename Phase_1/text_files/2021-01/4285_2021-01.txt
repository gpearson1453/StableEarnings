and powered clear under left-handed urging. ALL ABOUT KATHERN saved ground under a firm hold just behind the pace, tipped out nearing the lane, took
the lead two wide in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth pole but was overpowered by the winner. LOVELY BROWN stalked the pace two wide, took the lead
leaving the three-eighths pole, led to upper stretch and weakened. HELENA BEAT saved ground off the pace and lacked a serious rally. CALENTITA (IRE)
failed to menace while racing two and three wide. MONEY FACTOR raced three wide in midpack, bid three deep nearing the far turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
KHOZZY VALINTINE saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the two path to pass a tiring rival in upper stretch, then sustained a grinding rally inside of
rivals through the lane to reach the leader inside the final sixteenth. IZSHEFROSTED dueled for the lead outside of FIOR DI LATTE, drew clear from that
foe turning for home, but tired in the final furlong and was bested by an inner rallying rival in the late stages. NUSCAA stalked the leading duelers from the
three path, came under urging into the turn to inch closer, did so mildly, but leveled off turning for home, then sustained a grind through the lane outside of
the leader as that foe tired, but was outfinished by an inner foe through the late stages. NANCY WORK trailed early on, advanced mildly while under a stiff
drive in the four path around the turn, but flattened out in upper stretch. FIOR DI LATTE dueled for the lead inside of IZSHEFROSTED, but gave way to that
rival passing the quarter pole, and weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
IDEAL BREEZE set the pace, drew clear under no encouragement into the turn, then widened under driving pressure in upper stretch before being hand
ridden through the final sixteenth. PLAYERA chased the leader two wide into the turn, proved no match for that rival around the bend, and was second best
while staying well clear of show through the lane. DIVINE ENCOUNTER vied along the inside early on, but lost position and faltered back to midpack into
the turn, saved ground around the bend, then improved past a tiring foe for a minor share in midstretch. NEVER MY LOVE hopped at the start, recovered to
chase the clear leader three wide, but weakened turning for home. MARY OF SCOTLAND lied far off of the pace three wide around the turn, and never got
involved. BODE'S PRINCESS was outrun, and showed little.

Footnotes
NINJA DUST raced off the pace two wide around the first turn, moved up widest down the backstretch, rallied three wide around the far turn, closed four
wide through the lane, seized command leaving the eighth pole, battled outside of DIGITAL FOOTPRINT to the wire and prevailed. DIGITAL FOOTPRINT
saved ground in midpack, waited for room while racing two wide around the far turn, came through a narrow opening in upper stretch, reached near even
terms in midstretch, fought on inside of the winner and was narrowly outfinished. CAIRO CAMPAIGN stalked the pace two wide, took the lead in upper
stretch, continued on the left lead, led past the eighth pole and was outfinished by the top two. PRETENDANT saved ground off the pace, move dup three
wide around the far turn and rallied outside. GEOGRAPHY saved ground and lacked the needed rally. BEINFUN set the pace along the rail, was collared in
upper stretch and weakened. ATAKAN chased the pace two wide, steadied when in a bit tight nearing the quarter pole and lacked a further bid. CALAMITY
KAT took a bad step leaving the half-mile pole, was pulled up soon after and vanned off.

Footnotes
BLACK MAGIC WOMAN showed the way through a slow pace while in hand three wide, shifted down two wide into the turn as SEASIDE RETREAT moved
up to vie along the rail, maintained a narrow margin from that foe around the bend, then drew clear in upper stretch, and was ridden out to the wire under
hand urging. FAVORITE SIN stalked along the inside, shifted off of the rail into the turn, split foes while tipping to the three path passing the three furlong
pole to pursue the leading pair, ranged up alongside those rivals turning for home, but failed to match strides with the eventual winner, and proved second
best. SEASIDE RETREAT lied close up two wide and between horses early on, got sent decisively inside of the pace setter at the three furlong pole, vied
for the lead around the bend while under steady urging, then gave way in upper stretch. RUNAWAY MOM trailed along the inside, split tiring foes while
shifting to the three path at the five sixteenths pole, then stayed on while failing to threaten. COZY CAFE bumped with an outer foe at the start, vied along
the inside through the slow early pace, but weakened passing the three furlong pole, and was eased through the lane. KISS THEORY bobbled and bumped
an inner foe at the start, recovered to stalk the slow pace three wide, but weakened into the turn, and was eased through the lane. DUE TO A TIMER
MALFUNCTION, THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED, THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION IS UNAVAILABLE

GOLDEN CURL set a clear pace while racing a bit off the rail, opened up in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. I'M LISTENING saved ground under
restraint in midpack, was shuffled back some nearing the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and rallied outside. BAREEQA
broke a bit awkwardly, tracked the pace three wide and stayed on to hold the show. LEA RO stalked the winner two wide, bid nearing the lane but was
one-paced through the stretch. STAR SWEPT went evenly while racing two wide. CODRINGTON failed to menace while racing three wide. NANTUCKET
RED hit the starting gate, trailed inside while rank through the initial three furlongs, angled widest early on the backstretch, continued four wide around the
far turn and never threatened. UNA LUNA raced well back two wide, swung out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. REAGAN'S ROSE saved ground
tracking the winner and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
WILLY BOI prompted the leading duelers three wide, bid for the lead at the quarter pole, dueled outside of REAL TALK through upper stretch as that foe
dug in, but drew clear from that foe approaching the sixteenth pole. REAL TALK dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, dug in as his outermost foe
made a menacing bid at the quarter pole, battled through upper stretch, but was headed passing the furlong marker, then got bested approaching the final
sixteenth. FAMOUS GENT broke a step slowly, saved ground far off of the pace, rallied to claim show in upper stretch, then chased the leaders home while
holding his position. BEASTER chased along the inside while a path off of the rail around the turn, but failed to produce a bid. GATSBY dueled for the lead
two wide and between horses, but weakened passing the quarter pole. ONEMORETIMEAROUND was a bit crowded between horses at the start, lied at the
rear of the field two wide, took the turn in the three path before swinging five wide turning for home, but failed to mount a rally. PALADIO tracked from
midpack in the four path around the turn, but weakened in upper stretch.

MAVERICK settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch and rallied between rivals to gain the show. FULLY LOADED saved
ground in midpack, angled three wide in upper stretch, rallied through the lane but was outkicked. TIGER BLOOD was bumped at the start, raced off the
pace three wide, swung widest turning for home, rallied down the center of the course but was outkicked for the minor awards. QUARKY prompted the pace
two wide, could not keep pace with DARE DAY in upper stretch, was starting to gain in midstretch, checked near the eighth pole and was not encouraged
further. DUGOUT lost action while in tight at the rail midway down the backstretch, dropped back inside, tipped out nearing the lane and never threatened.
RUNNING FOR RIZ was bumped between foes at the start, chased the pace three wide, was pushed out turning for home and dropped back under mild
urging. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE BEFORE ALLOWING THE ORIGINAL ORDER

Footnotes
PEARLESCENT lied off of the pace in the two path, gained down the backstretch to be in range of the leaders a half mile from home, stalked the leading trio
around the far turn before shifting five wide passing the three sixteenths grounds, then rallied to produce a bid passing the furlong marker, and drew clear in
the late stages. UPTOWN QUEEN broke outwards and hindered a rival at the start, lied far off of the pace two wide, trailed in the far turn before gaining
three wide around that bend, swung seven wide turning for home, and rallied willingly outside of foes through the lane. ALLURING RUMBA saved ground
from midpack, squeezed through a narrow seem two wide and between horses in upper stretch to bid for the lead at the furlong marker, but was outfinished
by outer foes. MIRANDA SOFIA tracked from midpack in the three to four path, gained mildly while getting floated six wide turning for home, then leveled off
through the lane. WINNIPEG WONDER stalked two wide, vied around the far turn before coming into the lane between horses, forged a narrow advantage
in upper stretch, but drifted out passing the furlong pole, bumped MATCHA, and yielded thereafter. MATCHA stalked three wide, bid for the lead passing the
quarter pole, came into the lane between horses as outer rivals ranged up alongside, but was bumped by an inner foe passing the furlong grounds, and
weakened. ROSEY'S INVASION was bothered by an inner foe at the start, lied well off of the pace in the four path around the first turn, then two wide
around the far turn, and chased the leaders home from between horses through the lane before finding traffic in the late stages. SIGNING BONUS saved
ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. OUR WEST INDY rushed into the first turn to clear the field with six furlongs to run, set the pace around the far
turn before meeting a pair of bids at the quarter pole, and stopped thereafter.
