AUSTRALASIA stalked the pace from the three path then responded when asked on the turn and drew off while driving. INAWIC was allowed to settle from
the inside then dueled for a half and was clearly second best. TECATE TIME dropped back early on the inside and made an outside rally to be up for the
show. STREAMER was unhurried early from the two path and failed to menace. NON BINDING pressed the pace from the four path and tired. TAYLOR
AVENUE set the early pace from the two path then gave way and was eased to the wire.

ISOLATION raced in the middle of the pack from the inside then circled the field on the turn and drew clear under steady urging. FASTHAPPY was allowed
to settle in the four path then made an outside rally on the turn to be up for the place. ALHAMBRA PALACE was unhurried early on the inside then steadily
advanced from the three path came again late in the stretch to hold the show. TRACK SMART pressed the pace from the inside made a mild bid in the
stretch and was out finished late. MAGGIE'S RETURN stalked the pace from the two path then led briefly at the half and faded. MIDNIGHT TRIP failed to
menace. HONG KONG STRONG stalked the pace from the two path and gave way. SWEET PINOT was squeezed at the break and allowed to settle but
was not a factor. BUILDING HOME broke to the outside at the break then was rushed to contention and gave way at the half to be eased to the wire.

Footnotes
WHY GOD pinched back at the start then allowed to settle in the three path rallied on the outside and was up in final strides. KRAFTY BOY raced in the
middle of the pack from the two path made a bid in the turn and just missed. ALWAYS A CATCH stalked the pace from the inside and made a bid in the
stretch and had his best strides late. MISTAKE PRESENT pressed the pace from the three path then dueled from the inside on the final turn and faded late.
ZING ZANG was rank early then allowed to settle in the three path and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. APPLEWOOD dropped back and was not a factor.
DOUBLE COOL raced in the middle of the pack and failed to menace. APALACHEE BAY was away alertly then dueled from the two path was in tight final
turn and gave way. WHEN I DO set the pace early and was through after a half.
