Footnotes
AMITY ISLAND shook off light contact with the second place finisher in the shadow of the starting gate, chased the pace alternating between path two and
the inside route, was along the latter cutting the corner into the stretch with good momentum, took charge in short order, then kicked well clear, best
described as being ridden out. ROSEY'S PEACH assumed a prominent position after coming in slightly and brushing with the eventual winner, vied for
command spaced at quite a distance from off the rail, went about the task from the three path on the turn, felt the presence of the top one as three-quarters
was being completed, slithered into the two path in response to AMITY ISLAND's impending challenge, failed to intimidate the nemesis, haplessly watched
that foe draw off after taking over, barely saved the place. MARIA'S GIFT along the outside, sparred for command to the right of ROSEY'S PEACH,
undergoing the task from path four on the turn, came under a drive as three-quarters was being rattled off, commenced the stretch drive a bit nearer to the
rail, inched up to the runner up, fell short of snagging away second. THEATRICAL DANCER saved ground for nearly six furlongs, angled four wide into
upper stretch, had no offering. BELLAMY'SPARTYGIRL placed along the inside route, failed to respond appreciably though asked during the run around the
bend, stepped into the lane and backed away. EMPLOYEES ONLY three wide onto the turn, got sent out one path wider exiting the bend, gave way.
QUASHANA parked out four to five wide on the turn, was never in it.

Footnotes
OH MY PAPA bumped at the start by MACHO JACK who broke outwards, came under coaxing to establish the front and showed the way in hand three then
two wide, came under pressure through the turn and was placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide for home, edged clear under a drive
and held well to the finish. DR. DEVERA'S WAY coaxed from the gate, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the
turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors by a head. BEACH FRONT got tipped
out shortly after the start to be seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, went five wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths,
cornered six wide at the head of the stretch and offered up a mild kick. QUEEN'S MASON hustled from the gate, prompted the leader three to four paths off
the inside coming out slightly to near the nine-sixteenths which in turn persuaded VENTUS to do the same forcing jostling between foes at that station, went
three wide through the turn increasing the pressure on the leader placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun four wide into upper stretch, got shaken
off straightened away and weakened in the late stages. JUSTICE OF WAR coaxed from the gate, raced five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch,
had VENTUS come out slightly and was bumped and jostled between that rival and DR. DEVERA'S WAY at the nine-sixteenths, got taken hold of and lost
about two lengths to ground, chased three to four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered five to six wide for home and made
no headway. MACHO JACK broke out at the start bumping OH MY PAPA, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, swung three to four
wide for home and tired. VENTUS hustled from the gate, chased four then five wide down the backstretch when forced to tip out slightly by QUEEN'S
MASON and in doing so bumped with JUTSICE OF WAR jostling with that rival for the five path before forcing that foe to take hold against pressure outside
from DR. DEVERA'S WAY, went three wide through the turn, continued three to four wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
HALO CITY sat reserved undergoing a three to two wide journey until the end of the second bend, came under stronger handling after three-quarters had
been completed, was hard ridden angling towards path five for entrance into the stretch, clawed his way towards the ones to catch, continue to whittle away
at the deficit, striking the front end a short distance from the finish line to prove best. MANDATORY chased the pace from the two path, between opponents
for a good portion of the opening half, got roused for the drive home, was one of three contending for the top on near even terms with each other by the
beginning of the final furlong, proved to be a stubborn one to end only to see HALO CITY get there. AJHAR was in hand prompting the pace, going about
the task two to three wide, was more the latter turning into the stretch, found himself between rivals fighting for command at the eighth pole, ventured
onward with willingness, only to ultimately have to settle for the show award. JOHNNYPUMP strung out three wide on both turns, commenced the stretch
one path farther off the rail, stayed on to secure the final significant slice of the purse. AUNT KAT away alertly, grabbed a narrow advantage, showed the
way subtly shifting between the inside route and path two, being more the latter on the backstretch, came under a ride spinning into the lane, gave it to
heavy pressure during the run through the furlong grounds, steadily weakened. BOURBON RISING faltered after undergoing a ground-saving journey.
TRUE PALACE taken hold after bobbling at the start, was three wide swinging onto the backstretch, departed it from path two, went much wider into the
stretch, drifted out while going down the lane on empty.

MICROSCOPE hustled from the gate, established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand from the two path through the opening bend
before taking to the three path down the backstretch under the watchful eye of TOO EARLY latched on to the outside, had that rival up the ante into the far
turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, drew off under a drive holding well to the wire kept to task. COLD

honors clear of the rest. ADVANCED STRATEGY coaxed from the gate, raced three wide through the first turn, chased five paths off the inside down the
backstretch and through the far turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went five to six wide at the head of the stretch, kept on to just best a rival for the
show honors. TOO EARLY hustled from the gate, raced three wide through the first turn forwardly placed, attended the leader from the outside five then four

Footnotes
SHE'S A BLACK BELT away without apparent mishap, slid into the pocket coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, kept pace with the front runners
during the run around the bend, got cued up tipping into the two path approaching the head of the stretch, became engaged with the second place finisher
soon afterwards, fought fiercely down the lane eye to eye with the nemesis, gamely prevailed. PRINCESS COREY sparred for the top from path two, got
roused venturing slightly wider into the stretch, forged to a slim advantage during the ensuing furlong, but with the winner looming boldly to the inside, was
inched inward for a better view of SHE'S A BLACK BELT, vied with vigour the remainder of the trip to the wire, wound up the one denied. MISS MI MI
pursued the pace from the two path, came under a drive springing from the five-sixteenths pole, angled four wide into the stretch, finished well enough to be
along for the show. CITY TEMPER established the top shortly after the field had been sent on its way, cut over to the inside, showed the way, tailed by
PRINCESS COREY from the outside, was put to the test by the top twosome turning into the stretch, got switched over to stronger handling in the vicinity of
the three-sixteenths marker, yielded, battled onward for another furlong before weakening. SIRENIC took up the chase three wide on the turn, got sent out
into the five path in upper stretch, lacked the necessary response. MAMA KIN at or near the two path in pursuit of the pace, was already being called upon
for more by the five-sixteenths pole, got steered to the outside going into the stretch, wandered out six wide making no headway. ANCIENT BROWN rode
the rail, was sighted under a hand ride on the bend, stepped into the stretch and faltered. ADHWAA two wide onto the turn, angled four wide leaving it,
launched no bids.

Footnotes
JERRY THE NIPPER attained a forward position after brushing with another at the start, disputed the pace three wide, moved when ready as three-quarters
was being reached, taking over while yet on hold, began to drift out when called upon for more in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, went about a
straighter course for the final sixteenth and held sway. OPT quickly spotted along the rail, rode it for six furlongs, got angled four wide for the drive home,
had to settle for second after being staved off. TWISTED TOM tracked the pace from just off the rail, got steered outward for the stretch run, was eventually
in path seven rallying for third. FREAKY STYLEY chased the pace from near the inside, tipped onto the two path stepping onto the top of the lane, backed
away. SIX PERCENT brushed from both sides in the shadow of the starting gate, travelled four to five wide on the turn, got sent out into path six once in the
stretch, made no headway. BOURBON BAY chased the pace two to three wide, shifted out into path five for the drive, gave way. PATEGORY ONE argued
for control towards path two until the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, tired. CONTROL GROUP off the along the outside, was in path four coming onto
and coming off of the turn, folded. SEVEN LILIES chased the pace from path five after brushing with SIX PERCENT right after the start, steadily retreated
during the run around the bend, came into the lane and retreated even more. VELOCE three wide early, was only a brief factor.

Footnotes
MRS. ORB seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, went six wide through the turn, swung seven wide into upper stretch, rallied to take narrow
command a furlong out, knocked heads with the runner up to the sixteenth marker before gamely inching away to the finish to prevail. SHARP STARR
coaxed from the gate, prompted the leader from the outside six then five paths off the rail, swung six wide into upper stretch, took command at the
three-sixteenths narrowly, dug in between foes and was headed a furlong out, dueled to the sixteenth pole, then fought on to the finish while being shaken
off in the late stages, clear of the rest for the place honors. ESPRESSO SHOT five then four wide in pursuit, tucked briefly three wide at the five-sixteenths
before angling out four wide into upper stretch bidding for the front, got bumped straightened away as PRAIRIE FIRE came in slightly, then weakened in the
late stages. PRAIRIE FIRE coaxed from the start, showed the way lightly coaxed along five then four paths off the rail, came under pressure nearing the
quarter pole, swung five wide at that station into upper stretch, came in slightly straightened for home bumping with ESPRESSO SHOT, yielded the front
with three-sixteenths to go and weakened.

Footnotes
INVESTMENT GRADE established the top after being put to an abbreviated hand ride, got tucked into the two path prior to leaving the backstretch, showed
the way, feeling some pressure from AVID SUCINORI from the outside and with the runner up drafting a short distance behind, got cued up heading for the
top of the lane, saw CAPTIVATING CARA closing in menacingly in the last eighth, dug in with good determination to prevail. CAPTIVATING CARA
abandoned the inside route for path two approaching the half mile pole, was well held following the winner's cover from the top of the bend until its end,
tipped to the outside for the drive, settled in path three and was called upon for more in the vicinity of three-sixteenths pole, began to chip away at the deficit
soon afterwards, battled on to the wire, but came up short. STELLA MARS eyed the winner from just off the rail for nearly a half, was gradually worked into
path five from upper to midstretch, went on to best AVID SUCINORI for third. AVID SUCINORI lightly bumped at the start, pressed the issue from path
three, failed to claim the top, remained a prominent factor before weakening late. VIVE LA LIBERTY gunned from the gate, tracked the winner loosely
pocketed, stepped into the lane, made no late headway. WILLOW GROVE pinched at the start, departed the backstretch from the three path, wandered
outward down the stretch until approximately seven wide, made no impact. WISH FOR MAGIC at a considerable distance from off the rail, raced five wide
on the turn, was moved out wider and wider until in the neighborhood of path eight by the sixteenth pole, had no punch. THE GREAT POOHDINI guided
over to the rail at the half mile pole, got steered into path two at the top of the lane, never got involved. FLIRTACIOUS KISS within striking distance four
wide for the opening half, gave way. BLESSED MOTHERMARY strung out five wide at the top of the turn, was in path six exiting it, failed to contend. RED
PRIESTESS brushed at the start, raced two wide on the turn, never reached a contending position.
