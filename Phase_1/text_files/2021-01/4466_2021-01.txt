KIST pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, made the lead three wide and held on by the narrowest of margins under strong handling. GERTIE CAT
never far back, late rally, rallied determinedly four wide through the stretch and just missed. HIGH CUPPER never far back, loomed boldly along the inside
into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. MY PINK BABY BIRD settled in a stalking position and failed to respond. WILD COWGIRL made the lead
soon after the start, set the pace into the stretch and weakened late. DANCING GRACE close up inside, faded in the lane.

LUCKY TO HAVE ME prompted the pace from the inside into the turn, made the lead nearing the quarter pole, set the balance of the pace and widened
through the stretch under strong handling to win as much the best. LA MUNECA broke in front, set the pace for nearly a half then was no match for the
winner. ENCHANTED NILE moved up along the inside into the stretch then leveled off. MUNNINGS SOUL was bumped at the start then lacked the needed
response. TIZ ABBY failed to menace. SEEKING VIOLET bore out at the start bumping rivals, avoided a rival in distress before a quarter by altering course
sharply to that one's outside, was in tight entering the turn then failed to reach contention. KENTUCKY HOME had brief speed. BEAUTIFULSTREETCAT
was bumped at the start, suffered a catastrophic injury at the nine sixteenths pole, was pulled up then euthanized.

OUR TIME unhurried early, swung wide, closed fast five wide through the final furlong and was along in time. GRANDGRAN stalked the early pace, dug in
three wide through the stretch and finished second best in a game effort. CHARCOAL never far back, finished with good courage four wide. DEO VOLENTE
stalked the early pace, slipped through along the inside to make the lead nearing the quarter pole, battled until deep stretch then was outfinished. ROMPED
pressed the early pace two wide, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole, matched strides the balance of the trip and was also outfinished despite
a determined effort. SLATE was outrun. FAHRENHEIT had brief speed. FIRST VICTORY set the early pace, had speed into the stretch, stopped abruptly,
stumbled inside the furlong marker and unseated his rider. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

altered course to the inside and finished with good courage. CLOSE THE CASE pressed the pace three wide, made the lead entering the turn, set the pace
until deep stretch then came up empty. NANO close up from the start, loomed boldly four wide on the turn then weakened. EMPIREMEISTER stalked the
pace into the turn, bid three wide then faltered. RY'S REVENGE was no threat. STORM PEAK dueled for the lead two wide and was through after a half.
BEYOND GONE battled for the early lead along the inside then was used up.

DEER CREEK ROAD trailed into the stretch, swung wide, circled his field with a burst of speed to make the lead past the sixteenth marker and drew clear.
IT'S YOUR CALL allowed to settle, surged two wide to make the lead in deep stretch then couldn't handle the late charger of the winner. BEARPATH dueled
for the lead along the inside for a half, shook clear, drifted out in mid stretch and weakened. JUDGE HEAD stalked the pace from the inside and went
evenly. OHIO MUNNY was no threat. SKYTOWN CAT was no factor. RIDGE WEST failed to menace. DENNY M battled for the lead two wide for a half
then stopped.

Footnotes
MACHA'S REWARD unhurried early, circled his field around the far turn, made the lead three wide and finished full of run to win as much the best. CAPE
MARCO DRIVE never far back, rallied late four wide and finished second best. KINGS HIGHWAY allowed to settle, advanced steadily along the rail,
checked hard at the three eighths pole, came on again through upper stretch, lacked racing room in mid stretch and finished with good courage. GIO
SAMMY pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, made the lead then came up empty in deep stretch. TRUENO failed to menace. WEBER with the
second flight two wide, was in tight at the three furlong marker then faded. BUMPA stalked the pace into the stretch then failed to respond. WATCH YOUR
STEP broke sharply, set the pace for six furlongs then tired. REDMARK was outrun. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO
ACTION.
