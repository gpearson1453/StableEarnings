Footnotes
GOLD SHARK stalked inside angling out into the turn, hooked foe in upper stretch taking over late clearing in the three path. DREAM SATURDAY laid close
up going in close quarters near the half mile pole, pressured on the turn dueling into upper stretch proving no match for the winner. WINK AND A NOD was
in tight running up heels bobbling and checking nearing the half mile pole, regrouped somewhat to upper stretch finishing evenly to best the others.
KENTUCKY KITTEN away alertly set the pace coming under pressure on the turn, digging in near the rail in upper stretch would eventually wear down. IT'S
THE JOURNEY played no factor. SUPER BEAU struggled throughout. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION DREAM SATURDAY WAS DISQUALIFIED AND
PLACED THIRD FOR INTERFERENCE WITH WINK AND A NOD NEARING THE HALF MILE POLE.
