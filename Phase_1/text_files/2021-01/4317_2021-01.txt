Footnotes
ACCESSIBLE rated off of the pace along the inside of foes while in about the two path, remained under patient handling around the far turn before smoothly
tipping four wide turning for home to commence a rally, ranged up to the leaders inside the furlong marker, and drove clear through the final sixteenth. BIG
PERM saved ground from midpack, smoothly tipped three wide approaching the lane to bid for the lead in upper stretch, forged an advantage approaching
the furlong pole, but was outkicked by an outer rallying rival approaching the sixteenth pole. JEALOUS EYES pulled keenly and required hard restraint while
off of the pace in the three path around the first turn, gained mildly while getting floated to the four to five path turning for home, then stayed on through the
lane to just claim show. CUY stalked the loose leader two wide, bid for the lead turning for home, but was outkicked in upper stretch, kept on, but was nailed
on the wire for show. TREASURE RUN stalked along the inside, but was outmoved by BIG PERM to his outside turning for home, shifted off of the rail in
upper stretch, and chased the leaders home without producing a bid. PRINCE VALESKI hesitated at the start, lied at the rear of the field tow wide, and
improved in the lane. SPIRITUAL KING established a loose lead around the first turn, showed the way around the far turn, but was headed passing the
three sixteenths grounds, and weakened in upper stretch. ELBRUS hopped and bumped the gate at the start causing him to be off poorly, then saved
ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. HOOYAH tracked from midpack in the four to three path around the turns, but faded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
NOBLE EMPIRE stalked the clear leader three wide early on, gradually gained on that rival while in the three path around the turn, assumed command
approaching the quarter pole, was driven to extend his advantage from the three sixteenths pole to the furlong marker, did so readily while shifting ground
outwards, then was geared down through the late stages. MAGICAL CAUSE lied forwardly placed four wide, stayed in the four path around the turn while
not able to match strides with NOBLE EMPIRE, then stayed on through the lane to bid for place passing the furlong pole, and prevailed for that position in
the late stages. CALABASH broke outwardly and brushed an outer foe at the start, tracked from midpack along the inside, but came under a drive passing
the half mile pole, failed to respond to that urging and lost ground into the turn, but saved ground around the bend before leaving the rail passing the three
sixteenths pole, then came again outside of foes in the final furlong, but missed achieving place. JUST LIKE MIKE cleared early on, held that clear
advantage into the turn, but offered little resistance to NOBLE EMPIRE's bid approaching the quarter pole, dug in for place passing the furlong grounds, but
was outfinished by multiple foes late. SKYLINE VIEW bumped an inner foe at the start, tracked from midpack two wide and between horses early on, but
failed to keep pace with those rivals into the turn, shifted out and took then bend in the five path, then failed to factor. BELLAMY'S TREASURE was bumped
between horses at the start, trailed down the backstretch, took the turn three wide, and failed to menace. LIQUID LOUIE never got involved. TONE FEELIN
was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
DIAMONDS ENJOY set the pace along the rail, was headed turning for home, fought on inside, regained command nearing the sixteenth pole and edged
ahead under left-handed urging. MISTER KELLY stalked the pace three wide, angled into the two path nearing the quarter pole, took the lead outside of the
winner turning for home, led past the eighth pole, dueled to deep stretch but was outgamed. I KICKN stalked the pace two wide between the top two
finishers, angled three wide when those foes edged away nearing the lane, could not keep pace with them but stayed on well enough to hold the show.
ROAD TO PEACE was bumped at the start, trailed inside to upper stretch, tipped out and improved position. ALL INCLUSIVE was bumped at the start,
raced three wide and never threatened. CAPITAN FOFO had brief speed two wide. TOOK A CAB chased the pace four wide, angled in near the quarter
pole and came up empty.

Footnotes
MILLEAN stalked three wide, vied two wide into the turn, led between horses passing the quarter pole, dug in gamely inside of a pair of foes in upper
stretch, and prevailed in the duel passing the sixteenth pole. HOUDINI'S AWESOME tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, shifted from the
three to four path at the five sixteenths pole to bid for the lead outside of foes turning for home, chased the dueling leaders from right off of their flanks
through the lane, but did not have enough to reach the winner while achieving place. SPHEROID tracked from midpack three wide while in the four path,
shifted down to the three path while stalking the leading pair into the turn, bid for the lead three wide at the quarter pole, dueled between rivals through the
lane as MILLEAN dug in to his inside and HOUDINI'S AWESOME ranged up alongside, but was repelled by the prior passing the sixteenth marker, and got
nailed by the latter for place on the wire. FLAMINGO HAWK broke outwardly and hindered multiple foes at the start, tracked from midpack along the inside,
inched closer and loomed behind the leaders at the five sixteenths pole, shifted two wide turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the leading trio in
upper stretch and came up empty. WILL TAKE CONTROL set the pace along the inside, was headed by a pair of foes at the quarter pole, and weakened
passing the three sixteenths marker. PASSWORD PROTECTED was forced out at the start by an inner rival, bothered an outer rival in the process, trailed
the field early on, gained ground mildly in the four to five path around the turn, but failed to menace. UNION GAP was wiped out at the start by an inner foe,
lied off of the pace in the three path around the turn, and failed to factor. NOW A JAGUAR was outrun along the inside. PACIFIC LEGEND stalked two wide
and between horses early on, but weakened approaching the three furlong pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
MIA MARTINA settled well back while saving ground, advanced three wide around the far turn, came five wide into the lane, closed strongly while getting in
a bit under left-handed urging and was up and clear late. DIRECTOR'S CUT tracked the pace four wide while a bit keen under firm rating, continued in the
four path rounding the far turn, was bumped in upper stretch, took the lead nearing the eighth pole, edged ahead of the pacesetter but had no resistance to
the winner late. PHANTOM VISION stumbled with alacrity at the start, sped to the front, set the pace in the two path, came out a bit and bumped
DIRECTOR'S CUT in upper stretch, was collared near the eighth pole and held well enough to persevere the show. YAFA saved ground in range, made
progress in upper stretch but flattened out late. MISS ADELINE was in range two wide and lacked a rally. RUNAWAY ROCKETTE pressed the pace three
wide and came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
SPEEDING dueled for the lead two wide and between horses early on, then just inside of SIMPLY THE BEST around the turn while staying in the two path,
inched away from that foe in upper stretch, then gamely held that foe's rebid and an inner bidding rival at bay in the late stages. MADEMOISELLE NOVA
vied along the inside, took back to stalk into the turn, then produced a rail bid through the lane, but just missed. SIMPLY THE BEST dueled for the lead
three wide, then just outside of the eventual winner while staying in the three path around the turn, came into the lane between horses, but failed to keep
pace with her inner counterpart in upper stretch, chased that foe through the lane and stayed on to rebid in the late stages, but did not have enough to catch
her. MADEIRA WINE broke inwards and bumped a rival at the start, tracked from midpack two wide, then stayed on while drifting out in the final furlong.
BREEHAZEL hopped outwards and soundly bumped with ZAFFING at the start, recovered to stalk the leading trio four wide, produced a bid for the lead
while in the four path turning for home, but flattened out in midstretch. FIRST HOUR broke inwards and was off poorly, lied far off of the pace two wide and
between horses, swung five wide in upper stretch, and rallied outside of rivals. ZAFFING hopped inwards and soundly bumped with BREEHAZEL at the
start, tracked from midpack along the inside before swinging four wide in upper stretch, but failed to threaten. ESTELLINA got loose twice behind the gate,
then was bumped by an outer foe at the start, lied far off of the pace three wide, and improved without threatening. CARIBE BEAN MOKA stalked along the
inside, but weakened into the turn, and was done early. STRONG MOMENT bumped the gate at the start, then outrun along the inside. THAROS hesitated
at the start, lied off of the pace three wide, got floated six wide turning for home, and weakened. CATIRUSIA dwelt at the start and was off many lengths
behind the field, then was outrun throughout.

Footnotes
WEISSER pressed the pace three wide, took a short lead near the seven-sixteenths marker, set the pace outside of TAKE CHARGE DUDE from there,
kicked clear leaving the eighth pole and held clear under a drive. NORTHERN stalked a three-ply duel in the clear inside early, angled three wide midway
around the turn and stayed on to gain the place. KAREN'S COVE raced off the pace two wide for a half and rallied for the show. DR HARLAN saved ground
off the pace, tipped out nearing the lane and had a mild rally between foes. AEQUOR lacked early speed, raced three wide around the turn, fanned widest in
upper stretch and rallied belatedly down the center of the track. YOUNG RAYMOND was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two wide, continued on the
left lead in the lane and improved position. BLACK PEPPER broke awkwardly, trailed inside for a half and finished with some interest inside. TAKE
CHARGE DUDE was bumped at the start, set the pace along the rail, vied inside of the winner from the seven-sixteenths to the three-sixteenths and tired.
MARCELINO failed to menace while racing five wide. VINCENT WILLIAM vied two wide between foes and retreated nearing the lane. LONDON
WEREWOLF chased the pace four wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF SHADES cleared early on, held a loose lead around the turn, widened her advantage in upper stretch, but tired late as CHOOSE JOY surged,
and just lasted. CHOOSE JOY stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leader turning for home, rallied with a late surge approaching the wire, but
missed. ROMAN D'ORO saved ground off of the pace, cut the corner and attempted a rail bid through the lane, but did not have enough to threaten the top

Footnotes
MISCHEVIOUS ALEX saved ground in range early, was boxed in two wide throughout the far turn, angled four wide near the quarter pole, responded
immediately, seized command nearing the eighth pole and quickly drew off under a drive. YODEL E. A. WHO set a pressured pace in the two path, led to
the eighth pole, was no match for the winner but held well for the place. ADMIRAL LYNCH made a four wide move around the turn, could not keep pace
with the winner in upper stretch but churned on to gain the show. OURNATIONONPARADE pressed the pace three wide and weakened in the drive.
SHIRL'S SPEIGHT saved ground to no avail. EPIC DREAMER chased the pace three wide and faded in the lane. FORTUNE'S FOOL played no factor
while racing two wide. RUNFORTHEMUNNINGS broke several lengths behind the field, circled five wide around the turn to reach contention then tired
through the stretch. SHOT TANKER (CHI) had brief speed inside.

Footnotes
JOUSTER set the pace with a loose lead while having her ears pricked, readily responded when let out a notch turning for home, impressively widened her
advantage under hand urging through upper stretch, and was geared down in the late stages. CHAMPAGNE IVY stalked along the inside, shifted outside of
the loose leader while under pressure with five sixteenths to run, but quickly proved no match for that foe turning for home, lost placed to an inner foe in
upper stretch, but came again in the late stages to reclaim that position. POINT WILD saved ground while forwardly placed, advanced inside of
CHAMPAGNE IVY to claim place in upper stretch while in a different zip code from the leader, but tired late and was outfinished by her outer counterpart.
NEVER CONTENT (IRE) tracked from midpack two wide, tipped in around the far turn after her inner rival moved forward, swung three wide in upper
stretch, but only managed a chasing rally. WOW saved ground off of the pace, swung four wide turning for home, and stayed on for a minor share. ITALIAN
TWIN stalked two wide, but yielded passing the five sixteenths grounds. MISS EMPIREMENT saved ground far off of the pace, and improved through the
lane. FAMILY TIME lied forwardly placed four to three wide around the first turn, but faded around the far turn. TIZ AMERICAN was last away, saved ground
while trailing the field around both turns, but to no avail. DEEP WATER CAY got caught three wide around both turns while far off of the pace, and failed to
get involved. GOLDIE'S DELIGHT lied off of the pace two wide and between horses around the far turn, but weakened.
