PIMM AND PROPER settled close off the rail, rallied to the lead three wide approaching the quarter pole, drew clear midway on the far turn and was
steadily encouraged to edge away from UPSY DAISY DO, who took prompt control of the early pace, was met by Jet Settin lady leaving the half mile pole
and dueled clear of that one on the far turn, but was caught at the same time by the winner and settled for second best. IMAGOODCHATTERBUG saved
ground off the pace then eased out to give chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths and was along for third
mid-stretch. JET SETTIN LADY stalked the pace two deep and challenged the runner-up leaving the half mile pole, dueled at even terms from that point but
dropped back into the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
SWING YOUR SWORD rated the early pace inside then came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn at the rail and dug in under
steady stretch encouragement to hold on well. MOSS BOSS steadied off the heels of Swing Your Sword and angled to the two path approaching the three
eighths pole, gave chase from that point and raced off the rail on the turn, then dueled through the stretch for second, while unable to gain significantly on
the winner. GOLDEN ANSWER chased from the four path and raced close three wide on the turn, dug in from the head of the lane but relented in the duel
for second. JESS'S RESERVE chased the pace about the three path down the backstretch and was shuffled back in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole,
continued the drive past the quarter pole and raced evenly down the lane. REDS IMAGE broke awkwardly and steadied leaving the gate, picked up the
chase outside, raced in the five path of the turn and finished evenly. FROSTED WHITE FACE gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and showed little
more. JIMMYTHEPACO gave chase then saved ground on the turn. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Golden Answer, lodged by
the rider of Jess's Reserve, though, found insufficient cause for change.
