Footnotes
SARJENALLI broke slowly, then was held up avoiding tight quarters at the start, continued under firm restraint dropping out last in the opening quarter,
saved ground through the turn, steadily advanced to contention inside foes leaving the quarter mile marker and went clear late under some left handed
pressure. CECI'SAPRILHOTTIE settled outside foes in the opening stages, steadily gained momentum shifting out four wide nearing upper stretch and
continued with a steady bid while just outkicked by the winner. DUDES LAWYER ducked inwards at the start crossing over the path of the eventual winner,
was righted, then urged inside a rival prompting the pace through the backstretch into the turn, shifted off the rail racing into upper stretch and weakened
late. MCALLENS MUSIC tracked off the first flight under light rating in the opening quarter, shifted three wide on the turn while being urged to challenge for
command nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. CHILLS AND FEVER settled into stride off the inside racing through the backstretch and
failed to mount a serious challenge. CODE METTLE, urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch into the turn, gave way entering
the lane.

TEA PARTY broke readily to gain the advantage while shifting off the inside in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a narrow margin between foes
racing into the turn, then edged clear through the stretch under firm right handed pressure. MOON EYES tracked just off the first flight between foes racing
to the turn, split rivals just off the inside entering upper stretch to challenge outside the winner but proved no match while best of the others. DANGEROUS
CURVES tracked off the first flight racing four wide through the backstretch into the turn, steadily gained position nearing upper stretch but lacked the
needed late kick. DIVA DANA, forwardly placed three wide prompting a rival's pace racing to the turn, faded into upper stretch. MADAME ROUGE angled to
the inside in the opening stages while being prompted in pursuit of the pacesetter to upper stretch but came up empty leaving the furlong marker. CAJUN
DELIGHT dwelt at the start losing contact with the field and trailed throughout. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
OSPREY stalked just off the first flight along the inside under rating racing to the far turn, shifted out three wide in upper stretch to challenge for command,
wrested the advantage in late stages and held JEHA to the end under firm handling. The latter was restless in the gate, then off a step slowly, settled along
the inside to the backstretch, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady late bid while being just outkicked. HIGHLY NOTED
sped to the lead while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the far turn, was roused clear into the lane but yielded to
the top pair late. KICK IT CHARLIE, forwardly placed attending a rival's pace, moved to press the issue on the far turn but came up empty in late stages.
TICKET TO ALASKA tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the far turn but offered no rally. HANDSOME EFFORT tracked off the first flight
between foes racing to the far turn and faded into upper stretch. JUST NOD AND SMILE tracked off the first flight outside foes, made brief progress three
wide to gain some position after a half but faded early.

Footnotes
SECRET LIFE STYLE broke sharply, was urged to prompt the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch, went clear into the turn and held sway on
a comfortable advantage through the stretch while being kept to some right handed pressure. OX TROT tracked off the first flight near the inside in the
opening quarter, split foes on the turn advancing on the leader in tandem with a rival, shifted out to the three path entering the lane but couldn't gain terms
with the winner while proving best of the others. GOLD WING, held up in close quarters at the start, was righted to track off the second flight racing to the
turn and continued with interest to improve position between rivals to late stages. MALIO'S broke inwards bumping ROLLER, was righted to gain a position
tracking just off the leaders outside a rival on the backstretch, was prompted to lodge a brief bid just outside the pacesetter entering the turn but came up
empty racing into upper stretch. DAHOG proved no factor. KELA BREW was urged inside the eventual winner disputing the pace from the outset into the
turn but gave way after a half. ROLLER, bumped by MALIO'S at the start, exchanged some contact with GOLD WING, was righted to track off the second
flight while shifting out four wide racing to the turn but soon emptied out. CHISELED trailed throughout.

Footnotes
FEISTY KITTEN, reserved between foes tracking behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, made steady progress gain position between foes
racing through the far turn, split foes just off the inside to challenge for command entering upper stretch and was roused clear. O'HAIRE, in touch with a rival
attending the pace under light rating racing to the backstretch, shifted out three deep after a half, pressed the issue in that path entering the far turn,
continued outside a rival to upper stretch but proved no match for the winner in the closing stages while prevailing for the place honors. ANGEL'S ENTRY
tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, continued widest after a half, shifted inwards conceding some position racing into the far
turn, angled five wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to edge a rival for a share. MONETIZED tracked just off the
leaders inside foes racing to the backstretch, continued under firm reserve dropping out last racing into the far turn, swung out six wide nearing upper
stretch and continued with a steady effort while just outkicked for a share. SMOKEY SONG tracked off the first flight between foes under light rating to the
backstretch, split foes foes after a half to press the pace into the far turn, shifted to the inside nearing upper stretch but faded leaving the furlong marker.
LORD BYRON tracked off the first flight three wide in the opening half, was prompted to lodge a brief bid in that path racing through the far turn but flattened
out in upper stretch. DRILL BIT, off slowly, was settled along the inside to the backstretch and failed to gain striking distance. RECLINER, urged to dictate
the pace while angling to the inside leaving the chute, gave way after a half. ALPERES settled inside foes racing to the backstretch, shifted off the inside
and steadily faded after a half.

Footnotes
SECRET MAGICIAN worked his way to the inside racing past the chute to take a position behind the second flight, steadily advanced to contention saving
ground to upper stretch, bid for command nearest the rail when presented an opening approaching midstretch, then edged forward and held FRENCH KISS
ME to the end under firm handling. The latter angled to the rail in early stages tracking the leaders inside foes in second flight, steadily drew into contention
racing into the turn, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch advancing to challenge and continued willingly to the end while being just outkicked.
ROARING RIVER came under some prompting to gain a contending position in the opening stages, shifted inwards to track off the second flight racing to
the turn, steadily gained position between foes racing into upper stretch, altered course when racing in close quarters while lacking a path midstretch, then
shifted to the inside late while prevailing for a share. HIMELSTEIN, urged inside rivals prompting the pace through the backstretch into the turn, edged
forward between calls entering the lane but yielded once headed by the winner. ON DUTY, prominent between foes from the outset, dictated the pace on a
narrow margin between foes racing into the turn and weakened leaving midstretch. SOLE SEEKER, urged to terms with the first flight three wide prompting
the pace, gave way into upper stretch. SIERRA CAT tracked the leaders four wide between foes racing to the turn but lacked a closing response. ODESSA
GOLD settled last early and failed to menace thereafter. IMPERIAL PALACE, unhurried five wide between foes racing to the turn, soon dropped out. KING
ANDRES tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn and gave way after a half. BIBLICAL QUOTES made brief pursuit of the leaders six wide
on the backstretch and gave way abruptly racing into the turn.

Footnotes
BLACKLINE, shuffled out of tight quarters at the start, was held up as part of the last flight while shifting to the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily
gained position inside foes nearing upper stretch, came around a tiring rival entering the lane, then angled back to the rail midstretch to challenge for
command and wrested a narrow advantage in time under left handed pressure. TY RAN A HOMER was rated off the second flight racing outside foes to the
first turn, advanced four wide through the backstretch, moved to challenge the leaders three wide on the far turn, contested the issue past midstretch but
couldn't match the winner's kick. HOT AND HEAVY broke inwards bumping DAKOTA'S DUDE while forcing that rival into the path of HONEY DONT, was
righted to track the pacesetter outside a rival to the backstretch, steadily advanced to press the issue racing into the far turn, dueled between foes past
midstretch but couldn't contain the top pair late. CAMMACK tracked off second flight between foes racing to the first turn, was eased back conceding some
position on the backstretch, was prompted to advance three deep between foes entering the far turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and had no
final kick. D'CRAZINESS tracked off the second flight along the inside under rating in the opening half, was prompted to advance along the inside entering
the far turn, shifted out nearing upper stretch to bid four wide between foes entering the lane but lacked a closing response. LITTLE MAZZY settled between
foes in the last flight early, was caught four wide racing into the far turn and offered no rally. ROUGH NIGHT tracked the pacesetter inside a rival as part of
the second flight racing to the backstretch and gave way nearing the lane. TOSS, steadied along the inside racing through the chute, continued to be rank
under restraint racing to the backstretch while shifting off the inside and proved no threat. HONEY DONT, brushed at the start, was urged to the lead along
the rail leaving the chute, set the pace on a clear margin racing to the far turn and gave out abruptly racing into upper stretch. DAKOTA'S DUDE, bumped at
the start, shifted inwards brushing HONEY DONT, was righted to track off the second flight outside rivals racing to the backstretch but dropped out early.

BUSTIN HEARTS angled to the inside tracking the leaders from out of striking distance racing to the turn, steadily gained momentum nearing upper stretch
to split foes three wide entering the lane, wrested the advantage midstretch and just maintained the lead to the end under firm encouragement. PASSION'S
IMAGE broke out, bumping PAPA'S ISLA DOLL, was righted to track the leaders outside foes in second flight racing to the turn, shifted inwards gaining
position between foes racing into upper stretch, then angled four wide in the closing stages while continuing willingly to the end. LIGHTS DOWN LOW
angled to the inside early dropping off the second flight, improved position along the inside racing into upper stretch, then shifted three wide in the closing
stags while continuing with interest to prevail for a share. STORMY BOSS settled last along the rail racing to the turn, saved ground on the bend, then
produced a stout rally to split foes making a belated bid and finished willingly along the rail to just miss for a share. FIFTYSHADESOGRAYCE, urged inside
foes dictating the pace on a narrow margin to the turn, dueled for command inside foes into the stretch and gave way late. MARVELLA tracked off the
second flight four wide in early stages and passed some tiring rivals late. FOXY LADY tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn and faded
into upper stretch. MARCHING IN, urged between foes prompting the pace, gave way in late stages. PAPA'S ISLA DOLL, bumped at the start, was urged to
terms with the first flight three wide prompting the pace racing to the turn, drifted wide nearing upper stretch and quickly emptied out.

CHARLITA broke readily, stalked the pacesetter along the inside under light reserve racing to the far turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch,
tipped out entering the lane to split foes when presented an opening and produced a steady late response to wrest the advantage in time under firm
handling. LUSTROUS, urged to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled for command into upper stretch, couldn't
contain the winner's bid but held grudgingly for the place honors. C'EST PARTI angled to the inside tracking the leaders from out of striking distance under
light reserve, shifted out on the far turn gaining position between foes, swung out four wide entering the lane, was carried out by PRETTY PRINCESS
nearing midstretch but continued willingly to gain a share. DANCING IN FIRE, forwardly placed stalking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch,
advanced to press the issue on the far turn, dueled into upper stretch but came up empty late. PRETTY PRINCESS tracked off the second flight while
shifting inwards a bit racing to the backstretch, steadily gained on the leaders three wide racing through the far turn to lodge a brief bid, then bore out racing
through the stretch while impeding a rival, then giving way. LOVELY TROPHY GIRL worked her way to the inside early tracking the leaders from out of
striking distance under light reserve but offered no rally. MAY BEAU broke outwards bumping BILL'S BEAUTY at the start, was settled along the inside to
the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch but had no closing bid. SILVER SKY SMOOTH settled between foes racing to the backstretch
and never gained contention. BODACIOUS BLEND settled inside foes while dropping out last to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. BILL'S
BEAUTY, bumped at the start while being shuffled back early, was caught four wide racing through the first turn, continued to advance outside foes to lodge
a brief bid four wide on the second bend but gave out abruptly racing into the lane.
