NINEONEONEPRAYER went to the front, pulled away and proved much the best. SOPHISTICATED GIRL stumbled at the start, racing in the rear, gained
ground and was a clear second at the wire. AREYOUINABAND raced within striking distance, forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for top two.
VIKING VOYAGE raced in the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort. LUCKY PRIORITY lacked early speed, moved up, but was no factor.
MALLORY'S HOME pressed the early pace and was finished early. STANG IT raced evenly near the back and showed little. HALF HEROINE always raced
near the back and was outrun.

Footnotes
LODE OF BLARNEY went to the front, drove clear and was kept to the task. UNDERDOG pressed the pace, raced outside around the final turn, couldn't
match strides with the winner, but was best of others. CUSTOM PANCHO pressed the early pace, racing behind the top two, followed them to the wire and
proved third best. DAVES FRIEND DEWEY raced in the middle of the pack, came around the second turn on the outside, made a mild bid, but was no
factor. COUNTERFEIT raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. CHIEF ALPHA raced in the middle of the pack and went to the wire
evenly. IRON MANDATE lacked early speed, moved up, but was never a threat. GOOD TIMES ROLLIN raced within contention and was finished early.
SWEEPERMAN void of early speed, raced wide around the first turn and was outrun. ASHLEYS BISCUIT lacked early speed and showed little.

MISS SOONER GIRL unhurried in the beginning, moved up around the final turn, drove clear down the stretch and held off a late running DIXIE LOVING for
the win. DIXIE LOVING lacked early speed, moved up around the second turn, rallied down the stretch, finished willingly and was getting to the winner.
WILL B LATE raced in the back of the pack in the early going, made a late gain, but proved no match for the top two. MISS MABELEE raced within
contention, took the lead at the 3/4 pole and weakened. JOZZY BELL broke out, raced in the middle of the pack, faded and passed tired ones late.
SALESGIRL raced in the middle of the field and faded. WIND ZEE challenged for the early advantage, dropped back and was no threat late. EYE ON THE
LADIES went to the front, drove clear and retreated to the rear.

SOUTHERN BEAUTY stalked the leader in the early going, moved up around the turn, took command down the stretch and was going away at the end.
ALOHA BETTY sprinted to the front, pulled away, proved no match late for the winner, but held on for second. GOLDEN SMILES unhurried in the
beginning, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a mild bid, but was no factor. MISS INVASIVE raced within striking distance, finished evenly and
was no threat. NAUTICAL GEM raced within contention, saved ground around the turn and faded. MISS BITTERS raced evenly near the back and was
never close. SMOKIN HOT MOMMA broke out, lost irons and was eased to wire, walked off.

Footnotes
ZIPZAPTIME broke sharp, went to the front, pulled away and was kept to the task. ROSSLARE HARBOUR lacked early speed, raced wide around the
second turn, made a steady gain and proved second best. SUNNYONASTORMYDAY pressed the early pace, saved ground around the final turn and
lacked a late kick. MINE INSPECTOR raced in the middle of the field, raced outside around the turn, made a bid and hung. BUCK DUANE lacked early
speed, moved up, but was no factor. TEN BROWNIES always raced near the back and was outrun. FLASHYBOY BOBB broke a step slow, quickly rushed
up near the front and faded. GENERAL TONE raced within striking distance and stopped.
