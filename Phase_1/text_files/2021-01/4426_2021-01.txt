coming on too late TAKE CHARGE CACKY speed to the front, gained the rail, dueled to stretch, empty. LIVELY KITTEN raced between horses to far turn,
duel to stretch, faltered late. LADY JENNEVIERE in tight start, far back to quarter pole, four wide run, late gain. BUTTER UP KATIE no speed to far turn but
leveled off with no late gain in the stretch. CLASSY LYNN outside early, came four wide past quarter pole, lost ground. QUEEN OF VERONA tracked inside,
