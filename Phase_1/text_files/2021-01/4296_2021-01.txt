Footnotes
MANDY wasn't far back three wide then rallied clear through late stretch. MAD MOMMA didn't break sharply, moved to the front from the inside midway on
the backstretch, held on to midstretch then faltered. MODERN VINTAGE broke slowly, steadied along the rail entering the turn then regained ground late.
VANESSA'S SECRET stumbled leaving the gate, moved up inside early and lacked the needed closing. MARLEE'S MAGIC was slow early, raced two wide
between rivals around the turn and lacked a rally. OCEAN CONQUEST was reluctant to load, was slow early, raced five wide around the turn and made up
some ground. LA SHIRIMP made the early lead, raced two wide around the turn and tired. FINDER ANGEL R V F advanced four wide on the turn then
flattened out. SNOW BLOSSOM was outrun six wide. SUNSHINE BAY was finished early.

Footnotes
LUNAR STAR didn't break sharply, wasn't far back, raced three wide around the turn, rallied to the front in late stretch and held. GIZMO'S DESTINY was
slow early, raced two wide around the turn, angled to the outside in midstretch and finished fastest. GOTTAFLATHAVEHER was bumped leaving the gate,
set or forced the pace two wide and gave way in the lane. REIN SUPREME had position in the three path, took over entering the stretch and faltered.
SLEIGHBELLE bobbled and ducked out into NANCY B leaving the gate, moved to a short lead along the rail after going a furlong then tired. NANCY B was
bumped into GOTTAFLATHAVEHER leaving the gate then wasn't a factor. GRACEYGAB was wide and outrun. ROCKIN RUTH pulled up lame on the turn
and was vanned off.
