Footnotes
STONEGATE pursued THE pacesetters inside, angled out on the turn, rallied clear in mid stretch and held on gamely from challenges on both sides. DON'T
RECALL lacked speed, advanced inside, moved out in the stretch, made a gradual gain but could not get by the winner. J WASS lagged far behind, bid
inside, was in tight briefly near the top of the stretch and continued well. GHOST FIGHTER chased outside, dropped back on the turn then passed fading
rivals. BUCKS ARE MOVING broke slowly, rushed to the front inside then came up empty in the stretch. GREENBACK raced close up three wide then gave
way readily. DR ZRADA forced the pace for half a mile then stopped abruptly.
