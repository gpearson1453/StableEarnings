Footnotes
KASSERINE PASS broke alertly, dueled up front while in the two path, shook off the other speed turning for home, drew well clear under firm handling.
SCARLET POSITION outrun in the early going, raced four out to five wide through the turn, split foes past the furlong marker to rally for the place, no threat
to the winner. FRILLS dueled up front while closest to the inside, failed to match strides with the winner while inside that one upper stretch, chased, caught
late for the place. SHOWIT void of early foot, dropped toward the inside through the turn, swerved back to out be widest when straightened for home, was
straightened with a right handed stick, improved position with some belated interest. SWEET TATUM back off the pace and the inside, came three wide into
the lane, continued one paced through the stretch in failing to menace. TEXAS MUSIC in the second group early, four out to five wide turning for home, also
lacked a closing response. VALIANT LADY raced in mid pack for three furlongs, tired in the drive. BIG AFFAIR away in good order, stalked the dueling
leaders in the three path, gave way from between rivals in the drive. SHAHARAZAD dwelt at the start, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
WAYAKIN broke alertly, set the pace toward the inside, turned back a bid from a rival exiting the turn, edged clear the final furlong under some steady
handling. FIVE DREAMS forwardly placed just off the inside, dropped to the rail late in the bend, steered out for room nearing the furlong marker carrying
AWESOME CHARGE out, finished willingly to be in plenty of time for the place. AIR SHOW prompted the pace outside, four wide into the far turn,
challenged outside the winner in the two path entering the stretch, flattened out in the drive, caught late for the place. AWESOME CHARGE settled off the
pace and the inside, three wide through the turn, continued to race one paced through the stretch while being floated out late in lacking a closing response.
JUNESANDRA back off the pace while racing outside, four wide midway on the turn, also lacked a response in the drive. JEDREK saved ground to no avail.
KING HENRIK pressed the winner from the outside the opening three furlongs and began to weaken. WESTERN PHAROAH last to leave, continued to race
back off the inside turn, swung out to be widest for the drive, failed to threaten. WHEELS fractious in the gate prior to the start, was finished early to finish
well back.

Footnotes
RATED R SUPERSTAR broke out, unhurried three wide, commenced his rally while remaining outside early in the far turn, came four wide into the lane,
firmly roused, drifted out, kicked down the leader under continued firm handling. CARIBBEAN (AUS) away well, set the pace inside, shook clear in upper
stretch, offered brief resistance when the winner challenged with less than a furlong remaining, proved no match for that one late, maintained daylight for the
place. HOME BASE prompted the pace off the inside, continued to apply pressure far turn, lost contact with the runner up into the stretch, continued to fall
back a bit past the furlong marker then came back for the show. ARRIVAL within striking distance off the inside early, came three wide through the final turn,
lodged a mild move to be a bit closer nearing the furlong grounds, flattened out in the final sixteenth to lose the show. JUMPER bothered at the start, three
wide when evenly paced through the first turn, mid pack in the run up the backstretch, lacked response in the drive. LAUGHING FOX last away, saved
ground to no avail. BLUERIDGE TRAVELER remained always back. INTREPID HEART slipped in losing his action soon after the start, was taken firmly in
hand, fell far back and was never close.

Footnotes
KEEP YOUR DISTANCE off the early pace outside, surged to the fore three wide midway on the turn, showed the way into the stretch, clear past the furlong
marker, increased advantage to the wire under steady handling. PRETTY BRITCHES broke alertly, set the pace inside, vied into the lane while continuing to
save ground entering the stretch, could not match strides with that one soon after, showed some good determination to hold the place. LIL MISS HOT
MESS broke in, bumped with ITS COLD IN DEHERE, raced back and outside, three wide through the turn, rallied, getting to the runner up while well out in
the strip. ITS COLD IN DEHERE bumped at the break, void of speed well out in the strip, came four out to five wide for the drive, mild late interest to
improve a couple of positions. LAY M OUT back off the pace and the inside, four wide exiting the turn while improving slightly, flattened out in the final
furlong. SHACKLEFORD COUNTY off slowly, trailed well back early as a result, improved by passing tiring rivals, no real threat. MADISON WAY in mid
pack early while saving ground into the turn, moved to be three wide for the drive, lacked a closing response. TONI ANN'S MIRACLE failed to menace while
racing just off the inside. TAKE CHARGE ERICA pressed the issue early off the rail, dueled through the turn, stopped in the drive. FREE was finished after a
half while along the inside.

Footnotes
WILL'S SECRET allowed the pace to go early while off the inside, continued to be patiently handled in the run up the backstretch, ranged up three then four
wide late in the final turn, put a head in front when straightened for home then drew strongly clear the final sixteenth under an intermittent right handed stick
in a solid effort. COACH squeezed back in tight quarters soon after the start, fell back to trail early, moved out and was three wide first turn, advanced in the
three path to challenge in the far bend, fell back off the winner turning for home, came back for the place spot late. JOY'S ROCKET bumped soundly with
NOVEL SQUALL just after the start, recovered to contest the issue up front closest to the inside, pressed in the run up the backstretch, narrowly held the
advantage late in the final turn, offered but brief resistance to the winner the final furlong, well clear for the second spot late, faltered to lose that position in
the final couple of strides. SYLVIA Q broke on top, worked way to the front while four wide into the first turn, narrowly set the pace off the inside, showed the
way into the far turn in the two path, began to falter when headed soon after. LADY LILLY broke well, contested the issue early, fell back before a half, had
nothing for the drive. NOVEL SQUALL exchanged sound bump with JOY'S ROCKET just after the break, taken back in hand, moved outside, four wide
through the second turn, came up empty for the drive.

Footnotes
THE MARY ROSE never far back, raced four wide through the turn when moving closer wore down opponents on the outside to the wire under steady
handling. PRESLEY broke alertly, pressed the issue early off the inside, dueled through the turn in the two path, vied past the furlong marker while between
horses and inside the winner, gave ground grudgingly to that one late, held the place late. HISSY MISSY lacked early speed, raced three wide through the
turn, advanced into the lane, in some traffic then split foes late, finished willingly to be gaining for the place spot. LIL TATER lacked early foot, saved some
ground early in the turn, switched to the far outside for the drive, finished willingly while too late. OOCHIE forwardly placed for a half, weakened in the drive.
TAILORBESWIFT away in good order, set or forced the pace up the backstretch, dueled through the bend then faltered in the drive. TOO PRETTY veered
out at the start, toward the front while racing outside, five wide into the turn, four wide exiting then came up empty for the stretch run. FIVE QUEENS in the
second flight early while off the inside, tired in the drive. MANY SWEET TREATS steadily faded inside. BETTYANN back off the pace well wide, five path
through the turn, failed to muster a rally. GUEST IN MY HEART void of speed while inside, two path into the lane, remained back. TRIPLE HAPPY off a step
slow, remained always back, jogged in.

Footnotes
LUTESCOOT N BOOGIE tracked the leaders in the two path, angled out three wide turning for home, challenged approaching the furlong marker outside
the two leaders, kicked well clear under pressure. NORTHERN DIAMOND lacked early foot, swung out four to five wide turning for home, finished willingly
to edge clear for the place, no match for the winner. RIGHT TRAPPE broke a step slow, raced well back, rallied five wide into the lane, also was going well
at the end while widest for the drive. SHES GOT IT prompted the leaders while in the three path, had little left for the stretch run. NAVY LADY broke well,
showed the way up the backstretch, vied through the turn, weakened in the drive. FREEDOM BOUND off a step slow, in mid pack while just off the inside, in
some traffic, three wide turning into the stretch, failed to muster a kick. RENEGADE SUNSET fractious while loading, was never a serious threat while also
one pace. DREAM PRINCESS remained back in failing to menace. PERFECTIONTODETAIL broke alertly, pressed off the inside, dueled turn in the two
path, gave way. LITTLE SURE SHOT settled in mid pack early while racing three wide, backed up in the drive. FILLY RAY CYRUS off slowly, trailed,
showed little.

Footnotes
FRANK'S ROCKETTE broke well, settled just off the pace in the three path, engaged the leader turning for home, dueled past the furlong marker, wore that
foe down under a firm hand ride to be edging away late. AMY'S CHALLENGE also away in good order, took control soon after, showed the way into and
then through the turn, set down for the drive, responded when the winner came alongside upper stretch, proved stubborn to the end, clearly second best.
WILDWOOD'S BEAUTY lacked speed, moved outside, was four wide exiting the turn, along for the show, no threat to the top two. SHESOMAJESTIC broke
out a bit, was straightened to race off the pace, continued in even fashion to the stretch, lacked a significant late response while remaining closest to the
inside. BEST KEPT SECRET last away while still breaking with the field, raced back early, moved a bit closer when four wide in the turn, flattened in the
drive. MAGIC DANCE in the second group early, was finished before a half off the inside.

Footnotes
SECRET COURIER carried out at the break, was righted to be never far back off the inside, took over entering the stretch, clear, kept to task. FASTLY
steadied just after the start to fall back and trail, continued well back into the turn, moved out for the drive, closed full of run to be up late for the place.
AMERICAN MANDATE broke sharp, fell back off the pace, checked up in tight quarters into the turn, advanced to be closest to the winner a furlong out, had
little for that one late, caught in the final strides for the place. BACKSHOT void of speed, continued back toward the inside midway on the turn, angled out to
be four then five wide into the lane, displayed a modest amout of late interest to improve position. ABUNDANT forwardly placed inside, had little left for the
drive. IMPOSSIBLE TASK lacked early foot, made little impact in the two path. BACKGROUND broke out, was finished after a half. LONELY PRIVATE
saved ground, was not a factor. PIRATE RICK sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace, gave way when headed into the lane. CHASE TRACKER
carried out start, in some early traffic, trailed home.
