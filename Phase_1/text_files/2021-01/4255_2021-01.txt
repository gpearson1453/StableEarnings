Footnotes
LIBERTARIAN, a bit outpaced despite between prompted to contend in the opening quarter, shifted outside foes on the turn gathering momentum,
advanced on the leaders four wide racing into upper stretch and found a steady late response to wrest the advantage leaving the furlong marker and go
clear under firm left handed pressure. WAR GIANT was rated between foes tracking off the first flight in the opening quarter, briefly awaited an opening
entering the bend, split foes nearing upper stretch, shifted to the inside to go clear entering the lane but couldn't fend off the winner. MALIO'S angled
inwards while being urged to force the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn, dueled for command between foes in upper stretch and
faded in the last furlong. GETTININTOMISCHIEF tracked just off the first flight outside rivals racing through the backstretch, advanced to challenge four
wide into the turn but came up empty entering upper stretch. FIVE STAR CREEK, urged inside a rival disputing the pace while shifting to the rail racing
through the backstretch, was through after a half. PASSIONATE HACHI tracked off the first flight inside foes, shifted off the inside on the turn but soon
emptied out.

Footnotes
TONY SMALL tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn, shifted out three wide in upper stretch steadily advancing to challenge and prevailed
in time under firm handling. PAPAJUDGY broke sharply, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin racing into the bend, resisted a rival's
challenge to maintain a slim advantage past midstretch but couldn't contain the winner while edging rivals for the place honors. FREE FLAYME, prominent
in the four path in the opening quarter prompting the leader, shifted inwards entering the turn to press the issue past midstretch but was outfinished by the
top pair. JACK B WINKLE tracked off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn, advanced in tandem with the eventual winner into upper stretch,
then altered course to the four path leaving the sixteenth marker while continuing willingly to just miss for a share. ROCK THE PARK settled outside foes
racing last to the turn, angled out four wide nearing the lane and made some belated progress. PRIZED WARRIOR settled inside foes in the last flight racing
into the turn and never gained contention. STEADILY tracked just off the second flight three wide racing through the backstretch, continued in brief pursuit in
that path into the turn but came up empty after a half.

Footnotes
SHE DAZZLE broke readily to track the pacesetter outside a rival from just out of striking position racing to the turn, steadily advanced on that rival to
challenge for command nearing upper stretch, took over entering the lane and drove clear. NORA RADD broke sharply, angled to the inside dictating the
pace on a clear margin into the turn but proved no match when confronted by the winner while best of the others. COOL O TOOLE settled between foes in
the last flight, split rivals three wide nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to secure a share. D FLAT WHITE settled inside rivals in the last flight
early, advanced through close quarters along the rail nearing upper stretch to improve position to late stages. LOVELY LAURA broke awkwardly while
ducking inwards losing ground to the field, was prompted to make brief progress four wide racing into the turn but came up empty in the drive. SMOOTH
DANCER tracked the pace inside rivals in second flight and gave way early. VIRGINIA DOZE tracked off the second flight three wide in the opening stages,
made brief progress in that path between foes into the turn but emptied out abruptly after a half.

TUNE IN was rated along the inside tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking position racing to the far turn, came through inside foes when presented
an opening midstretch to wrest the advantage and went clear under firm encouragement. SAUCY DEREK stalked just off the pacesetter under light rating in
the two path racing to the backstretch, advanced to press that foe nearing upper stretch, was carried out by FOOD AND WINE leaving midstretch, shifted
inwards into the path of that rival despite left handed pressure approaching the sixteenth marker but continued willingly to prevail for the place honors. JUAN
PABLO was settled in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside after a half, gained some position between foes nearing upper stretch,
angled inside rivals midstretch and continued with interest while just missing for second. OBIWAN tracked off the second flight three wide between foes,
advanced four wide into upper stretch but had no final kick. MIGHTY GHOST angled to the inside to track off the second flight racing to the backstretch,
continued between foes on the far turn, shifted inside nearing the lane but had no closing bid. FOOD AND WINE sped to the lead along the inside, dictated
the pace on a clear margin through the backstretch, was roused to resist a rival's bid racing into the lane, ducked out leaving midstretch momentarily
impeding that rival, then was steadied off that foe and quickly came up empty. BUFFALO MAX settled well off the field racing to the backstretch and failed to
menace. ELGAR tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch and steadily faded into the far turn. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
PAPA JOEL tracked off the first flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, angled in entering the far turn, shifted to the rail nearing upper stretch
advancing inside the pacesetter to challenge that foe nearing midstretch, wrested the advantage and went clear under firm handling. THANK YOU settled
outside foes racing three, then four wide into the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path racing into the far turn, was fanned five wide into the
lane but continued with interest outside foes to prevail narrowly for the place honors in time. TIP SHEET, forwardly placed along the rail prompting the pace,
conceded the lead racing into the backstretch, switched outside the pacesetter after a half, was urged to press the issue between foes racing into the far
turn and weakened in late stages while prevailing for a share. DAHOG angled to the inside early tracking off the first flight, saved ground to the lane and
made some mild progress inside foes late. MEILLEUR, urged to terms with the first flight three wide racing to the first turn, was urged clear while angling to
the inside racing into the backstretch, set the pace just off the inside to the far turn, dueled for command inside foes, then between rivals into upper stretch
and gave out in late stages. UNSPOILED MOMENTS, reserved last to the backstretch near the inside, shifted out in late stages but had no rally. BRANDT,
unhurried between foes dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, never gained contention. KALEIDOSCOPE KID, in touch with the first flight
between foes racing to the first turn, was eased off the leaders approaching the backstretch to track just off those foes, shifted out three wide nearing the far
turn while being urged to lodge a brief bid but came up empty racing into upper stretch.

LOGIC N REASON gained a forward placing stalking the pacesetter under light reserve between foes leading the second flight to the far turn, was roused
racing into the stretch to wrest the advantage late and went clear nearing the wire under firm encouragement. NO MO TEMPER was rated three deep as
part of the second flight tracking just off the pacesetter to the far turn, was prompted in that path between foes to challenge racing into upper stretch,
couldn't match the winner late but edged a rival for the place honors. CLASSY WOMAN broke sharply, dictated the pace along the inside while going well
clear on the backstretch, held sway to midstretch, then yielded nearing the sixteenth marker. A K'S SONG hopped at the start, was quickly collected while
working her way to the inside tracking off the second flight, shifted out on the far turn while being prompted to advance between foes, then gained some
position in the closing stages while racing in close quarters. HERE COMES JACKIE was rated off the second flight between foes racing to the far turn and
continued evenly three deep in the closing stages. GARDENISTA was rated tracking just off the pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second flight, saved
ground to upper stretch, was roused to advance in tight quarters past midstretch and was taken in hand nearing the wire when losing her path.
REPATRIATED GEM (GB), reserved between foes while dropping out last racing to the backstretch, was prompted to split foes on the far turn, angled five
wide entering the lane but had no closing bid. NEW AND IMPROVED tracked off the second flight outside foes under light rating to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance while being caught four wide racing into the far turn and steadily faded racing into the lane.

Footnotes
MIZZEN AIR broke readily to gain a forward placing stalking just off the leaders between foes into the backstretch, split foes just off the inside to advance on
the pacesetter nearing upper stretch and wore down that rival in time under firm handling. FUN PADDY angled to the inside early tracking off the first flight,
came through inside foes to challenge for command when presented an opening midway through the backstretch, dictated terms on a narrow margin into
the far turn, edged clear between calls racing into upper stretch, continued grudgingly maintaining the advantage to late stages but just failed to contain the
winner. DARLINDIVA, urged inside rivals disputing the pace into the backstretch, shifted off the rail after a half, continued to prompt the leader to the second
bend and faded three wide into the lane while prevailing for a share. ALEXBABE settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and improved position racing
four wide into the stretch while no real threat. DILLY DOES IT was rated off the first flight between foes in the opening half, angled in entering the far turn to
make some brief progress but faded in the drive. QUEEN ROLLER ducked in at the start impeding WEST HORIZEN, was righted, then urged between foes
prompting the pace into the backstretch and gave way racing into the far turn. WEST HORIZEN, forced in at the start, settled along the inside racing to the
backstretch and never gained contention. ELEGANT ROSE, caught four wide racing to the first turn, dropped back early. INEDATEQUILA, urged to contend
three wide between foes racing to the first turn, was fanned four wide into the backstretch and gave way after a half.

Footnotes
QUALITY STEP, unhurried outside foes in the opening stages, was forced out five wide by GLAD ROCK (GER) entering the first turn, was quickly collected,
then prompted to advance four wide through the backstretch to gain contention, moved to challenge for command three deep racing through the far turn,
gained the advantage racing past midstretch and went clear under firm encouragement. THE BOSS FACTOR stalked just off the first flight between foes to
the backstretch, angled in on the far turn, tipped out splitting rivals racing into upper stretch and proved best of the others. BIG TALL DAWG, urged three
wide to gain terms with the leaders racing to the first turn, drifted out entering the bend, was prompted to terms with the pacesetter on the backstretch,
pressed the issue between foes into the far turn, dueled inside the winner to upper stretch and yielded in the lane. SHENDAM (FR) tracked off the second
flight along the inside to the backstretch, switched out three, then four wide while being prompted to advance into the stretch but finished evenly late. FADE
AWAY was rated off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch and continued evenly between foes to gain some position racing into upper
stretch. RED CAT (CHI) tracked off the first flight while angling to the inside, was prompted to advance after a half, was steadied out of tight quarters
entering the far turn, then angled out five wide in the lane while failing to regain contention. JARETH settled last near the inside racing to the backstretch
and never gained contention. GLAD ROCK (GER), pulling along the inside early, switched out with an abrupt move crossing into the path of the eventual
winner while being forced wide avoiding BIG TALL DAWG entering the first turn, was urged three deep through the backstretch to lodge an early bid racing
into the far turn but soon emptied out. THAT'S BUCKBEAK, urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, dueled inside
foes through the backstretch and gave way abruptly racing into the far turn.

WILDCAT MERRY, pulling three deep tracking just off the leaders in the opening stages, made a steady advance to gain terms with the leaders on the turn
on her own courage, then was roused clear leaving the furlong marker to prove best. DON'T MAKE ME BEG, urged inside foes disputing the pace through
the backstretch into the turn, dueled for command into upper stretch but proved no match. SNIPER SIS tracked off the second flight between foes, shifted
three wide racing into the bend and improved position while prevailing for a share. LA WAPA tracked off the second flight racing four wide into the turn and
continued evenly in that path late. ASTROMELIA tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked a closing response.
STAMINA PRINCESS settled between foes in early stages and never seriously menaced. BONSAI BENNY flashed brief pace between foes and emptied
out early. BOW MAKER was held up along the inside racing to the turn and had no closing bid. PRINCES DYNAMITE, off a bit slowly, was hustled to the
lead outside foes in the opening quarter but emptied out after a half. LITTLE MARIA broke awkwardly, raced wide to the turn and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
LUCY'S TOWN, reserved near the back while shifting off the inside, swung out five wide racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance, angled
inside foes nearing upper stretch to gain position between foes, altered course entering upper stretch to split foes just off the inside and was roused through
close quarters in late stages to just strike the front in time in a stout rally under brisk handling. POSTINO'S IDOL was rated off the second flight near the
inside in the opening half, gathered momentum inside foes entering the far turn, swung out four wide entering the stretch advancing to challenge for
command and was just outkicked. CATSOUTOFTHEBAG tracked the leader inside a rival as part of the second flight, saved ground through the far turn,
shifted out to bid between foes midstretch but was outkicked by the top pair. MAGIC HATTER settled last racing to the far turn, swung out to the six path in
upper stretch and made some belated progress. EYE ON THE FINISH, reserved along the inside racing to the far turn, shifted out entering the lane, then
altered course avoiding traffic in late stages while lacking the needed final kick. CLASSICAL MAGIC, urged to a forward placing prompting the pacesetter to
the far turn, gave way into the lane. ELLA'S ISLAND sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace along the rail to upper stretch and abruptly gave out
in late stages. MAD GRACE tracked off the second flight outside a rival, was prompted to lodge a brief, three wide bid on the far turn but quickly came up
empty. KANFU, urged to forward placing three deep racing to the backstretch, was through after a half. DONNAMEUP tracked the pace outside foes off the
second flight and faded early.
