BOUNDARY BAY pressed the pace, challenged three across on the turn, was carried out, closed steadily, got up near the eighth pole, inched away and
held under strong urging. CATS SURFIN was unhurried early, raced in the back, closed willingly, shifted out mid stretch and was gaining fast late.
RAMBLIN' MAN dueled to the turn, swung wide, inched away, faltered near the sixteenth pole and held safely for show. MY LUCKY MARK raced mid pack
outside, went seven wide at the top of the stretch, bid and came up empty. OUT FOR JUSTICE bumped at the start and did not threaten in an even effort.
WHATSITTOYA broke out and bumped at the start, dueled inside to the turn and stopped.

wide, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and offered a mild bid to improve position. MENSCH set a pressured pace, inched away on the turn, tired and

led briefly, leveled off and faded. COUNT HU pressed the pace to the second turn, tired and gave way. SUPER DAY went widest in the drive and improved

Footnotes
FAITH IN EXCESS lagged early, closed steadily and wore down her rivals to get up in the final strides. FICETY LADY was never far off the pace, bid inside
leaving the turn, got up past the sixteenth pole and was outfinished in a good effort. BABY ROSE set the pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead, faltered
inside the sixteenth pole and held safely for show. WILLINLILVILLIAN lagged early, went twelve wide entering the stretch and closed well. MERITTRIS
showed good early speed, swung wide on the turn, fell back and finished evenly. DISLITLEAGLECANFLY pressed the pace, bid inside on the turn and
came up empty. HER NAME IS UM showed speed to the turn and gave way. CALIFORNIA JEWELS was not a factor. HONG KONG FLEW broke slowly
and showed little. LITTLE MOO pressed the pace and stopped into the turn. FARISHTA pulled up and was vanned off.
