STREET MACHINE set the pace up the backstretch, led from the two path into the stretch and drew away under urging. BOB AGAIN chased off the rail,
three wide into the lane, lacked the needed late punch but bested the rest. SOUND CHECKERS broke out and bumped rival at the start, chased from the
inside to the lane and was outkicked for the place. IMPEACHMENT ACE stalked a bit off the rail, traveled two to three wide into the stretch and went evenly
through the final furlong. EL REGALO F G broke out and bumped both sides leaving the gate, angled to the inside early on the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn and lacked any response. ARTCRILIC bumped both sides leaving the gate, raced outside a rival then between foes on the turn, came three
wide into the stretch and never rallied. BERRACO bumped at the start, raced off the rail, three deep on the turn, four wide and outside a rival into the stretch
and had little left for the final furlong.

won easily. EVENING REWARD tracked a bit off the rail, raced two wide then three wide leaving the turn and proved second best. ANGRY BOBBY settled
early near the inside, came two wide into the stretch and never produced a bid. LAKE SHOW tracked off the rail in the early stages, angled in on the turn,
shifted out out entering the stretch and could not rally. DARING WAYS stumbled badly and outward at the start, trailed the field off the rail into the lane and
never threatened. BRAGGART chased from off the rail, angled in on the turn and weakened in the late stages.

ACHIEVED dueled from the inside, cleared leaving the turn and moved out into the two path, met the challenge from SWISS CHEESE in the lane and held
gamely. SWISS CHEESE stalked near the rail to the stretch, bid inside of ACHIEVED and fought to the wire but could not get by. QUANTUM FORCE off a
bit slow to begin, settled down along the fence, angled out into the three path, summoned a late rally and closed the gap on the top pair while earning the
show. FANCY TERRACE dueled from the outside, lost the contact with the leader into the stretch and weakened. FANDAREL DANCER chased outside a
rival two wide into the lane and lacked a rally. BOTTLE ROCKET allowed to settle up the backstretch, entered the turn three wide and exited two wide and
failed to threaten. Due to a timer malfunction the third race was hand-timed and no fractions were recorded.
