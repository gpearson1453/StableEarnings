Footnotes
LONG BLADE, urged to the gain a narrow advantage in the opening stages while shifting off the rail, shook clear nearing upper stretch while angling out to
the three path and held sway to the end under firm encouragement. SAMMY'S MINESHAFT settled last just off the inside racing to the turn, angled out four
wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady late bid to secure the place honors. JUNCTION, urged along four wide, then three wide into the turn
prompting a rival's pace, gave way into upper stretch. KEEP THE COMMISH made brief pursuit of the pacesetter between foes, then along the inside racing
into the turn and gave way nearing the lane. BERLINER vied between foes racing to the turn, was gathered up by his rider racing through the stretch while
dropping out last, then was vanned off the course following the race.

Footnotes
FORWARD MOTION tracked just off the first flight near the inside under light rating in the opening quarter, shifted out to gain terms with the first flight
between foes just off the inside nearing the turn pressing the issue, edged forward to a narrow advantage entering the turn, moved clear nearing upper
stretch and held sway on a widening margin to the end under mild urging while his rider flashed his whip right handed. LEGACY AZTECA tracked just off the
leaders four wide, then five wide racing into the turn, continued four deep into upper stretch and proved best of the others. CHESTER MON settled off the
leaders along the inside in the opening stages, swung out five wide leaving the midway point of the turn and continued to gain some position in that path to
late stages. ROCKYSBUCKAROO, disputed the pace inside rivals from the outset, angled to the rail after leaving the gap to press the issue inside the
eventual winner racing into the turn, then gave way nearing upper stretch. SMOKY BLUES, in touch with the leaders between foes prompting the pace from
the outset, lost terms with the winner entering the bend and gave way nearing the lane. DANG IT CASSIE settled last while shifting a bit off the inside but
failed to menace. CHASINGTHEGAME vied briefly with the first flight three wide between foes racing through the backstretch but retreated early.

Footnotes
WICKED WITCH, firmly rated between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, gradually gained contention racing into the far turn, briefly awaited an
opening leaving the five sixteenths marker, then was prompted to split foes just off the rail to bid inside the pacesetter racing into upper stretch and went
clear through the lane under firm left handed encouragement. GLOBALPRINCESSCOCO tracked off the first flight outside foes racing to the backstretch,
advanced on the leaders four wide nearing upper stretch to challenge for command but proved no match for the winner. TREASURE CAT, reserved outside
foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out five wide on the far turn while being urged to gain terms with the leaders, raced in that path into
upper stretch and had no final kick while continuing well enough to earn a share. MIGHTY FROSTY, pulling inside foes racing into the first turn, was urged
clear entering the backstretch, opened a commanding advantage after a half, set the pace to upper stretch while shifting out nearing the lane but gave out
once headed by the winner. CAT CAY, in touch with the first flight racing to the first turn, was eased off the pacesetter entering the backstretch to track that
rival along the inside, was prompted to lodge a brief bid along the rail nearing upper stretch but proved empty in the drive. AWESOME THE MARIA
forwardly placed prompting the pace three deep into the backstretch, conceded the lead to track the pacesetter outside a rival to the second bend, was
urged to make brief progress between foes but quickly came up empty. GUILTY LADY, reserved out of close quarters along the inside, dropped out early.

Footnotes
MULLED WINE, unhurried along the inside in the opening stages, shifted out three deep nearing the turn moving to terms with rivals in second flight, was
prompted to advance in that path between foes racing through the turn to challenge for command in upper stretch, wrested the advantage and edged clear
under firm right handed pressure. DIG IN, reserved in early stages while switching outside rivals, was prompted to advance four wide racing into the turn,
continued to advance in tandem with the eventual winner to upper stretch but proved only second best in the closing stages. THE EXCEPTION angled
inwards to track between foes just off the leaders racing into the turn, angled to the rail when presented an opening nearing upper stretch to bid for
command inside rivals but lacked the needed final kick while edging a rival for a share. GETTININTOMISCHIEF angled inwards in the opening stages to
force the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch, dueled for command into the while gaining a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch but
weakened nearing the furlong marker. NATION U S A tracked off the first flight outside rivals in the opening stages, was prompted to lodge a brief bid three
deep between foes entering the turn but quickly came up empty. JOHNNYTHETIREMAN tracked off the first flight along the inside but faded from contention
early. K C TWOSTEP, urged to the lead inside a rival disputing the pace, angled to the rail pressing the issue racing through the backstretch and emptied
out racing into the turn.

TINK, forwardly placed attending a rival's pace racing to the first turn, took over entering the backstretch to dictate the pace on a narrow margin remaining a
bit off the rail, went clear racing into the far turn, held sway on a clear margin to midstretch and just lasted while steadily losing momentum when switching
her leads repeatedly in the final sixteenth to prevail under stout right handed encouragement. TEACHER DRAMA tracked off the first flight along the inside
in early stages, found her best stride racing along the rail in upper stretch and steadily closed the gap inside the winner to just miss. CHIT CHAT GIRL
tracked off the second flight between foes in opening stages, switched out nearing the backstretch advanced to contention three deep between foes after a
half, continued in that path in pursuit of the winner into upper stretch but flattened in the drive. PREMIER JUSTICE, forwardly placed tracking the pacesetter
outside the eventual winner into the backstretch, continued on terms with that foe to the second bend and steadily faded through the far turn. LASTING
JOY, caught five wide racing to the backstretch, offered no rally. LITTLE MARIA, caught four wide between foes racing to the backstretch, faded from
contention early. KITTY JAK, urged to gain a brief lead along the rail, emptied out early.

SIMPLY GREAT was settled last in the opening stages, advanced to contention racing five wide into the turn, moved to challenge for command four wide in
upper stretch and edged clear under firm right handed encouragement. G Q GIRL tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn, awaited an
opening while shifting about racing into upper stretch, then angled out five wide in the closing stages to prevail for the place honors. TOLLY HO stalked just
outside the first flight under light rating in the opening stages, advanced in that path on the turn to challenge for command between foes in upper stretch but
flattened out late. SUPER TWENTY FIVE, urged inside foes disputing the pace, dueled for command into upper stretch and gave way late. PURE PRAISE
vied for command between foes pressing the pace from the outset into the turn, then gave way in late stages. INDIAN FEATHER, brushed by TOLLY HO in
early stages, dropped off the leaders early and failed to menace thereafter. PAPA REGALA, urged three wide between foes prompting the pace, gave way
early.

CUESTION DE TIEMPO broke readily, tracked the pacesetter along the rail while being prompted to maintain striking distance racing into the turn, came
through inside that foe when presented an opening to challenge for command in upper stretch and narrowly prevailed in time under firm right handed
encouragement. KITCHEN FIRE, urged to the lead along the inside, set the pace on a clear margin into the turn, shifted off the inside in upper stretch and
gamely resisted the winner but proved only second best. BACKTOHISROOTS angled inwards in early stages to track just off the pacesetter between foes,
shifted three wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to the end to close the gap. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE tracked off the second flight near the
inside in the opening stages, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued to make a mild gain. OUTRAGEOUS BET settled last in early stages
and never gained striking distance. NEW YORK'S FINEST, urged to a forward placing a rival's prompting pace, gave way early. MOOJI MOO JR. made
brief pursuit of the leaders four wide in the opening stages but emptied out early.

Footnotes
GERRI B broke sharply, angled inwards dictating the pace just outside a rival on a narrow margin in the opening stages, forged clear while shifting to the
inside nearing upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm left handed pressure. RED VENUS, urged inside the eventual winner prompting the pace
from the outset into the turn, lost some ground to that foe on the turn, switched out racing into upper stretch and proved best of the others. FLORADO
tracked just off the first flight between foes in the opening stages, made brief pursuit of the top pair racing into the turn but steadily faded into upper stretch.
POSITIVE POWER tracked off the second flight in the opening stages, angled to the rail entering the turn while being prompted to advance but had no
closing bid. TRASH PANDA tracked off the second flight outside foes early, shifted out four wide racing through the turn and steadily faded. SWEET BABY
GIRL was outpaced between foes early and proved no threat. FERLAND'S PROSPECT proved no factor. RENEESINHEAVEN made brief pursuit of the
pacesetter racing four to the turn but gave way early.
