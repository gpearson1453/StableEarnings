Footnotes
WARM IT UP unhurried in the beginning, raced off the rail and four wide into the turn, angled in around the bend and traveled two wide nearing the eighth
pole, rallied through the lane and reeled in HAVASU HUNNI to get up in the final strides. HAVASU HUNNI away quickly from the outside, angled over to the
rail and set the pace to the turn, held a comfortable lead and raced clear to the sixteenth pole but was challenged late and could not contain the winner.
REDHOTNREADYTOWED chased the speed two wide around the turn, drifted out into the stretch and went evenly through the final furlong. MERGIE
TROID off a bit slow to begin, settled along the inside, looked to advance but lacked room near the fence and checked, angled outside that rival and
improved position. SPACERIKA a bit off rail in the early going, saved ground tucked inside on the turn and into the stretch and weakened in the late stages.
LAST DANCE BELLA off the rail in the early going, angled out into the three path, came back inward in the stretch and never rallied.

Footnotes
ROYAL BAR vied three deep for the lead, kicked clear into the stretch and held safely. BALLYCASTLE stalked off the rail, rallied in the stretch, closed well
but could not reach the winner. BAJA WARRIOR raced off the pace and off the rail in the beginning, took the turn two wide and finished willingly to earn the
show. DARING WAYS traveled along the inside, stalked saving the ground to the stretch, came out a bit and showed a mild response to pass tired foes.
BRAVE COURT vied for command from the inside, dueled with ROYAL BAR around the turn and gave way in the lane. DEVILS GAME vied between rivals
up the backstretch, failed to match strides and chased the top pair into the lane and tire after. Due to a timer malfunction the second race was hand-timed
and no fractions were recorded.
