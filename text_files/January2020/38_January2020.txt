Footnotes
STARRY SKY made the early pace in the two path, regained command two wide entering the far turn, drew out through the lane and was kept to urging. O
K GAME ON bobbled slightly leaving the gate, settled early, came out into the two path on the final turn and gained mildly outside through the lane.
SCOOTER BUSKIE broke sharply, pressed in the three path outside the winner early, fell back before a half then continued to fade to the end. BEN'S
ECLIPTICAL steadied behind the winner while in tight along the rail nearing and onto the backstretch, was sent to the front before going a half and was
finished after three-quarters. LACCO AMENO hesitated in the gate at the break then couldn't catch up. CHANGE THE IMAGE was reluctant to load, wasn't
far back three wide around the first turn and was finished after a half.

Footnotes
SEPICATO set the pace along the inside of a rival, shook clear of that foe approaching the far turn, drew further clear when shifted to the three path turning
for home, and was driven to the wire. SWINGING STAR stalked from the pocket, saved ground around both turns and attempted a rail bid inside of the
leader approaching the furlong, but did not have enough to gain even terms, and was second best. JONATHANTOQUICK raced two wide between horses
in midpack, shifted to the four path into the the lane, then stayed on mildly. EVEN THUNDER prompted the pace setter from the three path around the first
turn, then the two path down the backstretch, but failed to keep pace approaching the far turn, then weakened through the lane. FEDERAL DOMINANCE
settled off the pace into the first turn, was caught four wide while outside of rivals around that bend, advanced to midpack into the backstretch, but was
caught three to four wide around the far turn and failed to make an impact. DECISION DAY trailed throughout and was never involved.

made up ground along the inside. POLAR JET pressed outside the early leader in the three path, was carried out entering the stretch, was bumped
repeatedly through the lane and gave way. WHOSE BABY IS THAT was getting out on the backstretch while making the early pace, bore out entering the
stretch then repeatedly bore out into POLAR JET through the lane. IT'S NOT FUNNY ducked out into the winner leaving the gate, wasn't far back in the four

Footnotes
FLIRTATION WALK dueled inside of TIKA while staying in the three path, forged clear from that foe while drifting out approaching the quarter pole, came
into the lane in the five path, then added to her margin through the lane while continuing to bear outwards. TIKA dueled outside of FLIRTATION WALK into
the turn while being kept in the four path by that rival, failed to keep pace with her approaching the quarter pole, shifted inwards as that foe bore out in upper
stretch, but had no rerally, and held place. BAYANNE raced outside of a rival while beind kept in the six path, shifted to the five path and gained to striking
position in the turn, sustained a grinding bid while getting outpaced by the leader in upper stretch, but did not have enough to achieve place. LILIA settled
far off the pace setters, then stayed on mildly through the lane while hanging on her left lead, but failed to make an impact. FIDDLER had a slow start,
trailed the field to the turn, saved ground while passing a struggling rival around the bend, then passed a tired rival in the stretch without threatening.
LOLA'S KISSES tracked the leading duelers from inside of rival while staying in the five path, angled down to the rail into the turn, advanced to the pocket
around the bend, but lacked a bid in upper stretch and weakened passiing the furlong pole. LAST GREAT was outrun, weakened into the turn, then
struggled to finish through the lane and jogged across the wire.

MIDNIGHT ACT moved to a clear lead into the first turn, stayed just out from the rail under rating, ran clear again just before a mile then held. FINAL
PROSPECT wasn't far back while three wide between horses, made a late run outside and closed a gap in the final yards. PAL CAL moved to press outside
the winner on the backstretch, gave his best on the final turn but weakened in the lane. SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR wasn't far back between horses early,
raced two wide into the far turn then weakened in the lane. THEYALLCOMEHOME was slow early, was hustled closer along the rail on the backstretch but
lacked a further response. TELLING YOU TWICE wasn't far back three wide around the first turn, was caught four wide into the far turn then stopped.

SUPER DONNA G was a bit fractious in the gate, tracked the early duelers from the four path, commenced a rally passing the quarter pole, bid for the lead
passing the furlong marker, dueled as CULLINAN battled on, and prevailed a few steps before the wire. CULLINAN dueled outside of ROCKFORD GIRL
while being kept in the three path by that rival, handily took over from that foe into the turn, built a clear lead around the bend, met a challenge from SUPER
DONNA G passing the furlong marker, dug in, but was bested as the rider stopped driving a few steps before the wire. ROCKFORD GIRL was hustled from
the gate for early position, dueled inside of a rival while staying in the two path, but was put to a drive while failing to keep pace with that foe into the turn,
and subsequently weakened. PRINCESS JAVONCIA was always outrun and showed little.

TRINKET prompted the pace setter while staying in the five path, inched closer at the quarter pole, but drifted outwards in upper stretch, straightened
course in the seven path and bid for the lead inside of the furlong pole while hanging on her left lead, and prevailed in the late stages. SUNSHINE BAY
established a clear lead early on and stayed in the three path, came into the lane in the four path, met a challenge from TRINKET inside the furlong marker,
and was bested by that foe in the late stages. ALILBIT SHADY trailed through the turn, swung to the eight path to be outside of rivals turning for home, and
offered a mild kick for minor rewards. PAZ THE WINE was void of early speed two wide, came into the lane between horses in the five path, but failed to
threaten. CHARLIE DREAMS RVF raced two wide in midpack while being kept in the four path, but lacked a rally while hanging on her left lead through the
lane, and weakened. YOUARESTILLTHEWON saved ground in midpack, but failed to keep pace passing the five sixteenths pole, and subsequently faded.
