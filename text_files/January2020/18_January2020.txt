Footnotes
SHEZA KATHY broke out and bumped at the start, dueled from the inside, drifted out into the stretch, battled with the runner-up through the lane and held
gamely. SPECTACULAR STORM pressed the issue from the outside, drifted out into the lane, fought gamely to the wire but was denied by the winner. I B
BUZZIN raced outside a rival up the backstretch, two wide into the turn then moved out four wide, came in near the sixteenth pole and earned the show.
LOUDER CALIFORNIA bumped leaving the gate, settled early along the inside, came three wide into the stretch, forced in by outside rival near the
sixteenth marker and was edged for third. CUTE TALKER broke out and got pinballed leaving the gate, unhurried up the backstretch, traveled two wide then
three wide leaving the turn and never threatened.
