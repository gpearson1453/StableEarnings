Footnotes
JETOVATOR came out a bit when between horses early then angled in and steadied off heels five eighths out, stalked inside, bid along the rail in the
stretch to gain a short lead past the eighth pole and gamely prevailed under urging. R MATINEIGH IDOL angled in and pressed the pace inside then dueled
along the rail, took the lead into the turn, came off the fence into the stretch, fought back between horses in the drive and continued willingly to the end. A
MAN'S MAN steadied sharply when crowded along the rail five eighths out, saved ground, came out on the turn and four wide into the stretch and edged a
rival late for third. TRENDING HIGHER angled in and prompted the pace three deep, fought back three wide in the stretch and was edged late for the show.
WATCH THE DIP came in a bit when between horses just after the start, stalked outside a rival, came three deep into the stretch, drifted in late and lacked
the needed rally. FELLOW CITIZEN angled in and dueled between horses, fell back some in the stretch, drifted in late and weakened. SIBERIAN TIGAH
clipped heels and steadied in tight just after the start, chased outside a rival, dropped back and drifted out on the turn and had little left for the stretch.
Following a stewards' inquiry, R MATINEIGH IDOL was disqualified and placed third for interference early on the backstretch.

Footnotes
BUSY PAYNTER had good early speed and set a pressured pace inside, kicked clear on the turn, remained clear under urging in the stretch then held
under steady handling late. MONGOLIAN HUMOR a bit slow to begin, dropped back off the rail, came three wide into the stretch and finished well. RIZZI'S
HONORS stalked outside a rival, continued outside on the turn and three deep into the stretch and bested the others. NO WINE UNTASTED prompted the
pace three deep, stalked outside a rival on the turn, angled in a bit off the fence into the stretch and weakened. RATTLE broke a bit slowly, saved ground
chasing the pace, came out into the stretch and lacked a further response. EDNA pressed the pace between horses then stalked a bit off the rail on the turn,
drifted inward in the stretch and weakened.
