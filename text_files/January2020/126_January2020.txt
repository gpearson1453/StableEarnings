Footnotes
SEDAMAR saved ground stalking the pace, bid along the rail under urging past the eighth pole to gain the lead in deep stretch and gamely prevailed. SOLD
IT took the early lead and angled in, set the pace inside, came off the rail into the stretch, battled outside the winner past midstretch, fought back in deep
stretch and was outfinished. LOVE AND PEACE (FR) took back and angled in early, stalked outside a rival, came three deep into the stretch and gained the
show. K P SLICKEM a bit slow to begin, came out and chased outside a rival, came out into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. WICKED OLD
FASHION angled in and saved ground chasing the pace, came out into the stretch and lacked the necessary response between foes late. CHICKATINI
pulled her way along to stalk the pace outside a rival, was between horses in upper stretch, drifted in through the final furlong and did not rally.

Footnotes
SABINOS PRIDE had speed inside to duel for the lead then inched away leaving the first turn, set all the pace along the inside, kicked away on the second
turn and drew off in the stretch under left handed urging and a hold late. K P CATS WILD broke out a bit, dueled between horses into the first turn then
stalked off the rail, came out some into the stretch and held second. SUBTLE RIDE chased inside, came out leaving the second turn, split horses into the
stretch and bested the others. VANNAVANNA BO BANA settled just off the inside chasing the pace, angled to the inside on the second turn, continued
along the rail in the stretch and weakened. CIRCLEOFCOLOR dropped back a bit off the fence in the early going, angled to the inside entering the stretch
and had little left for the drive. KEEPINMYPROMISE had speed three deep to prompt the pace then stalked outside the runner-up, came three wide into the
stretch, gave way and drifted out while being eased through the final furlong and walked off.

Footnotes
GRINNINGEARTOEAR stalked three deep then outside a rival on the turn, came three wide into the stretch, lugged in a bit past the eighth pole, was four
wide under some urging a sixteenth out, surged to the front in deep stretch and proved best. SQUARE PEGGY sped to the early lead, dueled inside, inched
away on the turn, came a bit off the rail in midstretch, drifted in slightly in the late stages, was bumped nearing the wire and held second. VIOLETTE SZABO
stalked between horses then inside on the turn, came out in upper stretch, was between foes through the final furlong and held third. SUNRISE ROYALE
had good early speed and dueled outside the runner-up, stalked a bit off the rail on the turn, also continued between horses through the final furlong and
was edged for the show. SMILING ANNIE saved ground stalking the pace, was in a bit tight into the turn to fall back some, continued inside, tried to go
through tight quarters along the fence in deep stretch, bumped with the runner-up and steadied late. CHRISTY JACKSON chased inside then outside a rival
on the turn, continued off the inside in the stretch and was outkicked. STORMIN RANGER hopped in a slow start, settled off the rail then a bit off the fence
into and on the turn and into the stretch and lacked a rally. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the bumping in late stretch between the second and fifth
finishers, but made no change when they ruled SMILING ANNIE initiated the contact.

Footnotes
GO BIG BLUE NATION stalked three deep, went up four wide on the second turn then bid three wide to gain the lead a quarter mile out, kicked clear under
some urging in the stretch, drifted in and held. GOING TO VEGAS broke in a bit, stalked inside, came out around a rival leaving the second turn and three
deep into the stretch and edged a rival for the place. LUCIA'S DESIGN stalked inside then between horses on the backstretch, split rivals on the second
turn and again in midstretch and was edged for second. I GIVE UP steadied when squeezed between foes in the opening strides, angled in and chased
inside, came out for room on he second turn and four wide into the stretch and could not quite summon the needed late kick. DIPPING IN tugged between
horses then stalked outside a rival, split horses three deep leaving the backstretch and into the second turn, bid between rivals a quarter mile out, drifted in
and weakened some in the final furlong. HONEYWHISKEYNWINE stalked outside a rival then bid alongside the pacesetter leaving the backstretch, took the
lead and inched away and angled in on the second turn, dueled inside leaving that turn and into the stretch and also weakened in the final furlong. FIRST
EMPRESS squeezed a bit at the start and in a bit tight early, chased between foes, continued a bit off the rail on the second turn and outside a rival into the
stretch and lacked a further response. ZIPPNINTHECITY had speed three deep then edged away and angled in, set the pace inside, dueled along the rail
on the backstretch and into the second turn, dropped back leaving that turn and had little left for the stretch.

Footnotes
MOTHER MOTHER stalked outside a rival, came out some in the stretch, bid outside the runner-up past the eighth pole, gained the advantage a sixteenth
out and edged away under a strong hand ride and steady handling late. LADY NINJA had speed three deep then dueled outside a rival, inched away in the
stretch, fought back inside the winner in the final furlong, could not quite match that one late but clearly bested the others. SHOW IT N MOE IT between
horses early, dueled a bit off the rail then inside on the turn and into the stretch, came off the inside in deep stretch and held third. FLOR DE LA MAR saved
ground stalking the pace, came out in the stretch and was edged for the show. EXUBERANCE stalked the pace inside on the backstretch and turn, came
out into the stretch and weakened.

turn, drifted out into the stretch and in upper stretch, kicked clear while drifting in from the whip in the drive and held sway under a hold late. ROCKS AND

edged a rival for the show. CANYON CREST crossed inward and settled inside then outside a rival leaving the backstretch, went three deep leaving the
second turn and five wide into the stretch and was edged for third. GAMBINI broke out a bit, angled in and settled off the pace inside, came out on the
second turn and three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. FANTASY GAME had speed three deep then dueled outside the winner, stalked
outside a rival or just off the rail on the backstretch and second turn, continued alongside a foe in midstretch and weakened. PERFECT AFFECTION angled
