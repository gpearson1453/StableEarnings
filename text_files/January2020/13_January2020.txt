Footnotes
TRIP CANDY unhurried in the early part, raced wide around both turns, took command around the final turn, was going away and won under steady urging.
OVERLYAPPEALING lacked early speed, moved up six wide around the final turn, made a wide gain, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear
second. DYNA GHOST raced in the back of the field in the early going, made a late gain and was just up for the show. PROPER CROSS pressed the pace,
steadied around the second turn to avoid rival being pulled up, rallied down the home stretch and weakened late. I'LL RAISE YOU bobbled at the start,
quickly moved up to the middle of the pack, challenged for the lead before fading. SANCTITY dueled for the early lead and was finished early. A. P.'S
PRINCE always raced in the back and was eased to the wire, walked off. COSTA ALOT pressed the early pace, checked around the second turn, blocked,
lacked running room while racing on the rail, took up and was eased to the wire, walked off. WRISTLET challenged for the early lead, saved ground, pulled
up around the second turn and was vanned off.

ground around the turn and dropped back. DIGNITYTO INFINITY broke slow and was never close.

Footnotes
CAVALLOTTO went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and finished well. THAT'S D 'CAT reserved, within contention, while saving ground, drifted in
down the home stretch and was a clear second at the wire. SWEEPING EDGE unhurried in the early going, racing inside around the final turn, checked
down the home stretch, getting in tight on the rail and was clearly third. MACANDALES pressed the early pace and weakened late. JUBAL raced within
striking distance, came around the final turn on the outside and was finished early. HOLIDAY MAN pressed the early pace, faded and finished evenly near
the back. WHISKEY SEVEN always raced in the back and showed little. THE JOCKEY OF #5 SWEEPING EDGE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST
#1 THAT'S D'CAT FOR INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
SINGINGINTHEWIND unhurried in the early going, moved up around the final turn, angled out entering the final stretch, split rivals and got up in time.
HONOR MY SPEED was an early factor, forwardly placed throughout, took the lead down the home stretch, dueling with XIROMA, put him away, but was
caught by SINGINGINTHEWIND. XIROMA raced within striking distance, angled out leaving the second turn, dueled down the lane with HONOR MY
SPEED while drifting out and proved third best at the wire. U COMPLETE ME raced within contention, put forth an even effort and was no real threat.
ATOMIC CANDY went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and faded. HARD STORY lacked early speed, improved position, but was no threat. HAPPY
JOURNEY raced near the back and lacked a bid. MARCO'S TRIBUTE pressed the early pace and made a steady retreat. SHOESFROMTHEGITGO void of
early speed, raced four wide around the first turn and was never close. DEWEYCHEATEMANHOWE raced in the middle of the field and stopped.
