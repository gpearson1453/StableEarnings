MOLAF dueled inside to the turn, drew away for a clear lead and held safely under steady urging. INQUISITEUR was fractious in the paddock, dueled two
across to the turn, fell back and was all out for place. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT was slow early, raced inside, angled out for the drive, found his best stride late
and was gaining for second. PAUL'S DIVA lagged while racing outside, bid eight wide and narrowed the gap. TOP HAT HUSTLE raced evenly under mild
urging and did not threaten. ITS ALL ON SLEW was not urged and outrun. MYSTERIOUS JOURNEY broke slowly and trailed the field.

BURNADEBT saved ground , closed along the rail under steady left handed urging, got up near the sixteenth pole and drew off. MOMENTARIANISM
contended early, assumed command into the turn, drew clear, faltered near the sixteenth pole and finished second best. STACKED was taken outside,
showed speed to the turn, flattened out and finished best of the rest. SEA OF GALILEE failed to contend and showed little. SPRING THE TRAPPE dwelt,

Footnotes
TIRUNESH broke awkwardly, was in tight entering the first turn, stalked inside, got through along the rail on the second turn, dueled through the stretch and
proved best. ZELAIA was sent to the front, set a pressured pace to the second turn, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished in a game effort.
WILLING TO BURN raced close to the pace outside, was roused on the turn, bid willingly to threaten, hung late and settled for show. MY MIA MYAH stalked
the pace while racing between horses, fell back on the turn and lacked the needed late rally. OWEN'S SHOT was unhurried early, went seven wide at the
top of the stretch, closed well and didn't have enough left. COSQUILLAS pressed the pace to the second turn, tired, stopped and was not urged late. EASY
DOES IT was not urged and failed to contend. SECRET ALIBI was through early, stopped and not urged late.

Footnotes
YES PLEASE stalked inside, shifted out and rallied into the turn, assumed command, drew off for a long lead and just lasted under steady urging. ATHENA
THE GODDESS raced mid pack, was checked on the second turn, bid inside and was gaining fast late. S U M RACER was unhurried early, bid four wide
entering the stretch, closed steadily and earned show. MISS SHAWHAN was checked on the second turn, angled in in the upper stretch and offered a mild
bid only. BONITA ANNIE was void of early speed, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid. TRAPPIZA stalked the pace to the second turn,
swung wide, gave way and was not urged late. BELLA'S BACK set the pace to the second turn, tired and stopped. SLINGSHOT MISTRESS was through
after a half, stopped and distanced the field. The riders' of ATHENA THE GODDESS and MISS SHAWHAN lodged objections concerning possible
interference on the second turn. No change was made.
