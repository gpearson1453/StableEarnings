WOUND TIGHT sped to the early lead and angled in, set the pace inside, responded when challenged on the backstretch, inched away again on the second
turn, kicked clear under urging in the stretch and proved best. WARD 'N JERRY pulled along the inside and steadied in the stretch the first time, saved
ground stalking the pace then went between foes leaving the backstretch and on the second turn and into the stretch, came out some in the drive and
edged a rival late for the place. CONO pulled inside rivals then outside a foe in the first stretch, stalked a bit off the rail, bid outside the winner leaving the
backstretch and into the second turn, continued just off the inside on that turn and into the stretch and was edged late for second. ASHLEYLUVSSUGAR
stalked three deep then outside a rival, went three wide into and out of the second turn and was outfinished. THE HUNTED squeezed back at the start,
stalked between horses then outside leaving the second turn and three wide into the stretch and also was outkicked in the final furlong. DESMOND DOSS
settled off the rail, came out some in the stretch and had a mild late bid. ACCOUNTABILITY between horses early, angled in and saved ground stalking the
pace, continued inside in the stretch and lacked the necessary response. MOBOU stalked three deep, came four wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
FAST ENOUGH angled in off the rail then went up four wide on the backstretch and second turn and into the stretch, bid four wide under urging in
midstretch, drifted in and battled outside the winner and gamely prevailed late. SACRED RIDER stalked three deep to the stretch, bid three wide between
horses to gain a short lead in midstretch, also drifted in and fought back inside the winner to the wire. BETTOR TRIP NICK sent to the early lead, set the
pace inside, kicked away from rivals again on the backstretch, fought back inside in the stretch and held third. DAPPER stalked a bit off the rail, bid between
horses five eighths out, tracked the leader again just off the rail, fell back between foes on the second turn and weakened. CLUB ASPEN was in a good
position stalking the pace between horses, came three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. SUMMER FIRE four wide on the first turn and into
the backstretch, bid three deep five eighths out then tracked again, re-bid alongside the pacesetter on the second turn and between horses into the stretch
and in midstretch and weakened in the final furlong. INDIAN PEAK angled in and saved ground chasing the pace, steadied in a bit tight along the rail into
the stretch and lacked the needed rally. ROOKIE MISTAKE four wide into the first turn, angled in and chased outside a rival then a bit off the rail, came
three wide into the stretch and did not rally. BIG RETURNS settled off the rail then outside on the backstretch, dropped back and angled in on the second
turn and weakened.

Footnotes
WARREN'S SHOWTIME between horses early, angled in and stalked inside, bid along the fence under urging past the eighth pole to gain the lead and won
clear. BULLETPROOF ONE pulled to the early lead, set the pace a bit off the rail then dueled inside, inched away again on the second turn, came a bit off
the fence in the stretch and just held second. WARRIOR'S MOON four wide early, angled in just off the inside then stalked along the rail, came out into the
stretch and was edged for second between foes on the line. CALIFORNIA KOOK broke a bit slowly, chased three deep then outside a rival, came three
wide into the stretch, split horses in midstretch and was edged for third between foes late. SMILING SHIRLEE angled in and chased outside a rival then
between horses on the second turn and into the stretch, found the inside in the drive and was outfinished for a minor award. HOMEHOME chased outside a
rival then a bit off the rail, came out on the second turn and five wide into the stretch and could not quite summon the necessary late kick. WISE RACHEL
saved ground off the pace, came out on the second turn and four wide into the stretch and also could not quite offer the needed response. ALMOST A
FACTOR saved ground stalking the pace, steadied in tight a bit off the rail into the second turn, continued inside and lacked the needed rally. CHOLULA
LIPS pulled and stalked outside, bid three deep on the backstretch, tracked the leader outside on the second turn and four wide into the stretch and
weakened. MIDNIGHT SUNRISE stalked off the rail then bid between horses on the backstretch and outside the pacesetter into the second turn, came out
three deep into the stretch and also weakened. BEEN STUDYING HER broke a bit slowly, dropped back just off the rail then inside and did not rally.
