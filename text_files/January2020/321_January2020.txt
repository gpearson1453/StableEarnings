Footnotes
THE GODDESS LYSSA exchanged some brushes with JUDY'S WAY in the opening sixteenth, shifted off the inside while being urged to the lead, dictated
the pace on a narrow margin racing into the turn, shook clear while angling to the three path nearing upper stretch and held sway on a safe margin to the
end under energetic handling. BRIDGE DANCER tracked just off the leaders between foes racing to the bend, gained position between foes to bid inside
the pacesetter in upper stretch and proved best of the others. SOLID AS A ROCK, in touch prompting a rival's pace racing to the turn, proved no match for
that foe leaving the midway point of the turn but continued with interest late to edge a rival for a share. JUDY'S WAY exchanged some brushes just after the
start, tracked the leaders inside foes, saved ground on the turn while being prompted to advance in tandem with a rival to upper stretch but had no late kick.
REAL DOOZIE tracked the leaders outside foes and faded early.

Footnotes
TINY DANZA, forwardly placed outside rivals from the outset, maintained striking position tracking just off the leaders to the turn, came under prompting
midway through the bend to press the issue outside a rival into upper stretch, wrested the advantage and went clear under firm right handed
encouragement. JAMFLOWMAN was rated off the first flight while angling inside in the opening stages, switched out leaving the midway point of the turn
while being prompted to advance, continued in pursuit of the winner to late stages but proved only second best. CPL. DIONICIO attended the pace between
rivals in the opening stages, pressed the issue through the turn to strike the front between calls, dueled inside the winner into upper stretch but proved no
match for the top pair late. HAY HAY MY MY tracked off the first flight racing four wide into the turn and faded in that path racing into upper stretch. BUMPA
hopped at the start, was urged to gain a narrow advantage while angling inwards, dueled for command inside a rival through the turn and gave way nearing
upper stretch. THREE OLIVEZ broke slowly and was always outrun.

Footnotes
MY COWBOY sprinted clear of the field just off the rail racing to the backstretch while under light rating, dictated the pace to the second bend, then held
sway through the stretch to widen his advantage in the closing stages under firm left handed encouragement. FIERY OPAL tracked the pacesetter from well
out of striking distance three deep as part of the second flight in the opening half, then improved position between foes in that path into the stretch to
narrowly prevail for the place honors nearing the wire. INDIAN GULCH tracked the pacesetter from out of striking distance between foes leading the second
flight on a narrow margin for five furlongs, advanced to lodged a brief bid nearing upper stretch but flattened out through the final furlong. THANK YOU was
settled along the inside in the opening half, swung out five wide nearing upper stretch and made some belated progress. SPRING UP tracked off the second
flight outside a rival to the far turn, shifted out while being prompted to advance four wide racing into upper stretch but had no final kick. GLOBAL HERO
angled to the rail tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight racing to the far turn and steadily faded into the stretch.

UNCOMMON FACTOR was urged inside a rival to dispute the pace through the backstretch, then into the turn, shook clear racing into upper stretch and
was kept to firm hand urging and a few right handed taps to widen the margin to the end. CAPTAIN ANGEL hopped at the start, angled inwards pressing the
pace outside the eventual winner through the backstretch, then into the turn, couldn't match that foe in upper stretch but continued with interest to prove
best of the others. GRANDMARY tracked just off the leaders along the inside in the opening stages, lost ground to those foes on the turn, shifted out racing
through the stretch to race four wide in the final stages but continued under stout pressure to edge a rival for a share. OLGA AGAIN was rated off the
second flight while angling inside in the opening stages, saved ground to upper stretch while being prompted to advance, lacked the needed final kick and
was taken in hand nearing the wire. DATING, urged along four wide racing into the turn to maintain a position off the second flight, failed to gain contention.
J'S THREESTEP HALO tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the turn and proved no real threat. COCOA KEELY angled inwards to track off
the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn and gave way after a half.

Footnotes
HIDE THE DEMON was urged to terms with a rival along the inside prompting the pace in the opening stages, gained a narrow advantage between calls
leaving the gap, dueled for command racing into the turn while being headed midway through the bend, continued to press the issue to regain the
advantage racing into upper stretch, then was roused clear through the stretch, widening late under firm left handed pressure and strong handling.
TWOCUBANBROTHERSU, held up avoiding close quarters racing through the chute, was guided outside the field while being prompted to terms with the
first flight racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue three deep to the turn, lost some ground to the leaders while being fanned four wide racing into
upper stretch but produced a second effort in the closing stages to edge a rival for the place honors. LUDINGTON, prominent between foes from the break,
conceded the lead leaving the chute to track off the first flight racing to the turn, shifted out three deep nearing upper stretch while being urged to advance
between foes but lacked the needed final kick while losing second late. PUDDING broke inwards bumping D'CRAZINESS lightly, angled inwards to gain
terms with the pacesetter racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes racing into the turn to gain a brief advantage but gave way
nearing midstretch. DIVINE AMBITION tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening stages, was prompted to advance while shifting out four wide
racing through the turn and faded into the stretch. D'CRAZINESS, bumped at the start, then steadied out of close quarters in the opening stages, angled to
the inside on the backstretch tracking off the second flight but lacked a rally.

KEEPSAKEKITTEN was rated along the rail in the opening stages racing just off the second flight into the backstretch, saved ground awaiting an opening
on the far turn, bid for command along the rail in upper stretch to gain a narrow advantage and just held PRETENDANT under firm right handed pressure to
narrowly prevail. The latter stalked just off the pacesetter racing a bit off the rail into the backstretch, was prompted to challenge for command between
rivals nearing upper stretch, contested the issue in a prolonged drive past midstretch and was just outkicked. RECKLESS SPIRIT angled to the inside
dropping off the second flight racing to the first turn, steadied nearing the backstretch, continued inside foes into the far turn, swung out five wide racing into
upper stretch and finished willingly to gain terms with the top pair nearing the wire while just outkicked. CATCH YA LATER BRO broke inwards bumping
HE'S SMOKIN NOW, was quickly righted, then sped to the lead while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the far
turn, was roused to resist several challengers shifting off the inside racing into upper stretch, resisted the top pair past midstretch but yielded nearing the
wire. HE'S SMOKIN NOW, bumped at the start, was reserved between foes while angling inwards racing to the backstretch, shifted to the rail on the far turn
and continued to improve position. CLASSIFIED INFO tracked the pacesetter three deep as part of the second flight in the opening half, was prompted to
advance in that path nearing upper stretch bidding for command, was fanned four wide racing into the lane and soon gave way. TRAVELIN' SONG, caught
four wide racing into the first turn, angled inwards to track outside a rival off the second flight through the backstretch but never gained contention. ROSAS
WAY, off a step slowly, was steadied out of tight quarters while three deep between foes racing into the first turn and never menaced thereafter.

CHOLLA, pulling a bit along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, awaited an opening racing into upper stretch, shifted off the
inside to bid for command between foes leaving midstretch and prevailed in time under firm handling. ALYDARIUS tracked off the second flight along the
inside racing to the backstretch, angled off the inside nearing upper stretch, shifted out four wide racing past the furlong marker and continued willingly while
shifting inwards to challenge for command while proving only second best. MY MASTERPIECE broke out bumping at the start, was righted, then moved to
gain the lead while angling to the rail racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, maintained that advantage past midstretch
but was collared by the top pair late. SWEET MOOCHIE settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the first turn, was carried out a bit entering the
backstretch, angled to the rail after a half, saved ground to upper stretch and found her best stride in the closing stages to close the gap inside foes nearing
the wire. LEGACY PARK, held up avoiding the pacesetter in the opening stages, shifted outside that rival while prompted to a forward placing stalking the
pace into the backstretch, continued under patient handling to the far turn, was urged to challenge racing into upper stretch but came up empty in the final
stages. UNABRIDGED (IRE), bumped at the start, worked her way to the inside tracking well off the second flight, shifted out nearing upper stretch, angled
out five wide racing through the stretch and continued with a mild bid. DREAM ON JILLY tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the far turn and
faded into the stretch. AURIGA angled inwards to track off the second flight three deep, continued in that path into the far turn and steadily faded.
ANONYMOUS, caught four wide racing into the first turn, was prompted to make brief progress outside foes racing through the backstretch but quickly came
empty entering the far turn. NO SNIVELING, off a step slowly, was pulling a bit in the last flight along the inside, switched out racing into the backstretch
crossing over the path of SWEET MOOCHIE and quickly dropped out.

Footnotes
COMMANDER OF DEATH was urged to dispute the pace inside a rival racing through the backstretch, continued in a long drive to upper stretch, shifted out
bumping COUNTESS JESSICA near midstretch, continued under left handed pressure ducking out bumping that rival soundly nearing the sixteenth marker,
then edged forward under right handed pressure to prove best. COUNTESS JESSICA was urged to terms prompting the pacesetter through the backstretch
into the turn, pressed the issue in a protracted skirmish to upper stretch, was bumped near midstretch, then was knocked off stride when bumped again
approaching the sixteenth marker and yielded to the winner while prevailing for second. TALK NICE was rated tracking just off the first flight in the opening
stages, continued outside a rival tracking the leaders into the turn, shifted out three deep while being urged to advance on the top pair but finished evenly in
the closing stages while prevailing for a share. GONEASAGIRLCANGET tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the turn, angled out racing
into upper stretch and continued with interest to improve position between foes while just missing for a share. FERLAND'S PROSPECT tracked off the
second flight outside a rival racing to the turn, was fanned four wide racing into upper stretch but had no closing bid. BORN TO GROOVE angled to the
inside tracking off the first flight racing into the turn and faded into the stretch. LA CAFETERA was soon outdistanced but walked off under her own power.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN WHILE THE RIDER OF COUNTESS JESSICA
LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF COMMANDER OF DEATH. AFTER REVIEWING THE INCIDENT THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED COMMANDER OF DEATH FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HER SECOND.

Footnotes
VINTNER, held up three deep between foes avoiding close quarters tracking off the first flight into the backstretch, shifted out four wide after a half, was
prompted to make a steady advance in that path through the far turn to upper stretch and wrested the advantage in the closing stages under firm left handed
encouragement. OLD FORT, caught five wide between foes while under firm restraint avoiding tight quarters racing into the first turn, was reserved off the
second flight entering the backstretch while angling inwards, was prompted to advance splitting rivals just off the inside nearing upper stretch and continued
willingly inside the winner to late stages while just failing to match strides with that foe late. PURRS AGAIN sped to the lead while angling to the rail racing to
the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the far turn, edged forward to a clear advantage racing into upper stretch but yielded to the top pair
late. DRILL BIT, caught six wide while being taken in hand avoiding traffic racing to the first turn, angled to the inside nearing the backstretch, was prompted
to gain position shifting out splitting foes racing into the far turn, lodged a bid three deep between foes nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final
kick. HUSBAND IN LAW angled inwards while moving to terms with a rival prompting the pace, pressed the issue to the far turn and gave way. HAIL MARY
PASS came through close quarters along the inside while being rated just off the leaders into the backstretch, was prompted to make some progress inside
foes on the far turn but came up empty in the drive. DRILL DOWN tracked off the first flight racing three, then four wide to the backstretch and emptied out
early. SCHILLER NAV, pulling hard while very rank between foes racing just off the leaders into the backstretch, shifted out to race three deep between foes
in the second quarter but gave way after a half. ALPERES, caught five wide between foes racing to the first turn, then outside foes to the backstretch,
retreated early.
