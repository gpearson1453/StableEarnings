Footnotes
BELLARMINE HALL pulled his way to the front and set a rated pace outside of MARKET MOVER, dueled with that one while still under rating past the three
eighths, lost the lead past the quarter pole, kept up the battle under left handed rousing, regained command with about a sixteenth remaining and held firm.
BARRISTER , outside foes while chasing the pace, circled four wide under a drive into the lane and brushed with PAINT MUSIC FOR ME, ranged up past
the sixteenth marker to take aim on the dueling leaders, kept grinding from there but had his rally fall just short. MARKET MOVER prompted the pace to the
inside of BELLARMINE HALL, drew on near even terms mid turn, sparred and gained a slim lead inside the quarter pole, continued the fight to deep stretch
then gave way grudgingly. PAINT MUSIC FOR ME bobbled soon after the break, recovered and raced in range off the inside, was under pressure between
foes past the three eighths, shifted out for the drive brushing with a rival, chased and came up empty. SECURITY BREACH rated early and edged up a bit
between foes past the five eighths, saved ground trailing into the stretch, swung out in the drive but lacked a solid run. ROOF TOP BAR saved ground
chasing the dueling leaders and faded.

EASY RIVER saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch, found ample room inside the pace setting UNBRIDLED OUTLAW
to challenge for the lead inside the sixteenth pole and narrowly prevailed. RUNABOUT , four deep around the turn, rallied outside horses. UNBRIDLED
OUTLAW set the pace while kept off the rail, raced in the two path through the stretch and weakened late. MY EMINENCE lacked speed, swung to the five
path in upper stretch and had a mild rally. MINERS QUEST chased the pace three wide and weakened. LASER LOOP saved ground on the turn and was
not a factor. BIRDIES HONOR , four wide leaving the backstretch, raced in the two path on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
THREE HAWK rated four wide and in range, took closer order past the five sixteenths, responded to left handed rousing and drew alongside BREAK
CURFEW nearing the furlong grounds, wrested a short lead soon after, dueled under solid hand encouragement through the final sixteenth and proved
resolute. BREAK CURFEW quickly went clear and angled in to secure the rail, set a rated pace, handled outside pressure leaving the three eighths marker,
shook back clear after being set down in upper stretch, dug in when collared by the winner in mid stretch and kept on gamely to the line. REFLECT , forced
in some at the break, regrouped and moved up between foes to stalk the pace, had aim towards the inside in upper stretch, eased out in the final furlong
and closed steadily. YOU MADE IT , three wide in close attendance, bid to apply pressure leaving the far turn, could not keep pace with the leader leaving
the three sixteenths, stayed willingly to the eighth pole then gave way. NOT LEAVING bobbled inward at the break, was righted to be close up past the five
eighths, eased back off the leaders heading to the half mile pole, failed to kick on leaving the three eighths and faded. GOTAHEADACHE , wide, was ridden
along mid turn and failed to respond. ROCKSTAR GIRL was pushed inward at the start, straightened and advanced inside foes, steadied when in close
near the five eighths, shuffled back heading towards the turn then failed to recover.

MIA GIFT bobbled slightly at the break, prompted the pace outside RISAALAAT, overtook that one leaving the turn, opened up in mid stretch and was kept
to her business in the drive. JUMPING MICHELLE , bumped by LIZ'S SMILE leaving the starting gate, raced outside horses, circled the turn four wide and
rallied mildly. LIZ'S SMILE bumped JUMPING MICHELLE when coming in at the break, stalked the pace two wide around the turn, angled in approaching
the eighth pole and gained inside the winner. PEARL GEM prompted the pace three wide and gave way entering the stretch. RISAALAAT hugged the inner
rail, set a pressured pace and gave way. SIPPING CHAMPAGNE saved ground on the turn and trailed.

GOTHAM NEWS , patiently handled early on, edged up between foes to be close nearing the turn, dropped in around the turn and tracked, cut the corner
into the lane and bid inside the leaders, gained a slim lead with a furlong to go, kicked clear under a drive near the sixteenth marker then held firm under
steady handling. TWIN VALOR , with the pace and to the inside of ALGORIX, moved to command with about five furlongs remaining, rated along while
handling some pressure, spurted clear into the lane while guided off the inside, wandered outward and bumped soundly with HOMEOFTHE LOMBARDI in
mid stretch, straightened and kept on gamely. HOMEOFTHE LOMBARDI rated off the rail, moved up between foes mid turn, angled and rallied five wide
into the stretch, drew alongside TWIN VALOR near the three sixteenths, dueled then bumped with that one leaving the furlong grounds and faded. GREEK
GOD lost ground four wide, stalked past the half mile marker, was under pressure while still wide into the lane, saw the leaders get away past the quarter
pole but kept trying to the line. STOLEN LOVE chased three wide between rivals and gave way grudgingly. QUIT YOUR MOANIN , unhurried early, angled
very wide while making a run into the stretch, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and gave way. ALGORIX bobbled at the break, gained command
early and disputed the pace outside TWIN VALOR, stayed on to the five sixteenths then surrendered. FLOYD UNGER , towards the inside pursuing the
leaders, faltered off the rail nearing the lane. FLASHY BARON , rank and off slow, ducked in soon after, lost contact withe field, was eased in the lane then
walked off.

CASTLE RIDGE prompted the pace outside INTRACTABLE, secured command mid way on the turn and steadily pulled away under confident handling.
CASE DISMISSED lacked speed, raced two wide on the turn, remained in the two path in the stretch, was inside horses and passed tired ones. LADY KIM ,
three wide on the turn, chased the winner and faded in the drive. MY CHESA CHARM chased the pace two wide on the turn, angled to the four path
entering the stretch and gave way. COCKTAIL WAITRESS , in hand behind a rival along the rail on the turn, swung to the four path approaching the stretch
and gave way. INTRACTABLE , angled in mid way down the backstretch, hugged the inner rail setting a pressured pace and faltered through the stretch.

Footnotes
OUTSIDE THE BOX broke a step slow, steadied soon after, moved up while saving ground past the three sixteenths, angled out inside the eighth pole,
closed sharply, forged past the leader with about forty yards remaining and drew out in eager and handy fashion. CHUCK'S DREAM dueled outside a rival
to mid stretch, edged clear heading to the sixteenth marker, kept on willingly but could not withstand the winner's charge. WHITE RUSSIAN came in at the
break, corrected and took command early, dueled along the inside with CHUCK'S DREAM, continued to battle past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly.
STRAITOUTA CONGTIN , bumped at the break, saved ground while moving up a bit mid turn, angled four wide for the drive but flattened out. TOM
TERRIFIC , reluctant to load, hopped at the break and was away slowly, raced well back into the turn, came three to four wide for the drive, angled out in
mid stretch and offered a late bid. PERFECT HEIR , off the pace four wide, shifted seven wide for the drive but lacked a solid kick. FATHER'S LUCK ,
bumped at the break, pursued four wide mid turn, was floated out some near mid stretch and gave way. DUSKY rated close up two wide behind the duel,
failed to kick on in upper stretch and weakened. TRUE SHIPMAN , wide chasing the duel, dropped back in upper stretch. SPIRITUS broke slowly, was
outrun and then eased late.
