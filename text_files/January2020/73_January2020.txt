Footnotes
LITTLE SONG was rated in the three path outside the early leader, moved to the front entering the far turn, drew out soon after and was kept to a drive.
FALCON'S VIEW was unhurried early, came out two wide between rivals while advancing on the final turn, moved closer outside the winner into the final
furlong, bore out under left hand whip but couldn't gain. ECHO BAY lagged early, began a run in the two path into the far turn, came out into the four path
for room nearing the stretch then gained mildly to the end. NEARLY MISSED wasn't far back in the three path around the first turn, faded outside on the
backstretch, raced wide around the final turn and outlasted tired ones. MOON CHANT improved position between rivals on the backstretch, moved closer
three wide before six furlongs then had nothing left for the drive. BESS was hustled to the front at once, stayed out from the rail while making the pace to the
end of the backstretch, stopped after three-quarters and was eased up through the lane.

Footnotes
HARPY EAGLE settled in midpack and raced in hand behind the leading group into the far turn, tipped to the four path between horses approaching the
quarter pole, commenced a rally passing the furlong marker, rallied late, and drove past the leader at the wire. SLY WILDCAT stalked three wide, bid for the
lead outside of the two duelers into the far turn, took command passing the five sixteenths pole, drew off while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, but
tired late and was caught at the wire. JOHNNY JUNIOR was void of speed two wide early on, gained ground outside of rivals down the backstretch and
made a four wide bid for the lead approaching the five sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by the leader in upper stretch, then kept on for a minor share.
GOTTOASKCHARLIE trailed the field to the quarter pole, swung six wide turning for home, and passed tired rivals without threatening. OMENED BY was
unhurried along the inside, shifted to the five path and gained ground slightly into and around the far turn, but failed to make an impact through the lane.
KEEP GOING dueled along the inside of BEE KEEPER through the first turn, allowed that foe to establish a clear margin into the backstretch, continued to
vie along the rail into the far turn, but weakened approaching the five sixteenths pole. BEE KEEPER dueled outside of KEEP GOING through the first turn,
established a clear advantage into the backstretch, but weakened when other rivals made bids around the far turn, and stopped through the lane.

along the rail, made a run into contention before six furlongs then stopped. RING NECKED was outrun after a slow break. THE ACCUSER was finished
early. HERE COMES GARY didn't break sharply, was sent to a long lead into the first turn while bearing out, continued to widened under urging on the

Footnotes
MY TRAIN tracked from the two path while behind the leading trio around the turn, angled in after passing the early tiring leader turning for home, made a
bid for the lead along the rail passing the sixteenth pole, and drove past. CHEESE ON prompted the pace setters from the three path, inched forward to bid
for the lead approaching the quarter pole, reached the lead approaching the furlong marker, but got outfinished by an inner foe in the final stages while
finishing willingly. GOLD SHARK forced the pace two wide, forged a lead away from his inner foe passing the five sixteenths pole while being hounded by
CHEESE ON, dug in as that foe made a bid for the lead in upper stretch before being headed approaching the furlong marker, then gave way through the
final stages. MR. SKITTLES angled to the rail into the turn while trailing, shifted off the fence in upper stretch, then rallied mildly while hanging on his left
lead to close the gap on the leaders without threatening. SCRAP IRON PHIL lunged outwards and bumped a rival at the start causing him to be off poorly,
settled far off the pace in the three path while inside of a rival, angled to the four path turning for home, but lacked a rally through the lane. BLINDING raced
in midpack and stayed in the five path despite only being outside of a single foe into the turn, then failed to factor. POLISHED STEEL set the pace inside of
a pressing rival, came under a drive to keep pace into the far turn, but weakened passing the five-sixteenths pole and subsequently stopped through the
lane.

Footnotes
THE GREAT CASBY had a rank start and was caught four wide around the first turn while far off the pace, advanced down the backstretch to a striking
position into the far turn, made a three wide bid outside of the dueling leadesr at the five sixteenths pole, forged a lead in upper stretch, then drew off under
driving pressure through the final furlong. STADIUM was off a step slow and trailed the field around the first turn, advanced position passing the half mile
pole to be in range of the leaders while five wide into the far turn, but was put to a drive approaching the three furlong pole before getting outkicked by the
eventual winner at the five sixteenths marker, then kept on mildly through the lane even after the rider stopped urging approaching the sixteenth pole, and
just got up for place at the wire. VOUCH established a clear lead into the first turn, dueled for the lead as BOYD CROWDER pulled forward into the
backstretch, held position turning for home, but was headed by the eventual winner in upper stretch, then kept on, but was nailed on the wire for place.
TERRY'S CHARM trailed the field after being three wide around the first turn, angled to the five path into the far turn, then stayed on through the lane while
hanging on his left lead. WONDERFULLY TUNED saved ground from midpack, was put to a drive passing the seven sixteenths pole, then passed outer
tiring rivals through the final furlong. SOUPER FLY OVER tracked from the two path, but was outmoved by multiple foes into the far turn, came into the lane
three wide between horses, but lacked a rally and weakend. BOYD CROWDER prompted the pace two wide, pulled to duel for the lead into the backstretch,
sustained the duel into the far turn, but weakened passing the quarter pole and stopped.

DEPUTY ZAPPER broke slowly, lagged badly early, began a run into the turn, angled to the outside in early stretch, closed slowly and was up in time.
UNSUNG HERO advanced early between horses to duel, was bumped while four wide between foes into the turn, was bumped entering the stretch by FIRE
ANT, lugged in on that one soon after, moved to a short lead in deep stretch but was caught. A TO Z dueled two wide between horses, led into late stretch
then faltered. NONPLUSULTRA stayed along the rail while with the first flight throughout and weakened in the drive. MAKIN TROUBLE was prominent early
between horses, steadied when bumped into UNSUNG HERO entering the turn, remained wide into the stretch and tired. FIRE ANT bobbled then ducked in
sharply leaving the gate, recovered to make the early pace between horses, raced three wide around the turn, ran out into UNSUNG HERO entering the
stretch then was steadied when bumped and put in tight by that one then stopped. NO NO NOAH lugged in, bumped MAKIN TROUBLE while with the pace
into the turn, remained wide into the stretch and stopped.

Footnotes
IYWAAN settled in midpack before advancing position in the six path and outside of horses passing the half mild pole, glided up to the leaders to bid for the
lead in hand into the far turn, took over approaching the quarter pole, then drew off in upper stretch under driving pressure. DOWNHILL RACER saved
ground in midpack around the first turn, angled off the inside to the four path into the far turn, gained ground around that bend to bid for place at the quarter
pole, but was no match for the leader before staying on to prove second best. TEAM RIBOT stalked from the pocket into the far turn, but was shuffled back
behind the tiring I'SE DUBAI around the bend, steadied at the quarter pole, then found room turning for home and rerallied along the rail through the lane for
a minor reward. GIO LEMON was fractious in the gate while waiting for it to open stalked three wide while being caught in the five path around the first turn,
inched forward and angled down to the two path to bid for the lead in to the far turn, but was no match for the eventual winner passing the quarter pole, and
subsequently weakened. OFFLEE ALEX had a slow start and trailed the field to the far turn, swung to the six path at the quarter pole, and passed tired
horses through the lane. POKER CHIPS had a slow start and was kept in the four path without a rival to his inside around the first turn, then took the five
path through the far turn and failed to factor. BLAZE A TRAIL pressed the pace setter while being kept in the four path by that rival into the backstretch, but
failed to keep pace after angling to the two path into the far turn, and weakened between horses. I'SE DUBAI was keen while maintaining a lead into the
backstretch, met challengers into the far turn, but weakened along the inside without being asked or urged from the rider passing the five sixteenths pole,
and was eased through the lane. RAFTER was two wide in midpack, but weakened around the far turn and was eased through the lane. STUN had an
awkward start and was kept in the four path without a rival to his inside, then failed to get involved and was eased through the lane.
