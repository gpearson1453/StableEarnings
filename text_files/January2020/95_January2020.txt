Footnotes
CITIBIKE showed good early speed from the outside, dug in game deep stretch and clear late under strong handling. JERSEY CUT stalked the pace while
racing between horses, took up sharply just past the three eighths pole, angled four wide through the lane and finished willingly to the wire. SHE KNOWS
MATH pressed the pace while racing two deep and weakened a bit in the latter stages. WHATEVER COMES stalked the pace, raced in tight traffic past the
three eighths marker, moved up five wide quarter pole and had not enough late. MISS INDEPENDENT pressed the pace from the inside and weakened
through the drive. CHAOS WITH LEGGS settled off the early pace, raced towards the inside and never was a factor. LA MYRY trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HANDSOME TRAVELER pressed the pace from the outside, to command into the lane finished well to draw clear late under strong encouragement. WHEN
I DO stalked the pace while along the outside, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and finished second best. STARLING stalked the pace, saved ground
and had no final winning bid. JAZZ MUSIC vied for the lead along the inside and weakened through the drive. HONOR DEPUTY stalked the pace, raced
three deep through the drive and had no late response. EARS A WINNER was slow early, moved up four into the upper stretch and never was a factor. LIL
CAPO CADDY dropped back early and never threatened. MIDNIGHT BLUES MAN was unhurried early, raced towards the inside and never was a factor.
LILJOE raced towards the back early and failed to respond. IZ NOT HOME stalked the early pace, checked past the three eighths pole and never
threatened. COUNTRY KING was slow early, raced three wide at the eighth and never menaced. AMIGO RANSOM trailed throughout.
