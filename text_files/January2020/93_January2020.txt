DEVILS ANGEL stalked the top pair from the outside to the turn, bid three deep and four wide leaving the turn, bumped by rival past the eighth pole, dueled
through the final furlong and dug in to prove best. PRINCESS RUN IT dueled from the outside with CHARMING WEEKENED into and around the turn,
drifted out and bumped in the upper stretch, fought with the winner to the wire but was outgamed. CHARMING WEEKEND dueled from the inside into and
around the turn, led into the the stretch but could not match the top pair past the sixteenth pole. REDHOTNREADYTOWED broke well and between horses
early, settled behind the speed and angled to the inside, saved ground into the stretch and lacked a response. Due to a timer malfunction the first race was
hand-timed and no fractions were recorded.
