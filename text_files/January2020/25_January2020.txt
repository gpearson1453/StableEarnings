Footnotes
SURPRISE VISIT off to an alert getaway, got guided into the three path in short order, disputed the pace as the widest of a threesome, was switched over to
stronger handling at the five-sixteenths marker, swung into the lane, whittled away at the deficit, poked a head down in front in deep stretch and edged
away. DANEGELD argued for the top from path two in between rivals, got turned loose spinning into the lane, saw the winner take over late, but finished
with willingness nevertheless to secure second. GALWAY EMPIRE underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn, was under encouragement tipping one path
farther off the rail into the stretch, mustered up a mild response to claim the show award. LUCKY E sluggish at the start, cut over to the rail, went on to
improve position in the stretch with the subsequent ground-saving journey. ALEPH strung out three to four wide on the turn, angled about five wide into the
lane, lacked the necessary stretch response. CHIRICAHUA remained along the inside route after the start, vied as the innermost of a trio until the furlong
grounds, faltered. TUXEDO SUNDAY saved ground on the turn to no avail. Dense fog hindered the viewing of the race.

Footnotes
HEAVY ROLLER four then three wide through the opening bend and fairly thick fog, settled four wide in aim of the front down the backstretch and into the
far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from home, edged away under a
drive to prevail. BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE coaxed from the gate, raced three wide through the first turn, settled in closest aim of the leader down the
backstretch in the three path, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch, took command at the three-sixteenths, dug
in and was headed a furlong out, then ran on to secure the place honors. SUPREME AURA just off the inside in the early stages, chased three to four wide
from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and improved position for the
show honors. CALIFORNIA NIGHT coaxed from the gate, established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in and yielded the front near the three-sixteenths and weakened through to the finish. KREWE CHIEF
along the inside early on, tipped three wide into the backstretch and chased from the tail of the field down the backstretch, tipped out five wide through the
far turn placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued five wide for home and made no impact. AMERICAN LINCOLN chased just off the inside under
coaxing from the half mile pole, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
FIRST DEPUTY one of three contending for the top during the initial stages, got eased back into a stalking role approaching the conclusion of the
backstretch, was rated just off the inside route keeping watch on the three front runners disputing the pace during the run around the bend, began to move
to the outside springing from the five-sixteenths pole, saw TERCERO choose a much wider route coming into the lane, got induced spinning six wide into it
as a result, displayed no signs of having been intimidated when given its cue afterwards, forged to a slim advantage at the end of the run leading up to and
then through the furlong grounds, maintained the edge and shook free. TERCERO off the inside throughout, fought from path three as the widest of three on
the turn, was allowed to sputter out into path five entering the lane, got called upon at the three-sixteenths pole, as was the winner, began the final furlong
trailing by a narrow margin, got out-dueled the remainder of the way home and had to settle for the place. BOOM BOOM KABOOM became involved with
the pace shortly after the start, argued in the two path from between opponents on the turn, kept at it until the furlong grounds and faltered. INSPECTOR
HENNING set to brisk encouragement after breaking one length the tardiest, was along the inside route prior to reaching the half mile pole, failed to menace
off the ground-saving journey that followed. SPIRITUAL KING between rivals fighting for the top early, moved over to the rail by half mile pole, was forced to
fend off a pair of foes to the outside, relinquished late on the turn, faded down the lane.

Footnotes
O SHEA CAN U SEE stalked the pace from the two path on the turn, swung out five wide entering the lane, drafted behind LOVE THAT JAZZ for much of
the opening half of the stretch run, tipped out into clear passage in midstretch and was given its cue, responded to take charge soon afterwards and kicked
clear. TOOHOTTOEVENSPEAK strung out a bit more than four wide on the turn, fanned out into path seven from upper to midlane, had a good finish down
the center of the strip to procure the place. NUCLEAR CODE tracked the pace from just off the inside, cut the corner into the lane with good clearance on
the rail corridor, worked his way to the front end during the ensuing furlong, was reeled in a sixteenth later, weakened into the show slot. NEIGHBORHOOD
BULLY along the inside route on the bend, angled out four wide for the drive home, gained, but all accomplished without impact. LOVE THAT JAZZ kept
watch on the pace from path four in midpack commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, backed away in the last eighth. WINNING WITHHONOUR
sent over to the rail at the half mile pole, tipped out towards path two at the of the lane, had no offering. THE FORTY FACTOR vied for the lead towards the
two path for the opening half, was more in the third one when driven into the lane, got caught and faltered. BRIMSTONE bobbled at the start, moved onto
the inside route, took it to the end of the bend, gave way. MAJESTIC AFFAIR pressed the pace three wide and tired.

Footnotes
SINGAPORE TRADER sparred for control from the two path, was yet being held in reserve taking over as three-quarters was being completed, got let loose
at the three-sixteenths pole, inched away to its largest lead, drifted out a bit late but had enough left to hold away. STORM PROPHET sat forwardly placed
along the inside route, was called upon for more just shy of the quarter pole, rallied for the place. VINCENTO tucked into the two path approaching the
conclusion of the backstretch, went about the bend being urged along, got sent out five wide from upper to midstretch, narrowed in to be along for the show.
JOE'S SMOKIN GUN broke through the gate, came away without apparent mishap after being re-loaded, underwent a two to three wide trip to the head of
the stretch, had no rally. DANEBURY retained the advantage after a good start, was moved onto the inside route early on the backstretch, showed the way,
shadowed by the winner, yielded as the third fraction was being recorded, stayed prominently placed for another furlong then gave way. CONTROL GROUP
strung out three to four wide on the turn, lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
CASH OFFER seven then six paths off the inside down the backstretch, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive steadily gaining through the final furlong to take command seventy yards from home, then inched away to the finish to prevail. KEPT TRUE
prompted the pace of PAUSEFORTHECAUSE to the outside six then five wide, advanced to take command swinging five wide into upper stretch, got set
down straightened away for home, dug in inching away to the eighth pole, got caught seventy yards from home while along clear for the place honors.
PAUSEFORTHECAUSE bumped at the start by FIGHT ON LUCY who broke outwards, established the front and showed the way in hand five then four
wide under some pressure from KEPT TRUE to the outside, had that pressure intensify midway on the turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung four wide for home displaced from the front, weakened in the late stages while along for the show honors. AUNT BABE five paths off the inside down
the backstretch, came under coaxing three wide at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. FIGHT ON LUCY
broke out at the start and bumped PAUSEFORTHECAUSE, chased three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. INDY'S LADY chased four wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn
under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
PEGGY SUE cemented itself to a prominent position after appearing to come away to clean break, was moved into the two path, drafted behind one of the
front runners during the run around the bend, tipped out late on the bend in preparation for the drive home, eventually turning into it nearly three wide,
grabbed control when switched over to stronger handling in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker, altered course closer to the rail then drew well clear.
BOURBON HIGH settled into midpack after the start, was four wide entering the turn and sent out five wide exiting it, proved no match en route for place
honors. APPLETINI prompted the pace two to three wide, came up to the three-sixteenths pole and was turned loose, got outfinished. NAN'S PLAN bumped
with SCOREGIRLSCORE right after the field had been released, tracked the pace towards path two on the turn, angled about four wide into the stretch,
made no late headway. ROSES FROM BEN took up the chase mostly two wide for the opening half, being on the rail briefly early on the turn, went into the
stretch, mustered up a mild kick. DAZZLING SPEED disputed the pace while spaced at a slight distance from off the rail, got headed as the half was being
completed and faltered. KINKY SOX hung out five wide on the turn, launched no bids. ITSAKEYPER travelled five wide on the turn, was sent out into the
seven path from upper to midlane, failed to get involved. SCOREGIRLSCORE bumped with its next stall neighbor after coming in at the start, saved ground
for the opening half, shifted out in the direction of the two path stepping onto the head of the stretch, lacked the needed offering. SHRINK along the inside
route, was through by the quarter pole. HERE COMES HELEN pursued the pace three wide on the turn, was moved out five wide for the drive home, came
up empty.
