Footnotes
NOMINAL DOLLARS broke readily, angled in sharply to prompt a rival's pace into the backstretch, dueled for command on that far turn into upper stretch
and narrowly prevailed in late stages under firm handling. DONE ACTING, urged to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the
backstretch, dueled for command on the far turn into upper stretch, then continued grudgingly to the end to just miss. ENTERTAINER tracked just off the
first flight along the inside to the far turn, couldn't maintain striking distance racing into the lane but edged a rival for a share in the closing stages.
LAPULGA, steadied a bit just after the start when caught in close quarters, tracked just off the leaders between foes to the far turn and faded into upper
stretch. MY LITTLE ROCKSTAR, in touch with the leaders three deep attending the pace in the opening half, gave way nearing upper stretch. PAINTER'S
PRIDE, a bit reluctant to load, was caught four wide racing into the first turn tracking just off the first flight and dropped out midway through the far turn.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF LAPULGA LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE JUST AFTER
THE START WHICH WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
LOGAN PASS, urged along the rail from the outset prompting a rival's pace, edged forward to a narrow advantage approaching the quarter mile marker,
then continued with a game effort to just hold the challenge of ANDREW THE BULL through the stretch to narrowly prevail under left handed pressure. The
latter tracked the first flight from out of striking distance in the opening quarter, shifted four wide racing into the bend advancing on the leaders in tandem
with a rival, shifted inwards while moving to terms with the winner racing through upper stretch and continued willingly while just outkicked. ELZABE'S ON
BOARD hopped, then was steadied slightly avoiding tight quarters at the start, shifted out five wide racing into the turn while being prompted to advance on
the leaders, loomed in that path racing past the quarter mile marker, drifted a bit under pressure entering upper stretch and soon flattened out. DRILL'S LI'L
MAN, forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the leaders, was urged to press the issue in that path entering the turn, continued between foes to upper
stretch and gave way. SAVAGE MUSIC angled inwards while being urged to gain a narrow advantage, dictated the pace to the turn, dueled for command
between foes entering the bend and abruptly gave way leaving the midway point of the turn.

Footnotes
MATINEE GIRL broke readily, sped to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, went well clear racing into the far turn, held sway into upper
stretch and was kept to firm left handed encouragement to maintain a comfortable margin to the end. LITTLE MARIA, held up between foes, then along the
inside to track just off the second flight to the far turn, shifted out three deep racing through the lane and edged a rival for the place honors while no real
threat to the winner. DIAMOND NEWS angled to the inside in early stages tracking just off the pacesetter, lost ground to the leader after a half, saved
ground to upper stretch and finished evenly late. WICKED WITCH, bumped just after the start, was settled last along the inside, saved ground to upper
stretch, shifted out entering the lane and gained some position between foes in the closing stages. CHIT CHAT GIRL, urged to gain a forward placing
tracking just outside the pacesetter into the first turn, continued outside a rival through the backstretch conceding some ground to the leader after a half and
steadily faded racing into upper stretch. LASTING JOY shifted inwards just after the start bumping WICKED WITCH, was righted to track off the second
flight a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch but offered no rally. TINK was rated inside foes in the opening stages, shifted out three wide on the first
turn while moving to terms with the second flight racing into the backstretch but steadily faded after a half.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE RYDER, urged to the lead along the rail racing to the first turn, dictated the pace into the backstretch, forged clear racing into the far turn, then
held sway to the end under some right handed pressure. AND I KNOW, urged to gain a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter, continued in pursuit
of that rival racing just off the inside into the far turn, couldn't close the gap but proved best of the others. THORCERESS, brushed at the start, was rated
between foes just off the second flight racing into the first turn, angled to the rail midway through the backstretch, made steady progress inside foes to gain
some position racing into the far turn, shifted out three wide racing into the stretch and finished evenly late. WINDY COUNTY broke outwards brushing a
rival, was held up along the inside tracking the leaders into the backstretch, switched out after a half, was prompted to advance nearing the far turn and
steadily faded. PIXIE'S WARRIOR angled inwards in the opening stages to track just off the leaders three deep between foes racing to the backstretch but
steadily retreated after a half. HIGH CLASS PLAYER broke inwards bumping INCA PRINCESS, was collected off that foe, then raced five wide through the
first turn, shifted inwards entering the backstretch but soon dropped out. INCA PRINCESS bobbled, then was bumped at the start, raced four wide between
foes into the first turn and soon emptied out.

Footnotes
ROSEBUD'S HOPE broke readily, was guided to the rail while gaining a narrow advantage racing to the first turn, dictated the pace under light rating to the
far turn, turned back a rival's challenge leaving the midway point of the far turn to regain a clear advantage and held sway to the end under firm right handed
encouragement. LAYLA NOOR angled to the rail in early stages tracking just off the leaders, saved ground through the far turn, was roused to advance
racing into upper stretch and prevailed for the place honors late while failing to gain even terms with the winner. CLASSY WOMAN switched off the inside
while conceding the lead racing to the first turn, tracked just off the pacesetter for a half, was prompted to advance on the pacesetter nearing the far turn,
pressed the issue through that bend, continued in pursuit into upper stretch but weakened late. JOY NIDERA (ARG), reserved last while angling nearer to
the inside leaving the chute, shifted outside foes to track off the second flight three deep through the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path
leaving the midway point of the far turn, shifted out four wide through the stretch and continued to make a mild gain while finding her best stride late. WEST
L. A. GIRL angled inwards to track just off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, was prompted to advance while shifting out three deep racing
into the lane but had no closing bid and faded late. PRIMELA (FR) ducked at the start, was settled along the rail, saved ground throughout but never
mounted a serious challenge. BARREL OF DESTINY angled inwards to track off the second flight between foes under light reserve for a half, but steadily
faded nearing the lane.

FOREFRONT was urged clear in the opening stages, then angled to the inside, held sway on a commanding margin to upper stretch and was kept to firm
encouragement to maintain a safe advantage to the end. BUC'S INVESTMINT tracked the pacesetter outside a rival as part of the second flight racing to the
turn, continued with a steady effort pursuing the winner to late stages but proved no match. QUARTERMASTER broke slowly, switched outside foes on the
backstretch, gained some position between rivals racing through the turn, then angled to the inside late while earning a share. MAMAIGOTTHIS tracked off
the second flight between foes in early stages, shifted out three wide racing through the turn while being prompted to advance but continued with an even
effort. COMMANDER'S INTENT tracked the pacesetter while angling to the inside racing through the backstretch and steadily faded after a half. DRAMA
AN VICTORY broke slowly and passed inside tiring rivals. G LUIS WARRIOR dropped out early. FED XMAN, off a step slowly, then caught five wide in
early stages while under some prompting to contend, retreated nearing the turn.

Footnotes
TOTAL TAP was rated just off the second flight while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, switched out entering the backstretch to track just off the
leaders outside a rival through the backstretch, commenced a steady advance angling three deep nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage and went
clear under firm handling. COMPLETELY BONKERS, pulling a bit against restraint while angling inwards to track off the second flight outside foes, shifted
inwards entering the backstretch while continuing under light reserve, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance and
continued willingly in that path to late stages while proving only second best. ROUGH NIGHT, urged to the fore along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow
margin to the far turn, dueled into upper stretch and weakened late. BIG MONEY MACHINE settled along the rail in the last flight racing to the backstretch,
shifted out nearing the far turn gaining some position between foes, angled out four wide nearing midstretch and continued with interest to improve his
position to the end. SAUCY DON broke inwards bumping ROUGH NIGHT, was righted to track just off the leaders outside a rival racing to the backstretch,
angled to the rail just before a half, was prompted in close quarters to lodge a brief bid inside the pacesetter nearing upper stretch but proved empty in the
drive. SYNCLINES TRIP, urged to terms with the pacesetter prompting that rival to the far turn, pressed between foes into upper stretch and gave way.
DILUTEM tracked off the second flight outside foes, was fanned four, then five wide while being urged along pursuing the leaders to upper stretch but faded
in late stages. NAUTI BUOY, held up between rivals in the last flight racing to the backstretch, never gained contention. GOLD WING was settled outside
foes in the last flight in the opening half and proved no threat. YO NO SE was prompted to gain a position inside foes in second flight racing to the first turn
but soon retreated.

SIMPLY GREAT, urged to dispute the pace along the rail through the backstretch into the turn, shifted out in upper stretch and forged clear under firm right
handed pressure. U KNOW I B LION tracked off the first flight three deep racing to the turn, advanced in that path into upper stretch and gained the place
honors in late stages. LIL B QUICK tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight, saved ground to upper stretch and finished evenly late. CHECOTAH,
urged to terms with the pacesetter prompting that rival in the opening stages, pressed the issue on the turn to upper stretch and gave way. ALLURING
APPROVAL tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the turn, then faded into upper stretch. FIRST HOOSIER broke in the air while
dropping out last in the opening stages and never gained contention. LIL HOOH'S HOOH, bumped lightly at the start, switched out four wide tracking off the
second flight in the opening stages but soon retreated.

Footnotes
SUGAR FIX angled to the rail in the opening stages stalking just off the leaders under light restraint, continued under patient handling saving ground through
the far turn, switched outside the pacesetter to wrest command racing into upper stretch and went well clear under firm encouragement. PEARLS FOR
JOSIE, off a bit slowly, was reserved while angling to the rail, saved ground into the far turn gathering momentum, switched off the inside making light
contact with REVELMENT in upper stretch but continued with interest between foes just off the inside to prevail for the place honors. RENEESINHEAVEN,
pulling against restraint while held up avoiding close quarters inside foes just off the second flight, shifted outside foes nearing the far turn, was prompted to
advance three deep nearing upper stretch, couldn't match the winner's late kick but kept on with interest to edge a rival for a share. LADY JORDAN, urged
to the lead angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to upper stretch but gave way once headed by the winner. MOMS LOVE, held up
avoiding close quarters in early stages, tracked well off the second flight to the far turn, angled out five wide racing into the stretch but made no impact.
ETTAPLACE, urged to terms prompting the pacesetter through the opening stages to the far turn, gave way into upper stretch. REVELMENT angled
inwards to track off the second flight between foes, was prompted to advance just off the inside nearing the lane, altered course slightly avoiding traffic near
midstretch and had no late response. BIZ MAKER tracked outside foes off the second flight for a half, was caught wide into the far turn and soon faded.
CLEARLY SEEN settled along the inside early and failed to menace. TOLLY CLUB switched out three deep early while prompted to a forward placing,
lodged a brief bid nearing the far turn but emptied out early.
