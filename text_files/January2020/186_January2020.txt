Footnotes
HOMERS MAGIC switched outside the pacesetter in early stages tracking just off that rival to the far turn, took over racing into upper stretch and went well
clear late under firm encouragement. CAPTAINONTHEROCKS was settled between foes early, shifted out on the backstretch, circled rivals five wide racing
through the far turn and continued with interest to secure the place honors. RARE HUE broke sharply, was urged to the lead just off the inside, held sway to
the far turn but gave way once headed by the winner. ROCKY DIPLOMAT tracked off the second flight along the inside, angled four wide to race between
foes in that path on the far turn but had no closing bid. GOOFY BOY dropped out early. LITTLE GUY tracked the leaders three deep as part of the second
flight and steadily faded nearing the lane. COOL RIVER DS angled inside early to track just off the pacesetter, was prompted to make brief progress on the
far turn but emptied out entering upper stretch. HAPPY GUY settled outside foes and faded early.

Footnotes
WAPITI WAY was urged to the lead along the inside, dueled for command into the turn, then past midstretch but edged forward late under firm
encouragement. NO CHOICE broke inwards bumping WELD forcing that rival into PATCH'S LUGH, was quickly righted, then urged pressing a rival's pace
racing into the turn, dueled past midstretch but yielded late. FOURTH DESIGN, brushed at the start, tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the
turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch while being prompted to advance, came under some correction when lugging inwards a bit midstretch and was
not persevered with in the final stages. WELD, bumped at the start then forced into PATCH'S LUGH, angled to the rail tracking just off the first flight racing
into the turn, then weakened late. EARLY DELIGH, restless before the start, hopped at the start, settled last on the backstretch, angled out to the six path
midstretch and made some belated progress. MR CHOCOLATE CHIP tracked off the second flight racing four wide into the turn and continued evenly. J'S
FLASHY HALO tracked off the second flight between foes and continued evenly to late stages. JEDI TEMPLE broke inwards brushing FOURTH DESIGN,
angled to the inside tracking off the second flight to the turn and faded into the lane. PATCH'S LUGH, brushed at the start, was a bit slow into stride and
never menaced.

LIAM'S LUCKY CHARM, urged to the lead along the inside in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the turn, shifted out nearing the
three sixteenth marker bumping MY MAN FLINTSONE while also carrying out ALBERT PARK but kicked away to a clear advantage and extended the
margin under brisk right handed pressure. ALBERT PARK stalked just outside the first flight under light reserve in the opening quarter, was prompted to
terms with the first flight three deep after a half, was carried out racing into upper stretch losing ground to the pacesetter but continued with a steady effort to
edge a rival for the place honors. NO GETTING OVER ME, urged along pursuing the first flight while angling to the inside, came through when presented an
opening in upper stretch but was outkicked for second. HE'S SMOKIN NOW settled outside foes in early stages, angled to the inside nearing the lane to
gain some position but had no closing bid. MY MAN FLINTSTONE broke sharply, prompted the pace outside the eventual winner, then between foes on the
turn, was bumped while being forced into the path of ALBERT PARK racing into upper stretch and quickly came up empty. GOLDEN CANDY, bumped at
the start, settled well off the leaders, shifted out four wide nearing the lane but offered no rally. BIG YES broke outwards bumping GOLDEN CANDY at the
start and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
COLTRANE broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the far turn, kicked clear racing into upper stretch and held gamely to
the end under firm right handed encouragement. TELEKINESIS, a bit rank against restraint inside foes in the second flight racing to the first turn, tracked the
pacesetter along the rail to the far turn, shifted outside that foe leaving midstretch and found his best stride late to close the gap. OUTRAGEOUS BET
tracked off the second flight along the inside to the far turn, shifted out midstretch and improved position between foes in the closing stages. DOVER
CLIFFS, forwardly placed stalking just off the pacesetter racing to the far turn, weakened into the stretch. POWER WALKER tracked off the first flight
outside a rival to the far turn, angled out four wide racing through the lane but had no late kick. EPIC (ARG) tracked off the second flight outside foes, was
fanned five wide in the stretch and had no rally. AND WON settled last and never gained contention.

Footnotes
DUDLEY SQUARE joined the pace four wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue three wide through the turn to upper stretch and edged forward
nearing the wire under firm handling. SKY MISCHIEF tracked off the first flight near the inside racing to the turn, angled four wide in upper stretch and
continued willingly to edge a rival for the place honors nearing the wire. ROUGH ENTRY vied for command inside foes disputing the pace just off the rail
racing into the turn, dueled into upper stretch and yielded nearing the wire. HERE COMES BULLET, urged between foes prompting the pace from the outset
into the turn, weakened nearing midstretch. DRAMA CHORUS, off a step slowly, tracked off the second flight near the inside racing into the turn but had no
closing bid. ACTION WARRIOR, urged three wide between foes prompting the pace, gave way early. JANGADA bore out in early stages while going
erratically and never seriously menaced. SWIPE LEFT broke awkwardly and trailed into the stretch

Footnotes
BELLO PORTE moved readily to the fore while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin to the far turn, shook clear racing into the lane
and held sway to the end under firm handling. LADY OXBOW settled while angling inside early, shifted out on the far turn, advanced five wide racing into
the stretch and continued with a steady late response to edge a rival for the place honors. SHELTER ISLAND (FR) tracked off the first flight along the inside,
shifted out in upper stretch while being roused to close the gap on the winner but had no late kick. MY LITTLE ROSY tracked off the second flight while
angling inside, saved ground to upper stretch and continued inside foes with a mild bid. AGI'S CAIT, reserved last while shifting off the inside, angled six
wide nearing midstretch and gained some position while making no real impression. BLONDE MOMENT, fractious in the gate before the start, tracked the
leaders outside a rival in second flight to the far turn, then gave way into the stretch. VENETIAN PRINCESS, urged to a forward placing stalking just off the
pacesetter racing to the far turn, emptied out in the drive. ALYDARIUS tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the far turn but offered no rally.

Footnotes
JEHOZACAT broke readily, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin under light rating into the backstretch, shook clear entering the far
turn and was roused racing into the stretch to widen the advantage to the end. TWEETING tracked the pacesetter inside foes in the opening half, shifted out
nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance, couldn't gain terms with the winner but prevailed for the place honors. CLASSIC FIT, bumped when
caught in tight quarters between foes when prompted to a forward placing racing to the first turn, tracked off the first flight outside a rival to the backstretch,
shifted out three wide racing into the far turn while being urged to advance, then continued in that path into the stretch while lacking the needed final bid.
HUNTING SEASON, unhurried while caught four wide racing into the first turn, settled off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted nearer the
inside after a half and made some late progress to improve her position between rivals in the closing stages. TAP DANCE STAR settled last while angling
inside racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide in upper stretch and displayed some mild interest late. ALL GOOD TIMES angled inwards while being
prompted to a forward placing making contact with CLASSIC FIT racing into the first turn, gained a position tracking just off the pacesetter through the
backstretch and emptied out between foes nearing upper stretch. HELEN switched off the inside racing to the first turn while tracking off the second flight
and retreated early.

Footnotes
BLUE PIGEON was settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, gradually gathered momentum shifting out on the far turn, angled six wide
racing into upper stretch while advancing to challenge, was carried out leaving midstretch but narrowly prevailed on the wire under firm encouragement.
WICKED BOY tracked off the second flight shifting a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, angled out on the far turn to advance on the leaders five
wide between foes racing into upper stretch, struck the front between calls in late stages, then drifted out while being roused to resist the winner's bid but
couldn't contain that foe. NO CENTS LEFT, steadied out of tight quarters in the opening stages, tracked off the second flight saving ground to the
backstretch, continued along the inside into the far turn, was taken in hand avoiding close quarters, then shifted out five wide racing into upper stretch, split
foes in that path and produced some late stride to close the gap on the top pair. DON'S MARSH tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight to the far
turn, advanced to challenge four wide nearing upper stretch, gained a brief advantage midstretch but couldn't sustain that momentum. ALMOREB settled
last racing to the backstretch, was fanned seven wide into the stretch and gained some position in an even effort. PERP tracked the leaders between foes in
second flight to the far turn, briefly awaited an opening racing into the lane while shifting out four deep but had no late kick. TOSS, in touch with the leaders
three deep prompting the pace racing into the far turn, dueled between foes in that path nearing the lane and gave way midstretch. NEW JERSEY JOHN
angled inside tracking just off the first flight racing to the far turn, raced in close quarters inside foes nearing the lane but lacked the needed late bid. HILLS
POND vied between foes prompting the pace to the far turn and gave way into the stretch. DAD'S YANKEES, urged to the lead along the rail, dueled for
command inside foes into the far turn and gave way abruptly entering upper stretch.

Footnotes
TWO SIXTY showed quickly in front, angled inwards a bit dictating the pace between rivals on a narrow margin racing into the turn, shook clear racing into
upper stretch, drifted out through the closing stages, was headed nearing the wire but dug in with a determined effort to prove narrowly best. MO CITY was
rated five wide just off the second flight racing through the backstretch, advanced on the leaders racing four wide through the turn to upper stretch, shifted
inside the winner while being roused to challenge inside that foe nearing the wire but just missed. WE THE CLOUDS, urged to gain a position inside rivals in
the second flight in the opening stages, came around a tiring foe to advance between foes just off the inside, angled to the rail nearing upper stretch and
continued with a steady bid to late stages while just outkicked by the top pair and narrowly prevailing for a share on the wire. CECI VALENTINA tracked the
leaders four wide, then three wide between foes in second flight racing into the turn, angled out six wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to close
the gap while just outkicked. SWISS SKYDIVER, climbing a bit between foes dropping off the second flight in the opening stages, was reserved racing to
the bend, shifted out advancing five wide leaving the midway point of the turn, was urged to challenge the winner four wide between foes leaving midstretch
but was floated out by that foe late while losing her momentum and just missing for a share. PALACE MISS settled last off the inside racing to the turn, was
fanned six wide into upper stretch and gained some position while making no real impression. VERUCA, restless in the gate, was urged between foes to
gain terms with the pacesetter, switched outside that foes prompting the leader three deep racing into the turn but gave way entering upper stretch. GERRI
B, urged to gain a forward placing four wide racing on terms with the first flight, lodged a brief bid in that path entering the turn but proved empty in the drive.
JUDY'S WAY tracked the leaders in second flight three wide, then between foes into the turn and steadily faded into upper stretch. CAMPY CASH angled to
the inside early while being prompted to maintain a position just behind the second flight but soon dropped out. RANDIABBY, brushed at the start, was
urged inside rivals chasing the pacesetter into the turn but was spent early.

Footnotes
SILVER BANK broke inwards bumping CECI'SAPRILHOTTIE, shifted out while being collected, steadily advanced on the leaders racing into the turn, was
urged to split foes three deep nearing midstretch to challenge inside the leader and just edged that foe in time under firm right handed pressure. BUCKY'S
DRAMA angled inwards while being urged to press the pace between rivals racing into the turn, shifted out while gaining a narrow advantage midstretch,
resisted the winner's challenge but proved only second best. FAIRY DIVA (GB), forwardly placed along the inside tracking just off the first flight, bid for
command along the rail when presented an opening in upper stretch but was outkicked. BRAMBLE BERRY, urged to terms with the first flight three deep
pressing the pace into the turn, was floated four wide into the stretch and weakened late. NAGINI tracked off the first flight outside foes, advanced nearing
the lane to bid five wide in upper stretch but finished evenly between foes late. WRAPPING prompted to a position between foes in second flight while
angling inwards in the opening stages, swung out six wide racing into the stretch and gained some position late while making no real impression. TRASH
PANDA hopped at the start, was settled near the inside and never gained contention. BILLYSBIRTHDAYGIRL, urged to dispute the pace inside foes from
the outset into the turn, gave way nearing midstretch. TENERIFE MOON broke slowly, then was shut off while being bumped at the start and proved no
threat. CECI'SAPRILHOTTIE, bumped by the winner while forced into TENERIFE MOON at the start, was collected off that foe, then trailed throughout.
