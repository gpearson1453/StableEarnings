Footnotes
BLACK OPS broke sharply to press the pace of FLASHAWAY while racing four-wide, dropped off that rival after going three furlongs, remained four-wide
through the second turn, responded when set down for the drive and wore down that foe in the closing yards to be going away late. FLASHAWAY was away
in good order then hustled along to set the early fractions while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the five-eighths marker, remained in
control through mid-stretch but could not resist the winner through the final sixteenth. SHERIFF BROWN lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the
second turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with good late energy. DEPUTY'S ECHO raced off the pacesetters throughout, moved four-wide
through both turns and lacked the needed closing response. FIVE STAR KIP was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and
gradually weakened. PASAMONTE MAN chased the leaders from the inside for five furlongs and weakened. DAWOOD lagged throughout.

pace, raced off the rail into the turn, drifted out in mid stretch, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best. E BAR GOLD pressed the early pace,
went four wide into the turn, and weakened in late stretch. SOLID GOLD BAR was up close early, raced between rivals and faded. THE GREAT DOME was
taken back early, circled eight wide through the turn and offered no late rally. LOOSEWHEELSLOUIE was void of any early speed, went three wide into the
turn, angled in and never fired. JERSEY VILLAGE was unhurried early and was no factor. THE GHOST OF DIXIE raced in mid pack early, went five wide
into the turn and gave way. KARISSA BALLERINA stalked the early pace from the inside and tired.
