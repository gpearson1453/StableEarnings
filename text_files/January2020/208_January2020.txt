Footnotes
GOES TOO FAST sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch under left handed urging to win
as much the best. REALLY RED chased the winner all the way and finished well clear for second in the four path. MISTER MOBIL trailed along the rail into
the stretch, shifted out to the five path past the three sixteenths pole then passed tiring rivals. IRON MEN OF METZ stalked the early pace three wide and
lacked the needed response. OLE WATASHI had brief speed. SLICK GRIT was no factor.

Footnotes
TALKING ZIP prompted the pace two wide into the far turn, put a head in front, set the balance of the pace under strong pressure and wore down rivals in a
game effort. DINESEN never far back, loomed boldly five wide at the top of the stretch then finished second best. TROPICAL CYCLONE stalked the pace
then four wide, drew on near even terms for the lead near the furlong marker then was outfinished. BORA BORA trailed for nearly a half, split horses two
wide in upper stretch then leveled off in the final stages. GIANT'S FORREST failed to menace. CEE'S AWESOME was no threat. EMPIREMEISTER had
speed for six furlongs then weakened. MY KINDA KID was no factor. SIDNEY'S RANSOM away alertly, set a pressured pace for nearly six furlongs then
folded along the rail.

Footnotes
CASCABRIA never far back, closed four wide through the stretch and was along in time under right handed urging. CLASSIC ARCH allowed to settle, rallied
determinedly through the stretch along the inside and got up for second. ANNISQUAM dueled for the lead three then two wide into the stretch, shook clear,
remained in control until the final stages and was outfinished. I GOT THE TIME closed some ground late five wide. IVY O'DAY close up, loomed boldly four
then three wide through mid stretch, lugged in and leveled off. JERSEY CHASER stumbled at the start then found her best stride late six wide. DEE WAY
TO GO broke in front, battled for the lead two wide then near the inside, had speed until deep stretch then weakened. DRESSED IN HEELS was no factor.
LOW TIRE had brief speed. ENIGMA vied for the early lead along the rail and gave way on the stretch.

Footnotes
CAPT BILLY BUD stalked the turn, loomed boldly three wide before a half, matched strides until deep stretch and drew away late under left handed urging.
TRUEST OF THEM ALL made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner. CAPTAIN RILEY
unhurried early, closed fast two wide through the stretch. KING CORN vied for the lead along the inside, dropped back on the turn then came on again late.
KOLE MAN CAN pressed the pace three then two wide, drew on even terms for the lead, battled until late stretch then faded. LUZON CHARGER offered a
bid five wide on the turn then leveled off. MY MAN ARCHIE with the second flight two wide, failed to respond. HAMMERS SON was no factor. ROLLIN ON
TEQUILA allowed to settle, closed willingly four wide into the stretch, lugged in and dropped back under a firm hold through the final furlong. FREEKSON
had speed along the inside into the turn then weakened. HEIDI'S SINATRA showed little. ROLLIN INSIDE OUT was outrun.
