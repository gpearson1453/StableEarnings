Footnotes
BLUE BOMBER went to the front, drove clear, moved to the rail, dueled down the stretch with BUXTERHOOTER and prevailed for the win.
BUXTERHOOTER pressed the pace, raced outside around both turns, dueled down the stretch, was outfinished for the win, but held off WHY GOD for
second. WHY GOD lacked early speed, made a steady gain, rallied down the home stretch and closed fast on the top two. EXTON challenged for the early
lead, forwardly placed throughout and weakened down the stretch. COOKIES ARE GOOD void of early speed and was never close. BLUE WARRIOR
lacked early speed and showed little. POINT HOPE was an early factor, saved ground around the final turn and faded.

Footnotes
ONETWOMANYROCKETS unhurried in the early going, moved up on the outside around the final turn, swung to the outside entering the stretch, rallied
down the lane, angled out more down the stretch and drove clear, finishing strong. GAL reserved in the back in the beginning, moved up, five wide around
the second turn, rallied down the stretch, but couldn't match strides with the winner late. DIAL EM IN raced within striking distance, came around the final
turn four wide, made a bid and was outfnished by the top two. SILVER SIREN pressed the pace, saved ground around the final turn, made a game try, but
lacked a late kick. OUR EASTER LILY was an early factor, forwardly placed until late, faded deep in the home stretch. LINDA'S LEGACY went to the front
and was finished early.

Footnotes
GOOSE stalked the leader in the early going, moved up around the final turn, angled out, pulled away down the stretch and proved much the best.
DEWEY'S LITTLE JOE sprinted to the front, drove clear, couldn't keep up with the winner late, but was a clear second. UNBRIDLED PULPIT broke a step
slow, racing in the rear, made a late gain and was up for third. BAYANDBUNNY lacked early speed, made a wide late gain and was outfinished for third.
CHAN MAN raced within contention, weakened and lacked a finish. MY HARVEY hopped at the start, raced in the back and was never a threat. FREE TO
GO raced within striking distance, saved ground around the final turn and faded. ITSLONELYONTHEEDGE raced in the middle of the pack in the early part
and retreated to the back.
