Footnotes
KID DRAMA broke readily to race on terms with the pacesetter in the four path in the opening stages, continued in that path conceding some position to the
pacesetter racing into the turn, was prompted to advance leaving the midway point of the bend and steadily gained on the pacesetter under right handed
pressure to narrowly prevail in time under firm handling. SIR SWAYSALOT ducked out at the start forcing out TITHED, was quickly righted, then sped to the
lead along the inside racing to the turn, turned back a rival's challenge leaving the bend to gain a clear advantage in upper stretch but couldn't contain the
winner's final bid. TITHED, forced out at the start while crossing over the path of RUBENSLEGACY, pulled his way against firm rating to gain terms with the
pacesetter racing into the turn, pressed the issue to upper stretch and gave way. TINKER'S PAL broke a step slowly while shying from traffic at the start,
angled nearer to the inside tracking the leaders from out of striking distance into the turn and had no closing response. RUBENSLEGACY, cut off at the
start, never gained contention. ESTILO PELIGROSO broke a bit slowly and failed to menace thereafter.

Footnotes
ENDUROS TIGRESS broke readily, was rated off the leaders between foes tracking the pace into the turn, shifted out three deep making light contact with
EXTRA SALSA while being prompted to advance entering the bend, for for command three deep between rivals, wrested the advantage racing into upper
stretch and went clear under firm right handed encouragement. GUCCIGUCCIGIRL angled inwards in the opening stages while gaining terms with a rival
prompting the pace, dueled for command between foes through the turn to upper stretch but proved only second best. EXTRA SALSA tracked off the first
flight three deep between foes in the opening quarter, was prompted to advance in tandem with the eventual winner racing into the turn while being lightly
bumped, then fanned four into the turn, continued in pursuit of the top pair to upper stretch but flattened out in the closing stages while holding a rival for a
share. MISS HELEN tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out to gain some position between foes on the bend but lacked the
needed final kick. MEMORABLE ANGEL tracked off the first flight four wide, then five wide racing to the turn and faded early, then was gathered up in the
closing stages. SUNSHINE SMILES, urged to the lead along the inside in the opening stages, dueled for command racing into the turn and gave way into
upper stretch.

Footnotes
GLOBAL DINNER, a bit reluctant to load in the gate, tracked the leaders outside foes from just out of striking distance racing four wide to the backstretch,
shifted inwards after a half to advance on the pacesetter three deep nearing the far turn, was prompted to wrest command in that path leaving the three
furlong marker, shifted to the inside once gaining a clear advantage racing into upper stretch and maintained a safe margin to the end under some left
handed encouragement. BATTLE CREEK ducked inwards at the start bumping PRETTY CHITU, was urged to the lead while angling inwards racing into the
backstretch, shifted out after a half setting the pace into the far turn, had no response when challenged by the winner, shifted out while being roused in
pursuit of that foe into upper stretch but proved no match. PRETTY CHITU, bumped at the start while being forced into the path of DUXBURY, was righted
to track just off the pacesetter along the inside racing to the far turn, switched out three deep in upper stretch but steadily faded. ARES WARRIOR, urged
along from the break three deep between foes prompting the pacesetter into the backstretch, tracked just off that foe between foes for a half and gave way
nearing the far turn. DUXBURY was crowded at the start, settled along the inside and failed to menace thereafter. MIGHTY PETE broke sharply, was eased
off the pace while angling inwards a bit to race between foes to the backstretch but dropped out early.

PERFETTO sped to the fore from the break racing a bit off the inside into the backstretch, was rated in hand attending a rival's pace while being headed
momentarily after a half, dueled for command inside a rival into the far turn and was roused to edge clear under firm right handed pressure in the closing
stages. TALK TO THE MEDIA angled inwards a bit to track just off the leaders, continued outside a rival into the backstretch, was prompted to advance
three wide on the far turn to gain terms with the leaders between calls entering upper stretch but was outkicked by the winner while edging a rival for the
place honors. POLYGRAM, in touch attending a rival's pace racing into the backstretch, pressed the issue nearing the far turn gaining a narrow advantage,
dueled for command outside the winner to upper stretch but proved no match late. UNSPOILED MOMENTS tracked off the second flight off the inside
racing to the far turn, angled inside entering the stretch and continued with an even effort. SIX SIDED BLING broke a bit slowly, settled off the inside and
never gained contention. PAPA CALIENTE was prompted to gain a forward placing along the tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, shifted out
racing into the far turn and emptied out early. TO YOUR HEALTH trailed throughout.

HONEST TO GOODNESS was settled along the rail dropping well off the second flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn while
advancing in close quarters nearing upper stretch, shifted out to split foes just off the inside nearing midstretch, wrested the advantage and went clear under
firm handling. QUALITY STEP, restless in the gate, tracked off the second flight between foes under rating to the backstretch, briefly awaited an opening
nearing upper stretch, angled out five wide entering the lane and produced a solid late response to prove best of the others. FLIGHT DECK, held up out of
close quarters just after the start, was settled along the rail, saved ground through the far turn and found his best stride in the closing stages splitting foes
just off the inside to prevail for a share in time despite being bumped by PURE LUCK approaching the wire. PURE LUCK switched out racing into the first
turn while being prompted to a forward placing between foes, was urged to duel for command between foes into the far turn, weakened in upper stretch and
bumped FLIGHT DECK nearing the wire. PARADISE ISLAND switched off the inside tracking just off the leaders between foes racing to the backstretch,
shifted four wide nearing the far turn while being prompted to advance, continued in that path to upper stretch but had no late kick. HONEY DONT tracked
the leaders outside foes in second flight to the backstretch, advanced three deep racing into the far turn to briefly challenge for command but flattened out
midstretch. FADE AWAY tracked the pace outside rivals off the second flight in the opening half, was fanned six wide into the stretch had no closing bid.
FAST FLYING FRED, urged to gain a forward placing while angling inside, tracked just off the leaders inside foes, shifted out racing through the far turn but
had no late response. TRULY STELLAR was urged to gain the lead outside foes, angled to the rail entering the first turn while gaining the advantage,
dueled for command into the far turn and gave way into the stretch. LIZ MORE BOY, caught wide leaving the chute racing to the first tur while being urged
to forward placing, prompted the leaders three deep for a half and dropped out early.

GET REWARDED was rated just off the leaders along the inside while pulling against restraint, steadied a bit while shifting out slightly nearing upper
stretch, was roused to split foes challenging for command when presented an opening in upper stretch, drifted out markedly through the last furlong despite
right handed pressure but just edged BETTYB on the wire. The latter gained a forward placing while shifting outside the pacesetter, raced on terms with that
rival attending the pace under rating through the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes into upper stretch, drifted out while shying from GET
REWARDED in the closing stages and just missed. BIZNESS BEAUTY tracked off the second flight along the inside under rating, swung out five wide
racing into upper stretch and continued willingly outside foes to close the gap on the top pair while edging a rival for a share. SHENU SHENUME tracked the
leaders outside foes off the second flight in the opening half, was prompted to advance four wide leaving the midway point of the far turn to challenge for
command in that path in upper stretch, moved to terms with the top pair between foes leaving midstretch but was steadied out of tight quarters when losing
her path nearing the wire. CLASSY LYNN tracked just off the first flight outside a rival racing to the far turn, shifted out three deep on the second bend to bid
between foes nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. C. A. C. CHAQUIRA, urged to gain the lead while angling to the rail, set the pace on a
narrow margin for a half, dueled for command on the far turn into upper stretch and gave way late. MS. AMETHYST hopped at the start, settled off the
inside but never seriously menaced. GRACE'S WILD CAT dropped out of contention early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND DISQUALIFIED GET REWARDED FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HER FOURTH.

Footnotes
ZECHARIAH broke readily to secure a narrow advantage just off the inside racing through the backstretch, dictated the pace off the rail racing into the turn,
forged clear under some prompting in upper stretch and widened the margin to the end in a ridden out effort. ACTSPECTATION tracked off the second flight
five wide in the opening stages, continued four wide into the bend, shifted inwards racing into the stretch and edged a rival for the place honors while no
threat to the winner. ED'S DOG, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening stages, angled to the rail entering the turn
while being urged to challenge inside the leader but steadily weakened into the stretch. NATION U S A tracked off the second flight between foes in the
opening stages, swung out five wide entering the lane and improved his position. TEMPLE MOUNT tracked off the second flight between foes racing into
the turn and continued evenly to late stages. THE SPIDER tracked just off the pacesetter racing three deep as part of the second flight to the turn, then
steadily faded into the lane. FLASH MAN angled inside early tracking off the second flight and soon retreated. SWEEPINGTHENATION proved no factor. K
C TWOSTEP tracked the leaders four wide between foes in the opening stages but emptied out early.

Footnotes
STORMY D, reserved three deep tracking well off the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled inwards racing into the far turn gathering momentum,
split foes just off the inside advancing on the leaders, shifted out three wide midstretch and reeled in ADULT IN THE ROOM to narrowly prevail in time
under stout left handed encouragement. The latter was guided to the rail tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight in the opening stages, steadily
drew into striking distance nearing the far turn, switched outside the pacesetter when presented an opening to challenge that rival racing into upper stretch,
struck the front between calls late and just failed to contain the winner. SWEET BLOSSOM sped to the fore along the rail to the first turn, dictated the pace
on a narrow margin to the second bend, dueled inside the top to late stages but yielded nearing the wire. ITSGOTTABEMYWAY was settled along the rail in
the opening half tracking well off the leaders, saved ground to upper stretch and gained some position while never menacing the top trio. RIPROARING,
urged to terms with the pacesetter prompting that rival into the backstretch, pressed the issue into the far turn and gave way into the lane. AGUAS
COLORADAS was settled outside foes in the opening stages, advanced four, then five wide racing into upper stretch, was carried wider through the lane by
WHITEHEELGIRL and never gained striking distance. WHITEHEELGIRL tracked the leaders in the three path as part of the second flight racing to the
backstretch, advanced in that path to press the leaders racing into the far turn, drifted out racing into upper stretch impeding a rival and quickly gave way.
GO YEOWOMEN broke inwards bumping DON'T FIGHT IT, angled inwards while being settled between foes racing to the backstretch and offered no rally.
DON'T FIGHT IT, bumped at the start, was settled last and never gained contention.

Footnotes
JORNS was reserved outside foes racing to the backstretch, came under some prompting on the far turn, was fanned seven wide in upper stretch and
responded when called upon to produce a stout rally to reel in MR. MAURICE to wrest the advantage in time under firm encouragement. The latter tracked
outside rivals in second flight in the opening half, advanced three wide racing into the far turn to challenge for command in upper stretch, gained a brief
advantage but couldn't fend off the winner. ROLLER ROLLS ON, settled out of close quarters at the break along the inside, swung out five wide nearing
upper stretch into the path of G FRIDAY but continued with interest to edge a rival for a share on the wire. CORCORAN, unhurried along the inside tracking
just off the second flight to the backstretch, shifted out after a half, was prompted to advance four wide nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final
kick. IFEELGOOD, urged to the lead along the inside, dueled for command into the far turn and gave way nearing midstretch. MORO DRAMA angled to the
rail tracking just off the first flight, saved ground into the far turn, shifted out there wide in upper stretch but had no closing bid. G FRIDAY was settled
outside foes in early stages, shifted out on the far turn while being urged to advance, was carried six wide racing into upper stretch and had no late
response. I HAVE HOPE tracked the leaders in second flight between foes to the far turn and faded early. PIRATE EXPLOSIVE, urged to terms prompting a
rival's pace, gave way nearing the lane. SOMMER LEGACY made brief pursuit of the leaders three wide into the first turn, shifted well wide on the
backstretch and was spent early.
