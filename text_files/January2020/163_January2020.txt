Footnotes
VIDALIA settled off the pace and angled to the inside, saved ground into the lane, rallied up the inside and drew clear under right-handed urging.
GODDESS APHRODITE traveled mid-pack up the backstretch from off the rail, went three wide around the turn, angled out further in the stretch, rallied and
edged PETRONILLA for the place honors. PETRONILLA stalked from the inside, bid from the inside and gained command a bit off the rail into the stretch,
overtaken by the winner mid-stretch and was outfinished for the placed. LADY LECLAIR broke through the gate prior to the start, traveled off the rail then
angled in and saved ground around the turn, angled out in the stretch but lacked a rally. GRACIE'S GIRL tracked off the rail, went two wide into the stretch
and also lacked a rally. LINDA AND MINDA set the pace from off the rail, led from the three path on the turn and nearing the eighth pole and gave way.
LALA FLEUR broke through the gate prior to the start, lacked early speed, raced two wide through the turn and never threatened. DEVILISH SUNSET off
slow at the beginning, settled off the pace, saved ground along the inside and had little left for the stretch.
