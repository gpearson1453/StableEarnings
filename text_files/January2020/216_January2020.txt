THE KIPPY TRAIN bumped at the start, set the pace, drew off on the turn and held safely under steady urging. CLASSY PAPA pressed the pace to the
turn, fell back, lacked the needed late rally and finished second best. MUY BUENO bumped on both sides at the start, showed good early speed while
racing inside, fell back on the turn and finished evenly. THERACEENDHERE raced mid pack in an even effort and was outrun. MR NAVIGATOR broke
awkwardly, was void of early speed, went nine wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid. SUNDAY DANCER was not a factor.

ALL IN STEW OUI set the pace, drew off on the turn, extended his lead, won easily and finished much the best. MY GOLDEN BOY was never far back,
went five wide at the top of the stretch, offered a mild bid to get up for place and was no threat to the winner. HYPERSONIC bumped and was squeezed at
the start, was never far back, bid, came up empty and held safely for show. HONOR STRIKE chased the pace, tired on the second turn and gave way. TRE
bumped at the start, lagged while racing outside and lacked a bid. RAGING CAJUN CASEY bumped at the start, was steadied on the first turn and failed to
contend. ROAD TO MY DREAM broke in and bumped at the start, trailed the field and failed to contend.

SUCCESS RATE set the pace with a clear lead and held safely while kept to task. DAD'S A GAMBLER advanced to the turn, angled out for the drive,
closed well and gained late. PLUM LUCKY chased the pace, bid, came up empty and settled for show. DUKATI was never far back, raced outside, lacked a
stretch response and dropped back. CHEAP O CHARLIE was never far back, had nothing left for the drive and dropped back. ACT UP raced outside and
had brief speed only. THE ROCK ROLLS was not a factor. DREAMCATCHER stumbled at the start and lost his rider. The stewards' posted an inquiry
concerning the start. No change was made.

BABY ROSE drew off early, was unchallenged, won easily and was much the best. SHINE ON ME bumped mildly at the start, put in a steady effort to earn
place and was no match for the winner. WIN HANNAH LYNN was unhurried early, bid inside on the turn, lacked a rally and was best of the rest. WARTIME
LADY was void of early speed, put in a steady effort and improved position. JERRYS WAY raced outside, went six wide entering the stretch, lacked a bid
and was outrun. ALOHA SPIRIT broke out and bumped at the start, lagged while racing outside and lacked a bid. ANALYZE HER STYLE had brief speed
only. ENDEARMENT had brief speed only.

CALESE was hustled along to set the pace and held safely under steady urging. LUCKY MAC stalked the pace while racing inside, lacked the needed late
response and finished second best. ROSES FOR DOUG was never far off the pace, failed to rally and won the battle for show. FRAN'S EMPIRE was never
far back, lacked a rally and failed to menace. ESTRELLA POLAR was void of early speed, saved ground, bid along the rail and came up empty. TEQUILA Y
MIEL raced six wide along the backstretch and failed to threaten in an even effort. FORT DODGE RD pressed the pace, was through early and dropped
back. TALK ABOUT BIANCA raced seven wide along the backstretch, had her rider lose his whip mid stretch and was outrun.

Footnotes
NUDIAMOND was roused on the turn, went six wide entering the stretch, closed in an even course and wore down his rivals to get up late. I'M AN EIGHT
pressed the pace while racing along the inside in hand, assumed command on the turn, drew off for a clear lead, led to deep stretch and was outclosed to
finish second best. XTREME LYRA set a pressured pace to the turn, fell back, leveled off and settled for show. PARLAY PONTI was unhurried early, saved
ground to the turn, angled out and finished well. HOLLYWOOD SQUARE raced outside, showed speed to the second turn, weakened and faded through the
stretch. RIDE HARD KOWBOY was taken outside, showed speed to the second turn, tired and gave way.
