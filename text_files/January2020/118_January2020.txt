Footnotes
LOOKBOTHWAYS an early pace factor, was allowed to drop back, tipped out to be three wide coming up to the top of the turn, advanced towards the front
runners, got roused spinning into the stretch, emerged at the eighth pole as the new leader by a narrow margin, kept going well to kick clear. ABRAXAN
along the outside throughout, crept up to WISCONSIN NIGHT after departing the backstretch, went by without that opponent putting up much resistance,
failed to shake free and instead had the winner take aim shortly afterwards, came under a drive as three-quarters was being completed, got overhauled in
the furlong grounds, stayed on for the place. APPRECIATE parked out four wide on the turn, lacked the needed response. WISCONSIN NIGHT disputed
the pace anywhere from the two path to the inside route for the opening half, relinquished readily and wilted.

Footnotes
MOHICAN raced two to three wide in aim of the leader, advanced in the far turn coming under coaxing when poking a head in front at the five-sixteenths,
spun just off the inside for home, drew clear under a drive kept to task. ORPHEUS (ARG) along the inside through the first turn, tracked the front from just
off the inside down the backstretch, tipped four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, proved no
match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. TOUR DE FORCE established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside
through the first turn before taking to the two path down the backstretch, remained patiently handled just off the inside into the far turn, came under
intensifying pressure from the eventual winner and was placed to coaxing headed for command at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper
stretch and weakened. STREET TRUST three wide through the opening bend and down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, went three wide into upper stretch and tired. SHALAKO coaxed from the gate, raced just off the inside through the first turn
before tipping three to four wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path at the half mile pole, lost ground and was guided outside near the
three-eighths and placed to a protective hold, got eased along before being pulled up near the quarter pole and was subsequently vanned off.

SURE STITCH away without apparent mishap, assumed a forward position prior to departing the backstretch, was the outermost of a threesome to vie for
control, initially from the four path and then afterwards from the three path beginning at the midway point, struck the front as three-quarters was being
completed, responded when given its cue in the general area of the three-sixteenths marker, edged away under a strong drive late. DANCING KIKI racing
from along the outside, underwent a four wide pursuit on the turn, narrowed in as six furlongs was being reeled, swung into the lane and after settling in was
called upon for more, got staved off. MICROMILLION tracked the front runners from the pocket during the opening half, slipped into the two path at the top
of the turn, stayed in midpack, was moved to the outside for the drive home until eventually about five wide, went on to secure the show with a mild
response. I'M FINE took up the chase two to three wide on the turn, was fanned out into path six during the stretch run, rallied mildly for the last significant
slice of the purse. WEAR MY RING proceeded along sluggishly on the backstretch after stumbling at the start, was three to four wide bringing up the back of
the pack on the turn, got maneuvered to the outside entering the stretch, until about four to five wide, seemed to mostly improve position. KILKEA raced
three wide from between rivals on the turn, commenced the stretch slightly wide, lacked a response. HAVIN' A PARTY cut over to the rail after the field had
been released, argued for control until the seven-sixteenths pole then backed away. BELLA DOMENICA disputed the pace from path two for a little more
than a half, slid over to the rail coming up the midway point on the turn, continued to try to hold off a twosome to the outside, got headed as the third fraction
was being completed, stayed prominent for a little while longer and tired. GOOSARELLA stepped onto the turn from the three path, was between rivals
contending for the top, followed BELLA DOMENICA and moved closer to the rail midway on the turn, fought onward to upper stretch and gave way.
GRINGOTTS quickly spotted along the rail, rode it for the nearly three-quarters, tipped into the two path at the head of the stretch, was never heard from.

PRAIRIE FIRE vied inside a pair from the two path down the backstretch, tucked to the inside and was headed for command into the turn, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced once more to vie inside that same pair taking back the front just before cutting the corner into upper stretch, dug
in under a drive inching away to the eighth pole, held well to the finish to prevail. COLLEGEVILLE GIRL chased just off the inside from just off the pace,
tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing three furlongs out, cut the corner into upper stretch in behind the aforementioned foe, rallied up
the rail with a mild kick to secure the place honors in the final jump. QUIETUDE broke in at the start bumping and squeezing back ELLA'S SONG in tandem
with SARATOGA STYLE who came outwards due to pressure from OVERTIME OLIVIA, before losing her lane to EYE'S ON YOU, who broke inwards,
chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn coming under coaxing midway, swung four to five wide into
upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. TAYLER'S THE BOSS coaxed from the gate, chased four to five wide under coaxing from three furlongs out,
continued four to five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the last major share. TODAY COMES ONCE two to three wide in pursuit from mid
pack, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and improved position in the drive. EYE'S ON YOU broke in at the start
taking over the lane of QUIETUDE, vied four then three wide outside a pair down the backstretch and through the turn placed to coaxing three furlongs from
home, swung three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. MY LAST MILLION chased four to five wide down the backstretch and then three
wide through the turn coming under a ride at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. WAILIN JOSIE chased
four to five wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, cornered five wide for home, weakened in the stretch. ELLA'S SONG broke in a step bumping
SARATOGA STYLE and then got squeezed back and forced to steady due to pressure from OVERTIME OLIVIA breaking outwards, raced seven paths off
the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn, went six wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. OVERTIME OLIVIA broke out at
the start bumping OVERTIME OLIVIA and causing half the pressure that squeezed back ELLA'S SONG, vied between rivals three then two wide taking over
narrow and brief command at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened. SARATOGA
STYLE got bumped between foes at the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the half mile pole, got put to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun
just off the inside at the head of the stretch and trailed.

MORE MISCHIEF attained a forward position after the start, departed the backstretch from the three path, moved to the front as three-quarters was being
completed, got cued up turning into the lane, took charge during the ensuing furlong then extended the winning margin the rest of the way home. MARY'S
GIRL took up position in midack on the backstretch, was approximately three wide in pursuit of the front runners on the turn, swung into the lane and took off
in earnest, proved no match. UNBRIDLEDADVENTURE away last, chased the pace from path four on the turn, was set down right around the
five-sixteenths pole, shifted into the five path during the stretch run, made no impact. ELEGANT ZIP stalked the pace towards the two path, gained an
abbreviated lead late on the bend once SHE TAKES CHARGE lost her best action, was put to a drive heading home, failed to keep pace with the winner's
burst of speed, then backed away steadily. VIRADIA raced along the inside route for nearly three-quarters, angled four wide into the lane, had no offering
and tired. CATHY NAZ sent over to the rail midpoint on the backstretch, failed to pick up when asked for more at the three-eighths pole, tipped out three
wide for the drive, retreated. SHE TAKES CHARGE rushed up early on the chute to establish the top, showed the way from along the inside route, felt
pressure from a pair of opponents to the outside after finishing off the half, fell back when becoming choppy-gaited in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole,
got eased down the lane, then after making it across the finish line, walked off the track.

Footnotes
FUTURE BOOK off to an alert beginning, wasted no time establishing control, moved onto the inside route, was lightly hand urged showing the way, drew
off from the second place finisher during the run around the bend, got turned loose spinning into the lane, left the eighth pole still in possession of a healthy
lead, saw the second place finisher cut into it readily in the final sixteenth but held sway. KILMARKNOCK assumed the role of primary after undergoing
some light contact with WESWORLD in the shadow of the starting gate, was being hand urged chasing the winner on the turn while stationed in path two,
came into the stretch, made good headway in the final sixteenth en route for the place. WESWORLD bumped lightly with the runner up right after the field
had been sent off and running, travelled three wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, went on to secure the show. BRONZE
LION out-hustled for the top, chased the pace from path two, was switched over to stronger handling after crossing the midway point on the turn, went into
the lane and gave way. CATZALIONBYTHETALE four wide entering the turn, was sent out into path five exiting it, had no offering. OUR PAPA G quickly
spotted along the inside route, saved ground to no avail. FALSE ALARM remained along the rail after the start, didn't respond when asked for more on the
turn and faltered.
