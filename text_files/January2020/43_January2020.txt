CATTY KRYS just off leaders challenged at half to battle to the wire all out. WAR EAGLE'S LOVE pressed leaders, dueled to the stretch, battled back
slowly. SOUR PEACH raced evenly, with no late response in the stretch run. FASHION ENVY no speed to the half, steady advance to the stretch, evened
out. SHEESA PONTIAC dueled on the lead to the half, could not keep up, faded late. BOURBON GIRL hopped at the start, never far back to the half, gave
way readily. MALEFICENT QUEEN turned in a dull effort with late response. MAJESTIC BOLD dueled to the half, gave way readily.

leaders four wide and cleared the field in the final stages. NO INTEREST stalked the pace early, shifted into the three path in the far turn, led the field into
the lane, inched ahead down the lane but faltered late in the drive. VORTICES chased the pace early, shifted into the three path in the far turn, made a bid
in the stretch but hung in the late stages. BLUEBERRY SHINE chased the pace early, shifted into the three path in the far turn and moved up in the stretch
run. SPEARETTE was unhurried early on, shifted into the four path in the far turn and improved position. SAGARA was back early on, raced off the rail into
the lane, made a bid in the stretch but was empty late in the drive. MUSABAQA tracked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane while making a bid but
faded late in the stretch drive. MARIA ROSE was never a threat. LADY LEAH set the pace for a half then folded up.
