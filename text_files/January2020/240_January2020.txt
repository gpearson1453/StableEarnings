Footnotes
ARRIVAL broke a step slow, raced unhurried for five furlongs, began to advance far turn, angled out to be five wide into the lane, bid past the furlong marker
while drifting slightly, finished with good energy to be edging clear late. MOMENT prompted the pace from the outside and three wide first turn, moved to
challenge midway on the final turn, dueled into the lane, showed the way past the furlong marker between foes, proved no match for the winner late inside
that rival, clearly second best. FRONT DOOR settled off the pace and the inside, moved out to be widest into the lane, lodged a brief bid nearing the furlong
marker then flattened out in the run to the wire. GOOD GOOD lacked early foot inside, crept closer along the rail late in the final turn, failed to sustain that
advance in the drive to finish up willingly. HINTON narrowly set the early pace off the inside, dropped to the inside for the final turn, gave way when headed
in upper stretch. CHICORY BLUE void of early foot, raced three wide final turn, faltered in the drive. DIVINE HOLIDAY prompted the pace for four furlongs,
gave way. ON PATROL fell back to trail after the start, raced off the inside, showed little in trailing throughout.

Footnotes
WILLOW MOON away well, soon got clear, rated kindly into and through the turn, continued to maintain daylight into the lane, was not threatened the final
furlong while being kept to task. COUNTRY DREAM in the second flight early, advanced into the lane, advanced three wide to race closest to the winner
entering the stretch, could not match that one in the run to the wire, remained well clear of the rest. LANEYS LOVE void speed, raced off the pace four wide,
staged a mild rally to finish up best of the rest. DENA'S BOLD MOVE void of speed, four wide exiting the turn, improved position while remaining well out in
the strip. SAILAWAY AND HIDE broke back, moved up the opening furlong, steadied in some traffic soon after, fell back slightly, went one paced through
the lane in lacking a late response. ELUSIVE SECRET last away, trailed much of the way, picked off some tiring rivals with some belated interest. WILD
DEZ within striking distance early, had little left for the drive. PRIMARY PAULA stumbled at the start, recovered to be forwardly placed, chased winner
through the turn, gave way in the drive. BANKER NITA saved ground for a half, angled out turning for home, lacked closing kick. TAPIT RIGHT raced in mid
pack early, had little for the drive. RICH PRINCESS closest to the winner early, staged a steady retreat. DADDY'S ANGEL steadied at the start, remained
always back.

MIRACLE MARCH broke well, prompted the leader from the outside while in hand, took over turning for home, dueled the next furlong then kicked well clear
in the late going while under pressure. HYNDFORD took command into the first turn inside, set the pace while rating, briefly responded when the winner
challenged exiting the final turn, could not match that one the final furlong, weakened to lose the place late. WILD ABOUT YOU in the second ground while
along the inside, continued to save ground through the final turn, moved out a bit for the drive, finished with late interest to narrowly miss the place.
GOSPEL ABE in the second flight outside, came three wide into the lane, set down, managed little in the way of any late gain. STUART HALL raced off the
early pace, came into the stretch while between rivals, came up empty for the drive. GRAY PHANTOM settled off the pace and the inside, came four wide
into the lane, lacked a closing response;. SHAKEDOWN lacked speed while between horses, continued to race in some traffic into the lane, had nothing for
the stretch run. SWITHERAL last to leave, trailed early, never a menace. ANDREW THE GIANT was finished early, far back.

Footnotes
VILLAINOUS settled off the pace and the inside, continued outside when advancing second turn, bid while drifting out past midstretch, lugged in late when
clear, driving finish. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF HUNT THE FRONT FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH,,
THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND. HUNT THE FRONT tucked inside early to save some ground, moved closer while continuing inside into the far
turn, brief wait approaching midway on that bend. got through, was left with too much to do with the winner late, up in the final strides to earn the place.
KENTUCKY SUMMER settled off the pace, raced in some traffic in the far turn, continued to race between rivals afterward, clear for the drive on the outside,
along for the show late. FRONT MAN away in good order, set the pace while under restraint toward the inside, continued to show the way into the lane,
faltered late while drifting out slightly, continued to give way late to lose a couple of positions. CATHOLIC GUILT closest to the leader, lodged a brief bid
outside that one far turn, gave way in the drive. FULL AUTHORITY settled in mid pack well off the inside, came four wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick.
OCTOBER SURPRISE made little impact while off the inside. RIP IT RYAN broke back was never a factor. STOCK DEAL tired while racing very wide.

Footnotes
LEWYS VAPORIZER broke alertly, soon sprinted early, reserved while garnering a larger advantage through the turn, maintained a comfortable advantage
through the lane under token encouragement to win ridden out. PLUMBAGO shuffled back just after the start, saved some ground into the turn, angled out
in some traffic late bend, dropped back to the rail for the drive and finished up willingly while not a threat to the winner. WEAST HILL lacked speed, came six
wide out of the turn when advancing, mild rally, no match for the top two. AIR POWER broke back, four wide into the lane, also staged a mild rally to
improve his position. CHIEF OF STAFF off the pace while well out in the track up the backstretch, continued five wide through the turn, had little left for the
drive. RED CLAY MAGIC in the main group off the inside, in some traffic turning for home, came up empty for the stretch run. FLIGHT TIME (BRZ)
forwardly placed in the early going, began a steady fade after a quarter. GIANT PULPIT broke back, lacked speed, came six wide into the lane, passed
tiring rivals while never a threat. GIDDYMEISTER tired from early efforts. DAPPER JACK in the main bodly early along the inside, gave way. EVADER tired
while four wide most of the way. RAVENS REFLECTION chased the winner early and stopped while off the inside.

READY TO ROLL moved up inside soon after the start to narrowly show the way into the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch, kicked
clear in the drive while drifting slightly. INSTIGATED with the early pace, pressured the winner from the outside the middle half, could not keep up with that
one through the stretch, drifted, saved the jplace. AHSAD settled off the pace while inside, continued to saved ground into the lane, staged a mild amount of
late interest to be along for the show to prove best of the rest. LIDO LEGACY forwardly placed and four wide through the first turn, continued outside while
remaining within striking distance in the run up the backstretch, came up empty when weakening in the drive to lose the show. TIZ THE JOURNEY last
away, raced back, passed tiring rivals while never a threat. DESCENT pressed the issue early in the three path through the first turn, faded. F F ROCKET
was never a threat. SELLECK also remained always back. TOUGH COMPANY was finished before a half.

Footnotes
SILVER RIDE broke well, allowed the speed to go early while saving ground, tilted out three wide exiting the turn, was set down for the drive and finished
full of run to win going away in a sharp effort. NERO with the pace from the start inside, dueled late in the turn, briefly responded when the winner came
alongside past the furlong marker, could not match that one late, held sway for the place. GORDY FLORIDA vied early three wide and between rivals,
dueled late in the turn and into the lane, gave way from between the top two the final furlong. BATTLE STATION lacked early foot, set down in the two path
entering the stretch, angled out late in displayed some mild, belated interest. MOJO MAN lacked early foot, improved position slightly without posing a
serious threat. AWESOME ANYWHERE within striking distance early, four wide through the turn while remaining forward, came up empty for the drive.
PETROV went one paced throughout while racing three out to four wide through the turn. HORSE GREEDY off the pace while four wide, also lacked a
closing response. GRAY ATTEMPT contested the pace while racing three wide, gave way late in the turn. SPIKES SHIRL last to leave, trailed throughout in
showing little.

Footnotes
GOLD STREET broke on top, cleared toward the inside into the first turn, set the pace in hand the middle four furlongs, roused into the lane, shook clear
and was kept to task with brisk right handed urging late. THREE TECHNIQUE last away, advanced to within striking distance while off the inside, moved
closer three wide late in the second turn, briefly challenged the winner from the outside then could not keep up in the drive, clearly second best.
SHOPLIFTED forwardly placed, also crept closer to the winner while in the two path turning for home, failed to sustain that advance in the drive, remained
clear of the other. SILVER PROSPECTOR broke out then lacked speed, continued to lack speed, asked along while saving ground into the lane, steered
out, some mild interest to improve position. LYNN'S MAP prompted the pace while off the inside, three wide into the far turn, remained within striking
distance far turn, had little left for the drive. SHARED SENSE bothered slightly at the start, raced back and off the inside, failed to muster a significant rally
when called on for the drive. LYKAN rank early along the rail into the first turn, checked up soon after, recovered and made little impact. JUNGLE RUNNER
firm restraint while outside early, mid pack, gave way in the drive. NUCKY in mid pack early, backed up in the drive.

Footnotes
RING LEADER broke sharp, set the pace toward the inside, roused into the lane, remained well clear. RAGGEDY ANNIE lacked early foot, circled five wide
when advancing late in the turn, continued with good energy to the finish while not a threat to the winner. ELITE SONG forwardly placed while along the
inside, set down drive, lacked serious kick, finished up best of rest. COMPELLING SMILE back and toward the inside, steered out five wide turning for
home, late interest down the middle of the track to improve. BLACK KAT TAPS off slowly, 2p, moved out off the inside, three wide early in the turn, moved
out four wide exiting the bend, displayed some mild interest while also well out in the strip. KISS THE GIRL broke well, raced in the second flight four wide
through the turn, little left for the stretch run. COMPETITIVE FIRE went evenly while racing in the three path. CHEROKEE CHATTER broke with the field,
made little impact while racing in the two path. COWGIRL KIMMIE in the main body early off the inside, fanned seven wide into the lane, failed to muster a
rally. MOORAC forwardly placed, moved closest to the winner in the turn, faltered in the drive while off the inside. FLAT PRECIOUS pressed the winner
early, steadily faded. PRETORIA 4w turn, gave way.
