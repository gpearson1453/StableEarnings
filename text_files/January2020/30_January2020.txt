Footnotes
BLANKET OF ROSES advanced four wide around the far turn, battled outside MONTANA MAN through midstretch, came out late under heavy left-hand
pressure and prevailed after a hard drive. MONTANA MAN was eased back off the leaders three wide after a sharp opening quarter-mile, bid between
horses still in the three-path turning for home, battled gamely inside the winner and yielded in the closing yards. TOLKIEN steadied back to last after the
start and was far back for a half-mile, arrived on the scene angling to the far outside at the top of the stretch, reached the leaders from outside while lugging
in and checking off BLANKET OF ROSES very tough to handle past the 70-yard marker, then bore out sharply coming to the wire. COSMIC TREASURE
broke out bumping FORTYEIGHTSTRAIGHT at the start, then bumped with that one again shortly after, saved ground to the far turn, slid out to the
three-path in upper stretch, and finished evenly. NINETYDAYSOFWINTER was squeezed back between horses at the start, raced well back for six furlongs,
and improved mildly without threatening. FIRST RATE saved ground on the turns, and could not reach contention. FORTYEIGHTSTRAIGHT got bumped by
COSMIC TREASURE at the start and wandered out tightening up rivals, wandered back in and bumped with COSMIC TREASURE again several strides
later, vied through a quick early tempo before deferring to PLAN OF ATTACK, and weakened after six furlongs. PLAN OF ATTACK went up four wide keen
on getting the lead leaving the first turn, cleared off and moved inward setting fast middle splits, and faltered inside leaving the far turn. THERE WAS A
GENERAL STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE AGAIN was forwardly placed and tracked the leader through early stages, commenced a steady bid around the turn, turned for home three
wide under pressure, advanced to gain a narrow lead past the furlong marker, continued with the advantage under firm handling and held safe. NUESTRA
UNION bobbled slightly at the start and raced off the top trio, gained ground on the leaders midway through the backstretch then came under a ride entering
the turn, moved into the lane four wide and stayed on with response, gained striking distance on the winner but could not get by. TIME TO TWO STEP was
off slow then drifted inside at the start, raced in the back near the inside then switched to the outside near the half mile marker, roused through the turn and
raced five wide entering top stretch, advanced into contention then steadily edged up closer and prevailed for a share. LUXE DIAMOND bobbled slightly at
the start then raced in close contention through the backstretch, continued a bid along the inside entering top stretch, switched out a couple paths past the
furlong marker then flattened out. IMPRESSION GIVEN sped to the lead and angled in to race two wide on top through the backstretch, remained the firm
leader around the turn, raced under pressure with rivals closing in at head of the lane, dug in for more then got collared by winner past the furlong marker
and gave way. ARCHING was stubborn to load, dropped back in early going and was not persevered with in late stages.

Footnotes
SEVEN GEMS pressed the pace outside STURGEON, rallied determinedly through the stretch and wore down that rival late. STURGEON cleared to the
lead and moved inside approaching the turn, dug in through the furlong grounds but could not hold off the top one in deep stretch. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR
raced two wide around the turn, and finished evenly. INTIMIDATION was outsprinted three wide to the quarter-pole, moved to the far outside for the drive
and gained only mildly. DIZZY SIGHT had the two-path most of the way, and could not reach contention. ISLAND TAP hustled up after the start, steadied
along the rail behind the pacesetter heading into the turn, and dropped back. HURRICANE HILL moved up around the turn three wide, and came up empty
in the stretch.

Footnotes
DOMINEER tracked the top two leaders through early stages, hustled up and raced three wide near the quarter pole, advanced to race in aim for the lead in
the stretch run, continued to inch up closer on HONEST GAL under firm handling, reached equal terms for the lead late stretch and got a nose up in time.
HONEST GAL advanced up the inside to challenge SWEETONTHEGENTS in early stages, continued to duel for the lead around the turn, shook free
turning for home, fought back determinedly when DOMINEER began to edge up closer in final furlong, rival advanced to race on equal terms late stretch,
dug in gamely but then nipped on the wire. STRONG PERFORMANCE was off a step awkward at the start, hustled up out of the gate but lacked early
speed and raced in the back, continued in the rear around the turn then raced wide under a ride entering top stretch, stayed outside under steady urging
and churned on for share. SWEETONTHEGENTS held a slim lead out of the gate then vied for the lead racing outside of HONEST GAL, continued to battle
for the lead around the turn, could not match strides with rival at the head of the lane, kept along to the furlong marker then gave way. I'M
PRAYINGFORTHAT raced five wide and hustled along five wide moving through the backstretch, kept under a ride around the turn, entered top stretch two
wide then came out wider and lacked the needed response for impact. TRINNI SUNSHINE raced off the early speed and saved ground through early
stages, continued to stay inside around the turn, kept under a ride in stretch run but failed to produce a threatening bid. MUSIC CITY WOLF raced in range
and chased off the second flight at the half mile marker, failed to advance under pressure around the turn then weakened in the lane. ABOVE PAR raced in
contention and chased the top pair through early stages, response flattened around the turn then faded in the lane.

Footnotes
MONFORTE quickly gained command, established a fast pace with the field strung out behind him, settled into the stretch well in command and was never
in jeopardy while kept to pressure. KEEPSAKEKITTEN broke out bumping VINTAGE KITTEN, then was mashed between that one and MR. WHO a
moment later, raced far back coming under the whip approaching the far turn, moved out in the stretch with a belated response, and went clear for second
late. VINTAGE KITTEN was sandwiched at the start between KEEPSAKEKITTEN and SAINT BENEVOLENCE, trailed far back early, remained well out of it
moving to the far outside entering the stretch, and rallied mildly. BLAZING DESIRE broke out at the start but avoided the mayhem to his outside, raced
outside VERDICT IS IN as they chased after the pacesetter together, and weakened in deep stretch. SAINT BENEVOLENCE got bumped by VINTAGE
KITTEN and pushed out at the start, stayed in the early picture two wide, moved inside falling farther behind through the middle stages, and lacked a late
response. VERDICT IS IN saved ground racing as a team inside BLAZING DESIRE to the stretch, and likewise tired from his early efforts in the last
sixteenth of a mile. QUICK ENOUGH had a rail trip and was never close. MR. WHO broke out bumping solidly with KEEPSAKEKITTEN at the start, and
was outrun throughout.

SHIVAREE hustled up out of the gate and gained a contending position along the inside, chased the top flight through early stages then shifted out and
remained in steady pursuit off top trio around the turn, raced wide entering top stretch, gathered momentum under firm handling and kicked clear in the final
sixteenth. RICKI TICKI TAFFI was positioned along the outside of SHIVAREE while in pursuit for the top flight in early stages, prompted and advanced to
vie three wide for the lead approaching the quarter pole, drifted out wider turning for home, dug in holding a narrow advantage then got outkicked by
SHIVAREE in final sixteenth. PERUVIAN BOY raced along the outside off the early pace, roused through the turn then kept under a ride entering top
stretch, shifted out wider and kept on with response and cleared share. CAJUN CASANOVA briefly held the lead out of the gate then conceded position to
ZAINO BOYZ, remained forwardly placed chasing a quick pace then vied for the lead racing between foes nearing the quarter pole, continued to battle back
with a furlong left to run then came up tired and faded. UNCAPTURED KING lacked early foot and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn then
shifted out to raced widest at head of the lane and lacked a needed rally. ZAINO BOYZ hustled up out of the gate and advanced to take the early lead, set a
quick pace then challenged and vied for the lead at the quarter pole, kept on at the head of the lane then had nothing left in late reserve and dropped back.

Footnotes
ISLAND COMMISH prompted the early pace outside GET SMOKIN, challenged for command at the top of the stretch, reached even terms past the
eighth-pole and edged away. GET SMOKIN broke to the lead, rated along saving ground on the turns, dug in when confronted by ISLAND COMMISH and
held well. SUMMER TO REMEMBER tracked outside the leaders three wide from the outset, came under a ride approaching the quarter-pole, and could not
gain with an even finish. IRISH MIAS bumped lightly with YESTERDAYONCEMORE at the start, lagged well back early inside, came four wide leaving the
far turn and gained minimally. KING THEO tucked in behind the leaders on the first turn, was put to a drive on the rail around the far turn, but lacked the
needed response. MYSTIC LANCELOT advanced a bit three wide after a half-mile, but could not sustain the rally and gave way. YESTERDAYONCEMORE
(IRE) bumped lightly with IRISH MIAS at the start, and was outrun throughout. BLESS THE KITTEN took the first turn three wide near the rear, and showed
little.

Footnotes
SOUND MACHINE was off to a good start and angled in a few paths from the outside, was forwardly placed and settled nicely racing just off the leader,
tapped on the shoulder and advanced to match strides for the lead with SAYONARA BABY near the quarter pole, cleared on top turning for home then
stayed sharp under steady pressure and finished going away. SAYONARA BABY sped to the lead and angled in to race two wide and lead the way in
opening stages, remained the leader entering the turn then challenged by SOUND MACHINE near the quarter pole, could not move on with rival but stayed
on with response along the rail for the runner up spot. SPANISH POINT raced in range through early stages and raced three deep going by the half mile
marker, commenced a steady bid through the turn, entered top stretch three wide, remained in steady pursuit and prevailed for a share. LAVI raced off the
early pace then showed more and circled up closer racing five wide at the quarter pole, fanned out wider entering top stretch then continued a steady
outside bid for a mild improve. TALE OF SUCCESS was off a step slow at the start, chased after the early pace then advanced position racing four wide
around the turn, came out wider for the drive and raced evenly through late stages. LADY ANNA tracked the top two leaders along the rail, stayed inside
and came under a ride moving through the turn, cut the corner and kept on with interest then weakened in late stages. GLORY DIA raced in contention and
tracked the top two early leaders, continued to track racing between foes going by the half mile marker, prompted for response two wide through the turn
then weakened in the lane. ADDILYN raced in the back and took the inside position late backstretch, angled out and prompted then switched back in a
couple paths, raced behind foes upper stretch, steadied slightly and failed to rally.

Footnotes
SHE'S MY TYPE (FR) became unsettled tossing her head under restraint on the first turn, settled down through the run up the backstretch, advanced swiftly
to contention four wide past the quarter-pole, caught HEAR MY PRAYER into the final furlong and drew clear late, then had enough to hold on. MORAL
REASONING steadied along lightly through the first turn inside, maneuvered out to the four-path approaching the stretch, rallied steadily outside and was
getting to the winner in the final yards. ABSCOND stumbled at the start, settled in the middle of the field two wide to the far turn, waited for room behind the
leaders at the top of the lane, moved out a bit rallying between BREDENBURY and MORAL REASONING into the last sixteenth of a mile, and closed
willingly. SUNSET PROMISE bumped twice with QUEEN OF GOD at the start and was steered away to the rail right after that, lagged well back in the
two-path on the far turn before angling out a bit, moved farther out in midstretch and was going well late. BREDENBURY (IRE) tracked the leaders three
wide, was urged outside issuing a bid coming off the far turn, fought on to the furlong grounds and gave way. HEAR MY PRAYER sprinted clear in the
two-path heading to the first turn, moved in setting a solid pace for better than six furlongs, and was overrun through the closing stages. RUNWAY
DREAMER cut over to the rail heading to the first turn, saved ground to the lane well back, and made no impact. QUEEN OF GOD bobbled after being
bounced around between SUNSET PROMISE and HIGH ON GIN at the start, raced at the rear to the stretch and gained mildly in the second flight.
AMERICAN GIANT prompted the pace outside HEAR MY PRAYER, bid between horses into the far turn, but faded in the stretch. CHEERMEISTER broke
through the gate prior to the start, was outsprinted to the top early, stayed close for a half-mile and gave way. HIGH ON GIN bumped with QUEEN OF GOD
at the start, took the first turn four wide, stayed well out in the course with a mild advance after a half-mile, but retreated soon after that.

CHANCE IT bumped with foe at the start the took the inside position and rated off the clear leader while racing in range of the second flight, continued in
hand and advanced up the inside leaving the five sixteenths pole, matched AS SEEN ON TV for the lead turning for home, battled back gamely from the
inside position through the lane, rival held a slight edge at the furlong marker but kept on tenaciously, put a nose in front nearing the wire and refused to give
in. AS SEEN ON TV raced in tracking mode off the clear leader in early stages, continued racing in the path outside of CHANCE It going by the half mile
marker, roused forward three wide leaving the five sixteenths pole and began to match strides with CHANCE IT, battled back along the outside of rival and
held a head in front at the furlong marker, kept on gamely with sharp response, refused to give up but got edged out in final strides. SOLE VOLANTE was
unhurried and raced six to five wide down the backstretch, picked up the tempo leaving the backstretch, switched out wider midway through the turn, raced
five wide under steady pressure in the final furlong, stayed on with response and cleared the rest. SOUTH BEND was reserved racing in the back and saved
ground through early stages, angled out and put to a drive four to five wide upper stretch and improved position without threatening. INTER MIAMI rated off
the clear early leader while positioned in range of the second flight, launched a four wide bid around the turn and kept under a ride into stretch but had no
late kick. SMASH FACTOR cleared on top shortly after the start and remained the clear leader down the backstretch, got collared for the lead midway
through the turn then had nothing left in late reserve. ASHAAR rated under slight restraint in early going, hustled up four to five wide around the turn then
kept under steady pressure into the lane then offered no late rally. Race was hand timed due to timer malfunction, THE TRAINER OF #4 AS SEEN ON TV

Footnotes
ICE TEA tucked in saving ground just off the early leaders, found room on the rail challenging innermost of four across the course into the stretch, edged
away 70 yards out, then just held off MUSTAAQEEM in the final strides. MUSTAAQEEM (AUS) tugged his way along early inside, settled down through the
backstretch run, followed behind ICE TEA around the far turn and into the stretch, tipped out to the four-path near the sixteenth-pole and surged outside to
just miss. PROLIFERATE prompted the pace outside PREAMBLE, bid between that one and KRAMPUS turning for home, fought on to deep stretch but
was outkicked to the wire. KRAMPUS was never far back, ranged up three then four wide to loom a threat outside the leaders approaching the stretch, but
weakened through the last eighth of a mile. LEMONIST lagged well back to the far turn moving out two then three wide, went farther out for the drive and
improved without threatening. STIRLING DRIVE raced in the three-path a good part of the way, advanced a bit in the four-path late on the far turn, then
flattened out. PREAMBLE set the pace slightly removed from the rail, came under attack from both flanks into the lane, and yielded through the furlong
grounds. EPIC BROMANCE raced three wide early, and lacked the needed response. PRINCE OF ARABIA saved ground early, moved out three wide on
the far turn, and remained at the back.
