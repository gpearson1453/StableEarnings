Footnotes
SUGAR STREAK raced off the pace inside, moved up on the backside, came out bothering OUR CLAIRE BEAR nearing the far turn, took over, drew off
and was ridden out. TIZ A DATE raced off the pace inside, advanced on the far turn, rallied and dug in to hold second. TIZ A SHARPIE stalked three wide,
went three wide on the far turn, rallied mildly and was outfinished for second. ASHLEY'S HOPE was outrun early, advanced on the far turn and failed to
threaten. TIZ A TRIBUTE chased between rivals, steadied entering the far turn and faded. LADY WARBUCKS raced four wide early, made a strong move
on the first turn to contest the pace, opened up on the backside, then gave way on the far turn. OUR CLAIRE BEAR set the early pace, then tracked, was
bothered by SUGAR STREAK nearing the far turn, causing her to stumbled and lose the rider. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the incident, SUGAR STREAK
was disqualified and placed last.

Footnotes
MANIPULATE stalked from the inside, took the lead in deep stretch and slowly inched away. MY DANZIG PARTNER set the early pace in four and five
paths, resisted gamely when challenged and gave way grudgingly. DR VUNNO saved ground to the turn, split foes then angled out into stretch but flattened
out. HOPE DRIVE, just off the rail and never far back, tired. JOE THE BOSS broke slowly, raced well off the rail and showed little. BRILLIANT WORTH,
wide and just off the pace, tired. WEST FORK, fractious prestart, raced outside winner early then tired. CAECILIUS steered wide after the start, dropped far
back.

on late, driving. FRATELLO DEL NORD chased close up inside, bid on the rail entering the turn, dropped back, angled out past midstretch and came again
late. HE'S GOT TALENT chased between rivals, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly. IRONBOUND chased four wide, raced three wide on the

wide, four wide on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
HELOTES, between second flight, quickly took the lead entering stretch, opened a clear lead with a furlong to run and continued to edge away under a
drive. CREEDIBILITY, bumped at the start, was jostled on the backstretch and steered to the rail, rail, moved out for the stretch run and was 2nd best.
LIGHTS DOWN LOW saved ground just off the pace, split rivals in stretch then faded. RUNNIN ON SUNSHINE set the pace just off the rail and then gave
way. BLISSFUL BREEZE saved ground, was set down leaving the turn but was much too late to be a serious threat. RISQUE EXPRESS lunged leaving the
gate, raced wide and tired. LA PURISSIMA came out leaving the gate bumping CREEDIBILITY into TRUE UP[GRADE,, raced wide and failed to menace.
TRUE UPGRADE, bumped leaving the gate, was in tight on the backstretch and failed to menace. BOBBY'S SONG, three wide in second flight, had little
left. WITH SEVERAL HORSES BEING DIFFICULT TO LOAD, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DELAY IN POST TIME.

Footnotes
MESS'N AROUND, four wide, challenged on the turn, was fanned wider racing into stretch, fell back slightly mid stretch but closed determinedly and was
just up. DOCTORSOFMISCHIEF set the pace just off rail, drifted out a bit entering stretch, edged away near mid stretch and just failed to last.
GETOUTTAMYWAY saved ground just off pace, lacked a strong closing kick. FILLUPCOHENSAPIKER hesitated leaving the gate then raced wide.
DECOUPAGE, inside winner early, raced between foes into stretch, angled in and faded. SAINT MAIN EVENT stumbled leaving the gate, raced in the four
path and was no threat.
