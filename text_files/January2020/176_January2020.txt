Footnotes
EL DISCRETO came through the opening turn in the three path then started a bid toward the five sixteenths pole, steadily improved in the five path of the
far turn then dug in from the top of the stretch to get up the final strides. GOODBYESEEULATER loaded reluctantly then hustled to the lead nearing the
three quarter pole and set the pace, came under pressure from the five sixteenths, was steadily encouraged through the lane then caught the final strides.
THE SON WIND saved ground well off the pace the first turn, eased out with a bid past the half mile pole, entered the far turn in the four path, was carried to
the six path approaching the top of the stretch and came along for third inside the sixteenth pole. KINGDOM MINDED raced in the four path the first turn
then bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail, drifted a bit leaving the turn and showed little more. JONATHAN MCD saved
ground off the early pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, angled to the five path on the far turn then flattened stride. POET WARRIOR stalked the early
pace three wide then gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail but weakened leaving the eighth pole. CAUSE FOR
SURPRISE stalked the pace inside, gave chase from the three eighths pole then weakened on the far turn.

Footnotes
SWEETIN BREAD stalked the pace from the three path then bid leaving the three eighths pole, took the nod three wide midway on the far turn, lugged
inward while being urged left handed then drew clear later yards. SONDE ST BLUES took the lead two deep at the nine sixteenths pole and rated the pace,
came under pressure past the three eighths and contested the edge through the backstretch, gave up the nod midway on the far turn, continued at even
terms through the upper stretch but dropped back mid-stretch then steadied at the rail later yards. BARN YARD BRAT raced with the pace then challenged
from the three eighths pole, contested close at the rail through the upper stretch then steadied a sixteenth away, angled out from that point but flattened
stride. JEN'S ORPHAN settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, drifted leaving
the turn and showed little more. LUFT SONGS saved ground off the pace then bid leaving the three eighths pole, eased out nearing the top of the lane but
showed little more. ELEANOR'S DIAMOND and BOOK ON ME were not factors. The stewards reviewed claims of foul against the riders of Sonde St Blues
and Sweetin Bread, lodged by the rider of Barn Yard Brat for alleged stretch interference, though, made no change. The stewards also reviewed a claim of
foul against the rider of Sweetin Bread, lodged by the rider of Sonde St Blues, for alleged stretch interference, and made no change.

and held on well. WINDSORS FOR IT settled off the pace through the backstretch then bid nearing the quarter pole, drifted to the five path on the turn then
lugged in to make contact with Poplar Avenue while dueling for second later yards. ROCK ON exchanged contact with Wills Defence leaving the gate then
picked up the chase, rounded the turn in the four path then outfinished for second later yards. POPLAR AVENUE chased the pace inside, drifted out to
make contact with Windsors For It later yards then flattened stride. WIZARD OF ODDS chased the pace, rounded the turn about the five path and finished
evenly. BEST SHOT contested the pace through the backstretch and raced at even terms nearest the rail through the turn, but dropped back mid-stretch
and weakened the final sixteenth. WILLS DEFENCE exchanged contact with Rock On leaving the gate then angled out to give chase, rounded the turn in

LINE OF ROSES settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead three wide nearing the quarter pole, dueled with
the edge through the far turn, raced clear into the stretch and dug in under steady handling to hold on well. LUCY I'M HOME saved ground off the pace then
bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, dug in for second later yards but couldn't improve further. MYLADYCHARLOTTE
tapered in to stalk the pace two deep, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced close at the rail on the far turn but flattened out inside the sixteenth
pole. CAROLINA'S TREAT settled off the pace in the three path the first turn then bid nearing the three eighths pole, though, flattened stride leaving the far
turn. PLAY CHARADES raced in the six path the first turn and entered the backstretch outside, bid into the lane but could only improve her position.
PERSONAL SERVER saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole but showed little in the lane. DEEPLY DEVOTED showed little response
in the six path of the far turn. UNCANNY rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole then faded at the rail rounding the far
turn. BURNISHED BRIGHT was not a factor. DUCKY came away a step slow then steadied and never factored.

TOTALITARIO settled off the early pace in the three and four paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole, challenged and took the lead midway on the far turn,
dueled clear mid-stretch then widened later yards. BACOLI settled close inside then challenged from the three eighths pole, took the lead at the five
sixteenths pole to put Silver Castle away, but, picked up Totalitario midway on the far turn and gave way to that one in the upper stretch. ON THE LAM
settled off the pace in the three and four paths then bid past the three eighths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and had little left. CLASSY
CROSSING saved ground well off the pace then bid leaving the second turn, angled to the six path nearing the head of the lane and passed SILVER
CASTLE, who rated the pace inside and came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, gave up the lead at the five sixteenths then faded at the rail on
the far turn.

dug in under steady handling to hold on. SHE'S QUIET settled close inside the first turn then bid into, and raced at the rail through the far turn, dug in under
steady encouragement leaving the turn to finish a game second, but pulled up lame post race and was vanned off. FRIGID SISTER saved ground into the
first turn then eased outward through the turn and raced outside into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn
in the six path then dug in to take third later yards before flattening stride. CAMERON STREET rounded the first turn in the four path then bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, raced three wide on the far turn but flattened stride from mid-stretch. GOLD AND STRIKE raced with the pace two deep then
challenged nearing the five sixteenths pole and continued close through the far turn before weakening. ALL FLATTER steadied off the heels of Gold And
Strike past the five eighths pole then settled off the pace leaving the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced between horses on the

Footnotes
A. P. D'ORO raced in the five path the first turn and entered the backstretch outside then bid nearing the three eighths pole, circled horses in the six path of
the far turn then steadily improved to get up later yards. LITTLE BARI settled off the pace in the three path then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole to take
over toward the quarter, drew clear midway on the far turn but was caught flattening stride later yards and just lasted for second. CASTLEFINN raced well
off the pace then bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, came between horses mid-stretch, finished well at the rail and
just missed second. EXPLOITATION saved ground off the pace then bid nearing the three eighths pole, dueled close two deep rounding the far turn and
remained a factor to deep stretch before flattening stride. CHARITABLE GOLD raced well off the pace saving ground the first turn then eased outward into
the backstretch and bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn four wide but flattened out inside the sixteenth pole. HANDSOME LIL J J
saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then angled to the outside entering the stretch and passed
rivals. JOEY GOTCHA rounded the first turn in the four path then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and continued in range of the lead to
the middle of the far turn before weakening. BINN GOODE angled in to stalk the pace two deep and took the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole, but,
was caught approaching the quarter, raced at the rail on the far turn then weakened. JACKS CITY angled to the inside and rated the pace, was caught
approaching the seven sixteenths pole, gave chase through the backstretch then faded on the far turn. LIME HUT saved ground off the early pace then
gave chase from the three eighths pole, but weakened while losing ground on the far turn.
