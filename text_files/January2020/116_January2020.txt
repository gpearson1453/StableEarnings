RUNFORMEFREDDIELEE set a pressured pace to the turn, drew clear and extended his lead under steady urging. STRONGREACH was never far back,
went eight wide at the top of the stretch, found his best stride late and got up for place while no threat to the winner. TRUMP RIDE lagged early while racing
inside, shifted out for the drive and finished well to get up for show. AUTISM IS HERE pressed the pace to the turn, fell back, went evenly late and lost
position. HOLLY CAT stalked the pace, bid inside on the turn to threaten, came up empty late and fell back. LUAS BRIO was off a step slowly, had brief
speed only and did not threaten. RAGING SIDECAR angled out into the turn, swung wide and showed little.

Footnotes
VICTORY ICE broke slowly, trailed the field, angled out in the upper stretch, closed willingly and got up at the wire. SOMARA was unhurried early, shifted to
the outside, rallied on the turn, bid six wide to duel, had the lead late and was caught at the wire. HIT'N TIME vied to the final strides and was outfinished in
a game effort. WINDI'S MOMENT showed good early speed, fell back, split horses mid stretch to contend and was outfinished in a good effort. TWO
STEPS OF GLORY raced close to the pace inside, bid along the rail to contend and didn't have enough late. LOUISIANA HANNA dueled for the lead, raced
four wide to the turn, swung out a bit entering the stretch, dueled to deep stretch and was unable to sustain his bid.

CYPRUS AVENUE pressed the pace, assumed command into the turn, drew clear and held well under steady urging. MERITTRIS stalked the pace, rallied
on the turn, bid eight wide, lacked the needed late rally and finished second best. REGAL JAZZ was never far back, lacked a late response and settled for
show. WARTIME LADY lagged early, went nine wide at the top of the stretch and improved position in an even effort. TIZ LUCY stalked inside, fell back on
the turn, bid inside and came up empty. SHINE ON ME stumbled badly at the start and raced evenly. OF COURSE IT IS was hustled along to set the pace,
dropped back into the turn and steadily faded. FRITZIES FIREWATER lacked a response, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
UZTA HAVE MONEY settled off the pace, rallied on the turn to challenge for the lead, dueled to mid stretch and drew off under mild urging. GO YOUR
OWN WAY set the pace, responded when challenged on the turn to duel, faltered near the eighth pole and was no match for the winner. EYE OF THE
HUNTER went six wide on the first turn, was never far off the pace, bid eight wide and earned show while no threat to the top two. SILENT PARADISE
saved ground, angled out on the turn, bid seven wide and lacked the needed rally. MUCHO MAS GRANDE raced in the back and improved position in a
steady effort. PARLAY PONTI was outrun in a wide trip. BATTLE ZONE was through after a half. UTANDREAM was not urged in a wide trip. BECOME AN
INSIDER was not a factor. MISSING GROOM was through early.

Footnotes
KOOL KATE was sent to the front, set the pace and held well in a driving finish. SABURAI chased the pace while racing inside, went three wide entering the
stretch and got up for place while no match for the winner. UNIQUE FACTOR saved ground, bid along the rail on the turn, lacked the needed rally and
settled for show. PRIDE'S GOLD raced mid pack, bid inside on the turn, had little left for the drive and failed to menace. TWIRLING DEVON raced in the
back, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and offered a mild bid only. CHANCE TO SHINE raced mid pack in an even effort. NORTHWEST FACTOR
was through after a half. SENORADIABLO was not a factor. FIRST HUNTER failed to contend. KILLARNEY LASS distanced the field. CONVINCE
distanced the field.

Footnotes
DRAYMAGIC dueled inside to the turn, drew off for a clear lead and held safely under urging. PUT YOUR PANTS ON was never far back, bid willingly,
couldn't gain ground and finished second best. DELTA REWARD raced in the second flight, altered course at the top of the stretch, bid, didn't have enough
late and settled for show. JOHNNY RAY lagged early, swung wide leaving the turn and closed well. GIOPRESS vied three across to the turn, dropped back
and faded. PARTY FOR ONE advanced to the turn, bid off the rail and hung in the lane. IN CONTROL bumped after the start, raced mid pack in an even
effort and did not threaten. COZY BAR showed speed to the turn and gave way. Y O L O CAT bumped after the start and was not a factor. TYBEE ISLAND
was not a factor. VIDAKS BACK dueled between horses to the turn and gave way. MAC MCLOVIN broke slowly and was crowded at the start and failed to
contend.

Footnotes
ROCKET SHIP lunged at the start, bid between horses on the turn, was carried out into the stretch and drew off past the eighth pole under left handed
urging. ROAD ROMEO drew clear on the second turn, swung out entering the stretch, yielded past the eighth pole and was all out for place. MARICOPA
COUNTY pressed the pace and lacked the needed late response. REVENGE AGAIN vied to the second turn, fell back, came again inside and came up
empty late. IRISH CHARLIE failed to menace in an even effort. LUCKY GENERAL was never far back, lacked a bid and did not threaten. CHIEFTAIN'S
LAD passed a tiring rival. OHTANI raced in close outside, stopped on the turn and was not urged late.

Footnotes
OHIO (BRZ) was never far back, rallied on the turn, challenged into the stretch, inched away past the eighth pole, was under pressure late and held on
gamely. ARIZONA MOON was unhurried early, advanced to the second turn, closed willingly, gained late and was outfinished. RIVER BOYNE (IRE) was
never far back, closed steadily and got up for show while no threat to the top two. MR. JAGERMEISTER set the pace, drew off on the second turn for a
clear lead and yielded past the eighth pole to lose position. GATO GUAPO showed good early speed, fell back, bid inside and came up empty. CONCUR
lagged early, swung wide on the turn and offered a mild bid only. BEAT THE HEAT was slow early, swung wide entering the stretch and offered a mild bid to
improve position. PUBILIUS SYRUS raced close to the pace, bid inside on the turn, had nothing left and faded. HIGH SECURITY was not a factor. MORSE
CODE showed speed to the second turn, tired and stopped. BLUE DANCER pressed the pace to the second turn, tired and stopped.
