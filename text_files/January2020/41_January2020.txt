Footnotes
SINGANOTHERSONG broke readily to prompt the pace four wide in the opening stages, shook clear nearing the turn while angling nearer to the inside,
held sway to upper stretch and widened the advantage in the closing stages under firm right handed encouragement. FIERY OPAL, held up when
momentarily caught in a bit tight at the start, shifted off the inside tracking off the second flight and steadily gained position in the closing stages to split rivals
while securing the place honors. SILVER DEFENSE broke sharply, raced on terns with the first flight in the opening furlong, was eased off the leaders while
shifting out in the second furlong, was prompted to advance three wide on the turn to briefly loom outside the winner nearing the quarter pole but flattened
out in upper stretch. EPIC DRAMA, urged between rivals prompting the pace in the opening stages, shifted to the inside racing into the turn and faded in the
closing stages. AMERICANO was settled outside foes early and proved no factor. BACK PAGE, urged to prompt the pace inside rivals in the opening
stages, emptied out early then drifted wide into the stretch.

Footnotes
RACHIELY'S DREAM, caught four wide racing to the first turn, settled last into the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide racing into the far turn to
wrest the advantage nearing upper stretch, shifted to the inside while gaining a clear advantage in the lane and just held MAIDU to the end under some left
handed pressure. The latter, unhurried between foes tracking just off the second flight to the backstretch, shifted out on the far turn while being prompted to
advance, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to the end to close the gap. INCA PRINCESS tracked the leaders three deep
in second flight to the backstretch, was urged to bid between foes in that path racing through the far turn then finished evenly between foes in the final
stages. SAMMY'S TOWN, restless in the gate, broke sharply, set the pace along the inside racing to the far turn, then gave way once headed nearing upper
stretch. THORCERESS angled in early while gaining a forward placing, was urged to lodge a brief bid between foes midway through the backstretch but
emptied out early. EVERYWHEREILOOK switched off the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, lodged an early bid in tandem with
a rival midway through the backstretch but quickly emptied out.

Footnotes
CONQUEST DAY broke readily, vied for the lead between foes, then along the inside racing into the turn, turned back a challenge from IKEISGREAT racing
into upper stretch under firm right handed pressure and was gathered up late once the issue was decided. ACCESSIBLE settled into stride off the second
flight racing unhurried in the opening stages, shifted out entering the turn and found his best stride in the closing stages to secure the place honors.
IKEISGREAT bobbled at the start while breaking a bit slowly, was switched outside foes, then hustled to join the leaders three deep racing into the turn,
shifted inwards nearing upper stretch pressing the issue but proved empty in the drive. MOZANO tracked off the first flight between foes racing into the turn
and continued evenly into the stretch. LANSE MITAN joined the pace outside foes in the opening stages, pressed between rivals into the turn and gave way
nearing upper stretch. ACTION WARRIOR, urged in brief pursuit of the leaders along the inside, emptied out early. HURRICANE MIKE dropped out early.

Footnotes
SAYYIDA AL HURRA tracked just off the first flight near the inside in the opening half, came through along the rail to challenge for command leaving the
midway point of the far turn, edged clear racing into upper stretch, shifted out in late stages but held sway to the end under brisk handling. SNEER, three
deep between foes in second flight racing to the first turn, dropped back a bit in that path on the backstretch, was prompted to gain position between foes on
the far turn, shifted inwards nearing upper stretch advancing on the pacesetter in tandem with SHINING COLORS, exchanged repeated contact with that
foe racing through the stretch but edged forward to prevail for the place honors late. SHINING COLORS tracked just off the leaders between foes in the
opening half, briefly awaited an opening on the far turn, angled to the inside nearing upper stretch advancing on the pacesetter in tandem with SNEER,
shifted out exchanging repeated contact with that foe racing through the stretch, then was steadied out of tight quarters in the final stages. PERT settled off
the second flight just off the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and made an effort to improve position. TEA PARTY, urged to
the lead from the break, dictated the pace on a narrow margin a bit off the rail racing to the far turn, then gave way into upper stretch. PINK PEPPERMINT
hopped at the start, was caught four wide racing into the first turn tracking just off the first flight, was prompted to lodge a brief bid in that path on the far turn
but soon emptied out. MYSTERIOUSLY angled inwards while moving to terms with the pacesetter attending the pace, was prompted racing into the far turn
and emptied out racing into the stretch. SINISTER SIREN settled outside foes dropping off the second flight early, was caught five wide racing into the far
turn and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
LAST PROMISE, forwardly placed near the inside in the opening stages, switched outside the leaders to race three wide on the backstretch, readily
advanced in that path to wrest command racing through the far turn, gained a clear advantage racing into upper stretch, then withstood the challenge of
TOWN CLASSIC through the stretch to narrowly prevail in a prolonged drive under brisk handling. The latter angled inwards a bit to track the leaders
between foes from out of striking distance to the backstretch, was prompted to split three deep in pursuit of the winner nearing upper stretch, shifted outside
that foe to challenge for command and pressed the issue to the wire in a protracted skirmish to just miss. I'M A G SIX settled off the second flight along the
inside racing to the far turn, shifted out to split foes just off the inside racing through the stretch and edged rivals for a share. ZITMAN settled last racing well
outside foes into the backstretch, advanced five wide racing into the stretch to gain some position but made no real impresssion. THE STIFLER switched
outside foes racing in second flight to the backstretch, shifted four wide racing into the stretch but had no closing bid. MIDNIGHT CURFEW, prompted to
gain a forward placing along the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily faded into the stretch. TAOS switched outside a rival racing to the first turn,
sprinted clear into the backstretch but gave way once headed by the winner.

NAVY ARMED GUARD gained a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, advanced to press that rival on the far turn,
dueled for command into upper stretch and went clear late under firm right handed encouragement. TWOCUBANBROTHERSU sprinted clear into the first
turn, set the pace racing a bit off the rail to the far turn, resisted the winner's bid to midstretch but proved no match late. GO AWAY tracked the leaders
between foes from just out of striking distance, advanced in tandem with several rivals three deep into upper stretch, was floated out while being bumped by
JOURNEYMAN in the closing stages but edged that rival for a share. JOURNEYMAN angled inwards tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance
as part of the second flight racing just off the rail to backstretch, shifted out through the stretch making some light contact with GO AWAY and was just
outkicked for a share. DAZZLING TRUTHS switched outside foes early to track the leaders three wide as part of the second flight, shifted out four wide
nearing the lane and faded in late stages. EPIC (ARG) settled outside foes dropping off the second flight, angled to the inside on the far turn but lacked a

ENDURING HONOR tracked off the second flight while shifting off the inside racing to the backstretch, angled out four wide nearing the far turn
commencing a steady advance, raced in that path into upper stretch and produced a steady late response to reel in GAME DAY DRAMA nearing the wire to
narrowly prevail under firm left handed encouragement. The latter sprinted clear into the first turn, held sway racing a bit off the rail to upper stretch, briefly
resisted the winner's bid but was collared at the wire. CANDY COVE switched out three wide racing to the backstretch tracking the pacesetter in second
flight, was urged to challenge in that path between foes nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. DONE ACTING tracked the pacesetter inside foes in
second flight, advanced to striking distance after a a half but faded into upper stretch. NOMINAL DOLLARS settled outside foes dropping off the second
flight to the backstretch, was caught six wide after a half and made some belated progress outside foes into the lane. IMPOSING WILL tracked off the
second flight three wide between foes to the backstretch and continued evenly between rivals while no real threat. ENTERTAINER settled near the inside
racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes racing through the far turn but offered no rally. BROWNS GAP tracked the pacesetter between foes in
second flight, lodged a brief bid nearing the far turn but quickly came up empty. SEEKING THE BAY, caught four wide racing through the first turn tracking
just off the second flight, steadily retreated after a half.

Footnotes
LUNA was settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance racing into the far turn, split foes three wide near the
quarter mile marker, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady late bid to wrest the advantage in time under some left
handed pressure. LADY ALIDA broke in the air losing some position to the leaders, was collected, then angled to the inside steadily gaining position,
advanced to press the issue inside a rival racing into the far turn, gained the advantage racing into upper stretch but couldn't fend off the winner.
COLONELS DAUGHTER settled in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside after a half, made brief progress inside foes nearing the
lane, shifted out three deep between foes entering the stretch but had no final kick. NATIVE LION, urged to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn,
set the pace a bit off the rail to the second bend, dueled outside a rival through the far turn and gave way into the stretch. SECRET TEMPLE, forwardly
placed three deep tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, came up empty on the far turn. ALLURING APPROVAL broke readily, was held up off
the leaders racing three deep to the backstretch and faded early.

SYCAMORE LANE angled inwards racing to the backstretch tracking just off the first flight, bid for command along the rail racing into the far turn, wrested
the advantage nearing upper stretch and held sway through the stretch under firm encouragement. GENERAL PADDY angled inwards to track off the first
flight three wide between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide entering the far turn and continued with a steady bid to the stretch but proved
only second best. PUDDING tracked the leaders between foes in second flight under light rating in the opening half, was shuffled a bit awaiting an opening
leaving the midway point of the far turn, angled in nearing the lane, then swung out four wide racing into the stretch to make some progress but had no final
kick. SPRING UP tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground following the eventual winner into upper stretch but had no final kick. THE
CURT FOX (GB), off slowly, was settled last along the inside and passed inside tiring rivals racing into the stretch. NAMARUNU (GER) tracked off the
