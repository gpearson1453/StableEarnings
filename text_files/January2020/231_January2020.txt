HOROSCOPE coaxed from the gate, established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside safely in front through sensible splits, shook away
at the midway point on the turn, spun just off the inside for home set down for the drive, dug in under lone threat to the outside through the final furlong, got
headed near the sixteenth marker and fought on gamely to get a nose back in front nearing the finish. VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD coaxed from the start,
chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled four wide
into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final eighth taking narrow command a sixteenth from home, battled on head to head to the finish
but was ultimately denied at the end while well clear of the rest for the place honors. SOUNDS GOOD five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, kept on through to the finish and was just up to procure the show honors. WOODBURY coaxed from
the gate, chased just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, got placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. PURCHASING POWER chased along the inside down the backstretch, tipped to the two path half a mile from home, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened. LE GROS BILL three wide in pursuit until tucked to the inside at the
half mile pole, came under a ride midway on the turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. BOOBY TRAP chased four then three
wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
HAWAIIAN NOISES was patiently ridden tracking the front runners from along the inside route, flashed some interest late on the bend, cut the corner with a
vast amount of clearance with which to work with, responded when given his cue, poking a head down in front by midstretch, edged away in the final
furlong. THE SICARII away without apparent mishap, stalked the pacesetter from the three path, crept up after the half had been rattled off, was floated five
to six wide by AMERICAN RULE as they turned into the lane, went by that foe during the run leading up to and then through the furlong grounds, but with
the winner having secured the top however, was worked inward thereafter with AMERICAN RULE following suit by steadfastly shifting closer to the inside
route himself, finished well clear of that opponent for place honors. AMERICAN RULE established the top shortly after the field had been sent on its way,
showed the way from path two on an open lead, pulling a bit on the left, sputtered four to five wide entering the stretch, taking the second place finisher
along for a ride, saw the top twosome each go by during the remainder of the trip to the eighth pole, gradually made its way back to the inside springing from
that station while getting outfinished. HOLIDAY BONUS pursued the pace from the two path, was under a drive by the five-sixteenths pole, lacked the
necessary stretch response. NO DISTORTION two to three wide on the turn, failed to menace. SWIPING DAN sent over to the rail at the half mile pole,
faltered off the ground-saving journey that followed.

Footnotes
BRONX BOMBER prompted the pace from the outside in the three path, remained patiently handled until set down spinning four wide into upper stretch,
took over command straightened away and drew clear under a drive to prevail. LATIN LOVE BUG three wide down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile
from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. ZONIC chased four
to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued four to five wide into upper stretch and improved position to be along for the show honors.
TAKE IT TO SCALE broke out at the start under hustling filling the lane left vacant by the slow breaking OUR HONOR, showed the way in hand just off the
inside under pressure from BRONX BOMBER to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and yielded the
front straightening away, then weakened through to the finish. OUR HONOR hesitant at the start, broke two lengths slower then the rest of the field and
conceded about four lengths to the front before advancing to chase just off the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped three
wide at the five-sixteenths before angling five wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the stretch. ALONGCAMETHEPRINCE bobbled at the start,
recovered to chase five wide down the backstretch, got floated six to seven wide as SPECTRE BOND angled out under a protective hold near the
three-eighths, cornered six to seven wide into upper stretch and faltered. SPECTRE BOND four wide in pursuit from just off the pace, lost his action nearing
the three-eighths and was placed to a firm protective hold, guided to the outside and pulled up inside that station and was subsequently vanned off.

FRANK'SGUNISLOADED secured a forward position after making light contact with HERSH at the start, stedadily advanced on the leader during the run
around the bend, struck the front as three-quarters was being completed, got turned loose spinning into the lane, drew out during the ensuing furlong, held
well to stay in the clear. CREA'S BKLYN LAW took up the chase three to four wide on the turn, being ridden along by the pilot, swung into the lane, failed to
keep pace with the winner, but had enough left late to save second. HERSH nudged inward while undergoing some contact with the winner, departed the
backstretch from the two path, fanned out into path five during the initial portion of the stretch, becoming the widest of all, mustered up a mild response after
being straightened away. EL HERMANO grabbed the advantage in short order, got set up in the two path, vied with SINGAPORE TRADER to the inside,
got set down but had the top one take over nonetheless in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, retreated down the lane. SINGAPORE TRADER
disputed the pace from along the inside route for nearly three-quarters before giving way.

and held sway to prevail. AINTITFUNKYNOW six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under a ride at the
five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. BEG TO DIFFER brushed at the start by FARRAGUT who broke
inwards, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn placed to coaxing three furlongs out, went six to seven
wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. FARRAGUT broke in at the start brushing BEG TO DIFFER, vied four then three wide with a trio down the

GLASS CEILING sat well rated two wide within striking distance, swung out into path four for the drive home, fought its way to a slim advantage by the
eighth pole, edged away. OFFICER HUTCHY taken hold getting away a bit slowly, got guided into the three path by the top of the turn, closed the gap,
angled five wide into the lane, displayed some late foot procuring the place. WEDONTBELIEVEHER the outermost of three contending for the top during the
opening phases, went at it to the outside of STUNNING MUNINGS afterwards, challenged in earnest at the three-sixteenths pole, saw the winner grab the
advantage by the beginning of the final furlong, stayed prominently placed for a little while longer before weakening. WONDER CITY sent over to the rail at
the half mile pole, was set down to a hard drive at the five-sixteenths pole, tipped towards the two path at the head of the stretch, made no impact.
MAGNETIQUE brushed at the start, took up the chase from the two path on the turn, angled into the third one for the drive home, lacked a solid closing
punch. STUNNING MUNNINGS between opponents vying for the lead during the initial stages, cut over to the rail, went at one on one with
WEDONTBELIEVEHER, stepped into the lane and faltered. ALL OVER THE MAP came inward losing her footing springing from the starting gate, made
light contact with its stall neighbor, departed the backstretch from the three path, commenced the stretch one wider, gave way. BELLA INVASION argued as
the innermost of three for the top early, retreated steadily after being dispatched by the others, took a five wide stroll into the lane then fell back even more.

Footnotes
TWISTED TOM saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied in tandem with
FLEET IRISH to overthrow the leader nearing the eighth pole, dug in dueling through the final furlong to the finish, battled on gamely to prevail at the end.
FLEET IRISH got bumped twice at the start by BIG MOUNTAIN who broke outwards and in turn bumped IRISH VALOR, lost his lane as that rival remained
uncorrected, settled just off the inside through the first turn at the tail of the field, chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then three to four wide
through the far turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, advanced and angled six wide into upper stretch, hooked up head to head with the
aforementioned foe near the eighth pole, dug in dueling with that rival to the finish but was ultimately bested at the end while along clear of the rest to be
second best. CARTHON four then three wide through the first turn, advanced to prompt the leader initially from the two path into the backstretch before
tipping three then four wide midway, tucked back to the two path into the turn advancing to vie between foes to the three-eighths, took over narrow
command near the quarter pole, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was overtaken inside the three-sixteenths, weakened
while along clear for the show honors. SHAMROCK KID three then two wide through the first turn, raced briefly three wide in aim of the front down the
backstretch before tipping to the five path, advanced tucked three wide into the far turn, briefly vied outside a pair before beginning to be shaken off near the
quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. BIG MOUNTAIN broke out at the start bumping FLEET IRISH twice, the second time into IRISH
VALOR, showed the way in hand along the inside, came under ever increasing pressure first from CARTHON and then that rival and SHAMROCK KID into
the far turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths briefly headed for command, took back the front midway on the turn ridden along, got displaced
near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. IRISH VALOR bumped at the start by FLEET IRISH due to pressure from BIG MOUNTAIN,
raced three wide through the opening bend before chasing three then four wide, came under a ride at the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper
stretch and tired.

Footnotes
GYPSY JANIE cut over to the rail coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, kept watch on the loose leader, cut the corner until a drive, closed in,
struck the front with approximately a sixteenth remaining, reached the wire in time to prevail. AUNT BABE underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn,
fanned out into the six path from upper to midlane, missed. SCIENCE FICTION departed the backstretch from path three, angled five wide for the drive
home, straightened away and mustered up a mild response sufficient enough to grab the show. SEA SPARKLE stalked the pace from the two path, had no
rally. FORGOTTEN HERO away one length the quickest, was on the inside route well before arriving at the half mile pole, showed the way on an open lead,
spun into the lead in possession of its largest lead, saw it chopped into readily, got collared in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole and faltered. PALOMITA rode
the rail, came under encouragement by the five-sixteenths pole, angled three wide into the stretch, had no offering. WEABIE three wide onto the turn, was
one wider exiting it, folded.
