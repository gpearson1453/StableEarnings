# Phase 2
In Phase 2, the extracted information is converted into usable data for the learning model that will be developed in Phase 3. This involves cleaning and reformatting data, designing a database schema and populating the database, and compiling information into statistical profiles for entities and training and testing units. The data is currently stored in a local PostgreSQL database and can be migrated to an online database service at a later date.
