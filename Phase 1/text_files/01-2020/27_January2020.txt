field, saved ground around the turn, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. STIHL HARBOR lacked early speed, racing evenly near the
back, made a late rally and missed second. B B SPECIAL pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late kick. JUST KISSING
BUCK raced in the back of the pack in the early going, came around the turn on the outside, five wide, showed late interest, but was no factor. JOBIM raced
in an even effort and was never a threat. PRIMETIME TIZ pressed the early pace and was finished early. CAJUN DUDE raced within striking distance and
retreated. NOSHACKLESHERE dueled on the front end, was finished early and retreated to the rear.

FULKERSON pressed the pace, racing four wide around the first turn, took the advantage entering the home stretch and was going away at the end.
MOSTLY SUNNY dueled for the lead, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. WEST VILLAGE raced in the
back of the pack in the beginning, made a late wide rally and got up for the show. RANDY PAUL lacked early speed, raced three wide around the final turn,
made a bid and was outfinished for third. HOOK raced within striking distance, finished evenly and lacked a late bid. EXTON vied for the early lead, saved
ground and faded down the home stretch. GRAND HOGA pressed the early pace and was done early. B BRAZIN hopped at the start, raced near the middle
of the field, before retreating to the back. THEBOYZGRAND KIS broke a step slow and was never close.

in time. HAYNESVILLE dueled for the early lead, drove clear and was caught at the wire. CONTRABAND vied for the lead, forwardly placed throughout, but
proved no match for the top two. AW SHUCKS raced in the middle of the field, made a late bid and just missed the show position. JALEN HURTS void of
early speed, improved position, but was no factor. SMOOTH MAN raced evenly near the back, saved ground and was never a threat. HAULIN' FREIGHT
pressed the early pace and faded. AIN'TSEENTHEBALL always raced near the back and showed little. HOLY SUNRISE raced in the middle of the field and
retreated.
