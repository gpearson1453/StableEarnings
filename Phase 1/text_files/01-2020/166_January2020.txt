rail, came out into the stretch, drifted in some in the drive and was clearly second best. ZILLINDA close up stalking the pace between foes then a bit off the
rail, angled to the inside on the second turn, continued along the fence in the stretch and edged a rival for the show. FLYING BLUE four wide into the first
turn, stalked outside then four wide leaving the backstretch, continued three deep on the second turn, came out into the stretch and was edged for third.

Footnotes
FLY THE SKY stalked three deep then outside a rival, steadied briefly into the second turn, bid outside the pacesetter to gain a slim lead on that bend,
kicked clear under left handed urging in the stretch and was under a hold late. COMMANDER (FR) forced in when between foes and bumped early, stalked
between rivals then outside a foe, steadied when crowded into the second turn, continued a bit off the rail on that bend and held second. GOVENOR CINCH
chased a bit off the rail then outside a rival, went three deep leaving the second turn and into the stretch and just held third. LEATHERNECK steadied
sharply off heels early, settled inside, came out into the stretch and was edged for the show. KNIFES EDGE also steadied sharply when bumped and
squeezed along the rail early, saved ground chasing the pace, went between horses leaving the second turn and just off the inside into the stretch and
lacked the needed rally. ARDENLEE STAR in tight and bumped early, stalked inside, cut the corner into the stretch and weakened. BRICKYARD RIDE had
speed four wide then came in onto foes early, angled in and set the pace inside, bounced off the inner rail for several strides into the second turn, fought
back inside the winner on that turn then ducked into and through the rail in upper stretch and fell. Claims of foul by the rider of KNIFES EDGE against
COMMANDER and BRICKYARD RIDE for alleged interference early were not allowed by the stewards, who ruled BRICKYARD RIDE was the cause of the
trouble. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the run of BRICKYARD RIDE into the second turn and in the stretch before ruling he was the cause of his
own trouble.

MAJESTIC DIVA dueled outside a rival, took the lead leaving the turn, inched away into the stretch and drew off under a left handed tap of the whip and a
steady hand ride then a long hold late. DESERT SMOKE had good early speed and dueled inside, fought back into the stretch and was clearly second best.
CONFORMATION saved ground stalking the pace, came out leaving the turn and into the stretch and bested the others. BRAGGING RIGHTS chased
inside then a bit off the rail, came three deep into the stretch and lacked a further response. RATTLE fractious in the post parade and warm up, stalked
outside a rival, dropped back off the rail on the turn and had little left for the stretch.

REEDLEY had speed between horses then inched away and angled in, set the pace along the inside, kicked away in the stretch and held on gamely under
urging. CUNNING MUNNINGS three wide early, stalked off the rail, came three deep into the stretch and finished willingly. EXULTATION close up stalking
the winner outside a rival, continued a bit off the rail in the stretch and also went on well between the top pair late. LUCKY ROMANO chased a bit off the rail
then between foes, steadied off heels early on the turn, continued just off the rail on the turn and into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. MIKE
OPERATOR saved ground chasing the pace, came a bit off the fence in the stretch and split horses at the wire. SUANCES SECRET stalked three deep
then outside a rival on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and did not rally. HARLISS saved ground stalking the pace throughout and weakened in the
final furlong, then was unsaddled nearing the clubhouse turn and vanned off. RINESHAFT dropped back off the rail early, angled in some leaving the
backstretch, found the inside on the turn, came out in the stretch and was outrun.
