Footnotes
GENTLE KISS allowed to settle, circled horses readily on the far turn, engage the runner up at the top of the stretch, made the lead past the furlong marker
under right handed urging and drew clear. IT'S SPRINGTIME unhurried early, split horses to the far turn, made the lead at the top of the stretch, battled with
the winner along the inside until deep stretch and finished second best. A GIRL HAS NO NAME chased the early pace from the inside, dropped back on the
second turn, swung out to the six path for the drive and came on again late. SQUATCHINGWITHLYSS close up, rallied three wide tom make the lead
midway on the far turn then came up empty. LA PAROTA was hustled along, chased the pace two wide into the far turn then weakened. COURT
REPORTER was no factor. DIXIE THREE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace into the far turn, stopped in the stretch and jogged to the
wire.

Footnotes
AILIS prompted the pace two wide, dug in gamely through deep stretch and got up in the final strides. GOLDEN PEARL made the lead soon after the start,
set all the pace under pressured from the winner and just failed by the narrowest of margins. DARLING DAAHER stalked the pace in an even effort.
KREATIVE KISSER failed to menace. TRICKERATION had speed into the turn then faded. PABLO CREEK was a sharp threat in the four path then through
after a half. GET NAUTI broke in a tangle, the rider lost his left iron and trailed throughout.

and edged clear late. ART THIEF allowed to settle, closed determinedly four wide into the stretch, was carried out a bit by the winner and finished second
best. PEBBLE SLINGER trailed into the far turn then closed a gap late in the six path. KITTY EXPRESS never far back, finished well inside. ZOE MY LOVE
stalked the pace three wide and faded in the final furlong. WRITTEN away alertly, set the pace off the rail for nearly six furlongs then gradually weakened.

Footnotes
FIRST DISTINCTION broke in full stride to set all the pace and widened through the stretch to win as much the best. ARCH LEGACY chased the winner,
shifted out to the four path entering the stretch and finished clearly second best. SEALED WITH A KISS broke a step slow and found her best stride late.
OUR PRINCESS BELLE allowed to settle, went evenly. FLYING PHILLIP'S also broke slowly, was well placed then lacked the needed response. DON'T
HOLD ME NOW trailed.
