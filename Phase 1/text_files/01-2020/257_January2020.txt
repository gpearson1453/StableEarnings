Footnotes
I'M EVER READY off slowly was rushed to contention looming outside the leader in upper stretch drawing clear gamely in the four path. DANTU went
evenly through the turn coming five wide in upper stretch coming on as second best. NOBLE BEHAVIOR hustled along pursued along the inside to upper
stretch weakening the final eighth. TRAMORE BAY raced mid pack losing ground to upper stretch finishing evenly in the six path. GIANT'S WILLOW sent
clear set the pace to upper stretch wilting late. GARDEN QUALITY slow early played no factor. DYNAMIC KID was never involved. ANOTHER
EXPERIENCE raced evenly wearing down to upper stretch. LEOPOLDO was always outrun. LONESOME PHIL had brief speed then faded on the turn.
WILLIECATCHEM gave way on the turn. JOSHUABULLIEVED labored throughout.
