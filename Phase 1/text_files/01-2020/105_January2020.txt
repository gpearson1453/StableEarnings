rounding the far turn, drew clear approaching the head of the lane, was steadily encouraged to widen then taken in hand late. ALLEGHENY DBL LIME
raced in the four path the first turn then stalked into the backstretch, challenged leaving the three eighths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage through the
far turn but dropped back into the lane and had to settle for second best. YODEL LADY settled close off the rail, bid leaving the three eighths pole, came
through the far turn about the four path then flattened stride the final sixteenth. LADY'S LADY saved ground the opening turn then bid toward the three
eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn but showed little more. HATTA DOUBLE raced well off the pace and showed little response down the
backstretch. IRMA GIRL rated the pace inside, was pressured from the three eighths pole, gave up the lead past the five sixteenths then faded at the rail
rounding the far turn. LIMEHOUSE LOUISE rated off the pace and off the rail, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole then weakened in the six path of the far

Footnotes
OUT OF CENTS stalked the early pace from the two and three paths then bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, dueled close in the three path of the far turn,
took the lead just inside the eighth pole and dug in determined to dissuade the runner-up. ISLAND CADGER drew clear and angled to the inside to set the
pace, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, dueled with the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn, gave up the nod just inside the eighth
pole but continued gamely to mid-stretch before ceding; reluctantly. BROTHER CORBIN loaded reluctantly, rounded the opening turn about the four path
and raced outside into the backstretch, started a bid past the three eighths pole, came through the far turn five wide and was along for third mid-stretch.
TRANQUIL BLUE steadied early on and settled off the pace and settled off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then
flattened stride leaving the turn. EARLSCASTLE saved ground close to the early pace, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on
the far turn then flattened stride. THE ASTRAL RASCAL steadied early and raced well back. BRO LATTE raced in the four path the first turn, bid from the
three eighths pole, came through the far turn still in the four path then weakened.

VONDA took immediate control to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, had her heels clipped by Run On Energy past the five
sixteenths pole and raced unchallenged from that point while drawing off. LONGSTORYLUCY settled close in the three path, bid nearing the seven

bid into the backstretch, checked to avoid a fallen rival past the five sixteenths pole and could only improve her position. NURSE TOMPKINS saved ground
off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole but checked to avoid a fallen rival past the five sixteenths pole. HOPEFUL ANGEL raced off the pace in the

Footnotes
SURFER GIRL CENTS stalked the pace in the two and three paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead two deep approaching the quarter,
opened up through the far turn and was steadily handled down the lane. WEEKEND FLYER raced in the five path the first turn and settled off the pace
leaving the turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and was not a match. TAC UP settled off the early pace in the
two and three paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole, continued in the three path of the far turn but flattened stride in the lane. TREASURED INFO rated
the pace inside, came under pressure at the three eighths pole, gave up the lead at the rail approaching the quarter, dropped back through the turn then
weakened. CISCO BAY raced well off the pace and off the rail the opening turn, left the turn outside, bid past the three eighths pole and could only improve
her position. GOLDEN VALE saved ground off the pace and showed little response through the backstretch. TRAFFICPLAN was not a factor. SECRET
ALCHEMY was through after three eighths.

Footnotes
SNIFF stalked the early pace two deep then challenged toward the three eighths pole, took over nearing the five sixteenths pole, drew off readily and was
taken in hand past the sixteenth pole. LANA raced off the pace and off the rail the first turn, bid approaching the quarter pole, rounded the far turn in the four
path and was along for second. JEAN GREY raced well back from early contention then started a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn about the five path and finished evenly outside. SHE'S A LIL PISTIL raced in the five path the first turn and settled back leaving the turn, bid past the
three eighths pole then saved ground to no avail on the far turn. WON LIL INDIAN improved her position. LASER LADEE rated close to the early pace then
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, but, faded on the far turn. I'M WARNING YOU rated the pace inside, was pressured toward the three
eighths pole, gave up the lead nearing the five sixteenths then weakened. RAMANTICAL raced off the pace in the four and five paths and never factored.
CHARITABLE VOW was through after a half mile.

JOOPSTER took over two deep past the three eighths pole and contested the edge at the rail on the turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement, but
was caught the final strides. GEORGE TOWN CAT gave chase inside and dug in at the rail down the lane to finish well. LITTLE PLUMBER gave chase and
dueled close two deep on the turn but dropped back into the lane and flattened stride the final sixteenth. NO MISTAKE N ME gave chase through the
backstretch then angled to the four path on the turn, angled widest into the stretch and passed rivals. ON THIS DAY gave chase inside then lacked room
through the turn. SIR PAULIE WALNUTS set the pace the opening three sixteenths, gave chase from the three eighths pole but weakened off the rail on the
turn. WILLIAMSBURG was taken to the outside and eased up early then walked off.

and hold off the runner-up the final yards. NOVA BOY raced well back off the rail the first turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and progressed
six wide on the far turn, dug in from the top of the lane to become a late threat, but, was outfinished the final yards. CLUBMAN raced well back from early
contention while saving ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole, angled off the rail midway on the far turn and entered the stretch five wide, was bottled up
at the heels of Fear The Turtle past the eighth pole, angled to the outside from there and finished evenly. AARON'S TAP stalked the pace in the three path
then challenged at the three eighths pole, took the lead two deep midway on the far turn, dug in under steady encouragement from the top of the lane but
was caught flattening stride later yards. RESCUE FIVE was hustled along at the rail through the front stretch then stalked into the first turn, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole, took aim two deep on the far turn but flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. FEAR THE TURTLE raced well back in the
two and three paths, bid from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in range of the lead in the five path of the far turn but weakened into the lane. LAST PRINT
was hustled to the lead and angled to the inside to set the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, gave up the lead at the rail midway on
the far turn then dropped back entering the stretch and weakened. DIAL OPERATOR raced off the early pace in the two and three paths, bid leaving the
three eighths pole then weakened on the far turn. After a claim of foul against the rider of Nova Boy, lodged by the rider of Clubman, the Stewards made no

allowed to relax later yards. ALL ABOUT TAP steadied leaving the chute then gave chase through the backstretch, had aim in the three path of the turn but
couldn't improve in the lane. GHOST MINE gave chase to mid turn then flattened out into the lane. EISELE gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn
then flattened stride. THE BIG STORM gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the four path on the turn and showed little more. QUICKEN
