Footnotes
MODERNIST broke on top and retained the advantage, carved out the pace, coaxed along and with DISTORTED SKY in accompaniment in the two path,
was called upon for more stepping onto the head of the stretch, drew out to a comfortable advantage, maintained it, capping off the final sixteenth best
described as being ridden out. COWTOWN saw the pilot applying a snug grip while wedged in between foes racing two wide for a good portion of the
journey around the clubhouse bend, stalked the front runners within striking distance on the backstretch after being released from that predicament, stepped
onto the far turn three wide, was switched over to brisk encouragement in the general area of the five-sixteenths marker, angled one path farther off the rail
for the drive home, straightened away and rallied for the place. DISTORTED SKY strung out three wide on the opening bend, worked out a tuck into the two
path after exiting it, prompted the winner while hitched up all the way to the quarter pole, challenged in earnest heading home, got staved off then was
outfinished for second. ZUZUDINI rated in the pocket tracking the top one for three-quarters, came up empty. UNCLE NED unhurried travelling two wide for
the opening six furlongs, fanned out into path five from upper to midlane, lacked the necessary response. COMMISSIONER DAVE quickly spotted along the
rail, wound up trailing almost throughout.

Footnotes
SPEIGHTFUL KITTEN along the outside throughout, underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn, angled towards the four path for entrance into the stretch,
had its momentum sapped momentarily getting taken hold off shying away from a shifting KAZMANIA in midstretch, resumed its rally after being given his
cue, at this juncture stationed in the five path, closed in relentlessly snatching away the decision in the shadow of the finish line. KAZMANIA tracked the
front runners from along the inside route, was worked into the four path from upper to midlane, wore down LE GENERAL in deep stretch only to get run
down by the winner at the wire. LE GENERAL sparred for the lead three wide, challenged in earnest spinning into the stretch, fought its way to the front end
during the ensuing furlong, displayed willingness to the end but got caught. HUSHION established the top in short order, got set up approximately two wide,
disputed the pace on near even terms while matched up with LE GENERAL, got roused as their tussle spilled over into the stretch, yielded for good with
about a furlong to go and weakened. FROSTED ICE hung out four wide on the turn, made no impact. VICAR'S LEGEND took the inside route until the end
of the bend, was ridden three wide into the stretch, altered course back over to the rail in midlane, ventured onward for another sixteenth before flattening
out.

Footnotes
MAD MUNNYS five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was just up in the
last jump to prevail. STAGE LEFT coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch,
dug in between foes and was in a bit tight as SNEAKINESS drifted out slightly near the eighth pole, gained more clearance and surged late to just miss on
the wire. SNEAKINESS broke in at the start brushing OUT LAST BUCK who in turn bumped MYSTICAL SONG, chased four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to poke a head in front a furlong out, dug in under threat from a trio and was
nailed in the final strides. OUR LAST BUCK brushed at the start by SNEAKINESS and in turn bumped MYSTICAL SONG, chased four then three wide
under a ride three furlongs from home, swung six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the last major share. SEANOW showed the way in
hand two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was headed a furlong out,
weakened in the late stages. TALE OF MIST six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and through the turn, went ten wide into upper stretch
and was outkicked while making late headway. COACH VILLA six paths off the inside in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, went nine wide for
home and offered no response. VENTUS brushed at the start by MYSTICAL SONG, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun
three wide for home and made no impact. MYSTICAL SONG bumped at the start by OUR LAST BUCK due to pressure from SNEAKINESS breaking
inwards and in turn brushed VENTUS, chased four wide under a ride from midway on the turn, cornered five wide for home and tired. QUIZZICAL CAJUN
three wide in pursuit, bobbled near the nine-sixteenths suffering a catastrophic injury, got placed to a firm protective hold and was expertly pulled up by the
rider, then was subsequently euthanized on track.

Footnotes
IMPETUOUS secured a prominent position after overcoming contact from both sides at the break, emerged with the advantage after vying from between
opponents during the initial stages, cut over into the three path, showed the way thereafter rated on a loosely-contested advantage, got asked for its best in
the general area of the eighth pole, offered the desired response and kicked further clear. JERRY THE NIPPER got shaken off by the top one after disputing
the pace during the opening phases, went on to stalk IMPETUOUS from the two path, got set down at the five-sixteenths marker, spun into the lane, proved
no match. FROZEN ACCOUNT bumped at the start, appeared to have trouble with the footing early on the backstretch, got guided onto the inside route
approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, contently brought up the back of the pack, was fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch, rallied for
the show. MOMMIE'S JEWEL tracked the front runners from along the inside route,entered the lane and faltered. A VOW OF BEAUTY chased the pace
from the two path on the turn, swung out three to four wide into the lane, came up empty. BREWMAN was one of three fighting for the top early, saw the
winner take charge, sat forwardly placed four wide to the end of the bend then folded. MONTAUK MEMORIES four wide and urged on the turn, gave way.
BETA struck the left side of the gate after tossing its head just as the field was about to be sent off and running, departed the backstretch towards path two,
strolled into the five path heading home under a protective hold then was allowed to fade away.

Footnotes
DADDY KNOWS off the inside throughout, vied for the top towards the two path on the turn, swung out approximately four wide into the lane with
CENTRIST directly abreast, settled in and was given his cue in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, edged away from the nemesis then dug in late to
fend off the second place finisher. TIERGAN chased the pace from path four from midpack, got sent out six wide spinning into the lane, narrowed in, fell
short. CENTRIST took up position in the three path after the field had been released, contested the pace matched up with DADDY KNOWS during the run
around the bend, got cued up coming up to the three-sixteenths pole, was staved off, stayed on for the show. LEGION STORM strung out three to four wide
on the turn, angled five wide entering the stretch, mustered up a mild response. FINANCIALSTABILITY two wide stepping onto the turn, was placed in path
three exiting it, had no rally. BEACHSIDE kept an eye on the front runners from just off the inside until the quarter pole, was worked into the six path from
upper to midstretch, made no impact. TRUE GOLD advanced to contest the pace after being asked for run springing from the starting gate, was no longer
heavily involved in the pace dispute by the top of the turn, stepped into the lane and made no headway. TEN TWENTY NINE tucked into the two path on the
backstretch, stayed there until the end of the bend, moved outward during the stretch run until seven wide, had no response.

Footnotes
MR. BUFF established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside through the first turn before taking to the three path
down the backstretch, remained patiently handled through the far turn as rivals got busy in behind, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, went five
wide into upper stretch placed to a drive, drew off under a drive through the stretch and was geared down in the late stages. BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON three
wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide isolated between the top trio and a rival detached in behind, came under light coaxing half a mile from
home, swung three wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid to the eighth pole, proved no match for the top one, dug in and just held on for the place honors
on the wire. ADVENTIST got lightly bumped between foes at the start, raced two to three wide detached at the tail of the field and well behind in the early
stages, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, made ground and swung four wide into upper stretch, then kicked on belatedly closing well and just
missed for the place honors while never threatening the winner. LEITONE (CHI) forwardly placed three wide through the first turn, raced four wide in closest
aim of the leader down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, weakened in
the stretch. STAN THE MAN just off the leader three wide through the first turn, chased five wide coming under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled eight
wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
HOT LITTLE HONEY assumed a forward position after the start, stalked the pace four wide on the turn, got called upon after the half had been rattled off,
stepped into the lane and challenged in earnest at the three-sixteenths marker, shied out a bit deep into the furlong grounds yet claimed the lead by a
narrow margin, vied with vigour against the runner up the rest of the way home and got the job done. KEFALIANI kept watch on the front runners from along
the rail, slipped to the outside at the five-sixteenths marker, turned into the lane with clearance along its path, narrowed in, dueled with the winner from the
eighth pole onward, wound up denied. KITTEN HEELS underwent a four wide pursuit on the turn, commenced the stretch one path wider, crept up into
contention during the ensuing furlong then flattened out. MORE DIAMONDS away to sharp start, disputed the pace three wide until the end of the bend and
gave way. MAYBE A RAINBOW bumped at the start, raced as a forward factor from the two path until upper stretch, faltered. BROADWAY ANGEL took up
the chase from the two path on the turn, was moved out five wide after entering the lane, made no impact. BARKER LANE four wide onto the turn, was sent
out towards path six exiting it, failed to menace. QUEENTIGUA cut over to the rail on the backstretch, sat prominently positioned for the initial half, got
driven three wide into the lane, lacked a response and backed away. KEYPIT travelled two wide on the turn, wandered out towards path six from upper to
midlane on empty. LOVELY AVA off approximately two lengths the slowest after coming in with her first step, got guided onto the inside route, went on to
save ground to no avail. ON TO CINCINNATI made contact with MAYBE A RAINBOW at the start, was sighted three wide on the bend, never reached a
contending position.
