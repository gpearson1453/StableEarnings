effort. AGENT GIBBS vied two across to the turn and stopped. ZOE'S PAPA CEE broke awkwardly and failed to threaten. JAZZIE CAT ran loose behind the

Footnotes
CHEAP O CHARLIE got through along the rail on the turn, drew clear and held safely while kept to task. BATTI MAN (ARG) dueled to the turn, swung wide,
dropped back, continued willingly and held for place. RUNN'N REBEL bumped and was in tight after the stretch, swung wide leaving the turn and closed
well to earn show. PLUM LUCKY was checked after the start, found his best stride late and was gaining ground. SAND HARBOR pressed between horses
to the turn, fell back and finished evenly. OUTLAW BY NATURE bumped after the start, bid inside on the turn and came up empty. BROTHER BOB was
outrun in an even effort. VALID PRINCE raced inside, angled out on the turn, swung wide and lacked a rally. CARVILLE bumped after the start, dropped
inside and lacked a bid. UTANDREAM bumped at the start and was not a factor. WARRENSDIRTYDANCER bumped at the start, dueled to the turn and
stopped.
