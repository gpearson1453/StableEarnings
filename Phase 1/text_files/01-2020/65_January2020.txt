Footnotes
KAREN'S GEM, widest in top flight, gradually moved closer to the rail, shook loose and was clear mid stretch and held on under strong handling. IRON
LILLY raced and rallied very wide on the turn and through stretch and was gaining. MORISSETTE advanced racing three wide on the turn, challenged near
stretch but then flattened out. DOUBLE THE BET broke slowly, angled out on the turn then moved in and split foes through stretch and was too late. NOT IN
THE MOOD, very wide, failed to be a serious threat. SWEET AUGUST LADY saved ground, split rivals in deep stretch and was too late. RAPIDEZ set the
early pace inside winner then tired. LUV HER BABY BLUES broke slowly and failed to menace. POSTINO'S IDOL raced between foes, steadied in tight
near mid stretch. ABSENCEISPRESENCE, outside, failed to threaten. DANCINGTHEHNYDAWAY dueled for command between foes then tired. TRAPPS
STAR, just off the rail vying for command, had nothing left.

Footnotes
I'M NOT JOKING pressed the pace in the early stages, then dueled two wide, continued to duel with HELL OF AFIRE on the far turn, led into the lane and
edged away, driving. HELL OF AFIRE set the pace on the inside, then dueled inside for command, battled with the winner on the far turn and dug in gamely
inside in the stretch drive. SILVER EXCESS tracked along the inside, saved ground while chasing the leaders on the far turn, angled out and rallied mildly.
SWEET MAGGIE MAE raced off the pace between rivals, moved up three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and gained mildly outside.
MISS AVALON raced off the pace inside and did not factor. SHE MAKES ME SMILE raced four wide early, then stalked outside, chased on the turn and
faded. PENANCE raced three wide off the pace and gave way.
