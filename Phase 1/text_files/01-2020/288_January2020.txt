Footnotes
TOX was reserved just off the leaders early, advanced four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew clear. LIVINIT broke
sharply to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole, remained in control through mid-stretch but
could not match strides with the winner late. HEROS DON'T DIE was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, advanced five-wide through the turn and
finished with good late energy. PRO LONG broke sharply to chase the leaders from between foes, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly in
the drive. ONE FINE ROMANCE lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and improved his position in the drive. OFF THE WAGON was void of
early speed, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out approaching the stretch and finished with some late run. ANCHOR LEG settled off the leaders
from the inside throughout and failed to rally. ELIAS CHOICE chased the leaders from the inside for three furlongs and weakened. PAIN FOR GAIN was
fractious at the gate then off slow, lagged far back early and did not reach contention. PURE PRO showed brief speed from between foes and weakened.

Footnotes
ONE STOP SHOP broke sharply then raced unhurried early, advanced three-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole, reached L.
A. TOWER with a furlong to run, vied with that rival and prevailed through a vigorous drive. L. A. TOWER sprinted clear soon after the start, raced
three-wide while setting the pace, responded when challenged by the winner in mid-stretch, vied with that rival and just missed in a game effort. SKY
DEFENCE was away in good order to chase the pace of L. A. TOWER while racing four-wide, could not reach the top pair in the drive but finished willingly.
FIVE STAR KIP lagged early, raced six-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. DEPUTY'S ECHO was forwardly placed early, moved
four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. WILMAS IRISH ROVER chased the leaders from the inside for five furlongs and weakened.

Footnotes
ENGAGEMENT RING sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace, increased his margin into the stretch and was ridden out
to be kept to task. SURF N DELMAR was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but
was clearly second best. SIXTH GEAR lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. LET'S WAGER was off a step
slow then allowed to settle, raced six-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. DIABOLICAL TURN was away in good order to chase the winner while
racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. JEWEL OF NAVARONE showed no early speed, saved ground throughout and did not threaten.
SKIP BO settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. STACKING ROCKS showed no early foot, raced
three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. SHIO was reluctant to load then off a step slow, rushed to contend, chased from the inside and weakened
after the opening quarter. PER RULING FROM THE NEW MEXICO RACING COMMISSION, ENGAGEMENT RING WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE
TEST.

Footnotes
JUST CALL ME KEN was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the quarter and drew off with complete authority.
AVENATTI showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished with a steady rally to gain the
place. BUDDY P. was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, reached a contending position but failed to gain in the drive. FULL SUN was
forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and lacked the needed late response. CLASSY
HOMEWRECKER broke sharply to chase the leader while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. SHANGHAIED ROO broke in the air, raced
three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. BUBBA NIGHTLINGER showed brief speed and weakened. MEMORY TAKER was away in good order to
set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole, was eased up soon after, bled outwardly and was vanned off.

Footnotes
LESTER'S MEMORY tracked the early pace, went four wide into the turn, made a bid at the quarter pole, dueled with DRIVE THRU GARY to the wire and
prevailed. DRIVE THRU GARY set a pressured early pace, raced between rivals into the turn, met the bid of the winner, drifted out, dueled to the wire and
finished second best. SALTIE FIRE stumbled at the start, went three wide into the turn, angled to the inside and was empty late. INDIO SONADOR raced in
mid pack early, went six wide into the turn and evenly late. GERDA'S GONE was void of any early speed, circled eight wide into the turn and offered a mild
late rally. INDIAN DRAGON pressed the early pace, went five wide into the turn and tired. STRIKE A STORM forced the early pace from the inside and
faded. FORGOTTEN SLEW was outrun early, went six wide into the turn and never fired. CORDES was unhurried early, advanced seven wide into the turn
and offered no late rally. TEE CEP was allowed to settle early and retreated.

Footnotes
TRUST THE VAN raced five-wide through both turns, settled off the leaders early, reached the fore nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lead into
the lane and held off the closing G M GAGE to prevail. G M GAGE was off a step slow then allowed to settle, advanced five-wide through the second turn
and finished with good late energy. MR. DIGGER lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and finished with a late bid. MCCLASSIC was
void of early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly in the drive. TUCKER D raced five-wide through the first turn, chased the
leaders while racing five-wide and gave way through the final furlong. HIT A LICK was away in good order to chase the leaders while racing three-wide and
gave way after going three-quarters. FANCY STRIPE settled off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out approaching the
stretch and was not a factor. SUNDAY SHRIMP was forwardly placed from between foes and gradually weakened. QUIEN ES set a pressured pace for a
half and weakened. MY BULL lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not reach contention.
