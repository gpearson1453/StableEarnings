Footnotes
BROAD EXPANSE rated off the pace about the three path then started his rally from the half mile pole, raced at a close disadvantage while still in the three
path of the far turn, dug in through the stretch to get the lead in the final yards and held on. THE PREDICTOR rated a short lead inside and was met at even
terms leaving the half mile pole, came under pressure from that point, dropped back at the rail through the far turn but angled three wide leaving the turn
and dug in to take second the final strides while missing at the wire. TRAVEL TRUE stalked the pace from the three path then challenged at even terms into
the backstretch, had the lead into the far turn and contested the advantage nearest the rail through the turn and deep stretch before flattening stride. I NEED
YOU settled off the pace in the three and four paths then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path, angled to the
inside past the eighth pole then flattened stride. YELLOW WOLF stalked the pace inside, bid from the three eighths pole then faded past the five sixteenths.
WHISKEY CREEK saved ground off the pace and showed little response through the backstretch.

angled four wide entering the stretch, dug in for the lead later yards and drew clear nearing the wire. FASTDRIVEN broke awkwardly and made contact with
Theheatofthenight then set a clear pace toward the inside, dug in leaving the turn, was caught in later yards but dug in to win the nod for second.
THEHEATOFTHENIGHT was bumped at the break then gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail, dug in through the stretch but
missed the nod for second under the wire. LONG HEIR chased the pace inside and raced at the rail through the turn, then flattened stride the final sixteenth.
TOP HAT SCRUTINY chased the pace about the four path then bore out into the turn and showed little more. MUSTA NEVER MET U gave chase through
the backstretch then weakened in the five path of the turn.

then recovered stride past the pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, dueled to the lead mid-stretch and drew away through later yards. EARLSCASTLE
raced four wide the first turn and settled off the pace from the seven eighths pole, started a bid nearing the three eighths and dueled close two deep on the

gave up the nod toward mid-stretch then flattened stride the final sixteenth. TRANQUIL BLUE settled off the pace about the three path then bid nearing the
three eighths pole, but flattened stride on the far turn. BLIMEY LIMEY stalked the pace off the rail, challenged nearing the three eighths pole then faded

TECHNICALLYSPEAKIN raced off the pace in the three path the first turn then settled outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
steadily progressed to take the lead at the quarter, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on with steady encouragement. THE SON WIND saved ground the
opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the four path of the far turn, dug in for second
later yards and was gaining on the winner. MORE DATA raced four wide the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and dueled to a brief lead past the five sixteenths, but was caught at the quarter, continued close through the far turn, but dropped back
mid-stretch and flattened out the final sixteenth. WAR STROLL raced well off the early pace toward the inside then eased out into the backstretch, bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path then flattened stride. TWO PUTT settled off the pace and off the rail the opening turn
then picked up the chase into the backstretch, but showed little response and flattened out off the rail on the far turn. PUGET SOUND raced off the pace
toward the inside and showed little response through the backstretch. PISTOLINMYPOCKET angled in to stalk the pace two deep, gave chase leaving the
three eighths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. ENASOIT rated the pace inside, was pressured nearing the three eighths pole, gave up the the lead
past the five sixteenths then gave way at the rail on the far turn. SLICK MAN saved ground into the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch,
was roughed from a boxed in position off the heels of Pistolinmypocket in the vicinity of the three eighths pole and gave way from there.

Footnotes
FOURTEEN CARROT settled off the pace in the two and three paths, rallied from the five sixteenths pole to take the lead past the quarter, drew clear
midway on the far turn, drifted into the lane but held on well with steady handling. GREAT QUEST saved ground off the pace then bid leaving the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, dueled for second through the upper stretch and was gaining late on the winner. CAN DO TOO rated the pace
inside, came under pressure past the three eighths pole, gave up the lead leaving the quarter pole then weakened near the rail. CROSSWARD rounded the
opening turn in the five path and was well off the lead into the backstretch, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole but showed little more in the five path of the
far turn. FIRST DRAFT stalked the pace off the rail, bid only mildly through the backstretch then flattened out at the rail on the far turn. UNCLE JESSIE was
not a factor. OL BUDDY was never a factor. ARE U bore out into the first turn, was no factor while racing wide then eased in the stretch.

Footnotes
SERVE settled off the pace in the three and four paths then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close through the far turn, drifted a bit into the lane
but dug in for the lead mid-stretch and drew away later yards. GEORGE TOWN CAT angled to the inside to rate the pace, was pressured from the three
eighths pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail rounding the far turn, ceded the lead mid-stretch and gave way in later yards. COBH raced in the five
path the first turn and was well off the pace into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, was carried to the seven path on the far turn then dueled
for third and finished evenly. PAXOS raced in the six path the first turn then bid into the backstretch, drifted toward the head of the lane and showed little
more. MACANAO raced well off the pace, was carried to the nine path rounding the far turn and passed some rivals down the lane. SCHLOSSER settled
close inside then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then weakened. CENT COMM saved ground through the
opening turn and was well off the pace into the backstretch, bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, angled to the eight path on the far turn and showed
little more. JAI BLUE was through early. THE IRON BANK was never a factor. ON THIS DAY stalked the early pace from the three path, picked up the
chase at the seven sixteenths pole then faded toward the far turn.
