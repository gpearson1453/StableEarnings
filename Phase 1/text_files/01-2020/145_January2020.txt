PRIMA GOLD broke readily, dictated the pace a bit off the rail into the backstretch, turned back several challengers racing into upper stretch and was
roused to widen the advantage late. FLASHY PATCH tracked the pacesetter between foes under light rating to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing
into the far turn while being prompted to advance in that path and proved best of the others. SOUTHERN N' SASSY, urged to terms with the eventual
winner prompting that foe into the first turn, attended the pace through the backstretch, was urged to bid between foes nearing upper stretch but gave way
into upper stretch. PATRIOTIC ENDEAVOR, bumped, then shuffled back at the start, settled inside foes tracking the leaders from out of striking distance to
the far turn, angled out four wide in upper stretch and gained some position while no real threat. SECRET TEMPLE tracked the pacesetter inside foes into
the backstretch but gave way racing into the far turn. VALERIE FIRST broke outwards bumping a rival, was settled between foes in the last flight, faded into
the far turn, then was fanned five wide into the stretch. TWOFOUR SIX OH ONE, caught four wide racing into the first turn, retreated steadily after a half.

FLY NIGHTLY angled to the rail leaving the chute to stalk the pacesetter along the inside to the far turn, was prompted to advance inside foes leaving the
far turn, swung out entering upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to prevail in time under firm right handed encouragement.
EMPIRICALLY moved to the fore along the rail in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a narrow margin under light rating to the far turn, was prompted
to go clear racing into upper stretch but couldn't quite fend off the winner. WINTER'S WONDER angled in a bit to track off the first flight between foes under
rating, shifted out three deep nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to improve his position. CORCORAN settled along the inside in early stages,
saved ground throughout to briefly gain some position but had no final kick. ITSMYLUCKYSUMMER tracked the leaders outside foes for five furlongs and
steadily faded nearing the lane. FOR QUALITY, pulling a bit against restraint in the opening stages, attended a rival's pace into the backstretch, was urged
to prompt the pacesetter racing into the far turn but gave way entering upper stretch.

WHISTLE ME HOME broke readily, switched out a rival racing to the first turn to stalk that foe under light rating, came under pressure entering the far turn
to maintain striking distance and responded to firm left handed encouragement in the closing stages to wrest the advantage and go clear under strong
handling. OLLIVANDER was urged to the lead from the outset while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, was
prompted to edge clear nearing upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner's bid. PAINTER'S PRIDE angled to the inside racing to the first turn tracking
just off the leaders, shifted outside the top pair racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. POLLOCK tracked just off the pacesetter three wide
between foes to the backstretch, continued in that path to the far turn and faded into the stretch. BROWN ESSENCE, caught four wide racing through the
first turn to the backstretch tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance, continued outside rivals and steadily faded into the far turn.

Footnotes
PALIZA, prominent between rivals from the outset, was urged to dictate the pace while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, maintained a narrow
advantage while repelling a rival's bid racing into the far turn, shifted out racing into the stretch and edged clear under firm handling. BRONX RUMBLE
angled inwards in the opening stages to track off the second flight between foes, made steady progress on the far turn splitting foes, shifted three wide into
the stretch and continued with a steady effort to edge a rival for the place honors late. CPL. DIONICIO hopped at the start, was righted to track off the
second flight three wide between foes to the backstretch, made steady progress entering the far turn while angling inwards, shifted inside the winner while
continuing to pursue that foe into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. HEY GRIFF, a bit rank while held up last while shifting off the inside racing
to the first turn, split rivals three deep racing into the far turn, swung five wide in upper stretch and continued with a mild bid. COOLISTHERULE angled to
the inside tracking off the second flight but offered no rally. ATTIKA, broke inwards bumpingOHIO EAGLE, was urged to gain a forward placing racing three
deep to the backstretch, advanced to prompt the leader entering the far turn but soon emptied out. IAMBUTTER, caught four wide racing through the first
turn to the backstretch, steadily faded after a half. OHIO EAGLE, bumped at the start, was urged to brief contention between foes, was through after a half.
BUDDY'S PEAK'N, forwardly placed along the inside in the opening stages, steadily faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
MS. GENUINE ducked outwards at the start, was righted while being urged to contend inside rivals through the backstretch, was eased back off the leaders
nearing the turn while shifting out, continued under pressure to advance three deep nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to
wrest the advantage and go clear under firm left handed encouragement. BREWEDTOBEPERFECT, caught five wide in the opening stages while being
prompted to the press the issue outside foes, angled inwards racing into the turn while moving to gain a clear advantage along the inside in upper stretch
but weakened once headed by the winner. DATING, shuffled a bit start avoiding close quarters at the start, was urged in pursuit of the leaders while angling
inside on the backstretch, swung out four wide racing into the lane and continued to make a mild gain. UPPER CHARLIZE DS shied outwards avoiding MS.
GENUINE at the start, was quickly righted to gain a position just off the first flight between foes tracking the leaders into the turn and continued evenly to late
stages. J'S THREESTEP HALO, forwardly placed three deep between foes in the opening stages, tracked just off the first flight outside foes racing to the
turn and steadily faded. CAPTAIN ANGEL, in touch with the first flight four deep between foes, angled inwards prompting the pace just inside the pacesetter
into the turn and gave way into the lane. TRAP GIRL, settled out close quarters in the opening stages, never gained contention.

Footnotes
ODE TO JOY tracked off the second flight unhurried in the opening stages, commenced a steady advance three deep racing into the turn, moved to
challenge for command in that path nearing midstretch, then wrested the advantage to go clear late under firm handling. SUMMER FROCK, a bit restless in
the gate, was settled along the rail racing to the turn, shifted out gathering momentum racing into upper stretch and improved her position between foes
while narrowly prevailing for the place honors on the wire. J'S INDIAN CHARM broke sharply to gain the advantage, was urged along the inside disputing
the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, dispatched a rival while shifting off the inside in upper stretch, briefly resisted the winner's bid but
yielded late while just losing second. CLEARWATER, a bit reluctant to load, gained a forward placing three deep in the opening stages, tracked the leaders
between foes racing into the turn, shifted out in upper stretch and was fanned five wide in the closing stages while continuing with some interest.
BROADWAY RUN, reluctant to load, angled to the rail in early stages tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance, saved ground to upper stretch
gathering some momentum, was held up avoiding tight quarters just inside the pacesetter approaching the furlong marker, switched out to race between
foes in the closing stages but had no final kick. ROYALLY COOL, urged to terms prompting the pacesetter racing into the turn, gave way into upper stretch.
IT'S EASY TO SAY caught widest early, failed to menace.

Footnotes
SULTRY SAMURAI broke readily to gain a forward placing, tracked just off the leaders racing three deep into the turn, made a steady advance on the turn
to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage and drove clear. BULKCARRIER was urged to gain terms with the pacesetter after
the opening three sixteenths forcing the pace, dueled for command into upper stretch to strike the front but proved no match for the winner. JUST SHOOT
ALREADY, carried out a bit avoiding traffic at the start, tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight racing three deep into the turn and
continued with an effort to gain some position. FLYING BANKROLL, bumped at the start, angled to the rail early tracking behind the second flight, shifted
outside a tiring foe nearing midstretch and improved his position to the end. MOLOKAI NIGHT broke sharply, angled to the rail setting the pace racing to the
turn, dueled for command inside foes to upper stretch and emptied out. ODESSA GOLD, bumped by STERLING JUDGE and forced into the path of SMILE
ALL THE WAY at the start, tracked off the second flight between foes into the turn but had no rally. TOMMY TUESDAY settled between foes racing to the
turn and failed to menace. SMILE ALL THE WAY, bumped, then shut off at the start, raced wide throughout while proving no threat. SHIP LOCK, ducked
outwards at the start bumping FLYING BANKROLL, was settled last along the inside, angled out entering the lane but never seriously menaced. STERLING
JUDGE veered out at the start bumping ODESSA GOLD, was righted to make brief pursuit of the leaders just off the inside to the turn but came up empty
after a half.

UNCORK THE BOTTLE angled to the rail in the opening stages tracking off the first flight under rating, continued unhurried to the second bend, shifted just
off the inside to split rivals while being urged to advance in close quarters leaving the three sixteenths marker, exchanged some contact with IRISH
EXPECTATIONS and edged forward between foes in the closing stages to prevail under steady handling. VALIANT VIRTUE angled to the rail racing to the
first turn setting the pace on a narrow margin, conceded the lead to attend a rival pace through the backstretch while under light rating, was prompted to
regain the advantage on the far turn, edged forward into upper stretch but proved no match for the winner. RECKLESS SPIRIT tracked off the first flight
outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was prompted to a forward placing after a half, shifted out to bid three wide, then four wide entering upper stretch,
exchanged some contact with IRISH EXPECTATIONS in upper stretch, then was collected to continue to press the issue while outkicked by the top pair.
MATTY'S EXPRESS, very reluctant to load prior to the start, tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, angled four wide racing
into upper stretch while being prompted to advance, was steadied avoiding traffic entering the lane and had no final kick. HIGH HEATER tracked off the
second flight along the inside to the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with an even effort. IRISH EXPECTATIONS, urged to terms with
the pacesetter forcing the issue into the backstretch, pressed that foe into the far turn while losing the advantage, was bumped from both sides entering the
lane and quickly emptied out. NEAT STREET trailed throughout. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF IRISH EXPECTATIONS LODGED CLAIMS OF
FOUL AGAINST THE RIDERS OF THE WINNER AND RECKLESS SPIRIT BUT EACH CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
FALSE INFO was rated outside a rival tracking off the first flight, advanced readily when called upon to challenge three wide racing into the far turn, edged
forward to a narrow advantage racing into the stretch and gamely held the challenge of TETSU under firm handling. The latter prompted a rival's pace along
the rail into the backstretch, conceded some ground to the leaders after a half, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch and continued willingly to
close the gap. SEGISMUNDO tracked off the first flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, switched out after a half to press the issue between foes
racing into the far turn, dueled into upper stretch, then yielded to the top pair late and was vanned off the course following the race. GENERAL, reluctant to
load, was caught wide racing to the backstretch dropping off the second flight, swung out six wide racing into upper stretch and made some belated
progress. EMBATTLED, urged along forcing the pace outside a rival into the backstretch, dueled for command inside foes racing into the far turn and gave
way into the lane. MIGHTY GHOST tracked off the second flight between foes but had no closing bid. SKY KNIGHT tracked off the second flight outside
foes, angled out five wide racing into the lane and faded late. JACK THE CAT, reserved while angling nearer the inside in early stages, switched out to
advance five wide between foes in upper stretch, was steadied out of tight quarters near midstretch and had no further response. SOUL KITTEN tracked off
the second flight along the inside but faded early. ONEWAYTICKET hopped at the start and trailed throughout.
