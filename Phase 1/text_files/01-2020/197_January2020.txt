Footnotes
ROSEY SKY had speed outside a rival then stalked off the rail, bid alongside that one on the turn, took the lead into the stretch, was shaken up with the
reins to kick clear in the stretch and proved best under a steady hand ride. BELLA CHICA broke out, bumped a rival and steadied, angled in and saved
ground, came out leaving the turn and three deep into the stretch and edged a rival late for the place. CIVIL SUIT close up stalking the pace inside,
continued along the rail on the turn and in the stretch and was edged for second. SPANISH CHANNEL broke in a bit, tugged three deep between horses,
angled in on the turn, split rivals in midstretch and deep stretch and bested the others. INTO RISSA hesitated to be away behind the field, settled inside,
went outside a rival on the turn and into the stretch, came out some in the drive and finished with some interest. LOVE NOT WAR pulled her way along to
stalk the pace outside a rival to the stretch, was between foes past midstretch and weakened. SUEZAAANA sped to the early lead, inched away and set the
pace inside, fought back on the turn and into the stretch, was between foes in deep stretch and also weakened. DANNYBOB bumped at the start, chased
between foes then a bit off the rail, was in a bit tight and shuffled back on the turn, came out into the stretch and lacked a rally. MRS. KIMBERLY K chased
four wide then three deep on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened.

the stretch to deep stretch and held third. SALAH chased off the rail then outside a rival leaving the turn and three deep into the stretch and lacked the
needed rally. MEADWAY settled outside then three deep leaving the backstretch and into the turn, continued outside on the bend and three wide into the
stretch and did not rally. GOLD N GRAND chased off the rail then between horses leaving the backstretch and into the turn, angled in a bit off the fence
leaving the turn and weakened. WEST WAY DREAMS broke slowly, dropped back just off the rail, fell farther back on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
NADAL a half step slow to begin, went up inside to duel for the lead, inched away briefly into the turn, edged away again leaving the turn, came off the rail
into the stretch, was shaken up with the reins and the whip turned down to kick clear, drifted in and proved best under a tap of the stick and steady handling.
EXAULTED broke a bit slowly, settled off the rail, angled in on the turn and went up the rail in the stretch for the place. LANE WAY chased off the rail then
moved up inside on the turn, came out in upper stretch and was edged late outside a rival for second. JEFFNJOHN'STHUNDR between horses early,
stalked off the inside hen outside a rival on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. VASARIANO saved ground chasing the
pace throughout and did not rally. THREEARCHBAYMAFIA dueled outside the winner, bid again alongside that one midway on the turn and weakened in
the drive. WESTERN SMOKE chased outside a rival then off the rail, continued alongside a foe leaving the turn and also weakened.

Footnotes
SWAMP SOUFFLE angled in and saved ground off the pace, came out in upper stretch, rallied between horses under vigorous handling and a left handed
crack of the whip to get up outside foes late. THE CREEP between horses early, stalked outside a rival then just off the rail, bid alongside the pacesetter on
the second turn, took short lead in midstretch, drifted out a bit from the whip in deep stretch and held second between foes. TEQUILA JOE saved ground
stalking the pace, cut the corner into the stretch, split rivals in deep stretch and finished well. KYLEMORE hopped some at the break, stalked three deep
then outside a rival, continued outside on the second turn and three wide into the stretch and continued willingly to be edged for the show. CABIN JOHN
saved ground stalking the pace, came out in upper stretch, was between horses in midstretch then steadied between foes in tight in deep stretch. TOUGH
IT OUT broke a bit slowly, angled in and saved ground off the pace, came out some in deep stretch and split rivals late. START A RUNNIN sped to the early
lead, angled in on the first turn and set the pace inside, dueled on the second turn, fought back in the stretch and weakened some late. REAL MASTER
(FR) saved ground stalking the pace, came out leaving the second turn and into the stretch and was outfinished. KING EDDIE chased between foes then
outside a rival, came out leaving the second turn and four wide into the stretch and could not quite summon the needed late kick. RIGOLETTO (SWI) pulled
and came out off heels into the first turn, chased outside a rival, angled four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally.
