Footnotes
FUN SUCKER clear sailing today from outside to the lead, made all the pace and held sway to the wire. LUCKY AT JUSTICE chased winner throughout to
no avail while well clear of rest. TUDOX LIFTING OFF tracking inside most of the way with no late kick in the drive. DON'T HOLD QUEENS bottled up a bit
first turn, cleared backstretch, only improved. MORTY raced evenly with a inside trip. MAGIC FEET never a factor. RIDDLEMEREE never menaced.
SHAMELESSFI close to rail with a clean trip, no excuse. BANG through after half, dropped back.

Footnotes
BIZZY RIDE coasted to the front to set all pace while in hand to the stretch and geared down as much the best. MY SWEET BABOO good position to turn,
took up chase to no avail in the stretch while best of the rest. BOLD ADVENTURE chased winner to the stretch, weakened in the lane. BATTALSTOWN no
speed throughout, floated five wide past quarter pole and moved up while no real threat. DIME DROPPER had a steady fade. EDISON FIRE through early
and never a real factor thereafter. PLAYFUL HUNTER failed to menace. SPIKEANDBOWL rank after the start and never close after a delay in the paddock.
DR. ALBERT flashed brief foot to the turn but gave way readily. FLINT outrun.
