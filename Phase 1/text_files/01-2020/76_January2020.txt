Footnotes
CAPTAIN FROST away well, established control in short order, moved over towards the inside route, was well rated showing the way on a
loosely-contested lead, spaced at a slight distance from off the rail, looked to be in charge spinning into the lane, drew out to a commanding lead lightly
ridden from upper to around the sixteenth pole before completing the race basically under his power afterwards. EDEN RIDGE took up the chase from near
the two path, angled four wide into the lane, gained some ground on a winner not being asked for much run itself in the final sixteenth. IMMUNITY settled at
the back of the pack after stumbling at the start, was three wide departing the backstretch, got roused in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, was sent out
into path seven from upper to midlane, went on to secure the show. SEVEN LILIES pursued the top from path two, in between foes to the five-sixteenths
pole, stepped into the stretch and backed away readily. EKATI WILDCAT came up empty off a ground-saving journey. PURIMETER travelled two to three
wide on the turn, came under a ride by the five-sixteenths marker, ventured into the lane and folded.

Footnotes
PETALITE established the front and showed the way in hand from the four path uncontested and as the rider pleased, tucked to the two path half a mile
from home, remained patiently handled until angled six wide into upper stretch, got roused straightened away and edged clear under a drive to prevail.
FLATTERING EYES five wide in aim of the leader down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
went seven wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home well clear of the rest to be along second best. DANCING SLIPPERS six paths off the
inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and had the rider lose the handle on
the whip to the off side just outside the three-eighths pole, went eight wide into upper stretch, weakened while just procuring the show honors on the wire.
LA RUBIA chased two to three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch,
weakened just missing for the show honors. MAGICAL ROMANCE broke in at the start, chased four wide down the backstretch and then two to three wide
through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went five wide for home and made no impact.

Footnotes
CAN U HANDLE THIS stalked the pace from along the outside, going about the task primarily from the three path, increased her presence as the half was
being completed, spun into the lane, ventured on to the three-sixteenths pole and got turned loose, fought its way to a slim advantage during the remainder
of the trip leading up to the eighth pole, was under aim from SHESASUPERFREAK the entire final furlong, dug in stubbornly to prevail.
SHESASUPERFREAK underwent a three wide pursuit, narrowed in after the half had been rattled off, settled in at the three-sixteenths pole and was put to
stronger handling, began the last eighth fully engaged with the winner, fought with willingness thereafter but got staved off. BUSTIN SCONES was
maneuvered to the outside proceeding along the backstretch, took up the chase approximately four wide on the turn, swung into the lane, got steadied
shying into path six in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, reacting to the antics of KITTY THERAPY at that juncture, recovered then rallied with
belated energy for the show. MOON HEIST grabbed a narrow advantage after the field had been sent on its way, was in the two path showing the way,
attended by the winner from the outside, got set down approaching the three-sixteenths pole, succumbed when challenged a sixteenth later, steadily
weakened. KITTY THERAPY stumbled in an awkward manner at the start, went on stride after being gathered by the pilot and dove onto the inside route,
tracked the front runners, for the most part without benefit of being covered up, came under a brisk hand ride at the end of the bend, ducked out several
paths when fed some left side pressure right around the three-sixteenths pole, had no rally afterwards. MINIT MAUS took up the chase four wide on the
turn, with the rider encouraging the mount along, got sent out seven wide from upper to midstretch, lacked a response and backed away.

Footnotes
HOUSE LIMIT remained forwardly placed after an alert getaway, tucked into the two path prior to arriving at the end of the homestretch, rated kindly stalking
the pacesetter and would continue to do so until late on the second bend, got roused spinning into the stretch, shifted one path wider in response to SUPER
SILVER having done so himself, took over soon afterwards, kicked away in the last eighth. DANNY CALIFORNIA sat strung out three wide on both turns,
swung towards path four for entrance into the stretch, failed to threaten the winner while rallying for the place. SUPER SILVER off the inside heading for the
clubhouse bend, worked his way onto the inside route shortly after stepping onto that turn, carved out the pace, rated and with HOUSE LOMIT in
accompaniment from path two, ventured onward under the same set-up all the way to the quarter pole, was set down coming up to that station, went into the
the two path stepping onto the top of the lane, relinquished for good a few strides later, weakened into the show slot. SPECTATOR SPORT along the
outside throughout, swung three wide onto the backstrretch, was yet as wide departing it, got angled out five wide for the drive home, lacked a solid closing
punch. JEROME AVENUE remained stationed along the rail after the field had been released, fought the bit getting steadied early on the first turn as
SUPER SILVER was itself cutting over to the rail after having assumed control, kept an eye on that opponent from the pocket, was let loose in the vicinity of
the five-sixteenths pole, cut the corner into the lane and faltered. RUN FOR BOSTON away the tardiest after making contact with the starting gate, moved
into the two path early after entering the backstretch after being closer to the inside route prior, travelled around the far turn under a drive, made no
headway, stepped into the lane and backed away.

handled until nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home set down for the drive, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held
well to prevail. BIG ENGINE coaxed from the gate, raced three wide in pursuit under coaxing from the three-eighths, went three to four wide into upper

Footnotes
MUSICAL AMERICA away in good order, took up position in the three path, stalked the pace as the outermost of the three front runners during the run
around the bend, turned into the lane clinging to a bare lead, settled in at the head of the stretch and was turned loose, out-dueled the runner up during the
tussle that following then edged away in the last sixteenth. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS disputed the pace from the two path, saw the winner increase its
presence as three-quarters was being completed, was put to a drive as a duel with the MUSICAL AMERICA commenced, left the sixteenth marker as the
vanquished one, stayed on well to save second. FELIX IN FABULA along the outside throughout, pursued the pace two to three wide on the turn, was put to
a drive midpoint on the turn, angled five wide into the lane, straightened away and mustered up a mild response, sufficient enough for the show award.
PLAYTHATFUNNYMUSIC tracked the pace from along the inside route for the opening six furlongs, went three wide into stretch, had no rally.
PROSCHEMA settled in at the back of the pack after the start, raced three to four wide on the turn, as the widest of all, fanned out into path six from upper
to midstretch, venturing onward as the widest of all, made no impact. MAJID contended for the top from along the inside for nearly three-quarters and gave
way.

Footnotes
SAN JUAN DIEGO five then four wide in pursuit from mid pack, advanced through the turn issuing a challenge placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole,
got set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, took over command straightened away, edged clear under a drive kept to task. LATIN LOVE BUG broke
in rank at the start tossing his head and bumping FLAT RATE in tandem with FLEET WARRIOR, got taken in hand as the rider regained balance and
conceded five to six lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased briefly six paths off the inside before tucking to the four path, chased four wide
through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to close in and secure the place honors
showing good courage after a rough start. FLAT RATE bumped between foes at the start who each broke his way, chased four then three wide from just off
the pace, advanced to take command placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in and was displaced from the front
straightened away, weakened in the late stages and just preserved the show honors on the wire. FLEET WARRIOR broke out at the start bumping FLAT
RATE in tandem with LATIN LOVE BUG, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and kept on to
just miss for the show honors. STRATEGIC OUTLOOK dueled inside of ROCKIN JO early on before emerging with sole command at the nine-sixteenths,
remained inside through the turn coming under pressure from FLAT RATE midway on the turn, came under coaxing and yielded command at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. ARI'S NAUGHTY LUCA chased six then five wide in the overland route throughout, came under a
ride at the three-eighths, went six wide for home and made no impact. ROCKIN JO coaxed from the gate, dueled from the two path with STRATEGIC
OUTLOOK to his inside, began to be shaken off at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing seven-sixteenths from home, faded and went four wide into
upper stretch, then tired in the drive. LE GROS BILL chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, cornered just off the inside into upper
stretch and was unable to make an impact.
