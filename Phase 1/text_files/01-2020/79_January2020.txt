Footnotes
DREAMER'S MOON set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid from EMPRESS OF FORTUNE, responded when asked and drew clear, driving.
EMPRESS OF FORTUNE stumbled at the start, stalked two wide, chased on the turn, made a bid at the quarter pole, then dug in gamely late to hold
second. YELLOW CHICK raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the turn, rallied inside in the final furlong and needed a bit more for second.
TERPEYE chased outside and weakened. POSSEINEFFECTTOO raced off the pace inside and had no rally. STAY SALTY raced two wide off the pace and
did not factor. SEPTEMBER BREEZE raced off the pace, failed to respond and gave way.

Footnotes
MISS STAR LO set pace in the three path, repulsed challenges near stretch and then slowly edged away through the stretch. BERBERSLILBRIEBRIE was
three wide early, went between foes and challenged near stretch but was unable to match strides late. VELOCITA BRILLANTE didn't break sharply, raced
two wide, steadied in tight on the far turn, drifted out through stretch and was too late. FRISKY WHISKEY broke slowly, raced three wide on the turn, angled
in stretch to avoid drifting out foe. MISSES KNIGHT prompted the pace racing wide then faded. LUCKY MEETING raced wide and failed to be a serious
threat. SHE'S RUNNING FREE, outside, offered a mild bid on the turn then gave way. CIAO LUNA saved ground just off the pace then tired. I'M THIRSTY,
four wide dueling for the early lead, tired. WISE TRADE broke slowly and showed nothing. MAKEYOURSELFATHOME was two wide and just off the pace,
stopped.

Footnotes
DIAGONAL set the pace racing with a clear lead, drew off on the far turn, then was kept to the task through the final furlong. SHILOH LANE raced off the
pace, advanced inside on the far turn, closed well in the lane but second best. LITTLE TOWN BLUES was bumped at the start, steadied leaving the far turn,
raced off the pace, three wide on the far turn and rallied mildly for third. ASBURY AVE raced off the pace between foes, failed to threaten and bested the
others. MARNESIA ONE STEP was bumped, then clipped heels and stumbled after the start, had the rider lose the irons, recovered them on the first turn,
then raced off the pace inside and had no rally. BOURBONATBOYLESBAR stalked the pacesetter, lacked a bid and faded. BRIDLECREST raced four wide
early, settled three wide and failed to threaten. LUSTY DUDE raced off the pace and did not factor. NONNO PIETRO raced three wide early, then stalked
outside and gave way.

C C'S CUP OF TEA set the pace in the four path, shook loose leaving the turn and was fully extended to the end. CORN OFF THE COB raced very wide
and was just up for place. HERAWAY came in and bumped with CARDI G leaving the gate, raced between foes while just off the pace then faded.
PRINCESS ARENI saved ground just off the pace then tired. CAWAJA TIME raced wide and dropped back. TRUNK OF MONEY stalked the early pace
outside winner then tired. CARDI G came out and contributed to the bumping at the start, saved ground and failed to menace. AMANDASROMEO, very
wide, had only brief speed. DANCINGTHEHNYDAWAY showed nothing.

Footnotes
WON AND DONE vied three wide between rivals for the early lead, gained a short lead, dueled with RED RAZZO passing the quarter pole, responded when
roused and pulled away under urging in the final sixteenth. RED RAZZO was a bit reluctant loading, stalked the pace, bid on the turn, dueled with the winner
and came up second best. COZY LOVER broke in bumping hard with rivals at the start, raced off the pace, three wide on the turn and rallied mildly inside.
LONG MAY YOU RUN stumbled at the start and was bumped hard, had the rider lose the irons, recovered them nearing the half mile marker, then tracked
inside, two wide on the turn and bested the others. BOLITA BOYZ stalked three wide, raced four wide on the turn and lacked a rally. SOUTH SEA was
bumped hard at the start and pinched back, raced off the pace, off the rail, five wide on the turn and flattened out. JW'STRICKYMISCHIEF vied between
rivals, then chased two wide on the turn and faded. NAVY COMMANDER vied inside for the lead, chased inside on the turn and faded. INFURIATED raced
close up four wide, then chased and gave way. After a Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey Objection by the rider of LONG MAY YOU RUN against COZY
LOVER, the race was declared official.

Footnotes
MEADE stalked the pace three wide, engaged for the lead in early stretch and was all out to prevail. FINAL SHOT set the pace in the four path, resisted
gamely and held on tenaciously. BOJINGLE, just off the rail early, swung to the outside entering stretch and lacked a strong closing kick. LAZARUS
PROJECT, racing just off the rail, went between foes on turn, drifted out racing into stretch and finished evenly. HALITE broke slowly and raced very wide.
IMPACTFUL saved ground just off the pace then faded. TACTICAL PURSUIT (IRE), between foes, failed to be a serious threat. BLACK LIGHT, outside
early, went between foes on turn and then tired. EVIL MONKEY, wide, dropped back steadily. ASK CHUCK also raced wide and had only brief speed. YES
IT'S BONIFIDE stopped suddenly and lost contact.
