Footnotes
ALLGORILLA took over from WALK UP MUSIC through the stretch the first time, rated along slightly off the inside to the stretch, and remained clear under
pressure in the two-path. WALK UP MUSIC led through the opening stages before letting ALLGORILLA go on with it, tracked under a firm hold up the
backstretch, cut into the margin looming a threat outside the leader the far turn, shifted inside for the drive and made no further gain. MAGIC STREET raced
two wide most of the way, and lacked a solid late response in an even effort. FAKE MUSE went evenly through a ground-saving trip, and failed to threaten.
MAVERICK KITTEN was keyed up heading to the first turn three wide, went along in the middle of the field swinging four wide at the top of the lane, and
made no headway. SMIRK bumped with ALEJANDRO'S TEAM at the start, trailed early inside, angled widest into the stretch and could not reach
contention. PAINTSVILLE bumped with ALEJANDRO'S TEAM at the start, and was outrun inside. ALEJANDRO'S TEAM was bumped between
PAINTSVILLE and SMIRK at the start, and was always well back. BAD BEAT BRIAN was three wide early, and showed little.

Footnotes
QUEEN KANTHAROS was forwardly positioned in opening stages and raced in tracking mode off the pacesetter, moved up the inside and took control over
the lead late turn, widened to a clear advantage and held firm under steady urging. DIXIELAND HUMOR raced widest off the early speed then switched in a
few paths moving through the turn, was set down for the drive along the outside, closed with response and finished clearly second best. BULLDAT got
bumped at the start then advanced to race near midrange in the backstretch, hustled up through the turn then stayed on two wide through the lane and
secured share. UPSY DAISY DO bumped a bit at the start then raced five wide off the early speed, hustled along under steady pressure around the turn,
continued a bid racing wide in the lane and improved position without threatening. EVELIA broke on top and established the early lead, continued to set the
pace then got collared by winner late turn and gave way. VARSOVIA raced in contention under steady urging, was put to a drive mid-turn, kept on four wide
at head of the lane then weakened in final furlong. HOLLY HILL got bumped then bobbled and lost ground at the start, saved ground into stretch and lacked
a needed rally. SNAKE N SHAKE hustled along and raced in range through the backstretch then gave way around the turn. TRINNI SUNSET showed
interest in opening quarter then faltered throughout. MOON OVER MAUI saved ground and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
ALIEN INVASION broke on top and was quickly in command, rated along inside unbothered for six furlongs, got set down through upper stretch and
widened the advantage, and was geared down the last 70 yards. KING ORB lagged well back for a half-mile, began moving along the inside on the far turn,
circled four wide rallying into the stretch, and finished willingly while not a threat to the winner. PADDY O'DINI hugged the rail innermost of a trio chasing
after the pacesetter, could not gain under pressure approaching the stretch, and was outfinished for second. SMALL HOPE lost his footing at the start,
lacked room between horses heading to the first turn, raced in the two-path and could not threaten. GINS AND TINS got pushed out by COULD BE at the
start, had his heels clipped by the same rival soon after entering the backstretch, chased between horses to the top of the stretch, and faded steadily.
COULD BE broke out at the start, steadied along rank between PADDY O'DINI and GINS AND TINS on the first turn, clipped the latter's heels and bobbled
entering the backstretch, moved out three wide staying on the chase to the end of the far turn, and gave way. BILLY BIG (IRE) lunged at the start, raced
three wide and was finished early. CROWN TO THE GOLD showed nothing at the back of the field.

Footnotes
CABRE was the closest pursuer of the pacesetter through early stages then headed in pursuit around the turn, reached equal terms for the lead turning for
home then roused forward to clear command, drifted out under left handed pressure then straightened out and stayed sharp. TAYLORSINITIATION raced
along the inside and tracked the top two leaders then launched a bid around the turn, was set down driving five to six wide in stretch run and nipped foe for
place. WHY TRUST broke readily and established the early lead, continued to lead the way then got collared by winner late turn, kept on with response
under steady pressure and got nipped for place in final stride. REVOLVING STAR raced six wide in the back through early stages, continued reserved
around the turn, stayed along the outside under steady prompting in stretch run and improved position without threatening. BULLGRATS was not too far off
the early pace then failed to move on when called upon entering the turn, stayed under steady pressure in the lane and had no kick. FREE FLAYME
showed response in early stages then retreated.

Footnotes
GLORIOUS GAL went up to vie for command inside TRINNI FLOWER on the first turn, bested that one on the far turn while being joined by GALIT JAK,
shook off that one into the stretch and widened under pressure. BIG BOSS LADY was off a beat slow, steadied on the rail under a firm hold behind the
leaders late on the first turn, moved outside GLORIOUS GAL seemingly locked and loaded at the top of the lane, had the rider lost the whip passing the
eighth-pole and was second best. BUNNY PRINCESS trailed three wide early before moving inside, came off the rail midway around the far turn finding
stride, and rallied on the far outside to get the show. MARICOPA broke outward spotting the field a length or two, settled in midpack early four wide, moved
inward rallying into the stretch, but weakened late. PUKALANI saved ground coming under a ride through the far turn, but could not quicken as needed.
GALIT JAK had her back feet slip out from under her going to the first turn four wide, lodged a bid in the three-path on the far turn, but faded into the stretch.
LUCKYTOHAVEMYVICKI was in tight quarters three wide between horses into the first turn, remained in the three-path and gave way before reaching the
stretch. BEE WINGS was in traffic two wide into the first turn, swung out four wide on the far turn and was empty. TERRIBLE TARA checked sharply
between horses into the first turn and bore out well past the middle of the course, remained wide and tired after a half-mile. TRINNI FLOWER vied for
command outside the winner for a half, and dropped back on the far turn.

Footnotes
GOLDEN NOLE cleared on top and angled closer to inside in opening stages, continued on top and held firm around the turn, was put to a drive two wide
entering top stretch, continued with a narrow lead a furlong out then kept on determinedly under pressure and held on. PROBABLY GRACE was off a step
slow at the start and lacked early speed, hustled along two wide entering top stretch then shifted out wider, kept on with response and steadily gained on the
winner. SUE'S MONSTER BABY raced three deep in the flight off the leader, launched a bid for command around the turn, raced in striking distance a
furlong out then yielded in final stages. SECRET MISS raced inside and tracked the early leader, remained forwardly positioned and patiently handled
around the turn, was given cue along the rail entering top stretch, raced in striking range near the furlong marker then flattened out. ONEZY'S DREAM
raced off the early pace and saved ground around the turn then came under steady urging and failed to move on. FIAMMA MAMMA raced between foes
tracking the leader through early stages then lost position moving through the turn and offered no late rally. SHADDAY raced off the second flight at the half
mile marker, hustled up four wide around the turn but failed to advance position then faded in the lane.

Footnotes
GO POKE THE BEAR lagged far back for six furlongs in the two-path, shifted four wide getting in gear late on the far turn, advanced through a seam
between horses in upper stretch and closed strongly to get up outside rivals. KING OF SPADES settled in the second flight early, crept closer awaiting an
opening with a quarter-mile remaining, came clear in the three-path into the lane, rallied gamely between horses late and just missed. GAUGUIN (GER)
bumped with THE MIGHTY JUDGE at the start, raced in midpack for six furlongs, was stacked five wide into the far turn, moved in a bit challenging outside
the leaders at the top of the stretch, reached the front through the furlong grounds and ran on with good courage inside the top two. SHORE MAGIC was
well back two wide for six furlongs, swung further out turning for home, and was up outside for a share while being carefully handled in the final yards.
MANTRA saved ground outrun through the initial stages, waited behind a wall of horses on the fence turning for home, rallied smartly gaining some
clearance through the furlong grounds in the two-path, and encountered late traffic. GOLDEN DECISION broke alertly despite an awkward first step,
prompted the pace outside DISCOVERED, bid between horses past the quarter-pole, dueled through upper stretch on the rail and weakened past the
eighth-pole. RESIDENT LIBERAL saved ground in range early, slipped through on the rail looming a threat turning for home, but was outkicked. IM THE
CAPTAIN NOW hit the left side of the gate at the start, recovered to a forward position, issued a mild four-wide challenge into the lane, but flattened out.
THE MIGHTY JUDGE bumped with GAUGUIN at the start, and was outrun through a four-wide trip. LAHINCH tracked the leaders three wide, advanced
with a mild bid into the far turn, but faltered into the lane. DISCOVERED established a moderate pace slightly off the rail, and was swarmed from both flanks
leaving the far turn. DUC DE CALAS (FR) broke slowly and was never a factor.

Footnotes
FAST PASS was allowed to settle out of the gate and continued unhurried through early stages, came under turning for home, responded willingly along the
far outside and rallied to clear command. BORDINI raced in range through early stages, hustled up around the turn then kept on five wide in the lane and
edged foe to take place. TRAVY BOY held a slim lead through early stages then vied for the lead racing inside of WHYRUAWESOME around the turn,
continued to battle back into stretch run then failed to be a match when the winner rallied by in late stages. WHYRUAWESOME was forwardly placed in
opening stages and prompted the pace, advanced to race on equal terms around the turn, continued to battle with TRAVY BOY at the furlong marker then
had no left in late reserve. STARSHIP REINA tracked the top two leaders then headed In pursuit around the turn, continued a steady bid upper stretch then
came up empty in final furlong. HE'S SMOKIN HOT lacked early foot and raced near the back, raced three wide under a ride at head of the lane but failed to
respond.

Footnotes
EBULLIENT broke out bumping solidly with FRITZI at the start, took over three wide into the first turn and moved inside after a sharp first quarter-mile, rolled
along widening the margin steadily, was put to a drive into the stretch and remained well clear. SMOOTH WITH A KICK was under a snug hold in some
early traffic, swung four wide off the far turn and found her best stride late to get second outside foes. ZABAVA was three wide early, stayed well back for six
furlongs, rallied through midstretch and just missed the place between horses. CLAIRVOYANCE hugged the rail in the second flight to the stretch, remained
inside rallying through the furlong grounds, but did not have enough. UNCHAINED (IRE) chased the winner to the stretch toward the inside, and weakened
in the two-path through the drive. SOUL SPIRIT saved ground far back for six furlongs, angled to the far outside into the stretch and improved belatedly.
BAREEQA was outrun to the stretch inside, continued on the fence and steadied lacking room a sixteenth out. I AM MAGICAL (GB) raced mostly four wide
on the turns, and lacked the needed response. SHIKAKA was forwardly placed toward the inside for six furlongs, and weakened in the two-path through the
lane. BIG TINA raced four wide early, and never became a factor. INDICIA was far back throughout. FRITZI absorbed a hard bump from EBULLIENT at the
start, chased that one early three wide, and faltered after six furlongs.

Footnotes
OSAKA GIRL was off to a good start and secured inside position in opening stages, stalked the pace down the backstretch then remained patiently piloted
along inside around the far turn, switched out a path and put to a drive at head of the lane, responded and drew clear. LA BABIA sped to the lead and
crossed over to the inside in opening stages, set the pace through the backstretch and continued on top around the far turn, roused for more upper stretch,
stayed on with response but could not hold off the winner. MRS. S rated near midpack along the outside through early stages, picked up the pace around
the far turn then continued a five wide bid and captured share. LOOKINTOGETLUCKY was unhurried and raced in the back, picked up the pace late turn
then swung to the outside, shifted out wider under left handed pressure with a furlong left to run and improved late. HAPPY BEE was forwardly placed and
raced just off the leader down the backstretch, raced two wide in aim for the lead at the quarter pole then flattened in final furlong and finished evenly.
LIPSTIKLIESNLOVERS was unhurried and saved ground down the backstretch, picked up the pace and angled out late far turn then shifted back to the
inside for the final furlong and needed more for late impact. STAND TALL bumped with rival just after the start then steadied going by the wire for the first
time, took back off the pace and remained reserved through the backstretch, hustled up for response at the head of the lane, shifted out wider in final furlong
and passed tiring foes. LUCKY POLLY stalked the top two leaders down the backstretch, raced between foes and launched a bid around the far turn then
gave way in stretch run. MISS ADVENTURE settled and saved ground through early stages, came under a ride along the rail around the far turn then faded
in the lane. JUST SMOK'N bumped with rival just after the start then steadied entering the first turn, tracked the early pace, prompted two wide around the
far turn then faded. CHOOSE TO BE HAPPY settled off the early pace and failed to respond when called upon in the final turn. MISS CHEENY raced along
the outside not too far off the early pace then gave way around the far turn.
