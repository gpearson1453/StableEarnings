saved second. LEGALLY GRAY had no speed to the turn, was fanned four wide on the turn, swung widest for the drive then failed to switch leads in the

ZIPPIN WINE had the best speed, eased in and set the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded to edge clear to mid stretch and held on stubbornly.
GIMME SPACE had no speed, settled to the half, raced two then three wide to the stretch and finished in a mild rally. MR. PAPAS tracked the pace to the
second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then was outfinished for second. WHEN JESUS WALKED broke a bit slow but
pressed the winner for six furlongs two wide then got outrun to mid stretch and finished evenly. LOUIE THE GAMBLER also was away a bit slow, had no
speed, got fanned four wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. CLASSIC CHAMP settled mid pack to the second turn, had to
circle four wide to the stretch and came up empty in the drive.

RUN HEAT broke alertly, set the pace from the rail to the stretch, edged away to mid stretch then held under steady urging. BACKSTREET'S BACK was
outsprinted to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch then finished willingly and gamely bested CAPTAIN FURY after being brushed in mid stretch by that
one. CAPTAIN FURY The latter tracked the winner from the rail to the stretch, shifted off the rail, came out slightly in mid stretch, brushed the runnerup then
battled that one for the place and just missed. NEXTPORTOFCALL was outrun to the turn, swung out four wide into the stretch but could not make an
impact in the drive. CODE GRAY was also outsprinted to the turn, had to circle five deep on the turn, closed the gap to the line but did not menace. PAPA
SUGAR was chasing the leader from the rail to the stretch then weakened. TEXAS BOB had no speed and was not a factor. CYCLOTOM pressed the
winner in the opening quarter, gave way on the turn and stopped in the drive.

ARCH PRINCE pressed the pace to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch, responded when set down for the drive and finished determinedly to
prevail. BAM BAM BRYAN was sent for speed, set the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then could not hold off the winner. MORE
POWER TO HIM trailed to the second turn, swung out four wide into the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. ANGELO'S PRIDE was allowed to
settle for a half mile, saved ground on the second turn, rallied to loom boldly in mid stretch but could not sustain the needed response. CUPID'S CLAWS
chased the pace outside the winner to the second turn, made a run three wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly.

SPLASHING trailed to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch then responded when set down, closed determinedly and won by a whisker.
MULHIMA (IRE) set all the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then dug in gamely but was nailed in the final jump. LADY PHYLLIS
stalked the pace to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch then finished willingly and just missed. PURE PERFECTION was allowed to settle to the
half, saved ground on the second turn then was outfinished in the final furlong. MARJORIE E pressed the pace two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid
stretch and finished evenly. NONNA GIANNA (IRE) was settled to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch but could not offer the needed late

MY FRIEND TONY was quickest and set the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded when set down and held under steady urging. RUSH pressed the
winner two wide to the stretch, could not make an impact on that one but dug in to save the place. MIDNIGHT DESTINY chased the pace from the rail to the
stretch, briefly loomed a threat to mid stretch then flattened out. MORE HONOR had no speed, trailed two wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late
response. SKELTON PASS also chased to the turn, was three wide to the stretch then weakened in the drive.

FRIDAY'S AT SHADY settled mid pack to the half, was off the rail on the second turn, eased out into the stretch for room, rallied when set down and closed
steadily to prevail. I DECLARE WAR set all the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then could not stall the winner but held second.
JIMMY G trailed to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then picked off rivals in the drive. ARCH ANTHEM had no speed, settled to the second turn,
got fanned out to the four path to the stretch, swung out widest for the drive but went evenly late. ARMOUR PLATE pressed the pace to the second turn,
raced two wide to the stretch but tired after six furlongs. MAGIC RATE stalked the pace inside a rival, saved ground to the stretch but also tired in the drive.
UNLAWFUL ACT was chasing to the half, raced three wide to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
PREMIUM FOREST trailed to the second turn, swung out five wide into the stretch, responded when set down and made a stout run to be along in time.
SITH LORD set all the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then could not hold off the winner but held second. ERNIE BANKS never
far back to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch then was outfinished. ELDRITCH (IRE) had no speed, settled to the
half mile pole, raced off the rail to the stretch then had to shift out for room in the drive and finished willingly. SHOT OF A LIFETIME tracked the pace to the
second turn, saved ground to the stretch but could not muster the needed late response. UPO angled in to save room, settled to the second turn, remained
inside to the stretch then tried to slip through a narrow opening but was crowded, checked briefly and finished evenly. NO NAME FRED was four wide to the
backstretch, settled to the second turn then was caught four deep to the stretch and lacked a closing bid. ON RAGLAN ROAD pressed the pace two wide
for six furlongs then was outrun to mid stretch and weakened. READY SAY GO chased the leader to the second turn while two wide but gave way in the
drive.

REBALATION was outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the stretch, found an opening inside of DARLING DEMON, rallied through on the rail and won
driving. FREE BELIEF attended the pace three wide to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then was collared late but saved the place. SUNBLESSED
(IRE) trailed to the turn, raced three wide then swung out widest for the drive and closed steadily but too late. SHE'S SO PRETTY was chasing to the turn,
got fanned four wide to the stretch then was forced to steady when ROCKETANN drifted into her path in mid stretch and finished evenly. ROCKETANN
contested the pace two wide to the stretch, was being outrun in upper stretch, shifted out then drifted further out in mid stretch, was straightened but
weakened. DARLING DEMON tracked the leaders to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then was also being outrun and had to check away from
ROCKETANN in mid stretch and weakened. ST. ANNIE'S INDY was settled to the turn, raced off the rail to the stretch then was caught in tight quarters in
mid stretch, steadied and came up empty. SUGAR CRUSH chased the pace three wide to the stretch, was squeeezed off between rivals in mid stretch, took
up sharply and lost any chance.
