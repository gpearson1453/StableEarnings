Footnotes
MORNING PRINCESS broke readily to race on terms with the leaders, then was rated while dropping off the first flight between foes to the turn, shifted out
four wide nearing upper stretch and continued to advance under right, then left handed urging to prevail in time. DARLINDIVA, in touch with the leaders
three deep prompting the pace to the turn, pressed the issue between foes inside the winner into upper stretch but came up second best. DO WHAT IT
TAKES angled to the rail early gaining a position just off the pacesetter, pressed that foe racing into the turn and weakened inside the top pair late. WEST
HORIZEN tracked off the first flight along the flight inside, angled out in upper stretch but had no rally. MANCORA tracked off the first flight racing four wide
to the turn and faded early. CONGRATS GOLDA was urged to the lead in the opening stages while shifting off the rail, dueled between foes into the turn
and gave way nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
THE GODDESS LYSSA ducked out slightly at the start, moved to force the pace outside a rival, went clear racing into the turn, held sway on a commanding
advantage into the stretch and widened late in a ridden out effort. BAHAMA PEARL, urged inside the eventual winner disputing the pace in the opening
stages, lost ground when proving no match foe that foe racing into the turn but held a rival for the place honors. TAKE TO THE SKIES tracked off the first
flight from out of striking distance to the turn, was urged to advance three deep nearing the turn making some brief progress but lacked the needed closing
bid. MYSTICAL EMPATH brushed the gate while breaking slowly, settled last early and never gained contention. WHIPPY CREAM tracked the leaders from
out of striking distance inside inside a rival in the opening stages but retreated early. SIENA'S TICKET and FLAMING INDY were each scratched at the gate
after dislodging their riders prior to the start.

Footnotes
PROPOSITION broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail, went clear into upper stretch and widened the margin in a handy
effort. NAUGHTY SHIRLEY stumbled at the start, quickly recovered to track just off the pacesetter along the inside racing into the turn, couldn't maintain
terms with that foe into the stretch but proved clearly best of the others. TOLLY HO, in touch three deep in the opening stages prompting the pacesetter,
weakened nearing upper stretch but continued with interest to hold a rival for a share. G Q GIRL hopped at the start, recovered to track off the second flight
between foes to the turn, was urged to advance while angling to the inside nearing upper stretch and finished evenly late. DREAMING DIAMONDS tracked
off the first flight four wide racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. TRUE ATKA settled off the second flight along the inside in the opening
stages and offered no rally. HEATHER HILLS dropped back early. ADONAI BLESS tracked off the second flight between foes but soon gave way.

Footnotes
SNOW LION was rated along the inside tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, advanced smartly along the rail when given his cue after a half,
switched outside the pacesetter to wrest command on the far turn and went well clear under right handed pressure. MIKE MIKE, urged to the lead along the
rail, shook clear into the backstretch, dictated the pace to the far turn, proved no match when confronted by the winner. G FRIDAY, bumped at the start,
angled to the inside tracking well off the second flight, shifted out on the backstretch, angled back to the rail on the far turn and improved position inside foes
to the end. KIKI N KING tracked the pacesetter near the inside to the backstretch and steadily faded on the far turn. HOMERS MAGIC, reluctant to load,
hopped at the start, settled between foes but made an effort to improve his position near the inside into the stretch. I HAVE HOPE broke inwards bumping G
FRIDAY, was urged to a contending position four wide into the first turn, tracked the pacesetter outside foes and gave way racing through the far turn.
DRILL DOWN settled between foes early and offered no rally. EL QUERETANO settled outside foes to the backstretch and failed to menace. MY
COMPUTER proved no factor. MARIAHS CAT was urged to a forward placing three wide between foes racing to the first turn but was spent early.

Footnotes
ENDURING HONOR tracked the pacesetter just off the second flight racing three wide into the backstretch, was prompted to commence a steady advance
in that path racing into the far turn, wrested the advantage and drove clear. WILSHIRE STAR urged clear into the first turn to set the pace racing a bit off the
rail, held sway to the second bend, proved no match when confronted by the winner but was best of the others. TALK TO THE MEDIA tracked off the
second flight while angling inside, saved ground to upper stretch but had no final kick. SIX SIDED BLING settled near the inside in early stages, angled out
four wide racing into the stretch and displayed some late interest. SACRED LEGACY tracked the leader inside a rival as part of the second flight to the
backstretch, shifted out three wide entering the far turn and soon faded. PERFECT JOE, restless in the gate, broke a step slowly, settled outside rivals and
never gained contention. TO YOUR HEALTH proved no factor. NOBODY MOVE tracked the pacesetter outside a rival, then between foes in second flight
racing to the far turn and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
BARREL OF STOUT was settled last to the backstretch, circled foes four wide racing through the far turn, angled out five wide in upper stretch and
continued with a steady late response to edge MR. MAURICE under firm right handed pressure. The latter, bumped at the start, was rated off the second
flight along the inside, shifted out on the far turn to gain position three wide between foes and continued willingly between foes in that path to challenge for
command late while just outkicked. FINE SPIRIT, firmly rated four wide racing through the first turn as part of the second flight, gained position three deep
between foes racing into the far turn, angled to the rail racing into upper stretch to challenge inside the pacesetter but lacked the needed final kick. ZIGGY
BARCELONA broke inwards bumping a rival, went to the lead along the inside, disputed the pace inside a rival into the far turn, edged clear nearing upper
stretch but weakened between foes leaving midstretch. VINTNER, a bit washy, tracked the leaders between foes in second flight to the far turn and
continued evenly late. ROLLER ROLLS ON settled well off the field while angling in a bit, was prompted to advance racing into the far turn, was shuffled a
bit when caught in close quarters midway through the far turn and lacked any further closing response. READY TO MINGLE angled inwards to track
between foes in second flight racing to the first turn, shifted out four wide after a half while being prompted to advance, lodged a brief bid racing through the
far turn but proved empty in the drive. HUSBAND IN LAW, forwardly placed tracking just off the leaders near the inside racing to the far turn, emptied out
into the stretch. LUNCHEON, pulling a bit while exchanging some contact with KID DANGER in the opening stages, moved to terms prompting the
pacesetter into the backstretch and gave way racing into the far turn. KID DANGER exchanged some contact in the opening stages, was rated leading the
second flight on a narrow margin between foes into the backstretch and steadily faded racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
ACASEADAY broke sharply, angled inwards forcing the pace outside a rival to gain a narrow advantage, then held sway to the end racing a bit off the rail
while being kept to brisk right handed encouragement. WHITE DRILL, forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the pacesetter, continued with a steady
bid pursuing that foe into upper stretch but couldn't gain even terms while holding well for the place honors. MUST BE A MONSTER tracked off the first
flight along the inside in early, was taken up leaving the half mile marker, swung out four wide racing through the turn while being prompted to advance but
finished evenly in the last furlong. INITFORTHELOVE tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight, angled to the inside nearing upper stretch and
finished evenly late. PRETTY STORMY, urged along the inside prompting the pacesetter to the turn, gave way into upper stretch. NO LOOK BACK broke in
the air, angled to the inside racing into the turn but never gained striking distance. FIFTH OF NOVEMBER settled near the inside in early stages and failed
to menace. COMMANDER'S INTENT tracked just off the second flight between foes but soon dropped back. BABY BROTHER broke awkwardly, was
prompted to gain contention racing five wide to the turn and quickly emptied out.

Footnotes
HOPE AGAIN (GB) was rated stalking just off the first flight racing to the backstretch, came through inside the leaders when presented an opening in upper
stretch and went clear under firm left handed pressure. J BERESFORD TIPTON was guided to the inside avoiding some traffic nearing the first turn to track
off the second flight along the inside, saved ground gaining position nearing the lane, shifted out four wide approaching the furlong marker and proved best
of the others. GENTLEMAN JOE, urged to gain a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter, advanced to prompt the leader racing into the far turn,
dueled into the lane and weakened late. BREAK IN THE STORM, three deep between foes racing to the first turn, was clipped by THAT QUALITY while
forced out into the path of RED CAT (CHI) on the first turn, was collected to track off the second flight between foes to the far turn, continued with interest to
gain some position into the stretch, then was vanned off the course after the race. IRONWOOD, held up avoiding close quarters after the start, saved
ground throughout and passed inside some tiring rivals. MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY, urged to the lead along the inside, set the pace on a narrow margin for a
half, dueled for command on the far turn into upper stretch while shifting out and quickly came up empty. KING CAUSE, taken up avoiding traffic to race six
wide into the first turn, trailed the field to the far turn and made no real impression. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE tracked off the first flight between foes to the
backstretch but retreated early. RED CAT (CHI), forced wide racing into the first turn, recovered to track outside foes into the backstretch, was prompted to
make brief progress four wide into the far turn but emptied out early. THAT QUALITY, steadied in close quarters at the break, shifted out while rank between
foes racing to the first turn, bore out entering that bend making contact with BREAK IN THE STORM while impeding several others rivals, angled in nearing
the backstretch and soon dropped out.

SUSIES WHO broke readily to gain a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, continued with a steady bid racing into upper stretch
and wore down that rival in time to prevail under firm left handed pressure. DIVA DANA urged clear while angling inwards in the opening stages, dictated the
pace racing a bit off the rail to upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid but came up second best. V K LEGACY, unhurried outside foes tracking off the
second flight to the turn, was prompted to advance five wide on the turn to upper stretch and finished with interest to make a mild gain. LANGUE LIEE
tracked off the first flight four wide racing to the turn, was urged to make a brief bid in that path nearing the lane but flattened out late. GRANDMARY,
bumped, then pinched back at the start, tracked the leaders between rivals from out of striking distance and gained some position late while making no real
impression. SOCIALLY ASTRAY ducked outwards bumping GRANDMARY at the start, tracked off the second flight between foes to the turn and soon
faded. THIRSTYFORAMIRACLE, brushed at the break, settled between foes just off the inside and proved no threat. OLGA AGAIN broke outwards
brushing a rival, was urged in brief pursuit of the leaders along the inside but emptied out nearing the lane. AWESOME DREAM was outpaced early. BLUE
INDY, caught in close quarters at the start, dropped out early.

Footnotes
BEANTOWN BABY, forwardly placed five wide tracking just off the leaders, advanced four wide racing into the turn, shifted inwards while moving to gain the
advantage nearing upper stretch and held sway on a clear margin through the lane under firm right handed pressure. PINS AND NEEDLES tracked off the
first flight along the inside, shifted out into the lane to split foes and proved best of the others. SCOWLING RIDGE, urged in pursuit of the pacesetter three
wide between foes into the turn, steadied slightly midway through the bend, then continued with a steady effort but weakened in late stages. C. A. C.
CHAQUIRA tracked off the first flight outside foes, raced four wide to the stretch and gained some some position in an even effort. RANK AND FILE, off
awkwardly, was settled outside foes, ducked a bit while shifting inwards racing into upper stretch and gained some position between foes late.
OURHANDSOMEGAL hopped at the start, switched to the outside early and failed to menace. BROADWAY PEGGY ducked at the start, angled to the
inside chasing the leaders into the turn and soon emptied out. MISS MARGARET ANN, bumped at the start, was hustled between foes to gain the lead
along the inside racing into the turn but emptied out early. LADY MARVEL broke in the air, settled along the inside and never menaced thereafter. FOLLOW
ME MOM broke inwards bumping MISS MARGARET ANN and soon dropped out.
