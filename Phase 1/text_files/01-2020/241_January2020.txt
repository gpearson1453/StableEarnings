Footnotes
MADAM MEENA was hustled between rivals early, came in some nearing the end of the backstretch, was urged closer along the rail around the turn, took
over in early stretch then drew out just before five furlongs. UP JUST IN TIME was bumped leaving the gate, came in some soon after the break, moved
clear midway on the backstretch, stayed out from the rail around the turn then weakened after five furlongs. Following an objection by Gonzalez, UP JUST
IN TIME was disqualified and placed third. CULLINAN was fractious in the gate, ducked out into UP JUST IN TIME leaving the gate, steadied soon after
when that one came in, was sent two wide between rivals into the turn, steadied slightly behind the early leader leaving the three-eighths pole then
weakened in the lane. STEPH'S PRINCESS broke in the air then bobbled leaving the gate, came out some soon after, raced three wide between rivals into
the turn then tired. GRACE AND PEACE was hustled along the rail nearing the end of the backstretch, steadied then bobbled nearing the turn, fell back,
angled wide into the stretch and flattened out. ROMANTIC GIZMO wasn't far back while four wide into the turn then tired.

Footnotes
WILD WOOD NORTH bumped with an inner rival at the start, stalked the pace from along the inside through the turn, made a rail bid for the lead turning for
home as the leader left it vacated, then drove pas his rivals passing the furlong pole while hanging on his left lead. BYEBYE BYEBYE bumped with an outer
foe at the start, rushed through to a clear lead early on while staying in two path, drifted to the three path approaching the quarter pole as an outer rival
made a bid, but doing so left the rail open for the eventual winner turning for home, was headed by that foe passing the eighth pole and subsequently gave
way while holding place. REDREAMED chased four wide while under coaxing pressure, was put to an all out drive into the turn and made a bid for the lead
in the three path passing the five sixteenths pole, but was floated back to the four path turning for home and flattened out in upper stretch. VISHNU stalked
three wide between horses, but weakened around the turn. BEN'S ECLIPTICAL saved ground while trailing around the turn, but failed to get involved.
LACCO AMENO was a bit anxious waiting for the gates to open, then was off slowly while being driven when the did, settled off the pace in the four to five
path around the turn, and further weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
SAINT MICHAEL ducked out into SILVER STARSHIP leaving the gate, gained command soon after, stayed out from the rail once clear midway on the
backstretch and was kept to urging. SILVER STARSHIP was bumped into SUNSHINE SPERRY leaving the gate, was hustled between horses, came in,
bumped CHASING MY HALO early on the backstretch and again midway on the backstretch, raced two wide around the turn and couldn't gain through the
lane. NEGRITO came in leaving the gate, wasn't far back early while racing out from the inside, made a belated run between horses through the lane and
was up for the show. CHASING MY HALO was bumped twice while along the rail on the backstretch, advanced on the turn then bore out under left hand
whip through the lane. DA WINNER IS wasn't far back, raced five wide around the turn and lacked the needed closing. SATURDAYNITEAFFAIR had early
position between horses, raced three wide around the turn then bore out through the lane while tiring. ROGUE PATRIOT raced four wide between horses
and lacked a closing. SUNSHINE SPERRY was bumped and steadied leaving the gate, raced six wide around the turn and failed to menace. IT'S NOT
FUNNY chased early, raced four wide into the turn then tired.

FINAL PROSPECT was between horses in midpack in the three path, came under a drive to commence a rally passing the seven sixteenths pole, tipped
out and made a four wide bid for the lead outside of the leaders turning for home, then drove past his foes approaching the furlong pole. SOUTHSIDE
WARRIOR saved ground from midpack, rallied through a large opening along the rail in upper stretch, but got outkicked by the eventual winner while
gaining place passing the furlong pole, then dug in to hold that position to the wire. AIN'T MISBEHAVIN set the pace while being kept in the three path by an
inner rival, lost the lead to that foe into the far turn, but kept on and vied around that bend before being bested by an oncharging outer rival approaching the
furlong pole, then got outfinished for place. FED FEVER vied inside of the early leader, inched forward to grab the lead passing the seven sixteenths pole,
held a slight advantage around the far turn as his outer rival kept on, but weakened between horses passing the furlong pole. PAL CAL was no factor while
caught in the five path around both turns. CATTLE DRIVE stalked in the four path while rating nicely off of the leader's flank, but weakened around the far
turn and was eased up late. BUSTIN THE BANK saved ground while trailing and never got involved.

Footnotes
STUDIO B wasn't far back along the rail early, made a strong three wide run to the front midway on the turn, drew out in early stretch and held while bearing
out under left hand whip. GET THE W came in shortly after the break, was urged closer in the four path on the turn, closed a gap outside the winner in late
stretch but hung in the final yards. KAIJU ducked out into WRONG BEN leaving the gate, bumped with SNOWDAY soon after then steadied, improved
position in the five path on the turn but lacked the needed closing response. An objection by Beato against the second finisher was not allowed. SNOWDAY
(FR) came in, bumped with KAIJU after the break, steadied soon after, gained position outside, gave his best two wide between horses on the turn then
weakened. An objection by Nunez against the second finisher was not allowed. WRONG BEN was bumped leaving the gate, steadied soon after then was
outrun. BLUE Y GOLD (ARG) raced the three path and failed to menace. FORMAN THE FOREMAN was hustled to a clear lead before going a furlong,
made the way along the rail for less than a half, stopped and returned bleeding.

Footnotes
DOWNHILL RACER saved ground in midpack, surged through a large rail opening turning for home to grab the lead approaching the furlong pole, then
drew off under driving pressure. CARGO SHIP swung off the rail to the five path around the far turn, and rallied for place. MESSY BAKER chased the loose
leader from the two path, came under coaxing and took over from that foe into the far turn, held a clear advantage around that bend, but stayed off the rail
and was headed by an inner rival in upper stretch, and subsequently weakened. TEAM RIBOT came under urging to keep pace as MESSY BAKER
inherited the lead into the far turn, stayed in range in the four path through the far turn, but got outkicked in upper stretch, then brushed between horses as
his inner foe drifted outwards and oncharging outer rival came in, but was not cost a placing and kept on for minor rewards. CLOUDY SATURDAY stayed in
the four path around the first turn, swung to the seven path around the far turn and passed tired horses. WRANGLE was reluctant to load and took a few
minutes to get into the gate, then was rank and uncontrolable at the start, settled far off the pace in the two path, then stayed on mildly inside of tiring horses
through the lane. BIGASAUROUS bobbled a bit at the start, rushed through the first turn to chase the pace two to three wide around the far turn, made a bid
for the lead turning for home, but weakened in upper stretch, drifted outwards and into TEAM RIBOT at the furlong pole, then faded. OFFLEE ALEX
brushed the gate at the start, trailed the field, and never got involved. WHATA MOOSE was midpack in the three path, but weakened into the far turn. I'SE
DUBAI was fractious in the gate, built a clear margin through the first turn and opened up on the field into the backstretch, but weakened at the half mile
pole, steadily faded around the far turn, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
COLONEL MOORHEAD stalked outside the early leader in the three path, ran clear on the final turn then drew away under a hand ride. OMENED BY was
slow to settle, raced three wide around the final turn and was best of tired ones while no threat to the winner. GOTTOASKCHARLIE made a run outside
horses on the backstretch, raced three wide around the final turn and stopped in the lane. NOBLE DESCENDANT moved closer between horses on the
backstretch, raced two wide around the final turn then had nothing left for the drive. GEMS MINESHAFT RVF wasn't far back along the rail, steadied behind
the stricken horse nearing the quarter pole, angled out and stopped. JOHNNY JUNIOR was outrun inside. SLY WILDCAT made the pace in the two path
into the far turn, took a bad step near the five-sixteenths pole, was eased to the end then was vanned off.

Footnotes
HERE'S A JETPACK settled far off the pace, came off of the fence to pass a tiring rival while in tight quarters as OGEECHEE kept him in passing the five
sixteenths pole, sustained his rally in upper stretch, commenced a rail bid through a large opening inside the final furlong, and got up approaching the wire.
TWEET KITTEN stalked three wide, inched forward around the turn and bid for the lead turning for home and commenced a duel, but was herded outwards
by his inner dueling foe, then prevailed over that foe, but was bested by another inner rival approaching the wire. BEARCAT KITTEN established a clear
advantage early while staying in the two path, met a challenge from TWEET KITTEN turning for home, drifted out while hanging on his left lead in upper
stretch, and was bested by an inner rival approaching the wire. OGEECHEE broke out and bumped an outer foe into another rival at the start, settled in the
two path in midpack, came into the lane in the three path, then stayed on mildly inside of rivals without threatening the leaders. PARAUARI (FR) took a
bump from an inner rival at the start, was in range of the leader in the two path around the turn, shifted to the four path turning for home, but lacked a kick
and got outfinished for minor rewards. DOUBLE SKY stayed in the four to five path to be outside of the leaders, but lacked a rally in upper stretch. SPIRITS
LEGACY shied outwards at the start, trailed in the four to six path around the turn, and passed a tiring rival without making an impact. ALBERTOS AL
QUINTO was bumped by an inner rival at the start, raced close to the pace along the inside, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole and subsequently
stopped.
