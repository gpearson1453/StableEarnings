CASTLE RIDGE prompted the early pace two wide, secured command mid way on the turn, was under urging in the stretch and eagerly pulled away.
BARBSGRAY LION , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, angled out entering the stretch and weakened. SLEWZER showed speed along the rail,
weakened and drifted out near the eighth pole. HUG A TREE saved ground on the turn, swung out in upper stretch and retreated. MISSIN MAGGIE lacked
speed, hugged the inner rail around the turn and through the stretch and passed tired horses. GREASEDLIGHTNING , two wide on the turn, swung to the
four path turning for home and gave way. JAZZY JUDER chased the pace three deep around the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
OMNI DIVA tracked the leaders three to four wide, advanced under a drive in upper stretch, bid between foes with a furlong to go, gained a slim lead to the
inside of PRETTY AND FAST heading towards the sixteenth marker, dueled and edged away under hand encouragement the final yards. PRETTY AND
FAST , bumped at the break, raced off the pace while under urging, gathered momentum while hustled along mid turn, ranged up five wide and challenged
in mid stretch, garnered a slim lead soon after, battled outside OMNI DIVA then hung. SEVILLA SANGRIA came out a bit at the break and bumped
PRETTY AND FAST, corrected and moved to a short lead inside rivals, shook clear around the turn, raced two to three wide in upper stretch, could not
resist threats leaving the furlong grounds and faded. UNIQUELY MINE broke slowly, lagged off the pace, angled off the inside for the drive but failed to
generate a solid kick. GOLDEN CHANCE , racing without front shoes, disputed the early pace outside SEVILLE SANGRIA, failed to keep pace leaving the
three eighths pole, dropped in towards the rail and gave way.

and battled on even terms with WHOISAPRETTYGIRL past the furlong grounds, gained a slim lead a sixteenth out then dug in tenaciously under right
handed rousing to prevail. WHOISAPRETTYGIRL , away well and flashed speed, rated back off the leader and angled out, stalked three wide, bid four wide
to take over into the lane, dropped in sparring outside the winner leaving the eighth pole, ceded the lead near the sixteenth marker then continued gamely to
just miss. ONE SLICK CHICK stalked the leaders two wide, was under pressure mid turn, eased out and came back willingly to gain the show. OLIVE'S
BUMPA stalked the pace four wide, circled five wide under a ride into the lane, gave futile chase past mid stretch then faded. PRINCESS ANNE , sluggish
from the gate, lagged off the pace, raced well wide throughout and got past tired rivals. VICS COOL CAT stalked the early pace three wide, angled wider
under a ride in upper stretch and gave way. LILLY'S LIL GEM sped clear leaving the chute, set the pace off the rail, could not fend off challenges near the
quarter pole and tired.

ONEMOREGREATTIME broke sharply, rated kindly while prompting the pace three wide, moved to apply more pressure past the three eighths pole, gained
a slim lead soon into the lane, was roused clear past the three sixteenths, wandered outward from left handed stick work then dug in gamely to hold off
THREES OVER DEUCES. THREES OVER DEUCES was steadied along heading towards the turn, advanced between foes mid turn, angled five wide into
the lane, ranged up past the furlong grounds, drifted out a bit then continued gamely. TACO SUPREAM , off a bit slow when brushed, regrouped and moved
up outside rivals into the turn, was under a ride chasing four to five wide in upper stretch but failed to muster up a significant late response. OLDIES BUT
GOODIES sped to the front, set the pace in the two path, took pressure from the three eighths, ceded to the winner in upper stretch, kept on to about the
eighth pole then faded. EASTERN BAY saved ground chasing the leaders and faded. FORT FORTITUDE , three to four wide stalking the pace, was under a
ride past the three eighths, failed to kick on and retreated through the drive.

SHAK'S HIDDEN GEM stalked the pace two to three wide, bid to engage the leader past the five sixteenths, was floated out to about the four path soon into
the lane, gained a slim advantage and dueled inside the three sixteenths, shook clear with a sixteenth to go, drifted out late and held firm under a drive.
CHICKEN DINNER was taken back soon after the break and settled well off the pace, dropped in and edged up to the inside of a rival leaving the three
eighths, swung well wide into the lane, straightened away and closed steadily. LADY ROZINA rated early, advanced two wide mid turn, stayed towards the
inside in the drive and churned on willingly. OYA , three wide between rivals early, pursued three wide into the lane, dropped in some late but came up
empty. LADY LOOSE sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, met the winner's bid past the five sixteenths, drifted out entering the lane, corrected
to keep up the fight past mid stretch then gave way. COUNTRY LINEDANCER , four wide chasing the pace, faded. MAJORIE MUGS saved ground, raced
in range into the lane and faded. PERFECT PARTY GIRL was outrun.
