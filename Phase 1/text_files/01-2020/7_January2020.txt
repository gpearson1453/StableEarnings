Footnotes
BLUE STEEL bumped with a rival at the start, stalked the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, cruised to the lead in upper stretch, was asked
outside the furlong marker and drew off under a solid hand ride to prove much the best. CIVIL showed good speed and set the pace, vied along the rail
while inside of two foes on the turn, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and proved no match for the winner while able to get the place. CABO
HEADACHE steadied briefly after the start, was urged along towards the rear, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, angled out in
upper stretch and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. DISTINCT QUALITY tracked the pace on the inside of the winner, was urged
along between horses in the two path on the turn, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and tired. HITTHEGROUNDRUNNIN angled in at the rear of the
field, was ridden along at the back, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. WELLFIELD bumped with a rival at the start, settled on the outside, was
urged along while three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch under a drive and failed to respond. BLUEWATER CAT was urged along off
the pace, rounded the turn in the two path and faltered.

Footnotes
MARTIAL EAGLE broke out at the start then was hustled, dropped from the six path to the two path early on the first turn, was reserved at the back then let
out near the five-eighths, came back in hand around the half-mile before being roused at the seven-sixteenths, raced in the two path under urging early on
the far turn, paused behind horses inside the five-sixteenths then angled four wide, came six wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside and closed well to
win going away. MIDNIGHT PATRIOT was well placed just behind the leader on the inside, moved out inside the half-mile pole, ranged up four wide on the
turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, dropped to the three path into the stretch then drifted in while moving
clear, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while just able to get the place. ARABIAN STORY set the pace in the two path, was asked
early on the far turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole, dropped back under the whip into upper stretch, angled out behind the runner-up at the
three-sixteenths and kept on in the final furlong but was outfinished then just missed the place. CANDIZAR went around the first turn in the three path,
stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, dropped back passing the three-sixteenths and
tired. ZENMAN was reluctant to load, came out some after the start, went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, dropped well behind while five
wide on the far turn and faltered.

BET AGAIN bumped with a rival at the start, was well placed in third position, started the turn in the two path then shifted three wide, moved to four wide
around the five-sixteenths, advanced to make a bid at the quarter-pole then took the lead shortly thereafter, kicked clear at the three-sixteenths and proved
best under steady urging. PHAT AND FAST broke a half-step slow, was urged along while last but one, went around the turn in the two path, came out
under a left-handed whip in upper stretch, drifted out while chasing the winner under a drive and finished willingly in the middle of the track to garner the
place. MR. PRIORITY leaned out at the start and broke a step slow, was ridden along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, moved out under a drive
just after turning into the stretch, chased the winner into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked then lost the place while well clear for the show. CABO'S
RUMOR broke a half-step slow, was urged along at the rear, drifted out midway down the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path and was no factor.
FAREWELL TIME tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the turn, took the lead at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage just
inside the quarter-pole then drifted in and tired. SOUTHERN SWAGG broke in and bumped with a rival, set the clear pace, vied in the two path early on the
turn, lost the lead near the five-sixteenths, dropped to the rail late on the bend and capitulated. D'TUFF CAT REY was urged along off the pace, chased in
the five path on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch under the whip and stopped.

Footnotes
SHO POKE went to the front, set the pace in the two path, moved clear on the far turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, responded well when put to a drive
in upper stretch and held under strong urging. TAKE CHARGE D'ORO was last to commence, went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the back,
was roused while five wide on the far turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the whip, rallied outside into upper stretch, chased the winner into the final
furlong, gained gradually on that foe late and just missed while clear for the place. GO FOR MOONSHINE had a shoe repaired in the paddock, went three
wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the far turn and weakened while able to get the show. SPIRITUAL WARFARE
went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the back, was roused leaving the backstretch, went three wide under urging on the far turn, swung
six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. UPTOWN RULER bumped with a rival at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked
leaving the backstretch, went four wide under urging on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and lacked the needed response. YEEHAW was
taken back while off heels briefly early on the first turn, established a good position just off the pace, was ridden along in the two path on the far turn and
retreated.

drive into the final sixteenth then was placed under a hand ride late while much the best. THE MO U NO was well placed just off the pace on the inside,
chased under strong urging on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and safely secured the place while no match for the winner.
WHATDATPAY RAY dropped his head just as the gate opened and broke a bit slow then was taken up, rounded the first turn in the two path, lagged well
behind the rest of the field, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved out some around the
three-sixteenths and got up for the show. BIG BOY DAVE REX went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was coaxed along midway
down the backstretch, chased in the three path on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and tired. POWER JET saved ground on the first turn, settled
towards the back, was hard ridden while two to three wide on the far turn and failed to respond. RICHIE GARY went four wide on the first turn, settled on the

Footnotes
PALACE COUP set the pace in the two to three path, responded well under pressure on the far turn, shook clear in upper stretch and drew away under
strong urging. FREE SPENDER bumped soundly with a foe at the start, bumped with another rival early, went three to four wide on the first turn, tracked the
pace on the outside, made a bid under urging in the three to four path on the far turn, lost touch with the winner under a drive in upper stretch and proved no
match while well clear for the place. MISCHIEVOUS MO bumped with a foe early, saved ground under a tight hold on the first turn, was rated just off the
pace, drafted in the two path on the far turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, moved out while chasing in upper stretch then dropped back in some
and tired but held the show. CASK went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the back, was ridden along in the two path on the far turn and
came up empty. NOBLE ORDER bumped soundly with a rival at the start then checked, went three wide on the first turn, settled at the back on the outside,
was ridden along while three wide on the far turn and failed to respond. THREE-QUARTER FRACTION WAS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER

Footnotes
GRAND OMEGA was urged along off the pace, angled in midway down the backstretch, raced in the two path on the turn, moved out while gaining in upper
stretch, accelerated to the lead inside the three-sixteenths, drifted in under a right-handed whip while moving clear outside the sixteenth-pole then was
switched to a left-handed whip and proved best under strong handling. HALFOURRETIREMENT disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the
rail on the turn, came under the whip in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and was outfinished but showed good courage to hold the place.
KING BAYOU chased the leading duo on the outside, went four wide on the turn, gained into upper stretch, loomed a threat into the final furlong but was
out-kicked while just able to get the show. CLEVER RACER raced on the far outside while urged along, was caught seven wide early on the turn then
dropped to five wide, moved to four wide near the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under a drive, angled out around the three-sixteenths and finished
with late energy to just miss the show. GRAND TY bumped with MAY HOUR at the start, bumped again with that foe early then had him clip his heels, was
ridden along off the pace, went six wide early on the turn then dropped to four wide, moved to three wide late on that bend and failed to threaten. SAINT
WILLIAM contested the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, came under the whip in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and
tired. MAY HOUR bumped with GRAND TY at the start, bumped the hindquarters of that foe early, clipped heels and fell at that point then returned to his
feet before being caught by the outrider and walked off. Following a stewards' inquiry into the incident early in the race, no change was made to the order of
finish.
