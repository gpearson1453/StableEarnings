Footnotes
CACTUS COPY opened a short lead from between rivals early on the backstretch, angled in entering the turn to be two wide, drew out entering the stretch
then held under steady urging. FARFALLA, bumped lightly after the break, was taken in hand early on the backstretch after joining rivals on the front end,
steadied back when the winner angled in nearing the end of the backstretch, was caught in tight two wide between rivals for most of the turn, angled to the
rail for room entering the stretch then slowly closed a gap in deep stretch. SNEAKY COWGIRL wasn't far back outside early, made a strong four wide run
on the turn to loom boldly into the stretch but flattened out. BOWTIE DIVA, bumped lightly leaving the gate, lagged inside early, swung to the outside leaving
the turn and made up ground too late. SAVANNAH ROXANNA was prominent outside the first flight on the backstretch, remained within easy striking
distance three wide to the stretch, tired and was eased up late. GRACIAS ADIOS came in, bumped BOWTIE DIVA lightly leaving the gate, came out soon
after, bumped lightly with the winner, showed speed along the rail to the stretch then tired.

Footnotes
AXE CAPITAL set a pressured pace while staying in the two path, shook free from her outer pressing foe in upper stretch, built a clear advantage
approaching the furlong pole, then tired in the late stages, but lasted. FIORE stalked from the along the rail, came under coaxing passing the seven
sixteenths pole, then saved ground around the turn before tipping to the three path approaching the sixteenth pole, sustained her grinding rally, but it was
not enough, and prevailed for place between horses. LITTLE UNITED raced inside of a foe from midpack, shifted off the rail around the turn and split foes in
the three path at the quarter pole, then tipped to the four path turning for home to make a late rally outside of rivals, but was fended off for place. VIBRANT
GINGER pulled under a tight hold to pressure the pace setter while being kept in the three path by that rival, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper
stretch, and got outfinished for minor rewards. STROLL ACTION might slight progress in the four to five path around the turn from midpack, but flattened out
turning for home. ATHENA IN FLIGHT stalked in the four path outside of foes, shifted to the two path around the bend and tracked in range of the leaders
turning for home, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. JAZZLYN was far off the pace in the three to four path around the turn, but was never a
factor. OUR HONEY BELLE was brushed between horses by an inner foe at the start, then trailed throughout while saving ground and never got involved.

Footnotes
COLOR FORCE was content to lag inside following a slow break, angled out wide on the final turn while moving, circled into the stretch, reached the front in
late stretch and drew clear through the final yards. JEWELS AND PEARLS pressed in the three path outside the early leader, moved to a short lead in
midstretch then gave way late. BOX OF GOLD ducked in leaving the gate, settled inside, came out between rivals for the drive and finished willingly. WELL
TRIED took command at once, stayed out from the rail while making the way into midstretch then weakened. STEADY ROCK fell back between rivals on
the backstretch, raced two wide around the final turn, swung out entering the stretch, steadied in tight soon after then continued evenly. IRISH GLITTER
was slow early then passed tired ones in the lane. TIZ PROMISING RVF was urged closer two wide between rivals on the final turn, drifted slightly in early
stretch then was eased up through the final sixteenth. TWO WAY ROAD advanced the rail on the backstretch then faded steadily. DEVIL'S FLAIR was
caught wide around the first turn while unhurried, made a four wide run around the final turn, had nothing left for the drive and was eased up. ALPHARDINI
ducked out leaving the gate, was caught four wide around the first turn while not far back, raced wide into the far turn, stopped soon after and was eased up
through the lane.

Footnotes
CLINIC vied for the lead along teh inside into the the first turn, but allowed HERE COMES GARY to draw clear into the backstretch, stalked the loose leader
inside of MAJESTIC CALLING, got outmoved as that foe made first run into the far turn, saved ground before tipping to the four path to be outside of the
leaders in upper stretch, and offered a strong late rally to get up at the wire. MAJESTIC CALLING stalked the loose leader from the two to three path, inched
forward and chased that foe around the far turn while narrowing the margin, bid the for the lead passing the quarter pole, forged an advantage approaching
the furlong pole, but was confronted by CLINIC to his outside while putting away the early leader, then dug in through the late stages, but was nipped at the
wire. HERE COMES GARY drew clear of the field and maneuvered down the to two path around the first turn, drew off and held a long lead into the far turn,
but was confronted by MAJESTIC CALLING at the quarter pole, got headed by that foe in upper stretch, then gave way at the furlong pole and just held
show. DEFINITELY TONIGHT saved ground from midpack, then made a mild rally along the rail passed tired horses through the lane, and missed the photo
for show. TINTO MESA hesitated at the start and raced far off the pace, advanced slightly in the four path down the backstretch, but failed to make an
impact. BLUEGRASS POSSE tracked from midpack in the two to four path, but never factored. RIDE THIS TRAIN was outrun and never got involved.

NEXT QUEEN advanced between rivals on the backstretch, edged out three wide nearing the stretch for room, vied outside the early leaders into the final
eighth and drove clear after five furlongs. RAIN RUNNER bobbled while breaking sharply, pressed the pace two wide around the turn, angled to the rail in
midstretch while dueling inside the winner then weakened. TIZ TAS TIME opened a short lead soon after the break, stayed close to the rail around the turn
then tired in the drive. LOVELY O'PRADO went in the air at the break, lagged early, made a run three wide between rivals around the turn, weakened and
outlasted tired ones. SEMAYA was steadied when bumped between rivals soon after the break, stayed out from the rail around the turn and stopped in the
lane. SUNNY HILL BOBBIE made a run outside the winner on the backstretch, raced wide around the turn then stopped. BUTTON CANDY stayed inside,
stopped and was eased up late. JOYOFTHIRTYSEVEN bobbled leaving the gate, swung wide into the stretch and failed to matter. POOCHIE LOU stayed
inside and was finished early. SHE'S SURE CLASSY was hustled from the gate, never entered the chase and was eased up late.

OLDFASHIONED CLUB dueled from the three to the two path around the first turn, drew clear of his inner dueling counterpart into the far turn, and widened
his advantage at will through then lane under mild hand urging. MIDNIGHT DANCE dueled inside of OLDFASHIONED CLUB down the backstretch, but was
no match for that rival into the far turn, and was a clear second best. HOLY SNIP advanced between horses from the three to four path around the far turn,
reached show at the furlong pole, but never threatened. STONE CRAZY saved ground from midpack, made a show bid inside of foes approaching the
furlong pole, but weakened. SHIPTHEGRIP stalked along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the leaders down the backstretch, then drifted to the three
path turning for home and weakened. HOLIDAY TOUCH took the turns in the four path then the five path, and never played a factor. INOROUT saved
ground, but was never involved. HASTA AHORA was outrun while in the three path around the first turn, then in the five path around the second, and was
eased through the lane.

Footnotes
QUEEN COURAGE was rated early, quickly ran clear in the three path just after six furlongs, drifted badly in early stretch and continued to drift to the end.
SYDNEY TIME raced well out into the track while trailing into the stretch then made a belated run outside. MYDRINKSELECTION ran clear before going a
furlong, was rank under rating while trying to get out around the first turn, settled into the two path then tired in the lane. GFOUR was slow early, stayed
inside and found best stride too late. NEW FOUND TREASURE wasn't far back in the two path early, appeared to bobble near the seventy yard pole and
was eased up. SPRING AWAY broke slowly, steadied along the rail nearing the first turn, moved closer on the backstretch, stopped in the lane and was
eased up. BEATUBYACHUBINOSE raced the three path, stopped after six furlongs and was eased up.

Footnotes
JUST DO THE MATH set the pace from the onset while staying in the three path, met inside challenges from a pair of rivals passing the half mile pole,
dueled with them into the turn, but forged clear again from them at the quarter pole, drifted inwards in upper stretch, and held TWO RED CENTS' late bid at
bay. TWO RED CENTS stalked along the inside, maneuvered off the rail at the five sixteenths pole, tipped to the three path to be loaded between horses
and behind the leader at the quarter pole, but was hesitant to split rivals turning for home, causing him to get outkicked by the leader, then gained stride
passing the furlong pole, surged late, but it was not enough. MALICIOUS INTENT stalked two wide, made a four wide bid for the lead approaching the
quarter pole, but was outkicked by the leader in upper stretch, then hung on his left lead and failed to make late headway. INALIENABLE RIGHTS took the
turn in the four to six path while midpack, ducked outwards in upper stretch, but quickened when corrected and offered a late rally passed tired horses.
NORMANDY BEACH moved up to duel inside a pair of rivals into the turn, but failed to keep pace with the eventual winner turning for home, then gave way
for minor rewards at the furlong pole. KUCHEROV dueled two wide and between horses into the turn, but failed to keep pace with his outer rival at the
quarter pole, and weakened at the furlong pole. SUGAR TRAIN trailed in the five path around the turn, then passed a pair of tiring foes in upper stretch
without factoring. TALE OF THE BLADE was outrun while in the four path. SARATOGA SHINER was outrun while in the three path.
