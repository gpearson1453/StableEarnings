CHIEF CICATRIZ set a pressured early pace, went four wide into the turn, drifted out through the turn, kept on gamely and held for the win. RUNAWAY
GHOST was allowed to settle early, raced between rivals into the turn, angled out in early stretch, shifted back in through mid stretch, was gaining on the
winner and finished second best. RAAGHEB was unhurried early, loomed six wide into the turn and finished evenly in late stretch. ARTICULATOR tracked
the early pace, went five wide into the turn, lost his path, angled out and offered a mild late rally. MAJOR MUNNINGS forced the early pace, raced along the
inside and weakened in late stretch. TIZ ALLUPTOME NOW trailed throughout.

Footnotes
INCLUDE HOO settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the second turn, offered a bid in tandem with TROPPER into the stretch, vied with that
rival through a vigorous drive and gamely prevailed. TROOPER was allowed to settle early, advanced five-wide through the second turn, reached the
leaders with three-sixteenths to run, vied with the winner and just missed in a good effort. SEBASTIAN CAPE raced four-wide through the first turn, showed
no early speed, saved ground through the second turn, remained inside for the drive and finished evenly late. ANALYZING dueled for the lead from off the
rail with MUSCLE HEAD and gave way after going three-quarters. THE KID IN SYD was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn,
offered a bid into the stretch and failed to sustain his rally in the drive. MUSCLE HEAD was away in good order to dispute the pace with ANALYZING while
racing three-wide and weakened after going six furlongs.
