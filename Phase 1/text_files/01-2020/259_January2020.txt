Footnotes
PENANCE was reluctant loading, chased close up outside, moved up on the turn, rallied widest into the stretch, closed steadily outside and was up late for
the win. MADAME TIGER vied two wide for the lead, dueled on the turn, shook free in upper stretch and dug in gamely to the end. LIVIN A DREAM chased
the leaders, raced inside on the turn, angled out at the quarter pole and rallied mildly. VIVA NEVADA raced off the rail, off the pace, closed belatedly inside
in the stretch drive. LOOKINGFORANEWSPOT was off a bit slow, moved up inside to set the pace, dueled inside on the turn and tired. SOUTHERN
TOUCH raced off the pace and did not factor. BRAZILIAN SYMPHONY was outrun.

Footnotes
ALAAPATIQUE alternated for the lead inside, edged away entering the stretch, drifted out a bid through early stretch, was straightened away and edged
clear. HIS ROYAL MAJESTY broke slowly, saved ground to stretch, eased out through stretch but had no late gain. CHAMPAGNE CHUCK dueled for the
lead two wide then tired. LOST IRON saved ground, eased off the rail on the backstretch, bid then tired. CAR FIFTY FOUR was wide throughout and failed
to be a serious threat. SALUTATION eased out on the backstretch, joined for command three wide before a half, remained a factor to the final turn then
tired. DE PUNTA A PUNTA, in the four path, showed little.

pace inside and had no rally. CANIFORM raced off the pace inside and did not factor. WILD ABOUT DEB raced off the rail, off the pace and was outrun.

Footnotes
AMERICAN ROMA bobbled breaking slowly but recovered quickly and was sent up to join the leaders four wide, took the lead on the far turn, opened a long
lead in mid stretch and won under wraps. BELLY DANCER, in the five path and outrun, drifted wider on the backstretch, raced very wide into stretch, drifted
wider and was second best. BACKSTRETCH GEORGE, outrun to stretch, raced five wide into stretch and passed faders. BANKER'S ISLAND raced two
wide vying for command, drifted out leaving the final turn and gave way. MIND MAGIC saved ground and was not a factor. NOBLE KENT broke slowly,
raced just off the rail, eased out near stretch, took up when impeded in mid stretch. J R JELLYBEAN saved ground setting the early pace, bore out and
impeded NOBLE KENT, in the stretch, RYDELL raced wide and failed to menace. THE MONEY TRAIN between foes dueling, steadied retreating on the
final turn. GOURMET DELIGHT saved ground early, drifted out and tired. CINCO Y CINCO showed little. AS PER RULING 20039 FROM THE PA. STATE
RACING COMMISSION, AMERICAN ROMA WAS DQ'D AND PLACED LAST.
