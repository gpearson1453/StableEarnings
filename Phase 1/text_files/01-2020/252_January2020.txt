Footnotes
SILVER KITTEN was ridden along out of the gate, assumed command and crossed over to the inside entering the first turn, dictated the pace racing along
the inside down the backstretch, held firm around the far turn then widened advantage upper stretch, responded under steady pressure and kept clear.
SISTER HANAN was allowed to settle out of the gate, continued unhurried down the backstretch, raced two wide between foes entering the far turn, angled
out wider and set down for the drive, rallied through the lane but got in gear too late to overtaken the winner. UNA LUNA settled while rated near midpack,
hustled up entering the far turn and raced three wide at the quarter pole, stayed on with response into the lane then lacked a closing kick for serious impact.
DEVIOUS CHARM was forwardly placed and raced just off the early leader, launched a two wide bid for command around the far turn then finished evenly
through the lane. PAKHET settled in early stages, hustled along two wide around the far turn, continued a steady even bid through the lane and needed
more for late impact. EQUAL MEASURE raced near mid-range while rated along the inside down the backstretch, sat patiently awaiting an opening along
the rail through the far turn, angled out at head of the lane and put to pressure but failed to kick on. DESIGNING stalked the pacesetter down the
backstretch, roused along the rail around the far turn then gave way in the lane. RESTRUCTURE raced in range along the outside through early stages,
launched a four wide bid around the far turn then failed to keep pace and faded in the stretch. CHILLED MILK raced off the pace, urged for response
entering the far turn but failed to move on. ARMY OF ONE settled along inside down the backstretch, got in tight and steadied near the three eighths pole
then faded.

Footnotes
CANDY TYCOON grabbed the early lead, rated along being pressured from the outside by GIMME SOME MO, turned back a challenge from that rival after
six furlongs and widened through the stretch driving inside. GIMME SOME MO shadowed the winner from the outset, dialed up the pressure around the far
turn, got shaken off while lugging in past the eighth-pole and was clearly second best. ELUSIVE RULER was outrun for six furlongs, began moving four
wide late on the far turn, shifted to the two-path after straightening away and was up for the show. TONS OF GOLD was reserved in traffic three wide
around the first turn, stayed in the three-path through the far turn and lacked a solid response. HOLY EMPEROR raced well back early, put in a mild run four
wide on the far turn but flattened out. EXTREME FORCE stayed in range early, and faded five wide coming off the second turn. EMBRACE MY UNCLE had
early striking range inside, but gave way after six furlongs. TROVE broke slowly, and showed little. LIBERTY BLUE was strung out five wide around the first
turn, advanced into the far turn while moving in some, and gave way approaching the stretch. JACK'S ADVANTAGE was forwardly placed four wide early,
and moved inward while tiring steadily around the far turn.

Footnotes
TEXAS WEDGE was off to a good start then settled and edged back into tracking position, was patiently piloted along the inside around the turn then angled
out turning for home, was put to a drive and ranged up to race in aim for the lead, exchanged head bobs with CAROTARI deep stretch then edged by.
CAROTARI raced up close out of the gate and applied pressure to the leader around the turn, given cue for command top stretch, roused forward and
seized command from PAY ANY PRICE, quickly came under attack and dug in gamely, vied deep stretch with TEXAS WEDGE and just missed. FIELDER
bumped with rival then steadied a stride out and raced near the back, took closer order then hustled along two wide into upper stretch, altered course to
race five wide and edged closer. SHEKKY SHEBAZ raced up close along the inside in opening stages then steadied in the turn, waited patiently for a clear
path at the quarter pole then responded under urging and moved up to race in aim at the furlong marker, could not advance to gain equal terms with the top
pair but stayed close then steadied when CAROTARI came in a path late. ELUSIVE MISCHIEF bumped with rival at the start the lacked early kick and
raced in the back, hustled along two wide into upper stretch then switched out wider under pressure and lacked the needed response for late impact. PAY
ANY PRICE took a couple strides out of the gate to get to the lead, led the way under pressure, continued to battle back at head of the lane then got
collared at the furlong marker and gave way. VISION PERFECT chased in a forward position in early stages, evened out around the turn then offered no
late rally. FIXED POINT bumped the gate on the way out, raced in range along the outside through opening stages, continued a four wide bid around the
turn then weakened.

Footnotes
MARKET ANALYSIS tracked outside the early leaders, took over three wide approaching the stretch, drew clear through the furlong grounds and kept
ATTACHMENT RATE at a safe distance late. ATTACHMENT RATE bumped lightly with GHOST GAME at the start, lagged well back for a half-mile, came
four wide off the turn and closed strongly outside. PRECISE DANCER raced off the leading trio four wide into the turn, rallied into second outside the
sixteenth-pole but was outkicked from there. MAKE A CLASSIC was outrun early, came four wide off the turn and offered a mild late response to pick up a
share. EXPRESS PHAROAH hustled up inside out of the chute, set a pressured pace before yielding to the winner past the quarter-pole, and faded through
the drive. UNCONQUERED LEA shifted out four wide around the turn, and could not keep pace with the leaders after a half-mile. GHOST GAME bumped
lightly with ATTACHMENT RATE at the start, was outrun to the stretch and made no late headway on the far outside. SEA TRIDENT pressed the early pace
between horses, and was finished after a half. TAPI FROST was steered inside up the backstretch, came under a ride midway on the turn but tired before
reaching the stretch. YOUCANTCATCHCURLIN broke slowly and became rank through the first sixteenth of a mile, and never made contact with the others.

Footnotes
JEAN ELIZABETH was away in good order and remained forwardly positioned behind GIRLS KNOW BEST, tracked the leader around the turn, came under
right handed urging upper stretch, advanced to race in striking distance at the furlong marker then forged ahead under strong handling. GIRLS KNOW
BEST sped to the lead and held firm along the inside around the turn, dug in near the furlong marker under left handed pressure then failed to hold off the
winner in the final sixteenth. KEOTA hustled along the inside and raced off the top two leaders around the turn, shifted out three wide upper stretch,
remained in pursuit and secured share. CHARMAINE'S MIA angled to the inside in opening stages then steadied and lost momentum at the three eighths
pole, cut the corner and urged along the inside in stretch run but lacked the needed response for late impact. FACTOROFWON hustled along in steady
pursuit, urged two wide around the turn, kept under a ride in stretch run and finished evenly. MISS DEPLORABLE prompted and advanced to race off the
top pair around the turn, chased five wide into upper stretch then gave way. AMBASSADOR LUNA dropped to the inside late backstretch then was a bit
awkward in stride near the three eighths pole, angled out and raced five wide in upper stretch and had no late kick. MOONLIGHT ROMANCE raced off the
pace, moved into stretch two wide and lacked a needed rally. THINKIN COWTOWN clipped heels near the three eighths pole, lost momentum and had no
late response.

Footnotes
ATOMIC BLONDE found a cozy spot behind the early leaders inside, went along covered up in easy striking range, came through along the rail to grab the
lead from HIDDEN FACTS in upper stretch and kicked away under good handling. MITCHELL ROAD brushed the right side of the gate and was slow to
begin, began moving three then four wide after a half-mile, and rallied steadily outside rivals to pick up the place late. LA FEVE (FR) saved ground in the
middle of the field to the far turn, moved off the rail approaching the stretch and finished with good courage between horses. GETMOTHERAROSE raced
four wide most of the way, loomed a threat while shifting in through the furlong grounds but was outkicked for larger shares inside rivals. DEVANT (FR) was
outrun toward the inside to the stretch, and improved without threatening. HIDDEN FACTS set the pace slightly off the inside to the top of the stretch, and
was overrun through the last eighth of a mile. ROMANTIC MOMENT lagged well back three then four wide to the lane, and passed tired horses.
CONQUEST HARDCANDY turned her head to the left at the break and lunged out awkwardly, trailed to the stretch and passed tired foes on the far outside.
DIAMOND PLAY was never prominent. SPY RING (IRE) stayed in range two to three wide to the lane, and tired. PICARA prompted the pace outside to the
stretch, and gave way. LIMARI tracked the leaders three wide, and came up empty turning for home.

Footnotes
PHAT MAN was allowed to settle in opening stages then steadily edged up closer moving through the backstretch, moved into range entering the far turn
then prompted at the quarter pole, loomed up to strike near the furlong marker, was set down driving five wide, seized command from ZENDEN near the
final sixteenth and edged away. ZENDEN vied for the lead out of the chute, held a slim lead and set a swift-pressured pace, raced under pressure from both
sides late backstretch then dueled for the lead with STORM ADVISORY around the far turn, shook clear to a slim lead, appeared all out but continued to put
in a game effort then could not hold off the bid from the PHAT MAN in late stages. RARE FORM raced in the second flight going by five eighths pole, picked
up the pace midway around the far turn then prompted three wide entering the lane, advanced to race in close contention at the furlong marker then evened
out and held show. CHEWING GUM raced wide and unhurried in early stages then moved in to race three to four wide late backstretch, picked up the pace
around the far turn then shifted out wider upper stretch and gained on show. GRAY MAGICIAN moved in from the outside and remained off the early pace,
lodged a bid around the far turn, raced seven wide under pressure upper stretch and had a mild improve. STORM ADVISORY applied pace pressure to
ZENDEN down the backstretch, dueled for the lead with rival around the far turn then came up tired in the lane. GRAN OMERO (VEN) was reserved and
raced widest through early stages, hustled up along the outside entering the lane and passed tiring foes. EYE OF A JEDI angled in and saved ground
through the backstretch, lodged a bid along the inside entering the turn and needed more for late impact. FREE ENTERPRISE was ridden along to maintain
tempo while positioned near mid-range, urged around the far turn, fanned wider into upper stretch then gave way. OLYMPIC VILLAGE raced off the pace,
prompted around the turn then urged two wide entering top stretch and lacked a needed rally. TALE OF SILENCE raced off the pace and three wide leaving
the backstretch, moved into upper stretch five wide and failed to move on. EPIC DREAMER applied pace pressure to ZENDEN in opening stages,
continued to force the issue down the backstretch then gave way around the final turn. SEVEN TRUMPETS was ridden along near midpack then failed to
sustain bid after six furlongs. DAK ATTACK showed response in the opening quarter then faltered and was allowed to gallop home under no pressure.

Footnotes
MEAN MARY took command after the start, rated along through leisurely fractions for a mile, put daylight on LADY PANAME still unasked turning for home,
and sprinted home powerfully through the lane vigorously hand urged and struck once right-handed a sixteenth out. LADY PANAME (FR) was never far
back while taking the turns three wide, was put to a drive past the quarter-pole but made no impression on the leader, and ran on well enough to stay clear
of the rest. TOURIGA (BRZ) raced well back reserved for a mile near the two-path, and offered only a mild response through the drive. RAINING LEMONS
saved ground edging a bit closer after a mile, rallied in the two-path between horses turning for home but could not sustain the bid. WAR CABINET was
rated along in the two-path at the back for 10 furlongs, and passed only tired horses. LA AUSTRALIANA pursued the pacesetter inside for a mile or so, and
gave way. SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL (IRE) stayed in range inside for a mile, went two then three wide on the final turn, and came up empty. KELSEY'S CROSS
settled in the middle of the field two to three wide for the opening mile, moved further out and tired into the stretch. GET EXPLICIT was strung out four wide
throughout, advanced around the final turn, but faded steadily through the stretch. LATEST VERSION prompted the pace outside the winner for a mile and
tired.

Footnotes
PINK SANDS was allowed to settle out of the gate then shifted in a few paths, remained settled off the early pace, tapped on the shoulder leaving the
backstretch, prompted around the turn then raced wide entering the lane, kicked in gamely, rallied along the far outside and finished going away.
WILDWOOD'S BEAUTY raced in range and patiently handled behind foes two to three wide near the half mile marker, lacked a clear path then edged back
a bit past the three eighths pole and angled out wider, loomed up leaving the turn, raced wide and advanced to race in striking range at the furlong marker
then failed to be a match when then the winner kicked by. NONNA MADELINE was off a step slow then quickly advanced into closer contention and
steadied between foes mid-backstretch, remained forwardly placed around the turn, given cue two wide top stretch, raced in close contention then evened
out late. SPICED PERFECTION was ridden along to maintain tempo while positioned near mid-range, prompted and loomed up to challenge for the lead
near the quarter pole, held the slight edge at the furlong marker then weakened late. OUR SUPER FREAK raced outside off the early pace, prompted five
wide around the turn, moved out wider for the drive and needed more for late impact. A BIT OF BOTH was forwardly placed through early stages then
lodged a bid entering the turn, vied for the lead at the quarter pole, stayed in aim with a furlong left to run then weakened. BACCARAT FASHION was a step
slow then angled in to the rail position, raced in tight quarters at the half mile marker then steadied repeatedly around the turn, put to a drive at head of the
lane, showed brief response then flattened out. BRONX BEAUTY was reserved and raced widest through the backstretch, continued widest under pressure
into stretch and lacked a needed rally. HEAVENHASMYNIKKI showed brief response in early stages then retreated. LIZA STAR dueled inside verse a duo
down the backstretch, battled into the turn then retreated. J P'S DELIGHT dueled between rivals down the backstretch then quickly retreated around the
turn. BLAMED dueled for the lead down the backstretch and into the turn then came up empty turning for home.

Footnotes
SPOOKY CHANNEL bumped lightly with AMERICAN TATTOO at the start, found a comfortable position in the middle of the pack for a mile, advanced
steadily four wide around the final turn, and rallied determinedly to wear down CROSS BORDER from outside in the closing strides. CROSS BORDER
prompted the pace outside DUBBY DUBBIE from the opening bell, dueled with that one around the third turn, gained command through upper stretch and
kicked clear, but could not withstand the top one. APRECIADO saved ground unhurried for the first mile, moved out to the two-path nearing the top of the
stretch, rallied between horses past the eighth-pole and finished up evenly. RED KNIGHT trailed inside for a mile, came under a ride attempting a five-wide
sweep around the final turn, and had no punch through the last eighth of a mile. CAROM saved ground early in mid pack, swung four wide approaching the
stretch and did not have nearly enough. PUMPKIN RUMBLE was forwardly placed between horses from the outset, moved out to the three-path at the top
of the lane and lacked a solid response. PRINCE OF ARABIA raced two wide for a mile before moving one path farther out, and made no impact. DUBBY
DUBBIE set the pace inside for a mile, got outdueled around the final turn by CROSS BORDER, and gave way on the rail through the drive. SHAZIER
steadied between PUMPKIN RUMBLE and SPOOKY CHANNEL just after the start, and was outrun throughout. SALUTE THE COLONEL became rank
under restraint behind the leaders on the first turn, settled down somewhat through the stretch the first time, stayed covered up in easy striking range to the
top of the stretch, and came up empty when roused. AMERICAN TATTOO (ARG) bumped lightly with the eventual winner at the start, pursued the leaders
three wide for a mile, and dropped back through the third turn.

Footnotes
ZULU ALPHA was allowed to settle out of the gate then steadied along inside nearing the first turn, secured inside position and settled nicely off the early
pace, was patiently handled entering the far turn then hustled up near the quarter pole, cut the corner entering the lane, came under right handed pressure
along the rail upper stretch, kicked in gamely up the inside, seized command from MAGIC WAND near the furlong marker and drew clear. MAGIC WAND
(IRE) cleared on top out of the gate and crossed over to the inside, secured inside position and set a pressured pace down the backstretch, vied for the lead
racing inside of HANLEY'S JOY around the final turn, dug in gamely and held a slim lead upper stretch, got collared by the winner near the furlong marker
but stayed on game to hold place. INSTILLED REGARD was forwardly placed out of the gate then settled and raced in range through middle stages,
positioned as a sharp factor while patiently handled along the inside around the far turn, tipped out turning for home, put to a drive three to our wide and
stayed on with response to clear share. SACRED LIFE (FR) raced near midpack between foes going by the half mile marker, lodged a bid moving through
the far turn then swung out wider into upper stretch, remained in pursuit under steady pressure along the outside and improved position. ARKLOW got
bumped a step out of the gate then steadied racing two wide nearing the first turn, settled off the early pace then launched an outside bid entering the far
turn, coaxed five to six wide in stretch run and needed more for late impact. SADLER'S JOY got bumped back between foes and lost ground at the start,
continued unhurried down the backstretch, picked up the pace along the outside around the far turn, raced extremely wide and lost ground entering upper
stretch then gained a few spots. HENLEY'S JOY was forwardly placed and stalked the pacesetter down the backstretch, prompted and advanced to duel for
the lead with MAGIC WAND around the far turn, remained up close upper stretch then gave way in the final furlong. ADMISSION OFFICE raced three wide
entering the first turn then settled off the early pace, moved through the far turn two wide, hit some traffic top stretch then switched out wider and failed to
kick on. MO FORZA fanned out six wide entering the first turn, rated along the outside near midpack down the backstretch, was ridden along four wide
positioned in range around the far turn then failed to sustain bid in the lane. CHANNEL CAT got bumped steps out of the gate, was unhurried racing two to
three wide down the backstretch, saved ground and urged for response along the rail in the far turn but failed to threaten. WITHOUT PAROLE (GB) got
bumped a step out of the gate, moved up to race in range mid-pack at the half mile marker then launched a bid entering the far turn, failed to gain closer
contention then gave way. NEXT SHARES raced five wide entering the first turn, tracked the pace to the far turn, remained in close contention entering the
turn then put to a drive but had no response when called upon.

Footnotes
MUCHO GUSTO broke to the lead and moved inward, deferred around the first turn content to follow along from close range, was guided out three wide
midway on the far turn, responded readily to overtake MR FREEZE and BODEXPRESS from outside at the top of the stretch, and drew well clear under a
drive. MR FREEZE was crowded a bit by MUCHO GUSTO at the break, went into the first turn in the six-path before moving inward and coming away with
the lead before completing the first quarter-mile, moved inside cutting an even pace through the middle stages, fended off a challenge from BODEXPRESS
around the far turn, could not cope with the winner into the lane and dug in to save the place. WAR STORY was slow into stride and taken over to the rail
after the start, trailed for six furlongs saving ground, angled to the far outside leaving the far turn and rallied steadily to get up for third. DIAMOND OOPS
saved ground early under a firm hold, moved off the rail entering the backstretch, advanced mildly in the two-path after six furlongs, moved further out in the
stretch and finished evenly. BODEXPRESS became keyed up vying up front into the first turn between horses, tugged along pressing MR FREEZE up the
backstretch, challenged sternly after six furlongs, but weakened at the top of the stretch and faded late. TENFOLD was six wide going to the first turn before
moving inward, advanced mildly after six furlongs two then three wide on the far turn, and flattened out. SEEKING THE SOUL got jostled around between
horses four then three wide into the first turn, and never became a factor. TRUE TIMBER exchanged light bumps and brushes with TAX into the first turn,
lagged in the second flight two wide, moved inside and dropped back after six furlongs. TAX stumbled at the start, bumped and brushed lightly with TRUE
TIMBER into the first turn, settled in the middle of the field three wide for six furlongs, and faded steadily in the five-path into the stretch. HIGHER POWER
was forwardly placed four then three wide on the first turn, came under a ride past the half-mile pole attempting to keep pace with the leaders, but had little
to offer and began dropping back steadily between horses outside the quarter-pole.
