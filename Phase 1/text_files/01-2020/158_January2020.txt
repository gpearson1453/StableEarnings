Footnotes
FORTY NINE MODEL was away alertly, pressed the pace on the inside, took the advantage while inside to the two path early on the turn, shook clear
outside the five-sixteenths, responded well when set down in upper stretch and drew off under strong urging. ZYDECO MUSIC broke a half-step slow,
settled towards the rear, was urged along while inside on the turn, cut the corner into the stretch and secured the place while no match for winner.
LANGFUHR'S ANGEL broke a half-step slow, settled near the back, went around the turn in the two path, was put to a drive turning into the stretch, moved
out near the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. CHANSON LA BELLE broke out at the start, was urged along on
the outside, went four wide for most of the turn, shifted six wide around a stopping rival inside the five-sixteenths, dropped to five into the stretch and failed
to threaten. FOURSWEETNIECES veered in at the start, was well placed just off the pace, raced inside for most of the turn then moved to the two path,
chased under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. EZEE ENOUGH was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the
turn, spun four wide into the stretch under the whip, dropped back passing the three-sixteenths and faltered. STANG'S GALAXY drifted out at the start and
was off a bit slow, moved up to dispute the pace on the outside, dropped back while floating from the three path to the five path on the turn, came six wide
into the stretch and stopped.

Footnotes
LIMAGE went three wide on the first turn, settled nicely off the pace, was roused while inside on the far turn, rallied to the lead while swinging three wide
into the stretch then quickly shook clear, responded well in the final furlong and held under steady urging. TRUST IN LOVE broke in and bumped with a foe,
was taken in hand early then reserved on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip, moved out in pursuit of the
leader around the three-sixteenths, gained into the final furlong and finished willingly for the place. PASSPORT REQUIRED went around the first turn in the
two path, settled off the pace, was asked while three to four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, chased the winner in the drive and lacked
the needed kick while able to get the show. STRICT VOW broke awkwardly and a step slow, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was
roused while four wide on the far turn, gained six wide into the stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong and weakened. BLAZING HERO broke out
and bumped soundly with a rival at the start, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, settled at the back, was urged along while four wide on the far turn
and failed to threaten. TUPELO HON E was bumped solidly at the start then forced into another foe, saved ground on the first turn, settled outside on the
backstretch, went three wide on the far turn, came five to six wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. GOTTABEGOLDEN moved in early, rounded the first
turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was urged along while inside on the far turn and failed to respond. DABBLIN CHANNEL bumped soundly with
rivals on both sides at the start, went three wide on both turns and was no factor. LEMON DROP TWIST set the pace on the inside, moved clear under
urging on the final turn, lost the lead into the stretch and stopped. CRY LIKE A BABY went two to three wide on the first turn, moved up to prompt the pace
on the outside, came up empty in the two to three path on the far turn and retreated. (Rail at 22 Feet)

Footnotes
MI CHACHIS INTENTA broke outwardly then took back and shifted nearer the rail while reserved at the tail, went in the two then three path on the turn still
trailing into the stretch, angled six wide just past the quarter pole, drifted out under left-handed urging in mid-stretch, was corrected and still drifted out but
rallied to the lead late and held to the wire. LIZZARIO was forced out a bit at the start, settled outside toward the rear up the backstretch, took closer order
four then five wide on the turn, struck the lead in upper stretch, drifted in under first left- then right-handed urging while in the clear, was overtaken late but
fought back gamely. BELMAR BEAUTY went to the lead soon after the start, was overtaken before the opening furlong was completed but still pressed
inside before being allowed to challenge and retake a narrow lead into the turn, raced on or just off the rail inside foes through that bend, could not kick on
with the top pair in the stretch but preserved show honors. LA NEGRA NOCHE broke outwardly then was moderately encouraged to the lead racing two
paths removed from the rail, vied between runners two to three wide on the turn then weakened in the stretch. IKE LIKES broke a half step slowly and
inwardly, switched off the rail and pulled against restraint while keen to run on in the two to three path up the backstretch, continued behind foes from off the
rail into the stretch and had no rally. LUNA GO LUNA came out a tad at the start, attended the pace outside runners three to four wide into the turn then
between rivals late on that bend, began to weaken by the head of the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
DIAMOND CRAZY settled mid-pack off the leaders racing inside, saved ground on the turn, was given mild encouragement past the five-sixteenths, came
out in upper stretch to move between foes, struck the lead past the furlong marker and edged clear while kept to task late. ROCKIN SUNDAY stalked the
leading pair from off the inside entering the turn in the two path, edged closer three then four deep the rest of that bend before striking the lead past the
quarter pole, was just clear then challenged by the aforementioned, fought on gamely to be second best. REBECCAS TRUTH raced outside foes off the
early leaders, went in the three path through the turn edging closer late on that bend, angled five deep past the quarter pole within striking distance but
could not sustain the effort and flattened out. ONETWOMANYROCKETS broke outwardly just a bit, settled at the rear well back off the leaders, saved
ground on or just off the rail on the turn, swung seven wide leaving that bend and improved position in the lane while no threat to the top ones. SILVER
SQUALL was forwardly-placed soon after the start to set the pace with pressure from an outside rival while racing off the inside early, went in the two path
still on a narrow lead through the turn, edged just clear leaving that bend but faltered and faded once headed. LINDA'S LEGACY bobbled just slightly at the
start, raced between foes heading to the turn dropping back and appearing to be getting out a bit entering that bend, thereupon switched out to the four path
through the remainder and failed to make a bid. WHODATWHODAT broke on top then settled into stride pressing outside a foe, applied a bit more pressure
racing about three wide into the turn, gave way in upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
ALTA'S AWARD stalked the pacesetter from outside three wide in the early going, edged closer willingly up the backstretch, took a narrow lead outside the
five-sixteenths, was shaken up in upper stretch, edged away through the lane under just moderate urging late once safe. KIZZY B was caught four wide into
the first turn, settled into stride easing back off the leading pair early on that bend content to stalk from outside foes, advanced still under a hold heading into
the far turn, made a mild bid four abreast past the five-sixteenths, could not kick on with the winner but was clearly second best. PIECE OF MY HEART
broke on top and set the pace inside racing in the clear early, faced some pressure into the far turn, was challenged past the three-eighths, lost ground to
the top two in upper stretch but switched on and kept on to preserve show honors. JOHNNIE MERLE (IRE) broke a step slowly then settled at the rear along
the inside early, edged closer into the far turn going in about the two path on that bend, split foes coming into upper stretch then evened out thereafter.
ARTISTIC JEWLER stumbled at the start, recovered to track inside rivals behind the leaders, was closer up the backstretch into the far turn, asked for run
past the three-eighths pole but had no rally. TAKE CHARGE CECE broke a step slowly, was caught three wide between foes into the first turn, encouraged
along in the three path on the far turn, appeared to go wrong near the furlong marker, fell and was vanned off. Following a stewards' inquiry no action was
taken.

Footnotes
TRICKLE IN went to the front, set the pace on the inside, responded well when set down in upper stretch and maintained a safe advantage under a solid
hand ride and several taps of a down-turned whip. GINSENG was rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted behind the vanguard on the far turn, was
asked in the two path at the quarter-pole, chased the winner in the stretch and was second best. WEXX broke open the front of her stall door prior to the
start, went three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, vied two to three wide under urging on the far turn, dropped back under a drive in
upper stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker and weakened but was clear for the show. LADY JENNEVIERE bumped with a rival at the start, went three
wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was roused while three then four wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. DUPLICITOUS broke a step slow, was taken under tight restraint early, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, was reserved off the
pace, raced inside to the two path under urging on the far turn and failed to rally. SKYGAZE went four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside,
was coaxed along while three to four wide on the far turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and capitulated. SENTIMENTALJOURNEY went
three to four wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under urging leaving the backstretch, went four then five wide on the far turn, dropped
back while six wide into the stretch and had nothing left. SUMMER EXPRESS went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was urged along
while three then four wide on the far turn, moved out near the sixteenth-pole and was no factor. TIZ SUSAN ANN broke in and hit the gate then bumped with
a foe, went three wide on the first turn, was rated off the pace, went three wide under urging on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and retreated.
INTO HUMOR saved ground on the first turn, settled last but one, went around the far turn in the two path and showed little. (Rail at 22 Feet)

Footnotes
CAPTAIN TYREE went around the first turn in the three then four path, stalked the pace on the outside, took the lead in the three to four path on the far
turn, moved clear outside the quarter-pole, drifted inward in upper stretch then was asked at the three-sixteenths, came out some when given two cracks of
a left-handed whip at the furlong marker then was placed under a hand ride to the wire while much the best. DUTCHMAN broke a step slow, went four to
five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while five wide on the far turn and safely secured the place while no match for the winner.
HANSEN'S HOLIDAY went three wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace, raced four wide early on the far turn, was asked while dropping to the two
path around the three-eighths then drafted for several strides, was put back to urging while shifting three wide around the five-sixteenths, came four wide
into the stretch then shifted out a path more and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. SHANIKO'S SECRET went three wide on the first turn,
settled towards the back, moved out leaving the backstretch, was urged along while three to four wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. FROM NOW
ON was rated inside on the first turn, settled off the pace on the backstretch, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, saved ground on the far turn and
came up empty. IDE B A CLASSIC went two then three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, rounded the far turn in the two path under urging
and failed to respond. ROLLWITHIT was taken up at the start and off a bit slow, went four then five wide on the first turn, swerved out entering the
backstretch, settled on the outside, was urged along while six wide on the far turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and was no factor. EL TRISTAN broke out
at the start, set the pace in the two path, lost the lead with three furlongs to run, dropped back while three wide into the stretch and stopped.
