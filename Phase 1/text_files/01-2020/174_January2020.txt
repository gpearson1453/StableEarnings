CEDARS OF LEBANON (IRE) zipped to a clear lead early, set the pace two wide, turned back rivals into the stretch, edged away to mid stretch and
remained clear driving. SECRET PARANOIA chased the winner from the rail to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but was not threatened for second.
IT GIRL broke a bit slow, had no speed, was three wide to the stretch but did not rally. ROYAL LOOKIN also had no speed, raced in the two path to the
stretch then also lacked a response in the drive. D'S TWO THUMBS UP threw her head and hopped at the start to be behind about six lengths then was
never a factor. NINNAVEE chased the pace outside of the runnerup and two wide to the stretch then gave out.

TEMPLE VIEW pressed the pace to the second turn, bid two wide to the stretch, got to terms in mid stretch but could not shake loose and dugt determinedly
to prevail. TURNAROUND set all the pace from the rail to the stretch, battled when hooked by the winner but could not hold that one off. KOA CAT trailed to
the second turn, bid three then four wide to the stretch and finished in a late rally. TYPHOON HARRY settled mid pack to the second turn, raced two then
three wide to the stretch then was making a mild bid but was outfinished. UR NOT MY PRESIDNT also was settled to the half, saved ground on the second
turn then closed some ground but too late. TASTE'S LEGEND stalked the pace to the half, shifted off the rail on the second turn then closed the gap without
threatening.

driving. GIANT MARK pressed the winner to the second turn, moved alongside two wide to challenge but got outkicked to mid stretch then dug in
determinedly to hold second. ON THE KEY broke a bit slow and trailed to the second turn, bid two then three wide then swung out widest for the drive,
rallied but missed the place. MR. Q allowed to settle to the half, saved ground on the second turn, responded to pressure to mid stretch but hung in the final
sixteenth. CAROLINA ISLAND chased the winner two then three wide to the stretch then tired.

Footnotes
MERCY RULE set the pace in hand to the turn, was off the rail to the stretch, responded when set down and held driving. IVORIAN chased the winner from
the rail to the stretch, could not catch that one but finished willingly to hold off RED STAR for the place. RED STAR The latter had no speed, raced two wide
to the stretch, shifted out in upper stretch, closed steadily and missed the place by a hair. CLIFTON HOLLOW was bumped at the start then was rank and
hard to place in the opening furlong, chased the pace to the turn, was two wide to the stretch then finished in a mild rally. SECOND BOLD tracked the pace
to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch but could not make an impact late. SHINER'S CODE got outsprinted early then was rank off heels at the half
mile pole, raced four wide into the turn but had to check in traffic at the five sixteenths, responded when set down for the drive and finished in a mild rally.
SOUGHT BAI was also outsprinted to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. EURODOLLAR had no speed, was
forced to circle rivals five wide to the stretch and did not threaten. MY SMALL WORLD had no speed and was not a factor. RI' PIN SNAP pressed the
winner two then three wide to the stretch then tired. PEGASUS SPRINT was under urging in the opening furlong but dropped back on the turn and gave out
in the stretch.
