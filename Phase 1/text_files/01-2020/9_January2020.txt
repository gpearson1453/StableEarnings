ON PURPOSE set all pace, well handled, roused stretch, geared down as much best through the final sixteenth. KEEP THIS KITTEN chased winner to turn,
drifted out badly, staying on for place. WORTHAPRETTYPENNY pressed briefly, chased leaders, hold the show spot on the wire. EXCELERITA saved
ground throughout to no avail in the stretch run. EOWYN could not keep up to the stretch, passed tired ones. DEFY EXPECTATIONS broke well outside,
brief speed gave way thereafter. WICKED BETTY never in the hunt. LA INCOMODITA broke slow, rushed early, gave way from the turn.
