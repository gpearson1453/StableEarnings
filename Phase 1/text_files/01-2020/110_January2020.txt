PRIVATE PARTY racing inside, took the lead near quarter pole, drifted out mid stretch, was straightened away and drew off fully extend. BRIO MAN saved
ground and was drawing away from the others. STONE BANDIT set the pace in the four path, faded through the stretch. CHELIOS broke slowly, saved
ground and failed to menace. DODDSPRIVATELABEL, two wide, was never a serious threat. THOMAS KNIGHT raced wide and dropped back steadily.
SECRET SECRET, wide and just off the pace, had nothing left.
