past the five sixteenths pole, recovered stride midway on the turn and raced evenly down the lane. FATHER DON broke outward to make contact with
Jacob T then pressured the early pace inside, dropped back toward the quarter pole, rounded the turn at the rail then flattened out the final sixteenth.

finished evenly. ROLLING BROOK gave chase and saved ground then weakened from the top of the lane. HEARTLAND HIT gave chase toward the

SHUDDAWUDDACUDDA took quick control and rated the pace, came under pressure midway on the turn and widened through the lane. ZEP chased the
pace and came through the turn in the three path then flattened stride inside the final sixteenth. LUCKY LEONARD chased the pace outside, rounded the
turn in the five path and showed little further the final sixteenth. REDBULLETWARRIOR chased the pace off the rail, could only improve his position and
appeared a bit sore upon return. CONQUISTODOR FUEGO chased the pace outside, raced in the five path of the turn and passed rivals down the lane.
FLANAGAN gave early chase toward mid track then saved ground on the turn. ORIOLES MAGIC chased the pace just off the rail then weakened leaving
the turn. STALWART HUMOR gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn in the four path then weakened.

Footnotes
SUPER GARNER rated the pace inside and was pressured toward the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail rounding the far turn then
dug in under determined handling to ward off the stretch challenge of MORNING MUSE, who settled off the pace toward the inside then bid nearing the
seven sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn then hung at the girth of the winner through the lane. PRAISE THE
MOON settled off the pace toward the inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and finished evenly. CRAZED raced
in the four and five paths the first turn then bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little more. STAR HAWK raced in
the six path the first turn and entered the backstretch outside, bid leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and showed little
more. SOUTHERN BARBECUE showed little response through the backstretch. WATSON steadied through the first turn and raced outside into the
backstretch and provided no bid. MIGHTY BOP was not a factor.

Footnotes
AFFIX saved ground off the pace the opening turn then raced outside into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, improved in the four path of
the far turn then dug in for the lead later yards and raced clear under the wire. BLACK STEEL stalked the pace off the rail then challenged nearing the five
sixteenths pole, took the lead two deep past the quarter pole, dueled clear toward the head of the lane but was caught flattening stride later yards.
SEVENTYSEVEN FORCE saved ground well off the early pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, entered the far turn in the three path, angled to the
seven path leaving the turn and was along for third the final strides. GIANT VIKING rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths
pole, was caught at the rail past the quarter then dropped back while weakening into the lane. OWL RUN settled off the pace in the four path, picked up the
chase past the three eighths pole then flattened stride at the rail rounding the far turn. HOMER J stalked the early pace in the three path then gave chase
from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed no response down the lane. LIME HUT was never in contention and not
encouraged.

Footnotes
CHANNEL SURFING saved ground off the pace then bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, took aim in the four path approaching the top of the lane, took
the lead just inside the eighth pole then dueled clear later yards. FOXY GATOR raced off the pace about the three path then bid nearing the three eighths
pole, came through the far turn in the five path and finished well to take second the final yards. BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) settled well back in the three and
four paths the opening turn then bid nearing the three eighths pole, improved off the rail rounding the far turn, challenged past the eighth pole but gave way
mid-stretch and flattened late yards. FOXY JOXY stalked the pace in the three path then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead two deep into
the far turn but was caught past the eighth pole and flattened stride. GIMME KIMMY saved ground off the pace, showed only mild response near the rail on
the far turn then angled widest into the lane. EARNED THE SHOT saved ground off the pace the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid toward
the seven sixteenths pole but flattened stride in the four path of the far turn. ELLIE'S CORK was not a factor. MARY'S LISTED NEXT angled to the inside to
rate the pace, came under pressure past the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail into the far turn then gave way approaching the top of the stretch.
LIDDYUP was not a factor.
