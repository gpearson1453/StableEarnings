TOTAL ACCESS , bumped by DETERMINED CHANCE leaving the starting gate, saved ground around the turn, found room along the rail in the stretch
drive and was up at the wire. DETERMINED CHANCE bumped the winner when bearing in at the break, sprinted to a clear lead mid way down the
backstretch, drifted off the rail turning for home and drifted out near the sixteenth pole when tiring. TWO DOORS DOWN , three deep on the turn, floated to
the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. TABLE MAX lacked speed, swung to the six path in upper stretch and passed tired foes. MAKE US
SMILE , three wide on the turn, chased the pace and gave way late. EJE GAMA chased the pace racing in the two path on the turn and weakened.
SINCERE MAN , two wide on the turn, drifted out a bit turning for home then drifted in near the eighth pole.

ANKLE MONITOR settled towards the inside and off of a contested early pace, eased out around the turn and took closer order past the three eighths,
came under urging soon after while about five wide into the stretch, made a grinding run under strong handling, switched over to his left lead in the final
yards and just got up. NAUGHTY THOUGHTS disputed the pace to the inside of PRINCESS CADEY while under a rating hold, moved to a short lead
leaving the quarter pole, kicked clear after being put to a drive, wandered out several paths inside the sixteenth marker, dug in when collared but wasn't
quite good enough. PRINCESS CADEY vied outside NAUGHTY THOUGHTS and held a slim lead mid turn, kept up the fight to about the three sixteenths
then faded. LONGLEGGEDLAVERNE , off the pace, was ridden along mid turn, failed to respond and dropped back.

HILL SHADOW bore in leaving the starting gate, moved up in the two path leaving the turn, remained in the two path between horses through the stretch,
gained the lead near the sixteenth pole and determinedly prevailed. MILITARY HOP , five deep around the turn, reached a striking position in upper stretch
and flattened out. SUCCESSFUL ZIP disputed the pace while saving ground, held the lead in mid stretch and weakened in the drive. BUDDY'S RUN , in
close quarters leaving the starting gate, advanced along the rail in upper stretch then steadied in tight quarters near the eighth pole. MASAI MAN disputed
the early pace outside SUCCESSFUL ZIP and weakened through the stretch. TIME FLIES BY , behind horses mid way on the turn, swung to the five path
leaving the bend and passed tired horses. MICE AND MEN , rated outside horses down the backstretch, raced four wide on the turn and gave way.
KOSHER KONTRACT chased the pace three wide and gave way. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the stretch run but no action was taken.

HARPERS FIRST RIDE settled off the pace, angled out around the turn, circled six wide into the stretch, closed determinedly under stout pressure and
forged ahead in the final yards. TAPPIN CAT pulled his way to a slim lead in the two path and to the inside of MIDNIGHT ACT, sparred under rating before
going clear heading to the turn, continued under rating two wide and held off challenges nearing the lane, edged back away after being put to a drive, drifted
out in deep stretch and just failed in a gritty effort. TOUGHEST 'OMBRE stalked three wide, was under pressure four wide and with aim into the lane,
churned on willingly and got the show. FORT PECK , in tight at the break, recovered and edged up inside to stalk, took closer order into lane failed to match
strides nearing mid stretch but kept giving effort to the line. MIDNIGHT ACT , three wide outside TAPPIN CAT early on, stalked around the turn, made a
mild rebid then gave way grudgingly in the drive. HAMMERIN AAMER , taken to rate, raced to the inside of a rival mid turn, awaited room approaching the
stretch, swung out near the three sixteenths but came up empty.

ITS A JOURNEY saved ground and was nudged along into the turn, awaited some room mid turn, eased out in the stretch, moved up between runners in
mid stretch, shifted out with aim on WARM soon after, forged ahead under left handed rousing and drew clear. WARM keen outside rivals and with the early
pace, pulled her way clear and dropped in to set a rated pace two wide, moved away under drive leaving the three sixteenths, was confronted heading to
the sixteenth pole but failed to last. MONACO PRINCESS , three to four wide stalking the pace, chased into the lane, drifted late but managed to save the
show. LUCY'S TOWN , bumped at the break, lagged off the pace and was under urging leaving the far turn, circled five wide into the lane, made some
progress leaving the eighth pole but flattened out late. LADY VICKI prompted the pace while saving ground, was under pressure pursuing past the eighth
pole but came up empty. SETUBAL edged up between rivals early, chased off the rail mid turn, came four wide for the drive and gave way. CASSIDY AVE
vied between foes early, pursued to the far turn then dropped back.

Footnotes
TOO MUCH MINUTIA chased between rivals, angled in for the drive, bid to the inside of LADY LOOSE in mid stretch, kicked clear approaching the
sixteenth marker and held firm under a steady drive. CHICKEN DINNER broke a step slow, recovered and raced four wide outside rivals, circled five wide
into the lane and continued willingly to gain the place. LADY LOOSE sped clear early, set the pace two wide, was joined from the rail in mid stretch and
faded. DAMISELA chased inside, eased out for the run around the turn, raced three wide into the stretch, had aim near the furlong grounds but came up
empty. VAMPISH , three wide chasing the early pace, raced failed to kick on while four wide between runners approaching the stretch and gave way. PRISS
failed to menace. ALPHABETTING , urged along while saving ground, pursued to the quarter pole and gave way.
