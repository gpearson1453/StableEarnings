from that point and dug in determinedly leaving the far turn to edge clear of DISTINCT APPROVAL, who stalked the pace two deep then challenged from
the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms from that point to mid-stretch, though, flattened stride later yards. FACEY'S SISTER rounded the opening turn
about the five path then took a brief lead four wide nearing the seven sixteenths pole, was promptly met at even terms and dueled to the middle of the far

eighths pole and was blocked passing the half mile pole, started a bid past the three eighths, rounded the far turn in the four path but showed little more.
CORY'S CUTIE raced well off the pace and off the rail the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid past the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn

WISPER FREEDOM rated a slim lead inside and dueled at even terms leaving the nine sixteenths pole, inched clear past the quarter pole then dug in under
steady encouragement to draw away later yards. MASTER YOO saved ground just off the pace then picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole,
improved at the rail through the far turn but proved no match the final sixteenth. VILLAGE PRINCE rounded the opening turn in the five path and raced
outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn six wide and got up for third the final stride. THEKIDSBACK
settled off the pace in the three and four paths and raced close into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the six
path and was outfinished for third late. AZZEDINE (FR) raced with the pace two deep and challenged at even terms leaving the nine sixteenths pole, but,
dropped back toward the quarter and flattened out in the lane. VERN H raced with the pace three wide then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole,
though, weakened four wide on the far turn.

ABSENCEISPRESENCE dropped back from early contention and saved ground, eased out with a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, progressed
steadily to take the lead four wide midway on the far turn, angled in while drawing clear entering the stretch and held on well. SHARPIN rated a short lead
inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the advantage at the rail midway on the far turn, dropped back into the stretch and
settled for second best. TIZ JOHNNIE stalked the pace at the rail the first turn then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took aim in the three path at the
quarter pole, contested at a close disadvantage through the turn but was shuffled back and bobbled entering the stretch and couldn't recover. FRENCH
NOUGET raced off the pace in the three and four paths then challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dropped back from between horses midway on
the far turn then weakened. DROPS AND BUCKETS raced well back. DEMAY'S CASTLE stalked the pace off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the three
eighths pole then faded into the far turn. Following an objection against the riders of Absenceispresence and Sharpin, lodged by the rider of Tiz Johnnie, the
stewards decided on no action.

Footnotes
MALIBU SPLASH gave chase and rounded the turn in the three path then dug in from the top of the lane to take the nod through the final strides. RUSH
EXPRESS set a pressured pace inside, dug in under steady urging leaving the turn but was caught the final strides. WALKNTHEPLANK raced off the pace
through the backstretch then bid nearing the quarter pole, came through the turn about the four path and was along for third inside the sixteenth pole. SING
FROSTY gave chase inside and finished evenly. THUNDEROUS chased the pace, rounded the turn about the three path and finished evenly. SPOOKY
MOON gave chase and rounded the turn in the six path then passed rivals in an even finish. OUT ONA LIMB chased the pace through the backstretch,
rounded the turn in the three path and showed little more. MARLEESBEEBEE hesitated at the break then rushed toward contention, raced at the rail on the
turn then weakened. LIZZIE'S LAST gave chase and rounded the turn off the rail. LILBITSOFDRAMA loped along. Due to an equipment malfunction, this
race was hand timed.

Footnotes
CHARITABLE SPENNY took the lead nearing the nine sixteenths pole and rated the pace, came under pressure past the five sixteenths, dueled clear into
the stretch, drifted a bit mid-stretch but dug in under steady handling to hold well. BRAVE NATIVE settled off the pace inside, bid approaching the three
eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, came inside the drifting winner mid-stretch, couldn't match strides with that one but held on for second. MINI
BOLT saved ground off the pace then bid from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in range of the lead off the rail rounding the far turn but was outfinished in
the stretch duel for second. WHY ALL DA TIME raced well back inside the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, angled to the seven path through the
far turn and finished evenly to improve his position. BASKETBALL ZACH raced well back off the rail then bid past the three eighths pole, was blocked
nearing the head of the lane but came back to finish evenly. CANDY MAN ONE settled off the pace in the three and four paths, picked up the chase from
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn five wide and finished evenly. JACOB T raced off the pace inside the first turn then eased out into the
backstretch and bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn four wide and finished evenly. CHARITY HILLS showed little response.
RIDICULOUSNESS stalked the pace inside and gave chase leaving the first turn but was taken up past the five sixteenths pole and galloped to the finish.

Footnotes
ALLEN JR. settled off the pace toward the inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, dueled to even terms mid-stretch
and dug in determinedly to inch ahead through later yards. NAZCA MYSTERY rated the pace inside, was pressured toward the five sixteenths pole, drifted
a bit past the eighth pole, dug in to the winners' challenge mid-stretch but grudgingly yielded in a game stretch effort. JACKZILLA settled off the pace then
bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, angled to the three path in the upper stretch but flattened stride. CHESAPEAKE
CHARLIE rounded the opening turn in the five path then raced outside entering the backstretch, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the
four path of the far turn, drifted a bit leaving the far turn and showed little more. CHASE MY ACE was carried to the five path into the first turn, showed little
response through the backstretch, rounded the far turn just off the rail and could only improve his position. EASTER ENTOURAGE stalked the early pace
two deep then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though, faded rounding the far turn. MIO'S LONG TERM stalked the earlier pace three wide then
faded past the three eighths pole. GOVERNOR MACHEN drifted into the first turn, was never a factor, though, galloped to the finish.

EMPRESS HEART loaded reluctantly then closed to the lead nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced clear into the turn and dug in under steady stretch
handling to hold on. DIAMOND TRAIN chased the pace inside and rounded the turn two deep, dug in from the top of the lane to duel for second and was
gaining on the winner. HEDGE BURNER gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn in the five path then outfinished in the stretch duel for
second. CHARITABLE MISS gave chase toward the inside and rounded the turn at the rail, was boxed in leaving the turn but dug in through the lane to
finish well. ABUNDANT STORY gave chase and raced in the six path of the turn then finished evenly. CLASSY RHAPSODY pressured the pace through
the backstretch and raced in range in the three path of the turn before weakening. DAKOTA MIST broke a step slow then bid leaving the three eighths pole,
rounded the turn in the three path and had little left. INSIDIOUS CAT was never a factor. CIVIL STONES set the early pace off the rail then gave chase
nearing the five sixteenths pole, but, faded at the rail rounding the far turn.
