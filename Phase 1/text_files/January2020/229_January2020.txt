Footnotes
TEDDY'S HONOR, prominent four wide in the opening stages attending the pace, angled inwards a bit racing into the turn while pressing the pace outside
foes, went clear leaving the midway point of the turn and held sway on a safe margin to the end under right handed pressure. ZIEG vied for command
between foes into the turn and continued with a steady effort to prove best of the others. POZNAN, three deep between foes tracking just off the first flight
on the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path nearing the lane but had no final kick. DONNERSBERG tracked off the first flight inside foes in the
opening quarter, shifted out four wide racing into the faded but steadily. ROGUE RAGE, urged to brief contention inside foes, steadily faded nearing the
lane. DE KOONING, off a step slowly, tracked just off the first flight five wide, then four wide racing to the turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. WANNA
WOW YOU was always outrun.

Footnotes
STREET LEGACY, reserved last to the backstretch, gathered momentum nearing the far turn to advance outside rivals, shifted to the four path leaving the
midway point of the far turn while looming outside the leaders, took charge in that path racing into upper stretch, went well clear in the closing stages under
mild urging and finished on his own courage once the issue was decided. CHAMPIONSHIP ALLEY was rated off the second flight while angling to the inside
racing to the backstretch, continued under light rating briefly awaiting an opening racing into the far turn, angled outside foes to race five wide into upper
stretch and proved best of the others. BLAME THE MAKERS tracked off the leaders outside a rival in the opening half, shifted out midway through the far
turn to bid for command three deep between rivals racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. MIKE MIKE, forwardly placed tracking just off
the pacesetter racing to the first turn, angled inside that foe entering the backstretch, was prompted to press the issue inside a rival racing into the far turn,
dueled inside foes to upper stretch and gave way. ARBA, urged to the lead along the rail racing to the first turn, switched off the inside entering the
backstretch while dictating the pace on a narrow margin, dueled for command outside a rival nearing the far turn, pressed between foes into the far turn and
gave way nearing upper stretch. HEX angled to the inside tracking off the first flight, saved ground into the second bend and came up empty nearing the
lane. EXCELLENT MARK was scratched just before the start after being cast in the gate.

Footnotes
RATTLESNAKEROSE was urged to gain a clear advantage in the opening stages racing a bit off the rail, held sway on her own courage maintaining a
comfortable advantage through the turn, then came under firm right handed pressure racing through the stretch to maintain the advantage under firm
handling. THREE ILLUSIONS tracked the leaders from out of striking distance inside foes in the opening stages, saved ground through the turn advancing
on the pacesetter, shifted out entering upper stretch while being roused to close the gap but was always only second best. LUNA AZTECA tracked the
leaders five wide in second flight early, shifted inwards racing into the turn to make brief progress three deep nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the
closing stages. MYSTIQUE ARTISTE shifted inwards at the start, was rated tracking off the second flight while angling to the rail racing through the
backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and continued evenly inside foes late. ODACHI, urged between rivals making brief pursuit of the pacesetter,
gave way between foes leaving the midway point of the turn. FUN AND GAMES stumbled at the start, recovered quickly to be a brief factor three deep
between foes pursuing the leader but faded early. FORTY'S SWEETHEART angled to the inside early while dropping well off the pace and proved no
threat. NORTHERN WIND broke a step slowly and trailed the field.

Footnotes
I SAY I PLAY broke readily to gain terms with a rival prompting the pace racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue to go clear racing into upper stretch
and held sway to the end under firm hand urging. MAYITO was rated inside foes stalking just off the first flight to the far turn, switched out three deep racing
into upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. IT'S MANDATORY, reserved off the second flight while angling inwards to race
between foes in the opening half, was urged to split foes nearing upper stretch, angled out four wide entering the lane and finished willingly. SPEAKERIT,
urged to prompt the pace inside the eventual winner from the outset, dueled for command into the far turn to upper stretch and gave way. PINAR tracked off
the second flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch and gained some position in an even effort. FLORIDA EXPRESS tracked off the second
flight between foes racing to the far turn and faded into the stretch. DANVILLE tracked off the second flight outside foes in early stages, angled out five wide
racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance, continued widest through the second bend, shifted inwards bumping GATOR POSSE racing into
upper stretch and quickly came up empty. SECRET MAGICIAN, urged to gain a forward placing three deep between foes racing to the backstretch tracking
just off the leaders, was urged to make a brief bid in that path entering the far turn but soon gave way. MASTERIO, restless in the gate, broke slowly, settled
last, shifted out on the backstretcch, was caught wide nearing the far turn and soon dropped out. GATOR POSSE, caught four wide to the backstretch
tracking just off the leaders, was prompted to make a brief bid between foes in that path on the far turn, was bumped racing into upper stretch and quickly
gave way.

Footnotes
DILETTANTE, urged to dispute the pace inside a rival from the outset while shifting a bit off the rail, edged forward to a narrow advantage racing into upper
stretch and was kept to firm left handed pressure to maintain a safe margin. NATIVE HAWK, prominent outside foes from the outset, angled inwards
pressing the issue outside the eventual winner racing into the turn, proved no match in the closing stages but continued with a steady effort to prove best of
the others. FOX ROX ducked out at the start bumping JOSIE'S RIDDLE, was collected off that foe while angling to the rail, tracked just off the leaders racing
into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and finished evenly inside foes. JOSIE'S RIDDLE, bumped from both sides, then squeezed back at the start,
settled into stride near the inside, shifted out nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to gain some position between foes late. FORWARD
MOTION ducked inwards bumping JOSIE'S RIDDLE, tracked off the first flight between foes, shifted out racing into the turn to lodge a brief, three wide bid
nearing upper stretch but faded in late stages. WING AND WHEEL tracked off the first flight racing four wide to the turn and dropped out early.

Footnotes
UPPER CROWN was urged to gain a narrow advantage racing to the first turn while shifting to the three path racing into the backstretch, turned back
several challengers racing into the far turn, forged clear into upper stretch and was kept to some right handed pressure to prove best. BOX CANDY tracked
just off the pacesetter inside foes racing to the backstretch, loomed inside the eventual winner nearing the far turn, saved ground while losing position to that
foe on the far turn but continued with a steady effort to edge rivals for the place honors late. DIG IN tracked just off the first flight four wide, then three wide
between foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance shifting out four wide on the far turn and continued with interest in that path to edge rivals
for a share nearing the wire. THE EXCEPTION, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the leaders to the backstretch, continued in pursuit of the
eventual winner to upper stretch and weakened late. BROWN ESSENCE, urged three wide between foes into the first turn prompting the winner's pace,
pressed the issue to the far turn and gave way into the lane. OLLYSILVEREXPRESS, steadied out of close quarters racing into the first turn and never
gained contention. FAMILIAR DREAM tracked off the first flight four wide between foes racing to the backstretch but dropped out early. ONEWAYTICKET,
off slowly, was urged from the outset to regain contention racing six wide into the first turn and soon retreated. SPINOS, a bit rank against restraint along the
inside early, was prompted to make brief progress between foes just off the inside racing into the backstretch but emptied out early. FOURTH QUARTER,
off slowly, was urged to terms with the leaders racing five wide between foes into the first turn, continued in that path to the backstretch but was spent after
a half.

Footnotes
SHES DYNOMITE angled in sharply racing to the first turn to gain a forward placing, shifted off the rail racing to the backstretch tracking the pacesetter from
just out of striking distance, shifted three deep racing into upper stretch to challenge for command in tandem with a rival and just edged that foe in the
closing stages under firm encouragement. BELLA BELLA, in touch with the leaders between foes racing to the first turn, conceded some position to those
foes while angling to the inside racing into the backstretch, tracked just off the leaders to the far turn, advanced along the rail to challenge for command
inside the leaders nearing midstretch, gained a narrow advantage late but just failed to contain the winner. BETTER YET ducked inwards at the start, was
righted to track off the second flight between rivals, steadily gained position between foes, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch and edged rivals
for a share. TOUCHET tracked off the leaders a bit off the inside into the backstretch, was prompted to advance nearing upper stretch and continued evenly
three deep between rivals in the final stages. QUEEN ROSE settled along the rail in the opening half, saved ground on the far turn, then shifted to improve
position between foes just off the inside in the last furlong. ALABAMA BOUND, urged to the lead outside foes racing to the first turn, went clear nearing the
backstretch, set the pace on a clear margin to upper stretch and gave out abruptly once headed by the top pair. BAR LIBRE (IRE), reserved off the second
flight along the inside, was prompted to advance inside foes nearing the lane but came up empty into upper stretch. ZAO'S DREAMS tracked off the second
flight outside foes racing to the far turn, was fanned five wide and steadily faded into the lane. SECRET O'LIFE tracked off the leaders between foes to the
backstretch but retreated early. EYERISH INSPIRED, off slowly, was shut off at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RISEN CHANGE was settled off the second flight while angling inwards in the opening stages, shifted out racing into the turn advancing four wide,
continued in that path to upper stretch and just wore down the leaders to prevail in time under firm left handed pressure. MY GIRL SWEET tracked just off
the leaders three deep on the backstretch, loomed outside the pacesetter in that path nearing upper stretch, shifted inwards disputing the issue past
midstretch and was just outfinished. HIFALUTIN, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside that foe
racing into the turn to gain the advantage on the turn, dueled for command into upper stretch and resisted grudgingly to the end. CASCABELL QUEEN,
urged to the lead along the inside in the opening quarter, dueled for command racing into the turn and weakened in the drive. SHARON'S LAW, bumped
soundly at the start, settled between foes in the last flight, angled out six wide racing into upper stretch and found her best stride in the closing stages to
gain some position. SANSA stumbled at the start, then shifted abruptly into the path of SHARON'S LAW bumping that rival, was collected to track well off
the second flight, angled out five wide racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid. SPITFIRE SUZIE tracked off the first flight along the inside
racing to the turn, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch and proved empty late. OHIO STORM tracked off the second flight between foes racing to
the turn but offered no rally. CAT CAY never seriously menaced. LITTLE MS BROADWAY, urged to gain a forward placing between foes in the opening
quarter, faded from contention early. SWEET LEAF stumbled at the start, raced wide to the turn and soon dropped out. DRILL'S GIRL, restless, dropped out
of contention early, was soon outdistanced while being gathered up by her rider, then walked off the course under her own power.

Footnotes
PAINTED IMAGE was prompted to a forward placing along the rail in the opening stages, switched out conceding the lead to a rival racing into the
backstretch prompting that foe, took over nearing upper stretch and just maintained the advantage to the end under firm handling. JOST SAYIN, off a step
slowly, was settled off the second flight along the rail, saved ground through the far turn, then advanced willingly inside foes to challenge for command
nearing the wire. KITTEN'S SHADOW, held up just off the leaders racing to the first turn, steadily gained position between foes in second flight advancing
on those foes racing into the far turn, shifted out a bit to bid three deep between foes and continued willingly while just outkicked by the top pair. FEELING
GOOD tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, then was prompted to gain position between foes while shifting out four wide
through the stretch. WHISPERING WANDA settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and made some
belated progress. PURO BLANCO, prompted to a forward placing between foes, tracked just off the first flight along the inside through the backstretch,
advanced in tandem with several rivals to lodge a brief bid between foes just off the inside in upper stretch but proved empty late. TROPICAL FROSTY
tracked outside foes in second flight in the opening half, was prompted to advance in tandem with several rivals to lodge a four wide bid in upper stretch but
soon gave way. SCOWLING RIDGE, urged to gain the lead outside foes, angled to the rail on the first turn, dueled for command inside the eventual winner
into the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. MALLIE CRAMP settled along the inside early and failed to menace. HALO'S FOR DUDE proved no
factor.
