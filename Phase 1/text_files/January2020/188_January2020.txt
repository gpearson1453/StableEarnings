unhurried to the turn, rallied between horses for show. FLAT OUT BLING well placed, never far back throughout, raced evenly, lacked bid. RUBATO with
pace to the stretch, short lead, faltered in late going. THIS IS ME never a real menace. CODE BLU brief foot, stopped. BENNETT ALAN ducked in gap,
never close. RAISING DREAMS brief foot, stopped. MASTER VOLUME no speed to turn, middle move outside used up, gave way. MRWILLOUGHBY
lugging in while hard to control throughout, far back crossed the finish walked back.

Footnotes
JOEY B raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane, under a long drive down the lane while between horses and prevailed in the final stages.
GOLDEN GIFT trailed the field early on, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid three wide under a long drive but did not have enough in the final
stages. MAN OF BLUES was bumped at the start, chased the pace early, made a bid four wide nearing the lane, took over and inched ahead in the stretch
but yielded in the late stages. SEVENHEARTSWARRIOR was slow at the start and raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane and finished
willingly down the lane. DOUBLE DERINGER chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. GOT THE
NOTION set the pace early from the inside, stayed on the inside into the lane and gave way in the stretch drive. FAITHFUL NEIGHBOR tracked the pace
early three wide, inched ahead nearing the lane, was off the rail into the lane and faltered in the stretch. NOT CHOPPED LIVER was never a threat.
LAFLOWMYLAXBRO was steadied and checked along the far turn. TRUE TRUFFLE had early speed then folded up. SEEYALATERBYE broke poorly at
the start and was through after a half.
