Footnotes
VIXSINSFANTASTKFOX dueled inside for the lead, battled with GEEBERT on the turn, dug in gamely inside of that rival in the stretch drive and battled
back determinedly to prevail. GEEBERT dueled outside for the early lead, battled with the winner on the turn, put a head in front, dug in gamely outside in
the stretch drive and was outfinished late. DR VUNNO raced off the pace inside, then two wide on the turn, gained mildly on the rail in the stretch and
bested the others. WELL IN TUNE raced off the pace between rivals, came three wide into the lane and closed belatedly for fourth. MY DANZIG PARTNER
was bothered and forced to check at the start, then raced off the pace inside and had no rally. WEST FORK chased outside, raced three wide on the turn
and weakened. FIELD OFFICER raced off the pace outside a rival, went four wide on the turn and had no rally. FIRE ANT ducked in sharply at the gap after
the start causing the rider to lose the irons, he quickly recovered, then chased inside and tired. HOPE DRIVE raced three wide off the pace, four wide on the
turn, came five wide into the lane and failed to threaten. MOSSBAWN was outrun. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the start, the race was declared official.

Footnotes
PEGASUS RED, between rivals early then was left with rail, eased out entering stretch, caught the leader deep stretch and edged away. KETOS stumbled
leaving the gate, stalked two wide, took over and was clear on the turn, widen near mid stretch then weakened late. POLISHED STEEL steadied between
foes on the backstretch, raced two wide and was too late. FINAL RITUAL, in the four path while never far back, dropped back. VERY COLORFUL saved
ground and tired. SMART AND TOUGH set the early pace inside then had little left. ONLY THE TRUTH fell back after an alert start, raced wide and showed
little. SPECIAL SEASON (GB), very wide, was never a factor. CAPE MAY FERRY, STORMY HIGHWAY AND BOBBY'S SONG ALL INJURED
THEMSELVES IN THE STARTING GATE AND WERE ORDERED SCRATCHED ON THE ADVICE OF THE VETERINARIAN. CONSULATION DAILY
DOUBLES WERE PAID. POST TIME WAS DELAYED 9 MINUTES.

inside and had no late kick. NATALIE LA ROSE, wide and just off the pace, faded. RAPIDEZ saved ground and tired. BERBERSLILBRIEBRIE came out

and was not a factor. LUCKY MEETING took up leaving the gate, then showed little. RIO VISTA raced wide and dropped back steadily.

ALWAYS A QUEEN stalked outside, bid three wide on the turn, dueled into the lane, battled it out with PRESTO CHANGE O, dug in gamely outside of that
rival and prevailed late. PRESTO CHANGE O chased five wide early, bid entering the turn, dueled between rivals on the turn, dug in gamely inside of the
winner in the stretch drive and yielded grudgingly late. HEROIC OFFICER was bumped at the start, dueled three wide for the early lead, dueled inside on
the turn, weakened and held well for third. CURRENT SITUATION broke out bumping rivals at the start, tracked along the inside, moved up three wide on
the turn and closed mildly for fourth. HOPE TAKES OVER hopped and was off a bit slow, outrun early, advanced two wide on the turn and closed belatedly
inside. A RING THING chased four wide and tired. YOURINDENIAL raced off the pace inside and did not factor. HARDY JOJO dueled inside for the early
lead, then chased and gave way. GUMDROP'S CHICLET raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. GUNFIGHTER'S GIRL reared up badly at the
break and was off slowly, then outrun. PROUD SUPPORTER was bumped at the start, dueled two wide early, then chased and gave way on the turn. After
a Stewards' Inquiry into the start, the race was declared official.

Footnotes
SWEET AUGUST LADY took the lead entering chute as the horses left the starting gate twenty six minutes past scheduled post time, bore out on
backstretch, was straightened, set the pace in four path, opened a clear lead and maintained under a drive. IRON LILLY, bumped leaving the gate, was in
the five path of second flight and had no late gain. DOUBLE THE BET was three wide chasing, had no late kick. IF YOU ONLY KNEW, drifted in leaving the
gate, was between second flight, fell back on the turn but then was coming back late. NOT IN THE MOOD came in at the start bumping IRON LILLY into
TWITTER STORM, raced between foes and tired. HEART BEAT AWAY split rivals moving on the turn but failed to sustain her bid. DEREYA, very wide,
failed to menace. TWITTER STORM, bumped leaving the gate, had brief speed. RISQUE EXPRESS, outside and not far back, was finished leaving the
turn. HALLUCINATION, very wide, showed nothing. HARBOR WAY WAS ORDERED SCRATCHED ON THE ADVICE OF THE VETERARIAN. ALL
WAGERS ON HER, EXCEPT IN THE PICK SIX, WERE REFUNDED.

LITTLEMISSBUSINESS was in motion in the gate just prior to the start then lunged slightly at the break, raced three wide in second flight, fell back on the
turn, responded when set down, closed relentlessly and was just up. ROYALTY FOR LIFE, between second flight, took the lead near stretch, opened a long
lead with a furlong to run but was nailed on the wire. THATTA BOY GIRL, between foes early, moved to the rail near far the turn and had no late kick.
UNTOUCHABLE U broke slowly, as the horses left the starting gate twenty eight minutes past post time, raced between foes and tired.
SHEPLAYSTHEFIELD set the early pace just off the rail then faded through the stretch. LA CANDELITA saved ground and tired. TRUFFLESBERG, three
wide, failed to menace.

Footnotes
DEEP CANYON set a clear lead just off the rail and was never seriously challenged. GLORIOUS MYSTERY, between second flight, moved out wider into
stretch and had no gain. HAILEY'S WAY, outrun early, closed strongly between foes. POINT LOCKOUT, outside early, angled in through stretch and was
too late. LITTLE NECK, outside and just off the pace, tired. BESS raced wide while just off the pace then tired. WISE TRADE raced between foes on the
turn and through stretch and was being eased through the final sixteenth. BAAQEYA raced wide and failed to menace. BELLAMY CAT three and four wide,
failed to menace. DANCINGTHEHNYDAWAY, between foes and just off the pace, tired. TOMBOY TUFF had only brief speed. SUGAR INCLUDED was far
back.
