Footnotes
BOSTON CADILLAC showed good speed and set the clear pace, controlled the action while inside to the two path on the turn, was asked a bit coming to
the quarter-pole, drew off under a moderate hand ride in upper stretch, was put to a left-handed whip at the furlong marker, switched to a right-handed whip
outside the sixteenth-pole, swapped back to her inside lead shortly thereafter and proved much the best while under a hand ride in the shadow of the wire.
CATCAKE bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along on the outside, angled in near the seven-sixteenths, went two then three wide on the turn, came
four wide into the stretch, moved into second around the three-sixteenths, had the rider lose his whip inside the furlong marker and earned the place while
no match for the winner. SOMEKINDAWICKED was ridden along near the back, raced inside to the two path on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and
lacked the needed response while along for the show. MOLLY GOLIGHTLY bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along in the second flight, went
around the turn in the two path and tired. LUCKY LINZ was bumped on both sides at the start then taken up, spotted the front many lengths, raced on the
outside at the rear under urging, rounded the turn in the three path, turned into the stretch under the whip, moved out around the three-sixteenths and failed
to threaten. GOODNIGHT GRACIE broke out and bumped with a rival, was well placed in the second flight while inside of foes, chased along the rail under
strong urging on the turn and came up empty. BLUE RIDGE LEGACY bobbled at the start then came out and bumped with a foe, was coaxed along on the
outside, dropped back while five wide on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
LAWTON stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, drew even with the leader while four wide into the stretch, took over inside the
quarter-pole, drifted in while kicking clear outside the furlong marker and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. STAR OF KODIAK leaned out
and brushed the gate at the start and was off a half-step slow, raced just off the pace under tight restraint, drafted inside on the turn, was asked with a clear
rail opening at the quarter-pole, angled out behind the winner inside the three-sixteenths and finished willingly while second best. OMEGA MOON broke a
half-step slow then was hustled, settled just off the pace on the outside, was coaxed along while four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch,
chased past the three-sixteenths, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. SIR TRUEBADOUR was hustled to the lead, set the pace
under some pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was roused outside the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch, lost the lead
shortly thereafter and gave way.

Footnotes
SPECIAL BLESSING went four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, took the lead in the three path early on the far turn then moved clear,
responded well when shaken up a bit in upper stretch and drew off under a mild hand ride while much the best. HYPER PIPER was restless in the gate,
broke in and bumped with a foe then checked sharply, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked while three wide early on the far
turn, moved to four wide late on that bend, turned into the stretch under the whip and safely secured the place while unable to threaten the winner.
GOODPROFIT was bumped soundly on both sides at the start then checked sharply, went around the first turn in the two path, lost action briefly while tight
against the rail early on the backstretch then moved out, settled at the rear, was urged along while moving from three to five wide on the far turn, turned into
the stretch under the whip and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. BELLA CAJUN was restless in the gate, bumped with rivals just after
the start then checked, went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, raced in the two path under urging on the far turn, was driven
into upper stretch and came up empty. SWIFTY CAT was bumped lightly in the hindquarters just after the start, set the pace on the inside, lost the lead
under urging early on the far turn and faded. CICADA'S SONG was restless in the gate, bumped soundly with foes on both sides then checked while
pinched back, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, dropped back under urging while moving from four to six wide on the far turn and
faltered. FUGITIVE LADY was the most restless of four uneasy horses in the gate, bumped soundly with foes on both sides at the start, raced in the three
path on the first turn, contested the pace on the outside, dropped back under urging while two then three wide on the far turn and stopped.

Footnotes
IRRITATOR broke out and a step slow, was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed well to get
up late. LEWYS VAPORIZER brushed with a foe at the start, was hustled to the lead, set the pace under pressure to his outside, moved clear leaving the
backstretch, raced inside on the turn, extended the advantage outside the quarter-pole, was asked after turning into the stretch, led under a drive into the
final sixteenth but was caught while able to hold the place. NIIGON'S GLORY dropped well behind under urging, went three wide on the turn, was driven
four wide into the stretch, drifted out under a left-handed whip around the three-sixteenths, switched to a right-handed whip at the furlong marker and
finished with good energy to just get the show. RIV broke out at the start, was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, advanced inside of the
winner into the final furlong, chased into the final sixteenth then flattened out and lost the show. B W P EXPRESS broke in and awkwardly, was taken up
behind horses early, settled under some urging, saved ground on the turn and failed to rally. SENOR BLAIR brushed with a rival at the start, was urged
along while well behind the top two, went two to three wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response.
SNAPPER BITE pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and stopped.

Footnotes
AURELIUS MAXIMUS, given mild coaxing at the break to move forward, attended the pace inside just off I WILL STAND, took a narrow lead without urging
at the three-eighths pole still racing along the rail, edged clear turning for home, was asked in upper stretch and drew away while kept to task late. CHESS
CHIEF bobbled just slightly at the break, dropped in behind the leading trio saving ground on the rail through the first turn before coming off the fence still
tracking behind the leaders up the backstretch, tucked in a bit entering the far turn while taking closer order, shifted three wide at the five-sixteenths
advancing inside a tiring rival to commence a bid, approached the winner in upper stretch but despite urging was no match while clearly second best. I WILL
STAND broke on top and prompted the pace between rivals into the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to press from outside the eventual winner as
the outside rival dropped back past the half, asked for more leaving the far turn but had no late kick and weakened. CORNSTARCH broke outwardly just a
bit, raced mid-division inside through the first turn before switching out several paths in the clear and outside entering the run up the backstretch, came back
in for the far turn, was asked for run outside the five-sixteenths in about the two path, shifted four wide leaving that bend and was hard ridden in upper
stretch but did not produce a bid. CHASE THE GHOST attended the pace three abreast early, began to lose ground past the half-mile marker, came out a
further path on the far turn, was five wide at the head of the lane and weakened. DOMIKATE caught two wide in the first turn, was last but one racing off the
fence up the backstretch, continued in the two to three path and was never a threat. JEFE was urged at the break but devoid of speed, asked again by the
half, eased through the lane once distanced then walked off.

ESPERANZA DIAMOND was hustled from the start, tracked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, made a bid in the four path into the
stretch, edged clear around the three-sixteenths and proved best under steady urging. GILDED APPLE brushed with a foe at the start, was urged along off
the pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn and improved position to get the place. STEAL THE STARS was ridden along off the pace, went three
wide on the turn and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. WIDDLE GIANT brushed with a foe at the start, set the clear pace, raced
inside on the turn, lost the lead under a drive outside the three-sixteenths and gave way. KICK N KISS bumped hard with a rival at the start, moved in
towards the rear, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. MS LOUISA bumped hard with an opponent at the start, chased the pace from
third, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and tired. HIP FLASK was ridden along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and failed to

Footnotes
B RASEN went to the front, set the clear pace on the inside, extended the advantage on the far turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, responded well when
put to a drive in upper stretch and proved much the best under steady urging. MISS YOU JO went around the first turn in the two path, tracked the pace
down the backstretch, chased in the two path on the far turn, was driven three wide into the stretch and secured the place while no match for the winner.
OHMYMY OHMYYES broke about two lengths slow, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while three then four wide on the
far turn and lacked the needed response. NO MORE FOR U was off about two lengths slow, settled on the inside, was urged along on the far turn, saved
ground into the stretch and tired. JACOBS FLYER went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while three wide on the far turn
