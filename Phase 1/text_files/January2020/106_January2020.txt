Footnotes
FINAL PROOF came out at the break, sped to the early lead, set a pressured pace along the rail, opened up turning for home, drifted out near the eighth
pole and lasted. ICY DUDE lacked speed, saved ground on the turn, angled out entering the stretch, worked between horses and finished full of run. TOP
HAT TREASON , three wide turn, chased the winner and weakened late. BABY BOY circled the turn, floated to the seven pat in upper stretch, brushed with
MINE TO HOLD in upper stretch and flattened out. LUDICROUS MODE , no factor, passed tired horses late. MINE TO HOLD circled the turn, drifted to the
six path in upper stretch brushing with BABY BOY and lacked a rally. MISSION COMPLETE , a forward factor in the two path between horses entering the
turn, gave way leaving the turn. GREAT QUEST , in close quarters leaving the starting gate, prompted the pace outside the winner and gave way.
BOURBON AGOGO hugged the inner rail, chased the pace for a half mile and faltered.

Footnotes
MONKEY'S MEDAL , bumped and pinched back at the break, regrouped and settled off the inside, came under pressure three wide around the turn, angled
out to about the seven path in upper stretch, leveled off under left handed rousing past the furlong grounds, took aim of the dueling leaders and kept on
grinding to get up. CAUSE HE'S WESTERN , bumped at the break, rated close up between rivals early, eased back nearing the turn, angled out to advance
between foes mid turn, continued progress nearing the furlong grounds, dove towards the rail and bid inside the leaders past the sixteenth marker, gained a
slim lead late but was nipped on the line. SIR BRAHMS , four deep early on, stalked outside rivals around the turn, shifted out about five to six wide in upper
stretch, bid leaving the sixteenth marker and kept trying. I IDOLIZE YOU , between foes early, gained a prompting spot into the turn, bid in hand outside
CALADAN mid turn, dueled on near even terms from upper stretch past the eighth pole then faded late. CALADAN came out at the break and made contact
with CAUSE HE'S WESTERN, rushed up towards the inside and grabbed command leaving the chute, set the pace just off the rail, was joined around the
turn, dueled from the head of the lane past the furlong grounds and faded late. CHARGING LION flashed speed, rated off CALADAN leaving the chute,
dropped in around the turn and gave way.

pace along the rail and weakened late. AWESOME AGENDA hugged the rail around the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and failed to close in an
even effort. ONE MORE TOM , four wide entering the stretch, raced between horses and lacked a rally. MCLEAN HOUSE saved ground on the turn and
failed to rally. LUCKY JUNIOR , unhurried down the backstretch, swung to the four path turning for home, then was taken farther out in mid stretch.

Footnotes
LIFE IN FLASH settled well back early on, angled in for the run around the turn, took closer order into the lane, stayed inside to continue progress under left
handed encouragement, gained command in deep stretch and prevailed. POSTINO'S SECRET lagged off the pace, gathered some momentum four wide
nearing the lane, shifted out wider past the three sixteenths, closed in under a drive, loomed past the sixteenth marker, had his rider lose the stick in deep
stretch and was denied. FRISKY WHISKEY stalked the leader while well clear of others nearing the turn, moved four to five wide to engage into lane,
spurted clear in upper stretch, wandered inward near the three sixteenths, drifted out and gave way grudgingly. RAVENEL rated off the pace, moved up
while saving ground into the lane, altered out as FRISKY WHISKEY came in near the three sixteenths, gave hard chase to the sixteenth marker, failed to
kick on from there, drifted and faded. DEAR CHARLOTTE saved ground early and was outrun. R TRUE SENSATION opened up early and set a strong
pace, drifted three to four wide when being collared into the stretch, stayed on a bit longer then retreated.

MY MAN POTS N PANS hugged the rail mid way on the turn, eased out approaching the stretch, swung to the five path in upper stretch, gained the lead
outside horses near the eighth pole and held sway under pressure. NOBLE WEED circled the turn three wide, gained a short lead outside GOING TO THE
LEAD in upper stretch, failed to hold off the winner but gamely held the place. GOING TO THE LEAD disputed the pace outside GALATIANS, disposed of
that one entering the stretch and finished gamely inside the top pair. GALATIANS bore out leaving the starting gate, disputed the pace along the rail and
faded through the stretch. ANTRIM AUBREY , steadied in traffic leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, raced between horses in the stretch and
lacked a rally. MOTI broke slowly and was outrun. BENANDJOE , steadied when pinched back leaving the starting gate, raced five deep into the stretch and
failed to menace. RISING PERRY stalked the pace two wide, eased out to the four path entering the stretch and gave way. EGO TRIP was outrun.

BLUE EYED GIRL took measure of the leader three wide, bid in hand, cruised clear past the five sixteenths, responded to strong handling in upper stretch,
eagerly pulled away and was kept to task. NIGHTLIFE stalked four wide, made a threatening run mid turn, gave willing pursuit leaving the three sixteenths,
wandered outward late and lasted for second. ELEVATED VISION , in tight early, moved up while saving some ground past the five eighths, eased out three
wide around the turn, shifted back in a bit in the drive and finished with good energy. MONEY FROMHEAVEN lacked speed, raced four wide into the lane,
made a mild run in mid stretch then flattened out. FIRTH , bumped at the break, moved up between rivals nearing the half mile marker, pursued around the
turn but came up empty. NTH DEGREE saved ground while in range, was stalled behind a tiring rival leaving the five sixteenths to upper stretch, angled out
and churned on. SALTWORKS , reluctant to load, dropped off the early pace, raced five wide into the stretch and failed to menace. GRACE ISABELLA ,
hustled along off the pace, raced six wide into the lane and was not a factor. MY STAR POTENTIAL was sent clear early, set the pace two wide, could not
resist the winner leaving the three eighths and faltered.

Footnotes
PITCHING ARI stalked the pace, hugged the inner rail around the turn, found room inside horses to challenge for the lead in upper stretch and drove clear.
COURT SKY circled the turn four deep, gained a short lead in upper stretch, shut off OCCHI D'ORO when drifting on near the three sixteenths pole and
flattened out. THE POSER chased the pace between horses, was in the five path in upper stretch and finished willingly between rivals. TAPPING THE
GLASS , behind a wall of horses leaving the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch, had a mild advance to the eighth pole and failed to sustain his
move. OCCHI D'ORO opened a clear lead mid way down the backstretch, was kept well off the rail, raced in the three path on the turn and was checked
when shut off by COURT SKY in upper stretch. LIAM'S FIRE , kept off the rail on the turn, raced in the two path entering the stretch and was caught in tight
quarters near the three sixteenths pole. ROCK THE COMET , far back after breaking very awkwardly, was hopelessly outrun. Following a stewards' inquiry
and an objection by the rider of OCCHI D'ORO, COURT SKY was disqualified and placed fifth.

Footnotes
PAID HOLIDAY vied outside EGREGIOUS before going clear into the turn, set the pace two wide, came a bit wider for the drive, turned away CARTHAGE
in mid stretch, kicked back clear and held sway under a drive. CARTHAGE , bumped at the start, chased outside a rival, raced three to four wide into the
lane, ranged up and threatened in mid stretch but wasn't quite good enough. STRAITOUTA CONGTIN saved ground, eased out in the drive and rallied
mildly to gain the show. LEADING MAN stalked the pace, raced four to five wide into the lane, moved a bit closer past the three sixteenths, drifted in briefly,
corrected and hung. LUV THE PAINTER , off the pace and removed from the rail, circled five to six wide and offered a late gain. EGREGIOUS came out at
the break and bumped with a rival, vied inside the winner early on, chased around the turn and faded. WISKY CHARLIE was outrun.
