Footnotes
TOURNESOL got pushed out by SUBTLE JOY and bumped with LET'S GO LUNA at the start, raced well back for six furlongs, tipped out for clearance in
mid stretch and closed with a rush to get up in time. MARIES MELODY bumped with BRATOUTTAHELL at the start, prompted the pace outside that rival,
took over after six furlongs and pulled clear into the stretch, remained clear inside the 70-yard marker but could not hold on. SUBTLE JOY broke out
pushing TOURNESOL into LET'S GO LUNA, edged closer to the front flight around the far turn three then four wide, rallied mildly through the lane but did
not have enough to seriously menace. WONDER BLONDY saved ground most of the way, put in a mild bid along the rail to get a minor share, and was
vanned off after the finish. GEA moved out four wide early, had the five-path turning for home, and was going well too late. DAZZLING BRIDE fought
restraint heading to the first turn inside, settled down through the middle stages, waited for room behind the leaders in the two-path at the top of the lane,
came clear in upper stretch to loom a threat, but flattened out late. ONETHINGORANOTHER saved ground on the turns near the back, and improved in the
two-path without threatening. ZANDREA'S broke slowly, and remained uninvolved in the proceedings. BRATOUTTAHELL bumped with MARIES MELODY
at the start, set the pace inside to the far turn, and faded steadily once displaced for command. OMI TEN shifted out four wide approaching the stretch, and
came up empty. LAW DEGREE lodged a mild three-wide bid near the quarter-pole, but gave way in the stretch. LET'S GO LUNA bumped with the eventual
winner at the start, went to the first turn four wide, stayed in range for six furlongs and had nothing left.

Footnotes
MY G P S saved ground while forwardly positioned around the first turn, settled nicely in hand and stalked the pace down the backstretch, remained
patiently handled along the inside then tipped out three to four wide leaving the far turn and put to a drive, wrested the advantage from CROI MOR in the
final furlong and kicked away. INDIRECTLY secured inside position around the first turn then settled nicely while rated near midpack down the backstretch,
waited for a clear path nearing the quarter pole then hustled up turning for home, shifted out wider near the furlong marker and produced a solid finish.
CROI MOR was forwardly positioned around the first turn and prompted the pace to the far turn, launched a bid for command near the quarter pole,
advanced to a brief lead at the furlong marker then got collared by the winner, stayed on with response and got nipped for place. MUHLENBERG was
unhurried and raced four wide through early stages, picked up the pace and gained position along the outside moving through the far turn, came out wide
into the drive, stayed along the far outside with steady response and gained a couple spots. LOVEDISC fanned five wide entering the first turn, settled
racing near mid-range through early stages, picked up the pace around the final turn, kept under steady pressure in stretch run and produced a mild bid.
HAPPY DANZA led the way in the first turn then set the pace with CROI MOR not far behind down the backstretch, remained the leader then took on the
challenge of CROI MOR leaving the final turn, fought back top of the lane then had no kick left in reserve and gave way. ROAN MOUNTAIN raced in the
back and saved ground down the backstretch, picked up the pace late far turn, tipped wider turning for home then came in and raced two wide at the furlong
marker and lacked the needed response for impact. STARSHIP YODA raced off the early pace and saved ground, hustled up for response along the rail in
the far turn but failed to kick on. LODI was keen and tugged under a strong hold in the first turn, continued a bit keyed up under slight restraint early
backstretch then began to settle more, given cue to go after the leaders around the far turn but had no kick left in reserve and weakened. SHANGASSAH
broke out at the start, raced two to three wide off the pace, moved into upper stretch three to four wide and offered no late rally. SOY BORRACHO broke out
and bumped the gate at the start, raced near the rear along the outside and failed to move into contention. KING OF THE CATS raced in range while settled
nicely down the backstretch then came up empty and retreated around the final turn.

Footnotes
LOVELY LADY LEXI saved ground in easy striking range early, waited for an opening behind the leaders approaching the quarter-pole, found a seam in the
three-path and challenged between QUEEN ABARRIO and MARKISTAN through the furlong grounds, bumped lightly with the latter outside the
sixteenth-pole and edged clear. MARKISTAN raced three then four wide on the turn, challenged for command in the four-path through mid stretch, bumped
lightly with LOVELY LADY LEXI a sixteenth out and kept on gamely to best the others. QUEEN ABARRIO pressed the pace three wide, reached a short
lead after a half-mile, battled between foes through upper stretch, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile. STAMINA PRINCESS raced four wide
beginning to advance a bit after a half, drifted out through the lane and improved for a minor share. AWESOME FLYER dashed clear early but was soon
pressured by BABY SABRINA and QUEEN ABARRIO, was hard-pressed to fend them off through the turn, fought on to mid stretch and gave way. UNCUT
had her head turned at the break and was off three lengths slow, raced four then five wide around the turn, and could not reach contention. I'LL DO IT MY
WAY settled in the middle of the field two wide for a half-mile, and could not gain. JUST LIKE INDY was outrun inside. HOLD THE SPENDING saved
ground to no avail. BABY SABRINA pressed the pace between horses, had the rider lose the whip just past the five-sixteenths, and gave way. LA GATA
NEGRA broke slowly, raced four wide on the turn, and remained outrun on the far outside. PAZYARMONIA was five wide at the top of the stretch, and had
nothing left.

Footnotes
LA INCONDICIONAL was off to a good start and raced up close three wide entering the first turn, continued in close contention and tracked the pair of
embattled leaders to the far turn, was confidently handled racing in three path at the quarter pole, hustled up turning for home and shifted out wider for the
drive, vied for the lead seven wide at the furlong marker then kicked in and drew clear. ZODIAC PRINCESS popped open the gate but did not get away,
broke in and steadied at the start then was rank and steadied along into the first turn, refused to settle and tugged into the backstretch, raced in traffic at
head of the lane, found a path two wide then moved to the inside and gained late to finish on equal terms with KARENINA. KARENINA vied for the lead with
EASTERN PRINCESS around the first turn then continued to race near equal terms down the backstretch, battled back around the final turn, kept on
gamely with added challengers in pursuit at the eighth pole, could not move on with the winner but kept on then drifted out deep stretch and finished on
equal terms for place. MAGIC RIVER bumped at the start then tracked the pace to the far turn, headed in pursuit and loomed up to race in aim at the furlong
marker but failed to sustain needed kick and evened out. NOBLE INTENTIONS was unhurried and saved ground down the backstretch, angled out and
picked up the pace entering the far turn, raced in traffic at head of the lane then finished between foes and had a mild improve. SWEEPENO rated near
midpack down the backstretch, was patiently handled racing between foes at the quarter pole, prompted and advanced to duel for the lead at the furlong
marker then flattened out. FOR KICKS raced five to six wide settled in range down the backstretch, roused for more near the three eighths pole, raced
evenly around the far turn, stayed along the outside with interest in final furlong then got carried wider deep stretch. MI KARLITA settled off the early pace,
swung wide into stretch run, hustled along the far outside then got carried out wider deep stretch. EASTERN PRINCESS dueled for the lead around the first
turn, continued to battle down the backstretch and around the final turn then came up empty with a furlong left to run. RUCIA MORA lagged behind, saved
ground and had no response.

Footnotes
BEAST OF WILDWOOD grabbed the early lead inside, edged away from IRISH THUNDER after six furlongs, and widened under a drive. MARIALUISA
saved ground throughout, and rallied along the rail for second without menacing the winner. IRISH THUNDER pressed the pace outside BEAST OF
WILDWOOD to the quarter-pole, and weakened through the lane. CAT'S J N J veered out sharply at the start impeding CALLMESENORITA and to a lesser
extent ST. LOUIE ARCH, chased after the leaders three wide, and gave way approaching the stretch. CALLMESENORITA was impeded as CAT'S J N J
took her path away at the break, and never factored. MISS CHEENY bobbled at the start and was slow to begin, and never got close. ST. LOUIE ARCH
was bothered at the start when CAT'S J N J came over, raced four wide and was through after a half-mile. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
MY POINT EXACTLY sped to the lead at the start, secured inside position and set the pace with SOUPER JAGUAR not far behind, held firm around the far
turn then stayed sharp in response under steady pressure and kept clear. SOUPER JAGUAR was forwardly positioned around the first turn, remained in
close contention and stalked the pacesetter down the backstretch, launched a bid for MY POINT EXACTLY racing in two path around the far turn, stayed on
with response in stretch run, could not reach the winner but produced a solid effort for second best. MOZO BELLO floated out wide entering the first turn,
switched in to race two wide settled off the pace in early stages, waited along the inside moving around the turn then shifted out three to four wide upper
stretch and gained share. OVER THE CHANNEL raced along the outside and settled off the early pace, hustled up for response entering the far turn, kept
under a drive five wide into the lane, briefly drifted in a path near the furlong marker then came out under left handed urging and continued a steady bid.
UNLOCKTHEPOTENTIAL was unhurried down the backstretch, angled out and hustled up around the far turn, shifted out widest at head of the lane and
improved. RHYTHMIA was off a step slow at the start, remained settled off the early pace to the far turn, swung six to seven wide entering top stretch and
improved position without threatening. LUCKY MIKE was unhurried and saved ground to the far turn, hustled up along the rail into stretch and failed to kick
on. FREEDOM MATTERS raced in tracking mode positioned off the top two leaders down the backstretch, commenced a steady three wide bid around the
far turn then weakened in the lane. GREAT KAHUNA was ridden along racing mid-pack through early stages, rouse for more but failed to advance around
the final turn then gave way. GRAY DUDE raced in range while settled along the inside, launched a bid at three eighths pole, hustled along the inside
around the far turn then faded in stretch run. TOTONO raced five wide into the first turn then settled off the early speed and had no response when called
upon around the far turn. GAME BOY BENNY lagged behind the field and failed to make a bid.

LOOKING FOR MORE split horses beginning to get rolling midway on the turn, rallied three wide to collar BULLDAT from outside at the top of the lane,
forged to the front under a drive through upper stretch, and was merely shown the whip the rest of the way home. UPSY DAISY DO was never far back
while saving ground, stayed inside for the drive and was along for the place. BULLDAT sprinted clear after the start, showed the way slightly off the inside to
the top of the lane, proved no match for the winner outside the eighth-pole and yielded the place in the late stages. GRACIE'S DREAM hugged the rail
outrun to the lane, and offered a mild response to get up for a minor share. WILD ABOUT THIS chased outside BULLDAT for a half-mile, and faded
steadily. AURORA NATION tired after a half three wide. JEANIE VEE showed little trailing throughout.

Footnotes
DR. SHANE led the way after the start then conceded position to THUNDER RIDE in the first turn, stalked the leader down the backstretch and edged up
closer late far turn, given cue at head of the lane, roused forward to race in aim for the lead at the furlong marker, dug in determinedly and took a slim
advantage and held gamely. CLASS AND CASH was away in good order and raced in a forward position around the first turn, stalked under slight restraint
down the backstretch, remained in close contention while patiently handled near the inside around the final turn, put to a drive at head of the lane, slipped
through along the rail to challenge for the lead, kept on gamely along the rail under strong right handed pressure and got edged for the win. BALLAGH
ROCKS raced in contention and tracked the top trio down the backstretch, advanced a bit closer and raced in three path going by the quarter pole, was set
down for the drive and roused forward four deep to race in aim for the lead a furlong out, continued a steady bid in striking distance but lacked the needed
kick to get by. THUNDER RIDE took over the lead going around the first turn, set the pace down the backstretch and remained the leader around the far
turn, fought back when challenged upper stretch, vied for the top spot with a furlong left to run then had no late kick left in reserve. GOLDEN DRAGON
raced near midpack and saved ground to the far turn, switched out and edged up closer near the quarter pole, was given cue in two path upper stretch then
shifted out wider and kept on with interest. GUNNISON saved ground and settled off the early speed, was patiently handled while saving ground around the
far turn, was put to a drive along inside to two wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick for late impact. MOON COLONY raced near midpack then
hustled up four wide late far turn, moved into upper stretch six wide and lacked a needed rally. MONARCHS GLEN (GB) was unhurried out of the gate and
saved ground around the first turn, was reserved racing in the back off the inside, hustled up for response then swung wide into the drive and failed to move
on. FOREVER MO was off slow at the start then rated five to six wide off the pace under slight restraint, let out and hustled up for response around the far
turn and into upper stretch but lacked the needed response for impact. COWBOY'S HERO raced two to three wide near the rear to the far turn, moved into
top of the lane four wide then switched in a couple paths and offered no late rally. SOMELIKEITHOTBROWN rated four to five wide down the backstretch,
launched a brief bid then gave way.

Footnotes
FLAT AWESOME JENNY raced three wide in the second flight to the stretch, rallied in the four-path and overhauled the leaders from outside to pull clear
late. SHES ALL WOMAN was close-up behind the leaders for a half-mile, waited for an opening toward the inside approaching the stretch, moved out into
the lane and lodged a bid between horses, and finished willingly to be second best. MOONSTONE set a pressured pace near the inside, edged clear
through the furlong grounds, but could not hold off the top two while able to salvage the show. SKY CHASER pressed the pace outside MOONSTONE to
the stretch, and weakened. SLINGIN SAMMY B went along covered up behind horses in the two-path to the stretch, and lacked the needed response.
DERBY DAY ZIP was outrun throughout. SHE'S PRIMO was reserved early, raced three then four wide around the turn, and faded steadily on the far
outside. SELECT FRIDAY broke slowly, raced four wide and tired after a half.

DEVOTED KITTEN raced three to four wide entering the first turn then settled near mid-range down the backstretch, hustled up racing between foes at the
quarter pole, kept under a ride three wide entering the lane, gathered momentum under right handed pressure and kicked clear in final furlong. DING DONG
DITCH tracked the top two leaders to the far turn, moved up to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, shook away and held clear at the furlong marker
