Footnotes
GLADTOBEHERE chased leader to the half, rallied inside under vigorous urging to prevail on the wire. PRINCE ARLO rated kindly to far turn, dueled into
stretch but was outfinished in the final seventy yards. RISKY TOWN perfect position throughout and finished well outside for show. STRONG YEN sprinted
clear, tried to them wire to wire but could not go on late. TESTY KITTEN never a menace with mild improvement. MANSOOR always a non factor.
RANSACK failed to menace. JUSTENUFFTUFF stopped badly at the half, folded.

MERCHANTS OF COOL tracked the pace early, made a bid three wide near the five sixteenths pole, took over command into the lane and drew off down
the lane while much the best. HARD TARGET tracked the pace early, led briefly near the five sixteenths pole, was off the rail into the lane and no match for
the winner in the stretch run. AUTOPILOT stalked the pace early, shifted into the three path in the turn and moved up in the stretch drive. SHAKA was slow
into stride at the start, raced along the four path into the lane and improved position in the stretch. CIBOLIAN was back early on, shifted into the three path
in the turn and improved position down the lane. MR SUPERB came out at the start, chased the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and faded late.
DESTINED FOR HONOR was bumped and bothered at the start and through after a half. EL FRANCO was done early. FAME IS ROUGH came out at the
start and was no factor. UNDERSTAND bled and was vanned off after the race. TIZ DEJA BLUE had early speed then stopped.
