in hand. RATLTRAP chased the pace well off the rail and raced five wide on the turn, took second inside the sixteenth pole and was gaining through later
yards. ENDLESS PARADIGM gave chase off the rail then angled four wide leaving the turn and finished evenly. EIGHT OF DIAMONDS contested the pace
and raced at a close disadvantage two deep through the turn, but, flattened stride the final furlong. GOTTO GETITMAN gave chase and rounded the turn
about the three path then proved empty down the lane. OLBIN HOUSE hesitated at the break and was not a factor.

raced clear under the wire. LIL LINDER pressured the early pace then took over at the three eighths pole, drew clear midway on the turn, dug in to steady
encouragement through the lane but was caught flattening stride later yards. SILK STOCKING gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the five path of
the turn then finished evenly to take third later yards. RED BEAN SONDE was hustled along to set a pressured pace the opening three sixteenths of a mile
then gave chase from the three eighths pole, dropped back mid turn then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. TAKE PATTERNS chased the pace and
rounded the turn about the six path then finished evenly. BOLD LITTLE BABY gave chase and came through the turn in the four path before weakening.

Footnotes
MR SMURTHWAITE settled off the pace in the two and three paths then bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, took the lead two deep approaching the head
of the lane and dug in under steady encouragement to inch clear. NAUTICAL NATURE rated the pace inside, was pressured toward the five sixteenths pole,
gave up the nod approaching the head of the lane but dug in gamely before ceding; reluctantly. NEW AFLEET raced off the pace, bid leaving the three
eighths pole, eased outward in the upper stretch, finished well and was gaining on the runner-up. ANOTHER VICTORY settled off the pace then steadied at
the inside flank of Quickhatch past the three eighths pole, slipped by that one at the rail nearing the head of the lane but showed little more. BLIMEY LIMEY
raced well off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, though, showed little more. MARCH TO MY TUNE saved
ground. QUICKHATCH stalked the pace from the two and three paths then picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, but, faded past the five
sixteenths. Because of an equipment malfunction, the half mile fraction was hand timed.

GOIN GANGSTA angled in to stalk the early pace two deep, took aim leaving the three eighths pole, dueled to the front past the quarter, raced clear
approaching the head of the lane then steadily handled through the lane. CORKY COWGIRL angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure
leaving the three eighths pole, gave up the lead and chased the winner past the quarter, but, relented through the lane. STARBOARD saved ground well off
the early pace then eased out entering the backstretch, started a bid from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn five wide and was along for third
late. WORKPANSOMETHINGS raced off the early pace in the three and four paths then bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn just off
the rail and showed little more. MO CUISHLE saved ground the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced in
the four path of the far turn and showed little more. MY COUSIN VICKY showed little response through the backstretch. MOM'S MAGIC steadied at the rail
off the heels of Corky Cowgirl into the first turn, gave chase from that point but faded through the far turn. GINGERBREAD LADY raced well back. Due to an
equipment malfunction, the half mile fraction was hand timed.

Footnotes
ROCKET ROAD loaded reluctantly then settled just off the pace in the four and five paths, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, closed well to
take aim in the three path approaching the top of the lane, took the lead mid-stretch then drew away later yards. MAJOR MEDALLIST was firmly rated to set
the pace inside, came under pressure past the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, was caught mid-stretch and gave way later yards.
LETCHER saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then dueled through the stretch for third.
ELLO GOVNA stalked the pace in the three path the opening turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and was outfinished for
third the final sixteenth. SALT MINE settled off the pace then eased out into the backstretch, bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced five wide on the
far turn and passed some faders. TECHNICALLYSPEAKIN saved ground off the pace, raced at the rail on the far turn and improved with minimal effort.
FIRE TIGAR settled off the pace about the three path the opening turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn
then weakened. EMBLEM'S ESTATE showed little response through the backstretch and rounded the far turn in the five path. RAMBAM ROCKER stalked
the early pace in the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then faded through the far turn. SET'EM UP JOE saved ground the first turn and
was through after a half mile.
