Footnotes
PRETTY PENNY settled within striking distance four wide while in the seven path down the backstretch, went up to challenge the lead three wide entering
the far turn, matched strides with the runner up the balance of the trip and got up in the final strides. DIAMOND DARLIN vied for the lead four wide for a half,
assumed command two wide on the far turn, set the balance of the pace under strong pressure from the winner,, the rider lost his whip just before the wire
and was caught in the final stride. EVEN IF trailed for a half, swung wide entering the stretch and passed tiring rivals in the seven path. EOWYN'S
PARADISE allowed to settle, improved in the four path entering the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. LITTLE MCNASTY set the early pace, had speed
into the far turn then was used up. ORIENTAL TALE vied for the lead two wide and was through after a half. DREAM ON GORGEOUS pressed the pace
two wide for three furlongs, made the lead, set the pace into the far turn, stopped abruptly, was eased the length of the stretch, walked to the wire then was
walked off.

Footnotes
KITTY EXPRESS always within striking distance near the inside, closed rapidly in the three path on the far turn, made the lead at the top of the stretch and
finished full of run under strong handling to win as much the best. THREE BIRDS allowed to settle, rallied steadily along the inside through the stretch and
finished second best. BEAUTIFUL CREATURE chased the pace three wide around the clubhouse turn, made the lead before a half, shook clear soon
thereafter, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was outfinished. SPECIAL CONQUEST trailed for five furlongs then closed late three wide into the five
path. ROSE OF PRADO failed to menace. DIAMOND BREW was hung four wide into the clubhouse turn, was forwardly placed outside then lacked the
needed response. KATIE'S SUNRISE was no threat. MUSKOKA SUZIE broke in front, set the early pace along the inside, had speed for six furlongs then
folded. TSAR CANNON pressed the pace from between rivals two wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
CLASSIC MO stalked the early pace, rallied three wide to make the lead on the turn then widened the balance of the trip under brisk handling to win as
much the best. LIME AND TEQUILA was unprepared for the start, trailed early then closed with a burst of speed through the stretch five wide and finished
clear for second. JOHNNY UTAH unhurried early, finished with good courage along the rail. CONEY ISLAND KID went evenly. CIELO LINDO pressed the
pace from the inside and weakened in the final furlong. BOSSY AND MOBIL failed to menace. BLINGITONAGAIN away alertly, set the pace two wide into
the turn, drifted out to the seven path entering the stretch and gave way. ROCKETMON was outrun. OBSESSIONSOPTIMIST was through early.

Footnotes
VALID INTEREST settled just off the leaders in the three path, split horses three wide on the turn, swung out to near mid track entering the stretch, made
the lead near the furlong marker and won going away. PEGGY'S COVE allowed to settle, rallied four wide on the turn to make the lead before a half, set the
pace into the stretch, drifted late under left handed urging and was no match for the winner. UNBELIZABLE pressed the early pace along the inside,
dropped back on the turn, shifted out three wide then came on again late. MARIE'S MANDATE pressed the pace three then two wide until mid stretch then
was outfinished. MEAN ERIKA raced a wide trip and faded. TRAPPED TOWN failed to menace. TO HONOR AND RUN sprinted to the lead two wide soon
after the start, set a pressured pace for nearly a half, remained a sharp threat until deep stretch along the inside then weakened. EASTERN PRIDE was no
threat. FIRST SQUADRON had speed into the turn then weakened. SCHLEPROCK TOWN was no factor. READY TO TAP was outrun.

Footnotes
SISTER'S CREED broke in full stride to set all the pace and widened through the stretch to win as much the best while in hand late. DARLING DAAHER
never far back, moved up five wide on the turn and finished clear for second. RARE GIFT had a mild late rally eight wide. GUN THING settled mid pack and
finished with good courage three wide. GOLDEN PEARL chased the winner from the inside and faded in the final furlong. LEGITIMACY with the second
flight into the stretch, failed to respond. BETTER VIBES passed tiring rivals. EAST AND UNION failed to menace. WHAT'S THE LINE stalked the pace into
the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. LIGHTNING MISS showed little. PABLO CREEK broke a step slow and failed to reach contention. STREET
VOLUME was outrun.
