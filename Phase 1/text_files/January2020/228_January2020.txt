Footnotes
COLEAQUILUS rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn then
dug in under steady encouragement to just last. GIO LEMON stalked the pace three wide then bid nearing the three eighths pole, contested at a close
disadvantage in the three path of the far turn, drifted a bit leaving the turn but dug in through the lane and just missed. EL EMANUEL saved ground off the
early pace then eased out into the backstretch, started an outside bid from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn six wide and finished evenly.
HIGH SOCIETY settled off the pace in the two and three paths then bid nearing the quarter pole, angled to the five path approaching the head of the lane
and finished evenly to pass some rivals. PLAYFUL SUNRISE stalked the pace off the rail, bid from the three eighths pole, raced two deep on the far turn but
showed little in the lane. HOORAY HENRY stalked the pace from the three and four paths then challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and remained
a close factor to the middle of the far turn before fading. HOWELL MOUNTAIN raced off the pace then saved ground into the second turn, bid nearing the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then weakened. DEPUTY DREW raced mostly well off the pace.

Footnotes
GABBI'S AMOR engaged in close chase through the backstretch, raced three wide on the turn then dug in from the top of the stretch to get up the final
yards. GOOD GENES lacked room inside most of the backstretch then checked off the tail of Too Many Coronas past the five sixteenths pole, angled six
wide with a bid into the stretch and finished well to take second the final strides. SYNERGY UNBRIDLED chased the pace toward the outside and drew
close four wide on the turn, drifted a bit leaving the turn and was nipped from second the final strides. TOO MANY CORONAS gave chase inside and dug in
at the rail through the turn to take a slim lead inside the eighth pole, but was outfinished through later yards. REALLY BOPPIN angled to the inside to set the
pace, came under pressure into the turn, gave up the nod just inside the eighth pole and was outfinished in the stretch drive. CAT COME HOME gave chase
through the backstretch and rounded the turn in the four path, was carried seven wide leaving the turn and finished evenly. TRANSFIGURED hopped at the
break and raced well back while saving ground, bid past the three eighths pole, rounded the turn at the rail and showed little more. TWINSANITY gave
chase through the backstretch then faded on the turn. CANARSIE KID chased the early pace outside and raced two deep on the turn but proved empty
through the lane.

later yards. DONTMESAWITHSISTER raced off the pace in the three path the first turn then eased out entering the backstretch, bid leaving the three
eighths pole to take a slim brief lead while two deep midway on the far turn, but was quickly overcome and had to settle for second best. LUV THE
PAINTER settled back while saving ground then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn four wide and finished evenly. BALLYHOO

UPPERVILLE saved ground off the pace then bid leaving the three eighths pole, improved his position through the far turn, slipped through to take the lead
at the rail just inside the eighth pole and dug in determinedly to inch ahead of OFFSHORE TRIP, who rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure toward
the three eighths pole and contested the edge just off the rail rounding the far turn, ceded the advantage leaving the eighth pole but dug in gamely through
the lane before giving way; grudgingly. CASHTON PEAK raced well back from early contention then bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
in the five path then dueled for third the final sixteenth. BURNIN RING O FIRE saved ground off the pace the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, angled four wide into the stretch and was outfinished for third the final sixteenth. STRAPHANGER stalked the pace two
deep then challenged nearing the three eighths pole, dueled close three wide on the far turn but dropped back at the eighth pole and flattened stride inside
the sixteenth. MARCH TO MY TUNE raced well back and could only improve his position. FIRST TALENT stalked the pace from the three path, bid leaving
the three eighths pole then faded while losing ground on the far turn. AJWIBAH raced outside into the backstretch and showed little response. TOWNIE
raced in the five path the first turn then stalked the pace four wide into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole but faded through the far
turn. DYNASIR was distanced after the opening quarter mile and loped to the wire.

nearing the quarter pole, drifted to the five path on the turn and was along to recover third. ELAINE raced with the pace but dropped back while drifting to
the five path approaching the top of the stretch and flattened out the final sixteenth. MOJO MATTERS gave chase and raced off the rail on the turn then

RIP THORN took the lead two deep approaching the nine sixteenths pole and rated the pace, was urged away from the five sixteenths then steadily handled
to hold on well. RUM RUNNER RED raced well back from early contention in the four and five paths, started an outside bid nearing the three eighths pole,
progressed four wide through the far turn then dueled for second the final sixteenth. GHOST MINE stalked the pace inside from the nine sixteenths pole
then bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then outfinished for second the final sixteenth. THORN OF ROSE HILL rounded the
opening turn in the five path then stalked four wide into the backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then raced in the three path
the far turn and flattened stride inside the eighth pole. LIL SILVER FOX stalked the pace three wide leaving the first turn, gave chase toward the three
eighths pole but weakened at the rail rounding the far turn. SUAVE JUAN showed little response through the backstretch. FAST RIDE saved ground the first
turn and also showed little response through the backstretch. STERLING GLADIATOR saved ground.
