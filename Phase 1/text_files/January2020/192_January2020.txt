CLARENCE HEADS gained a favorable striking position after the break from the inside, tracked the leaders under patient handling to the stretch, eased out
for room at the three sixteenths and responded to gain command in mid stretch and drew clear. ST JAMES PLACE stalked the pace two wide early, offered
his best bid three wide on the second turn to gain a short lead in the stretch but could not hold the winner. LUCK IS MY NAME raced unhurried early from
off the rail, tried to rally three wide on the second turn but lacked the needed responsse. GALAXY MASTER settled early three wide, moved four wide on the
second turn but did not rally. DAVE'S GIFT lagged early from the inside then had no response. BATTALION WON pressed the pace two wide and came up

closed steadily. EASY GAME tracked the winner three wide, offered a menacing bid once in the lane but hung late. JOE JACKSON was unhurried early,
came two wide to the stretch and finished with some speed. POTENTE ALBA settled from just off the rail then failed to respond in a dull effort. ADMIRAL

SMILEFORME was quick from the gate to take a clear lead in the opening strides, extended his advantage into the upper stretch but was all out to hold.
LITTLE CENTS was not asked for speed early, came through inside to the stretch, shifted out and closed willingly. FOREIGN PROTOCOL was unhurried
early, rallied two wide into the stretch but lost some of his punch late. PRINCE DE PRINCE stalked three wide in an even effort. CAJUN BETTOR lacked

RED'S SHOWTIME dueled outside a three horse spread, forged to the front near the quarter pole, drew clear and impressively held his advantage. EL
CENTENARIO settled early, came three wide to the stretch, drifted in nearing the furlong pole and gained second. COLLUSION DELUSION lagged early,
was fanned four wide on the turn and rallied willingly. JUST LIKE FRED dueled between horses into the stretch and weakened. RUNKERRY settled early,
saved ground on the turn, eased out in the lane then was forced to steady sharply off EL CENTENARIO near the furlong pole. UNUSUAL MISCHIEF
showed little. ARKY VAUGHAN flashed early speed and stopped. Following a stewards inquiry, EL CENTENARIO was disqualified and placed fifth for
interference in the stretch.

MIDNIGHT FLOWER prompted the pace from the three path, forged to the lead on the second turn, was clear briefly but held willingly. IMPERIAL CREED
lagged early from the rail, remained inside on the second turn, came off the rail and closed a gap. ROSE PRINCESS stalked the pace two and three wide in
an even effort. SHARI saved ground to no avail. BABE DIDRIKSON was unhurried early three wide, was fanned five wide on the second turn and did not
rally. FAIRY TALE BLISS had no response while three wide much of the way. CASINO GAMES failed to rally from the two path into the stretch. OUR BOLD
PRINCESS was forced four wide on the second turn and did not rally. A LONNA AT THE TOP set the pace for six furlongs and stopped.

Footnotes
THE STIFF was unhurried early from off the rail, rallied steadily three wide into the lane and got up from the extreme outside. WINE AND WHISKY was
never too far back, came off the rail on the second turn and rallied steadi inside the winner but was outfinished. MYSTERIOUS STONES tracked the pace
three then two wide, led in the upper streetch, but could not hold the top two late. AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM tracked the pace from the outside throughout,
had his best bid in the upper stretch but lost his punch. FINAL FINAL lagged to the second turn, was fanned five wide into the lane and had only a mild rally.
LITTLE JOHN showed little. DESERT DUDE set the pace from off the rail for six furlongs and came up empty. MR. VITAMIN saved ground to no avail.

BOTTLE OF SMOKE was never far back, rallied three wide into the stretch to gain command but was outfinished. GREGS CITY ZIP set the pace from off
rail, gave way inside in the stretch but kept to his task. SPIDER RICO stalked from the rail to the stretch but did not rally. ROWDYROOSTER settled early,
came four wide to the stretch but failed to rally. SUCCESSFUL COMMAND stalked two wide and came up empty. NORTH FORK showed little. ABOVE
THE RAINBOW saved ground to no avail. TOP DOLLAR was never a factor.
