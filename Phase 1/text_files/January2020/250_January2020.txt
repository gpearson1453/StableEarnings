Footnotes
SAMARONTI went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace in the two path, responded well when set down in upper stretch and proved best under
strong urging. ZACHRY raced in the three path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the far turn, pursued the winner
under a drive in the stretch and was second best. WHATA PERFECT DAY broke out at the start, went three then two wide on the first turn, was reserved
towards the rear, came under urging in the two path on the far turn, dropped to the rail turning into the stretch and lacked the needed response while just up
for the show. BALLYHACK went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was asked while inside on the far turn, chased into upper stretch
and came up empty. DERBY DATE leaned out at the start then stumbled and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, went four wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, went five wide on the far turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. EKATI'S
VERVE broke a step slow, raced inside for most of the first turn then moved to the two path, settled near the back, was urged along while three wide on the
far turn and failed to threaten. OXBURGER went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked while four wide on the far turn, turned five wide
into the stretch and had nothing left.

Footnotes
LOVE CONQUERS quickly moved clear to dictate terms racing on or just off the rail, faced moderate pressure from an outside rival past the half-mile
marker, was allowed a bit more rein and turned back that foe, widened through the far turn into upper stretch and held safe. MY FIRST GUITAR settled well
back early racing just off the inside in the two to three path, continued unhurriedly up the backstretch, was given some encouragement on the far turn going
in the two then three path on that bend, swung widest of all to be eight deep at the quarter pole with much to do, was gaining late to just get up for second
over LOUISIANA MOON, who tucked in to the three path heading to the first turn settling into the stride nicely, came in a further path on that bend moving
up to race mid-pack inside a rival up the backstretch but off the fence, continued inside that foe from the three then four path on the far turn coming into
upper stretch six wide, shifted in a path then back out a bit for room in upper stretch, gained some but lost the place late. MUCH CLASS bumped the outside
rival at the break, raced mid-pack outside a foe three wide through the first turn, continued between foes three wide on the far turn coming out four to five
wide for the stretch run, ran on willingly but ultimately needed more. SAND PIT ROAD taken in hand briefly into the first turn as a rival came in, tracked off
the leaders from inside, continued to save ground through the far turn then moved out four wide about the three-sixteenths, ran on evenly thereafter. STUCK
IN VEGAS was a bit hard to handle while being guided in to the three then two path entering the first turn racing just off the leaders, continued to track in
behind just off the inside, also appeared to be getting out just a bit from the two path on the far turn, was thereupon guided out a path or two leaving that
bend with aim but could not kick on and evened out. STAR BANJO broke a half-step slowly, settled at the rear just off the fence in about the two path early,
continued two to three deep on the far turn, passed tired rivals in the stretch. NEON SKY appeared to be getting out a bit into the first turn going four then
five wide on that bend, raced off the leaders from outside still wide up the backstretch, continued five wide on the far turn spinning six deep into upper
stretch then weakened. KID CREOLE was within range having shifted in to the two to three path early, stalked the leader up the backstretch before applying
further pressure past the half-mile marker, faltered in the stretch and faded late. RICHIE GARY was bumped hard and steadied at the start, moved up
outside a couple rivals three to four wide early, continued three wide on the far turn and was never near enough to threaten. PANCHO'S LUCKY BOY was
coaxed from the break then caught five wide and taken back a bit shifting in a path early on that first turn, continued mid-division outside a foe up the
backstretch going five wide on the second turn but fanning seven deep out of that bend and failed to produce a bid. MY PROPHET was forwardly-placed
three to four wide in the early going stalking from outside, was still in range up the backstretch outside rivals, continued four wide on the far turn coming out
a further path for the drive, faltered and faded thereafter.

Footnotes
WIDDLE GIANT tracked the pace on the outside then in the two to three path on the turn, was given her cue near the three-eighths, chased into the stretch,
made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths then quickly took the lead, shook clear into the final furlong and held under strong urging. STARS FOREVER
broke out at the start, was hard held while tugging at the bit on the outside, dropped in some near the half-mile pole, came back out into the turn, was let out
while four then five wide on that bend, gained near the quarter-pole, chased outside in the stretch and finished with good courage to get the place. GILDED
APPLE settled off the pace, moved in near the half-mile pole, rounded the turn in the two path, steadied while hesitant to go through a gap between horses
at the five-sixteenths, was roused into upper stretch and finished with good energy but was too late while clear for the show. MS LOUISA moved up under
urging to take the lead, went clear near the half-mile pole, raced inside on the turn, was asked late on that bend, lost the advantage in upper stretch and
gave way. HANGING LAKE dropped back while urged along, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch under the whip and failed
to threaten. POPS SHANGHAI broke out at the start, settled on the outside, was urged along while three to four wide on the far turn, came out in upper
stretch and capitulated. SUPER SALAD broke out at the start then was hustled, raced with her head high while green on the outside, was urged along in the
five path on the turn and was no factor. BOSTON HONEY bobbled slightly just after the start, showed speed on the inside then was taken back near the
half-mile pole, dropped back at the seven-sixteenths, chased inside on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED CLASS broke on top and quickly moved clear shifting in to dictate terms from the inside, saved ground on the turn, extended the advantage
into upper stretch under some urging and was kept to the task late. PLAY ON exchanged light contact a couple times at the break, pursued the leaders from
outside foes going three wide on the turn, came out a further path turning for home, lugged in and out just a bit in upper- to mid-stretch, secured the place
while no threat to the winner. CHANGE OF CONTROL chased from between rivals two to three wide into the turn, lost some ground on inside and outside
foes leaving that bend, shifted out five wide into upper stretch outside those rivals and gained show honors. EYEINTHESKY brushed the outside rival at the
start, raced inside in the back half of the field, began to advance inside but just off the fence on the turn coming out four wide leaving that bend, ran on with
some late interest. CLASSY ACT pursued the leaders along the inside through the turn coming out a path or two leaving that bend, was still within striking
distance in upper stretch but weakened late. MAY LILY was bumped lightly at the break, raced between rivals at the back into the turn, came out to the
three path past the five-sixteenths coming into upper stretch four wide past the quarter pole, failed to rally. POSTER GIRL (GB) came in at the break and
exchanged a few bumps with rivals, raced between foes into the turn going three to four wide on that bend, came out five wide into the stretch and failed to
rally. HOTSHOT ANNA broke rather awkwardly then checked early when in tight behind rivals shortly after the start, shifted in and began to advance inside
on the turn but had to steady on heels past the five-sixteenths, came into the stretch just off the fence and shifted out gradually through the lane still in
behind foes but was left with too much to do. DOMONETTE chased the winner from off the inside going two wide on the turn, came up empty in the stretch.
ON PROBATION was bumped between foes at the start, raced outside rivals four then five wide on the turn coming widest to be seven abreast at the
quarter pole, failed to make a bid. QUICK QUICK QUICK broke a half-step slowly, coaxed forward outside rivals, chased three to four wide on the turn,
came into the stretch six wide past the quarter pole and faded in the lane.

CYRIL'S BOY settled into a comfortable stride while well placed in third position, went around the turn in the two path, rallied five wide into the stretch, took
the lead at the three-sixteenths, came in under a right-handed whip while fighting with COLD SMOKE at the furlong marker then was corrected by the rider,
kicked clear approaching the sixteenth-pole and proved best under steady urging. COLD SMOKE moved up on the outside then tracked the pace, made a
bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path on the turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive at the three-sixteenths,
battled inside of the winner into the final furlong and was outfinished while clear for the place. GAMBLER was hustled to the lead, set the clear pace, was
challenged while inside on the turn, lost the lead just after being asked at the quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and weakened
but was clear for the show. SCHEMER was bumped at the start and forced out then taken up briefly, spotted the front a couple of lengths, was urged along
on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn and failed to rally. JOHNNY CASINO was bumped at the start then forced into another foe, settled
towards the rear under some urging, rounded the turn in the two path, bumped with BOOGIE SHUES outside the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch
under a drive and failed to threaten. MOVE IT broke out and bumped with a rival then was sent hard before settling into stride, dropped back significantly
midway down the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn and failed to respond. BOOGIE SHUES dropped back while urged along, saved ground
on the turn, bumped with JOHNNY CASINO outside the five-sixteenths then checked, saved ground into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
BOYFRIEND MATERIAL was lightly rated in the early going pressing outside the pacesetter, let that one get a little great advantage leaving the turn having
going two wide on that bend and coming out a bit into upper stretch, was asked for run outside the three-sixteenths, started to gain ground past the furlong
marker, was bumped past the sixteenth pole and edged past late under stout left-handed urging. EARLY MISCHIEF set the pace inside pressed by the
aforementioned, was just clear turning into the stretch, drifted out in upper stretch then again under left-handed whip in late stretch to bump that rival and
was overtaken in the final strides. TWELFTH LABOUR switched outside a rival up the backstretch to race outside in the clear going three wide into the turn,
edged closer leaving that bend coming four wide to the quarter pole and out a further path in upper stretch, kept on willingly but was no match for the top
two. EXAMINER shifted in early racing in the two path into the turn, dropped back on the turn and was never near enough to threaten. EBBEN settled
inside, took slightly closer order leaving the turn while shifting three wide past the five sixteenths but could not sustain that effort and flattened out in the
drive.

drew off into upper stretch, widened under a hand ride into the final furlong, was put to the whip shortly thereafter then continued to widen under steady
urging. SWINGING GALAXY was bumped at the start then taken up, raced towards the rear under urging, went three then four wide on the turn, came six
wide into the stretch and got up for the place while far behind the winner. SOUTHERN LIGHT was ridden along off the pace, saved ground on the turn,
turned into upper stretch under a drive and missed the place while clear for the show. PURE VALOR was hustled from the start, contested the pace on the
inside, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths, was guided out while well behind the winner in upper stretch and tired.
CLASSICAL DUBAI was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, drifted out inside the three-sixteenths then back in nearing the furlong
marker and failed to respond. MYTHIC'S PATRIOT broke a half-step slow, was urged along off the pace, went three then two wide on the turn, turned into
the stretch under the whip and failed to respond. BIG COUNT broke a half-step slow, was urged along near the back, went three wide early on the turn,
moved to five wide near the five-sixteenths and never reached contention. NOCOMET broke out then bumped with a rival and was off a step slow, tossed
his head at the rear midway down the backstretch, went four wide early on the turn, dropped to three then two wide late on that bend and was no factor.

JOE G'S PAYBACK showed good speed and set the pace, vied inside on the turn, was asked in the two path into the stretch, shook off GOODNIGHT
GRACIE inside the three-sixteenths, responded well in the final furlong and held under strong urging. CATCAKE broke in a bit, established a good position
just off the pace, was guided around the turn along the rail, came under urging nearing the five-sixteenths, hesitated outside the quarter-pole then cut the
corner into the stretch, moved out under a drive at the three-sixteenths, pursued the winner determinedly in the final furlong, gained on that foe in the final
sixteenth but missed while clear for the place. GOODNIGHT GRACIE broke a half-step slow, settled just off the pace on the outside, was asked while three
wide on the turn, made a brief bid on the outside in upper stretch, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the
show. ROMAN JEWELS broke a half-step slow, moved up to stalk the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the turn, chased into upper
stretch, moved out while dropping back inside the three-sixteenths and tired. RUNNING ROSADO dropped back then was urged along at the rear, went
three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. NINE LINE BIND broke in at the start, settled towards the
rear, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground under urging on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to respond.
