Footnotes
LOVE MY BOSS unhurried early circled out while advancing on the far turn bidding five deep in upper stretch edging clear near mid track. CANDY
KINGDOM slow early lost ground to upper stretch firing outside of rivals six wide finishing well. SUPER VALENTINE stalked the pace pressing between
horses on the far turn extending in upper stretch weakening late. NEGRONI UP saved ground chasing in bid on the far turn, was in tight nearing the eighth
pole steadying there losing all momentum. THUNDER KID prompted the pace dueling through the far turn gradually wearing out the final eighth. MISTER
CHARMING stalked the pace saving ground to upper stretch fading along the rail. MACHO MANIA prompted the pace dueling on the far turn wearing out
while drifting in a bit upper stretch. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO AN INCIDENT OUTSIDE THE EIGHTH POLE RESULTED IN NO CHANGE.

SIR MICHAEL away alertly was pressured on a narrow lead through the turn shaking clear in upper stretch drawing out with plenty left. DUPLICATOR slow
early angled out to upper stretch rallying from mid track getting up for place. MONTMARTRE raced evenly angling four wide in upper stretch lacking surge
while holding position. SIDE CAR a step slow through the turn gave a mild rally into upper stretch finishing evenly. SCARED WARIOR stumbled then was
squeezed back at the break. FIRST VICTORY broke sharply pressing a brisk pace to upper stretch wilting the final eighth. ENDGAME flashed early speed
then faded on the turn. VICTOR'S DESTINY folded up on the turn.

HALF WAY went evenly chasing four wide to upper stretch making no headway on the winner while salvaging place. KENNEDIE SKY hopped in the air
missing the break, lagging through the far turn lost ground to upper stretch responding late to finish strong in the six path. SPRING CITY GAL slow early
raced inside to upper stretch bidding mildly in the two path. NICE RIDE stalked the pace chasing into upper stretch coming up short late. SURE SHE'S
GRAND stalked the pace while saving ground to upper stretch weakening late along the rail. SECRET TRICK played no factor. J'S HANDSOME FANA
raced mid pack tiring in upper stretch. HALO'S PARADISE hustled out set a pressured early pace wearing out on the far turn.
