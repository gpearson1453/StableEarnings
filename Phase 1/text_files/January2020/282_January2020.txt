finished second best. TORMENTA DE ORO moved up four wide on the second turn then was outfinished. KARA'S ANGEL pressed the pace two wide,
made the lead before a half, set the pace to the top of the stretch and weakened late. TWO STEP DANCER failed to menace. MISS OTIS offered a bid

handed urging. QUEEN CITY KITTY stalked the pace near the inside, shifted out to the five path entering the stretch, rallied determinedly but was too late to
catch the winner. SHAKE ME DIVA unhurried early, closed fast four wide through the stretch. TREASURE WILBURNYA allowed to settle, finished with good
courage along the inside. STAR OF PRIDE unhurried early, rallied steadily three wide into the stretch then leveled off. EDGE OF HONOR had her heels
clipped shortly after the start then failed to menace. GIFT FROM MOM passed tiring rivals. SMARTINA failed to menace. IT WILL HAPPEN away alertly, set
the pace near the inside for a half then weakened late. PAT'S WILL had brief speed. GINGERMYSISTER pressed the pace two wide into the turn then gave

Footnotes
ALYCAR FLASH prompted the pace two wide into the stretch, put a head in front and proved best under strong handling. KATALOX stalked the pace into
the stretch, dug in three wide and just missed getting up in time. RISKY GUY allowed to settle, found his best stride late four wide. MISTER EUROPA made
the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch then was outfinished in the final yards. EXCEPTIONAL CITY unhurried early, was steadily
gaining ground late inside. NOBLE DAVE settled in a stalking position the lacked the needed response. PERPETRATOR went evenly. CORKY'S THE
NAME was no threat. CHOSEN HEIR was outrun. OBSESSIONSOPTIMIST had speed for a half then faded. HIERRO COLADO (VEN) had brief speed.
SUM SONG was no factor.
