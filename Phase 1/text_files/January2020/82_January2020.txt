Footnotes
KNEESINTHEBREEZE bumped MR. MIKE when forced out by GALERIO near the four and a half furlongs pole, chased the pace three wide around the
turn, raced on his left lead until inside the eighth pole, gained the lead inside the sixteenth pole and held sway. MR. MIKE , outside foes down the
backstretch, was bumped near the four and a half furlongs pole, circled the turn four wide and rallied outside rivals. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND sped to the
early lead, set the pace in the two path around the turn, remained in the two path in the stretch and weakened late. HELLO AMIGO saved ground around
the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and failed to rally. GALERIO bore out when steadied in close quarters near the four and a half furlongs pole,
chased the pace in the two path between horses around the turn then came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
SIERRA LEONA prompted the early pace outside HAY BABY GIRL, dropped back a bit leaving the far turn, came under pressure mid turn, rebid under left
handed rousing and to the inside of foes past the furlong grounds, had her rider put the stick away after gaining command a sixteenth out and held firm
under nice handling. FLOATING BY settled in the clear leaving the five eighths, angled out and circled five to six wide into the lane, closed in while racing on
her left lead, lost her right hind bandage near the eighth pole, churned on but was denied. BANANA ANNA broke on top but outward, was taken back to last
soon after and angled in, angled out under pressure while moving up some into the lane, dropped back in for the final three sixteenths and steadily gained.
MUSIC MAKER rated close while saving some ground early on, eased out and pulled her way between foes to take command into the turn, spurted clear
and set the pace under a light hold, came under a ride while three to four wide in upper stretch, could not fend off rivals near the sixteenth marker and gave
way. NANA'S SHOES , five wide outside rivals heading towards the turn, gained five wide into the lane, loomed but came up empty in the final furlong.
CANOOCHEE , four wide stalking the pace, dropped back mid turn. HAY BABY GIRL took over leaving the chute, was pressured from her outside, ceded
nearing the turn, chased to mid turn then tired.

Footnotes
HENDAYA tracked a duel three wide, bid in hand outside rivals to take over with a quarter to go, edged away slightly while under a drive in mid stretch, was
displaced from her inside by JUDI BLUE EYES departing the sixteenth marker but battled back under strong handling to nip that one at the wire. JUDI BLUE
EYES , off of a contested pace while saving ground, moved up under a drive while cutting the corner into the lane, got through to continue progress past the
furlong grounds, gained a slim lead past the sixteenth pole, hung late and just missed. TOMA , off slowly, lagged back while towards the rail, angled out mid
turn, circled six wide into the stretch, ranged up past the eighth pole but flattened out late. NO QUESTION stalked behind the leaders heading to the turn,
eased out past the five sixteenths, chased four wide while in range between rivals in mid stretch but came up empty. IN CLASS engaged
TAKECHARGEMATRIARCH from her inside early on, dueled through a sharp opening quarter, gained command around the turn, ceded the lead past the
five sixteenths, came off the rail into the lane, stayed willingly to mid stretch then weakened. SIPPING CHAMPAGNE lacked speed, saved ground and
lacked a bid. SILENT FLUIDITY broke a step slow, angled out and chased off the inside, came five wide for the drive and faded. TAKECHARGMATRIARCH
, nudged to the front, disputed the pace outside IN CLASS, fought on to upper stretch and tired.

SING A VERSE lacked speed, raced in the two path through the stretch, split horses in mid stretch to take the lead then drew out. LET ME ASK BOB
stalked the pace, had a three wide bid for the lead in upper stretch and flattened out. PERFECT HEIR saved ground on the turn, remained along the rail in
upper stretch, swung to the five path in mid stretch, raced outside rivals and passed tired ones. LITTLE BAY hugged the inner rail on the turn, eased out,
loomed four deep at the head of the stretch and flattened out. FATHER'S LUCK sped to the early lead, angled in, set the pace along the rail and weakened
the final furlong. LIAR , pinched back after bobbling at the break, was outrun and angled to the seven path in upper stretch. IM THE GAME circled the turn
three wide, floated to the six path in upper stretch and weakened. BERRINCHE chased the pace two wide and faltered.

Footnotes
AWESOME FU cleared leaving the chute and set a rated pace about two wide, responded when set down in upper stretch, drifted in under right handed
asking in mid stretch, was corrected with the left stick, widened past the sixteenth marker and held firm. BOB'S MY UNCLE lagged off the pace and
removed from the inside, entered the stretch three wide while under a ride, split rivals inside the sixteenth marker and finished well. MAJOR FLIRT edged up
between foes nearing the three quarter pole and gained a stalking spot, tracked two wide around the turn, shifted out soon into the lane, gave hard chase
past the furlong grounds then faded. RUNABOUT hesitated at the break costing him a few lengths, regrouped and progressed towards the winner after a
quarter mile, stalked while saving ground, failed to kick on under pressure past mid stretch and faded. SAVVY STREET , taken to rate while saving ground,
moved closer turn mid turn, swung wide for the drive, chased and flattened out. CALCULATED RISKER lagged off the pace, raced five wide under coaxing
past the three eighths, shifted out very wide into the lane but failed to generate a rally. HAYNE'S FEVER , four to five wide past the three quarter pole,
stalked to the far turn and gave way. VENOMOUS STATE , three wide, steadied when appearing to want to lay in near the far turn, dropped back and failed
to recover. OCEANOGRAPHER , in about the two path in mid pack early, dropped back after a half mile.

Footnotes
STAKES ON A PLANE rated off the leaders soon after the break, tracked three wide, bid outside foes mid turn, dueled with NINE MARTINIS into the lane,
asserted herself after being set down in upper stretch and drew away while kept to task. NINE MARTINIS broke sharply and angled to the two path to set
the early pace, was joined from her inside by CONQUESTHARDCHERRY leaving the five eighths pole, sparred with that one into the turn, met the bid of
the winner past the three eighths, battled to the three sixteenths, failed to match strides soon after but kept on willingly to be a clear second.
CONQUESTHARDCHERRY lodged a rail bid leaving the five furlong marker, vied into the turn, gave hard chase past the five sixteenths and faded.
NEVISIAN SUNSET , off the pace, raced three to four wide into the lane and failed to menace. WORDS OF A FEATHER , in range while saving ground into
the turn, failed to kick on nearing the quarter pole and gave way. FORTRESSA , sluggish from the gate, came wide for the drive and never threatened.
