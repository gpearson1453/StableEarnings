RAMBLIN' MAN dueled two across to the stretch, fell back, continued under steady urging, got up near the sixteenth pole and drew off. CATS SURFIN was
never far off the pace, angled out for the drive, closed steadily and got up late for place. VALLEY WILDCAT was settled off the pace, swung wide leaving
the turn, lacked the needed late response and settled for show. EXCESSIVE KID was void of early speed, trailed the field and lacked a bid. CELTIC
WARRIOR lost his jockey and was vanned off. Hand timed.

SWAGSATIONAL was never far off the pace, saved ground, angled out on the turn, assumed command into the stretch, drew off and drifted out late.
TENACIOUS MOON raced close to the pace, bid inside on the turn, loomed a threat and was no match for the winner. JAMMERS JUSTICE stalked the
pace, was roused on the turn, swung seven wide, fell back, leveled off in the drive and held safely for show. WICKED WINNINGS set the pace to the
second turn, tired and gave way. HUNTINGTONS RITHM trailed the field. Hand timed. PER RULING #19-20TP137A FROM THE ARIZONA DEPARTMENT
OF GAMING, SWAGSATIONAL WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

SHACKMANDU dueled past the eighth pole, drew off for a clear lead and held well. I DUB THEE was never far off the pace, went five wide entering the
stretch, found his best stride late and was gaining ground. CALL ME ALVIN came in at the start and bumped, dueled to mid stretch, was unable to sustain
his bid and held safely for show. PIE O MY bumped and was crowded at the start, pressed the pace, bid inside on the turn to contend for the lead and gave
way past the eighth pole. EMPIRE PRINCE raced inside and had brief speed only. CHICOTE was off slowly, advanced outside to the turn, swung wide and
gave way.

Footnotes
ARIZONA RY set the pace and held safely under steady urging. SAVAGE WARRIOR saved ground, angled out on the backstretch, bid six wide, closed
steadily to earn place and was no match for the winner. AT TWILIGHT TIME was steadied at the start to be off slowly, raced in the back outside, bid nine
wide at the top of the stretch and closed to get up for show. ENOUGH OF THAT hesitated at the start to off slowly, was unhurried early, saved ground, bid
inside on the turn and didn't have enough late. ELUSIVE FLAME raced mid pack, went seven wide entering the stretch and lacked the needed rally.
GOOCH EXPRESS stalked the pace, bid willingly, hung and lost position. DANTHEMANLEVITAN raced in the back, went eight wide leaving the turn and
lacked a bid. MAE BELLE PASSE raced mid pack, bid inside to get within striking distance and came up empty. HERKIMER STORM was through after a
half. FORTHWITH went five wide on the first turn, stalked the pace to the second turn, tired and stopped.

EDDYSHAK stalked the pace, challenged for the lead into the turn, fell back into the stretch, continued willingly to duel and proved best. ROCKET SHIP
raced six wide along the backstretch, swung wide on the turn, closed steadily and got up for place. MEET JOE vied early, drew clear into the stretch,
responded to duel and yielded in the final strides. REVENGE AGAIN was unhurried early, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked the needed rally. ROCKY
BOY INDIAN raced mid pack in an even effort. ROAD ROMEO challenged three across on the second turn, fell back and faded from contention.
IMBETTINONBRUTUS was hustled along, vied two across, was through after a half, stopped and was eased late. BRINGINDOWNDAHOUSE failed to
contend and was not urged through the stretch.

Footnotes
THE ADRIE FACTOR was checked on the first turn, raced mid pack, rallied on the second turn, went six wide entering the stretch, assumed command and
drew off under urging. TOTALLY NORMAL was steadied on the first turn, raced in the back, finished well inside and was no match for the winner. NAVY
QUEEN chased the pace, went widest in the drive and earned show under strong urging. OUR MAGIC MOMENT bumped at the start, raced close to the
pace, bid and came up empty. STREET FLYER came in on the first turn, set the pace to the stretch, tired and gave way. VERY BOISTEROUS bumped at
the start, saved ground, bid inside and had nothing left for the drive. CHICLE SPARKS got away well inside, was checked hard on the firs turn, fell back and
went evenly thereafter. RED NOVA was crowded into the first turn and did not threaten. Following a trainer's claim of foul, STREET FLYER was disqualified
and placed seventh for causing interference on the turn. Hand timed.

Footnotes
ALL ABOUT TRUMP was off a step slowly, rallied on the turn, bid six wide, closed willingly, assumed command past the eighth pole, drew off and won
going away. BUBBA BAY was slow early, raced outside, bid seven wide to earn place and was no match for the winner. DOING FINE trailed the field, found
his best stride and got up late for show. INTELICRYPT dueled to mid stretch and gave way. MAGNETAR bumped at the start, raced close to the pace, bid
along the rail to threaten and came up empty. FACTORY MADE bumped at the start, raced mid pack, swung wide on the turn and dropped back. SUNSET
BRANDY dueled to the turn and stopped.
