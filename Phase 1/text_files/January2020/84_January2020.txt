Footnotes
BRIDGETOTHEFUTURE established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside, had a trio advance outside and vied
inside those rivals headed for command near the three-eighths, came under coaxing at that station, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
coming again to issue a challenge through the final eighth to take command a sixteenth out, then inched away to the finish to prevail. FINAL SAY five to six
wide down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn advancing to stack outside a trio midway, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung
four wide for home, dug in heads apart for command to the sixteenth marker when displaced in tandem by the top one, fought on to procure the place
honors on the wire. PLEBE bobbled at the break, raced three wide in closest aim of the leader before advancing to vie between foes through the turn from
the two path taking over command at the three-eighths, came under coaxing at that station, swung three wide for home, dug in under threat loosely between
challengers from the eighth pole until headed a sixteenth out, then kept on to the finish but was bested for the place honors. SEEDISKID chased just off the
inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. DREAMMASTER chased three to four wide
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response. CRYPTO GOLD five then four wide in pursuit,
came under coaxing half a mile from home and advanced to vie three wide between foes through the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
MISS LIANA retained the advantage after out-breaking the competition, inched its way over to the rail, getting there prior to arriving at the conclusion of the
backstretch, edged away from the others during the run around the end, achieving it without need of encouragement from the pilot, was deep into the
furlong grounds when finally asked for her best, held on well in the final stages to prevail. CRUISING STRONG underwent a two wide pursuit on the turn,
came under stronger handling by the five-sixteenths pole, angled into path four for the drive home, rallied down the center of the strip to garner the place.
BODES SUNSET pressed the winner from the two path, rated along for much of the opening half, commenced the stretch one path farther off the inside, got
outfinished. TIZ EPIC took up the chase three to four wide on the turn while getting roused, fanned out into path six from upper to midlane, venturing on as
the widest of all, made no impact. SUNFLOWER ROSE bobbled slightly losing her footing at the start, was quickly spotted along the rail, failed to make her
presence felt. SPEED TALKS three wide on the turn, was a couple of paths wider at the top of the lane, gave way.

SECRET RULES established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from a pair to the outside through swift splits,
remained patiently handled through the turn, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, got set down straightened away for home, drew off under a drive to
prevail. POLAR BEAR PETE bumped at the start by HIM SHE KISSES who recovered outwards from a bobble, chased two to three wide under coaxing
from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. TRASH TALKER
prompted the pace four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. HIM SHE KISSES
bobbled at the break recovering outwards and bumping POLAR BEAR PETE, pressed the leader from the three path under coaxing from the three-eighths,
got shaken off near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide for home and tired. KING OF AMERICAN away without incident under coaxing from the gate,
was devoid of speed and grew detached at the tail of the field chasing three wide down the backstretch and then from the two path through the turn, came
under light coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch under a drive, trailed throughout closing in belatedly on the field to the
finish before galloping out to the front a sixteenth after the wire.

Footnotes
JACQUELINE D remained forwardly placed after the field had been sent off and running, stalked the pacesetter towards the two path, challenged in earnest
at the three-sixteenths pole, emerged a few jumps later in charge, drifted out several paths in the last sixteenth, initially from some left side pressure and
afterwards under her own volition, managed to kick further clear nonetheless. STARS WILBURN worked out a tuck into the two path coming up to the half
mile pole, stayed within striking distance of the front runners, got cued up being maneuvered into path four for the drive home, rallied for the place.
STARLITE MISSION tracked the pace from just off the inside, going about the task hand urged on the turn, was more in the two path spinning into the
stretch, went on to secure the show. MY CHESA CHARM cleared over to the inside after establishing the top, showed the way stationed on the right rim of
the inside route, succumbed when put to the test in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths maker, backed away in the last eighth. MAGARI made contact with
the side of the gate after tossing her head right before the field had been sprung, was three wide entering the turn and sent out four wide exiting it, made no
impact. MIMI MEDIA sat reserved two wide during the initial stages, fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, straightened away and improved
position going a pair of weak and tired ones. PARLAPIANO dove over to the rail, came up empty when set down at the five-sixteenths pole. PRINCESS
MIKAYAH towards the back of the pack, travelled three wide on the turn, was moved out five during the initial portion of the stretch, never got involved.

Footnotes
FORGOTTEN HERO broke on top lunging out at the start, wasted no time establishing control, sailed along on an uncontested lead while taking the two
path, was still comfortably in front leading the competition into the stretch, alternated between the inside route and the two path making her way down it, was
at the furlong grounds when put to a stronger ride, saw the runner up looming boldly in deep stretch, arrived at the finish line in time to win the bob.
PUFFERY underwent a two wide pursuit, between rivals for a good portion of the opening half, got cued up for the drive home, chipped away at the deficit
all the while drafting behind the one to catch beginning from around the eighth pole, altered course to the rail after espying the winner solidly positioned in
the two path in deep stretch, continued to narrow in, missed. BERTRANDA took up the chase three wide on the turn, swung into the lane, gained on the
winner, but ultimately had to settle for the show. ARCHUMYBABY tracked the loose leader from along the inside route without benefit of being covered up,
got driven into the four path heading for the three-sixteenths pole, rallied mildly. ORCHID PARTY saved ground for the opening half, was worked into path
five from upper to midstretch, had no rally. SPRING DRAMA gathered after breaking to the outside, underwent a four wide pursuit on the turn, went into the
lane and had no offering.

Footnotes
MY ROXY GIRL four wide in range of the front, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just
outside the eighth pole, edged away under a drive to prevail. SEA SPARKLE got bumped at the start by OK HONEY who broke out while under hustling,
dueled early on along the inside of CARRIZO as that rival was joined to the outside by a pair, briefly vied with a trio before slipping away to sole command
through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths coming under pressure once more, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in and was collared
near the eighth pole, kept on to secure the place honors. MO FLASH off last to an awkward beginning, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then three wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. JUMP FOR JOY
coaxed from the gate, raced three wide in aim of the front, advanced to be between foes through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun
just off the inside for home, tipped out as her seam closed down straightened away and weakened in the late stages. CARRIZO hustled from the gate,
dueled from the two path with SEA SPARKLE to her inside coaxed along from the get go, got joined by a pair to the outside down the backstretch and
through the turn, faded near the quarter pole, went four wide for home and weakened in the stretch. ANNIE ROCKS chased three to four wide until tucked to
the two path at the half mile pole, came under coaxing three furlongs out, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. OK HONEY
broke out at the start bumping SEA SPARKLE, chased briefly just off the inside before tipping out to the six path five furlongs from home, tucked back along
the inside into the turn, went eight wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
SOLITARY GEM took up position in midpack proceeding along the backstretch, slid into the pocket approaching the half mile pole, was patiently ridden
closing the gap during the final stages of the run around the bend, began to move to the outside as three-quarters was being finished, bobbled, appearing to
clip the heels of PRINCESS IN CHARGE in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, got steered into path five to be well clear of the aforementioned
opponent upon recovery, forged on ahead to take over by the eighth pole, saw the pilot drop the whip with about a sixteenth to go, was switched over to a
hand drive and kicked clear. NASTY AFFAIR away the tardiest after coming in slightly at the start, departed the backstretch towards path two, picked up
interest as the third fraction was being finalized, angled six wide in the stretch for the best of clearance, rallied with some willingness to garner the place.
PRINCESS IN CHARGE disputed the pace two to three wide, was put to some encouragement turning into the stretch, seemed to be clipped from behind
by the winner soon afterwards, proceeded to drift out in the direction of the four path, backed away in the final furlong. SMILES FROM SADIE reserved two
wide, took up the chase from between rivals on the turn, was moved out about six wide from upper to midlane, made no impact. REMEMBERING BOBBIE
vied from along the inside route until the furlong grounds and faltered. BARBARA P sent over to the rail nearing the end of the backstretch, came up empty
after cutting the corner into the lane. INSTINCTIVE strung out three wide on the turn, gave way.
