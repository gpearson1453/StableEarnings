Footnotes
CHICLE SPARKS stalked the pace, assumed command on the turn, drew off and extended her lead under mild urging. COIL AND STRIKE bumped and
was steadied at the start, was steadied again entering the first turn, raced close to the pace, offered a mild bid only and was no match for the winner.
ESTRELLA POLAR bumped at the start, raced outside, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and was along for show. EZ PC DREAMER bumped at the
start, was never far back while racing outside and lacked a stretch response. OWEN'S SHOT bumped at the start, saved ground, bid off the rail and came
up empty. CLONGIFFEN bumped on both sides at the start, set a pressured pace, tired on the turn, stopped and was not urged late. DARK N TWISTY
raced far back while wide, failed to contend and showed little.

Footnotes
PARLEY STREET raced close to the pace, went five wide entering the stretch, closed willingly, got up past the eighth pole and drew off. INTELICRYPT set
the pace past the eighth pole, was outclosed and just held for place. ALL ABOUT TRUMP broke slowly, advanced to the turn, bid six wide, had the rider
lose his whip in the drive and finished well. DAD'S A GAMBLER raced mid pack in a steady effort and didn't have enough late. CHIEF A CHIEF'S pressed
the pace to mid stretch and gave way. HE COULD improved position in an even effort. TOUCHDOWN U S C pressed between horses, was in tight entering
the turn, bid inside and came up empty. DOING FINE was not a factor. COUNT YOUR MONEY moved up inside, was in tight entering the turn, dropped
back and gave way. PUBLIC ENEMY had brief speed only.

SINCERE WARNING drew clear on the turn, was under pressure through the stretch and held under steady urging. STATELY COMMAND vied inside, fell
back on the turn, went willingly to the wire and couldn't gain ground. GATHAN'S GIRL chased inside, angled out for the drive, lacked the needed rally and
settled for show. ROYAL KINGDOM raced mid pack outside, went ten wide at the top of the stretch and closed well. BANDOLERA'S GOLD dropped back
on the turn, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid. LADY FREEDOM was not a factor. LOVLEY SPY broke slowly and trailed the field.

YO Y ME pressed the pace, challenged three across on the turn, drew clear and held well under steady urging. MYSTICAL IMAGE was reluctant to load,
set a pressured pace to the turn, fell back, continued under strong handling and narrowed the gap. EXECUTIVE DECREE was boxed in and in tight along
the backstretch, angled out once clear, bid and hung. CREATIVE ART was in tight between horses along the backstretch, went seven wide at the top of the
stretch and offered a mild bid only. BLUE LAW was void of early speed and put in an even effort in a wide trip. STORMCHASER was in tight along the
backstretch, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and failed tor rally. MIKE MAN'S GOLD pressed the pace inside, was checked entering the turn, fell
back and faded.

Footnotes
TIZ SIMPLY AWESOME set a pressured pace to the turn, drew off and extended her lead under urging. LADY HIGBEE bumped at the start, raced inside,
closed well and got up for place while no threat to the winner. MISS WINE TOPPER raced close to the pace, lacked the needed late response and settled
for show. EL BELL CAMP pressed the pace while racing inside, challenged for the lead on the turn, fell back and hung late. GO MARTHA GO showed good
early speed while racing outside, steadily faded and did not threaten. BEEJAYSBAR bumped at the start, went nine wide at the top of the stretch and lacked
a bid. TOCCALOT was not a factor. TOOCLOSETOCALL broke in and got away slowly, trailed the field, was eased late and walked off.
