BUB chased the leaders to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch, rallied to get to terms in mid stretch, inched away then held off IVORIAN stubbornly.
IVORIAN was outsprinted to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch, rallied in the drive and finished steadily to just miss. MARINOS LAW attended the
pace from the rail to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then was overtaken and outfinished late. DYNAMIC DUO chased the leaders from the rail to the
stretch, responded in the final furlong but was outkicked in the late stages. CHIEF EAGLE EYE hustled and contested the pace outside a rival to the stretch,
was collared in mid stretch and also outfinished. RI' PIN SNAP had no speed and was not a factor.

BUTTIE was unhurried to the half mile pole, bid two then three wide on the second turn, rallied to the front in mid stretch and pushed clear under steady
urging. STREETLIGHTROMANCE lagged to the second turn, closed the gap in the two path then swung out four deep into the stretch, could not impact the
winner but wore down IT'S ALEXUS for the place. IT'S ALEXUS was four wide on the first turn, settled to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, got
to terms in upper stretch but was outkicked by the winner, weakened late and could not save second. OUR RENEE broke a bit slow but had good speed
and went right to the front, was clear to the second turn, got overtaken after six furlongs and tired. SIDE EFFECT (GB) chased the pace to the second turn,
bid two wide to loom a threat to the stretch then also tired.

THE SPIRAL JETTER was outrun to the turn, circled four wide to the stretch, rallied widest in the drive and pushed to the front. LEFT ALONE (GB) stalked
the pace two wide, got to terms into the stretch, pushed away to mid stretch then was tiring, could not stall the winner and just saved the place. SPRING
HEAT was outsprinted to the turn, came two wide to the stretch then closed steadily and just missed second. PREMIERE LADY tracked the leaders three
wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. SARI'S TIGER broke slow and lost almost five lengths to begin, lagged from the rail to the stretch and
was never a threat. IMPECUNIOUS hustled to zip clear in the opening quarter, was collared and dueled from the rail to the stretch then tired in the lane.
SPANISH MAGIC chased the pace early, offered a bid two wide but tired before going a half, stopped in the stretch and was not asked late.

Footnotes
KONA SKYE brushed with TIZ EMMA at the start but was quickest to the first turn, set the pace from the rail to the stretch, dug in determinedly in the late
stages and held SWEET BOY safe. SWEET BOY The latter pressed the winner two wide to the stretch then closed steadily but was too late. TIZ EMMA
settled to the half, raced two wide on the second turn then was outkicked to mid stretch but closed the gap to the wire. DEEPINGREEN was also allowed to
settle, saved ground on the second turn but lacked the needed late response. PIVO stalked the top two three wide to the stretch then weakened. CREATIVE
BULL had no speed and was not a threat.
