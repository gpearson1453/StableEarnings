SECRETLY PARANOIDE pressed the pace to the turn, came two wide to the stretch, rallied to collar ENCHANTING EVA in mid stretch then pushed clear
late. ENCHANTING EVA set the pace from the rail to the stretch, resisted rivals to mid stretch then battled on to hold second. BLUSHING BAY had no
speed, had to go four wide on the turn and was making up ground belatedly. DIXIE PEGGY chased the pace to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch to
loom boldly in mid stretch then was outfinished in the late stages. NOBLE GIRL stalked the pace from the rail to the stretch, remained a threat to mid stretch
then finished evenly. CLOUDS OF JOY chased the pace to the turn, weakened then stopped in the stretch.

closing the gap in the late stages. HARDY CHISEL broke clear but was outsprinted for the lead, chased two wide to the stretch then lacked a closing
response. ROYAL BAR broke out and bumped and squeezed NERVOUS NELLIE, chased from the rail then was outrun to the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MR. Q rated kindly to the second turn, circled four wide to the stretch, got to the front in mid stretch then edged clear driviing. ALLEYCAT checked shortly
after the start, trailed to the second turn, was three wide then swung out widest for the drive and came on late for the place. SAYIN GRACE pressed the
pace to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch, had the rider drop his whip in upper stretch, dueled to the furlong grounds then weakened. REY
COLIMAN was settled to the half, raced two wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. PIONEEROFTHESTORM set the pace for six
furlongs, drifted out into the stretch and weakened. RUSTIC CANYON settled mid pack to the half, saved ground on the second turn but tired after six
furlongs.

STUDLY PERFECTION sped to a clear lead, set the pace from the rail, responded on the second turn then held determinedly in the drive. SOLOMON BAY
chased the winner to the second turn, was two wide and outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task and was gaining late to get the place. RUN LIKE RHETT
had no speed, settled to the half, advanced four wide on the second turn, got outrun by the winner to mid stretch but finished willingly while giving up
second. MONSAJEM PERVADE had no speed, trailed to the second turn, circled five wide to the stretch and was closing ground but too late. CRAZY
PROPHET chased the winner to the second turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch, was gaining in the late stages but was not a serious threat.
GOING FOR THE WIN settled to the half, was three wide to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
LEONILLA was unhurried to the half, circled five wide to the stretch then rallied in the drive, battled PURE PERFECTION through the final sixteenth and
gamely got the nod. PURE PERFECTION was settled for a half mile, bid three wide on the second turn, rallied to get on terms with the winner leaving the
furlong grounds, dug in determinedly and just missed. WAR MOCCASIN broke a bit slow and trailed to the second turn, was four wide then swung out six
deep into the stretch and finished willingly. TOP TIZZY set the pace while two wide to the stretch, was collared in mid stretch and weakened. CEDARS OF
LEBANON (IRE) pressed TOP TIZZY to the second turn, rallied three wide and battled to mid stretch then also weakened. CASH FOR CASS tracked the
pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch but gave way in the late stages. OURSENSATIONALGIRL stalked the pace to the second turn, bid four
wide to the stretch but tired in the drive.

SMOKIN HOT BOBBIE stalked the leaders to the turn, was two wide to the stretch then angled out for room, rallied once clear, battled STRADARI and
gamely inched away from that one. STRADARI was a pace factor from the outset, raced two deep to the stretch, dug in when hooked by the winner but was
outfinished in the final sixteenth. SAY YES SALLY had good speed, dueled from the rail to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened.
ANNA LEE ENCORE chased the leaders three wide to the stretch then did not rally.

Footnotes
MEGAMEISTER had the best speed, set all the pace to the second turn, turned back DIRT ROAD RED in mid stretch and edged clear driving. DIRT ROAD
RED pressed the winner to the second turn, made a bid to mid stretch then was outfinished while not threatened for second. ROWDYROOSTER had no
speed, settled to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch but was never a threat. SPEEDING RUNING was chasing the top two for five furlongs, got
outrun to the stretch and did not rally. BOTTLE OF SMOKE pressed the pace early then also chased to the second turn, got outrun to the stretch and
weakened. AERO STREET had no speed and saved ground to no avail. TOP DOLLAR was rank and forced to steady off heels on the first turn then was not
a factor. FORT JACKSON showed little.
