Footnotes
ABOGADA chased the pace two wide into the far turn, rallied in the two path to make the lead in upper stretch, and proved best in a stiff drive while fully
extended. REBEL LIONESS with the second flight three wide, was forced out at the top of the stretch, dug in determinedly four wide and got up for second.
MISS OTIS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace off the rail in the three path, drifted to the six path entering the stretch giving up ground
then came on again late three wide. TORMENTA DE ORO never far back, closed with good courage along the rail through the stretch. QUEENA ESTHER
was in tight behind a rival while three wide through the clubhouse turn, settled with the second flight two wide down the backstretch, dropped inside after a
half then went evenly. VELVET SAMI failed to menace. SLOW DANCE was through after a half.

J'S HANDSOME FANA with the second flight three wide, responded with a burst of speed under left handed urging through upper stretch, made the lead
lead and drew off under a strong hand ride. IT'S SPRINGTIME away alertly, set the pace until deep stretch then was no match for the winner.
SHESWILDNFREE pressed the pace two wide and went evenly. A GIRL HAS NO NAME stalked the pace three wide into the far turn, shifted outside to the
six path then weakened in the stretch. OPTIMISTIC SHOT failed to menace. DRESSED IN HEELS was a froward factor along the rail into the far turn then
gave way.

Footnotes
LION LION settled in the five path down the backstretch, circled rivals four wide through the second turn and into the stretch, matched strides past the
furlong marker and shook clear late under brisk handling. RAPID FIRE bobbled outward at the start, was allowed to settle, circled rivals readily four wide
before a half, matched strides for the lead until deep stretch and finished second best in a determined effort. OVERWATCH dueled for the lead two wide into
the far turn, dropped back a bit, altered course to the six path near the furlong marker giving up ground then came on again late. U. S. MILLENNIUM stalked
the early pace three wide, went up to challenge the lead before a half, matched strides until deep stretch then was outfinished. MAKEANENTRANCE failed
to menace. MONFORD dueled for the lead along the inside into the second turn then gave way. DIDDY DEW was no factor. KALI'S RANSOM trailed.

Footnotes
BAD KARMA stalked the pace four wide down the backstretch, rallied three wide on the turn, made the lead nearing the top of the stretch, shook clear under
left handed urging and prevailed under a hand ride. WAVERLY SUNSET unhurried early, closed fast in the five path through the stretch and was steadily
cutting into the winners advantage late. SOUTH BEACH GIRL broke in front, battled for the early lead three wide, dropped inside while setting the pace
through the turn then was outfinished in the final stages. BLESSINGSOFLIBERTY vied for the lead along the inside and went evenly. MISS
INTERNATIONAL never far back, moved up two wide through the turn then failed to sustain that bid. HOPES AND PRAYERS pressed the pace two wide
into the turn then gradually weakened. CAPTAIN ANNE was no factor. MISS KETTLE ZIP trailed.

LOCK ON vied for the lead while saving ground along the rail, drew on even terms for the lead at the top of the stretch, matched strides to the wire and
proved best by a narrow margin. VINNY BOY away alertly, set a pressured pace in the two path into the stretch, dug in determinedly when challenged by
the winner, dueled to the wire and just missed hanging on. TREBEK bumped at the start, loomed boldly three wide into the stretch and was outfinished in a
game effort. ADVENTUROUS FOX chased the early pace four wide and weakened in the stretch. BOBBY V. moved up five wide on the turn then came up
empty. ONE BUCK ROMA bumped at the start and was no threat. SHOE LOVES SHOE had speed six wide into the turn and was used up.

Footnotes
LITTLE MATILDA never far back, closed willingly four wide through the stretch, made the lead at the sixteenth pole and drew clear under a brisk hand ride.
SHEFLEW dueled fie the early lead, two wide, set a pressured pace until deep stretch then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. GLORIOUS
FREEDOM stalked the pace the entire trip and finished determinedly along the rail. STURN DONNA found her best stride late in the seven path. COME ON
CALLIE vied for the lead three wide into the turn, inched closer then leveled off. CELEBRATEME wide early, was no threat. MS. NINEONESEVEN had brief
speed. MAMA LELA was no factor. NO HONEY MONEY raced a wide trip while no threat. ZEMO showed little. CAROL was through early.
