hold the place. LUCKY ANTARES chased the top two from the rail to the stretch, was not a threat to the winner and just missed second. EXACTAMENTE

Footnotes
JUST CLASSY was never far back, rallied three wide to the stretch, pushed to the front in mid stretch and held under steady urging. CHARLIE'S BELLE had
no speed, raced off the rail on the second turn then finished willingly inside for the place. SNOW PACK also had no speed, settled to the second turn, had to
circle rivals four wide to the stretch, finished steadily but missed second. RAELEE tracked the pace to the second turn, was three wide then got outkicked to
mid stretch but picked off rivals in the final sixteenth. TEXT DONT CALL set the pace from the rail for six furlongs then weakened. TEASPOON OF PEPPER
pressed TEXT DONT CALL to the second turn, moved up to briefly engage for the lead two wide to the stretch but was tiring in the drive. MAMANUCA had
no speed, raced two wide on both turns but was never a threat. FIGHTING BEAUTY settled mid pack to the second turn then saved ground but weakened
through the stretch. SHEZ A GRINDER hesitated at the break and came out four or five lengths last then was not a factor.

late. PRAISE LOUDLY chased the top two from the rail to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task to the line. TIZ PERFECTION was

then came up empty in the stretch. OPERA GHOST was chasing to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch but weakened in the lane. AWAY HE GOES trailed

Footnotes
FAR WEST was outsprinted to the turn, eased off the rail mid turn, was caught in traffic behind rivals in upper stretch, waited for room, split rivals when a
hole developed and closed fast to win going away. BABY YOU GOT IT tracked the pace from the rail to the stretch, pushed to the front in mid stretch but
could not stall the winner late. CARTERS BLUE had no speed, chased to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch and finished in a mild rally.
CHANGING IMAGE also had no speed, swung out five wide into the stretch and was making up ground in the late stages. HARDY CHISEL was used to get
the lead, set the pace from the rail to the stretch, was collared nearing mid stretch and weakened. BEL'S BLESSING pushed hard to show speed but was
outsprinted, raced three wide to the stretch but tired in the final furlong. BERNARDOS HIDEAWAY hustled to prompt the pace two wide to the stretch then
also tired. SMILING MATT had no speed and was not a factor.
