Footnotes
LAVENDER (IRE) angled in and saved ground chasing the pace, came out in upper stretch and rallied under urging to gain the lead in deep stretch and
proved best. DANCE COSTUME chased outside a rival then three deep into and on the turn and into the stretch and got up for the place three wide on the
line. VA VA VOOM sped to the early lead, set a pressured pace inside then inched away into and on the turn, drifted out a bit from the whip in midstretch
and just held third between foes late. MELA JONES pressed the pace between foes then stalked a bit off the rail into and on the turn and into the stretch,
angled to the inside past midstretch, bid along the rail and was edged for the show. RANEEM prompted the pace three deep then stalked outside a rival into
and on the turn and into the stretch, came out some in the drive and was outfinished for a minor award. MALIBU CAT broke a bit slowly, stalked inside then
just off the rail into and on the turn and into the stretch, came out some in the drive and could not quite summon the needed late kick.

midstretch and edged a rival for the place. PALACE PRINCE close up stalking the winner between horses then inside leaving the turn and in the stretch and
