Footnotes
KOOL AID GIRL raced under a tight hold in the three path on the first turn, was rated outside on the backstretch, ranged up two to three wide on the far turn,
was asked near the three-eighths, made a bid passing the five-sixteenths, took the lead in upper stretch, shook clear inside the furlong marker and drew
away under steady urging. COMPROMISING saved ground under a snug hold on the first turn, was rated just off the pace on the inside, was asked early on
the far turn, chased on that bend, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out under a drive inside the three-sixteenths and got up for the place while
no match for the winner. STAR PERFORMER went to the front, set the pace on the inside through glacial fractions, was asked under pressure from the
winner at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong, moved out shortly thereafter and
weakened then was caught for the place while well clear for the show. D'OR FILLE was rated in the two path, dropped back leaving the backstretch while
moving out, was roused while three to four wide on the far turn and came up empty. WORD OF THE DAY was rank under tight restraint in the two path on
the first turn then reserved at the back, saved ground while put to urging on the far turn and failed to respond. JUST CRUISING went four wide on the first
turn, moved up late on that bend, stalked the pace on the outside, came up empty into the far turn and stopped.

Footnotes
WHIMSICAL MUSE bobbled at the start, went around the first turn in the three path, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the far turn,
was asked in the four path into the stretch, kicked clear at the three-sixteenths, switched back to her inside lead when put to a right-handed whip coming to
the furlong marker then swapped quickly back to the proper lead, switched back to her inside lead again outside the sixteenth-pole, remained clear at that
point then was fully extended to last. LA VIDA went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside in the second flight, was urged along in the two path
on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch under the whip, pursued the winner into the final furlong, gained on that foe late and just missed while well
clear for the place. CIRRUSLY reared badly at the start and was off very slow, spotted the front many lengths, went three wide on the first turn, settled near
the back, was urged along while four then five wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and improved position to get the show. CHIKARA bobbled
hard at the start then bumped soundly with foes on both sides, checked while pinched back between those rivals, went around the first turn in the two path,
settled near the back, was urged along while three then four wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, drifted in inside the three-sixteenths and
failed to threaten. INDOMITABLE SPIRIT was carried six wide into the first turn then dropped to five wide midway through that bend, settled in the middle of
the field, was roused in the two path on the far turn, came under the whip into upper stretch and failed to rally. SEVEN JEWELS went to the front, contested
the pace on the inside, was urged along on the far turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and gave way. SURPRISE ARRIVAL lugged out into
the first turn, went five then four wide on that bend, settled in the second flight, dropped back in the four path on the far turn, moved in a bit into the stretch
then was carried in inside the three-sixteenths and came up empty. KORAT QUEEN angled in at the start, settled on the inside, dropped back under urging
leaving the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path under a drive, drifted out near the furlong marker and failed
to respond. SOCO UNBRIDLED bobbled inward at the start then bumped soundly with a rival and was taken up, spotted the front several lengths, settled in
the back half of the field, was urged along while saving ground on the far turn and also failed to respond. SARAHCAIN bumped soundly with a rival at the
start, checked off heels nearing the first turn, went four wide on that bend, was taken up inside the three-quarter pole, raced on the outside at the rear, came
under urging around the five-eighths, dropped to the back late on the backstretch and faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off. (Rail at 9 Feet)

Footnotes
CLOSE TO ME got away just a half-step slowly but quickly recovered to obtain position tracking the leading pair from off the rail, began to edge closer on
the turn gradually moving out three then four deep by the five-sixteenths pole, struck the lead from outside past the quarter pole, was kept to the task and
extended the margin in the lane. MY MY MY was reserved early shifting in toward the rail trailing up the backstretch, moved inside a rival into the turn going
just off the rail through that bend while advancing some, came into the stretch in the four path then moved out five deep by the three-sixteenths, took over
the place position in mid-stretch and fought on to preserve that late. STRONG PATRIOT broke outwardly, pressed the pacesetter up the backstretch, went
three wide outside that one through the turn, obtained a brief lead at the top of the stretch but could not kick with the winner was outfinished for place.
KENAI COOL was slightly forced out at the break then altered inside STRONG PATRIOT soon after, raced off the inside up the backstretch going in the
three to four path on the turn, was last into the stretch and failed to rally. OUR LUCKY STAR set the early pace with some pressing by an outside rival early,
fought on in the two path on the turn as that foe obtained a narrow advantage then weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
TWIST OFF settled at the rear racing off the inside, went in the three then four path on the turn given some mild coaxing, swung six wide into upper stretch
and put to a drive, made the lead late to prevail. LAUGHING BOBBY set a pressured pace in the two path on a narrow margin, dispatched outside foes in
upper stretch but was overtaken by TWIST OFF late and was hard-ridden to hold the place from COOL QUARTET, who switched out from the rail early up
the backstretch, tracked in behind just off the leaders two then three wide on the turn, came into upper stretch four deep and asked for more past the quarter
pole, found room between rivals in late stretch and gained steadily but too late. V MAN pressed the pace from outside going three wide on the turn, drifted
out a bit in upper stretch while still in contention then weakened late. FLASHYBOY BOBB chased the pace from outside going four wide on the turn and five
wide by the top of the stretch, could not kick on with the top ones. TREBULSKI shifted in early and moved up along the rail up the backstretch to track inside
a foe, saved ground on the turn but dropped back and was unable to threaten.

Footnotes
VACATION LOVER was hustled from the start, went three wide on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, moved out leaving the backstretch,
chased three then four wide on the far turn, pursued the leader under a drive in upper stretch, took the lead at the furlong marker then edged clear under
steady urging. ARABIAN STORY stumbled awkwardly at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, went five then four wide on the first turn,
settled off the pace, was urged along while three wide on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and finished willingly for the place.
MIDNIGHT PATRIOT lugged out into the first turn, went six then five wide on that bend, disputed the pace on the outside, took the lead in the three path on
the far turn, moved clear outside the quarter-pole, came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the lead at the furlong marker and weakened but saved a share
of the show. DACK JANIEL'S was taken in hand early, raced in the two path under restraint on the first turn, settled down the backstretch, was urged along
in the two path on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get a share of the show. BENELUX was off slow
and spotted the front a few lengths, lugged out into the first turn, went four wide on that bend, settled off the pace, was urged along while four wide on the
far turn, came five wide into the stretch and improved position. TORNADO BOY went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, contested the pace,
was headed under urging while inside on the far turn and gave way. ARCHRIVAL was forced out seven wide into the first turn then dropped to six wide
midway through that bend, settled towards the rear on the outside, was ridden along while three to four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch
under a drive and failed to threaten. TAP KING went four wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace on the outside, dropped back under urging while four
wide on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. DISTORED HALF went around the first turn in the two path, settled well back in the
field, was urged along while just off the inside on the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch and was no factor. WICKED STATEMENT went three wide
on the first turn, settled off the pace, was ridden along late on the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the two path, turned into the stretch under the whip
and failed to respond. EAT THE TICKET was wrestled back early then taken up between horses, went three to four wide on the turns and showed little.
MIRA stumbled awkwardly at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, was rank under tight restraint on the initial straightaway, lugged out
into the first turn, went six then five wide on that bend, raced towards the rear, went four to five wide on the far turn and never reached contention. (Rail at 9

Footnotes
ONEHOLYLION moved forward to set the pace along the rail early, came out a bit midway up the backstretch to the two path, shifted back in early on the
turn still hounded from outside, came off the fence into upper stretch, was put to a drive and edged clear near the sixteenth pole. RUSTON VOW pursued
the early pace racing well off the rail but inside MADELYN'S WILD MAX, went three then four wide on the turn still inside that rival, drifted out a bit in late
stretch bumping that one and got up over him for the place. MADELYN'S WILD MAX was bumped between rivals at the start but recovered to quickly gain
forward position stalking from outside, went five wide through the turn, kept on in the stretch despite being lightly bumped late but was outfinished for
second. KING BANDIT pressed outside the winner three wide on the turn, was in contention till near the sixteenth pole but gave way late. RAHFEES MAN
was bumped soon after the break, shifted in two wide and moved up to be close to the leaders, continued two to three deep through the turn, was asked for
more past the five-sixteenths but failed to rally while running on evenly. MYBLENDOFWHISKY got away alertly then settled into stride shifting in up the
backstretch, saved ground on the rail through the turn but failed to rally. CHRISTOPHER CAT broke outwardly then came in sharply after the start, chased
from outside going four to five wide on the turn, came into upper stretch six deep and under urging but failed to threaten. SEAN bumped the inside rival at
the start then exchanged contact with an outside foe shortly thereafter, was kept wide up the backstretch entering the turn in about the five path before
angling in sharply to be two wide early on that bend, continued two to three wide till mid-stretch where he was guided out while failing to threaten. DUDE
GREELEY bumped the outside rival at the start then came in bumping the inside foe, chased from off the inside in the three to four path on the turn, was
tired in the lane. KINGDOM WAY was reluctant to load, exchanged a bump shortly after the start, trailed up the backstretch shifting to the rail entering the
turn, was taken in hand briefly near the three-eighths as a rival came in, swung four wide into the stretch and was never a threat.

LILLIE DELL broke well then crossed over while going to the front, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, responded well under a strong hand ride
in upper stretch, was put to the whip while extending the advantage outside the furlong marker, continued under the whip into the final sixteenth then was
placed back under a brisk hand ride while best. JIM'S BRONZE STAR chased the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, pursued the winner
under a drive in the stretch and narrowly held the place. SAIL ON ELLEN was reluctant to load then broke a step slow, settled on the outside, moved in near
the seven-sixteenths, was urged along while three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and finished with good energy to just miss the
place while clear for the show. CHICK BE QUICK moved out while settling under some urging, rounded the turn in the four path and failed to rally.
TACTFUL SUSAN hit the outside of the gate at the start then was bumped by SKY FACTOR and taken up briefly, settled at the rear, rounded the turn in the
two path, steadied behind horses inside the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive nearing the three-sixteenths and failed
to threaten. SKY FACTOR came out just after the start and bumped TACFUL SUSAN, angled in towards the rear, settled off the pace, saved ground on the
turn, bumped with MY HEART SINGS inside the five-sixteenths and came up empty. MY HEART SINGS was urged along off the pace while off the inside,
went around the turn in the two path, bumped with SKY FACTOR inside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and had nothing left.
STALEMATE was urged along on the outside, dropped back while lugging out six wide into the turn, moved to four then three wide later on that bend and

Footnotes
LOOKING FOR BULL moved out into the first turn, went around that bend in the two path, settled towards the back, slipped through on the inside of the spill
while in the two path into the far turn, angled four wide under urging at the five-sixteenths, rallied five wide into the stretch, dropped in approaching the
furlong marker, closed well into the final sixteenth and got up under steady urging. CONFEDERATE YELL was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths,
went five wide on the first turn, moved up on the outside midway down the backstretch, bumped with BAND BOSS while advancing leaving the backstretch,
chased in the four path on the far turn, made a bid in the six path into the stretch then took a short lead under a drive, brushed with JENNOVODKA into the
final furlong, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while able to get the place. JENNOVODKA went to the front, opened up a clear advantage in the two
path on the first turn, was asked while two then three wide on the far turn, floated five wide into the stretch under threat from CONFEDERATE YELL, was
headed shortly thereafter, brushed with the aforementioned foe while fighting on into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and was
outfinished but was clear for the show. MY CLASSIC BOWTIE went three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, bumped with foes on both sides
leaving the backstretch, chased in the two path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under the whip and tired. BAND BOSS broke in at the start, went
three wide on the first turn, settled towards the front, bumped with foes on both sides leaving the backstretch then checked, had MISS YOU JO clip his heels
at that point, went four wide on the far turn and lost all chance. MIKEY'S MOUSE dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, settled off the pace,
bumped with MY CLASSIC BOWTIE leaving the backstretch then steadied, was put to urging shortly thereafter, saved ground into the stretch and had
nothing left. OHMYMY OHMYYES went four wide on the first turn, settled near the back, struck the fallen foe while jumping over that rival at the
three-eighths then checked very sharply and was eased but walked off. JACOBS FLYER went five wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, collided hard
with the fallen foe at the three-eighths as that one began to regain his footing and fell, returned to his feet and went the wrong way for a about a quarter-mile
before being caught then was walked onto the horse ambulance and subsequently vanned off. MISS YOU JO went three wide on the first turn, settled on
the outside then was joined by CONFEDERATE YELL midway down the backstretch, clipped heels with BAND BOSS as that one checked at the
three-eighths then fell and was struck by two foes from behind before regaining his feet, went off the wrong way for about a quarter-mile before being caught
and was also walked on the horse ambulance then subsequently vanned off. Following a stewards' inquiry, CONFEDERATE YELL was disqualified from
second and placed sixth for interference at the three-eighths pole.
