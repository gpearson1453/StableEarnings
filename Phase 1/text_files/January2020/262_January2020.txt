Footnotes
LOFTY had speed three deep then outside the runner-up, inched away into the turn, opened up along the inside, kicked away again in the final furlong
under some urging to win clear. LETS GET WILD had speed off the rail then angled in, pressed then stalked the pace inside, came out a bit into the stretch
and was clearly second best. LUCKY BABE chased inside then off the rail on the turn, came out in midstretch and edged a rival late for the show. WHAT A
FAMILY settled outside a rival chasing the pace, angled to the fence on the turn, continued inside in the stretch and was edged for third. ROSE'S CRYSTAL
was slowly into stride, angled in and settled outside a rival then inside on the turn and into the stretch, came out in upper stretch and improved position.
SHENANDOAH STAR had speed between horses then stalked a bit off the rail to the stretch and weakened. JEMSEK a bit slow to begin, chased outside a
rival then just off the rail on the turn, continued alongside a foe into the stretch and also weakened. CI VOLEVA broke behind the field, angled to the inside,
came off the rail on the turn, angled out into the stretch and failed to menace. SLEW'S SCREEN STAR saved ground chasing the pace throughout and
weakened in the drive. BIG GAME PLAN a bit rough gaited when wide early, angled in outside a rival and had no response in the lane.

STACKIN SILVER had good early speed and set a pressured pace inside, edged away briefly into the second turn, fought back on that turn, inched away
again under left handed urging in the stretch, kicked clear, jumped tracks past the sixteenth pole and proved best. KNIFES EDGE between horses early,
pressed the pace outside the winner, bid again alongside that one on the second turn and into the stretch, could not match strides in the final furlong but
clearly bested the others. INCLUDE THE TAX four wide into the first turn, angled in and stalked just off the rail then tugged his way between horses on the
backstretch, stalked between foes on the second turn and just off the rail into the stretch and narrowly held third. GORKY PARK three deep into the first

Footnotes
CAPTAIN SCOTTY sped to the early lead, inched away on the backstretch and set the pace inside, continued along the rail in the stretch and held on
gamely under left handed urging. FLAGSTAFF hopped at the start, had speed between horses then stalked just off the rail, continued willingly alongside the
winner in deep stretch to just miss. SPEED PASS three deep early, stalked off the rail to the stretch, angled in some in the drive and lacked the needed
response. GRINNING TIGER broke a bit slowly, settled off the rail chasing the pace, fell back off the inside on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
K P ALL SYSTEMS GO bobbled slightly at the start, angled in and saved ground off the pace, came out leaving the second turn and five wide into the
stretch, rallied under brisk handling while drifting in to gain the advantage four wide in midstretch and drew off under steady handling and a hold late.
GOALIE saved ground stalking the pace, steadied briefly off heels nearing the stretch, bid between foes in midstretch and edged a rival for the place.
CAPITAL CALL broke a bit slowly, stalked inside, came out on the second turn and three deep into the stretch and was edged for second. FRASARD (GB)
had good early speed and dueled inside, inched away leaving the second turn, fought back along the rail in the stretch, was not a match for the winner in the
final furlong but gave ground grudgingly to the others. CANYON CREST settled outside a rival then off the rail, angled to the inside leaving the backstretch,
saved ground thereafter and bested the others. EDDY FOREVER three deep into the first turn, stalked outside a rival, went up three deep leaving the
second turn, bid outside the pacesetter into the stretch then between foes in midstretch and weakened in the final furlong. LEPRINO broke a bit slowly,
angled in and chased inside then off the rail on the backstretch, continued outside on the second turn and five wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. PORT
SAINT JOE had speed between horses then dueled outside a rival, stalked leaving the second turn, was in a bit tight between foes into the stretch and
weakened. HALLOWED GIFT broke a bit slowly, had speed four wide into the first turn, stalked outside then alongside a rival, went four wide leaving the
second turn and into the stretch and also weakened. VODKA TWIST angled in and chased outside a rival then a bit off the rail, was outside a foe again on
the second turn, fell back in the stretch, weakened and was eased late. FINISH CONFIRMED BY EQUIBASE.
