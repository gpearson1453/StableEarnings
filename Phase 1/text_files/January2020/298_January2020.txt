Footnotes
RIDOLFO established the top proceeding along the chute, cut over to the inside route, was coaxed along showing the way, tailed by a pair of opponents to
his outside, edged away from them during the run around the bend, got called upon for more in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, drew away prior to
getting geared down in the final seventy yards. DA BERG stalked the pacesetter from the two path, was let out a notch at the five-sixteenths pole, was soon
called upon for more spinning into the lane, got staved off, had no difficulty securing second. EL SANGRU sluggish on the chute, flashed interest at the first
fraction was being finalized, enough so as to become part of the pace picture, departed the backstretch stationed in the three path, was asked for more run
late on the turn, swung into stretch, lacked a response. FREUDIAN ANALYST remained along the inside route after being shouldered by the second place
finisher shortly after the start, checked hard when bothered by a pair of loose rivals early on the backstretch, loped along, cautiously ridden with those
rider-less foes close by but to his outside for six furlongs, went approximately three wide into the lane, went on to cross the finish line for the final significant
slice of the purse. TRY'N SMART'N UP sat reserved off the inside during the initial stages, shied in reacting to a suddenly-rogue PLEBE right around the top
of the backstretch, lost its rider after appearing to clip the heels of the aforementioned opponent, was walked off the track after being apprehended. PLEBE
forwardly placed after an apparent clean getaway, ducked in sharply approaching the location where the chute melds with the main course, got clipped from
behind by another after losing his pilot, was walked off the track after being apprehended. Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the incident on the
backstretch, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
STARTING POINT four wide in aim of the front, had the riderless horse come outwards and was bumped at the half mile pole, then got carried out into the
turn seven to eight paths by the three-eighths by that foe before being able to tuck in behind placed to urging nearing the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside for home heads apart for command, dug in taking command near the eighth pole, inched away gamely to the finish to prevail. TIZ MORNING five
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide at the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the three-eighths as the aforementioned foe was
carried out to the scenic route by the riderless animal, took over narrow command near the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch under threat,
dug in drifting in near the eighth pole and was headed for command, fought on to the finish well clear of the rest for the place honors. LEGION STORM
chased four wide until tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch
and weakened while along for the show honors. QUIET OUT EAST coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, got
placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. KADENS COURAGE established the front and showed the
way in hand two to three wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front near the five-sixteenths, faded, went three wide into upper stretch
and faltered. WILD WEEKEND stumbled at the start and lost the rider in the process, got apprehended by outrider after completing the course sans rider
and walked off under his own power. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the start before the result stood and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
TITAN'S WILL vied for control to the inside of ONESHOTFOREVER during the initial stages, was put to a firm hold and eased back, tipped into the two path
coming up to the half mile pole, stalked the leader lightly encouraged, picked up ground when switched over to stronger handling after crossing midpoint,
was put to a drive spinning into the lane on near even terms with the earlier-mentioned opponent, took charge during the ensuing furlong, then stayed
comfortably in the clear kept to the task at hand. MR. FIDGET chased the pace from path two after bumping with EYE'EM GONE at the start, angled four
wide into the lane, straightened away and rallied for the place. POLITICAL settled in midpack after the start, travelled three wide, the widest of all, on the
turn, got called upon for more at the five-sixteenths pole, fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch, becoming once again the widest of all, was
eventually along for the show. ONESHOTATFOREVER remained forwardly placed after the field had been sent off and running, raced on even terms
outside the winner before being given the advantage by that opponent after the first split had been posted, glided over to the rail at the top of the turn, saw
the top one begin to apply pressure soon afterwards out in path two, was challenged in earnest as they spun into the lane, put up a fight for another
sixteenth then backed away steadily. ALEPH underwent a ground-saving journey and faltered. EYE'M GONE made contact with MR FIDGET after coming
in at the break, took up residence along the inside route, was put to some urging well before arriving at the half mile pole, cut the corner into the lane and
tired. TUXEDO SUNDAY two wide onto the turn, was in the same path exiting it, failed to reach a contending position.

Footnotes
OVERBOLD coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper
stretch under threat and brushed with his main danger to the outside, dug in dueling through the length of the stretch and was headed for command a
furlong out, battled back along the inside to take over narrowly a sixteenth out, then came outwards late brushing his main rival twice while holding on.
INCLUNATION chased just off the inside from near the rear, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced through the latter portion of the far turn
to issue a challenge swinging three wide into upper stretch, got brushed at that juncture by the top one, dug in knocking heads through the length of the
stretch taking command a furlong out, got headed a sixteenth from home, then got brushed twice late and herded a bit as OVERBOLD came outwards in
the shadow of the wire. MY AMANJENA chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened.
TRUE BLUE GIANT four wide through the first turn, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide into the far turn, came
under coaxing three furlongs out, went six wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes. BRIDGETOTHEFUTURE coaxed from the start, raced three wide
through the first turn, chased four wide down the backstretch before tucking inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun just
off the inside for home and tired. FOTIS two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SIXTO secured a prominent position after the field had been sent off and running, was two to three wide in pursuit of the front runners on the bend, having
been put to a drive by the seven-sixteenths pole, swung out four wide stepping into the lane, chopped away at the deficit, struck the front with approximately
a sixteenth remaining and edged away. COUSIN ANDREW underwent a ground-saving journey, fell back on the turn without a visible excuse, sprang to life
displaying some momentum coming up to the quarter pole, cut the corner into the stretch, launched a very solid rail rally to garner the place. MR PHIL
pressed the issue from the two path before weakening in the last eighth. ITS A WRAP grabbed the early advantage, cut over to the rail by the conclusion of
the backstretch, was coaxed along carving out the pace, shifted into the two path when set down for the drive home, got collared in the general area of the
sixteenth pole and backed away. FEVOLA departed the backstretch from the three path, got sent out five wide from upper to midstretch, had no rally..

Footnotes
WHYISSHESOOLUCKY underwent a ground-saving journey, brought up the back of the pack all the way to the end of the bend, got cued up after cutting
the corner into the lane, gained room along the inside corridor after a pair of opponents, those being ELEGANT ROSE and WINIFRED J, moved over into
the two path during the first half of the stretch run, availed of the opportunity provided and kicked into stride travelling through the furlong grounds, struck the
front with approximately a sixteenth to go and drew clear. QUESTEQ stalked the pace towards the three path, got roused spinning into the lane, rallied with
some willingness to get up for the place. WINIFRED J established the top in short order, showed the way, spaced at a slight distance from off the rail, was
put to a drive for the drive home, inched her way into the two path, leaving the rail open by the eighth pole, got reeled in by the winner about a sixteenth
later, ventured onward and lost out on second. PEGGY SUE made some contact with the left side of the starting gate after lunging at the break, took up the
chase four wide on the turn, stepped about as wide into the lane, lacked the needed response with which to make an impact. SHESASUPERFREAK tracked
the leader while racing two wide on the turn, angled sharply into the five path heading for the three-sixteenths marker, made no headway. ELEGANT ROSE
guided over to the inside route shortly after the start, saved ground until the three-sixteenths pole, faltered after tipping into the two path at that station.

Footnotes
TIZ KAZ NOW hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, got set down spinning just off
the inside into upper stretch, drew off under a drive to prevail. CAUSE chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three
wide for home, proved no match for the top one, weakened in the late stages while able to preserve the place honors. CATZALIONBYTHETALE bobbled at
the break, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and improved position for the show
honors. IMPERIO D chased three then two wide, tucked inside put to coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. INSPECTOR
HENNING hard to load, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, cornered four wide for home and trailed.
