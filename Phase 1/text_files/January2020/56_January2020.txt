Footnotes
FIFTYSHADESOGRAYCE got away well, set a pressured pace while racing three across, drew off in the upper stretch for a clear lead, was under pressure
late and held under steady urging. B C Z MIDDLETON raced mid pack, went eight wide at the top of the stretch, closed under strong left handed urging and
was gaining late. SURF KITTEN pressed the pace while racing inside to the turn, fell back, hung late and held for show. SIERRITA lagged while racing
outside, went nine wide at the top of the stretch, offered a mild bid only and failed to menace. FOGGIA raced close to the pace, rallied four wide on the turn
to challenge, fell back and gave way. FIGHT TO GLORY pressed the pace while racing between horses, fell back on the turn and finished evenly.
BOOMERANG MISS broke slowly, went ten wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid. OPPENHEIMER was hustled along, flashed speed and dropped
back steadily.

S U M RACER was taken back from between horses along the backstretch, dropped in, closed along the rail, got up near the sixteenth pole, inched away
and was fully extended. TRAPPIZA led around the first turn, vied inside to the second turn, drew clear, led past the eighth pole and was outclosed in a good
effort. SHIMMERING DREAM was getting out on the first turn, rated back and raced inside, shifted out out on the second turn, bid six wide, hung and settled
for show. MISS SHAWHAN saved ground, was checked along the backstretch, angled out, bid seven wide and failed to rally. QUIET NO MORE was
unhurried early, raced far back, bid inside on the turn, lacked room, angled out and lacked a rally. WINNER'S DREAM moved up into the backstretch to vie
two across, was through after a half and gave way. HILDA was through after a half. EASTER DREAM in close between horses, stopped on the turn and was
not urged late. The rider of MISS SHAWHAN claimed foul against the rider of S U M RACER for alleged interference on the backstretch. No change was

Footnotes
READY TO FORGIVE dueled throughout and prevailed in a long drive. ROCKING CHIEFTAIN dueled throughout and was outnodded in a game effort. TOP
ROCKET pressed the pace while racing inside, fell back on the turn, continued in a steady effort and held safely for show. LICORICE DROP POPS was
never far back, put in a steady effort and failed to menace. MR WICKHAM pressed the pace, fell back into the turn, swung eight wide and leveled off in the
drive. SHANGHAI GO GO raced in close outside, swung ten wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid. DELUX PREMIER broke slowly and was
crowded at the start and improved position in an even effort. MAKERS WAY raced in the back, went thirteen wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid..
DANIEL RUN was not a factor. VIVID FEVER dueled early and stopped into the turn. RULING TOM dueled between horses and stopped into the turn.
