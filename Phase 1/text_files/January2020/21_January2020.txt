Footnotes
MCGLORIOUS was void of any early speed, saved ground into the home turn, found room in early stretch, took control at the eighth pole and held for the
win. TO SATISFY YOU was allowed to settle early, waited for room into the home turn, angled towards the inside, followed the winner, angled out in mid
stretch, was gaining late and just missed. SHORT POCKETS set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail throughout and weakened in late stretch. MOVIN
ON pressed the early pace, went five wide into the second turn and faded. PINK CADILLAC was unhurried early, raced between rivals and flattened out.
WEDDING DANCE tracked the early pace, went six wide into the second turn and was empty late.
