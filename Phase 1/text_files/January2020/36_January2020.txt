Footnotes
SOLAR MAXIMUS slow early fired outside of the quarter pole swinging seven wide at the head of the lane angling in dueling three deep late edging clear.
HERO OF HAVEN advanced to pressure on the backside taking a narrow lead on the far turn, digging in from the three path in upper stretch would cede
grudgingly to outside pressure. SAY HEY KID tracked the pace rallying to bid six wide in upper stretch being carried in while dueling between horses late.
VOW'S SON stalked the pace chasing on the far turn, went evenly the final eighth needing more. WAR AT SUNRISE slow early swung out at the eighth
pole ending up in the six path gaining modestly late. ISLAND VICE away alertly set a pressured pace dueling on the far turn gradually wearing down through
the lane. FLIGHT MISSION lost ground to the far turn tiring there. STAND ALONE DENNIS hustled along chased through the far turn then wilted in upper
stretch.

evenly moving up to loom outside the leader in upper stretch bearing down gamely on rival late. MISTER MOBIL slow early saved ground to upper stretch
finishing well on the inside. OLE WATASHI chased the pace extending four wide into upper stretch weakening late. GOES TOO FAST flashed early speed
then faded on the turn. MACADOOOO KID played no factor. CONGLOMERATOR was never involved. SLICK GRIT in close at the break would trail
