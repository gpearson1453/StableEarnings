YOU WANNA EAR RIP chased the leaders to the turn, remained on the rail to the stretch then had room inside of ONLY THE FACTS, rallied in the final
furlong and won driving. MISS GEORGIE GAL was outsprinted to t he turn, raced two wide to the stretch then finished willingly between rivals. ONLY THE
FACTS contested the pace from the rail to the stretch, came off the fence slightly in upper stretch, responded to deep stretch then was outfinished. HEART

stalked the pace to the turn, made a run three wide to the stretch but could not sustain that bid and finished evenly. BREAKING THE CODE dueled outside
of ONLY THE FACTS and two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened.

FANTASTIC ARAGORN was unhurried to the half, rallied two then three wide to the stretch, pushed to the front in mid stretch and edged clear under steady
urging. IRON ALEX was fractious in the gate then broke a bit slow, tracked the pace to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then finished
best of the others. ACROBAT pressed the pace to the second turn, bid two wide to the stretch, got oukicked to mid stretch and did not rally. NERVOUS
NELLIE set the pace for five furlongs, responded to the stretch then was overtaken in mid stretch and finished evenly. HAWK'S RISING had no speed,
lagged for six furlongs then also did not rally. CATS OUT TONITE was four wide on the first turn, settled to the half then saved ground to the stretch but
gave out after six furlongs.

ROB'S GOT GAME pressed the leader three wide to the stretch then pushed to the front nearing mid stretch and held driving. MONCEROS chased the
pace to the turn, was two wide to the stretch then finished willingly for second. CASH MONEY broke a bit slow, had no speed, was three wide to the stretch
and was making up ground belatedly. CAPTAIN WAY stalked the pace to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch, briefly loomed a threat in mid stretch but
finished evenly. DYNAMIC DUO had no speed, was fanned out four wide to the stretch and lacked the needed late response. KLAY NATION broke a bit
slow then was sent up to take the lead, set the pace two wide to the stretch but got outkicked to mid stretch and tired.

Footnotes
RETURRAY hesitated and broke about five lengths last, lagged to the turn, advanced three wide to the stretch, was forced off his path by GALLANT
WARREN at the three sixteenths but recovered and rallied to be along in time. GALLANT WARREN was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the
stretch then angled out sharply for room nearing the three sixteenths causing RETURRAY off his path and finished willingly for the place. GEM STATE
tracked the pace to the turn, saved ground to the stretch, rallied to be on terms for the lead in mid stretch but was weakening in the late stages. MISTER
MCLEAN also was tracking the leaders, raced two wide to the stretch, rallied to engage for the lead in mid stretch but was also giving way late. JAMASON
had no speed, saved ground to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. OUR EXPECTATION also hesitated at the break and was four or
five lengths behind the others, raced three then four wide to the stretch, got pushed off his path by the winner at the three sixteenths and finished evenly.
HE'S A HIT hustled to contest the pace outside WINK AND A DREAM, dueled two wide to the stretch, had the rider drop his whip at the three sixteenths
then tired in the final furlong. WINK AND A DREAM was pushed up to duel for the lead inside HE'S A HIT, responded to mid stretch then also tired.
CAPTAIN FURY was outsprinted to the turn, raced four wide to the stretch but was weakening late. HEAVENLY PURSUIT chased the pace three wide to
the stretch, got pushed out a bit by OUR EXCPECTATION at the three sixteenths and gave way. STARTLING was reluctant to load then had no speed,
bore out nine wide on the turn and stopped in the stretch.
