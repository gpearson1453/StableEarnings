Footnotes
BERN CIGARS broke outwards and soundly bumped a rival, but recovered and cleared in the early stages, stayed in the two path, widened his advantage
turning for home, then tired inside the final furlong, but had enough to hold on. NICE BANK stalked closest to BERN CIGARS while along the inside, angled
off the rail to the three path to be outside of that foe approaching the quarter pole, got outkicked by that rival turning for home, but commenced a grinding
rally as the leader tired inside the final furlong, but did not have enough. INALIENABLE RIGHTS raced along the inside in midpack before angling to the five
path to be outside of the leading group into the turn, shifted out further at the furlong marker, and offered a belated rally. SUNSHINE DANDY angled to the
rail while far off the pace setter into the turn, saved ground around the bend, then offered a mild rail rally for minor rewards without threatening. MENLO
PARK was reluctant to load, then was void of speed in the five path while racing with climbing action, then passed tired rivals in the six path through the lane
while hanging on his left lead. GET THE POINT took a hard bump from an inner rival at the start, stalked in the four path, but lacked a response after
coming under a drive at the five sixteenths pole. AMERICAN PRAISE stalked three wide in the four path, but weakened between horses at the quarter pole.
I GOT THE BRAHMS took a sound bump from an inner rival and in turn soundly bumped his outer rival at the start, then was outrun while in the four path
and between horses and failed to get involved. SARATOGA SHINER trailed throughout and showed little.

Footnotes
TWO WAY ROAD dueled four wide early on before forging clear from her inner foes and angling to the three path into the turn, was pressed by NATALIE
around the turn, but drew off in upper stretch and was driven to the wire. BORN TO WIN broke well but was outsprinted early on, gained ground around the
turn while between horses in the four path, achieved place at the furlong pole, and stayed on to be second best. NATALIE stalked the leading group from
the five path while close to the pace, made a bid in the four path into the turn and pressed the leader through the bend, but failed to keep pace with that foe
turning for home and weakened while hanging on her left lead through the lane. REINING IN threw her head in the gate and was restless right before the
gates opened, then hopped when they did and was off poorly, trailed the field in the three to four path, made a five wide gain outside of BORN TO WIN
around the turn, but flattened out approaching the quarter pole, then stayed on for a minor share while hanging on her left lead. SUNNY HILL BOBBIE raced
close to the pace inside of the leading trio, but failed to keep pace with that group into the turn, faded between horses to trail the field turning for home, then
passed tired rivals. JOYOFTHIRTYSEVEN vied three wide between horses early on, but failed to keep pace with TWO WAY ROAD while pulling right
around the turn, then faded through the lane. SEMAYA dueled between horses while two wide, but failed to keep pace with TWO WAY ROAD into the turn
and weakened.

SO GUCCI ducked out leaving the gate, quickly advanced outside to gain command midway on the backstretch, drew out leaving the backstretch, stayed
well out from the rail around the turn and widened under a brisk hand ride. TAKE ME HOME wasn't far back along the rail early, fell back on the turn then
proved second best while weakening. MISTRESS AT SEA sped to a clear lead at once, made the early pace while racing out from the inside then stopped
in the lane. IVANYA broke slowly, stayed inside and never factored. BIG BAD RED was outrun two wide.

Footnotes
HELLO'NDUBAI dueled along the inside, forged clear approaching the five sixteenth pole, drew off while shifting to the three path turning for home, then
held sway while hanging on his left lead through the lane. BROAD STREET BULLY leaned inwards and brushed the gate when they opened, then rushed to
prompt the pace three wide, failed to keep pace with HELLO'NDUBAI turning for home, but kept on through the lane to secure place. WHERE YOU WAS
stalked along the inside and pulled his way to the pocket passing the half mile pole, remained under a tight hold into the turn, but lacked a kick through the
lane. ROANIE was outsprinted early on and trailed the field, saved ground around the turn and offered a mild belated rally along the inside through the lane
without threatening. KNOCKTURN ALLEY dueled two wide early on, but failed to keep pace at the five sixteenths pole and weakened between horses.
GADAGO raced off the pace in the three path and failed to get involved.

COLOR FORCE steadied when brushed while trying to rally two wide between rivals into the turn, moved to the front soon after, drew clear after a half and
was kept to brisk urging. IL MIO AMORE advanced early along the rail while inside the winner, bore out into that one approaching the turn, remained
prominent to the quarter pole then tired. LUNA DE FUEGO was close up outside early, was bumped while moving four wide into the turn then stopped in the
lane. BUTTON CANDY opened a clear lead soon after the break, bore out into LUNA DE FUEGO while three wide between rivals into the turn, stopped and
was eased up late. REYANA REYA DREAMS couldn't catch up.

Footnotes
SMART TWO A T established a clear lead into the first turn, widened his advantage in hand passing the half mile pole, built an insurmountable lead around
the far turn, and won easily without ever being asked for his best run. HASTA AHORA rallied four wide around the far turn to achieve place in upper stretch,
but was no threat to the winner. DUNK A DIN rallied five wide around the far turn to bid for place at the quarter pole, but failed to keep pace with HASTA
AHORA for that place in upper stretch, and kept on for show. CLINIC gained ground by saving it around the far turn, but got outfinished for minor rewards.
DEFINITELY TONIGHT broke inwards, was outrun while staying in the four path around both turns, trailed into the lane, then passed tired rivals. TINTO
MESA was outrun, stayed in the two path, and passed tired rivals in the lane. PARAUARI (FR) stalked in the two path while rank through the first turn, but
failed to keep pace with the leader down the backstretch, held place around the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch. HANGTIME saved ground from
midpack, but weakened around the far turn. SWITCHBLADE stalked in the three path, but weakened into the far turn and subsequently stopped.
