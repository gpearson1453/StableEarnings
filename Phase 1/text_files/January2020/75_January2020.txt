JUNE TWO FOUR stalked the pace, was roused on the turn, got a head in front near the eighth pole, drew off and was ridden out. BAY AREA raced close
to the pace outside, went eight wide at the top of the stretch, closed well to earn place and was no match for the winner. SPIRIT MISSION raced close to the
pace between horses, dropped back entering the turn, closed under left handed urging and earned show. FATS DOMINUS broke in the air, was sent to the
front to set the pace, drew clear on the turn, was headed mid stretch and faltered. FREDDIES DREAM was unhurried early, trailed the field, went ten wide at
the top of the stretch and offered a mild bid only. COLONEL GOTHAM stalked the pace while racing inside, tired into the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
BLUEBERRY PRINCESS rallied three across on the turn, dueled through the stretch and inched away late to prove best. CALM DOWN LADY broke
awkwardly while getting away well, set the pace, responded to duel and yielded late to finish second best. MISS BOISTEROUS was crowded and bumped
at the start, raced close to the pace and lacked the needed late response. BLUEGRASS BETTY pressed the pace to the turn, fell back and finished evenly.
IRISH SUNRISE was reluctant to load, bumped at the start and passed tiring rivals in a wide trip. END ZONE EMBRACE raced inside, angled out on the
turn, bid eight wide and failed to be a threat. MCFUN broke in and showed brief speed only.

CHAMPSACHAMP raced in close, went five wide leaving the turn, went willingly to the wire and couldn't gain ground. TIZ MEOW bid between horses on the
turn, lacked room through the stretch and earned show in a game effort. DUDLEY STUDLEY bumped at the start, raced between horses to the turn, dueled
past the eighth pole and was unable to sustain his bid. JOHN PAUL'S BET raced inside, put in a steady effort and didn't have enough late. ALPINE LUCK
dueled inside to the turn and gave way. CYCLONE DAN raced in the back, bid six wide and came up empty. SPYDEE broke awkwardly to be away slowly,
trailed the field and went wide in the drive.

Footnotes
LOOKOUT TAYLOR was unhurried early, advanced to the turn, went six wide entering the stretch, closed steadily, wore down her rivals and drew clear late.
LA MER drew clear on the turn, drifted out late under left handed urging and yielded grudgingly to finish second best. JADEY AT THE BAR broke out, led
early, fell back into the turn, came again inside to threaten, came up empty late and settled for show. DANCING AWESOME stumbled at the start, pressed
the pace while racing outside, challenged for the lead on the turn and gave way. JERRYS WAY pressed the pace while racing outside, challenged between
horses on the turn and gave way. SHE LOOKS PROUD reared at the start to be away very slowly, raced in the back and went widest in the drive.
UNBRIDLED STORMY bobbled at the start, saved ground and was through after a half. ALOHA SPIRIT was through after a half. The stewards' posted an
inquiry concerning the start. No change was made.

THIN LINE dueled for the lead, drew off into the turn for a clear lead and held safely while ridden out. AT TWILIGHT TIME was unhurried early, advanced
around the turn, bid ten wide and got up for place while no threat to the winner. TRIPLE DOUBLE ZERO stalked the pace, bid seven wide, lacked a rally
and was caught for second. SAVAGE WARRIOR was never far back and failed to threaten in an even effort. LOOK AT MY STAR bumped at the start and
outrun in a wide trip. ARIZONA RY saved ground and was outrun in an even effort. SINK THE BISMARCK dueled for the lead, tired into the second turn and
dropped back steadily. PAPA JOE was not a factor. SPITTIN HAVOC broke out and bumped at the start and failed to contend.

Footnotes
SHARP HOLIDAY pressed the pace, angled out on the turn, bid eight wide, closed willingly and got up at the wire. SLEIGH RIDE pressed the pace,
challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled past the sixteenth pole, inched away and was caught to just miss. SHADY LANE got away alertly, dueled past
the sixteenth pole, was unable to sustain her bid and held for show. TIZ THE STORM was never far back, swung wide entering the stretch, bid and didn't
have enough late. BOLT UP pressed the pace, was steadied on the turn and dropped back. FLASHY GOLD dropped back quickly, bid inside and improved
position. I'M NOT FANCY dueled inside and gave way into the turn. OUR SWEET LEGACY was not a factor.
