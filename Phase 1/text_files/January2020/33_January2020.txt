Footnotes
HEAT THINGS UP bumped with at the start, pressed between rivals, dueled with NAHOY and assumed command, drifted out entering the stretch and
proved best under a drive to the line. NAHOY set the pace three deep off the fence, dueled around the turn and was floated out by HEAT THINGS UP into
the stretch, fought back from the outside but could not summon the needed final kick to get by. BAJA WARRIOR bumped in the beginning, chased from the
inside, stalked along the rail to the stretch and never offered the needed response. CANADIAN WARRIOR lacked early speed, a bit off the rail into the turn,
angled out on the turn and into the stretch and passed a tired foe. DEVILS GAME pressed four deep up the backstretch then moved inward to chased
outside a rival, raced off the rail into the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
SIX EIGHTEEN set the pace up the backstretch, angled to the inside, felt slight pressure from CURRYFORTHREE BANG but quickly kicked clear of that
rival, inched away into the stretch and held safely under right-handed urging. CURRYFORTHREE BANG chased off the rail, made a mild bid outside the
leader but lost contact again around the turn, entered the stretch three wide and held the place. SIENNA outside a rival to the turn, three to four wide leaving
the bend, drifted in past the sixteenth pole and got up for the show. CAT'S DESSERT stalked from the inside to the lane and weakened. DERBY ROYALTY
chased two wide into the turn, moved out into the three path, showed a mild response and was in tight between runners in the final strides. UNCHANGED
raced off the rail and lacked early speed, angled in on the turn and failed to rally.

HOLIDAYINCAMBODIA chased the AMERICAN HEART early, moved closer and gained command, cleared foe and drew off around the turn, then held
safely in the late stages. ANA LISA tracked off the rail, angled inside of MY PROJECT GIRL, traveled two wide then angled over to the inside, cut the corner
into the stretch and outkicked AMERICAN HEART for the place honors. AMERICAN HEART sped clear of the field early, lost the lead nearing the turn,
chased from the inside then two wide into the stretch and was outfinished for second. MADAME MOUSSE threw head and was off slow to begin, advanced
from the outside to the turn, came four wide into the stretch and finished willingly. FOREST WILDFLOWER stalked outside a rival up the backstretch, went
three wide around the turn and lacked a rally. SLIGHTLY chased from the inside then tried to get out and fought the rider on the backstretch, dropped to the
back of the field, chased a bit off the rail into the lane and finished out with some late interest after earlier trouble. MY PROJECT GIRL chased off the rail,
between rivals into the turn, angled to the inside and weakened.

JUSTAMITCH set pace, angled in, cleared turn, hand urging. SOKUDO bumped start, checked early, 2wide, rallied. CHRISISCOOKIN stalked, 3wide into
stretch, evenly. EL KOREANO bumped both sides, steadied early, inside, angled out stretch. LOVE YOUR LIFE bumped start, steadied early, 2wide, no
factor. RON'S CAT broke in, bumped start, came in early, pressed, inside, tired. There was double rider's objection against the winner JUSTAMITCH
alleging interference early in the race. After a Steward's review, they placed no blame on JUSTAMITCH but instead ruled that RON'S CAT caused the
interference and since she finished last there would be no change.
