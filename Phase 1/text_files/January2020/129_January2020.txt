Footnotes
NEVADAN set a pressured pace, drew off on the turn and extended his lead while kept to task. ASSETS INCLUDED stalked the pace, went seven wide
entering the stretch, lacked a rally and was no match for the winner. HAT IN THE RING broke slowly, was crowded and steadied at the start, trailed the field
and closed well to get up for show. DAPIRATE went nine wide at the top of the stretch, offered a mild bid only and did not threaten. CHELOKEE'S LEGACY
was not a factor. AWESOME IMAGE led early, bore out, fell back on the turn and steadily faded from contention. OVER EZ raced mid pack, swung nine
wide entering the stretch and gave way. NEVER GIVE IN broke slowly, was boxed in to the turn, angled out and stopped.

Footnotes
SINDY'S REVENGE was never far back, swung nine wide leaving the turn, closed steadily, wore down her rivals, got up late and won going away. UH OH
LUCY raced close to the pace, bid willingly to contend, was no match late and finished second best. RIVER JUMPER set the pace, faltered near the
sixteenth pole and held safely for show. GRAND ENGAGEMENT raced mid pack in an even effort and failed to menace. CURLIN TO COLOR was off
slowly, raced far back and improved position under mild urging. PARIS AT NIGHT was hustled along, showed speed to the turn and stopped. TALK ABOUT
BIANCA raced inside and was not a threat. SMOKED PAPRIKA saved ground, showed speed to the turn and gave way. SOULFUL STRUT showed little.

SOUND LOGIC set the pace, swung wide leaving the turn, drifted out in the drive and held well. WED O'S CHAMP raced in close, was rated back, closed
steadily, couldn't gain and finished second best. RESPECT THE BOSS broke awkwardly, was carried seven wide entering the stretch and lacked a late
response. MAE BELLE PASSE was void of early speed, saved ground, shifted out for the drive and offered a mild bid only. NOVA SCOTIA raced close to
the pace, swung wide leaving the turn, leveled off and faded. TOO AWESOME raced mid pack, bid inside, came up empty, was eased late and walked off.
SHAYMIN raced in the back, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a response. PRIMARY HEART was pulled up and vanned off.

Footnotes
MY CRAFTY GAL set the pace, drew off on the second turn, veered in at the gap and was ridden out. DEPUTY DORA saved ground, angled out on the
turn, closed steadily and earned place while no match for the winner. YES PLEASE raced close to the pace, went five wide entering the stretch, hung late
and settled for show. ATHENA THE GODDESS raced close to the pace inside, was checked on the second turn, leveled off and faded. MCKENZIE HONEY
stalked the pace to the second turn and flattened out. INDIAN BELLA was unhurried early, went six wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid. STAR
SUNDAE was steadied entering the first turn and did not threaten in an even effort. YANKEE PRIDE was not a factor. PEACH TIME trailed the field. The
rider of ATHENA THE GODDESS claimed foul against the rider of YES PLEASE for alleged interference on the turn. No change was made. Hand timed.
