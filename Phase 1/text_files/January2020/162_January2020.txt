Footnotes
TALIA LADYBUG quickly went clear and set a rated pace, raced two wide into the lane, responded to the left stick and turned back a challenge to her
inside, edged back away in the final furlong and won under a drive. DEIRDRE OF LEGEND saved ground, took closer order past the five sixteenths, loomed
a threat soon into the lane, failed to match strides past the three sixteenths, shifted out leaving mid stretch and continued willingly while holding down the
place. AWESOME PAL was steadied at the break, regrouped and edged up nearing the turn, angled out and circled four to five wide, made a run in mid
stretch and churned on willingly. MEET MICHELLE chased the pace, raced inside in the drive and failed to menace. TIZ INCLUDED dropped off the pace
while saving ground, angled out in the lane but failed to menace. RAPIDASHQUEEN rushed up early, stalked three wide outside the winner, made a mild
bid mid turn, pursued into the lane then gave way.

SAVANNAH ROXANNA sped to the front, set a rated pace towards the rail, turned away a challenge near the quarter pole, kicked away under left handed
rousing in mid stretch and held firm while under steady hand pressure the final seventy yards. MAJESTIC PIC edged up between rivals nearing the half mile
marker, steadied soon after and dropped back to last, angled to the rail for the drive, got through past mid stretch and closed willingly to garner the place.
SLEWZER forced the early pace three wide, raced two wide mid turn, shifted out four wide entering the lane, moved up past mid stretch and kept trying to
the line. BARBSGRAY LION rated close up while saving ground, eased back a couple lengths leaving the far turn, came off the rail in the drive then went
evenly in the final yards. SPLENDOR GAL broke awkwardly, recovered and advanced four wide nearing the turn, bid outside the winner nearing the quarter
pole, failed to kick on in mid stretch and faded. GREASEDLIGHTNING forced the early pace outside the winner and dropped back. FLIRTATION WALK
stumbled badly at the break and lost her rider. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start. No action was taken.

Footnotes
CONGRESS HALL , bumped and forced in by SMART ENTRY leaving the starting gate, saved ground stalking the pace, found room along the rail to take
the lead inside the quarter pole and lasted under energetic urging. CAROUSEL MARGE , two wide leaving the turn, angled out in upper stretch and rallied
between horses. COLD HEARTED GAL circled the turn three deep, drifted to the five path in upper stretch and flattened out. SMART ENTRY bumped the
winner when bearing in leaving the starting gate, steadied behind horses mid way down the backstretch, raced along the inner rail in the stretch and passed
tired horses late. MY LILA set the pace near the rail, drifted out in upper stretch and gave way. GRAND ENTRADA , no factor, raced wide on the turn.
CLOCKWISE prompted the pace outside MY LILA and gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
JUSTWAVEANDSMILE rated close up between rivals, awaited room near the quarter pole, angled out and bumped with LYNARD soon into the lane, found
a seam past the three sixteenths, closed in under right handed rousing, forged to command approaching the sixteenth marker, kicked clear then held sway
under steady handling. TOY settled off the pace while saving ground, eased out and moved up behind rivals nearing the quarter pole, swung seven wide
into the lane, straightened and closed well to gain. DESHACKLED set a pressured pace towards the rail, was guide to two wide into the lane, shook clear
past the three sixteenths, failed to contain the winner heading to the sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly. PLOT THE DOTS lost ground four wide
while off the early pace, commenced a run past the three eighths, circle rivals then shifted six wide into the lane, continued progress past the furlong
grounds then flattened out late. LORD TIZ saved ground throughout, chased and kept on with effort. CHARM CITY BAND pressed the pace outside
DESHACKLED, fought on between foes into the lane then weakened in the final eighth. MAXIMUS MIDANI lacked speed, dropped further back leaving the
far turn, raced three wide into the lane, angled out late and had some slight interest. LYNARD , brushed at the break, angled out and moved up nearing the
turn, bid three to four wide, pressed the issue into the lane, bumped with a rival then gave way.

STORMING MY WAY , three to four wide stalking outside, closed in under solid handling past the furlong grounds, wore down STROLL SMOKIN to take
command in deep stretch then was fully extended between rivals to prevail. DIVINE INTERVENTIO , off the pace and off the rail, moved up to the inside of a
rival past the five sixteenths, swung out and closed strongly through the final seventy yards. STROLL SMOKIN was sent to the front, set the pace pace
towards the rail and handled outside pressure, move away while drifting off the inside and under a drive, was confronted past the sixteenth pole and gave
way grudgingly. SIR ORINOCO rated forwardly while saving ground, steadied nearing the turn, regrouped and was taken to rate, advanced along the inside
nearing mid stretch, threatened inside rivals in deep stretch but was out finished. FIX ME A SANDWICH pressed the pace outside STROLL SMOKIN, failed
to kick on past the three sixteenths and weakened. WINPLACEORSHOWONO , between rivals nearing the half mile marker, lost ground four to five wide
past the five sixteenths and faded.
