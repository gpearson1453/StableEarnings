BOOMERANG MISS set a pressured pace, was under steady urging late and held on gamely. GAZING raced close to the pace, rallied on the turn, went
willingly to the wire, couldn't gain on the winner and settled for place. BEAU ROCKS bumped at the start, raced close to the pace inside, bid willingly to loom
a threat, didn't have enough late and was safe for show. DIANKA bumped and was crowded at the start, was unhurried early and raced inside, shifted out
on the turn and lacked the needed late response. KARSAVINA was fractious in the gate, raced in the back, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and
lacked a bid. CELESTIAL LIGHT trailed under mild urging and failed to contend. THE CRAIC pulled up and was vanned off.

XYLINA'S ART bumped at the start, set a pressured pace to the turn, drew clear and extended her lead under mild urging. TAKE CHARGE GWEN broke
awkwardly and bumped at the start, held a good position inside, closed steadily, was no match late and got up for place. SMOKED PAPRIKA was hustled
along to press the pace, lacked the needed late response and held safely for show. LADY JADE veered in a the start to be away slowly and improved
position in a steady effort. ZIBO got away alertly, showed speed to the turn, swung wide and gave way. LOVEUTHREETHOUSAND was checked at the
start, raced far back early and did not threaten. FRIED ONIONS showed little. FEATHER BOA failed to contend.

Footnotes
JAQUET got away well, stalked the pace while racing outside, challenged on the turn, dueled for the lead and proved best. THE METAL MAN saved
ground, got through along the rail on the turn, dueled for the lead and was outfinished in a game effort. WAKE UP CALL raced close to the pace, lacked the
needed late response and held safely for show. LOTSA LOOT set the pace, responded when challenged to duel and faltered past the eighth pole to lose
position. L D' RADO GOLDRUSH raced in the back and improved position in a steady effort. TOP HAT TITAN showed speed to the turn, fell back and
finished evenly. DIIACHI broke slowly and failed to menace in an even effort. TOP OF THE ROCK was not a factor. TEST THE WATER pressed the pace,
was taken in hand on the turn, swung out and dropped back. BESS EVER was reluctant to load and trailed the field.

TIZ MEOW stalked the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn and drew off past the eighth pole under urging. CHAMPSACHAMP was crowded at the
start, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and finished well to get up for place. HURRICANE FORCE pressed the pace, assumed command on the turn,
faltered past the eighth pole and was caught for second. RAOFTHESUN stumbled at the start, angled out at the top of the stretch, bid seven wide and failed
to menace. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE was void of early speed, bid inside on the turn and didn't have enough left. BULLET EXPRESS bumped at the start,
set a pressured pace to the turn and gave way past the eighth pole. SPOON BOSS broke in and bumped at the start, was never far back and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
GIO'S CALLING vied between horses early, fell back to stalk the pace, rallied three across on the second turn, got a head in front near the eighth pole,
came in near the sixteenth pole, drew away for a clear lead and held off the late charge of SURPRSINGLYPERFECT. SURPRSINGLYPERFECT was
unhurried early, raced in the back, advanced to the turn, bid five wide, found his best stride late and was gaining ground. SKYCHIEF vied inside, drew clear
entering the stretch, was crowded near the sixteenth pole, broke stride, fell back and held for show. PACIFIC NIGHTS was void of early speed, rallied
around the turn, bid nine wide and finished well. BOURBON N LIME was never far back, bid inside on the turn and hung late. C C EXPRESS raced in the
middle of the pack, bid inside on the turn and lacked the needed rally. EMPIRE KNIGHT pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, weakened
and faded through the stretch. TEDDY TIME was outrun in an even effort. WHY FRANK raced mid pack in an even effort and was outrun. SAXON LORD
raced three across to the first turn, set the pace to the second turn, flattened out and faded. TEMPLE KEYS was not a factor.
