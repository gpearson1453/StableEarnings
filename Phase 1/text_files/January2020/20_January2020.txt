ROOKIE MISTAKE dueled three deep, took the advantage on the turn, inched away and angled in just off the rail into the stretch, drew clear under urging
then steady handling late. COALINGA ROAD had good early speed and dueled inside, fought back midway on the turn, was not a match for the winner in
the drive but clearly second best. AUSTIN'S BOY broke a bit slowly, saved ground stalking the pace, came out leaving the turn and three wide into the
stretch and bested the others. LUVLUV three deep early, chased off the rail then angled to the inside leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and
into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. EL DIABLO ROJO broke a bit slowly, was between horses early, settled outside a rival chasing the pace to the
stretch and lacked the necessary response. BIG BILLY stalked outside a rival then a bit off the rail, went outside a foe on the turn and three deep into the
stretch and weakened. WORLD O LUCK broke a bit slowly, angled in and stalked inside, cut the corner into the stretch and also weakened. GEORGE
HERMAN RUTH dwelt then hopped to be away behind the field, settled just off the rail, came out into the stretch and did not rally. BERNIE'S BIG BOY had
good early speed and dueled between horses, fought back midway on the turn and weakened in the stretch.

BUYBACK stalked three deep between horses then a bit off the rail on the turn, bid outside the runner-up to gain the lead in the stretch and won clear under
urging. SUEZAAANA sped to the early lead, set the pace a bit off the rail then inside, came a bit off the fence again in the stretch and just held second.
INFO'S TREASURE dropped back off the rail then inside, angled in on the turn, came out into the stretch, went around a rival in midstretch then finished
with interest inside to be edged for the place. KATSAROS stalked four wide on the backstretch and three deep on the turn, came four wide into the stretch
and lacked a rally. MANRESA chased outside a rival, came out into the stretch, drifted in and split rivals under some urging then had the rider lose the whip
a sixteenth out and could not offer the necessary response. CHIRP stalked between horses then a bit off the rail on the turn and outside a rival into the
stretch and weakened. OSTERIA saved ground stalking the pace, came a bit off the rail in the stretch and also weakened. VIDALIA broke a bit slowly,
steadied between horses early, saved ground chasing the pace and also weakened. ROOT BEER RAG also broke a bit slowly, settled off the rail, came four
wide into the stretch and was not a threat.
