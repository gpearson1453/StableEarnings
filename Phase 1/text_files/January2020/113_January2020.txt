Footnotes
MAINFRAME JUDY went up inside to press then stalk the leader, came a bit off the rail into the turn, angled out a bit and rallied under left handed urging to
collar the runner-up in deep stretch. YOU'RERIGHT AGAIN had speed outside rivals then angled in alongside the winner, inched away on the backstretch
and angled in, set the pace inside, came a bit off the rail into the stretch, drifted in some in the final furlong and could not hold off the winner. VASTLY DEEP
three deep early, chased off the rail then outside a rival early on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and edged a foe for third. BALTIMORE BEECHO
broke in a bit, stalked outside a rival then off the rail, came three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally but was edged for the show. BEYOND
PRECHER dropped back and settled off the inside, angled in some on the turn, came out in the stretch and lacked a further response.

Footnotes
WIN OFTEN stalked off the rail then outside a rival on the turn, came out four wide into the stretch, gained the lead nearing midstretch, inched clear under
urging and held. FRENCH ROSE angled in and saved ground chasing the pace, came out into the stretch and again in upper stretch, was three deep in
midstretch and edged a rival for the place. MANDY had speed three deep then stalked off the rail, came three wide into the stretch, split horses in
midstretch and was edged for second. KRISTI'S TIGER a bit slow to begin, settled off the rail then a bit off the fence, went around a rival in midstretch and
another in deep stretch and continued inside late. WHITE VELVET also broke a bit slowly, chased outside then off the rail on the turn, came three deep into
the stretch, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. MISS KITNESS a step slow to begin, had speed between horses then dueled outside a
rival, was between foes in upper stretch, drifted in late and weakened. WAY TOO SWEET went up inside to duel for the lead, put a head in front on the turn,
fought back leaving the turn and into the stretch and had little left for the final furlong.

JOLIE OLIMPICA (BRZ) bobbled slightly at the start, stalked just off the rail then outside a rival on the turn, bid alongside the pacesetter under a couple taps
on the shoulder with the whip turned down past the eighth pole, took the lead just inside the sixteenth marker and proved best under a moderate hand ride.
KENTAN ROAD sped to the early lead, inched away and set the pace inside, fought back along the rail past midstretch, could not match the winner late but
was clearly second best. STORM THE HILL broke a bit slowly, went up inside and saved ground stalking the pace, continued along the rail on the turn and
in the stretch and held third. AN EDDIE SURPRISE stalked a bit off the rail then between horses on the backstretch and into the turn, continued just off the
inside leaving the turn and into the stretch and lacked a rally. FREE COVER stalked outside then three deep on the backstretch, dropped back off the rail
leaving the turn, angled in some nearing the stretch and weakened.
