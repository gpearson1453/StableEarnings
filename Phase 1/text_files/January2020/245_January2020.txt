Footnotes
OVER GATORS broke sharply, sped clear racing a bit off the rail through the backstretch, held sway on a comfortable advantage into upper stretch and was
kept to steady right handed pressure. COURAGEOUS CAJUN tracked the pacesetter inside a rival in the opening stages, conceded some position to those
foes nearing the turn but continued with a steady effort inside foes to edge a rival for second in the closing stages. I LOVE SHOPPING was rated off the
second flight while angling inwards a bit, gained position between foes racing into the stretch and was just outkicked for the place honors. DEMANDING,
unhurried near the inside in early stages, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued evenly. AJ'SLITTLEDANCER swerved a bit in the
opening stages, was settled near the inside and failed to menace thereafter. BYE BYE NICKY gained a forward placing tracking the pacesetter outside a
rival, was urged pursuing the pacesetter into the turn to briefly close the gap, then gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
AWESOME ROMEO tracked the pacesetter four wide in the second flight racing through the backstretch, shifted inwards a bit leaving the turn while making
steady progress to close the gap on the leaders and wore down RARE HUE in time to narrowly prevail under stout left handed pressure. The latter led the
second flight between foes tracking the pacesetter through the backstretch, was urged through the turn to challenge the leader nearing upper stretch,
gained a clear advantage between calls late but just missed. JUST SHOOT ALREADY sped to the lead just off the inside on his own courage, dictated the
pace into the turn to upper stretch but weakened once headed leaving the furlong marker. MY COMPUTER, caught in close quarters at the start while
shifting inwards brushing READY TO MINGLE, was collected to track off the second flight outside foes, shifted four wide racing into upper stretch and
continued with an effort to improve position. BOLTER tracked inside rivals as part of the second flight, saved ground to the lane but steadily faded in the
drive. READY TO MINGLE, brushed at the start, settled between foes in the last flight early, angled out five wide racing into the stretch but made no
impression. DELIVERED BY AKISS settled along the inside early and failed to menace. ERIN GO BRAUGH tracked the pace three wide between foes in
the opening stages, was prompted to advance nearing the turn but emptied out midway through the bend.

Footnotes
MR JOSHUA sped to the lead while angling inwards a bit to dictate the pace racing a bit off the rail in the opening quarter, was prompted to widen the
margin leaving the midway point of the turn, then came under firm right handed pressure racing through the stretch to maintain the advantage. REEDER,
forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening stages, lost some ground to that foe racing through the turn, was roused to challenge the
leader nearing midstretch but proved only second best. HEBGONE tracked the pacesetter inside foes in the second flight racing to the turn, saved ground to
upper stretch and finished evenly late. SEVENTYSEVENWILOW tracked the leaders four wide in second flight in the opening quarter, shifted inwards a bit
racing into the turn while being prompted to advance but continued evenly into the lane. FORTY FATHOMS tracked the leaders three wide between foes
through the backstretch, shifted out four wide entering the turn but lacked a closing bid. VALUE VOUCHER tracked the leaders between foes in second
flight to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. THE GREAT LOUDINI, off a step slowly, raced six wide into the turn, then to upper stretch and proved
no threat. K P CREED broke awkwardly while brushing the gate, shifted out five wide racing into the turn while being urged to regain some position but was
never a serious threat.

CHARGING RENEE broke readily to gain terms with a rival attending the pace under light reserve, continued under patient handling in that fashion through
the turn, then edged forward when given her cue nearing midstretch and widened the advantage late under firm right handed pressure. SAMMY'S TOWN,
urged to dispute the pace from the outset while shifting nearer to the inside foe, dueled for command on the turn into upper stretch but proved no match in
the closing stages. CANDY FOR ALL, off a bit slowly, angled to the inside while tracking off the second flight but steadily improved her position inside foes
racing into the stretch while no threat to the top pair. VUYELWA settled between foes in the last flight racing to the turn and passed inside some tiring rivals
late. V K LEGACY shifted out three deep early tracking just off the leaders racing to the turn but steadily faded nearing the lane. MARCHENWALD tracked
off the first flight four wide in the opening stages but gave way nearing upper stretch. EVERYWHEREILOOK tracked off the second flight outside foes in the
opening quarter but dropped out early. LIL SALTY broke slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
FACTION CAT was urged along the inside disputing the pace inside a rival racing into the turn, shook clear racing into upper stretch and held sway on a
widening margin under firm hand urging and a right handed tap. BACKTOHISROOTS angled inwards to track just off the leaders outside a rival racuing to
the turn, was prompted to advance while being carried out four wide racing into upper stretch but continued with a steady effort to secure the place honors.
CUESTION DE TIEMPO worked his way to the inside tracking just off the leaders racing into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch while being prompted
to advance inside foes but was outkicked for second. MY BOY LENNY angled to the inside early while dropping well off the second flight, saved ground to
the lane but never seriously menaced. PEMAQUID PETE broke sharply, angled in to force the pace outside the eventual winner racing into the turn, drifted
out leaving the quarter mile marker while carrying out a rival and quickly gave way. DEVILEYE settled in hand while dropping well off the field and trailed
throughout.

LENA HORNE showed quickly in front, angled to the rail dictating the pace on a narrow margin racing into the turn, forged clear racing into upper stretch
and widened the advantage under firm left handed encouragement. LOLANITA, reserved while shifting well off the inside in the opening stages, angled to
the rail racing through the turn while being prompted to advance and continued with a steady late bid to edge a rival for the place honors at the wire.
BUYWON GETWON tracked just off the pacesetter three deep between foes racing to the turn, was urged to advance in that path racing into upper stretch
to lodge a bid but flattened out in the final furlong. CASEYOUDIDN'TKNOW tracked the pacesetter four wide as part of the second flight in the opening
stages, was prompted to advance in tandem with several rivals racing into the turn but steadily faded after a half. SWINDLE shifted just off the inside while
being urged between foes to prompt the pacesetter into the turn and emptied out racing into upper stretch. JOPHIEL, restless prior to the start, angled to the
rail but dropped out early.

DARLINDIVA, bumped at the start while forced into LIL'S TURN, was urged to the fore along the rail racing into the first turn, conceded the lead entering
that bend while switching off the inside, tracked the pacesetter under light reserve to the second bend, steadily moved to terms with that foe to challenge for
command on the far turn, edged forward racing into upper stretch and maintained a narrow advantage to the end under firm handling. WEST HORIZEN
tracked the leaders along the inside racing to the backstretch, advanced on those foes on the far turn while shifting out nearing upper stretch, then
continued willingly three deep in the closing stages while just failing to gain even terms with the winner and edging a rival for the place honors. VALERIE
FIRST was settled well off the second flight racing to the backstretch, gathered momentum while angling to the inside on the far turn, split foes just off the
rail racing into upper stretch to bid inside the winner and continued willingly inside the top pair to the end. LIL'S TURN, bumped, then shuffled a bit out of
close quarters at the start, steadied slightly racing into the first turn, shifted out three wide racing into the backstretch while being prompted to a position in
the second flight, couldn't maintain terms with the leaders racing into the far turn and steadily faded into the lane. GO GIRL GONE, bumped start at the start
while shifting into the path of the eventual winner, was urged to gain the lead outside a rival racing to the first turn, angled to the rail once gaining a clear
advantage nearing the backstretch, set the pace to the second bend, dueled for command inside the eventual winner on the far turn and gave way into the
stretch. RACHIELY'S DREAM broke inwards bumping GO GIRL GONE, was collected to track outside foes as part of the second flight, raced four wide into
the far turn and came up empty nearing the lane. J'S TWOSTEP BEAUTY tracked off the second flight racing three wide between foes to the far turn but
never gained contention. BOURBON TRACE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MY GIRL ANNIE was rated tracking off the first flight while shifting off the inside racing through the backstretch, was prompted to split foes three deep
nearing upper stretch, shifted outside the pacesetter while being urged to challenge near midstretch and just prevailed in time under firm right handed
encouragement. PUBLICIST, in touch with the first flight three deep between rivals in the opening stages, pressed the issue midway through the turn to gain
a narrow advantage, edged forward into upper stretch, grudgingly resisted the winner's bid to late stages but couldn't contain that rival. NIKKI BELLA, urged
inside rivals prompting the pace from the outset into the turn, dueled inside the leaders to upper stretch and weakened in late stages. DREAMING
DIAMONDS, in touch with the first flight four wide attending the pace, pressed the issue on the turn and gave way racing into upper stretch. R SWEET
EXCHANGE, restless before the start, vied for command between foes racing into the turn and gave way after a half. DON'T SPIN ME, restless prior to the
start, broke in the air while getting away slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
FERBER was prompted to gain the lead outside a rival racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin just off the inside to the far turn, turned
back a rival's bid while shifting out three wide in the lane and held sway to the end under firm handling. STOP WAR, urged to a forward placing while
angling to the rail, tracked just inside the pacesetter to the second bend, was urged to bid inside that foe nearing the lane but proved no match late. THAT'S
MY CUE tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail on the far turn and continued with an effort to improve
position. PYTHAGOREAN, pulling a bit along the inside early tracking just off the second flight, shifted out while being urged to advance between foes into
the lane but had no closing bid. ANDIAMA tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, was urged to advance shifting three wide into
upper stretch but faded late. HEDONISM tracked off the second flight near the inside in the opening stages, swung out four wide racing into the lane but had
no late response. PERT settled into stride off the inside early and failed to menace. BLAZINONBAYOU was a brief factor outside a rival in second flight but
dropped out early. CHICA DIFISEL broke slowly, was a bit rank along the inside and never seriously menaced. REFRESHER proved no factor.
