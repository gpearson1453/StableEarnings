Footnotes
GIMME SOME SLACK vied between horses early, fell back, stayed close, put in a steady effort and wore down his rivals to get up in the final strides.
FENDER BENDER was in tight on the backstretch, bid inside on the turn, assumed command past the eighth pole, led late and was outfinished in a good
effort. CAUSEWAY RUNNER was unhurried early, raced in the back, went seven wide entering the stretch, shifted out, closed willingly and was gaining late.
PERFECT SURPRISE moved up along the rail to set the pace, drew clear on the turn, swung wide into the stretch, was headed past the eighth pole and
continued willingly to the wire. PERCY FAWCETT pressed the pace outside, went eight wide entering the stretch and lacked the needed late response.
DURTDOBBR put in an even effort in an outside trip and did not threaten. SOLAR HEAT was not a factor. RED CHARGER was outrun;. WILD WILD
KINGDOM contended to the turn and stopped.

ADAPTATION went seven wide entering the stretch, closed steadily, got up late and inched clear. IAMOLDFASHIONEDTO set the pace to the final strides
and was outfinished in a good effort. STRYKER'S DREAM pressed the pace inside, angled out on the turn, leveled off and settled for show. ROI
BELENCIAGA was crowded along the backstretch, dropped inside to save ground, got through along the rail on the turn and failed to rally. PAITASKA raced
in close outside and lacked the needed late response. OBSCURE BREW was slow early, went nine wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid.
CRESCENT WILDCAT pressed the pace to the turn, dropped back and gave way. TORR HILL was not a factor. MYBESTISYETTOCOME showed good
early speed while racing between horses and stopped into the turn.

Footnotes
LINEMANS CHECK pressed the pace, angled out on the turn, bid seven wide, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up near the wire. MIDNIGHT
IN MAUI broke out, pressed the pace, swung wide leaving the turn, fell back, continued willingly, assumed command late, led briefly and was caught. DON'T
REMEMBER set the pace, inched clear leaving the turn, led to deep stretch and yielded grudgingly. ME ducked in at the start, was never far back, bid four
wide, closed willingly and gained late. I'LL TAKE YOU OUT was never far back, lacked a rally and failed to menace. HOLLYWOOD DREAMER broke in,
showed speed to the turn and gave way. RUNNING FOR GUS was impeded at the start and had brief speed only. FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM was not a
factor. Hand timed.

the turn, had the rider lose his whip in the upper stretch, led past the sixteenth pole and was outclosed. TAYLOR GALS was pushed in at the start, set a
pressured pace to the turn, continued willingly to the wire and held for show. EBB AND FLOW was slow early, angled out in the upper stretch and closed
well. TANIELL'S CANDY pressed the pace to the turn, fell back and finished evenly. ARIZONA JAX was slow early, lacked room in the upper stretch, angled
in and closed well. ITSTHE BLACK DALIA broke slowly and was outrun. I. C. BLUE was never far back, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a stretch
