Footnotes
VAN CORTLANDT was unhurried to the second turn, bid two wide to the stretch, shifted outside the runnerup in upper stretch, rallied when clear and
surged in the final sixteenth to get there. SHIFTY DANCER stalked the leaders to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, took the lead in mid stretch
but could not shake ZEDEKIAH late and was tagged in the final strides. ZEDEKIAH hustled to contest the pace two wide to the stretch, was collared by
SHIFTY DANCER in mid stretch but dug in determinedly to the line. DRIZZY had no speed, settled to the half, was three wide to the stretch but came up
empty in the drive. GET LIKE ME trailed to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch but also did not rally. BOISTEROUS SKYE attended the pace
inside of ZEDEKIAH to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then tired.

pace to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. CARTOONIST hustled to the front, was off the rail mid turn, responded

G. G. RYDER trailed to the stretch while off the rail and also did not rally. GRAY GEM pressed the pace two then three wide to the stretch then gave way in

steady urging. PAPA DO RUN raced closest the fast pace to the second turn, rallied two wide to the stretch, held a brief lead in upper stretch but was
collared by the winner and saved second. CLASSIC CHAMP broke slow and trailed to the second turn, was three then four wide to the stretch but could not
impact the top two. LOUIE THE GAMBLER was settled to the half, saved ground while closing the gap to the stretch but went evenly in the final furlong. MR.
PAPAS had no speed and saved ground to no avail. REFRACTOMETER was also allowed to settle for a half mile, raced three wide on the second turn but
lacked the needed late response. BERNARDOS HIDEAWAY sped clear under fast fractions to the second turn and tired in the stretch. ZIPPIN WINE was
settled to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch but was never a serious threat. GIMME SPACE also was unhurried off the fast pace, raced three
wide to the stretch then went evenly late. NIZAMDCARCHY had no speed and was not a factor.

NARDINI chased the pace to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch, rallied when set down, pushed to the front in mid stretch and raced clear driving.
MAY SONG attended the pace outside rivals, was three wide to the stretch, got collared by the winner in mid stretch but dug in late to hold second. ENVY
had no speed, chased to the turn, swung out four wide to the stretch, was outfinished and too late for second. ST. ANNIE'S INDY also had no speed, was
forced out to the five path on the turn then could only pick off rivals in the drive. SURREPTITIOUS was chasing to the turn, bid two wide to the stretch, got
outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. MADAME OVERSERVED was outsprinted early then saved ground to no avail. RUN'N DOWN A DREAM had no
speed and was not a factor. DARLING DEMON hustled early to contest the pace, raced two wide on the turn but tired in the stretch. EXSQUEEZE ME was
on the pace inside DARLING DEMON, stayed on to the stretch then also tired.
