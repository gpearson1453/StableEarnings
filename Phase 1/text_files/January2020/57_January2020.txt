Footnotes
MY FRIENDS BEER stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled foes around the turn, was four deep entering the stretch, gained the lead outside rivals
while in hand in upper stretch, drew out under urging and lugged in near the sixteenth pole. PAINT MUSIC FOR ME , forced in by LYNCHBURG leaving the
starting gate, saved ground around the turn, eased out to the two path entering the stretch, challenged for the lead in upper stretch and weakened in the
drive. PARADISE PRIDE , three wide leaving the turn, bid for the lead between horses turning for home and weakened. BARRISTER , three wide on the
turn, angled to the five path in upper stretch and lacked the necessary response. LYNCHBURG bore in leaving the starting gate, showed speed, hugged the
inner rail around the turn and gave way. BACK CHARGE bobbled slightly at the break, showed speed in the two path and faltered after a half mile.

DANCE FOR ORO rated kindly three to four wide, moved up to threaten the leader leaving the five sixteenths, took command four wide into the lane, kicked
clear then held sway while fully extended. PAUL THE WAITER settled well off the rail, edged up past the five sixteenths and was put to pressure, came five
wide for the drive and made a steady run to gain. FLIP , three wide the first turn, took closer order while under a drive between rivals past the five
sixteenths, angled a bit wider for the drive, advanced with PAUL THE WAITER leaving mid stretch then flattened out. GRAND OASIS lacked speed, angled
out leaving the far turn, came five wide for the drive, made a bit of a run heading to the sixteenth marker but failed to seriously follow through.
TAPPAHANNOCK moved up to the outside of a rival and took command with seven eighths remaining, set a rated pace off the rail, was under pressure to
maintain the lead past the five sixteenths, ceded to the winner while three wide into the stretch and weakened in the final seventy yards. READY AND RICH
broke slowly, saved some ground while off the pace, swung five to six wide for the drive but lacked a serious run. CLOSER LOOK saved ground within
range, got through along the rail while under pressure into the lane but came up empty. LIKE WHAT I SEE had speed then rated off the leader leaving the
seven eighths pole, angled out to stalk three wide, was under pressure past the three eighths and gave way.

JUNO leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail throughout and weakened. EXPECT TALK , three deep around the turn, gave way. SUPER HOLY

STROLL SMOKIN broke a step slow, rushed up three wide outside a pair of rivals and took command, sped clear into the turn, set the pace three wide into
the lane, kept on under strong handling past mid stretch then was fully extended to hold off KINGSTON PIKE. KINGSTON PIKE , three wide between
runners while chasing the winner, emerged as the closest pursuer leaving the furlong grounds, altered off heels in deep stretch, finished gamely and just
missed. UNBRIDLED OUTLAW , off slow when a bit rank, regrouped and edged up four deep into the turn, made a mild move to loom mid turn, chased
outside rivals into the lane but came up empty. HAMMERS VISION had speed then chased two wide between rivals, stayed in range to upper stretch then
faded. LASER LOOP vied early along the rail, gave hard pursuit inside a trio of rivals mid turn and gave way.

DAPPER MUN saved ground around the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch, took command approaching the eighth pole and was ridden out.
LUCKY LEONARD hugged the inner rail, challenged for the lead in upper stretch and finished willingly. HUNCA ROCK , three wide between horses on the
turn, failed to rally, galloped out lame and was vanned off. AWESOME BUZZ , five deep on the turn, failed to be a threat. CAPTAIN TRIPS , angled in
leaving the turn, raced along the inner rail in the stretch and passed tired horses. ALL SPUN UP raced in the two path on the turn and was not a factor.
CHARITABLE SPENNY , fractious in the starting gate, set the pace in the two path, weakened and drifted out approaching the sixteenth pole.
CONQUISTODOR FUEGO raced in the four path on the turn and weakened.

YOU MADE IT bid two wide outside LITTLE MISS RAELYN leaving the five eighths pole, dueled with that one around the turn, shook clear under a drive in
upper stretch, dug in when confronted by BUNTING in mid stretch and grimly prevailed. BUNTING edged up nearing the turn, stalked the dueling leaders
three wide, was under pressure past the five sixteenths, shifted out wider past the three sixteenths, bid to threaten in mid stretch, kept on trying but was
denied. SARAH'S TREASURE bobbled and bumped at the break, lagged off the pace, circled four wide into the lane, angled in past the eighth pole and
closed belatedly between runners. MY T TALK chased the leaders two wide, moved closer past the five sixteenths, angled out with run into the lane but
flattened out in the final furlong. LITTLE MISS RAELYN sped clear early and secured the inside, was joined after a quarter mile, dueled to the inside of the
winner from the far turn to about the quarter pole then gave way grudgingly in the final furlong. I LOVE YOU , bumped at the break, saved ground chasing,
stayed on to about the quarter pole then faded. RIGHT NOTION leaned in and bumped a rival at the break, corrected and raced between foes early then
gave way.

Footnotes
HIDENSEEK SALLY chased the dueling leaders, bid three deep into the lane, kicked clear under a left handed drive nearing mid stretch, was kept to solid
pressure to the sixteenth marker then widened while in hand late. TWO HOT BETTY saved ground, edged up under a hustling ride into the lane, steadied
when blocked from the three sixteenths to past mid stretch, found room along the rail in the final sixteenth and churned on willingly to nab the place.
MADAME TIGER broke a bit slowly, was nudged on and took command after a sixteenth of a mile, was hounded from her outside, ceded command mid
turn, kept up a fight past the three sixteenths, came out enough to allow room past the sixteenth marker and faded. UP HILL BATTLE dueled outside a rival
to upper stretch, moved to a short lead mid turn, stayed willingly to mid stretch then gave way.
