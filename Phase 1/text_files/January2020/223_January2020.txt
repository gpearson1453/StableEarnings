Footnotes
NIGHTSTAR was hustled along, vied inside to the upper stretch, inched away under urging and drifted out late. TOP HAT HIGH JINKS contended two
across to the upper stretch, fell back, went evenly late and finished second best. WAY TOO CUTE was void of early speed, went six wide leaving the turn,
closed steadily and was along for show. EITHER WAY raced mid pack, bid inside, lacked a response and did not threaten. BUTTERCUP UP settled off the
pace, lacked a bid and dropped back steadily. SPACE PRINCESS trailed the field and showed little.

JAY LOST CONTROL pressed the pace while racing inside, assumed command on the turn, drew off and extended his lead under urging. STRYKER'S
DREAM raced close to the pace while racing inside, lacked a rally and was no match for the winner. HONOR THE ANTHEM bumped at the start, raced mid
pack, swung wide entering the stretch and offered a mild bid to earn show. TUONO was steadied near the gap, raced in the back in an even effort and
improved position. MISSION RELAUNCH bumped at the start, bid inside on the turn, had nothing left and faded. JUNE AND JOHNNY raced outside and
was not a factor. BIG DUDE was fractious behind the gate and vanned off. CRESCENT WILDCAT was sent to the front, led to the turn and stopped.

EMOTIONAL RIDE was slow early, raced outside, bid ten wide at the top of the stretch, closed under urging, got up late and was all out. ADAPTATION
raced in the back, closed steadily mid track and was gaining ground. HEAT SCORE set a pressured pace to the turn, drew off for a clear lead, led to deep
stretch, faltered and just held show. BLACKDENIMTROUSERS was fractious in the gate, raced mid pack, bid inside to loom a threat and hung.
LANCASTERINVISION trailed the field, went widest in the drive and finished well. MR WICKHAM had brief speed only. STONE CREEK pressed the pace,
challenged for the lead on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
FENDER BENDER broke slowly and was squeezed at the start, steadily advanced, got up late and inched away. DISCO CAT dueled to the turn, inched
away for a short lead, led to deep stretch and was outfinished in a good effort. CAUSEWAY RUNNER broke out, lagged early, went eight wide entering the
stretch and closed to get up for show. WILD WILD KINGDOM stalked the pace, lacked the needed late response and failed to menace. GO YOUR OWN
WAY broke in, dueled to mid stretch and faltered. MINNIE MINOSO was void of early speed, angled out for the drive, bid nine wide and closed well. SUM
CANDY showed good early speed while racing inside, dropped back and finished evenly. SPYDEE was through early and not urged late.

CLEAR THE MINE settled off the pace, challenged for the lead on the second turn, dueled past the eighth pole, drew off under urging and held well.
CAMINO DE ESTRELLA was unhurried early, saved ground, bid inside, closed willingly and was gaining ground. FAMOUS ROCK STAR sprinted clear to
set the pace to the second turn, responded when challenged to duel past the eighth pole, faltered and was safe for show. ROCKANDAHARDPLACE broke
in and failed to threaten in an even effort. PACIORETTY held a good position, was through after a half and not urged late. BOXER BOY failed to contend
and showed little.

Footnotes
BONITA RAPIDS raced mid pack, rallied around the turn, bid nine wide, closed steadily and wore down her rivals to get up in the final strides. FLASHY
GOLD was unhurried early and raced in the back, rallied around the turn, bid inside, assumed command past the eighth pole, inched clear, veered out late
and was outclosed. MY EXPRESSION was well placed, lacked the needed late response and held safely for show. MRS TAYLOR bumped at the start,
sprinted away, set the pace past the eighth pole, faltered and lost position. HEAVENLY HOLIDAY broke out and bumped at the start, raced in the back, bid
inside and had nothing left. IF YOU WANT IT was squeezed, steadied and stumbled at the start, raced evenly and did not threaten. SHARP HOLIDAY
showed speed to the second turn and flattened out. GOFARGOGO was through early and not urged through the stretch.
