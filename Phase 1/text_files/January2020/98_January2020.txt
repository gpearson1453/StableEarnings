Footnotes
BLAZING BROOKE, restless in the gate prior to the start, angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders racing to the backstretch under light rating, shifted
out to split foes approaching the quarter mile marker advancing on the pacesetter, was bumped soundly by that foe midstretch but wrested the advantage
and went clear under firm handling. OUR PETUNIA tracked just off the pacesetter outside a rival while being floated out three wide racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to wrest the advantage in that path midway through the far turn, went briefly clear into upper stretch, was steered out to meet a
rival's challenge making solid contact midstretch and proved no match in the closing stages. CARAMEL MOON hesitated at the start, was settled well off the
field along the inside in the opening half, gathered some momentum while shifting out a bit nearing the lane and found her best stride late to split foes just
off the inside to prevail for a share. AUNT BETTY switched off the inside racing to the first turn while being urged to a forward placing tracking just off the
pacesetter into the backstretch, was urged to prompt that foe while between rivals racing into the far turn, couldn't match terms with the leader after six
furlongs, angled out four wide racing into the lane and steadily faded. BOURBON TRACE settled near the inside in the opening stages, was fanned five
wide into the stretch and made no real impression. SI'MON LI'MON tracked the leaders from out of striking distance off the rail in the opening half and
lacked a rally. SOLD ON SALSA, urged to the lead while angling sharply to the inside racing into the first turn, set the pace for a half, dueled for command
into the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
MOONWALKER, forwardly paced between foes tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening stages, advanced to press the issue midway through the turn,
wrested the advantage while shifting to the inside racing into upper stretch and went clear under firm right handed encouragement. K P CREED tracked just
off the leaders along the inside racing into the turn, shifted outside a tiring foe and made steady progress between foes to prove best of the others.
ARATHORN, forwardly placed three deep between foes in the opening stages, advanced in tandem with the eventual winner to challenge for command in
that path nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final response. FORTY FATHOMS hopped at the start while throwing his head and losing position to
the leaders, settled into stride, angled out four, then five wide racing into the stretch and continued with a mild bid. HEBGONE, held up avoiding close
quarters just after the start, tracked the leaders outside of striking distance, swung wide racing into the stretch but had no closing bid. CIRCLE AWAY
ducked out at the start causing his rider to momentarily lose his irons, was settled last, then made some belated progress just off the inside in the closing
stages. GIANT'S VOICE, caught five wide, then four wide racing off the first flight to the turn, soon faded. COLONEL RED ducked out at the start, was urged
to gain the lead outside foes, angled to the rail after gaining a clear advantage, briefly dueled inside foes but gave out abruptly racing into upper stretch.

Footnotes
DELTA LEVY, reserved in the last flight while working his way to the inside racing to the first turn, shifted out after a half, was prompted to advance outside
foes entering the far turn, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage in time under firm
right handed encouragement. PROFESSIONAL, firmly rated in the opening stages to stalk just off the pacesetter along the inside, continued under patient
handling awaiting an opening racing through the far turn, bid for command along the rail nearing midstretch to strike the front between calls late but was just
outkicked. PURE LUCK, held up in close quarters near the inside in the opening stages, tracked just off the second flight into the far turn, shifted out racing
into upper stretch, then made a steady gain inside foes in the closing stages while just outkicked by the top pair. CORAL LEGACY swerved a bit at the start,
then through the opening furlong while pulling against restraint, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the backstretch, repelled a rival's
challenge leaving the far turn while shifting a bit off the rail and gave out late. WHAT A HOOT was rated just off the pacesetter outside a rival in second
flight, advanced after a half to press the issue on the far turn, then gave way into the stretch. TACTICAL QUALITY was settled outside foes in the last flight
early and never gained contention. ERIC THE SALESMAN tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, was prompted to advance three
deep on the far turn to lodge a brief bid nearing upper stretch but quickly flattened out.

Footnotes
MUNGOJERRIE shifted inwards in the opening stages to attend the pace three deep under light rating, moved clear racing into the turn on his own courage,
held sway on a commanding margin racing well off the rail into upper stretch, was roused twice left handed to extend the margin and was taken in hand in
the final stages after his rider confirmed the issue was decided. FIFTY OVER tracked off the second flight along the inside in the opening stages, came
through inside foes racing into upper stretch to gain the place honors. PALIMPSEST, in touch with the first flight prompting the pace between rivals racing to
the turn, couldn't match the winner and gave way nearing the lane. CHAMPIONSHIP ALLEY, urged to dispute the pace inside foes from the outset to the
turn, gave way after a half. PAPA RALPH J tracked off the second flight between foes but offered no rally. HELLFIRE BOB proved no factor. O DANNY
BOY tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn but faded early.

Footnotes
PHANTOM OPENING was eased just off the leaders while making her way to the rail racing to the first turn, tracked just off the second flight along the
inside, steadily advanced on the pacesetter inside foes after a half, switched just outside that foe to prompt the leader racing into upper stretch, then took
over in the closing stages under some firm left handed pressure. DYNATAIL broke readily, angled to the rail to dictate the pace on a narrow margin into the
backstretch, briefly resisted the winner's challenge racing through the far turn to upper stretch but couldn't contain that foe in late stages. MADAME MILAN,
held up momentarily avoiding close quarters while brushed at the break, was rated outside a rival off the second flight to the backstretch, angled to the rail
racing through the far turn while gathering momentum, shifted out three wide in upper stretch while being prompted to advance but finished evenly late. NA
PALI SPIRIT, bumped at the start, was settled along the inside to the far turn, shifted out nearing upper stretch and made an effort to gain some position
between rivals late. STEELIN MAGNOLIAS, cut off by CALI DREAM, then steadied at the break, recovered quickly to gain a contending position shifting out
three wide nearing the first turn to track just off the pacesetter, was caught four wide racing into the far turn while being urged in brief pursuit of the leaders
but quickly came up empty. CALI DREAM swerved out at the start bumping NA PALI SPIRIT, was righted, then prompted to gain a forward placing tracking
just off the pacesetter a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch but emptied out racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
CASEYOUDIDN'TKNOW, held up when carried slightly by MAIS OUI D'OR at the start, tracked the leaders along the rail from out of striking distance
through the backstretch, was shuffled back avoiding tight quarters nearing the turn, swung outside foes on the turn while being prompted to advance, raced
five wide into upper stretch and rallied to the front in time to just edge MARDI GRAS GIRL nearing the wire under firm left handed encouragement. The
latter exchanged some light contact with WINE BOTTLE at the start while being urged three deep between foes to gain a narrow advantage, vied between
foes just off the inside to the turn, was headed entering the bend, but continued with a steady effort while shifting to the inside regaining the advantage in
the stretch but couldn't quite fend off the winner. THEY CALL ME LUCKY broke awkwardly, was settled last racing to the turn, then split foes three wide
entering upper stretch to make some late progress while gaining a share. RETURN THE FAVOR was settled outside foes racing to the turn, was caught
wide to upper stretch but displayed some belated interest to improve her placing. MONJA angled inwards to track off the first flight between foes racing into
the turn, shifted out four wide nearing the lane and steadily faded. CHANTILLY LILLY ducked out at the start, was quickly righted, then angled inwards
pressing the pace four wide, then three wide into the turn, moved to gain a brief advantage between calls nearing upper stretch but faltered once entering
the lane. WINE BOTTLE, exchanged brushes at the start, was urged between foes, then along the inside prompting the pace into the turn but gave way
after a half. MAIS OUI D'OR ducked inwards at the start crossing into the path of the eventual winner, was righted to track just off the leaders along the
inside to the turn but emptied out early.

Footnotes
SUMMER ASSAULT shifted inwards in the opening stages to track off the first flight outside a rival, angled to the rail racing into the turn, gathered
momentum nearing upper stretch while swinging outside NOW IS, was carried out by that foe in upper stretch but continued with a steady late response to
collar the pacesetter and go clear in time under firm handling and some left handed encouragement. MY ECLAIR was urged to dispute the pace inside foes
while shifting just off the inside in early stages, edged forward while angling to the rail racing through the turn, held sway on a clear margin into upper stretch
but proved no match when confronted by the winner. NOW IS, forwardly placed between foes, angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders racing into
the turn, shifted out to bid between foes nearing upper stretch, drifted out into the eventual winner's path in upper stretch but couldn't produce the needed
final bid. SMOKE ALARM, a bit reluctant loading, was urged three deep prompting the pace, shifted inwards pressing the issue nearing the turn, then
weakened into the stretch. UNCLE BUD, off a step behind the leaders, tracked the pace along the inside, shifted out a bit entering the lane but had no rally.
BLINGFREE broke awkwardly, settled into stride and failed to menace. TIZ ENVY proved no factor. VERY REPLACEABLE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
OX TROT, prominent between foes from the outset prompting the pace just off the inside racing to the turn, continued with a steady bid just outside
BRANDT racing into the stretch and prevailed late under right handed encouragement. BRANDT, urged inside rivals dictating the pace on a narrow margin
racing to the turn, dueled grudgingly inside the winner to late stages but came up second best. NICOLE MUNNINGS, held up between foes dropping off the
first flight in early stages, angled inwards while moving to a position just off the first flight midway through the backstretch, was prompted to advance three
deep between foes when presented an opening in upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. EARLY DELIGH, caught six wide tracking just out of
striking distance in the opening stages, shifted inwards racing into the bend to gain some position three wide between foes nearing upper stretch, shifted out
five wide entering the lane and continued with interest to gain some position. FOUNTAINSTREETKID, a biw slow into stride, settled last to the turn, split
foes three deep nearing the lane, then angled five wide in the closing stages to make some belated progress. CALL ME HANDSOME broke readily to gain a
narrow advantage in the opening stages, prompted the pace three wide between foes into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. STRIKING HEIR,
caught five deep between rivals tracking just off the first flight for the opening three furlongs, shifted inwards tracing four wide into the turn and steadily faded
nearing the lane. SUNSHINES OUT tracked just off the first flight four wide between foes through the backstretch, lost some position entering the turn and
gave way nearing the lane. ROCK RIVER angled to the inside early to track off the first flight but retreated nearing the turn.

switched out racing into the far turn to advance on the leaders, three wide, then four wide between foes nearing upper stretch, was bumped by SUGAR FIX
while shifting into the path of IVORYSGOLDTREASURE nearing upper stretch, shifted out five wide entering the lane while being roused right handed
making contact again with SUGAR FIX but couldn't match that rival late, then was outkicked for second. IVORYSGOLDTREASURE was settled just off the
inside dropping off the last flight racing to the backstretch, switched out after a half, was prompted to advance four wide, then five wide nearing upper

the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, advanced three wide racing into the far turn to press the leaders, struck the front racing into upper
stretch but couldn't sustain that momentum. SPLENDOR BEACH, off slowly, was settled last to the far turn, angled outside foes nearing the lane, shifted
