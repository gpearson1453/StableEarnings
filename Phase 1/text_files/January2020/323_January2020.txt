Footnotes
HAPPY MUSIC engaged with GOTTAHAVEAHOLIDAY right from the very early stages, saw that foe back off temporarily after the first fraction had been
finalized, departed the backstretch from path two, once more forced to tend with the aforementioned opponent, got turned loose coming up to the quarter
pole, went at it head to head with GOTTAHAVEAHOLIDAY for most of the way down the lane and gamely got the job done. OUR TICKET settled into
midpack after the field had been released, travelled four wide on the turn, was put to a drive crossing its midway point, angled one path farther off the rail
entering the lane, whittled away at the deficit, came out beginning from the vicinity of the sixteenth pole from left side pressure, eventually stepping onto the
path of JASMINESQUE, paid the price of getting clipped behind after impeding that foe, ventured onward to be the second to cross the wire.
GOTTAHAVEAHOLIDAY involved with the winner early, got eased back and then tipped into the three path at the top of the turn, applied pressure
thereafter on HAPPY MUSIC, got called upon spinning onto the head of the stretch, dueled on near even terms with the nemesis before being shaken off in
deep stretch. JASMINESQUE pursued the front runners from the two path on the turn, fanned out into the six path from upper to midlane becoming the
widest of all, narrowed in, clipped the heels of OUR TICKET after being bothered by that rival inside the sixteenth pole, didn't regain interest. SHANNON'S
GIRL took the inside route, was under a drive prior to reaching the quarter pole, went into the stretch and made no headway. HAPPYANDIKNOWIT guided
onto the inside route entering the turn, cut the corner into the lane, came up empty. Following a Stewards' Inquiry in addition to a claim of foul lodged by the
rider of JASMINESQUE against the rider of OUR TICKET, the latter was disqualified from second and placed fourth for having caused interference in the
stretch.

Footnotes
GRACETOWN five paths off the inside down the backstretch in pursuit from just off the pace, tucked three wide through the turn and steadily advanced to
take over placed to coaxing just prior to swinging four wide into upper stretch, then drew clear under a drive to prevail. GIRL OF TOSCONOVA six then five
wide in pursuit from the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to knock heads
with OVERHEATED through the final sixteenth and just got the nod for the place honors on the wire. OVERHEATED broke out a step at the start, chased
two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide for home, ran on through to the finish dueling with the aforementioned foe through
the final sixteenth but was ultimately nosed for the place honors while well clear of the rest for the show. CHILLINWITHFRIENDS coaxed from the gate,
raced forwardly placed four wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path and advanced on the leader to take command just outside the three-eighths
pole already under threat from the eventual winner to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got displaced from the front nearing the quarter
pole and swung two to three wide for home, then weakened in the drive. PRINCESS IN CHARGE five then four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three
furlongs from home, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. FLOSS DANCER established the front from the get go and crossed to show the
way from the three path while in hand, tucked inside into the turn, came under threat and got placed to coaxing near the three-eighths when displaced from
the front, faded through the latter portion of the turn, went three wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BELLA INVASION pursued the pace stationed in the two path in midpack, doing so from between rivals during the run around t he bend, was let loose
spinning into the stretch, emerged at the eighth pole as the new leader, lengthened away in final furlong. STEAL MY HEART worked out a tuck into the two
path approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, was hand urged racing on the turn, idled behind another coming up to the end of the bend, went one
path wider entering the stretch and was given her cue, rallied down the center of the strip to best NEW YORK SUPREME for place honors. NEW YORK
SUPREME cut over to the inside after grabbing the advantage, showed the way, pulling a bit on the left side, saw ROSEY'S INVASION prepare to launch
her challenge as the second split was being posted, settled in upper stretch and was switched over to stronger handling, got overhauled by the winner deep
into the furlong grounds, ventured onward then got necked for second. ROSEY'S INVASION sparred for the top towards the two path, swung into the lane
lacked the needed response and gave way. BANKERS DAUGHTER saved ground for the opening half, shifted into path two entering the lane, backed
away. HELMERS RUN broke approximately two lengths the tardiest, was sighted in the two path at the top of the turn, was moved out into path five from
upper to midlane, gained with a mild rally. IRENA N ELLA three wide onto the turn, was spotted into the four path exiting it, made no impact. QUEEN
KIMBERLY took up the chase three wide on the turn, was through after going a half.

ARCHUMYBABY coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, advanced to split foes and take narrow
command spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive dueling through the length of the stretch with the runner up and gamely prevail on the
wire. CARTWHEELIN LULU established the front and showed the way in hand from the three path under some pressure from LETMETAKETHISCALL to
the outside, tucked inside at the half mile pole, remained patiently handled and was headed just before cutting the corner into upper stretch roused for the
drive, dug in knocking heads through to the wire in game fashion but was ultimately bested at the end. LETMETAKETHISCALL a bit fractious in the gate
prior to the start, lunged at the break, prompted the pace four then three wide, got set down spinning four to five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the
late stages while preserving the show honors safely. FIRST FOREVER chased three to four wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. WORLD RIOT coaxed from the gate, chased four to five
wide under a ride from three furlongs out, swung five wide for home and weakened. FLAT CALM five wide in pursuit throughout, got coaxed along at the
three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. EXCEED THE GOAL chased just off the inside under coaxing from midway on the
turn, went three wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
TOO FAST TO PASS made contact with GAULTIER after breaking to the outside, got going, sat forwardly placed four wide on the turn, swung into the
stretch, came up to the three-sixteenths marker and was turned loose, took charge in short order then kicked clear. JAVELIN took up the chase from the two
path on the turn, angled five wide into the lane, straightened away and rallied for the place. GYPSUM JOHNNY out springing from the gate, bumped
soundly with CHAMPAGNE PAPI, took up position in midpack, travelled about five wide on the turn, got steered out towards path seven after stepping into
the lane, went on to secure the show. REAL DAN strung out five wide on the turn, wandered out into path eight during the stretch run, closed in despite
refusing to save ground throughout. SCARF IT DOWN disputed the pace from the two path, got let out for the drive home, was reeled in at the furlong
grounds, faltered. MONEYMEISTER tracked the front runners from along the inside route, was under urging the corner with clear sailing on the inside
corridor, failed to fire. WHAT A CATCH pursued the pace three wide on the turn, between rivals for much of the journey leading up to the quarter pole, failed
to keep pace heading home and soon gave way more readily. LANGDARMA hard to load, secured a prominent position, took up the chase from the two
path on the turn, was asked for more in the general area of the five-sixteenths marker, moved out five wide early during the drive, lacked the needed
offering. GAULTIER (FR) squeezed due to pressure coming from the winner at the start, sat parked out five wide on the turn, was slightly wider stepping
onto the top of the lane, never got involved. CHAMPAGNE PAPI bumped hard at the start, cut over to the rail at the half mile pole, got set down prior to the
quarter pole, came up empty.

Footnotes
SLIMEY four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, rallied to close well outside issuing a
challenge through the final furlong to the top pair, took over a sixteenth out and inched away to the finish. CARRIZO hustled from the gate, raced briefly in
the two path before tipping three wide soon after the start, tipped out once more near the half mile pole to be four wide into the turn, advanced on the front
through the bend coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, continued four wide into upper stretch, dug in rallying to issue a challenge a furlong out,
fought between foes from the eighth pole to the sixteenth marker when displaced in tandem with the leader by his barn mate at that station, then ran on to
secure the place honors. QUEEN KAHEN settled four then three wide in closest aim of the leader under a rating hold, took over command under her own
power at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home set down for the drive, dug in under threat from a pair and was collared a sixteenth out, kept on
clear of the rest to preserve the show honors. REFLECT three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home,
weakened in the stretch. BREAK CURFEW chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. CHAMPAGNE BLISS three wide in the early stages, tucked to chase just off the inside with six furlongs to run, took to the inside half a mile from
home, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. SEA SPARKLE hustled from the gate, showed
the way in hand from the three path, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under increasing pressure to the outside and got placed to coaxing at the
five-sixteenths when displaced from command, cu t the corner into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
INDEPENDENCE HALL away last after lunging at the start, was steered out towards the middle of the strip, powered his way into a forward position without
need of encouragement, was about four wide departing the backstretch,took over, maintained interest during the run around the bend being lightly hand
ridden by the pilot, arrived at the quarter pole with the pressure having intensified, settled in at the three-sixteenths pole and was switched over to a hand
drive, responded instantly to open up, shied when shown the stick from the right side for the initial time a sixteenth down the road, saw the rider apply it
intermittently beginning a few jumps later, drifted in yet managed to extend the margin nevertheless. PRINCE OF PHAROAHS went to the outside after the
field had been sent on its way, chose to take the three path stepping onto the turn, picked up interest and narrowed in on the winner, got cued up
challenging as three-quarters was being completed, was guided over closer to the rail, got staved off, ventured onward to finish in a dead heat for place
honors. BOURBON BAY came out of the gate towards the back of the pack, was in the five path stepping onto the turn, inched up late on the bend, spun
about as wide into the lane under a drive, mustered up a mild response to claw his way into a tie for second. CELTIC STRIKER stalked the pace three wide
for nearly three-quarters and gave way. POLAR BEAR PETE reserved taking up the chase two to three wide, was worked into path four from upper to
midlane, had no rally. DUBAI BOBBY vied for the top from along the inside to the top of the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
AUTOSTRADE broke out at the start bumping his stable mate PURCHASING POWER, chased two to three wide patiently handled until set down angled six
wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command a sixteenth out, then edged away to the finish kept busy to the
end. BOOBY TRAP chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a
furlong out, dug in and was collared at the sixteenth marker, ran on to safely secure the place honors. PURCHASING POWER bumped at the start by
AUTOSTRADE who broke outwards, chased three to four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild
kick. WOODBURY four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, bid for command at the quarter pole spinning three wide, was
on near even terms for the front straightened away, then weakened in the final eighth. CAPTAIN FROST away directly to the front, showed the way in hand
just off the inside, tucked inside at the half mile pole, came under pressure near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside for home maintaining his now
slight advantage, dug in and was collared just outside the eighth pole, weakened in the final furlong. DOOLEY tossed his head to the off side just as the
latch was sprung and dwelt at the start conceding about ten lengths to the front before settling into stride under coaxing, raced seven paths off the inside
down the backstretch at the tail of the field, tucked to the two path half a mile from home advancing to latch on the rear of the field, got coaxed along at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, tipped out near the eighth pole and passed tired rivals through to the finish. SOUNDS GOOD got bumped
twice at the start by LOCAL EDITION who broke outwards, chased six then five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung seven wide into upper
stretch and offered no response. LOCAL EDITION broke out at the start bumping SOUNDS GOOD twice, chased three then two wide in closest aim of the
leader placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. INTERNET OF THINGS chased just off the
inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide at the head of the stretch and tired.
BLUE SKIES FOREVER broke in at the start and got corrected, chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide for
home and made no impact.
