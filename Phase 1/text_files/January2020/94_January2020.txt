TIP FOR TAP was hard ridden from the gate to make the front before going a furlong, stayed along the rail around the turn, widened into the stretch and
was taken in hand. FU MAN SUE was fractious in the gate, didn't break sharply, angled sharply to the outside midway on the backstretch, made a run in the
four path around the turn and passed tired ones in an even finish. YES SIR COLONEL went in the air in the gate at the break, left a few lengths behind the
field, was urged along while making a four wide run around the turn then flattened out in the lane. OCTORARO ORPHIE lagged inside early, came out into
the two path on the turn then made a late run between tired ones in the lane. WIDGET FACTORY bumped with A T M AWESOME leaving the gate, moved
early to press in hand outside the winner, raced two wide around the turn then stopped in the drive. ALL TACKED UP bumped with A T M AWESOME
leaving the gate, had position three wide between rivals into the turn then stopped. A T M AWESOME bumped with ALL TACKED UP leaving the gate then
bumped with WIDGET FACTORY soon after, had position while four wide into the turn then stopped.

Footnotes
TALLULAH DARLING was fractious and reared in the gate, set the pace inside of two rivals early on while staying in the three path, built a clear margin
passing the seven sixteenths pole, widened her advantage around the turn, but flopped back to her left lead when coming under right handed pressure
passing the furlong pole before switching back to her right lead when under left handed pressure at the sixteenth pole, and had enough to hold off
ARCHANA to the wire. ARCHANA settled in midpack, saved ground into the turn, slipped inside of a rival to achieve place at the quarter pole before shifting
off of the rail to the four path turning for home, then was gaining through the stretch on the loose leader, but did not have enough to catch her.
RAISETONEW HEIGHTS was off slow and shied outwards from an inner rival at he start, trailed the field around the turn while hugging the rail, was in a bit
tight behind PRIDE IN THE BIZ turning for home, but angled outside of that rival in upper stretch and finished willingly. PRIDE IN THE BIZ broke outwards
and raced off the pace in the two path, angled to the rail and cut the corner turning for home, but got oufinished by RAISETONEW HEIGHTS for minor
rewards. OUT 'N ABOUT was forwardly placed early on while being kept in the five path by multiple foes, but failed to keep pace with those rivals passing
the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the seven sixteenths pole and weakened into the turn. DAMISELA forced the pace setter while being kept in the
four path by that rival, but failed to keep pace at the seven sixteenths pole, and weakened in the three path around the turn.

Footnotes
HEADED FOR HEAVEN saved ground while advancing to a striking position around the turn, steadied slightly behind the tiring early leader at the quarter
pole, but swiftly angled out turning for home and split foes while two wide in upper stretch, then commenced a rail rally through the lane to catch the loose
leader in the final stages. GUILTYWITHANEXCUSE stalked along the inside and quickly gained ground on the leading trio around the turn, was full of run
while looking for racing room passing the five sixteenths pole, tipped three wide at the quarter pole and drew off to a clear lead in upper stretch, but was
caught by an inner rival in the late stages. RAISEDTOBEAWARRIOR gained ground along with HEADED FOR HEAVEN through the turn while outside of
that foe, waited behind the leaders at the quarter pole before angling to the four to five path in upper stretch, then passed tired foes willingly while not
threatening the leaders. MOSCOWS GOT TALENT settled off the fast pace in the four path, came into the lane in the five path and passed tired rivals.
PARTY ROCK hounded the fast pace three wide while being coaxed throughout, but was floated four wide while weakening at the quarter pole.
ENIGMATICA forced a fast pace while two wide, between horses, and under coaxing throughout, forged a lead into the turn, but was headed passing the
quarter pole and stopped through the lane. SWEET DANCER trailed and was never involved. OUR GRAYCIOUS GIRL set a fast and pressured pace inside
of multiple rivals, but weakened passing the five sixteenths pole and stopped.

Footnotes
NICK PAPAGIORGIO showed speed two wide between horses, moved to a short lead early on the backstretch, began to bear out on the final turn, ran out
into CANDY ASSET entering the stretch then bore out steadily into that one through the final sixteenth despite right handed whip. Following an objection by
Gonzalez, NICK PAPGIORGIO was disqualified and placed second. CANDY ASSET settled outside, made a strong four wide run into the far turn to vie,
was bumped in early stretch then was carried far out through the final sixteenth. MAIN COOL CAT was caught wide while unhurried around the first turn,
made a run in the four path around the final turn then flattened out. BOYS OF QUEENS was fractious in the gate, broke slowly then outfinished tired ones
while no factor. NOT FAKE NEWS made the early pace three wide, remained prominent for about six furlongs then stopped. WARLEGGAN bumped with
JOINT STRIKE leaving the gate, stayed along the rail while with the leaders into the far turn then stopped. JOINT STRIKE bumped with WARLEGGIN
leaving the gate then was outrun.

Footnotes
ITGOT GRANDMA came in at the start causing BRAVE DEACON to take up, stalked the leader in the two path, pulled between horses into the backstretch
to vie for the lead at the half mile pole outside of SILVERZAR, took over from that rival into the far turn, then held an advantage until drawing off in the late
stages. SILVERZAR set the pace along the inside through the first turn, met pressure from ITGOT GRANDMA at the half mile pole and came under coaxing
to keep pace, but was headed by that foe into the far turn, cut the corner turning for home, and kept on to prove second best. PIPPIN was crowded early on
as ITGOT GRANDMA came inwards, settled in midpack along the inside, split foes two wide around the far turn to gain to striking range three wide at the
quarter pole, but flattened out through the lane. BRAVE DEACON was off a half step slow and steadied as ITGOT GRANDMA broke inwards, raced far off
the pace in the four path, came into the lane in the five path, and mildly gained ground through the lane. BOOMBA BRAD trailed in the two path around both
turns, shifted to the four path turning for home, and passed tired rivals while lugging in. BIZ NASTY had a slow start, saved ground while far off the pace, but
to no avail and weakened through the lane. MANATEE prompted the pace from the three path while a bit keen around the first turn, but faltered passing the
half mile pole.

the outside after five furlongs then drove clear past midstretch. SINGING THE BLUES was slow early, began a run in the three path on the turn, closed
outside and was up for the place. SNIPER SIS was fractious in the gate, showed speed outside, moved two wide to a clear lead early on the turn then
weakened in the drive. HUNTER REVOLUTION ducked in, bumped with MARY ELIZABETH leaving the gate, fell back, trailed into the final furlong then
passed tired ones. MARY ELIZABETH bumped with BARCELONA leaving the gate then bumped soon after with HUNTER REVOLUTION, bumped with
BARCELONA while between rivals nearing the end of the backstretch, stayed out from the inside around the turn and tired. BARCELONA bumped with
MARY ELIZABETH leaving the gate then again when outside that one nearing the end of the backstretch and tired. ARCTICA hit the inside of the gate at

Footnotes
CHAPEL OF CHIMES set the pace in the two path, established a clear lead into the backstretch, widened her margin through the far turn and upper stretch,
then was geared down passing the sixteenth pole. BEATUBYACHUBINOSE saved ground in midpack, advanced along the rail through a wide hole passing
the quarter pole, made a bid for place inside of multiple rivals at the furlong pole as the rider lost his whip, but still prevailed for that placing while not
threatening the leader. NEW FOUND TREASURE stayed in the three path around the first turn, advanced to midpack between horses down the
backstretch, attempted to swing outside of tiring leaders at the quarter pole, but shifted back to the two path turning for home as her ahead rivals drifted
outwards, made a bid for place between horses at the furlong pole, but got outfinished for that spot while hanging on her left lead. L. A. HOUSE stalked
close to the loose leader along the inside, failed to keep pace with that foe into the far turn, gained place while drifting to the three path turning for home, but
weakened at the sixteenth pole and got outfinished for minor rewards. JUSTGIMMEAKISS trailed along the inside through the first turn, advanced inside of
rivals before shifting to the four to five path into the far turn, then swung to the seven path turning for home and made a mild rally. PERINA'S PRIDE raced
in the four path in midpack, was driven into the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch while hanging on her left lead. JUMPIN JETT prompted the pace
from the three path, but failed to keep pace with the pace setter into the far turn, drifted to the five path in upper stretch, and weakened. SPRING AWAY was
void of early speed three wide through the first turn, took hold of the bit and advanced to midpack down the backstretch, but failed to sustain her gain
through the far turn. BOWTIE DIVA failed to factor while racing in the four path. MYDRINKSELECTION was unprepared and had an awkward start, pulled
along the inside into the first turn, but was outrun thereafter.
