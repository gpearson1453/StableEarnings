FORT ROYAL lightly bumped with UNDER A SPELL soon after the break, sped to the lead, set the pace off the rail and was kept under encouragement in
the drive. BAYSIDER saved ground around the turn and rallied mildly. SAN MARCO lacked speed, circled the turn, drifted in near the eighth pole and
passed tired horses. COOL MAN CLETUS hugged the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor. LUNAR IMAGE , well off the rail, swung wide in upper
stretch and gave way. UNDER A SPELL lightly bumped with the winner soon after the break, chased the pace, gave way in mid stretch, pulled up lame and
was vanned off.

Footnotes
ROOKIE SALSA , up close inside stalking the contested pace, lacked room from the quarter pole to the three sixteenths when caught behind a trio of rivals,
angled out past the three sixteenths and gathered momentum, shifted back in past the furlong grounds, closed relentlessly under right handed rousing, took
command late and was edging away at the line. CANDYGRAMFORMONGO prompted the leaders three wide, bid three deep into the lane, kicked away
while being flashed the stick in mid stretch, kept on willingly under steady handed encouragement but failed to hold off the winner. FORFIFTYFIVEROCKET
, bumped at the break, recovered and settled about four wide, circled five wide into the lane and had a mild response. TAPPIN HONOR had speed to
contest the pace outside D C FIREMAN, battled with that one into and around the turn, raced between rivals soon into the lane then weakened in the final
furlong. CONFUSION BABY BOY came out at the break and bumped with a rival, raced off the pace while saving some ground, angled four wide and came
up empty. D C FIREMAN dueled inside for a little more than a half mile, failed to contain CANDYGRAMFORMONGO in upper stretch, stayed willingly a bit
longer, faltered and was eased late.

FAST MASTER hugged the rail around the turn, eased outside in upper stretch, closed outside the leader, led late and drove clear. THE CAIRO KID
accelerated to the early lead, angled to the rail mid way down the backstretch, set the pace and gave way grudgingly. UNIVERSAL PAYDAY , soundly
bumped leaving the starting gate, circled the turn three wide, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside rivals. KING NEKIA chased the pace
two wide around the turn and gave way. GRAN WILDROCKY bumped UNIVERSAL PAYDAY when bumped and forced in by KULULKAN leaving the
starting gate, trailed to the stretch, swung to the six path in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. CREATIVE GENIUS lacked speed, raced in the two path
on the turn and retreated through the stretch. KUKULKAN stumbled after bearing in and bumping GRAN WILDROCKY leaving the starting gate, circled the
turn three wide, gave way and was eased.

BERNIE'S ON FIRE showed speed along the inner rail down the backstretch, was taken to the two path approaching the half mile pole, gained the lead
outside CAREY TIMES in upper stretch and held sway under energetic urging. CAREY TIMES accelerated to the early lead, was taken to the inner rail mid
way down the backstretch, lost the lead in upper stretch and battled back. WHISKEY AND YOU saved ground around the turn, eased outside in upper
stretch and gained late. SACRED MOUNTAIN , lightly steadied soon after the break, was never a factor. ON THE TURF , a forward factor three deep on the
turn, weakened.

Footnotes
VANESSA'S SECRET , in mid pack saving ground early on, picked up steam leaving the three eighths pole and moved in tandem with RENDERING,
angled out and advanced between rivals into the stretch, sustained and forged to command under right handed pressure approaching the sixteenth marker
and drew clear. RENDERING , bumped at the break, recovered and started a three wide run leaving the far turn, moved up between foes soon after, angled
five wide into the lane, lugged in briefly near the three sixteenths, corrected and continued willingly to be second best. KEEPER IN SPITE broke sharply and
held the early lead, allowed SPECIAL POWER to go on and then prompted that one from the outside, gained command mid turn and drew clear heading to
the quarter pole, wandered outward a bit near mid stretch, dug in when collared then faded late. PLAYLAND chased the leaders, angled three to four wide
into the lane but came up empty late. HOME BY SEVEN , sluggish from the gate, saved ground while well back early, angled out and had mild interest.
SPECIAL POWER rushed up inside to take command, set the pace towards the rail, was pressured leaving the far turn, ceded mid turn and weakened in
upper stretch. OUR REVEILLE gave early chase and faded. ASTARTE GOLD , bumped at the break, lost ground four wide pursuing around the turn and
dropped back. TORIA bobbled and jostled at the break, raced wide and failed to recover. MELISANDE came in at the break bothering foes and was outrun.

Footnotes
MOON VIRGINIA lacked speed, hugged the inner rail around the turn, remained near the rail through the stretch, closed inside MORTAL STORM and took
the lead in deep stretch. MORTAL STORM rushed to the early lead, saved ground setting the pace around the turn, came off the rail in mid stretch, drifted
out inside the sixteenth pole and faded. CONJECTURE chased the pace outside MORTAL STORM and lacked the needed rally. TANDA'S JOY lacked
speed, was taken to the five path turning for home, failed to be a factor and passed tired foes. FAIRY WISH , two wide on the turn, drifted to the four path
entering the stretch and failed to rally. FIRTH prompted the pace two wide and weakened. ANNIKA GOLD , no factor, circled the turn three wide and drifted
to the six path turning for home.

VOW TO DANCE , brushed at the break, lagged off the early pace, raced five wide into the lane, angled out a bit wider when moving up past the three
sixteenths, forged to command nearing the sixteenth pole and drew away under a drive. NOT MY MONEY , in the clear stalking the leaders, angled four to
five wide and ranged up into the stretch, moved to a short lead in mid stretch, faded late but lasted for the place. STIVA came in a bit at the break and
brushed the winner, prompted the pace three deep, bid to challenge past the three eighths, failed kick on with the leader leaving the quarter pole but
churned on enough the gain the show. SACRED LADY vied outside BECKON before going clear heading to the three quarter pole, dropped in to set the
pace, handled outside pressure leaving mid stretch, held a clear advantage leaving the quarter pole, ceded the lead in mid stretch and faded. BECKON
sparred to the inside of SACRED LADY leaving the chute, rated back and angled out nearing the three quarter pole, rebid mid turn, forced the issue
between foes nearing the lane then gave way in the final sixteenth. HOLLY'S LADY broke awkwardly, saved ground and lacked a serious response.
