Footnotes
THE ROBERT, two wide and unhurried early, moved to the rail after a half mile, lacked racing room on the final turn, split into and through stretch and
edged away under mild handling. MACHTREE stalked two wide, took the lead after a half, held a clear lead with a furlong to run but then was no match.
HONOR AND COURAGE, just off the rail, split rivals on the final turn, moved out into stretch and faded. ECLIPSED MOON raced wide and failed to be a
serious threat. DON POLO, just off the rail in second flight, moved out four wide on the final turn and tired. QUENCH MY THIRST, outside second flight,
tired. A J'S WAY showed little. NICO BREE N TEEJ saved ground setting the early pace then had nothing left.

MIAMI TIGER, racing in the four path, split rivals rallying on the final turn, took the lead near sixteenth pole and quickly drew off. CONTROLLED FURY
saved ground to near stretch, moved off the rail but was no match. BRIDGET'S BIG LUVY set the pace along the rail, drifted out entering the stretch and
faded. KID MAC COOL, very wide early, moved in and rallied between rivals but flattened out. GOTTA GET AWAY, four wide into and rounding the first
turn, remained wide stalking the pace then tired. HOMEBOY saved ground and failed to menace. GENERAL BELLAMY came out at the start and bumped
SUNSHINE WILD, raced two wide and just off the pace then gave way. SUNSHINE WILD, bumped leaving the gate, raced very wide. SIGHT LINE showed
little.

Footnotes
C C'S CUP OF TEA set the pace racing with a clear lead, opened up on the turn, drew off under urging in upper stretch, then was in hand for the final yards.
LIL MISS HOTSHOT chased along the inside, raced inside on the turn, rallied into second and then dug in late to hold that spot. BARLEY JACK raced off
the pace inside, moved up inside on the turn, angled out three wide into the lane, rallied and just missed for second. COUPELLA raced two wide off the
pace, came four wide into the lane and gained mildly outside. BREE'S GOT HEART raced two wide off the pace and had no rally. NISHA chased between
rivals and tired. HELOTES bobbled at the break, chased three wide and tired. KRISSYS MANICURE raced off the pace inside and did not factor.

Footnotes
IMMUNITY was bumped and bobbled leaving the gate, raced between advancing, angle in through the stretch and won going away. FORGE dueled for
command two wide, took the lead on turn, opened a huge advantage mid stretch, drifted out and faltered. YOU'RE NO SAINT raced very wide throughout
and closed well. HE'S GOT TALENT saved ground just off the pace and had no rally. TRUSTING FRIEND, in the four path, offered a mild bid on the turn
then flattened out. DODDSPRIVATELABEL, very wide, passed faders. GURT BOYS was never a serious threat. SUNSHINE MARK dueled inside, drifted
out leaving the turn and gave way. FRATELLO DEL NORD, four wide in top flight, had little left. NINETYEIGHTOCTANE raced outside and failed to
threaten. GLASS BRIDGE, three wide, had brief speed. CARDIO COWBOY came in after the start, vied for command three wide then stopped.
