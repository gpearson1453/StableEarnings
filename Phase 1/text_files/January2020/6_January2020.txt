Footnotes
BUFFON vied for the early lead, took command around the turn, pulled away and proved much the best. ENTICING SHAQ challenged for the early lead,
forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but held on for second. MAJOR BIZKIT dueled for the early advantage, raced behind the top
two and was just outfinished for second. OLIVER'S PRAYER lacked early speed, made a late bid and finished willingly. SUDDENLY broke a step slow,
racing in the rear, moved up, but was no factor. KISS YOUR BRIDE always raced near the back, made a late mild bid, but was no threat. FRIEND OF
DUBAI dueled near the front, saved ground and faded. THE VINCENATOR pressed the early pace, raced outside around the turn and was finished early.

Footnotes
RUNNING ROSADO unhurried in the early going, moved up on the inside around the final turn, waited entering the stretch, split rivals and drove clear
before the wire. TWO WITH A TEN raced within contention, made a wide late bid and was a clear second. CONNIE BABY vied for the early lead, forwardly
placed throughout, but proved no match for the top two. INTERATIFWITHLEU dueled for the early lead, saved ground and weakened down the home
stretch. CALLHERMRSGELNER lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. WHAT'S MY DOIN raced within striking distance, came
around the first turn four wide, lacked a rally and put forth an even effort. G'S DEADLINE raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. CANDY
CANDY CANDY pressed the early pace, raced three wide around the final turn and faded. CONSPICUOUS LINE void of early speed and was never close.
DARING DARIAN always raced in the back and showed little.

MY COWGIRL stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up on the inside around the turn, pulled away and proved the best. MISS CINDY LOU WHO
challenged for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. EIGHT GRAND raced within contention,
came around the turn four wide and was just up for the show. SASSY MALLORY unhurried in the early part, made a late bid, finished willingly and missed
the show position. ALOHA KAI void of early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. SHOW'EM THE HEAT raced in the middle of the pack, put forth
an even effort and weakened. GLADYS' FRONTIER dueled for the early lead and was finished early. KATELINE'S DREAMER void of early speed and was
never close.

THEGOODWITCH sprinted to the front, pulled clear, led throughout and finished well. ACTIVE GIRL raced in the middle of the field, came around the first
turn four wide, moved up around the final turn, proved no match for the winner, but held off REALMENTE CALMADA for the place position. REALMENTE
CALMADA raced near the middle of the pack, saved ground around the second turn, made a late bid and missed second. DREAMY ART raced within
contention and weakened. TOGA'S MARGROCK lacked early speed, moved up, but was no factor. LIL ALLIE DANCER lacked early speed and was never
close. SENORITA CLOSIN IN raced within contention and retreated to the rear.

sharp, went to the front, lost advantage around the turn, couldn't keep up with TACTICAL PRIORITY, but held off ELISHER for the place position. ELISHER
hesitated at the start, racing from the rear, moved up four wide around the turn, made a late gain and finished willingly. READY REDDING pressed the
pace, lacked a late bid and put forth an even effort. GWEN TRIBUTE hopped at the start, raced in the back and was never a factor. BROOK IS GOLDEN

PARADISE REUNION unhurried in the early part, moved up on the outside around the final turn, took command, was going away and proved much the
best. ANGEL CAT void of early speed, moved up, racing four wide around the second turn, made a late gain, but was no match for the winner. PERFECTLY
PRECIOUS raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout, but was no match for the top two. U THOUGHT U GOT ME lacked early speed, moved up
on the inside around the second turn, made a late gain, but was no factor. SHREW GRIT dueled for the early lead and weakened late. FRIGID pressed the
pace, racing four wide around the first turn and lacked a late bid. JOZZY BELL challenged for the early lead and made a steady retreat. AIM SPOT vied for
the early lead and was finished early. BATTY raced within contention and dropped back. FINEST KYLIE raced near the back and was never a threat.

ROLL ON BABY unhurried in the early going, saved ground around the final turn, angled out and got up late. SASSY SUSA went to the front, drove clear
and got caught deep in the home stretch. SECRET JOY pressed the pace, made a late bid, finished willingly and was outfinished for second. KEEN'S SHOT
void of early speed, made a mild bid, but was no factor. BUGGELS GIRL raced within striking distance, came around the first turn four wide, faded and was
no threat late. TOSHITA FOREVER pressed the early pace and was finished early. GALLOP'S STAR was an early factor, saved ground and stopped. Due
to a timer malfunction some internal fractions are unavailable.

unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the second turn, finished willingly, but proved no match for the winner. GIRL THIRSTY raced
within contention, forwardly placed throughout, but was no match for the top two. KODIAK SKY brushed at the start, racing in the back, made a late gain
and was outfinished for third. HICLASS PRODUCTION lacked early speed and passed tired ones. STAR GAZE raced within striking distance, saved ground
around the second turn and weakened. OUR EASTER LILY went to the front, drove clear and tired late. NANA'S JOY brushed at the start, raced near the
back and was never a threat. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

DON LOUIS stalked the leaders in the early going, made a bid around the final turn and drove clear down the stretch. GOOSE challenged for the early lead,
dueled throughout, but couldn't match strides with the winner down the home stretch. PUNCH OUT raced in the middle of the field, made a late bid and
proved no match for the top two. JAZZY G vied for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, weakened and lacked a finish. WARRIORS WOLF
raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, improved position, but was no factor. SOUL TEMPTATION broke in, checked, racing in the back, moved up,
but was no threat. SECRET VISTA raced evenly near the back and was outrun. CASTLEMAN dueled on front end and tired around the final turn. OPLIN
raced within striking distance and dropped to the back.
