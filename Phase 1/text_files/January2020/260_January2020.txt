Footnotes
PRAY WITH FAITH dueled 2w under steady pressure to keep pace, forged a lead away from is inner rival passing the five sixteenths pole, drew off in upper
stretch, and just held off CALCULATED THINKIN's late bid at bay at the wire. CALCULATED THINKIN saved ground tracking the leading duelers from
midpack, shifted to the three path in upper stretch and commenced a late rally, but just missed at the wire. WARCRAFT stalked in the four path early on,
forged ahead of his inner foes to claim third while under a drive into the turn, then mildly progressed outside of the leaders around the bend, but flattened
out at the furlong pole. THAT'S HISTORY dueled inside of PRAY WITH FAITH early on, but relinquished the lead to that foe passing the five sixteenths
pole, then gave way in upper stretch. TEN HUT saved ground while trailing around the turn, then offered a mild rally through the lane without threatening.
SUPER VISION settled far off the pace, took the turn in the three to four path, but failed to factor. HAYNESFIELD BEST stalked in the three path, but
weakened between horses passing the quarter pole. POLAR JET hopped at the start and was off multiple lengths behind the field, took the turn in the four
to five path while outside of rivals and far off the pace, and failed to get involved.

DULCIBELLE (GER) bumped with SUNSHINE BAY soon after the break, moved to a short lead soon after, drew out two wide early on the turn, widened
under urging into the stretch and remained clear under a drive. FAIRFIELD came out leaving the gate, bumped SUNSHINE BAY, settled inside early,
advanced two wide between rivals around the turn, bore out under left hand whip through the lane and gained mildly. ALILBIT SHADY broke slowly, trailed
early, circled into the stretch then made up ground too late on the outside. LILIA was slow early, stayed inside and made up some ground. BAYANNE
unseated her rider while fractious in the gate, raced wide around the turn and tired. SUNSHINE BAY was bumped leaving the gate, bumped with the winner
soon after, took to the outside midway on the backstretch, improved position on the turn then faded quickly in the lane. GOLD MEDAL GIRL was hard used
to be press early inside inside the winner, stopped in the lane and was eased up. MISS STEFFI was no factor.

Footnotes
SKOOKIE set the pace inside of COOLWATER while staying a bit off the rail, shook away from that foe turning for home, drew off in upper stretch under
driving pressure, then shifted outwards and was geared down approaching the wire. COOLWATER reared in the gate before it opened, then pressed
SKOOKIE from off of her flank while being kept in the three path by that rival, but failed to keep pace and proved no match for that foe in upper stretch, and
just held off FORMAL DUTCHESS's rally for place. FORMAL DUTCHESS saved ground around the turn while trailing, shifted off of the rail to the three path
in upper stretch, and commenced a rally, but just missed place while not threatening the leader. MINNOW stalked in the three path, but failed to keep pace
with the leaders around the turn, then held fourth through the final furlong. MONTH OF SUNDAYS subtly made up ground in the five path around the turn,
but lacked a further rally in upper stretch. JERSEY STORM saved ground from midpack, but had no rally. ON MAGIC WINGS angled from the two to the
five path turning for home while far off the pace, but failed to get involved. THISONESFORJEN took the turn in the four path while weakening.

MARNESIA BIG GIRL was rated two wide outside the early leader, moved to the front early on the far turn, drew out approaching the lane and widened
under brisk urging. INCLUDE GOLD was bumped leaving the gate and again soon after, was never far back, made a run in the three path around the final
turn to gain striking position, flattened out in the lane and wasn't persevered with through deep stretch. ROMAN REIGN ducked out into INCLUDE GOLD
leaving the gate then again soon after, lagged early inside then came between tired rivals in the lane. PLATINUM AFFAIR took command at once, was
urged along to make the pace to the far turn, stopped and was eased up late. MISS FORESTER wasn't far back while caught in the four path around the
first turn, remained prominent to the end of the backstretch then stopped.

PENNY IN LOVE stalked along the inside through the first turn before shifting off of the rail into the backstretch, made a two wide bid for the lead outside of
OUR GRAYCIOUS GIRL passing the five sixteenths pole and readily drew off, widened her advantage through upper stretch under a mild hand ride, then
was geared down while her margin was diminishing through the late stages, but held safely. ROSES FOR RUBY trailed early on, advanced position into the
far turn, split foes in the three path around the second bend, shifted to the four path in upper stretch and sustained her rally through the late stages to cut
the gap on the eased up leader, but was kept at bay. TREASURE TIME was off a step slow, split horses in the two path at the seven sixteenths pole and
commenced a rally inside of rivals around the far turn, but flattened out in the final furlong and got outfinished by an outer rival. OUR GRAYCIOUS GIRL
established a clear advantage around the first turn, but was headed by the eventual winner passing the five sixteenths pole, then weakened between horses
after drifting to the three path turning for home. ALL ABOUT BLEU took the first turn in the four path while far off the pace, trailed around the far turn while
still in the four path, then passed tired rivals. PUPPET stalked in the two to three path early on, but failed to keep pace approaching the half mile pole, was
floated to the four path. MAGIC HAPPENS was caught three wide in midpack around the first turn, angled to the rail down the backstretch, but weakened
around the far turn.

COURTESY SHUFFLE was fractious in the gate, had to be reloaded, had her head turned to the inside by the assistant starter at the break, left several
lengths behind the field, swung wide into the stretch while rallying, closed far out into the track and was along in time. TWO FOR TEN was reluctant to load
then was fractious in the gate, was sent to vie three wide on the turn, opened a short lead before a half, bore out under left hand whip through the lane and
gave way at the end. DETERMINED LOVE steadied in tight along the rail entering the turn while just behind the early leader, steadied again in early stretch,
angled out sharply and finished willingly between the top two. PINK showed speed from the outset, raced two wide between rivals on the front end around
the turn then weakened. ROCKFORD GIRL made the pace along the rail into the stretch then weakened.

Footnotes
CHITOWN split foes passing the five sixteenths pole to commence a rally, tipped from the three to four path turning for home, and sustained her bid to get
up inside the final sixteenth. QUEEN'S BIRD dueled two wide while holding a slight advantage, kept her inner foe in tight quarters and brushed that rival
straightening into the tane, then forged clear passing the furlong pole, but was run down by an outer foe in the late stages. AUDUBON WOOD stayed in the
two path inside of rivals around the turn, shifted to the five path inside the final three sixteenths, then rallied mildly for show. JUMP SHOT settled far off the
pace two wide early on and made a mild rally splitting rivals through the lane, but missed show. FOXY B stalked the dueling leaders from the three path, but
lacked a kick while in range in upper stretch before weakening through the final furlong. CURRENT ENERGY dueled inside of QUEEN'S BIRD, but was kept
in tight quarters and brushed by her outer dueling counterpart straightening into the lane, then weakened passing the furlong pole while hanging on her left
lead. ELIAV had her head turned to the left when the gates opened and was off slowly, saved ground while far off the pace, shifted to the five path turning
for home, and failed to get involved. RING THE BELLA was urged along to keep pace from midpack in the four path, but weakened around the turn.
