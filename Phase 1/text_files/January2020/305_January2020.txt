Footnotes
RAGING BLAZE grabbed command soon after the break, set a rated pace two wide while handling outside pressure, moved clear leaving the far turn, was
coaxed along maintaining command past the quarter pole, widened under stronger urging past the three sixteenths then held firm while kept alert with some
right handed encouragement. KICKSTARTMYHEART saved ground while never far back, got through along the rail for the final furlong and closed steadily
to gain the place. TAPDANCING GIRL rated forwardly towards the inside, shifted out three wide to loom into the lane, chased but came up empty late.
SAND IN MY SHOES lost ground four wide outside rivals, stalked the pace to upper stretch but failed to seriously kick on. MIGHTY MOLLY forced the early
pace outside the winner, was under urging between foes mid turn, pursued into the lane then gave way. CORNETTA'S CHOICE broke slowly, was angled
out and pulled a bit early on, was put to pressure around the turn but failed to respond.

Footnotes
LUCID DREAM settled in the two path and well off the early pace, eased out when gathering momentum mid turn, progressed four wide into the lane,
sustained under left handed rousing and forged clear nearing mid stretch, kept on under a drive and held off SIR DOUGLAS. SIR DOUGLAS bobbled at the
break, settled off the early pace while saving ground, commenced a run past the half mile pole, eased out in upper stretch, split rivals leaving the furlong
grounds and gained to the inside of the winner. TARNISHED JUSTICE , three wide early, angled out mid turn, circled five wide into the stretch, moved up
near mid stretch and continued with interest. TOP HAT WARRIOR , keen to go early, opened up a lengthy advantage while two wide, remained well clear
past the three eighths, was taken on past the three sixteenths then gave way grudgingly. CHARGING LION , away alertly, allowed the leader to go on and
dropped in to pursue, made a mild run into the lane, failed to sustain and weakened in the final furlong. FORTY ACRES broke slowly, lagged off the rail and
was outrun.

FACTOR IT IN was bumped at the start, settled off the duel along the rail, angled four wide to rally between foes nearing the quarter pole, continued on h is
left lead in the lane, seized command approaching the sixteenth pole and readily drew off under a drive. HOLLIS dueled along the rail inside of two wide
foes early, dueled in tight quarters inside a foe while exchanging light brushes from the three-sixteenths pole to midstretch, could not withstand the winner in
the final sixteenth but dug in to save the place. FIBER AND EMILY dueled between foes down the backstretch, dropped back a bit midway around the turn,
angled three wide into the lane and had a mild re-bid to just miss second. CHARGE TO VICTORY stalked the early pace three wide, bid three deep into the
turn, led midway around the turn, angled in nearing the three-eighths pole, ,dueled outside of HOLLIS from there while exchanging brushes to midstretch
then weakened late. OLDIES BUT GOODIES bobbled inward and bumped the winner at the start, chased the pace two wide, came five wide into the lane
and lacked a bid. EASTERN BAY was outrun in the two path.

Footnotes
TWO L'S MEOW , brushed at the break, settled off the pace and off the inside, advanced between rivals mid turn, angled out and circled into the stretch,
closed five wide under left handed rousing and forged clear leaving the three sixteenths, kept on under a drive and held off VICTORY GIVEN. VICTORY
GIVEN bobbled inward at the break and brushed with the winner, taken to rate off the pace while saving some ground, edged up into the stretch, eased out
and moved between rivals nearing mid stretch, shifted back in and finished gamely to gain. LITTLE HARBOUR forced the pace three wide and between
foes nearing the turn, gained a short lead into the stretch, could not resist the winner and weakened a bit in the final seventy yards. FINAL PROOF edged
up in hand past the five eighths and sat perfectly off the leaders, shifted out and had aim four wide for the drive, failed to seriously kick on past the three
sixteenths, had his rider lose the whip near mid stretch and faded. STARRY SKY lagged off the pace, raced off the rail in upper stretch, had belated action
but failed to menace. ROCKIN RON , three to four wide, failed to rally. COCKTAIL SHAKER prompted the pace four wide outside the leaders, came under
pressure past the half mile marker, failed to go on and faltered nearing the lane. BRADY'S PALACE rushed up inside foes leaving the chute and took
command, set the pace two wide while handling some outside pressure, ceded into the lane and faltered through the final furlong.

Footnotes
SEXYAMA tracked the pace four wide, cruised up to the lead in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. JUDI BLUE EYES pressed the pace two wide
between foes, led late on the turn, had no response for the winner in upper stretch but stayed on willingly to be clearly second best. SILENT FLUIDITY
exchanged bumps with SI MAMACITA after the start, raced off the pace three wide, came five wide into the lane and was along for show. SI MAMACITA
exchanged bumps early, was bottled up behind horses two wide to upper stretch then finished willingly. NO QUESTION stalked the pace three wide inside
of the winner and came up empty in the lane. TOMA chased the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. REDEEMED SPIRIT set the early pace along the rail
and retreated through the lane.

CALL ME JELLY ROLL edged up to the inside of a pair of rivals nearing the three quarter pole and entertained the pace, was well handled disputing the
issue with ANNIKA GOLD around the turn, responded when set down and spurted clear in upper stretch, widened in mid stretch, drifted out late and held
firm while steadily hand ridden the final sixteenth. DOROTHYFROMDUBLIN bore out when rank at the break, regrouped and settled well off the inside,
gathered some momentum mid turn, came five wide for the drive and churned on willingly to gain the place. LADY TERP sped to the early lead while well off
the rail, rated back off foes past the three quarter pole, was under a ride pursuing three to four wide approaching the stretch, gave effort through the lane but
was out finished for the place. TANDA'S JOY lagged back off of a slower pace, saved ground most of the way and continued with interest. CASSIDY AVE ,
well placed into the turn, dropped back mid turn, angled out and came up empty. ANNIKA GOLD bid between foes to take a short lead after a quarter mile,
dueled outside the winner from the half mile marker to the five sixteenths then weakened. FLOATING BY , forced out at the break by
DOROTHYFROMDUBLIN, recovered and raced off the pace while five wide between foes, eased back past the five eighths, angled wider for the drive but
failed to threaten. BAMBOO GARDEN , four wide between runners early on, angled in and gave way.

MAGICAL LUNA set a clear pace off the rail and held well clear under a drive. LANDING ZONE raced off the pace outside, gained three wide around the
turn, never threatened the winner and was along for the place. WIN THEN GRIN saved ground off the pace, angled out near the quarter pole and lacked the
needed rally. COMPETITIVE QUEEN chased closest to the winner in the clear in the two path and faded from the three-eighths marker.

Footnotes
SEANY P angled out early and stalked the contested pace, was put to a solid ride mid turn, shifted out to be four wide into the lane, made a grinding run
under strong handling and forged ahead in the final jumps. I'MTHETAPITNOW dueled inside, shook clear nearing mid stretch, kept on gamely but just failed
to hold. BIG BOOTS , off the early pace while three wide, angled out in the drive and steadily gained. MEET CUTE saved ground while under pressure past
the three eighths, angled out for the drive, edged up some in mid stretch then flattened out. POWERFUL VENEZUELA , off the pace while about four wide,
had belated action. TAPPAHANNOCK gained a short lead early on, vied outside I'MTHETAPITNOW from the five eighths, kept up the battle around the
turn, came three wide for the drive and weakened. LAST CHUKKER , three wide nearing the half mile marker, gave way. BIG IRON , five wide early,
dropped in some nearing the turn and retreated.
