Footnotes
MISS MI MI got engaged with NISHA shortly after the start, was rated in the two path attending that rival all the way to the end of the bend, tipped out
approximately four wide for the drive, arrived at the three-sixteenths marker and was turned loose, emerged a few jumps down the road as the new leader,
steadily extended the margin under good handling. NISHA was along the inside route matched up with the winner, settled in upper stretch and was switched
over to stronger handling, relinquished, stayed on for the place. COBRA SOPHIE two wide onto the turn, got sent out towards path five exiting it, proved no
match. NOWITNA RIVER saved ground to the quarter pole, angled three wide into the stretch, had no offering.

Footnotes
VICTORY BOULEVARD four wide in pursuit, advanced on the top pair through the latter portion of the turn, got set down spinning four wide into upper
stretch and took over command, went clear under a drive to prevail. HOSTILE WITNESS five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two
path at the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to
secure the place honors. TIPAZO chased in closest aim of the spurting leader along the inside down the backstretch, tipped two to three wide through the
turn pressing that rival from the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took over narrow command and swung three wide into upper stretch,
yielded straightened away and weakened. IHADADREAM broke a half a beat slow, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut
the corner into upper stretch and passed tired foes. GRITO DE PABLITO hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the half mile
pole, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired. JOHN WANT REVENGE broke out at the start, chased four wide
until tucked to the two path half a mile from home, swung three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. BIG'S GRAY DAY coaxed from the gate intent
on the front, showed the way through a swift opening quarter coaxed along under some pressure from TIPAZO keeping close watch just in behind, came
under increasing pressure from that rival through the turn to the outside, succumbed near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home and folded.

PRAIRIE FIRE away without apparent mishap, was set up at a slight distance from off the rail, was rated along drafting behind the runner up on the turn,
awaited suitable options as the half was being completed, managed to angle its way into the two path at the three-sixteenths marker and was given its cue,
chipped away at the deficit, out-dueled ELEGANT ROSE from midstretch to the sixteenth pole then edged away. ELEGANT ROSE disputed the pace while
spaced at a slight distance from off the rail, drew out to his largest advantage late on the bend, settled in upper stretch and was put to a stronger ride, saw a
duel get ignited with the winner soon afterwards, relinquished for good about a sixteenth later, held the place. CADEAU DE PAIX underwent a
ground-saving journey, cut the corner driving, went on to secure third. DIRTY BIRD pursued the pace three wide on the turn, got asked for more springing
from the five-sixteenths marker, commenced the stretch one path wider, made no impact. HAPPYCREST reserved two wide for nearly a half, got steered
out five wide during the initial portion of the stretch, lacked the needed response. TRANS MISSISSIPPI away awkwardly, attained a forward position,
disputed the pace two to three wide for a half and folded.

HIP HIP JORGE sparred to the outside of NEW FRONTIER during the initial stages, picked it up noticeably to kick clear of that opponent as the first fraction
was being finalized, moved over into the two path, showed the way loosely-contested on the bend, got turned loose stepping into the head of the stretch,
responded and drew off. NEW FRONTIER off the inside at the time, vied with HIP HIP JORGE for command on the backstretch, saw that foe take off
coming up to the half mile pole, tipped to be outside that rone at the top of the bend, winding up in the three path, stalked while applying only a minimal
amount of pressure, was set down for the drive home, failed to cut into the deficit, but stayed on well nevertheless to salvage second. CONQUISTADOR
underwent a two wide pursuit on the turn, angled into the four path for the stretch run, got outfinished. TRI SAINT LORENZO off a half length the slowest,
remained in the two path two for nearly a half, was more towards the inside route stepping into the lane, had no rally. JUSTINSPEIGHTOFIT guided to the
rail at the half mile pole, rode it to the end of the bend, shifted out three wide from upper to midstretch, gave way.

LONE ROCK ranged up shortly after the start to vie from the two path with a pair to his outside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at
the seven-sixteenths, angled three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive shaking briefly away to the eighth pole before being confronted by the
runner up, dug in under an off sided stick, had the rider switch the stick to the near side inside that station and lost the handle on the near side rein briefly
before picking it back up in a twirling motion to steer and herd out his main danger three to four paths inside the final sixteenth got corrected when getting a
nose up nearing the wire to prevail in the very last jump. HAIKAL coaxed from the gate, settled three to four wide in pursuit from near the rear of the
compact field down the backstretch, tucked two to three wide through the turn patiently handled until angled out near the quarter pole, got set down spinning
six wide into upper stretch, rallied being guided inwards to look the leader in the eye nearing the eighth pole, dug in on even terms and took brief command
a sixteenth from home before being herded out three to four paths through to the finish fighting on game but was ultimately denied at the end. SMALL BEAR
five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top pair while along for
the show honors. MULTIPLIER coaxed from the gate, vied three then two wide between foes, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide
into upper stretch and weakened. VORTICITY vied five then four wide with a pair to his inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run as well as
a Claim of foul by the rider of HAIKAL alleging interference against LONE ROCK in deep stretch. After review, the Claim of foul was dismissed and the
result was allowed to stand before being declared official.

Footnotes
TRUTH HURTS stalked the pace from the two path, staying within striking distance for the opening three-quarters, was cued up for the drive home, stepped
into the lane with room along its path with which to launch a rally, did so and narrowed in, forged past AUTONOMOUS inside the eighth pole and edged
away. AUTONOMOUS was set up in the three path along the backstretch, crept up to the pacesetter while being held in reserve during the run around the
bend, poked a head down in front as three-quarters was being completed, settled in upper stretch and was given her cue, emerged at the eighth pole
desperately clutching to a slim advantage, had it snatched away soon afterwards by a resolute opponent, ventured onward for the place. QUALITY HEAT off
the inside throughout, kept watch three wide on the turn, commenced the stretch slightly wider, mustered up a mild response for the show award. BAY
JEWEL sent over to the rail coming up to the half mile pole, angled five wide into the stretch, made no headway. STUNNING MUNNINGS vied for the lead
from along the inside, yielded to the winner coming up to the quarter pole, backed away steadily down the lane. LOOKIN DYNAMIC saved ground for the
three-quarters pole, had no rally after being tipped into the two path at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
VINEYARD SOUND established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside under some prompting from LOADED JOE early on, remained
patiently handled until coming under some pressure near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home set down for the drive, edged away under a drive
kept busy to the finish. STATE OF MINE four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, ran
on to chase the winner home clear for the place honors. MINE THE COIN lunged at the start, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch before
darting to the two path at the half mile pole, tipped out three wide at the three-eighths as LOADED JOE began to back away in the two path, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and kept on to secure the show honors well clear of the rest. TIO BLAS five to six paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn, got coaxed along three furlongs out, went six wide at the head of the stretch and improved
position for the last major share. SPLITTING EIGHTS broke in brushing the near side stall at the start before continuing inwards before being corrected,
chased three to four wide until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, cornered three wide into upper stretch and was
unable to make an impact. LOADED JOE prompted the pace of VINEYARD SOUND from the outside three then two wide, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths in the midst of getting shaken off, faded through the latter portion of the turn and went just off the inside into upper stretch, then tired in the
drive. AFLEET MICKEY forwardly placed five wide in pursuit, tucked four wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing midway, swung three to four wide
at the top of the stretch and tired.
