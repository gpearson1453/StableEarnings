stretch in the two path under the whip, rallied to make a bid inside of the leader into the final furlong then drew away under steady urging. D'OR FILLE went
around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was roused leaving the backstretch, went five wide while ridden along on the far turn, chased the
leader into the final furlong and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. FRONT MONEY MORGAN raced in the four path on the first turn,
prompted the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader in the three path on the far turn, took the advantage near the five-sixteenths, moved clear
under the whip while four wide into the stretch, was headed just inside the furlong marker and faltered while able to get the show. COMPROMISING was in
tight off heels early, went two then three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the
stretch and failed to rally. STAR PERFORMER was taken up early, went five wide on the first turn, settled at the back on the outside, dropped in under
urging at the half-mile pole, saved ground on the far turn and failed to threaten. JUST CRUISING went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside,
dropped back under urging with a half-mile to run, went five to six wide on the far turn, moved out near the three-sixteenths, drifted in outside the
sixteenth-pole and failed to respond. ANDTHEBANDPLAYEDON broke out at the start, went to the front, set the pace while inside to the two path, lost the
lead at the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and faded. PROUDMONEY was hustled from the start, raced in the three path on the first turn,
was well placed just off the pace, chased in the four path on the far turn and stopped. THREE-QUARTER FRACTION WAS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO THE

Footnotes
WINGS OF FURY went to the front, set the pace in the two path, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, responded well when asked for her best in upper
stretch, battled with the runner-up in the final furlong and gamely prevailed under strong urging. PRICELESS NELLIE prompted the pace on the outside in
the three path, was asked on the far turn, drew even with the winner at the five-sixteenths, dueled outside of that foe in the stretch, drifted out near the
sixteenth-pole and missed while able to get the place. CIRRUSLY went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was roused while five wide on
the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and finished with good courage for the show. MADISON'S WILD ONE was taken back early, rounded the first turn
in the two path, settled at the rear, went four then five wide on the far turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and finished with good energy for the last spot
in the superfecta. CELESTIAL DREAM broke out but was quickly corrected by the rider, went four wide on the first turn, was well spotted towards the front,
went around the far turn in the two path, came under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. FIKA went around the first turn in the three
path, was reserved off the pace, remained on hold while four wide on the far turn, was asked while five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. REVEALING
QUALITY went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while three then four wide on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper
stretch and failed to threaten. CHAMPAGNERIE went four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, came under urging leaving the
backstretch, chased four wide on the far turn, bumped with a rival while dropping back inside the quarter-pole and had nothing left. UPGRADE ME saved
ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and failed to respond. LA VIDA went five wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, raced three wide while between horses on the far turn, bumped with a foe while dropping back inside the quarter-pole and
capitulated. TELL TONTO settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and faltered. (Rail at 14 Feet)

DUNCASTLE moved in while well placed just off the pace under restraint, drafted near the inside under a tight hold on the turn, was asked then moved to
the two path around the three-sixteenths, found a seam between horses and made a bid at the furlong marker, gained the lead outside the sixteenth-pole
and proved best under strong urging. JUST MIGHT was reluctant to load, settled off the pace, started the turn in the two path, shifted three then four wide
later on that bend, rallied into upper stretch, closed well to make a bid into the final furlong, failed to match strides with the winner in the final sixteenth but
finished with good courage for the place. SNOOSE GOOSE stalked the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole,
made a bid in upper stretch, led into the final furlong, lost the lead outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while able to get the show. A SONG FOR
ARCH was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, angled out in upper stretch, held a good striking range into the final furlong but was
out-kicked. COMMANDING CANDY was ridden along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch, held a reasonable
striking position into the final furlong but flattened out and lacked the needed response. BATTLEBUS disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along
the rail on the turn, was asked while coming a touch off the inside into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. UNCAPPED broke a
bit slow, was urged along at the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LOCALLY OWNED was
ridden along towards the rear, went two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor. IMPEACHABLEOFFENSE broke a
half-step slow, settled on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. TOUGH CHARLIE disputed
the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and faded. (Rail at 14 Feet)
