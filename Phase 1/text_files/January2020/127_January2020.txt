JET N G raced unhurried early, advanced six-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew off with something left. NO PASA NADA
was away alertly then reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, offered a bid approaching the stretch, was no match for the
winner in the drive but finished well to hold the place. LOVER BOY BOB pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to engage nearing the quarter
and gave way in the drive. MY INDIAN WARRIOR pressed the pace from between foes and gradually gave way. WHEREDOESTHECASHGO broke
sharply to set a pressured pace from off the rail and weakened through the final furlong. HERMANO lagged throughout.

was taken back early, went four wide into the turn, angled out in early stretch, was closing fast and just missed. ZEN YETI raced in mid pack early, went
seven wide into the turn, was gaining late and needed more ground. M G M SPRING set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail and weakened.
BRYNLEE'S LEMONADE was unhurried early, raced between rivals and finished belatedly. SCARLET STREAK was void of any early speed, went three
wide into the turn and offered some late gain. PREMED followed the early pace, and was no factor. EASTER PUNCH was outrun early and was no threat.
