DREAMING ABOUT YOU was outrun to the half, saved ground on the second turn, was blocked briefly behind rivals in mid stretch but shifted in and quickly
regained momentum, rallied, battled the runnerup and edged that one. JAIMI JAMES tracked the pace to the second turn while inside rivals, shifted out
three wide into the stretch, rallied when set down, was on terms with the winner in deep stretch but was bested. LORETTA got sent along early to contest
the pace, dueled from the rail to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then was outfinished. LIVE IT WELL attended the pace outside of LORETTA, raced
two wide to the stretch, continued to be a factor to mid stretch then tired. AMERICAN ROYALTY had no speed, settled to the half, was fanned four wide to
the stretch then came up empty in the drive. ENGLISH EMPRESS was settled to the second turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch but gave out after
six furlongs.

Footnotes
MANY MOODS hustled to the lead, set the pace off the rail to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then held under steady urging. MR. DIPLOMAT chased
the pace to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then finished wllingly and got the nod for second. MO DINERO stalked the pace early, got fanned four wide
on the turn, was outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task, was closing and just missed second. SMOKE AND BURN had no speed, raced three wide to the
stretch then was gaining in the late stages. OMACHE KID pressed the winner three wide to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly.
PAMPERS N' BOOTS had no speed, was off the rail into the turn then swung out four wide into the stretch and was gaining ground belatedly.
HAWTHORNE LANE dropped his head then reared in the gate at the start and was pulled up by the rider in front on the gate and walked off. The stewards
conducted an inquiry into the start of the race but determined that HAWTHORNE LANE had received a fair start and no change was warranted.

Footnotes
TAP IT CHAMP chased the leaders under urging to the turn, raced three wide then eased out in upper stretch, rallied when set down, closed steadily and
prevailed driving. HONEYMOONZ OVER attended the pace off the rail to the stretch, responded in the drive but could not hold off the winner. DETANGLER
was settled to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then finished in a rally but was too late. CATS BLAME had no speed, raced two then three wide to the
stretch and closed steadily in the late stages. MY FRIEND TONY tracked the pace two wide to the stretch, responded when set down but had to shift out
twice while blocked by rivals in the final furlong. SUNRISE JOURNEY hustled to contest the pace from the rail to the stretch, got collared in mid stretch and
weakened. MIRROR IMAGE chased the leaders from the rail to the stretch but also was giving way in the final furlong. IZ INVINCIBLE got outsprinted,
raced three then four wide on the turn but came up empty in the drive. OWNING had no speed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SUPER TONY had good speed, set the pace off the rail to the stretch, responded to edge clear to mid stretch then was tiring late but held under strong
urging. AFFIRMRACER was bumped by CYCLOTOM at the start, had no speed, was fanned four wide on the turn, shifted out widest for the drive and
closed steadily for the place. RUNAWAY INDY was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then also was gaining ground willingly.
NEXTPORTOFCALL stalked the winner to the turn, came two then three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then did not rally. PASTOR MIKE
had no speed, raced two wide on the turn then shifted out looking for room but was blocked, shifted back inwards and finished in a mild rally. NEAH BAY
stalked the pace to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch but weakened in the drive. LOST THE MINISTER broke a bit slow then was sent hard to get
into contention, saved ground on the turn but tired in the lane. CYCLOTOM broke inward, bumped AFFIRMRACER, was outsprinted to the turn, raced three
wide to the stretch then gave way.
