Footnotes
EVIL WOMAN settled outside, rallied three wide to the front midway on the final turn, moved clear approaching the lane, angled in and held stubbornly after
a long drive. MAXIMUM ENTROPY settled inside the winner while racing out from the inside, made a run into tight quarters behind the leaders entering the
far turn, came out three wide for room midway on that turn, loomed boldly outside the winner into the final furlong but wasn't enough. LION AND THE WOLF
pressed two wide outside the early leader, gave her best between rivals on the final turn and had nothing left for the drive. GRACEYGAB broke slowly,
raced outside in the three path and tired. GOLDEN TIARA broke slowly and stopped. CUTEFACECHUBYWAIST took command at once, stayed close to
the rail while making the pace for about three quarters, stopped and was eased up through the lane.

Footnotes
RAISEDTOBEAWARRIOR tipped to the four path into the turn to stalk outside of the leaders, bid for the lead turning for home, and drove past approaching
the furlong pole. ANNA MAY OUR QUEEN was far off the pace in the four to five path, and made a mild rally through the lane to achieve place without
threatening the leader. BRONZE CHARM trailed two wide into the turn, shifted to the five path while inside of ANNA MAY OUR QUEEN turning for home,
got outkicked by that rival inside the final furlong before shifting outside of her in the late stages, then made a belated gain to miss place. SOBEIT SYLVIA
had a slow start, pulled her way past horses along the inside down the backstretch, tipped off the rail into the turn to pass a tiring early dueler, then split foes
in the three path approaching the furlong pole to bid for minor rewards, but got outfinished. HURRICANE PATRICIA stalked the early duelers from the four
path, made a bid for the lead around the turn, but failed to sustain it and weakened between horses approaching the furlong pole. ZANDORA dueled two
wide to set a pace that eventually collapsed, forged a lead away from her inner counterpart into the turn, cut the corner turning for home, but was headed in
upper stretch and gave way. ME GUSTA PAPI dueled inside of ZANDORA early on to set a collapsing pace, but weakened into the turn and stopped.

OLD FAITHFUL dueled along the inside of a pair of rivals down the backstretch, took back to shift outside of those foes approaching the quarter pole, rebid
for the lead in the four path passing the furlong pole, and prevailed under driving pressure. PAPADOPALOUS trailed in the three path turning for home,
inched closer to the leaders and shifted in at the furlong pole as the leader drifted outwards, then made a late bid for the lead inside of rivals, but got
outfinished. CINDERELA EL CROME dueled three wide outside of a pair of rivals, forged a lead from those foes approaching the quarter pole and built a
clear advantage in upper stretch, but tired and drifted outwards passing the furlong marker and gave way between rivals through the late stages.
INTERCEPT broke outwards, stalked the trio of dueling leaders from their outside, came into the lane in the five path, but failed to make any headway. SIR
ROCKPORT prompted the pace from between the dueling leaders, inched forward to duel for the lead as well into the turn, but weakened passing the
quarter pole, and faded while hanging on his let lead through the lane.

PATTY'S BOY advanced in the bit down the backstretch, made a bold four wide blitz to the lead passing the five sixteenths pole, dueled through through the
stretch as JONATHANTOQUICK dug in towards his inside, but kept an advantage through the lane and prevailed gamely. JONATHANTOQUICK stalked
two wide, made a three wide bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, but was instantly hounded by PATTY'S BOY, dug in as that rival forged a slight lead,
dueled gamely inside of that foe through the lane, but was unable to regain an advantage and was denied. KNOWN QUANTITY vied along the inside into
the first turn, allowed others to go on and stalked from the inside down the backstretch, shifted off the rail into the far turn, then to the four path turning for
home, and was gaining willingly on the leaders from the five path through deep stretch, but did not have enough to catch them. HEART OF A WARRIOR
prompted in the four path then dueled two wide down the backstretch, got the better of his inner counterpart around the far turn, but was headed
approaching the quarter pole and faded in upper stretch. DIGGERS DIAMOND dueled inside of HEART OF A WARRIOR down the backstretch, but was
coaxed to keep pace passing the half mile pole before weakening around the far turn. JASPER K saved ground while trailing around the turns, and never
got involved. SAN ELIJO saved ground from midpack around the first turn, but vacated the rail and weakened to last into the backstretch, stayed in the five
path around the far turn and never got involved.

WARFRONT PEACE RVF made a four wide bid for the lead from midpack around the turn, reached the front approaching the quarter pole, dueled as her
inner foe dug in through the lane, and prevailed gamely. YOURS COMPLETELY dueled inside of a rival while staying in the two path, dug in as
WARFRONT PEACE RVF made a bid to grab the lead approaching the quarter pole, gamely dueled inside of that foe through the lane, but was denied.
RED HOT DAME broke inwards, took the turn in the five to six path while far off the pace, and made a belated rally through the lane.
GOTTAFLATHAVEHER shifted three wide and advanced to striking position between horses into the turn, but lacked a kick to split the leaders in upper
stretch, then got outfinished by an oncharging rival for show. TWO SIXTEEN vied along the inside then stalked the pace setters into the turn, waited for
running room along the rail, but came up empty, failed to kick through a rail opening turning for home, then got outfinished for minor rewards.
BESTATGETTINBETTER took the turn in the five path while far off the pace, and failed to factor. STONE COLD broke outwards, vied for the lead while
three wide, but weakened and faded between horses around the far turn before being eased passing the furlong pole. LIZ'S PARTY GIRL was close to the
early leaders in the three path, but faltered into the turn and stopped through the lane.
