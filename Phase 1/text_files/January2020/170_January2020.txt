Footnotes
YANKEE DIVISION away well, was in the two path disputing the pace with QUINTARELLI on the backstretch, cleared that opponent and slid over to th
inside routel at the top of the turn, came under intense pressure from the second place finisher right afterwards, was switched over to stronger handling in
the vicinity of the five-sixteenths marker, as was the nemesis, displayed good determination down the lane to put that foe away and kick clear. INVEST
stalked the ongoing pace dispute for the opening half, moved up to press the issue once QUINTARELLI backed off, went about the task two to three wide
on the turn, got asked for more at the five-sixteenths pole, was out-fought down the stretch. QUINTARELLI lost his footing as the field was sent off and
running, recovered almost instantaneously, secured a forward position, argued for the top from along the inside on the backstretch, kept watch on the top
twosome springing from the half mile pole, tipped into the two path at the head of the stretch, fell back readily but salvaged the show. SMIDGE strung out
approximately four wide on the turn, made no impact. TRUE BLUE GIANT pursued the pace two wide for three-quarters and gave way. JACK BO departed
the backstretch towards the four path, swung into the lane, tired in the final furlong. PAYNTER'S PRIZE three wide stepping onto the turn, failed to menace.

QUIXOTIC established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home, remained patiently handled spinning
just off the inside into upper stretch, got roused straightened away, dug in under a drive edging clear through the final furlong to prevail. MR PHIL chased
just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, remained patiently handled advancing to issue a challenge when set down swinging three wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a bid to the eighth pole, got shaken off inside that station while along well clear of the rest and second
best. TWELTH MAN forwardly placed four then three wide in aim of the front, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered three to four wide for
home, weakened in the stretch while along for the show honors. BETTS brushed the near side stall at the start, chased five paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then three wide through the turn placed to coaxing midway, continued three wide for home and tired. WARFRONT FIGHTER chased two to
three wide down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired.
REPLICANT broke a half a beat slow, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no
impact. THE KOHEN chased three then two wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, faded through the latter portion of the turn
and went five wide at the head of the stretch, then folded in the drive.

CHIEF KNOW IT ALL away well, cemented itself to a forward position, stalked the pace from the two path during the opening half, moved up to press the
issue stepping onto the turn one path farther off the rail, was yet being well held issuing up a challenge as three-quarters was being completed, struck the
front narrowly soon afterwards, got called upon for more spinning into the lane, drew out to a command advantage before getting geared down in the last
seventy yards. TOUR DE FORCE vied for the top from the two path, relinquished to the winner late on the far turn, got roused coming into the lane, was left
farther behind, saved second. MILLS chased the pace from the two path during the initial stages, too a respite in the pocket, not benefiting from cover
however, from midpoint on the backstretch to the top of the second bend, was then maneuvered into the four path, was about as wide going into the lane,
proved no match. DADDY D T two wide early, was closer to the rail by the conclusion of the backstretch, faltered. CALCULATED RISKER three wide on the
clubhouse bend, worked out a tuck on the rail by the half mile pole, stepped into the lane and gave way. NEIGHBORHOOD BULLY rode the rail for
three-quarters, went three wide into the lane to no avail and retreated.

Footnotes
BUSTIN SHOUT showed the way in hand just off the inside through swift splits, tucked inside at the half mile pole, remained patiently handled until set down
spinning just off the inside for home and drew off under a drive to prevail. BUSTIN HOFFMAN seven paths off the inside down the backstretch just off the
pace, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one
while running on to secure the place honors. POSSETIZZLY six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn
placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. IMAGINAR stumbled at the start
recovering into COOLBOY and pinching that rival aback against MORGANTOWN, chased three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung seven wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. SEVEN IS HEAVEN brushed at the start
by TIZGAME who broke inwards, chased inside briefly before tipping to the three path, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into
upper stretch and passed tired rivals. MORGANTOWN bumped at the start by COOLBOY due to pressure from IMAGINAR, chased four wide until tucked to
the two path at the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. VENTUS four to five
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and tired. TIZGAME broke in at the start brushing SEVEN IS
HEAVEN, chased just off the inside put to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and made no impact. LEAP TO GLORY six paths off the
inside down the backstretch in aim of the front, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide
for home and tired. COOLBOY got bumped at the start by IMAGINAR who recovered outwards from a stumble and was pinched back against
MORGANTOWN, chased four wide from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs out, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and was
unable to make an impact.

Footnotes
MO DIDDLEY one of the quickest out of the starting gate, retained a forward position, disputed the pace from the three path, going about his business as
the outermost of a threesome beginning from midpoint on the turn, settled in at the three-sixteenths pole and was given its cue, responded as a duel with
BLUE BELT commenced just a few jumps later, out-fought that opponent to prove best. BLUE BELT got going after an abbreviated hand ride, was contently
pocketed tracking the front runners during the initial stages, hitched up to them coming up to the three-eighths pole, managed to wrestle away the
advantage as the half was being completed, was let loose cutting the corner into the lane, with the winner following suit shortly afterwards, failed to keep
pace with MO DIDDLEY from the eighth pole onward, stayed on well to secure second. PSYCHIC ENERGY underwent a three wide pursuit, turned into the
stretch then mustered up a mild response that was sufficient enough to nail down the show award. WE SHOULD TALK gradually made his way to the rail on
the backstretch, getting there by the half mile pole, stayed put during the run around the bend, tipped out into path two entering the stretch, failed to fire
appreciably. FIVE STAR BUNT contested the pace from path two, vying from between the first two finishers from midpoint on the turn to upper stretch, gave
way. WHAT A CATCH strung out four wide on the turn, was one path farther off the rail heading into the lane, never made his presence felt. MANIFEST
DESTINY two wide stepping onto the turn, was angled four wide exiting it, gave way. SARATOGA GIRO hung out in path four travelling on the turn, took a
six wide stroll into the lane, then was allowed to fade away.

Footnotes
MIND CONTROL broke in line with STILL HAVING FUN, cut over into the two path proceeding on the backstretch, was hooked up with STILL HAVING FUN
for control, was still directly abreast of that foe as they spun into the lane, settled in at the three-sixteenths pole and was given his cue, responded, poking a
head in front by the start of the final furlong, edged away from the nemesis during the next sixteenth, had no sooner done so when pounced upon by
another twosome to his outside, refused to yield, came out a bit after some left side stick work in the final stages, crossing over onto the inner border of the
path being taken by AMERICAN ANTHEM at the time, leading its pilot to grab hold, dug in gamely to preserve the decision. NICODEMUS steadied on the
chute as another was being maneuvered towards the inside, got going again in short order, departed the backstretch from the three path, was patiently
ridden stalking the front runners, angled five wide for the drive home, kicked into his best stride in midlane, rallied in tandem with SUNNY RIDGE, vied with
vigour between foes from the sixteenth pole onward, got denied. SUNNY RIDGE took up the chase from the two path, got sent out six wide entering the
stretch for optimal clearance, straightened away and began to close in on the ones to catch, loomed boldly, as did the second place finisher with
approximately a sixteenth to go, fought outside the top twosome from that juncture to the end with willingness, came up short. AMERICAN ANTHEM tracked
the pace from along the inside route, drafted in traffic from late on the bend to upper stretch, knifed its way into the three path and thus into a usable one in
the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, kept pace with the front runners, was then steadied in deep stretch after having its path partially shut down by
the winner. STILL HAVING FUN vied with the winner beginning from the shadow of the starting gate, participating in it mostly from the inside route, was put
to a drive for the drive home, saw the top one take over after completing the run through the furlong grounds, battled onward for another sixteenth before
weakening. T LOVES A FIGHT chased the pace from the three path, commenced the stretch one wider, gave way. BON RAISON four wide entering the
turn, was moved into the path five exiting it, had no offering and backed away. Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the stretch run, the result was
allowed to stand and the race was declared official.
