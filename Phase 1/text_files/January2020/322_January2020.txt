Footnotes
THE OTHER BREEZE saved ground to far turn, rallied to split hoses and exploded home while all out. RIO BUENO raced evenly to quarter pole, three wide
run to a late lead but was outfinished to the wire. GLIDING ALONE never far back to far turn, five wide run out of turn for show. MYSTIC TIGER caught in
tight first turn, checked with no late run when needed. JINGLE ME THIS unhurried early, advanced widest into stretch, cutting the margin mildly. LIZZY'S
LURE good speed with the pace to quarter pole, flattened out in drive. THE MOMENT IS NOW good speed to duel for a half, stayed well to quarter pole,
empty. ROAD TO CAIRO broke outwards at the start and never a factor. SEVENHEARTSWARRIOR never a menace. KID PERFECT speed to the front,
dueled at the half, kicked clear turn, folded.

Footnotes
UNVEILING rushed inside, close up to turn, angled out quarter pole with a mad rush to get there in time. SHORELY just off leader to stretch, took over, late
cleared but nosed on the wire. TOOTHPIC speed to the front, dug in gamely stretch but weakened late. HIGH ABOVE bothered at the start with, no speed
and only improved position in the drive. BRILLIANT BOY never far back outside, never had the late kick needed in stretch. THORPE D'ORO trailed early on
with a steady improvement while no real threat. SMOKE MONSTER never a real threat. NUMBERS NEVER LIE always outrun. READY'S MISSION
pinballed at the start, slammed hard, rushed, nothing left. TIO CHUY bounced around start, rushed quickly, gave way readily.

Footnotes
LO'S JOURNEY trailed the field early on, was on the inside into the lane, rallied in the stretch and was just up from the inside in the final stages. SHAKES
CREEK set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, remained clear in the stretch but was ran down and caught at the wire. TOBACCO ROAD came in
at the start, stalked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. GO NAVY GO chased the pace early, was in the three
path into the lane and leveled off in the stretch drive. TIMES SQUARE bothered foe in the stretch. BOURBON TRAFFIC was bothered in the stretch.
AMMUNITION was never a factor. JUNKET was done early. EL AHIJADO had early speed then folded up. UNITED STAND was bumped at the start and
stopped to a walk. Due to a timer malfunction the mile fraction is unavailable.
