Footnotes
DIXIE DOO RUN RUN away quickly from the outside then stalked the top pair, bid three deep on the turn and into the stretch, gained command nearing the
sixteenth pole and drew away. DUTT BART traveled outside a rival on the backstretch then between foes into the turn, swung out entering the stretch,
closed from the outside and edged BALLY CASTLE for the place. BALLYCASTLE sandwiched between rivals in the beginning, dueled from the outside into
and around the turn, lost the lead prior to the sixteenth pole and was outfinished for the second. BRAVE COURT broke out and bumped rival away from the
gate, dueled from the inside to the stretch and weakened in the late stages. BAJA WARRIOR chased from the inside to the lane, lacked room and steadied
just past the sixteenth pole and was ridden out to the wire. CANADIAN WARRIOR bumped at the start, unhurried up the backstretch while off the rail, exited
the turn four wide then drifted inward in the stretch and proved never threatened.

Footnotes
SAN GIORGIO chased outside the leader to the turn, floated out by unmounted rival on the turn, altered back inside and entered the stretch three wide, bid
between rivals a sixteenth out and surged clear under right-handed urging. SEATTLE ENCOUNTER stalked off the rail, angled in and saved ground around
the turn, bid from the inside and gained the lead near the sixteenth pole but was outkicked by the winner. MR BINGLEY settled off the rail, outside a rival
into the turn, angled in and cut the corner into the stretch, showed a mild response to urging but lacked room along the inside late. YES I'M WILD set the
pace up the backstretch, traveled a bit off the rail on the turn, drifted out leaving the turn and bumped the unseated rival at the top of the lane then
weakened in the late stages. RADIO TIM raced outside a rival in the early going, three wide around the turn and never threatened. HYDROSTATIC
stumbled badly and lost rider at the start. The Stewards conducted a review into the start of HYDROSTATIC and ruled that he stumbled and lost the rider at
the start by his own doing and would be no change. Due to the unseated entrant crossing first into the stretch and also the wire, the final time was
hand-timed and no half-mile fraction was recorded. The opening quarter fraction was electronically timed.
