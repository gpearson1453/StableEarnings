Footnotes
ALLURING ACTOR sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and won under strong urging. PICKETT pressed the pace, made a bid around the turn,
couldn't catch ALLURING ACTOR for the win, but held off SEE CARLOS RUN for second. SEE CARLOS RUN was an early factor, forwardly placed
throughout and was outfinished for second. WAYFARING STRANGER raced in the middle of the field, put forth an even effort and lacked a late rally. SUCH
void of early speed, moved up, but was no factor. CLASSIC GREELEY raced evenly near the back and showed little. PAT ME DOWN raced within
contention, pressing the leaders and faded. DRAKKAR lacked early speed, dropped to the rear and was outrun.

Footnotes
EBRIO went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and won under steady urging. CAJUN DUDE pressed the pace, forward throughout and followed the
winner to the wire. MOSTLY SUNNY was an early factor, saved ground around the final turn and proved no match for the top two. LANDONESE lacked
early speed, made a mild bid, but was no factor. ABSOLUT NEWORLEANS raced within contention, weakened and finished evenly. PERSONAL
CONFLICT raced in the back of the pack and was never a threat. WATCHOUTFOR TAYLOR void of early speed and showed little. RICKY DALE raced
near the middle of the field, made a bid and quickly dropped back. TEXICAN raced within contention and quickly retreated to the back.

Footnotes
MR RED SENSATION vied for the early lead, saved ground, dueled down the stretch with DIXIE BEAT and was just up for the win. DIXIE BEAT challenged
for the early lead, raced close throughout, dueled down the stretch, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. THEBOYZDELIGHT broke out,
bumped rival, pressed the early pace, eased back, made a late bid, proved no match for the top two, but got up for the show. STEPPIN' OUTONHER was
bumped at the start, raced evenly near the back, made a late bid and missed third. FIDDLERS FAREWELL bumped at the start, raced within contention,
came around the turn four wide and lacked a late rally. MARS CURIOSITY lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn, moved up, but was no factor.
SO SORRY RUSTON void of early speed, came around the turn wide, improved position, five wide, but was no threat. SPA SHACKALACKA dueled on the
front end and was finished early. BLACK JUSTICE raced near the middle of the pack and dropped back. RUN AWAY RALPH always raced near the back
and showed little.

the front, drove clear, weakened around the final turn and lacked a finish. JOKERS QUEEN raced in the back of the field in the early part, made a late gain,
but was no factor. SILVER'S SWAN SONG vied for the early lead and faded. PROMISE TENDER raced within striking distance, saved ground around the
