Footnotes
JACKS ZEN was reserved just off the leaders early, advanced four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and steadily drew
off. MOVE IT MISTER sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch but could not
match strides with the winner late. JEDI WARRIOR lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn and finished evenly in the drive. RITZY RACER
settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed late response. GERDA'S GONE was away in good order to
chase the pace of MOVE IT MISTER while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. WILDCAT LAUGH raced off the pacesetters early, moved
four-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. MALUSITA'S HOME settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and did not
offer a bid. AWESOME LOGAN raced four-wide through the first turn, lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn and was not a factor.
WISHFUL SLIM was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
SOPHIA SAID WHAT set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear lead nearing the three-eighths pole and was ridden out to the wire to be
kept to task. REVENOOR WOMAN hopped at the start, raced unhurried early, advanced five-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive
but was clearly second best. FIERY LUCK settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished
willingly. BABY ROCKS raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. LADY BLUSH was away in good order to
press the pace of the winner while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. REBEL RYETTE lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn,
angled out further into the stretch and did not menace. IRON TUFF broke sharply then raced off the leaders from the inside throughout and failed to rally.
PRAIRIE CACTUS pressed the pace from the inside for three furlongs and weakened. WHODATISAYWHODAT was void of early speed, raced three-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. DANI'S CAT was checked at the start and lagged throughout.

Footnotes
LEADING PROSPECT broke sharply to press the pace from between rivals, angled out nearing the three-eighths pole, reached the fore with a furlong to run
and drew clear. TEF'S ORDEAL pressed the pace of DANDY DON WHO from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied with
that rival but could not match strides with the winner in the drive. CHACHAS SPECIAL lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with
good late energy. DANDY DON WHO was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong.
DANI'S CHOICE raced off the leaders from the inside and finished evenly in the drive. DOM JUAN settled off the leaders from between foes, moved
three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. YOU AND WHO was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually gave way.
SOARING CID was void of early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SUNDAY SHRIMP raced off the leaders throughout and
gradually weakened. FANCY STRIPE lagged, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.
