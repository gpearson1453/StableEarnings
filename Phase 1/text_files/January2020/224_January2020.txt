Footnotes
SUPER WICKED CHARM bumped with BAY BURNER in the shadow of the starting gate, was sighted pulling on the bit heading for the end of the
homestretch as the rather pedestrian initial fraction was being set, went about better from path two soon afterwards, was switched over to vigorous
encouragement at the top of the second bend, tucked along the inside route at the three-eighths pole, went on to cut the corner into the lane under a drive,
ground his way towards the ones to catch, getting up at the end. LIGHTNING ROB strung out three wide on both turns, got asked to pick it at the midway
point of the second one, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, narrowed in, missed. LITTLE MAZZY cemented itself to a forward position after
appearing to come away in good order, was rated along attending the pace from the two path, got turned loose entering the stretch as was the pacesetter,
fought his way to a slim lead with under an eighth to go, dug in, but was caught nevertheless. TIMING broke a length the tardiest, moved inward and
underwent a three wide pursuit, was asked for run for the drive home, fanned out into path five from upper to midlane, inched up, fell short. NOW AND
AGAIN established the top after making contact with BAY BURNER, got guided over to the inside, showed the way,tailed by LITTLE MAZZY from the
outside, got roused spinning into the lane, came under heavy pressure, relinquished inside the eighth pole and weakened. BAY BURNER bobbled while
being bumped from both sides at the start, chased the pace three wide for the opening six furlongs, shifted into the path two at the three-eighths pole, got
swung out five wide for the drive home, came up empty. IHADADREAM remained stationed along the inside route at the start, got checked while appearing
keen during the opening phases, didn't really settle down to a more professional mode until approximately midway on the backstretch, fell back in a
steadfast manner, was set down stepping into the lane, faltered.

Footnotes
SISTER ALEXA three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, remained patiently handled through the turn and cut the
corner into upper stretch, got roused straightened away, rallied, tipping out a path near the eighth pole, took over command inside that station and drew
clear to the finish kept to task. FIRST DAWN four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive and was up for the place honors among a blanket finish for minor spoils. ITS A CHANCE coaxed from the gate, dueled early on to the
inside of KINKY SOX, took over sole command and shook away through the turn, spun along the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was
collared inside the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages and just preserved the show honors on the wire. CAUSIN' TROUBLE chased two to three wide
from the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. BARBARA P chased three
to four wide coming under light coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, advanced on the turn into contention spinning four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the
late going. MARRIAGE five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
spun three wide for home, weakened in the final eighth. EIGHT OAKS chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, continued just off the
inside for home, tired in the drive. KINKY SOX dueled from the three path early on with ITS A CHANCE to her inside, got displaced and shaken off into and
through the turn, came under urging near the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide for home in retreat and folded in the stretch.

into the lane, built up the advantage to its biggest ridden out over the course of the next furlong, left the eighth pole under a drive, saw the runner up close
in, but held sway. OK HONEY pursued the pace from path two after making contact with each of her next stall neighbors, began to angle to the outside
springing from the five-sixteenths pole, wound up approximately five wide a furlong later, narrowed in, bested DOVEY LOVEY for place honors. DOVEY
LOVEY taken hold after bobbling and being bumped from both sides at the start, chased the pace from the two path, going about its business in between
foes, got turned loose late on the bend, began the last eighth free from foes on either side, lost second. STAY SMART bumped with two others after
stumbling the start, settled into the three path, commenced the stretch by tipping one wider, made no late headway. COLOR CHART unscathed at the
break, prompted the pace two wide for a half and gave way. FLOSS DANCER came out at the start, made contact with the second place finisher before
being corrected, went on to track the front runners from the pocket, was already being roused prior to the quarter pole, faltered. PARTY IN THE SAND
bumped shortly after the field had been sent off and running, travelled four wide on the turn, got sent out into path six from upper to midstretch, venturing
onward as the widest of all, had no rally.

Footnotes
KANSAS KIS coaxed lightly from the gate, tracked the pace just off the inside in aim of the front, got placed to a firmer hold off heels of the leader near the
half mile pole and pulled on the bit a tad headstrong into the turn before settling once in the bend, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six
wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command seventy yards from home, then inched clear to the finish to
prevail. FRENCH CAFE showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung
two to three wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and was caught seventy yards from home while well clear of the
rest to be along second best. MAMA KIN four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and
weakened while along for the show honors. TALE OF PERFECT LA chased two to three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and offered no response. TOASTNJAM prompted the pace from the outside three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
went five wide for home and weakened. HENNI PENNY chased three to four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper
stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
FIRST DEPUTY tracked the front runners from just off the rail, slipped to the outside leaving the five-sixteenths pole, lugged in momentarily challenging
three wide a furlong down the road, emerged at the beginning of the final furlong as the new leader, kicked well clear. HIM SHE KISSES disputed the pace
from the two path, departed the bend, vied for the top during the ensuing furlong from between opponents, saw the winner take over, held on well to secure
second. MISSION WRAPITUP left the post parade early, proceeded to stumble as the field was sent off and running, assumed a forward position, was on
the inside route contending with the runner up for control, saw the winner increase his presence by the head of the stretch, igniting a three-way tussle for the
top, kept at it for about another furlong before relinquishing for good and backing away. HOLD MY CALL travelled three to four wide on the turn, angled into
path five for clearance early during the stretch drive, lacked the needed response. ARIESBERG three wide stepping onto the turn, was sent into the four
path exiting it, gave way.

Footnotes
THE GREAT JOHANNA got going after some coaxing on the chute, inched her way into the two path, loosely drafted behind the runner up, picked up
interest splitting opponents at the five-sixteenths pole, moved to the outside, settled in towards path four at the head of the stretch and was soon given its
cue, took charge during the rest of the run leading up to the inside route, ventured onward for a few additional strides, before becoming geared down,
completed the final sixteenth best described as handily. DIAMOND N SIMON cut over into the two path after the start, showed the way feeling some
pressure, saw the winner increase her presence as three-quarters was being rattled off, got called upon, proved no match, held on to fend off FIGHT ON
LUCY for place honors. FIGHT ON LUCY underwent a ground-saving journey, stepped into the lane, narrowed in on DIAMOND N SIMON, just fell short of
snatching away second. GILDA MARIE strung out four wide on the turn, went about wide into the lane, lacked a solid closing punch. A BRIDGE TOO FAR
kept watch on the front runners from just off the rail, got roused after crossing midpoint on the turn, tipped into the two path heading home, got outfinished.
MY LAST MILLION four wide entering the turn, angled five wide leaving it, failed to menace. SUMMER FANTASY pressed the issue from the three path,
was already being asked for more by the five-sixteenths pole, gave way.

Footnotes
HONEY GRAEME lunged slightly at the break, crossed to the inside and dueled from the two path with LINDA'S BALLET to her inside, remained patiently
handled until set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in knocking heads through to the finish and prevailed gamely at the end. LINDA'S
BALLET crossed to the inside shortly after the start and dueled to the inside of the aforementioned foe from the get go coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in fighting on gamely head to head to the finish but was ultimately denied. SKY VISION chased just off
the inside down the backstretch and then along the inside through the turn just off the duel coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside for home and ran on to secure the show honors. COTTON CANDY CUTIE three wide in aim of the duel up front, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and kept on for the last major share. JUDGEMENT FREE coaxed from the start, chased three to
four wide under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered no response. SARATOGA STYLE chased along the inside
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, offered no rally. COBRA SOPHIE got bumped at the start by PRINCESS
MIKAYAH, who broke outwards, chased three to four wide down the backstretch, briefly tucked to the two path into the turn before darting three wide
nearing the three-eighths placed to coaxing, got floated four wide at that station as PRINCESS MIKAYAH floated out a path from the inside, went five to six
wide into upper stretch and tired. PRINCESS MIKAYAH broke out at the start bumping the aforementioned foe, chased just off the inside, floated three wide
at the three-eighths placed to coaxing carrying COBRA SOPHIE four wide at that station, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. GOBI coaxed from
the gate, chased five then four wide under a ride from three furlongs out, went three to four wide for home and trailed.
