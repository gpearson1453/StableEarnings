Footnotes
CAJUN CASH went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and finished well. CHRONIQUEUR unhurried in the early part, moved up, racing four wide
around the final turn, couldn't catch the leader, but was a clear second. THUNDER AND RAIN raced within striking distance, came around the first turn five
wide, forwardly placed throughout, but lacked a late kick. KING FORMEREDITH raced within contention, made a bid and hung down the home stretch.
SAVED AT SEA void of early speed, racing in the rear, moved up, but was no factor. SECOND GUESS always raced near the back and was never a threat.
OPPORTUNITY COST raced in the middle of the field, moved up down the backside and made a steady retreat. BLUE HOUDINI pressed the early pace
and stopped.

OUR AMEN lacked early speed, racing in the back, moved up down the backside, waited around the final turn, blocked, angled out, four wide, rallied and
was going away at the end. CORRECT ANSWER vied for the early advantage, drove clear around the second turn, while saving ground, but couldn't match
strides with the winner late. CRIDER CHASE raced within contention, eased back, made a late bid after turning for home, but proved no match for the top
two. LAURALEE COCODREE raced in the middle of the pack, made a bid and hung, getting outfinished for third. CLYTEE void of early speed, moved up,
but was no factor. MIGHTY PEGASUS raced near the middle of the pack and faded. ROYAL DANZA dueled for the early lead, saved ground and stopped.

Footnotes
MIMI'S SONG challenged for the early lead, saved ground, drove clear and finished well, while being kept to the task. RUNNING UNBRIDLED pressed the
pace, saved ground around the turn, couldn't catch the winner, but was a clear second. MINTAPPEARENCE brushed at the start, racing in the back, made
a steady gain and finished willingly. JOLIE GEE pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late kick. TERRI'S TEMPER raced within
striking distance, came around the turn three wide and finished evenly. DIXIE FOREST dueled for the early lead and faded. BREW CASA raced evenly near
the back and was never a threat. HEART OF SOUL brushed at the start, raced in the middle of the field and weakened. HONEST VICTORY raced in the
middle of the pack, came around the turn four wide and faded. PALEEZE always raced in the back, came around the turn wide and showed little.

near the back, moved up five wide around the final turn, rallied down the stretch and was a clear second at the wire. UNCLE BIRD raced within striking
distance, saved ground around the second turn, made a bid, but couldn't match strides late with the top two. NO PLANS broke poorly, racing in the rear,
gained ground and was outfinished for third. DUE APEAL lacked early speed, showed late interest, while racing wide, but was no factor. SPRING RODEO
raced near the back in the beginning, moved up to the middle of the pack and hung. PERSONAL CONFLICT raced in the middle of the field and weakened.
WATCHOUTFOR TAYLOR was an early factor and finished early. ABSOLUT NEWORLEANS pressed the early pace and dropped back. VALID

FRIENDLY AND KIND pressed the pace, took command around the final turn, pulled away and finished well. KINLEY CASH went to the front, drove clear,
moved to the rail, forwardly placed throughout, couldn't keep up with the winner, but held on for second. SEVENEIGHTNINE raced in the middle of the field,
came around the first turn four wide, made a late bid and was outfinished for second. SPANISH ARCH raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, made
a late gain, but was no factor. SILVER'S SWAN SONG raced near the middle of the field and finished evenly. TAMARIU lacked early speed, finished inside
and passed tired ones. PROMISE TENDER raced within contention and faded. RED FERN DOLL raced near the back and showed little. FOREST GIRL
pressed the early pace and stopped.
