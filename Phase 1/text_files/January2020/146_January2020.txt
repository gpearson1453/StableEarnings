Footnotes
BIG SKY LOGAN saved ground, assumed command along the rail on the backstretch, drew away for a clear lead and held safely while kept to task.
MONUMENTAL SEVEN was never far back, rallied around the second turn, bid five wide, couldn't gain ground and got up for place. THRASHER was
unhurried early, got through along the rail on the turn, bid, hung and drifted late. ITS A BOY was unhurried early, went seven wide entering the stretch and
offered a mild bid only. COOL HAND LUCAS was steadied on the second turn, lacked room in the upper stretch and failed to rally once clear. DIECI showed
speed to the second turn, fell back and faded through the stretch. THIRTY SECONDS OUT settled off the pace, took command along the inside on the
backstretch, led briefly, tired on the turn and gave way. TERYN IT UP was outrun in an even effort and not urged late. MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE failed to
contend. BRAVE HELIOS set the pace, bore out badly, stopped and was not urged late.

save ground and lacked a late rally. UNLEASH THE BEAST bumped at the start, bid inside on the turn, loomed a threat and hung. WISE MARKET was not

Footnotes
MESA SKYLINE advanced inside along the backstretch, awaited room on the turn, angled out, bid willingly, dueled for the lead and inched away late to
prove best. PINE GROVE ROAD held a good position, assumed command three across entering the turn, drew clear, responded to duel and was
outfinished in a game effort. BUYMEABOND angled out at the top of the stretch, bid six wide, couldn't gain ground and settled for show. REAL LUTE was
unhurried early, went seven wide entering the stretch, closed well and didn't have enough late to threaten. SIX POINT RACK raced mid pack, bid and came
up empty. WATER WAGON was rated back at the start and improved position in an even effort. FRANKIE MACHINE was sent to the front to set the pace to
the second turn, tired and gave way. OLD SCHOOL IKE was through early. CHASKA was through after a half. PULPITS POWER was also through after a
half. HANDSOME JOHN pressed the pace, challenged for the lead into the second turn, tired and stopped.
