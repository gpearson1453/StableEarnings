Footnotes
JACKS OUTLAW bumped at the start, moved up along the backstretch to vie two across and drew off near the sixteenth pole under left handed urging.
DOUBLE ONE SHOT was a bit washy in the post parade, got away well to set the pace around the first turn, vied inside, yielded near the sixteenth pole and
held safely for place. YHA YHA saved ground, angled out at the top of the stretch and offered a mild bid to get up for show. RED CHOCOLATE was never
far off the pace, rallied into the second turn to get within striking distance and came up empty in the drive. SHOWEM APOLLO bumped and was crowded at
the start, steadied slightly entering the first turn, saved ground and lacked a response. THE FIDDLERS GREEN bumped at the start and did not threaten in
an even effort.

PURELY POLITICAL bumped at the start, was never far of the pace while racing outside, rallied four wide on the turn to challenge, inched clear mid stretch
and held off the late charge of UNLEASH THE TIGER. UNLEASH THE TIGER led early, was rated back inside, got boxed in to the turn, angled out once
clear, bid six wide and was gaining ground. ME was never far back, put in a steady effort and was along for show. BEVOLUTION assumed command on the
first turn, set a pressured pace to the second turn and faltered near the eighth pole. COLORADO CANDY pressed the pace to the second turn, tired and
gave way. I'LL TAKE YOU OUT was void of early speed, bid inside and came up empty. GIANT WATCH bumped at the start, was pulled up and vanned off.

LAYLA'S WILDCAT challenged three across on the turn, dueled to late stretch and drew off under urging. CHATTIN WITH JENNY saved ground,
challenged for the lead along the inside leaving the turn, dueled to late stretch, was no match and settled for place. LIL JESSIE set the pace to the turn,
responded to duel, faltered mid stretch, dropped back and was clearly best of the rest. I AM THE STORM was not a factor. DATCAT was never far back,
lacked a stretch response and dropped back. ARRIVEDERCI AMORE had brief speed only.

Footnotes
PERFECTLY SEASONED set the pace, was under pressure in the drive and held on gamely. DAWNS MORNING broke awkwardly, saved ground while
unhurried early, advanced to the turn, bid inside to threaten, couldn't get by the winner and was outfinished in a good effort. MISS WINE TOPPER pressed
the pace, went five wide leaving the turn, closed steadily and narrowed the gap. MARIA was never far back, raced outside, went eight wide at the top of the
stretch and closed well. JAZZ NIGHT pressed the pace, went six wide leaving the turn and lacked the needed late response. EZ GIRL was fanned five wide
on the first turn and did not threaten in an even effort. BIG JOSIE trailed the field.

Footnotes
WILLIAM CROTTY was reluctant to load, stumbled at the start while getting away well, raced close to the pace, moved up to challenge three across, inched
away mid stretch and held well. GOLD TREASURE raced in close, challenged between horses on the turn, was outclosed and just lasted for place. WE'RE
JUST SAYIN was crowded at the start, raced in the back, was in tight entering the far turn, bid nine wide, was gaining late and got up at the wire for show.
SHACKLEFORD BANKS bumped at the start, was unhurried early, rallied around the turn, bid eight wide to threaten, didn't have enough late and was
caught for third. PERCY FAWCETT set the pace, responded when challenged to duel, yielded inside the sixteenth pole and lost position. CLASSY COVE
was never far off the pace and failed to menace in an even effort. CEDAR RAPIDS was unhurried early, raced far back, closed well and was not a threat.
MUSIC GIANT bumped at the start and was outrun. CASH REWARD saved ground, lacked a bid and was outrun.

REMEMBERTOBREATHE stalked the pace while racing outside, challenged three across, dueled to late stretch and inched away to prove best. JONNY'S
CHOICE set the early pace, vied inside, dueled through the stretch and yielded late to finish second best. WHOA BOY moved up on the backstretch to vie,
dueled between horses, was taken back past the eighth pole, altered course and lost momentum. DEPUTY'S COMMAND was unhurried early, went eight
wide at the top of the stretch and closed well. BAY AREA raced mid pack, went six wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. FREDDIES DREAM hesitated at
the start to be off slowly and failed to menace in an even effort. CALL IT LUKE was not a factor. ALLEN'S CROWN stalked inside to the second turn, tired
and gave way.

Footnotes
DRAYMAGIC dueled for the lead, drew off into the turn for a clear lead and held well under steady urging. GIMME SOME SLACK pressed the pace, awaited
room on the turn, bid inside and closed steadily to earn place. KALEIDOSCOPE KID was steadied at the start, was unhurried early and raced in the back,
advanced to the turn, couldn't get through along the inside, angled out, bid ten wide and closed willingly to get up late for show. MY WAY OUT pressed the
pace while racing inside, fell back on the second turn, shifted out, continued willingly to the wire and was caught for third. BLUE JEANS N BEER raced in
the back, went nine wide entering the stretch and lacked the needed rally. CHELOKEE'S LEGACY raced mid pack, lacked a stretch response and was not
urged late. J SERINO dueled two across, dropped back entering the turn, and steadily faded. Hand timed.
