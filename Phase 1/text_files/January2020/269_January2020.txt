Footnotes
JAX MAN was hustled from the start, bumped with SECRET REDEMPTION when that foe angled into him early, was taken up then moved to the outside of
the aforementioned rival, tracked on the outside, went two to three wide on the turn, made a bid at the quarter-pole, took over in upper stretch, shook clear
under a strong hand ride into the final furlong then was put to a left-handed whip, drifted out some while drawing away approaching the sixteenth-pole then
was placed under a hand ride while much the best. SECRET REDEMPTION angled in quickly after the start and bumped JAX MAN, set the clear pace as
the aforementioned foe was forced to take up, raced inside to the two path on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead in upper stretch,
dropped back into the final furlong and proved no match for the winner while well clear for the place. SILVER GALAXY reared at the start and was off very
slow, spotted the front many lengths, angled in at the rear of the field, took an awkward stride against the rail leaving the backstretch, shifted three wide
early on the turn then swerved five wide around the three-eighths, altered out six wide after being near the heels of a foe just inside the five-sixteenths,
turned into upper stretch under a drive, drifted out some in the final furlong and lacked the needed response while up for the show. MY TY FU PEG was
urged along on the outside, went four wide for most of the turn, shifted five wide when BARROW ROAD came out at the five-sixteenths and made light
contact, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong, drifted out some at that point, exchanged bumps with BARROW ROAD near the sixteenth-pole
and narrowly beat that foe for the last spot in the superfecta. BARROW ROAD broke a half-step slow, settled under some urging, raced in the two path early
on the turn, shifted abruptly three wide at the five-sixteenths then made light contact with a foe, turned into the stretch under the whip, drifted out near the
furlong marker, exchanged bumps with MY TY FU PEG near the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten while just missing the superfecta.
PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN settled well back on the outside, went four wide early on the turn then was carried six wide, dropped to the five path near the
five-sixteenths, moved to the two path while dropping back nearing the quarter-pole and failed to respond.

Footnotes
EATORBEEATEN went straight to the front, set the clear pace in the two path, was asked at the quarter-pole, responded well under the whip while
remaining on his inside lead in the stretch, had the rider switched sticks two times in the process and held under strong urging. CREOLE CANDY broke out
but was quickly corrected by the rider, went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, was urged along while three to four wide on the far
turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained into the final furlong and finished with good energy while moving in late to get the place. RELUCTANT
WARRIOR went four to five wide on the first turn, settled towards the front on the outside, tracked the leader while three wide on the far turn, was asked
inside the three-eighths, chased four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and was out-kicked then lost the place late while well clear for the
show. IBEAM went four wide on the first turn, settled near the middle of the field, advanced four wide under urging on the far turn, was driven six wide into
upper stretch and lacked the needed response. LES PAUL was taken back early then angled out into the first turn, went five wide on that bend, settled near
the back on the outside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, went five wide while hard ridden on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip
and failed to threaten. OUR BERMUDA went three wide on the first turn, settled in the front half of the field, was urged along while two to three wide on the
far turn, floated six wide into upper stretch and failed to respond. BING BING broke out then was corrected by the rider, went three wide on the first turn,
tracked the pace, was put to urging inside the five-eighths, came up empty under strong urging on the far turn and retreated.

Footnotes
GUITAR KING settled off the leading pair tracking those rivals three then two wide on the first turn, edged closer up the backstretch outside CHEAP SHOT
who began to shift inward into the far turn, was joined by an outside rival and bid between foes two to three deep on the far turn taking a narrow lead near
the five-sixteenths, responded to urging and edged clear into mid-stretch and held sway. TUNE MY GUITAR raced outside a rival in the three path into the
first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch racing about two to three deep, encouraged along late on the far turn still trailing and having gone in the two to
three path on that bend, came out through mid-stretch and showed late effort to get up for place inside SILENT CRY, who was outside foes off the leaders
four deep through the first turn gradually dropping back and racing outside rivals three wide early on the far turn, given some encouragement and began to
edge closer four wide out of that bend, came out a bit wider for the drive and was closer in upper stretch but evened out and lost the place late. EL
HOMBRE broke outwardly just a bit, was midpack two to three wide between foes into the first turn, under just mild coaxing advanced up the backstretch
outside foes three to four wide, continued four wide on the far turn making a mild bid near the five-sixteenths but could not sustain the effort and levelled off.
QUISTY BOY came in just a bit at the start, was keen to go on from the rail into the first turn inside a foe, continued under mild restraint early up the
backstretch before easing back and switching out near the three-eighths pole, went in behind the leading trio from the two to three path on the far turn then
lacked the needed late kick to threaten in the lane. STRIKING STAR tracked inside just off the leaders early, was guided off the inside in the vicinity of the
five-eighths pole, edged just a tad closer four wide into the far turn moving out five wide by the late part of that bend, gave way in the stretch. CHEAP SHOT
pressed the pace from the outside, edged away to dictate terms two wide up the backstretch, shifted in entering the far turn and was joined by outside foes
at that juncture, vied with those to upper stretch then faded through the stretch while not persevered with late. I DON'T FLY COACH broke a half-step
slowly, saved ground early, continued along the inside into the far turn and was never a threat.

Footnotes
LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN went five wide on the first turn, moved up early on the backstretch to take the lead went clear outside the half-mile pole, extended
the advantage leaving the backstretch, drew off in the two path on the far turn, was put to the whip outside the furlong marker and maintained a safe
advantage under steady urging. MY PEPPER ANN went four wide into the first turn then dropped to the three path, settled near the middle of the field,
started the far turn in the two path then shifted four wide under urging, turned into the stretch under the whip, pursued the winner while remaining on her
inside lead in the drive, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly for the place. AIR GUITAR STAR broke out a bit at the start, went four wide
on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along while five then six wide on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and lacked the needed
response while best of the rest. ELLE CORREDORA was last to commence, went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was urged along
while four wide on the far turn, drifted in outside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. GIO ANGEL went three wide on the first turn, was well placed in
third position, raced three wide under urging on the far turn and came up empty. BORN TO D' WILD left the gate with great haste, set the pace while inside
to the two path, lost the lead early on the backstretch, dropped back leaving the backstretch and stopped. FRONT MONEY MORGAN was hustled from the
start, moved from four to six wide on the first turn, settled on the far outside, dropped back while five wide on the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
WHATDATPAY RAY settled at the rear along the inside, came off the fence to advance in the two then three path on the far turn, found room in upper
stretch, drifted out under left-handed urging then back in having switched to right-handed encouragement but kept to task and edged past late.
CALIMAMBO was bumped lightly into an outside rival at the start, raced forwardly three wide between foes into the first turn shifting in two wide then to the
rail coming out of that bend vying inside a foe, settled into stride easing back off that one up the backstretch, switched out near the three-eighths to
commence a bid two to three wide between rivals on the far turn edging clear past the five-sixteenths, was clear into upper stretch while drifting in then
drifted out under left-handed urging late and was outfinished. UNRESTRICTED was bumped into the outside foe at the start, raced between foes into the
first turn then eased back from the outside rivals content to track those three wide entering the backstretch, switched out near the half-mile marker, went five
wide on the far turn, shifted in a bit in upper stretch then drifted around a bit in mid- to late-stretch while running on to annex show honors. THE MO U NO
was floated five wide into the first turn coming in a bit to be four deep the remainder of that turn, continued racing outside a foe four wide up the backstretch,
edged closer four wide heading to the far turn coming out a further path and losing some ground early on that bend, ran on without threatening late. BIG
BOY DAVE REX was brushed just after the break then taken up when in tight quarters about five wide headed into the first turn, shifted in gradually on that
bend to be about two deep midway through, raced last but one up the backstretch losing ground and dropping back to last by the far turn and having
switched out a bit into that bend, went in the three to four path and improved position in the lane. COSTA ALOT bumped the outside rival at the start, raced
inside foes into the first turn coming out a path past the midpoint of that bend, switched out further having reached the backstretch and edged closer into the
far turn, was within striking distance four wide on that turn, lugged out in upper stretch and came up empty. THREE RUN HOMER was bumped lightly at the
start then brushed with the outside foe soon after, caught four wide into the first turn shift in three then two deep by the end of that bend to set the pace
outside a rival up the backstretch, cleared and shifted in entering the far turn, was overtaken midway on that bend then gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
IRRITATOR set the early pace in the clear racing well off the fence, shifted in leaving the backstretch and was overtaken by an outside rival, saved ground
through the turn before switching out four wide in upper stretch, came again under urging, drifted out under left-handed urging, struck the lead just past the
sixteenth and moved clear. BERTIE'S GALAXY was very reluctant to load, bumped around between rivals at the start, stalked outside three wide into the
turn taking the lead three furlongs out, edged clear on that bend and while asked for run still in the three path by the three-sixteenths, drifted in a bit, was
overtaken past the sixteenth pole and weakened late. LOCALLY OWNED exchanged some small bumps with the inside foe at the start, raced mid-pack in
the clear, was encouraged along chasing from the two path into the turn then quickly coming out a path then a further path near the five-sixteenths, given
more urging at that juncture coming out five wide in upper stretch, could make no headway through the final furlong but ran on evenly. METROPOL settled
last but one racing off the inside, went in the three path on the turn, was asked for more about the five-sixteenths, gained mildly in late stretch. GROVE
DADDY broke a bit slowly spotting the early leader about two lengths out of the gate, angled in soon thereafter and trailed up the backstretch, came out
leaving the far turn coming four wide into the stretch, drifted out a bit further through the lane and was not a threat. ROCK DOC came out at the start and
bumped a rival, showed brief foot between foes then continued to chase from the two path into the turn, dropped back and faded thereafter.

SPECIALLY moved up then was taken in hand while just behind the pacesetter, dropped back inside the half-mile pole, moved out into the turn, stalked four
wide on that bend, ranged up coming to the quarter-pole, cruised to the front while five wide into upper stretch, powered clear on her own while moving in,
was shaken up some with the reins from the eighth-pole to the sixteenth-pole, remained under mild hand urging in the process then was put to even less
encouragement while widening to win handily. LUCKY QUARTERS broke out at the start, angled in while moving up on the outside to press the pace, drew
even with the leader into the turn, vied outside that foe in the three path on that bend, was asked while tipping briefly closer to the four path at the
quarter-pole, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed whip near the sixteenth-pole and held the place. LITTLE RED FROG
was urged along at the rear, dropped further behind leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out
under a drive around the three-sixteenths, drifted out some in the final furlong and missed the place. CINDY'S PRAYER was sent hard from the start, sped
clear early, was challenged near the half-mile pole, vied inside to the two path on the turn, was roused approaching the quarter-pole, dropped back under a
drive in upper stretch and faded.

C'ESTBON C'ESTBON went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, set the pace through reasonable fractions, was urged along in the two path
while under threat on the far turn, responded well in the drive, shook off all comers inside the furlong marker and proved best under strong urging. G'S
DEADLINE was bumped lightly into the first turn, went five wide on the first turn, settled towards the front on the outside, was urged along passing the
half-mile pole, chased four wide on the far turn, made a bid into the stretch, battled outside of the winner into the final furlong and was outfinished while clear
for the place. MAW MAW'S SOPHIA took an awkward stride early, became keen under restraint while inside on the first turn then was rated off the pace,
dropped back late on the backstretch, was urged along while three wide early on the far turn then shifted five wide, advanced to make a brief bid on the
outside in upper stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker and weakened but was clear for the show. MADISON'S PLACE broke a step slow, bumped with
SHESAROCKSTARTOO while against the rail nearing the first turn then checked, went around the first turn in the two path, settled well off the pace, was
urged along in the two path on the far turn and failed to threaten. SHESAROCKSTARTOO bumped with MADISON'S PLACE into the first turn then came
out and bumped lightly with G'S DEADLINE, went four wide on that bend, was rated just off the pace, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied three wide
under urging on the far turn, chased into the stretch and tired. GO MY JULIET had her head turned at the start and broke a step slow, tossed her head
early, went five to six wide on the turns and showed little. GALAXY STAR broke out then was hustled, went three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace
on the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch and stopped.
