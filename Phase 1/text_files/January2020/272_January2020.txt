OUR STAR disputed the pace three to four wide outside NINE MARTINIS, was under confident handling mid turn, moved to command nearing the lane,
was roused clear past the three sixteenths then widened under a steady hand ride. WAR TWEET settled off the rail early on, came under pressure mid turn,
angled four to five wide into the lane and finished willingly to grab the place in the final yards. ORTINOLA chased the dueling leaders, was under a hearty
ride past the five sixteenths, angled to the rail in upper stretch and got the show in the final jumps. NINE MARTINIS took over early and set a pressured
pace while two to three wide, dueled inside the winner around the turn and weakened leaving mid stretch. EYE OF THE WILDCAT dropped off the pace and
failed to respond.

WILD RIVER , well off the duel down the backstretch, lacked room and steadied with run leaving the turn, swung wide in upper stretch, took command
approaching the eighth pole and drew off while kept to his business. COFFEE PLEASE stalked the duel, advanced three wide entering the stretch, bid for
the lead near the three sixteenths pole, finished willingly but was no match for the winner. YES MAN bumped with WISKY CHARLIE leaving the starting
gate, disputed the pace outside TRUMP CHANGE, weakened the final furlong and raced erratically near the sixteenth pole. CECIL THE LION , along the
rail for five furlongs, swung wide leaving the turn and was outrun. ONE REAL COWBOY , very wide turning for home was outrun. WISKY CHARLIE bumped
with YES MAN leaving the starting gate, swung wide turning for home and gave way. TRUMP CHANGE hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to mid turn,
checked approaching the stretch and dropped back.

JUSTIN FRONT broke outward, was quickly corrected and moved up in hand to take command outside ONCE IN A LIFETIME leaving the three quarter
pole, was coaxed along setting the pace two wide around the turn, kicked away after being put to a stout drive in upper stretch, kept on under strong right
handed encouragement nearing the sixteenth marker and held sway. CHASING THE CANDY prompted the pace outside the winner, moved to apply more
pressure leaving the far turn, continued willingly as the winner got away a bit near mid stretch, came back some late and saved the place. LECTRIC CHOKE
drafted back off the leaders and saved ground, was under a ride saving ground into the lane, stayed inside from there, closed steadily and just missed the
place. WALK AWAY JOE lacked speed off the rail, was under a drive circling five wide into the stretch, straightened away and had a mild rally. SAVE ME
PAULA failed to menace. BOAT OVER THE HILL lagged off the pace, saved ground into the stretch but failed to respond. ONCE IN A LIFETIME was sent
early and took a brief lead, rated back to the inside of the winner near the five eighths, steadied when appearing to want to get out, chased around the turn
and gave way.

DAH PHILLY stalked the pace, eased outside leaving the turn, drifted out near the eighth pole, gained the lead late and drove clear. SHAK'S HIDDEN GEM
advanced two wide leaving the turn, gained command entering the stretch, gave way grudgingly and her rider dropped her whip near the eighth pole.
VALIANT SPIRIT saved ground on the turn, angled out to pass R TRUE SENSATION in upper stretch, was taken back inside and failed to rally. LULU'S ON
THE MOVE was outrun. R TRUE SENSATION showed speed, gave way in upper stretch and was eased but did cross the finish line.

OFF DUTY edged up to the inside of a rival and stalked under rating, eased out around the turn, moved up between foes near mid stretch, shifted out and
closed in under left handed rousing and wore down CATONSVILLE in the final strides. CATONSVILLE set a rated pace outside rivals, moved clear past the
three eighths, was under a drive with a daylight advantage past the furlong grounds, dug in when collared past the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly.
LOOKS GOOD had speed then rated back to stalk, advanced four wide heading to the quarter pole, pursued past mid stretch but was out finished. DRIVE
AT NITE saved ground off the pace and under urging, moved off the inside nearing mid stretch, altered back in and closed willingly. GRIMGRINNIN'
GHOST broke poorly, regrouped and raced well back while saving ground, angled five wide entering the lane, straightened and closed williingly. FRENCH'S
QUEST forced the pace inside and faded. IWISHIWASPECIAL steadied when in tight at the break and failed to menace. FINBAR lacked speed, circled
rivals six wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. PARADE OF NATIONS chased off the rail, failed to kick on nearing the lane, steadied past the three
sixteenths and gave way.

DANCIE bumped ESTERINA when bearing in leaving the starting gate, disputed the pace outside TARAWA and drew out under brisk urging in the drive.
MESS'N AROUND circled the turn three wide, failed to be a menace and offered a mild gain. TARAWA hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to the
eighth pole then gave way. EIFS , steadied when bumped by ESTERINA soon after the break, saved ground on the turn and was not a factor. ESTERINA
bumped EIFS when bumped and forced in leaving the starting gate, pulled up lame in the left hind leg and was euthanized as reported by the stewards.
There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the start but no action was taken.

HIGHER PURPOSE edged clear early, set a rated pace two wide, responded when put to a stiff drive in mid stretch and held sway. LIQUID HERO stalked
the winner three wide, moved up near mid stretch, wandered outward and kept on willingly to be clear of the rest. ELUSIVE HERO lost ground four wide and
lacked a solid finish. BUST ANOTHER saved ground pursuing the winner and faded late. HIGH ROLLER broke a step slow, steadied nearing the half mile
marker, steadied off heels mid turn then came up empty.
