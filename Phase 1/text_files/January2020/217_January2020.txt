TIZ A SECRET stalked the leaders in the early part, made a bid around the final turn, drifted in at the head of the stretch, brushed KYE'S ADDYCAT, dueled
down the stretch and drove clear before the wire. KYE'S ADDYCAT went to the front, took command, forwardly placed throughout, was brushed at the head
of the home stretch, dueled down the lane and was outfinished by the winner. SAVED AT SEA hopped at the start, racing in the rear, made a steady gain,
racing four wide around the final turn and finished willingly. ELLERBE void of early speed, made a late wide bid and was outfinished for third. I'M D'CAT
raced near the middle of the field, made a mild bid, but was no factor. FREDDIESLILWILDCAT raced within contention, while saving ground and weakened.
KING FORMEREDITH pressed the early pace and was finished early. LITTLE MARIO void of early speed and was never close. ATDABARWITHMERRILL
was an early factor, racing four wide around the first turn and retreated to the rear and lost contact with the field. THE JOCKEY OF #5 KYE'S ADDYCAT
LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #3 TIZ A SECRET FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE HEAD OF THE LANE. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS

SHOT ON WINDY HILL stalked the leaders in the early part, moved up around the final turn, pulled away and won under steady urging. THE BOYZ DONE
IT raced within striking distance, moved up on the inside around the final turn, angled out, made a bid, racing four wide, proved no match for the winner, but
was a clear second. DON'T LOOK raced in the middle of the field, made a late bid and proved third best. LITTLE MAN E DUBAI dueled for the early
advantage, forwardly placed throughout, but lacked a finish. REDDING COTEAU vied for the early lead and faded. CH BERN lacked early speed, moved

Footnotes
ZENS SECRET stalked the leaders in the early part, moved up four wide around the final turn, drove clear down the stretch and won under steady urging.
EUROEAST challenged for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner late, but was best of others. PROPER
CROSS raced in the middle of the pack in the beginning, eased back, made a late gain and got up for third. LARRY DALE void of early speed, made a late
bid and was outfinished for third by PROPER CROSS. LUKE THE DRIFTER raced near the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. XIROMA dueled
for the early lead and faded. HARD STORY always raced near the back and showed little. THUNDER BOX challenged for the early lead and dropped back.
CALLMECHAMP reared at the start and was never a threat.

TAPIT BABY pressed the early pace, took command down the backside, pulled away and won handily. U NEEDA RIDE lacked early speed, moved up on
the inside around the second turn, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but was an easy second. CALLHERMRSGELNER raced within striking
distance, made a mild bid and proved third best. THIRSTYAMERICANGAL challenged for the early lead, faded and lacked a finish. FIGHT ON PENN raced
evenly near the back and was never a threat. MY LITTLE DIVA broke out, steadied and was never close. CONSPICUOUS LINE dueled on the front end and
retreated to the rear.

Footnotes
MOONFIELD unhurried in the early going, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a late bid, racing four wide and got up in time. MISS BITTERS
raced within striking distance, came around the turn three wide, made a bid down the stretch and was outfinished by MOONFIELD for the win. ATCHATA
vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for the top two. THAT'S A SONG broke out, dueled for the early lead and
weakened. TERRI'S TEMPER raced within contention, saved ground around the turn, faded and finished evenly near the back. FANCY MALLORY void of
early speed, finished wide and was never a threat. ISADORA bumped at the start, raced near the back, lost contact, distanced and walked off.

but got up for third. G CISIVE dueled for the early lead, saved ground and weakened. PRIVATE REALITY void of early speed, showed late interest, but was
no factor. NOMOREQUESTIONS raced evenly near the back in the early part, came around the final turn wide, moved up, but was no factor. KOWBOY'S
