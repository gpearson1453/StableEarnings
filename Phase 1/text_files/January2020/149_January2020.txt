Footnotes
HOT MELISSA went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace, drew off along the rail on the turn, responded well when asked for her best in upper
stretch and proved much the best under steady handling. SANDY'S WAGER was urged along towards the rear, went two to three wide on the turn, drifted in
under a drive in upper stretch and improved to get the place. OUR FOOLISH GIRL came in a bit at the start then bumped with TIZ DARBY, had that foe clip
her heels, tracked the pace on the far outside, dropped further behind the leader in the three path on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch and
lacked the needed kick then was caught for the place but was clear for the show. EMERY'S DREAM was well placed just off the pace, dropped back leaving
the backstretch, was urged along in the two path early on the turn, shifted four wide around the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. FLOATIE
settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the turn and failed to respond. TOP TEN DUCHESS came out some at the start then bumped with
TIZ DARBY and checked, settled at the rear the outside, fell well behind while four then five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no
factor. TIZ DARBY was bumped on both sides just after the start then clipped heels, stumbled and unseated the rider then was walked off after being caught
by the outrider. Following a stewards' inquiry, OUR FOOLISH GIRL was disqualified from third and placed sixth behind TOP TEN DUCHESS for
interference at the start. THREE-QUARTER FRACTION WAS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

Footnotes
KEARNY COUNTY dropped to the rear, settled at the back while saving ground, was roused while moving to the two path on the far turn, swung five wide
into the stretch, commenced a rally while beginning to drift out inside the three-sixteenths, closed strongly while continuing to drift out in the final furlong and
got up near the outside fence under strong handling. LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS went around the first turn in the two path, was well rated while setting the
pace, vied inside to the two path on the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, came under a drive while under heavy pressure to his outside from
RESCIND in upper stretch, lost the advantage briefly to that foe while fighting on well into the final furlong, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while
able to get the place. RESCIND went around the first turn in the four path, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the far turn, made
an outside bid into upper stretch, battled with the runner-up under a drive, held a narrow and brief advantage into the final furlong, fought into the final
sixteenth and was outfinished while clear for the show. FRANKINCENSE went three wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, came under urging late
on the backstretch then was put to the whip, dropped back near the three-eighths, was ridden along while four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the
stretch and failed to rally. TAKE CHARGE D'ORO was rated on the inside then let out near the half-mile pole, saved ground under urging through the far
turn and came up empty. CADE'S ON THE BUMP was taken under a tight hold early then keen under restraint in the three path through the first turn, raced
towards the back under reserve, came under urging in the two to three path on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch under the whip and failed to
respond. (Rail at 22 Feet)

Footnotes
HEART OF SOUL was quick to clear following mild coaxing at the start, shifted in to dictate terms in the two path, was still clear into upper stretch when put
to strong urging, held from KEHRON'S CREED, who was encouraged from the start but had to take a brief hold when in tight between rivals early,
thereupon settled mid-pack in hand and in behind horses from off the inside, went in the four path between foes into the turn, came out a path or two at the
head of the lane and put to a drive, finished well but couldn't get past in time. CUSTOM FOR CARLITA broke open the gate before the start, was within
range in the early going between rivals then outside just off the leader four deep through the turn, kept on evenly in the lane. PAPER DOLL switched off the
inside heading up the backstretch then back in before settling in behind the leaders in about the two path into the turn, asked for more in the stretch but
could make no headway late. LADY DATE was in just a hair tight at the start, shifted inside PAPER DOLL early then came back out as that rival returned
nearer the rail, settled mid-pack in the two path into the turn, was given some encouragement leaving that bend but failed to rally. LIL KYLIE was within
range outside foes stalking early, forced five to six wide on the turn and had no rally. LADY FITZGERALD raced outside foes in the rear half of the field, kept
wide in about the five path through the turn when given some coaxing leaving that bend, ran on evenly and failed to produce a bid. MY MALLORY'S ON
broke outwardly just a bit, raced last but one early in the three path through the turn, angled widest of all eight deep in upper stretch and was never near
enough to threaten. SINGING ONTHERAIL exchanged contact at the start, was outpaced early despite urging, trailed in the two path through the turn and
made no bid. BLONDIE LOX BABE exchanged a bump at the start, was urged along to chase three wide and between runners into the turn, faltered in
upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN SWAGG broke out at the start, showed good speed and set the clear pace, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, responded well
when set down in upper stretch and maintained a safe advantage under steady urging. DISAPPROVAL broke out at the start, was well placed just off the
pace on the inside, drafted behind the leader early on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths then shifted to the two path, chased the winner under a
drive in the stretch and was clearly second best. CONFEDERATE YELL was urged along on the outside, went six then five wide on the turn, turned into
upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while up for the show. WHISTLING WIND bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace,
was urged along while four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and weakened. NO MORE FOR U bumped with a foe at the start then
was in a bit tight, moved up midway down the backstretch, was urged along in the two path early on the turn, paused behind horses at the five-sixteenths
then dropped to the inside, came back off the rail under a drive in upper stretch and tired. LORD COLLIERY was restless in the gate then broke a bit slow,
angled in towards the rear of the field, went three wide early on the turn then dropped to the inside, shifted three wide into the stretch, angled out under a
drive around the three-sixteenths and failed to threaten. CHIMNEYVILLE was coaxed along off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went five
wide on the turn and failed to respond. HORACE CHARLES dropped back under urging after breaking in front, went five wide early on the turn then dropped
to three wide, swung six wide into the stretch and was no factor. CAT ON THE ROOF bumped with a rival at the start, chased the pace, went three wide on
the turn and retreated. STAR YANKEE bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along towards the rear, went two to three wide on the turn, was taken up
sharply at the five-sixteenths then pulled up in upper stretch and vanned off.

Footnotes
HANDSOME HONEY eased back and tucked inside the leading pair into the first turn content to track from about the two path, began to edge closer two to
three wide leaving the far turn, bid in mid-stretch, was clear about the sixteenth pole and held. HE'S A CLIMBER was lightly brushed at the start but had little
impact, gained forward positioned tracking inside on or just off the rail in the early going mid-pack, edged closer into the far turn, altered course out a path
and a half midway on that bend to pass a tiring horse then came back in, came out again in the stretch and ran on to get the place. MORETHANFISHIN was
in tight after the break between rivals then taken in hand and allowed to settle racing toward the rear just off the rail and between foes early, continued at the
back then advanced while inside a rival about three then four wide on the far turn swinging six deep into upper stretch, gained steadily but needed more.
COPPER FIDDLE moved clear just after the start to set the pace, was getting out just a bit into the first turn, continued to dictate terms extending the margin
while off the fence up the backstretch, was challenged in mid-stretch and weakened late. DJINN OF DJIBOUTI was bumped twice at the break, raced
mid-pack outside a rival two to three wide on the early going, advanced three to four wide on the far turn but could not sustain the effort and flattened out in
the lane. COMMANDING CANDY broke outwardly and bounced around between outside and inside rivals, settled near but off the rail at the rear into the
first turn, dropped back and switched out four wide leaving that bend, advanced past foes four to five wide on the far turn and ran on evenly in late stretch.
SLICK DUDE broke outwardly just a bit and was slightly steadied, settled under a hold outside rivals three wide at the rear into the first turn, continued
between foes up the backstretch, began to lost ground and was encouraged along past the three-eighths going in about the two to three path on the far turn,
came out in upper stretch and was not a threat. COWORKER steadied on heels just slightly in the run to the first turn, tracked off the leaders from in the
clear racing off the fence in about the three path, took slightly closer order into the far turn, went four to five wide on that bend, was empty in the stretch.
PERDIDO BAY stalked the pacesetter three wide through the first turn, lost ground on that rival up the backstretch, shifted in to the two path then to the rail
on the far turn while beginning to weaken, was eased through the stretch. (Rail at 22 Feet)

TRIVISTA went two to three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, pulled even with the leader near the seven-sixteenths, drew off in
tandem with that foe while in the two to three path on the far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch, had the rider lose his whip just inside the furlong marker and
held under a strong hand ride. POCHO'S DREAM bumped with a rival at the start, went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was ridden
along leaving the backstretch, went around the far turn in the two path, gained on the top two while three wide into the stretch, pursued the winner into the
final sixteenth and flattened out while clear for the place. TAP KING was hustled to the lead, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, set the pace while
getting pressure from the outside, was urged along while inside to the two path on the far turn, lost the advantage in the process, dropped back under a
drive in upper stretch and weakened but just held the show. CREALOCK bumped with a foe at the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the
pace, was ridden along while three wide on the far turn, gained four wide under the whip into the stretch but lacked the needed response. EXPECT ICE was
fractious in the gate, went three wide on the first turn, dropped back while urged along on the backstretch, went around the far turn in the two path and was
no factor. HAPPY GO LUCKY went four to five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, dropped back under urging passing the half-mile pole, went five
to six wide on the far turn and faltered. MR. BIG CITY broke out at the start, went three to four wide on the first turn, dropped back on the outside early on
the backstretch and retreated.

Footnotes
YES HE CAN broke just a half-step slowly at the start, was coaxed forward, pressed the pace from outside, moved clear into upper stretch and was kept to
the task. KATZARELLI was taken up just after the start, tucked in heading up the backstretch, saved ground advancing inside foes on or just off the rail
through the turn, continued to improve position to gain the place. TRANQUILITY BASE was lacking early speed, began to pick it up in the two then three
path on the turn, swung seven wide out of that bend and gained show honors. MAGI set the pace along the inside facing outside pressure, was overtaken at
the head of the stretch, switched off the inside at that juncture and came up empty. MAINTAINANCE MATT raced inside a rival mid-pack while off the
inside, went three to four wide on the turn, came out and was taken hold of in mid-stretch to avoid stricken rivals and not persevered with late. TOPSHOP
raced outside a rival mid-pack four to five wide on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and had no rally. AWE PATRIOT trailed while off the rail in the
three to four path on the turn, tried to jump a fallen rival near the sixteenth pole and lost the rider, was caught by the outrider and walked off. MAX
PANDOWDY pursued the leaders three wide into the turn, appeared to jump over a fallen rival and lost the rider, was retrieved by the outrider and walked
off. JIM'S SILVERBULLET pursued the leaders along the inside but several lengths back, switched out in upper stretch, went wrong near the sixteenth pole,
fell and was vanned off. Following a stewards' inquiry no action was taken.

Footnotes
MAYBE I CAN angled in while showing good speed, crossed over while going to the front, vied in the two path on the turn, responded well when headed in
upper stretch, shook clear inside the furlong marker and proved best under strong urging. FOR REEF'S SAKE settled off the pace, went five wide on the
turn, came six wide into the stretch, was put to a drive on the far outside and finished willingly for the place. PRINCESS TRINA bumped with a rival at the
start, was well placed just off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was asked while shifting four wide at the quarter-pole, took the lead on the outside in
upper stretch, led into the final furlong then lost the advantage back to the winner and was outfinished then just missed the place while narrowly able to get
the show. KRAFT'S RATE was bumped just after the start, settled on the outside, went five wide on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch and lacked
the needed kick. RAGATAGTAG was reserved towards the back, went two then three wide on the turn, was roused while four wide into the stretch, moved
out near the three-sixteenths and improved position. BEE BIT bumped with a rival at the start and was slow into stride, raced at the rear under reserve,
rounded the turn from the inside to the two path, came under a drive in upper stretch and improved position without threatening. BOLD ESTHER broke out
at the start, was taken in hand early then rated just off the pace, drafted along the rail on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive
and lacked the needed response. ELSIE'S KID bumped soundly with a rival at the start while also bumping with another foe, settled towards the back,
dropped to the rear while traveling awkwardly leaving the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, was taken in hand off heels outside the quarter-pole,
came six wide into the stretch, drifted out nearing the furlong marker then was straightened by the rider and failed to threaten. MT. RAIN bumped soundly
with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and failed to rally. CARRY THE ONE stalked the pace on the outside,
engaged the leader in the three path on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. (Rail at 22 Feet)

Footnotes
PIRATE'S PUNCH broke inwardly just a bit but was quick to make the lead into the first turn, dictated terms just off the rail with mild pressure from an
outside foe early, edged clear without being asked into and on the far turn, was shaken up in upper stretch and drew off under steady hand urging and
occasional flagging. SEEK THE PEAK eased back from between rivals content to stalk from about the three path into the first turn, edged a little closer three
then four wide on the far turn, drifted in a path in upper stretch under urging, was no match for the winner but held the place. SO ALIVE settled inside a rival
at the back racing on or just off the rail, was still last with much to do turning for home, came out in upper stretch and improved position inside a rival late to
annex show honors. BROTH raced well outside a rival at the tail-end going three to four deep through the first turn, edged a little closer four then five wide
on the far turn before evening out in the drive. EMPTY TOMB raced between foes heading down the home straight the first time, eased back off the leading
pair into the turn tracking from about the two path, was asked for more outside the three-eighths pole while shifting out a further path but offered no late
response. DICTATOR caught three wide into the first turn, pressed the pace briefly outside the winner, continued to chase from outside to the far turn,
dropped back and faded.

ANOTHER MYSTERY brushed the inside of the gate at the start and was last to commence, went three wide on the first turn, settled in the back half of the
field, was asked in the two path on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch, dropped in from behind horses at the three-sixteenths, rallied inside into the
final furlong and closed strongly to get up in the final sixteenth under good handling. BOTSWANA set the clear pace while near the inside, was asked on the
far turn, came out into upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while able to get the place. ARTIE'S RUMOR was rated in the second flight
on the inside, came under urging around the five-sixteenths, chased under a drive in the stretch and was out-kicked while just able to get the show.
HIERARCHY went two to three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused while three to four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch
and finished willingly to just miss the show. TELL YOUR DADDY went around the first turn in the two path, was rated in the second flight, came under urging
in the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch under the whip, shifted out behind the leader at the three-sixteenths, pursued that foe into the
final furlong and weakened. HARLAN SELECTION (ARG) was taken in hand early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved towards the rear,
raced inside to the two path while roused on the far turn and improved position. KEEP QUIET (FR) went four wide on the first turn, settled towards the back
on the outside, was roused while three wide on the far turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. KITTEN'S BOY settled on the inside,
moved to the two path early on the far turn then was roused, shifted four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. RIJEKA (IRE) dropped well behind early,
saved ground on the turns, swung four wide into the stretch, angled out under a drive around the three-sixteenths and was no factor. CONQUEST
LEMONRAID angled in early, went three wide on the first turn, settled well back in the field, went four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch,
altered course inside the furlong marker and also was no factor. TAKE THAT FOR DATA went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside towards the
front, chased three wide on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and came up empty. (Rail at 22 Feet)

MY GUITAR went three wide on the first turn, settled nicely while well off the pace, advanced late on the backstretch, paused behind the stopping
pacesetter at the seven-sixteenths, ranged up two then three wide on the far turn, was put to the whip near the five-sixteenths, took the advantage in upper
stretch, shook clear into the final furlong, drew away under the whip into the final sixteenth then was placed under a hand ride while much the best. SHAQ
JACK saved ground on the first turn, followed the runaway leader from second, gained on that foe late on the backstretch, took the lead in the two path into
the far turn, dropped to the inside while under threat from the winner around the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch and
proved no match while in a different zip code then the rest while securing the place. OUR BUCKET LIST went four to five wide on the first turn, settled off
the pace, was ridden along passing the half-mile pole, went three to four wide on the far turn and failed to respond while extremely clear for the show. FIRE
GIANT was hustled from the start, went five to six wide on the first turn and was outrun. BET ON J J brushed the outside of the gate at the start and was last
away, raced inside to the two path on the turns and showed little. RUN TO FAME moved clear early, rounded the first turn in the two path, opened up a very
large advantage, shortened stride late on the backstretch, was collared just inside the seven-sixteenths and stopped. LINEA AMARILLA went three to four
wide on the first turn, dropped back under urging on the backstretch and faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off.
