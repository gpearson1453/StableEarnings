Footnotes
DIAMOND DARLIN well rated moved to bid on the far turn dueling abreast rival into upper stretch needing full extension to clear. BETTER VIBES away
alertly set the pace through the backside being collared on the far turn, dueled inside of rival down the lane ceding grudgingly while angling out at the end.
EVEN IF slow early lagged through the far turn mustering a minor response to best the others the final eighth. MAGNA MONEY stalked the pace for a half
then faded on the far turn. EOWYN'S PARADISE was never involved. STREET VOLUME hustled along was empty on the far turn easing home.

PROMISES FOREVER was squeezed at the break and yards from the gate forcing the rider to check, swung out to upper stretch finished well in the seven
path. TEMPLEMENT a step slow through the turn saved ground to upper stretch finishing evenly along the inside. RISE TO POWER pressed in bid on the
turn then faded in upper stretch. HOPES AND PRAYERS in close at the break played no factor. WAVERLY SUNSET pressured the pace through the turn
then tired in upper stretch. PRETTY CHARLEE was never involved. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION SOUTH BEACH GIRL WAS DISQUALIFIED AND
