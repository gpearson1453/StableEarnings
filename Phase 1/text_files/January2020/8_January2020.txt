Footnotes
MIAMI CROCKETT moved off the inside and sped to the lead in opening stages, continued to hold clear around the turn, moved out wider under steady
pressure and stayed sharp. SASSY BUT SMART lacked early foot and raced in the back, began to pick up the pace along the far outside moving through
the turn, raced wide losing ground entering top stretch then finished with good energy. FRANCO'S TEAM was forwardly placed and hustled along the inside
around the turn, angled out at head of the lane and stayed on with response for share. DANZO broke well from the outside and raced in close contention
through opening stages, remained forwardly positioned through the turn and upper stretch then raced evenly in late stages and got edged for show.
MYSTERY BANK got brushed between rivals at the start, raced near mid-range then moved into stretch wide, stayed outside under left handed pressure
and lacked the needed response for late impact. ALASKAN raced in range through early stages, kept on with response around the turn then flattened out in
the lane. FENTYNOLA raced off the early speed and saved ground around the turn, prompted along the rail in stretch run and failed to rally. CAPITAN
FOFO broke out at the start then switched in a few paths nearing the turn, raced under steady pressure and moved into top stretch three wide then offered
no late rally. SEE THE SONG raced off the pace and dropped to the inside position, waited briefly near the quarter pole then angled out at head of the lane
and lacked a needed rally. GANGSTER OF LOVE was forwardly positioned out of the gate, chased in contention through early stages then failed to keep
pace through the turn and steadily faded.

Footnotes
WICKED TEMPTATIONS set the early pace under pressure from both flanks, edged away late on the turn in the two-path, turned back a challenge from
DREAM D'ORO through the stretch and held firm. DREAM D'ORO tracked from close range inside, bid along the rail turning for home but could not reach
the top one. TAPI FROST took a slight hop at the break to come away last, bid between horses three wide midway on the turn, could not sustain the rally
but ran on well enough for a share. EMOJI GUY was stacked four wide and driven outside the leaders near the quarter-pole, and faded in the stretch.
TRINNI DANCER was no factor through an inside trip. WHO IS JARETT pressed the pace outside the eventual winner for a half-mile, and gave way.

Footnotes
BERING STRAIT was away in good order and was forwardly placed moving into the first turn, remained behind the pacesetter and stalked rival down the
backstretch, hustled up near three eighths pole and coaxed around the final turn, turned for home three wide then stayed in steady pursuit for SMACK,
steadily edged up closer on rival in late stages and got up in time. SMACK held a narrow advantage in opening stages then cleared and crossed over to the
inside nearing the first turn, continued to set the pace while saving ground down the backstretch, remained the leader and tapped on the shoulder moving to
keep attention around the far turn, was put to a drive upper stretch, kept on determinedly under pressure then got wore down in final strides. OCEAN FIRE
was taken under slight restraint to settle in opening stages, positioned in range off the top pair and raced in tracking mode through early stages, remained in
a forward position along inside moving through the turn then prompted for more past the quarter pole, cut the corner entering top stretch, continued a steady
inside bid through the lane and secured share. PLATINUM PAYNTER lost some footing at the start then raced four wide entering the first turn, settled off the
early pace and raced two to three wide in early going, continued in the last flight then hustled up for response near the three eighths pole, turned for home
two to three wide, stayed under steady pressure but lacked the needed response for impact. KITTEN BY THE SEA secured inside position in the first turn,
settled while rated in the last flight down the backstretch, continued to save ground around the final turn, prompted for response at head of the lane but
offered no late rally.

Footnotes
SIZZLING ROMA pressed the early pace waiting for an opening, slipped through on the rail to take over near the five-sixteenths, opened up into the stretch,
and was under a mild drive mostly hand urged. BLUE CHICORY dueled for command outside ALPILLES, got the best of that dispute after a half-mile as the
winner rolled by inside them, and ran on clear for the place. SHANGHAISWEETHEART shifted four wide midway on the turn, could not gain on the leaders
and flattened out. MIA ANGELINA broke slowly, lagged well back toward the inside for a half, and rallied mildly between horses through the furlong grounds.
TONG SHU tracked just off the early pace three wide, and dropped back past the midway point of the turn. LADY VALENTINA stumbled at the start, raced
four wide and gave way after a half. ALPILLES contested the pace in the two-path inside BLUE CHICORY, and yielded approaching the quarter-pole.

Footnotes
BLAMELESS was off to a good start and raced three to four wide entering the first turn then cleared on top and crossed over to the inside, set the pace with
BLUE LOU BOYLE applying some pressure down the backstretch, held the edge and vied for the lead with aforementioned foe around the far turn then
shook free entering top stretch, remained under pressure from tenacious BLUE LOU BOYLE, dug in gamely under firm handling and held on. BLUE LOU
BOYLE (IRE) was forwardly positioned and prompted the pace through early stages, let out a notch and vied for the lead with BLAMELESS holding a slight
edge moving through the far turn, could not match strides at the head of the lane but stayed on with response, kept after rival gamely but could not get to
BLAMELESS in time. GRAY'S FABLE checked sharply entering the first turn, stayed inside and settle while rated through early stages, switched out a
couple paths and hustled up moving through the final turn, was set down driving four wide at head of the lane, dug in three deep at the furlong marker then
advanced past inside pair and secured share. TRAFFIC TROUBLE was allowed to settle out of the gate, remained unhurried and raced in the back through
early stages, roused through the far turn then shifted out five wide upper stretch, continued a steady outside bid and gained position. UP AND ONWARD
raced in range and tracked the top trio down the backstretch, picked up the pace and raced two to three wide moving through the far turn, continued a
steady bid and raced between foes with a furlong left to run then flattened out. SHARED LEGACY was forwardly placed in opening stages and secured
inside position in the first turn, stalked the top two leaders down the backstretch then persuaded to pick up the tempo mid-way through the far turn, saved
ground entering the stretch then failed to sustain bid and faded in final furlong. SECLUSIVE rated off the leaders, roused for response along the outside
midway through the far turn, failed to advance position then retreated.

SMASH vied outside CHADS CHOICE early, took over after six furlongs, drifted to the four-path being driven into the stretch, and widened under pressure
to the 70-yard marker before being geared down. CONSILIUM advanced three wide around the turn, and rallied to go well clear of the others. FAST ONE
stayed in range toward the inside early, moved off the rail late on the turn, and lacked a solid response. CHADS CHOICE argued the pace inside the winner,
and gave way through the stretch. PROSPECT PROJECT faded two then three wide around the turn. PREFONTAINE was roused heading into the far turn,
and had no response inside. SILENT MISCHIEF tracked outside the pacesetters early, and retreated after a half-mile. RINGLE BELLE dropped far back into
the turn, and was eased up through the stretch. This race was hand timed.

handed urging at head of the lane, shifted out wider then drifted out wide, came under right handed pressure, kicked in gear and surged clear. HIRE THE
LADY held a slim lead out of the gate then dueled for the lead racing inside of CAT'S STRAY, raced heads apart around the turn then shook free at head of
the lane, widened to a clear advantage then moved out wider under left handed pressure and got outkicked late. ANJALI dropped to the inside moving
through the backstretch then swung to the outside entering top stretch, came under right handed pressure and began to move in then steadied slightly
moving inside of GILDA F. continued a steady effort and secured share. ADAMANT was off a step slow at the start, hustled up through the turn then kept
under steady pressure racing two wide then along inside in stretch run and had a mild improve. CAT'S ASTRAY advanced to match strides with HIRE THE
LADY in opening stages, continued to battle heads apart around the turn, could not match strides at head of the lane but stayed on with response then
came up empty in late stages. PLAY THAT TONE raced under steady urging and chased three wide around the turn then flattened out in the lane.
SWEEPENO was off a step slow at the start, lacked speed and raced in the back, saved ground into the stretch then shifted out and failed to rally. THE #6

Footnotes
PRINCESS LATINA set the early pace inside, moved clear under pressure turning for home, and responded well to keep ARCELOR at bay through the
closing yards. ARCELOR was covered up behind the leaders for a half-mile, moved out near the quarter-pole with aim outside the pacesetter, finished
determinedly but could not quite reach her. TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR raced in striking range three wide, but lacked a solid response. MIDNIGHT MIRACLE had
the two-path on the turn, moved inside for the drive and did not become a factor. LIL B QUICK prompted the pace, lodged a mild bid between horses
passing the three-eighths, but gave way into the lane. SHE TAKES HEART became restless in the gate prior to the start, was slow to get going, and
remained outrun. MARY LEE AND ME faded steadily three wide.

Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE HORIZON tucked in along the rail behind the leaders, tipped to the two-path in upper stretch, caught ROSA STAR from outside past the
eighth-pole and kicked away. TRIESTE (BRZ) got bumped by PIONEEROF NEW YORK at the start, moved inside trailing for six furlongs, rallied between
horses in deep stretch and was up inside COMIC KITTEN to grab second. COMIC KITTEN tracked the pace two wide to the far turn, shifted out with aim in
the four-path at the top of the lane, hung outside the winner in deep stretch and yielded the place in the last yards. RECESS raced two to three wide on the
turns, moved outside for the drive and finished one-paced. ROSA STAR set the pace inside to the stretch, and weakened into the final furlong.
BARBADOLLA took the first turn four wide, and failed to become a factor. MAGIC RIVER raced in the second flight at or near the two-path, and posed no
threat. PIONEEROF NEW YORK broke out bumping TRIESTE at the start, prompted the pace outside ROSA STAR to the stretch, and tired.
