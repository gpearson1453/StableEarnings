SHINING SOURCE was taken back at once, advanced four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew clear. GO FOR
A STROLL pressed the pace of the dueling leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, opened a clear
margin into the stretch but could not match strides with the winner late. NEXT AFFAIR broke sharply to dispute the pace from between foes and gave way
through the final furlong. SUNSCREEN was away in good order then raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the second turn and
weakened in the drive. STREAKS BRO vied for the lead from the inside for a half and weakened.
