Footnotes
LINCOLN CITY took the early lead and angled in, set a pressured pace inside, inched away a bit off the rail into the stretch, battled outside the runner-up
through the final furlong then responded when headed between horses a sixteenth out and gamely prevailed under urging between foes. BORDER TOWN
broke slowly, angled in and saved ground chasing the pace, moved up inside then bid along the rail in the final furlong, put a head in front a sixteenth out
and continued willingly but was outgamed. COMMANDING CHIEF saved ground stalking the pace, came out leaving the second turn and three deep into
the stretch, bid three wide past midstretch and continued gamely to the end. MURALIST angled in and prompted the pace outside the winner, continued a
bit off the rail through the stretch and was outfinished. GO DADDY GO stalked outside a rival then just off the rail leaving the second turn and into the
stretch, continued alongside a foe in the drive and lacked the needed rally. CAPE POINT pulled his way along three deep into and on the first turn, stalked
outside a rival to the stretch and did not rally. CARDIFF CAY saved ground chasing the pace, came out leaving the second turn and again into the stretch
and could not offer the necessary response. DA KINE pulled his way along a bit off the rail then outside a rival, chased just off the fence, came out in the
stretch and also lacked a rally.

turn, inched away into the stretch, fought back when challenged past midstretch and held on gamely under left handed urging. CLASSY RULER stalked
three deep then bid four wide a half mile out, tracked outside a foe on the second turn and three deep into the stretch, bid outside the winner past midstretch
and continued willingly but could not get by. LAST FIRST KISS stalked inside then bid along the rail leaving the backstretch, dueled inside, was not a match

Footnotes
WILL DANCER sped to the early lead, inched away and set the pace inside, came a bit off the rail into the stretch and held on gamely under urging. CROSS
TOWN between horses early, pressed the pace outside the winner then stalked off the rail to the stretch and was clearly second best. DERBY STORM four
wide into the first turn, stalked off the rail then inside, came out into the stretch and bested the others. STARSHIP CHEWY angled in and settled outside a
rival, split horses on the second turn, found the rail in the stretch and improved position. DARKHAWK had speed three deep between foes then stalked off
the rail to the stretch and weakened. FORT DODGE broke in a bit, angled in and saved ground off the pace, cut the corner into the stretch and lacked a
rally. HYPERSONIC broke a bit slowly, went six wide into the first turn, stalked five wide, continued four wide on the second turn and into the stretch and
weakened. MOANA LUNA broke in and bumped a rival, five wide into the first turn, stalked four wide between horses, went three deep into and out of the
second turn and also weakened. THE EASY WAY a bit slow into stride, settled outside, came four wide into the stretch, gave way and was eased in the final
furlong. FORTNITE DANCE bumped at the start, drifted out into the first turn, angled in and saved ground off the pace, also gave way and was eased in the
drive.

Footnotes
STORMING LADY stalked a bit off the rail then inside to the stretch, came out for room in midstretch, bid between rivals under urging to gain the lead in
deep stretch and gamely prevailed. DEVILS DANCE three deep early, dueled outside a rival, put a head in front in midstretch, was three wide in deep
stretch and continued willingly late. HOLLY HUNDY angled in and stalked inside, came out into the stretch, steadied in tight between foes past the eighth
pole and continued gamely between horses to the wire. SMOOVIE stalked outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch, was fanned out a bit in
midstretch and found her best stride late four wide on the line. CREATIVE INSTINCT had good early speed and dueled inside, fought back a bit off the rail
in deep stretch and was outfinished. TONAHUTU (IRE) saved ground chasing the pace, continued along the rail in the stretch and finished willingly. LOVE
AND PEACE (FR) chased between horses, came out some in the stretch and had a mild late bid. FLOWER POINT was in a good position chasing the pace
three wide to the stretch and could not summon the necessary late kick. POSIT stalked the pace outside a rival, came out leaving the turn and four wide into
the stretch and did not rally. KIM K a bit slow to begin, dropped back inside then settled a bit off the rail, came out into the stretch and was not a threat.
Following a stewards' inquiry and a claim of foul by the trainer of HOLLY HUNDY against STORMING LADY, the latter was disqualified and placed third for
interference in midstretch.

Footnotes
BAST stalked three deep then off the rail on the turn, came three wide into the stretch, bid three wide under left handed urging in midstretch to gain the lead
nearing the sixteenth pole and inched away under a hold late. AUBERGE a bit slow into stride, went up inside to duel for the lead, fought back in the stretch,
could not match the winner in the final sixteenth but bested the others. GOLDEN PRINCIPAL sped to the early lead a bit off the rail, dueled outside the
runner-up, battled between horses in the stretch and held clear for the show. ORQUIDIAS BIZ dropped back off the rail, came four wide into the stretch and
lacked a bid in the drive. K P DREAMIN chased between horses then off the rail on the turn, came out into the stretch and weakened. LOVELY LILIA
stalked a bit off the rail then inside on the backstretch and turn, came out into the stretch and had little left for the drive.
